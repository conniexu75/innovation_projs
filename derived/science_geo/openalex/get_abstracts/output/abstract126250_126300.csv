Phosphorylation of serine 256 of AQP2 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been shown, but its relation to vasopressin-regulated translocation has not been elucidated. To address this question, wild type (WT) AQP2 and a mutant with alanine in place of serine 256 of AQP2 (S256A) were expressed in LLC-PK1 cells by electroporation. Measurements by a stopped-flow light-scattering method revealed that the osmotic water permeability (Pf) of LLC-PK1 cells transfected with WT was 69.6 ± 6.5 μm/s (24.8 ± 2.2 μm/s for mock-transfected), and stimulation by 500 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP increased thePf by 85 ± 12%. When S256A AQP2 was transfected, the cAMP-dependent increase in thePf was only 8 ± 5%. After cAMP stimulation, the increase in surface expression of AQP2 determined by surface biotin labeling was 4 ± 10%, significantly less than that for WT (88 ± 5%). In addition, an in vivo[32P]orthophosphate labeling assay demonstrated significant phosphorylation of WT AQP2 and only minimal phosphorylation of S256A AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells. Our results indicated that serine 256 of AQP2 is necessary for regulatory exocytosis and that cAMP-responsive redistribution of AQP2 may be regulated by phosphorylation of AQP2.

The urine concentration system in the kidney is regulated mainly by vasopressin, an antidiuretic hormone that increases the osmotic water permeability of the collecting duct cells, resulting in bulk reabsorption of free water (1Harris Jr., H.W.

The cellular actions of vasopressin in the collecting duct cell have been partially resolved since the identification of the vasopressin water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) 1The abbreviations used are: AQP2aquaporin-2WTwild typeePBSphosphate-buffered salineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumcpt-cAMP8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP;Pf, osmotic water permeabilityPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4Fushimi K.

Vasopressin has been shown to induce regulatory redistribution of AQP2 from endosomal compartments to the apical membrane (6Nielsen S. Chou C.L. Marples D. Christensen E.I. Kishore B.K.

These observations have directly proved the shuttle hypothesis that exo- and endocytosis of water channel-containing vesicles account for the regulatory effects of vasopressin on water permeability of the collecting duct cells (9Hays R.M. Franki N. Ding G. Kidney Int. 1987; 31: 530-537Google Scholar,10Handler J.S. Am. J.

It has been shown that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of AQP2 expressed in the Xenopus oocyte slightly increased osmotic water permeability without changing AQP2 surface expression (11Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Google Scholar), but the increase was far too small to account for the dramatic increase in water permeability of collecting duct cells. Many channels have been shown to be functionally regulated by their phosphorylation (12Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Google Scholar), but the direct regulation of AQP2 channel functions through phosphorylation is minimal at best and is still controversial (13Lande M.B. Jo I. Zeidel M.L. Somers M. Harris Jr., H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5552-5557Google Scholar). On the other hand, the physiological significance of regulatory effects on AQP2 trafficking has been emphasized. Regulatory delivery and sorting of membrane proteins have been observed in many cell types (14Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 15Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Google Scholar). Many vesicle-associated proteins that regulate vesicle trafficking have been identified, and some of them have been shown to exist in association with AQP2-containing vesicles (16Jo I. Harris H.W. Amendt-Raduege A.M. Majewski R.R. Hammond T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1876-1880Google Scholar). Recently, extrinsic expression of AQP2 in kidney-derived cell lines has been reported, and cAMP-dependent regulatory exocytosis has been shown (17Valenti G. Frigeri A. Ronco P.M. D'Ettorre C. Svelto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24365-24370Google Scholar). c-Myc-tagged AQP2 was expressed in LLC-PK1 cells, a cell type that is known to express the vasopressin type 2 receptor and increase intracellular cAMP concentration upon vasopressin stimulation, and vasopressin-induced translocation of the channel was observed (18Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar). Although AQP2 was transferred to the basolateral membrane rather than to the apical membrane where AQP2 is bound in intact kidney cells, the study showed that LLC-PK1 cells are suitable for studying the regulatory translocation of AQP2. Furthermore, the study postulated that AQP2 itself is one of the key components of the vesicle trafficking system. This notion raises the possibility that in addition to its regulation through vesicle-associated proteins, the vesicle trafficking system may also be regulated through modifications of AQP2. In this study, by expressing wild-type and mutant AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells, we examined the roles of phosphorylation of serine 256 (a residue phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase) in the regulatory exocytosis of AQP2. Demonstrations of the regulatory effects of channel phosphorylation on channel translocation would provide new insights into the cell biology of membrane trafficking. Serine 256 of rat AQP2 was replaced with alanine by polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis to produce the S256A AQP2 mutant. The nucleotide sequences of both strands of the mutant were verified by a fluorescence sequencer (model 373A, Applied Biosystems). Polymerase chain reaction fragment codings for open reading frames of wild-type (WT) and S256A AQP2 (4Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Google Scholar) were subcloned into the HindIII andXbaI site of the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Transfection was performed by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Subconfluent cells were detached from dishes by trypsin treatment and were suspended. ∼1 × 107 cells suspended in 600 μl of PBS were electroporated at 350 V with 960 microfarads, using 20 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA. In most experiments, cells ∼24 h after transfection were used. In each transfection, 2 μg of pcDNA3.1/lacZplasmid (Invitrogen) was co-transfected to verify transfection efficiency. Examinations using the β-Gal staining kit (Invitrogen) revealed that >70% of the cells were expressing thelacZ gene. Osmotic water permeability of LLC-PK1 cells was measured by a light-scattering method using a SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, United Kingdom) equipped with a circulating water bath. Transfected cells grown on plastic dishes were detached by incubating with 0.25% trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were collected, and trypsin was neutralized by washing twice and incubating with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for a few hours at 37 °C in a polystyrene tube to prevent attachment of cells. The cells were then suspended with DMEM at a concentration of ∼5 × 106cells/ml. In some experiments, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 500 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (cpt-cAMP) for 30 min at 37 °C before the assay. The cell suspension was abruptly mixed with PBS containing 600 mm mannitol, and cells were imposed with 300 mm inwardly directed osmotic gradient. A decrease in cell volume due to osmotic water efflux driven by the osmotic gradient was monitored as the time-dependent increase in 90° scattered light intensity monitored at 466 nm. A light intensity trace was obtained in each sample by averaging three to seven measurements. Data were fit to single exponential curves, and osmotic water permeability (Pf) was determined as described (19Agre P. Smith B.L. Baumgarten R. Preston G.M. Pressman E. Wilson P. Illum N. Anstee D.J. Lande M.B. Zeidel M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1050-1058Google Scholar) by iteratively solving the following equation with Mathematica software (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL), dV(t)/dt=Pf×SAV×vw×(Osmin/V(t)−Osmout)Equation 1 where V(t) is cell volume at timet, SAV is initial cell surface area to volume ratio (6 × 10−5 cm−1, calculated from the average cell diameter of 10 μm measured by phase-contrast microscopy), vw is the molar volume of water (vw = 18 cm3/mol),Osmin is osmolarity inside the cell, andOsmout is osmolarity outside the cell. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed as described (20Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Yamamoto T. Hayashi M. Furukawa T. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Ishibashi K. Kawasaki M. Kihara I. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F573-F582Google Scholar). Cells grown on a 30-mm plastic dish were treated with 150 μl of 1 × reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) for 15 min. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Ten μl of the supernatant was denatured in SDS sample buffer (1.5% SDS, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) at 80 °C for 10 min, resolved in 10–20% gradient SDS-PAGE for 1 h with a 40-mA current, and electrotransferred to an ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Corp.) using a Fastblot semi-dry blotting apparatus (Biometra, Goettingen, Germany). After the membrane was blocked with Superblock (Promega) for 1 h at 23 °C and washed once with TBS-T (20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4), it was incubated with affinity-purified antibody against a synthetic peptide corresponding to 15 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of rat AQP2 (4Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Nature. 1993; 361: 549-552Google Scholar) diluted at ∼1 μg/ml in TBS-T, washed three times with TBS-T, incubated with a 1:200 dilution of biotin-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector, Burlingame, CA), washed, and incubated again with a 1:50 dilution of ABC mixture (Vector). The blot was visualized by ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL mini-camera (Amersham Corp.). 24 h after transfection, LLC-PK1 cells were washed with PBS and detached from the dishes by incubating with 0.25% trypsin, 50 mmEDTA. The cells were collected and washed twice with DMEM, incubated with DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C, and washed once with ice-cold PBS. ∼1 × 105 cells were suspended with 1 ml of ice-cold biotinylation buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) and incubated for 45 min with gentle rotation at 4 °C (21Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Google Scholar). The cells were then rinsed and suspended with 1 ml of lysis buffer (Promega), and the cell lysates were precleaned by incubation with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) for 1 h at 4 °C using an end-over-end rotator. Precleaned lysates were incubated with 1:1,000 diluted affinity-purified anti-rat AQP2 antibody at 4 °C for 1 h with end-over-end rotation. 50 μl of protein A-agarose was then added and incubated 24 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. The samples were washed 5 times with lysis buffer, suspended with 20 μl of SDS sample buffer, denatured at 80 °C for 10 min, loaded onto 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and electrotransferred as described above. Blots were blocked as described above, reacted with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), and visualized using the same method as that used for immunoblotting. In some experiments half of the immunoprecipitated sample was electrophoresed, blotted, and examined by ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence to ascertain that the amount of immunoprecipitated AQP2 from each sample was similar. Linearity of the biotin quantitation in the range of the amount used in our experiments was confirmed by applying a serial dilution of the samples to SDS-PAGE and then blotting and visualizing as described above. About 106 transfected cells were metabolically labeled by incubation with 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h in 1 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C. 500 μm cpt-cAMP was then added to the medium and incubated for 30 min. The cells were pelleted, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and suspended with 1 ml of lysis buffer. After 15 min of gentle mixing, AQP2 was immunoprecipitated as described for surface biotinylation, resolved with 10–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. WT AQP2 and a mutant AQP2 in which serine 256 was replaced with alanine (S256A) were expressed in LLC-PK1 cells by electroporation, and transient expression of AQP2 was examined by Western blotting (Fig.1). Immunoreactive AQP2 was not detected in either native LLC-PK1 cells (data not shown) or LLC-PK1 cells transfected with mock vector, indicating that LLC-PK1 cells do not express an AQP2-like protein. A predominant band of ∼29 kDa was detected in lysates from cells transfected with WT AQP2. The band was not detected with preimmune serum (data not shown). Interestingly, dispersed bands corresponding to glycosylated forms of AQP2 that were detected in membrane fractions from rat kidney medulla and oocytes expressing rat AQP2 (20Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Yamamoto T. Hayashi M. Furukawa T. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Ishibashi K. Kawasaki M. Kihara I. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F573-F582Google Scholar) were not observed. A similar result was obtained by expressing c-Myc-tagged AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells (18Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar), indicating that AQP2 is not properly glycosylated in LLC-PK1 cells. However, in view of the previous observations that first, glycosylation of AQP2 is not necessary for proper folding and assembly as well as plasma membrane expression of AQP2 and second, that the non-glycosylated form of AQP2 possesses a function identical to that of the wild-type AQP2 water channel (22Bai L. Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5171-5176Google Scholar), it follows that a lack of the glycosylated form of AQP2 expressed in LLC-PK1 cells would have little effect in studying AQP2 function and trafficking. When S256A AQP2 was expressed in LLC-PK1 cells, the identical staining of a band of ∼29 kDa shows similar expression efficiency, provided that the immunoreactivity of the WT and S256A AQP2 is the same. To examine the functional expression of WT and S256A AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells, the osmotic water permeability of the plasma membrane of LLC-PK1 cells transfected with constructs was examined by a stopped-flow light-scattering method (Fig. 2). Light-scattering traces in Fig. 2 A show the time course of volume increase in response to inward osmotic gradient. Interestingly, without cAMP stimulation LLC-PK1 cells transfected with wild-type AQP2 showed faster volume shrinkage than did mock-transfected cells. CalculatedPf was about three times larger than the control, and the increase of Pf was ∼80% inhibited by preincubation of cells with 50 μm HgCl2 (data not shown), which is compatible with the characteristics of aquaporin water channels (23Ma T. Frigeri A. Tsai S.T. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22756-22764Google Scholar). In contrast to the previous observation (18Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar), which showed that Pf of LLC-PK1 cells transfected with AQP2 was similar to that of the control without forskolin or vasopressin stimulation, our results indicated that AQP2 was constitutively expressed in LLC-PK1 cell plasma membrane without cAMP stimulation. This constitutive expression may be partially due to the larger amount of expressed AQP2 or to the lack of cell polarity in our experimental condition. Subsequently, we examined the effects of cAMP on the Pf. Suspended LLC-PK1 cells expressing WT AQP2 were incubated with 500 μm cpt-cAMP for 30 min at 37 °C, and the Pf was measured. A significant increase in the Pf was observed after this treatment, showing a regulatory enhancement of Pf in LLC-PK1 cells expressing WT AQP2. In contrast, when LLC-PK1 cells were transfected with S256A AQP2, the Pf was comparable with that of LLC-PK1 cells transfected with WT AQP2 without cAMP stimulation, but cAMP treatment failed to increase thePf. These results suggested that serine 256 is required for a cAMP-dependent regulatory increase in thePf of LLC-PK1 cells expressing AQP2. To quantitatively determine the surface expression of WT and S256A AQP2, a cell-surface labeling method using biotin was employed. LLC-PK1 cells transfected with WT or S256A AQP2 were labeled with water-soluble Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, and biotin-labeled AQP2 was immunoprecipitated and visualized. AQP2 expressed in the surface plasma membrane was quantified as biotin-labeled AQP2 (21Gottardi C.J. Dunbar L.A. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F285-F295Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, biotin-labeled AQP2 was detected without cAMP stimulation in LLC-PK1 cells transfected with WT or S256A AQP2, indicating constitutive surface expression of AQP2 and the S256A mutant. After cAMP treatment, surface expression of WT AQP2 increased by ∼80% (Fig. 3 B). This result, together with the observation of a cAMP-dependent increase in thePf of LLC-PK1 cells expressing WT AQP2, proved the existence of cAMP-dependent regulatory trafficking of AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells as well as the constitutive pathway. However, when serine 256 was replaced with alanine, surface expression of the mutant did not increase after cAMP stimulation, suggesting the significant role of serine 256 in cAMP-dependent regulatory exocytosis of AQP2. Having shown the considerable importance of serine 256 of AQP2, we studied cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of WT and S256A AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells to examine the role of channel phosphorylation in the trafficking process. As shown in Fig. 4, in vivo phosphorylation of AQP2 was detected without cAMP stimulation, and cAMP treatment increased the phosphorylation by about 39 ± 8% (mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments). On the other hand, in vivo phosphorylation of S256A AQP2 was very limited even after cAMP stimulation, showing that the major phosphorylation site of AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells is serine 256 and that cAMP stimulation increased phosphorylated AQP2. cAMP-independent basal phosphorylation of WT AQP2 could be either due to basal activity of intracellular protein kinase A in LLC-PK1 cells or phosphorylation of AQP2 by other kinases. The slight phosphorylation observed in the S256A mutant may indicate weak phosphorylation of amino acid residues other than serine 256 of AQP2. Although phosphopeptide mapping was not done in this study, when our results are taken together with those of the previous phosphopeptide analyses of AQP2 in oocytes (11Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Google Scholar) and in rat kidney medulla (24Nishimoto G. Nielsen S. Yasui M. Li D. Aperia A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1271Google Scholar), it can be concluded that the major phosphorylation site of AQP2 in LLC-PK1 cells is serine 256. Expression of AQP2 deficient of serine 256 (a consensus phosphorylation site for protein kinase A) in LLC-PK1 cells revealed that serine 256 is required for cAMP-dependent regulatory exocytosis of AQP2. Assessments by functional assay and surface biotin labeling confirmed translocation of WT AQP2 to the plasma membrane upon cAMP stimulation. In contrast, cAMP-dependent regulatory exocytosis of an AQP2 mutant with alanine in place of serine 256 (S256A) was not significant. In addition, in vivophosphorylation of WT AQP2 expressed in LLC-PK1 cells was shown to occur and was enhanced by cAMP stimulation, while phosphorylation of S256A AQP2 was minimal. Taken together, our results indicated that phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 may be required for regulatory exocytosis of AQP2. Although it has been well known that functions of many channel proteins are modulated through protein phosphorylation (12Levitan I.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Google Scholar), our results provide the interesting notion that the translocation of the channel protein may be regulated by phosphorylation of the channel itself. Our finding suggests that the major passenger of the vesicle trafficking system may be a site of the regulation. This postulation is compatible with the previous prediction that AQP2 itself is a crucial component of a regulated vesicle-recycling system (18Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar). There have been numerous reports showing cAMP-dependent regulatory trafficking of secretory vesicles and membrane proteins (25Bradbury N.A. Jilling T. Berta G. Sorscher E.J. Bridges R.J. Kirk K.L. Science. 1992; 256: 530-532Google Scholar, 26Brignoni M. Pignataro O.P. Rodriguez M.L. Alvarez A. Vega-Salas D.E. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Salas P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1931-1943Google Scholar); however, most of them have suggested that vesicle-associated proteins are sites of regulation (14Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 27Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Dohke Y. Hara-Yokoyama M. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Furuyama S. Sugiya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13130-13134Google Scholar). It has been shown that trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator is regulated by cAMP (15Bradbury N.A. Bridges R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1-C24Google Scholar, 28Schwiebert E.M.

Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1642-1648Google Scholar), but regulatory effects of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator phosphorylation on exo/endocytosis of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator have not been known. According to the shuttle hypothesis (10Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F375-F382Google Scholar), phosphorylation of AQP2 at serine 256 may be required for vesicle trafficking processes including transferring, docking, and fusing of AQP2-containing endosomes toward the plasma membrane (14Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar). From accumulated observations, it is conceived that the AQP2 recycling system is composed of cytoskeletal components (30Sabolic I. Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 165-175Google Scholar, 31Holmgren K. Magnusson K.E. Franki N. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C672-C677Google Scholar, 32Simon H. Gao Y. Franki N. Hays R.M.

Macaluso F. Gao Y. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C792-C797Google Scholar, 35Franki N. Macaluso F. Schubert W. Gunther L. Hays R.M. Am. J.

Physiol. 1993; 265: C757-C762Google Scholar, 36Ding G.H. Franki N. Condeelis J. Hays R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C9-C16Google Scholar) and phosphorylation of several of the vesicle-associated proteins (37Harris Jr., H.W. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1991; 1: 1114-1122Google Scholar) have been shown. In our experiments, the increment in 32P labeling of WT AQP2 was not proportional to the increment in channel surface expression, and apparent phosphorylation of WT AQP2 without cAMP stimulation was observed (Fig. 4). These observations may indicate that phosphorylation of AQP2 is not sufficient for exocytosis to occur. Thus, rather than being the initial regulatory effect on the translocation machinery, phosphorylation of AQP2 may be one of a series of regulatory processes. At the least, our results confirm that the phosphorylation of AQP2 plays a significant role in a series of the translocation signaling processes. When transfected cells were examined immunohistochemically, results are qualitatively consistent with the conclusions from the data on water permeability and surface biotinylation, and after cAMP stimulation, a slight increment in basolateral staining was observed (data not shown) as in the previous study (18Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive surface expression of AQP2 and smaller cAMP-dependent changes were noticed, indicating that the dynamics of AQP2 trafficking in LLC-PK1 cells may be slightly different from those in natural collecting duct cells. However, in preliminary experiments with a cell line derived from OMCD cells (38Furuno M. Uchida S. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F854-F860Google Scholar), results were similar to those observed in LLC-PK1 cells, suggesting that although there may be some limitations, observations in LLC-PK1 cells are relevant to the collecting duct cells. We found that the appearance of AQP2 in plasma membrane and an increment in Pf are well correlated in WT and mutant channels, suggesting that normal and mutant channels have the same permeability and that phosphorylation of serine 256 of AQP2 did not significantly change single channel water permeability in contrast to the previous study in oocytes (11Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10384-10387Google Scholar). Thus, it can be concluded that the number of AQP2 channels, rather than single channel water permeability, is critical for vasopressin regulation of water permeability in collecting duct cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014237818,"Interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) cooperate to induce the expression of many gene products during inflammation. The present report demonstrates that a portion of this cooperativity is mediated by synergism between two distinct transcription factors: signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). IFNγ and TNFα synergistically induce expression of mRNAs encoding interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1, Mig (monokine induced by γ-interferon), and RANTES (regulated on activation normalTcell expressed andsecreted) in normal but not STAT1-deficient mouse fibroblasts, indicating a requirement for STAT1. Transient transfection assays in fibroblasts using site-directed mutants of a 1.3-kilobase pair sequence of the IRF-1 gene promoter revealed that the synergy was dependent upon two sequence elements; a STAT binding element and a κB motif. Artificial constructs containing a single copy of both a STAT binding element and a κB motif linked to the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter were able to mediate synergistic response to IFNγ and TNFα; such response varied with both the relative spacing and the specific sequence of the regions between these two sites. Cooperatively responsive sequence constructs bound both STAT1α and NF-κB in nuclear extracts prepared from IFNγ- and/or TNFα-stimulated fibroblasts, although binding of individual factors was not cooperative. Thus, the frequently observed synergy between IFNγ and TNFα in promoting inflammatory response depends in part upon cooperation between STAT1α and NF-κB, which is most likely mediated by their independent interaction with one or more components of the basal transcription complex.

A variety of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones trigger phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors termed signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) via one or more members of the Janus (Jak) family of protein tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs assemble in dimeric or oligomeric form, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequence motifs or STAT binding elements (SBEs) (12Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Google Scholar). IFNγ has been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1α, and a homodimeric form of STAT1α binds to the IFNγ-activation sequence (13Decker T. Lew D.J. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 927-932Google Scholar), an SBE that has been identified as a critical sequence motif involved in the transcriptional activation of many IFN-inducible genes including the IRF-1 and ICAM-1 genes (14Sims S.H.

The κB sequence motif has been shown to be an essential cis-acting regulatory element for mediating the TNF-, interleukin-1-, and lipopolysaccharide-induced transcriptional activation of multiple cytokines and cell surface molecules (18Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Google Scholar, 19Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Leonardo M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Google Scholar, 20Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Google Scholar). Although this sequence motif is recognized by members of the Rel homology family, including NF-κB1 (p50/p105), NF-κB2 (p52/p100), RelA, c-Rel, and RelB, various forms of the κB sequence motif have been shown to exhibit differential affinity for and functional response to different dimeric combinations of Rel family proteins. Cell type-specific expression of the Rel family members also mediates specificity for κB-dependent gene expression. Furthermore, members of the Rel family have been shown to physically and functionally interact with members of other transcription factor families (21Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishino Y. Mukaida N.

The combination of these variables generates high potential for diversity in the control of gene expression during inflammation. Components of the JAK-STAT and the κB signaling pathways appear to be indispensable for stimulus-dependent, transcriptional activation of many inflammatory genes. Furthermore, SBE and κB motifs are found in the promoter regions of many inflammatory genes. Many studies have reported functional synergy between TNFα and IFNγ in promoting inflammatory function and gene expression, some of which could involve an interplay between STAT1 and κB binding factors (3Barker J.N.W.N. Sarma V. Mitra R.S. Dixit V.M. Nickoloff B.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 605-608Google Scholar, 4Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1322-1332Google Scholar, 5Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A.

The present study was undertaken to determine whether IFNγ-activated STAT1 can cooperate with TNFα-induced NF-κB to promote enhanced transcription. The results show that IFNγ and TNFα synergize to induce expression of several genes that contain both SBE and κB motifs. The findings indicate that both the SBE and κB motifs are required for cooperativity and that the synergistic function of STAT1α and NF-κB appear to result from independent activation and recognition of cognate nucleotide sequence motifs.

These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm nonessential amino acid solution, 10 mm sodium pyruvate, 20 mm ofl-glutamine. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (complete medium) and subcultured twice weekly. Prior to use in experiments, the cells were grown to confluence in 100- or 150-mm diameter culture dishes and then transferred to medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h in order to deprive growth factor. A cDNA encoding mouse IRF-1 (25Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T.

Heeger P.S. Neilson E.G. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1182-1189Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The nucleotide sequences were independently confirmed. The plasmid encoding GAPDH was obtained from Dr. David Stern (Columbia University, New York, NY). Methods for plasmid DNA preparations were as described in Sambrooket al. (31Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). One μg of plasmid DNA or 100 ng of PCR products were radiolabeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. The resultant specific activity was approximately 108 cpm/μg, which was used at 107 cpm/blot. Each assay utilized confluent monolayer of fibroblasts cultured in 100-mm diameter plastic Petri dishes for preparation of total RNA. After treatment of the cells with the indicated stimuli, total cellular RNA was extracted by the guanidine isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (32Chirgwin J.J. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5311Google Scholar). Samples of total RNA (5 μg) were separated on a 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel and subsequently blotted onto MAGNA nylon membrane with 20 × SSC by capillary transfer according to previously published methods (31Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.Google Scholar). The RNA was cross-linked to the membrane with a UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The blots were prehybridized for 8–12 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 5 × SSC, 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.25 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) and then hybridized with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of radiolabeled cDNA plasmid probe at 42 °C for 16–24 h. After hybridization, blots were washed with 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC for 30 min at room temperature followed by two washes at 55 °C. The blots were then exposed using XAR-5 x-ray film with intensifying screens at −70 °C. The luciferase reporter constructs containing the 1.3-kb IRF-1 promoter was kindly provided by Dr. Bryan Williams (Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation). The SBE site at positions −123 to −113 and the κB site at positions −49 to −40 of the IRF-1 promoter (14Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar) were respectively mutated in the 1.3-kb 5′-flanking sequence of the IRF-1 gene by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis as described previously (33Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Google Scholar). The mutant sequence utilized for the SBE and the κB were TTCCCtcc and GtGGAATCaC, respectively. Lowercase letters represent the mutant nucleotides. One or two copies of the IRF-1 SBE or the IP-10 κB2 were placed in front of the −105 or the −81 base pair herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (34McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Google Scholar) linked to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene (pTK-105 CAT) (35Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar) or the luciferase gene (pTK-105 Luc or pTK-81 Luc) (36De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. Deluca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Google Scholar). These constructs were prepared by ligating the synthetic oligonucleotides (see below) into restriction enzyme sites of the reporter plasmids. To generate constructs containing different nucleotide spacing between the IRF-1 SBE and the κB2 sites, one or more SalI linkers (GGTCGACC) were placed between the two sites. The sequences of these reporter gene constructs were confirmed. Transfection of the luciferase and the CAT reporter genes into fibroblasts or NIH3T3 cells were as described previously (5Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106 cells/150-mm diameter dish 24 h prior to transfection. 30 μg of reporter luciferase construct plasmid DNA were transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (300 μg/ml DEAE-dextran) for 20 min at room temperature. After the incubation, the cells were subjected to dimethyl sulfoxide shock for 1 min (10% dimethyl sulfoxide in phosphate-buffered saline), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, replenished with fresh culture medium, and cultured for 2 h. To standardize transfection efficiencies, the transfected cells were then harvested in trypsin-EDTA solution, pooled, and seeded in four 100-mm diameter Petri dishes. The cells were cultured in medium containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h to deprive growth factors and then stimulated with IFNγ and/or TNFα for 16 h for the CAT reporter gene and for 8 h for the luciferase reporter gene, respectively. After stimulation, the cells were washed and extracted in lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was assayed using reagents provided by Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μg of extract protein were utilized in each assay. CAT activity was assessed by determination of the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol into acetylated forms detected by thin layer chromatography as described previously (35Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). The acetylated products were quantified using a phosphorescence detection system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA).

(14Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar). The IP-10 κB2 sequence was taken from Ohmori and Hamilton (33Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6677-6688Google Scholar, 37Ohmori Y. Tebo J. Nedospasov S. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17684-17690Google Scholar). Lowercase letters represent the bases included for creating restriction sites. Underlined sequences represent the consensus sequences for the SBE and κB elements, respectively. Boldface type indicates the substituted bases for mutation. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystem DNA synthesizer (model 381A) or obtained from Ransom Hill Bioscience Inc. (Ramona, CA). Double-stranded oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing the complementary single strands. A DNA fragment corresponding to the region between −129 and −37 of the IRF-1 promoter (14Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar) was generated by PCR using a sense oligonucleotide of the IRF-1 SBE and an antisense oligonucleotide of the IRF-1 κB as primers, and the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 1.3-kb IRF-1 promoter was used as a template. A mutant fragment was also generated by using a sense oligonucleotide of mut1 SBE and antisense oligonucleotide mutIRF-1κB as described above. Double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dCTP in a fill-in reaction for 5′ protruding ends. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were radiolabeled with T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the method of Dignam et al.(38Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) as described previously (5Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244Google Scholar, 37Ohmori Y. Tebo J. Nedospasov S. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17684-17690Google Scholar). After stimulation, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times, harvested, and resuspended in 300 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin) for 10 min on ice. The cells were then lysed in 0.6% Nonidet P-40 by vortexing for 10 s. Nuclei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 s, washed with 300 μl of buffer A, and resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and briefly sonicated on ice. Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) by using the protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad). For binding reactions, nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were incubated in 12.5 μl of total reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.25 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at 4 °C. The32P-labeled oligonucleotide (∼5 × 105cpm) was then added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. In some experiments, antibodies against NF-κB1, RelA, c-Rel, STAT1, STAT3, and Sp1 were included in the reaction mixture. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.25 × TBE buffer (22.3 mm Tris, 22.2 mm borate, 0.5 mmEDTA). The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. IFNγ and TNFα have been shown to cooperatively regulate transcription of many inflammatory genes (3Barker J.N.W.N. Sarma V. Mitra R.S. Dixit V.M.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the IFNγ-induced transcriptional activation of the IRF-1, ICAM-1, and Mig genes depends upon IFNγ response elements or SBEs in the promoter region of the genes (Fig. 1), which are recognized by STAT1 or STAT1-containing factor(s) (14Sims S.H.

The promoter regions of these IFNγ-inducible genes also contain one or more κB sequence motifs, and their transcriptional activation in response to TNFα is dependent upon activation of κB binding activities (44Voraberger G.

On the basis of these observations, we postulated that IFNγ-induced STAT1 and TNFα-induced NF-κB cooperatively regulate transcription of genes containing both SBE and κB motifs. Analysis of RANTES gene expression was also included, since IFNγ and TNFα can cooperatively induce expression of this chemokine gene, although no SBE has been identified in the promoter (6Marfaing-Koka A.

Serum-starved cultures were stimulated with IFNγ and TNFα either alone or in combination for 3 h prior to isolation of RNA and Northern analysis. While the sensitivity of normal cells to IFNγ or TNFα alone varied with each gene, all four genes were strongly expressed in cells stimulated with both agents (Fig. 2 A). IFNγ and TNFα cooperativity was markedly reduced (>90%) in STAT1-deficient fibroblasts without affecting the sensitivity to TNFα alone (Fig. 2 B). These four responses were not mechanistically identical; the synergistic enhancement of RANTES mRNA expression was blocked in cells co-treated with cycloheximide (CHX), while expression of IRF-1, ICAM-1, and Mig was unaltered (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the synergy between IFNγ and TNFα may involve protein synthesis-dependent and -independent mechanisms, both of which require IFNγ-induced STAT1.Figure 2STAT1 is essential for optimal synergy between IFNγ and TNFα. Serum-starved confluent monolayers of fibroblasts from wild type mice (A) or STAT1-deficient mice (B) were either untreated (UT) or stimulated with IFNγ (100 units/ml) and/or TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 3 h in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (C, CHX; 5 μg/ml) prior to preparation of total RNA and analysis of specific mRNA levels by Northern hybridization as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Five μg of total RNA were analyzed in each lane. Blots were hybridized with the indicated radiolabeled cDNA probes. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) IFNγ-induced transcription of the IRF-1 gene has been shown to depend upon the SBE located in positions −123 to −113 (14Sims S.H.

While the yeast genome represents only a small fraction of the information in today's public sequence databases, the complete, ordered and non-redundant sequence provides an invaluable resource for the detailed analysis of cellular gene function and genome architecture. In terms of throughput, completeness and information content, yeast has always been the lead eukaryotic organism in genomics; it is still the largest genome to be completely sequenced."

LARC functions as a selective chemoattractant for lymphocytes that express a class of receptors specifically binding to LARC with high affinity. To identifiy the receptor for LARC, we examined LARC-induced calcium mobilization in cells stably expressing five CC chemokine receptors (CCR1-CCR5) and five orphan seven-transmembrane receptors. LARC specifically induced calcium flux in K562 cells as well as 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing an orphan receptor GPR-CY4.

By Northern blot analysis, GPR-CY4 mRNA was expressed mainly in speen, lymph nodes, Appendix, and fetal liver among various human tissues. Among various leukocyte subsets, GPR-CY4 mRNA was detected in lymphocytes (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B cells) but not in natural killer cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was strongly up-regulated by IL-2.

The chemokines are grouped into two main subfamilies, CXC and CC, on the basis of the arrangement of the N-terminal two conserved cysteine residues. One amino acid separates the two cysteines in the CXC chemokines while the two cysteines are adjacent in the CC chemokines. Most CXC chemokines are potent neutrophil attractants while most CC chemokines recruit monocytes and also lymphocytes, basophils, and/or eosinophils with variable selectivity.

Recently, we have identified a novel CC chemokine, LARC (liver and activation-regulatedchemokine), and mapped its gene to chromosome 2q33-q37 (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). Expression of LARC mRNA was detected mainly in the liver among various human tissues and also induced in several human cell lines by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. LARC was chemotactic for lymphocytes but not for monocytes. LARC fused with the secreted alkaline phosphatase (LARC-SEAP) bound specifically to lymphocytes with aKd of 0.4 nm. Notably, the binding of LARC-SEAP was competed only by LARC and not by other chemokines so far tested (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). These results indicated the presence of a class of receptors specific for LARC on lymphocytes. In the present study, we have demonstrated that an orpan receptor GPR-CY4 2Deposited by L. L. Lautens, W. Modi, and T. I. Bonner. is the LARC receptor that is selectively expressed on lymphocytes. Human hematopoietic cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). 293/EBNA-1 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Peripheral blood leukocytes were fractionated by surface markers as described previously (25Imai, T., Baba, M., Nishimura, M., Kakizaki, M., Takagi, S., and Yoshie, O. (1997) J. Biol.

In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from venous blood obtained from healthy adult donors using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Monocytes, B cells, and T cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD14, FITC-conjugated anti-CD19, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD3, respectively, and positively selected from PBMC by using MACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch, Germany). CD16+ CD3− and CD56+CD3− cells with appropriate forward and side scatters were sorted on a FACStar Plus (Beckton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) as natural killer (NK) cells. CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were purified from PBMC by negative selection using Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) after incubation with anti-CD16, -CD14, -CD20, and -CD8, or -CD16, -CD14, -CD20, and -CD4, respectively. Granulocytes were obtained from the pellet fraction of Ficoll-Paque gradient by dextran sedimentation and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. The purity of each cell population was always >95% as determined by flow cytometry or by staining with Diff-Quik (Baxter Scientific Products, McGaw Park, IL). Recombinant LARC, TARC, Eotaxin, and MCP-1 were produced by using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (20Kitaura M. Nakajima T. Imai T. Harada S. Combadiere C.

In brief, the LARC cDNA was subcloned into the SEAP(His)6 vector (pDREF-SEAP(His)6-Hyg)(28), making the expression vector pDREF-LARC-SEAP. 293/EBNA-1 cells were transfected with pDREF-LARC-SEAP using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) and cultured for 3–4 days in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The culture supernatants were centrifuged, filtered (0.45 μm), added to 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.02% sodium azide, and stored at 4 °C.

Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). In brief, the expression plasmids based on pDREF-Hyg (29Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar) were transfected into Raji cells by electroporation and into 293/EBNA-1 cells by LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After selection with 250 μg/ml hygromycin for 1 to 2 weeks, drug-resistant cells were pooled and used for experiments. K562 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids based on pCAGG-Neo (25Imai, T., Baba, M., Nishimura, M., Kakizaki, M., Takagi, S., and Yoshie, O. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar) by electroporation. After selection with 800μg/ml G418 for 1–2 weeks, clones expressing transfected receptors at high levels were selected by binding assays and/or Northern blot analysis. This was carried out as described previously (25Imai, T., Baba, M., Nishimura, M., Kakizaki, M., Takagi, S., and Yoshie, O. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar). In brief, cells were suspended at 3 × 106 cells/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, (HBSS-BSA) and incubated with 1 μmfura-PE3-AM (Texas Fluorescence Labs) at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After washing twice with HBSS-BSA, cells were suspended in HBSS-BSA at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. 2 ml of the cell suspension in a quartz cuvette was placed in a luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer LS 50B) and fluorescence was monitored at 340 nm (λex1), 380 nm (λex2) and 510 nm (λem) every 200 ms. To determine EC50, a dose-response curve was generated in each experiment by plotting data as percent maximum response. Cell migration was determined by using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber as described previously (29Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar). In brief, each chemo-attractant was diluted in Hepes-buffered RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% BSA and placed in lower wells (25 μl/well). Cells suspended in RPMI 1640 with 1% BSA at 2 × 106cells/ml were placed in upper wells (50 μl/well). Upper and lower wells were separated by a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores precoated with type IV collagen. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 4 h in 5% CO2, 95% air. Filters were removed, washed, and stained with Diff-Quik. Migrated cells were counted in five randomly selected high-power fields (400 ×) per well. All determinations were done in triplicate. This was carried out as described previously (25Imai, T., Baba, M., Nishimura, M., Kakizaki, M., Takagi, S., and Yoshie, O. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. , 272, in press.Google Scholar, 28Hieshima K. Imai T.

In brief, for displacement experiments, 2 × 105 cells were incubated for 1 h at 16 °C with 1 nm of SEAP(His)6 or LARC-SEAP(His)6in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.02% sodium azide. For saturation experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at 16 °C with increasing concentrations of LARC-SEAP(His)6 in the presence or absence of 1 μm unlabeled LARC. After incubation, cells were washed five times and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1% Triton X-100. Samples were heated at 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatase. After brief centrifugation to remove cell debris, alkaline phosphatase activity in 10 μl of lysate was measured by chemiluminescent assay as described previously (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G.

The binding data were analyzed by the LIGAND program (34Munson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). This was carried out as described previously (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar, 29Imai T. Yoshida T. Baba M. Nishimura M. Kakizaki M. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21514-21521Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was prepared by using Trizol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.66 mformaldehyde, blotted onto a filter membrane (Hybond N+) (Amersham Japan, Tokyo). Multiple tissue Northern blots and immune blots were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Hybridization was carried out with probes labeled with 32P using Prime It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolle, CA) at 65 °C in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene). After washing at 55 °C with 0.2 × SSC and 0.1% SDS, filters were exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. To examine interaction of LARC with each cloned receptor, we measured LARC-induced calcium mobilization in a panel of K562 cells stably expressing the five known CCRs (CCR1-CCR5) and five orphan chemokine receptors, V28/CMKBRL1 (31Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Google Scholar, 32Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Google Scholar), EBI1 (33Dobner T. Wolf I. Emrich T. Lipp M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Google Scholar), BLR1 (34Munson P. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar), GPR-CY42(GenBankTM accession number U45984), and GPR-9–6 3Deposited by L. L. Lautens, H. L. Tiffany, J.-L. Gao, W. Modi, P. M. Murphy, and T. I. Bonner. (GenBankTM accession number U45982). As shown in Fig. 1 A, LARC specifically induced calcium flux in K562 cells expressing GPR-CY4 with complete desensitization against a rapid successive treatment with LARC. LARC did not induce calcium flux in parental K562 cells or those expressing CCR1, CCR2B, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, or four other orphan receptors. On the other hand, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, MCP-1, eotaxin, or TARC did not induce calcium flux in K562 cells expressing GPR-CY4 (not shown). These chemokines, however, properly induced calcium flux in K562 cells expressing their respective CCRs even after treatment with LARC (Fig. 1 A). Similar results were obtained by using a panel of 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing these cloned receptors (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing GPR-CY4 responded to LARC in calcium mobilization with an EC50 of ∼50 nm. These results clearly demonstrated that LARC was a specific functional ligand for GPR-CY4. Previously, we showed that LARC induced chemotaxis in freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes with a maximal effect at 1 μg/ml (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether LARC was capable of inducing migration of 293/EBNA-1 cells stably expressing GPR-CY4. As shown in Fig.2 A, LARC induced migration in cells stably expressing GPR-CY4 with a typical bi-modal dose-response curve with a maximum effect at 1 μg/ml and an EC50 of ∼100 ng/ml (∼12 nm). LARC did not induce migration in cells transfected with the vector alone. A checkerboard-type analysis revealed that the migration of GPR-CY4-transfected 293/EBNA-1 cells toward LARC was mostly chemotactic (Fig. 2 B). Previously, we showed that LARC-SEAP(His)6 specifically bound to a single class of receptors expressed on lymphocytes with a Kd of 0.4 nm (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). Importantly, the binding of LARC-SEAP(His)6 was competed only by LARC and not by any other chemokines so far tested, indicating that the LARC receptor is not shared by other chemokines (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). We therefore examined the binding of LARC-SEAP(His)6 to a panel of Raji cells stably expressing GPR-CY4 and other cloned receptors. LARC-SEAP(His)6 bound specifically to cells expressing GPR-CY4 but not to parental cells or those expressing five CCRs or four other orphan receptors (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 A, the binding of LARC-SEAP(His)6 to GPR-CY4 was saturable when increasing concentrations of LARC-SEAP(His)6 were incubated with Raji cells expressing GPR-CY4. The Scatchard analysis revealed aKd of 0.9 nm and 28,800 sites/cell (Fig.3 B). Unlabeled LARC fully competed with LARC-SEAP(His)6 for GPR-CY4 with an IC50 of 3.4 nm (Fig. 3 C). Furthermore, no other CC chemokines, MCP-1, RANTES, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or TARC, were capable of competing with LARC-SEAP(His)6 for GPR-CY4 (Fig.3 D). These binding characteristics were highly consistent with those obtained from the endogenous class of LARC receptors expressed on lymphocytes (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). We have shown that the endogenous class of LARC receptors is expressed selectively on lymphocytes (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression pattern of GPR-CY4 in various human tissues and leukocyte subsets by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). When blots for various tissues were hybridized with the 32P-labeled GPR-CY4 cDNA probe (Fig. 4 A), GPR-CY4 mRNA was found to be expressed strongly in the spleen and weakly in the lymph nodes. Weak expression was also detected in the testis (larger transcripts), small intestine, and PBL. Notably, the mRNA expression was very low, if any, in the liver where the LARC transcripts were mainly detected (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar). When blots specific for various lymphoid tissues were probed, GPR-CY4 mRNA was detected strongly in the spleen, lymph nodes, and Appendix, and weakly in the fetal liver (Fig. 4 B). When the same lymphoid tissue blots were rehybridized with the32P-labeled LARC cDNA probe, LARC mRNA was detected moderately in the appendix and weakly in the lymph nodes, PBL, and fetal liver (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the constitutive expression of GPR-CY4 and that of LARC overlap partly in the secondary lymphoid tissues. We then examined the expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in various leukocyte subsets. T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+T cells) and B cells were clearly positive, whereas NK cells, monocytes, or granulocytes were virtually negative even though some RNA loading differences were noted (Fig. 5 A). We also examined the expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in various human hematopoietic cell lines. Only a T cell line, Hut102, weakly expressed GPR-CY4, whereas other T cell lines (Molt-4, Jurkat, and Hut78), monocytic cell lines (THP-1 and U937), B cell lines (Raji and Daudi), an erythroleukemia cell line (K562), a promyelocytic cell line (HL-60), a basophilic cell line (KU812), and a megakaryocytic cell line (MEG-1) were virtually negative (not shown). Collectively, the expression of GPR-CY4 is mostly limited in the secondary lymphoid tissues and also in T and B lymphocytes. The expression pattern of GPR-CY4 is thus highly consistent to the lymphocyte-selective expression of the endogenous LARC receptor described previously (28Hieshima K. Imai T. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Kusuda J. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5846-5853Google Scholar).Figure 5Selective expression of GPR-CY4 mRNA in lymphocytes.

Syndecans bind and modify the action of various growth factors/cytokines, proteases/antiproteases, cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components. Syndecan expression is highly regulated during wound repair, a process orchestrated by many of these effectors. Each syndecan ectodomain is shed constitutively by cultured cells, but the mechanism and significance of this shedding are not understood. Therefore, we examined (i) whether physiological agents active during wound repair influence syndecan shedding, and (ii) whether wound fluids contain shed syndecan ectodomains.Using SVEC4–10 endothelial cells we find that certain proteases and growth factors accelerate shedding of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains. Protease-accelerated shedding is completely inhibited by serum-containing media. Thrombin activity is duplicated by the 14-amino acid thrombin receptor agonist peptide that directly activates the thrombin receptor and is not inhibited by serum. Epidermal growth factor family members accelerate shedding but FGF-2, platelet-derived growth factor-AB, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor-α, and vascular endothelial cell growth factor 165 do not. Shed ectodomains are soluble, stable in the conditioned medium, have the same size core proteins regardless whether shed at a basal rate, or accelerated by thrombin or epidermal growth factor-family members and are found in acute human dermal wound fluids. Thus, shedding is accelerated by activation of at least two distinct receptor classes, G protein-coupled (thrombin) and protein tyrosine kinase (epidermal growth factor). Proteases and growth factors active during wound repair can accelerate syndecan shedding from cell surfaces.

These are derived from the blood plasma, immigrant cells from the circulation and resident cells at the wound site, and include proteases, antiproteases, growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines (1Bourin M.C.

Much of the heparan sulfate at the cell surface is derived from the syndecan family of transmembrane proteoglycans. These four gene products consist of single polypeptides which comprise at their COOH termini a short cytoplasmic domain (28–34 amino acids) containing three invariant tyrosines, and at their NH2 termini an extracellular domain (ectodomain) that places heparan sulfate chains distal from the plasma membrane. The syndecans bind a variety of growth factors, cytokines, proteases, antiproteases, and cell adhesion molecules (5Jalkanen M. Jalkanen S. Bernfield M. Mecham R.P. McDonald J.A.

Following skin wounds in mice, the keratinocytes at the leading edge migrating into the wound show a loss of cell surface syndecan-1. Concomitantly, syndecan-1 expression increases on the endothelial cells and syndecan-4 expression increases on the dermal fibroblasts that comprise the forming granulation tissue (11Elenius K.

While syndecan expression can be regulated at or following transcription, depending on the cell type or pathophysiological situation, the precise mechanism(s) underlying these changes is unknown (11Elenius K.

A diverse group of transmembrane proteins is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of their ectodomains which are then released into the surrounding milieu (18Ehlers M.R. Riordan J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10065-10074Google Scholar, 19Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Google Scholar, 20Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem.

A. 1993; 90: 3889-3893Google Scholar). This shedding can result in solubilization of the functional domains of the cell surface proteins. Recently, this shedding has been shown to be a highly regulated process and a common system has been proposed for regulating the shedding of several transmembrane proteins released by the action of calcium ionophores or protein kinase C activators such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (22Pandiella A.

Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Google Scholar) and that this shedding involves release of the soluble ectodomain (26Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar). Indeed, each of the syndecan family members is shed (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Google Scholar) and the site of cleavage has been suggested to be a dibasic sequence (syndecan-1, -2, -3) or a basic residue (syndecan-4) adjacent to the plasma membrane (6Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-398Google Scholar, 25Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Google Scholar). We have recently found that features of syndecan shedding are similar to those of the common system proposed to be responsible for shedding of several membrane-anchored growth factors, growth factor receptors, cell adhesion, and other membrane proteins. As with the common system, syndecan-1 and -4 are shed at basal levels, but this shedding is accelerated within minutes of treating cells with PMA (27Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar).Drosophila syndecan lacks basic residues adjacent to the plasma membrane, yet is readily shed from cultured cells (28Spring J. Paine-Saunders S.E. Hynes R.O. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3334-3338Google Scholar). Thus, as with cleavage by the common system, the amino acid sequence may not be of primary importance to the cleavage process. Finally, the apparent loss of cell surface syndecan-1 during wound repair, a process involving various proteases and growth factors, recalled the findings that receptor stimulation can activate the common shedding system (29Roark E.F. Paradies N.E. Lagunowich L.A. Grunwald G.B. Development. 1992; 114: 973-984Google Scholar, 30Cabrera N. Diaz-Rodriguez E. Becker E. Martin-Zanca D. Pandiella A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 427-436Google Scholar, 31Levine S.L. Logun C. Chopra D.P. Rhim J.S. Shelhamner J.H. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 254-261Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether (i) agents that are active during acute wound repair influence syndecan shedding and (ii) dermal wound fluids contain shed syndecans. We find that plasmin, thrombin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) family members accelerate the shedding of the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains from cultured endothelial cell surfaces, that activation of at least two distinct receptor classes (G protein-coupled and protein tyrosine kinase) accelerates shedding, and that the syndecan -1 and -4 ectodomains are in acute human dermal wound fluids. Regulated shedding of the syndecans suggests a physiological role for the soluble proteoglycan ectodomains. Recombinant human (rHu) HB-EGF was obtained from Dr. J. Abraham (Scios-Nova, Mountain View, CA); rHu EGF, TGF-α, and FGF-2 from Intergen (Purchase, NY); rHu platelet derived growth factor AB from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); rHu vascular endothelial cell growth factor 165 from Dr. G. Neufeld (Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel); rHu TNF-α and porcine platelet TGF-β1 from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Plasmin (human plasma), thrombin (human plasma), thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRAP), soybean trypsin inhibitor, and genistein were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Tyrphostin 25 and methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate were from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada). Urokinase-type plasminogen activator, PMA, and TPCK-treated trypsin were from Sigma. Heparan sulfate lyase (heparatinase, EC 4.2.2.8) and chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (chondroitinase ABC, EC 4.2.2.4) were from Seikagaku America Inc. (Rockville, MD). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA) or Amersham Life Sciences. Antibodies specific to syndecan ectodomains included monoclonal antibodies 281-2 against the mouse syndecan-1 ectodomain (32Jalkanen M. Nguyen H. Rapraeger A. Kurn N. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 976-984Google Scholar), 5G9 and 8C7 against the syndecan-4 ectodomain (12Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Google Scholar), polyclonal antisera MSE-2, MSE-3, and MSE-4, against their respective recombinant mouse syndecan ectodomains (7Kim C.W. Goldberger O.A. Gallo R.L. Bernfield M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 797-805Google Scholar) and polyclonal antisera HSE-1, against the recombinant human syndecan-1 ectodomain (12Gallo R. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Google Scholar). Serum antibodies prepared against the syndecan-1 and -4 cytoplasmic domains, which are identical in sequence across species, detect both mouse and human syndecan-1 and -4, respectively. Polyclonal antisera S7C, against a 7-amino acid synthetic peptide (KQEEFYA) corresponding to the COOH terminus of syndecan-1, has been described (26Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain were prepared against a 13-amino acid peptide (LGKKPIYKKAPTN) unique to the syndecan-4 cytoplasmic domain. The immunogen was synthesized using the multiple antigen peptide system and used for immunization and boosts of rabbits at Quality Controlled Biochemicals Inc. (Hopkinton, MA). The antisera was called SCD-4 for syndecan cytoplasmic domain followed by the number corresponding to the specific syndecan family member. Specificity of SCD-4 was determined by immunoprecipitation of [35S]S04-labeled SVEC4–10 cell lysates prepared in RIPA buffer (RIPA: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with antisera specific for each of the four syndecan ectodomains (281–2, MSE-2, MSE-3, and MSE-4). Each antigen-antibody complex contained radioactivity, indicating that these cells express all four syndecans. The complexes were eluted from protein A beads by boiling in 1:1 (v/v) of 2% SDS in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, the eluate was diluted to 0.1% SDS with RIPA buffer without SDS and equal portions were re-immunoprecipitated with SCD-4 sera and preimmune sera as a control. [35S]S04 counts in the resulting immune complexes were found only in the complex obtained with MSE-4. Thus, SCD-4 is selective for the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4. The shed form of syndecan-1 and -4 was partially purified from the conditioned media (CM) of confluent cells cultured for 3 days by QAE-Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia) and cesium chloride density gradient separation similar to the method of Rapraeger and Bernfield (33Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Google Scholar). One μl of this partially purified CM represents the amount of heparan sulfate proteoglycan purified from 1 ml of SVEC4–10 CM. The native transmembrane form of syndecan-1 and -4 was prepared from a RIPA lysate of confluent cells in a 75-cm2 flask (Falcon). The lysate was partially purified on a DEAE-Sephacel column, precipitated with 95% ethanol containing 1.3% potassium acetate, and dissolved in deionized water. Five hundred μl of this partially purified lysate represents the amount of heparin sulfate proteoglycan in the lysate collected from 2.5 × 107 cells. Acute human dermal wound fluids were obtained and treated essentially as described by Grinnellet al. (34Grinnell F. Ho C. Wysocki A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 410-416Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Wysocki et al. (35Wysocki A.B. Staiano-Coico L. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 64-68Google Scholar). Briefly, wound fluid was collected at 1-day intervals for three consecutive days from sterile closed-suction drains routinely placed in the subcutaneous space following mammoplasty. Fluids were centrifuged at 200 ×g for 15 min to pellet cells and debri, and further clarified at 3300 × g and stored frozen (−70 °C). Wound fluids were kindly provided by Dr. E. Eriksson, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA. The use of this anonymous discarded material was approved by the Human Research Committee of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, protocol number 92–5416-01. Blood plasma was collected from human blood diluted 1:1 (v/v) with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 37 °C following separation of cellular components on a Ficoll (Histopaque 1083, Sigma) gradient by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 30 min at room temperature and stored frozen (−70 °C). SVEC4–10 cells were cultured in 96-well and 6-well tissue culture plates (Costar or Falcon) for 16 and 8 h assays, respectively. Cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose at 4.5 g/liter (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Intergen, Purchase, NY) and l-glutamine. At the time of treatment, culture media was replaced with fresh media containing the indicated amounts of FCS and test agents. Following incubation for the indicated times, cells were examined by phase microscopy for survival and morphology and the conditioned media harvested for dot blot analysis. Cells in 96-well plates were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (in Hepes-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mmMgCl2), washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and extracted with 0.1 n NaOH or 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Protein was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The 96-well plate (16 h) assays were performed in triplicate with 100 μl of media per well. The 6-well plate (8 h) assays yielded 600 μl of media per well, which was divided into three equal portions for dot blot analysis. All assays were performed at least three times. Trypsinization of cell surface syndecans from SVEC4–10 cell monolayers in 6-well plates was performed essentially as described (25Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Google Scholar). Briefly, following harvesting of the conditioned media (600 μl), cell layers were washed twice with ice-cold 0.5 mm EDTA-TBS and incubated with 600 μl of 10 μg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin in the same buffer for 10 min on ice. After incubation, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to 50 μg/ml, cells were counted with a hemocytometer and centrifuged (200 ×g) for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing the ectodomains were used immediately or stored at 4 °C for protein determination and dot immunoassay. Total RNA was extracted from pellets as described below. SVEC4–10 cell conditioned media, lysates, and trypsinates, and human dermal wound fluids were diluted in Buffer A (0.15 m NaCl buffered to pH 4.5 with 50 mmNaOAc, with 0.1% Triton X-100), and applied to cationic polyvinylidene difluoride-based membranes (Immobilon-N, Millipore, Bedford, MA) under mild vacuum in an immunodot apparatus (V&P Scientific, San Diego, CA). The membranes were washed twice with Buffer A, and then blocked by a 1-h incubation in Blotto (3% Carnation instant nonfat dry milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.15 m NaCl in 10 mmTris, pH 7.4). Membranes were incubated with the indicated concentration of primary antibody specific for a syndecan ectodomain or cytoplasmic domain, washed in TBS containing 0.3% Tween 20, and incubated with a 5000-fold dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary. All antibodies were diluted in Blotto with 0.3% Tween 20. Detection was by the ECL system (Amersham) as described by the manufacturer, and quantitation was by laser densitometry using the LKB UltroScan XL densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) running the GelScan XL software package (Pharmacia). Assay specificity was confirmed by eluting the membranes containing conditioned media by boiling in 2% SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The only immunoreactive materials detected on Western blots were the respective proteoglycans. Assay quantitation was provided by including known standard amounts of the purified soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain (25Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Google Scholar) on each dot blot as an internal control. These showed a linear increase of absorbance units (AU) between 0.2 and 3.2 ng of syndecan-1. Standard amounts of SVEC4–10 cell conditioned media (day 3) were used as an internal control for the shed syndecan-4 ectodomain, and these also showed a linear increase of AU. In each case experimental values for dot blot quantitation were within these linear ranges. AU varied between experiments, in part, because of differences in exposure times and, in part, because of differences in treatment parameters. Thus, absorbance units were not compared between experiments. Results are expressed as the amount of syndecan shed in AU; for 16 h assays the values are normalized for micrograms of cellular protein. Each point represents the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Statistical significance was calculated using the Student's t test with the Instat biostatistic program. SVEC4–10 cells at confluence in 150-mm plates (Falcon, Lincoln Park, NJ) were incubated in 12 ml of serum-free medium for 16 h. Proteoglycans in the conditioned medium were precipitated twice with 95% ethanol containing 3% potassium acetate and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Half of each sample was incubated with 10 milliunits/ml heparan sulfate lyase and 25 milliunits/ml chondroitin sulfate lyase ABC (Seikagaku America Inc., Rockville, MD) for 2 h at 37 °C. Enzyme-treated samples (0.5 and 2.5 ml of conditioned media equivalent for syndecan-1 and -4, respectively) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (3.5–20% gradient gel) with a discontinuous buffer system (69Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and electrotransferred to Immobilon-N. The membrane was processed as for the dot immunoassay; syndecan-1 and -4 core proteins were detected using mAb 281-2 and antisera MSE-4, respectively, followed by ECL detection. Wound fluid (day 1 and 3) was immunoprecipitated using antiserum against the human syndecan-1 ectodomain (HSE-1), or a mixture of mAbs against the human syndecan-4 ectodomain (5G9 and 8C7). The protein A immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE (3.5–20% gradient gel) and electrotransferred to Immobilon-N. A431 human squamous cell carcinoma cell conditioned media (day 3), partially purified by QAE-Sephadex A-25 (Pharmacia) and cesium chloride density gradient separation (33Rapraeger A. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4103-4109Google Scholar), was run as a control. Syndecan-1 and -4 were detected by ECL using HSE-1 or mAbs 5G9 and 8C7, respectively. Total RNA was extracted from approximately 1 × 106 cells by resuspension in guanidinium denaturation solution, phenol/chloroform extraction, and isopropyl alcohol precipitation as described in the Ambion Totally RNA isolation kit (Austin, TX). RNA was separated in a 1% agarose, 0.6% formaldehyde gel, transferred to Nytran membranes using the Turboblotter (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.), and UV cross-linked. Membranes were prehybridized and hybridized in QuikHyb (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at 68 °C for 2 h with 1–2 × 106cpm/ml of a BamHI-EcoRI fragment of the mouse syndecan-1 cDNA (26Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar). Blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS followed by two washes at 65 °C in 0.2 × SSPE with 0.5% SDS and exposed to film (X-Omat AR; Eastman Kodak) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The membranes were rehybridized with a 32P-labeled 800-base pairPstI fragment of the mouse β-actin probe provided by Dr. Stella Kourembanas (Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA) to quantitate the relative amount of RNA per lane. Results were quantified by densitometric scanning (Hewlett Packard Scan Jet IIC) using area measurements from NIH Image, version 1.57. We assessed whether agents known to be involved in wound repair regulate the shedding of syndecan ectodomains from the cell surface. SVEC4–10 cells, a mouse SV40 transformed endothelial cell line, were used as a test cell line (36O'Connell K.A. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 521-525Google Scholar). These cells were chosen because they remain viable in the presence or absence of serum, express both syndecan-1 and -4, and shed the ectodomains of these syndecans at a low basal rate. Shedding was assayed by measuring the appearance in the culture media of immunoreactive syndecan ectodomains. Shed proteoglycans are not endocytosed by these cells during a 16-h incubation and thus are stable within the conditioned medium (data not shown). NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells were previously shown to shed the syndecan-1 ectodomain by demonstrating that the material in conditioned media (i) migrated as a GAG-free core protein at the sameMr as the trypsin-released ectodomain (25Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Google Scholar) but smaller than the transmembrane proteoglycan (37Rapraeger A. Jalkanen M. Bernfield M. Wight R.N. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix, Biology of Proteoglycans. Mercel Dekker, Inc., Academic Press, New York1987: 129-154Google Scholar), and (ii) failed to react with an antibody directed against the cytoplasmic domain (26Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar). We confirmed these results for syndecan-1 and -4 shed into conditioned media by SVEC4–10 cells in the presence or absence of serum. Proteoglycans in conditioned media and RIPA cell lysates were partially purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” treated with lyases to remove GAG chains, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to cationic polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. As expected, the glycosaminoglycan-free core proteins derived from the conditioned media were smaller than those from lysates (data not shown). The proteoglycans were immobilized on cationic membranes and probed with core protein-specific antibodies directed against the ectodomains and the cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1). Antibodies against the syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains detected these proteoglycans in cell lysates and conditioned media, as expected. Antibodies against the cytoplasmic domains detected proteoglycans in the cell lysates, but failed to detect proteoglycans in conditioned media, indicating that these are the ectodomains. We first examined the effect of various agents on syndecan shedding by SVEC4–10 cells during a 16-h incubation in the presence and absence of 5% fetal calf serum. Basal shedding of syndecan-1 and -4 was barely detectable, but shedding was markedly increased by PMA treatment (Fig.2), as described previously (27Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Google Scholar). Both EGF and HB-EGF (10 ng/ml) accelerated shedding, however, vascular endothelial cell growth factor 165, FGF-2, platelet-derived growth factor AB, TGFβ, and TNFα (10 ng/"

The domains of these proteins that mediate their various interactions have not been entirely defined. HP1-type proteins are predicted by hydrophobic cluster analysis to consist of two homologous but distinct globular domains, corresponding to the chromodomain and chromo shadow domain, separated by a hinge region. We show here that the chromo shadow domain mediates the self-associations of HP1-type proteins and is also necessary for binding to LBR both in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Hydrophobic cluster analysis also predicts that the nucleoplasmic amino-terminal portion of LBR contains two globular domains separated by a hinge region. The interactions of the LBR domains with an HP1-type protein were also analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding assays, which showed that a portion of the second globular domain is necessary for binding. The modular domain organization of HP1-type proteins and LBR can explain some of the diverse protein-protein interactions at the chromatin-lamina-membrane interface of the nuclear envelope.

HP1 is a heterochromatin protein originally identified inDrosophila melanogaster, where it functions as a suppressor of position effect variegation (1James T.C. Elgin S.C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3862-3872Google Scholar, 2Eissenberg J.C. James T.C. Foster-Hartnett D.M. Hartnett T. Ngan V. Elgin S.C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9923-9927Google Scholar). HP1 and homologous proteins in other species are included in the chromo superfamily of proteins (3Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3173Google Scholar,4Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Google Scholar). The identifying feature of this superfamily is the chromodomain, which was first shown to be common to HP1 and Polycomb, aDrosophila protein involved in the down-regulation of homeotic selector genes during development (5Paro R. Hogness D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 85: 263-267Google Scholar). HP1-type proteins, which are included in Class A of the chromo superfamily, contain a second domain, homologous to but distinct from the chromodomain, which has been termed the chromo shadow domain (3Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3173Google Scholar).In contrast to Drosophila, the functions of the highly conserved mammalian HP1-type proteins remain mostly unknown. In humans, three HP1-type proteins that arise from different genes, termed HP1Hsα, HP1Hsβ, and HP1Hsγ, have been described (6Singh P.B. Miller J.R. Pearce J. Kothary R. Burton R.D. Paro R. James T.C. Gaunt S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 789-794Google Scholar, 7Saunders W.S. Chue C. Goebl M. Craig C. Clark R.F. Powers J.A. Eissenberg J.C. Elgin S.C.R. Earnshaw W.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 573-582Google Scholar, 8Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotic cells, a portion of the transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin is associated with the nuclear envelope (9Mathog D. Hochstrasser M. Gruenbaum Y. Saumweber H. Sedat J. Nature. 1984; 308: 414-421Google Scholar, 10Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8527-8529Google Scholar), and we have demonstrated that human HP1-type proteins bind to the inner nuclear membrane protein LBR (8Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Google Scholar). LBR (lamin Breceptor), which also binds to B-type lamins, has a nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain of ∼210 amino acids and a hydrophobic domain with eight putative transmembrane segments (11Worman H.J. Yuan J. Blobel G. Georgatos S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8531-8534Google Scholar, 12Worman H.J. Evans C.D. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1535-1542Google Scholar, 13Ye Q.

Besides possibly playing a role in the attachment of the nuclear lamina and the heterochromatin to the nuclear envelope in interphase, LBR may also function in targeting inner nuclear membrane vesicles to chromatin at the end of mitosis (15Chaudhary N. Courvalin J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 295-306Google Scholar, 16Collas P. Courvalin J.-C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Google Scholar). Mouse HP1-type polypeptides have also been shown to bind to the transcriptional coactivators TIF1α and TIF1β (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Google Scholar). TIF transcriptional coactivators interact with the ligand-binding domains of retinoic acid and other nuclear receptors and may mediate their activation functions (18Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar). In the yeast two-hybrid assay, mouse HP1-type proteins have also been shown to self-associate (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Google Scholar).The structure of HP1-type proteins suggests that different domains may mediate their different interactions. In this study, we have used hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) 1The abbreviations used are:HCAhydrophobic cluster analysis;PAGEpolyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis;GSTglutathione S-transferase. (19Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Google Scholar, 20Woodcock S. Mornon J.-P. Henrissat B.

Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 555-574Google Scholar) to predict the secondary structures of human HP1-type proteins and LBR. We then used the structural information obtained by using HCA to identify the domains of these proteins that mediate some of their protein-protein interactions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Sequence Analysis Using HCAGuidelines for the use of this method have been published previously (19Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Google Scholar, 20Woodcock S. Mornon J.-P. Henrissat B. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 629-635Google Scholar, 21Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.-P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 555-574Google Scholar). HCA allows comparisons not only of amino acid sequences, but also the protein secondary structures statistically centered on hydrophobic clusters and their distributions (20Woodcock S. Mornon J.-P.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar).For sequence alignments, the accuracy was assessed by computing identity, similarity, and HCA scores as well as the corresponding Z-scores (27Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar). Z-scores represent the differences between the alignment score under consideration and the mean score of a distribution computed from the alignment of sequence 1 versus a large number of randomly shuffled versions of sequence 2. Differences are then expressed relative to the standard deviation of the random distribution. Scores that are 3.0 standard deviations or greater above the scrambled mean suggest authentic relationships (27Callebaut I. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar).Plasmid ConstructionComplementary DNAs were generated by the polymerase chain reaction (28Sakai R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1987; 239: 487-491Google Scholar) using the Gene Amp kit (Hoffmann-La Roche) and a PCR System 2400 thermocycler (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). To amplify DNA sequences, custom oligonucleotide primers (DNAgency, Malvern, PA) designed with restriction endonuclease sites at their 5′-ends were used with clones for human LBR (13Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11306-11311Google Scholar) and HP1Hsα (8Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Google Scholar) as templates. Amplified cDNAs were purified and cloned into the plasmids of choice by standard methods.As our previously characterized cDNA clone for HP1Hsγwas lacking the first 17 putative amino acids based on sequence homology to other HP1-type proteins (8Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Google Scholar), we generated a full-length clone by performing the polymerase chain reaction with HeLa cell cDNA from a plasmid library (CLONTECH) as template. Oligonucleotide primers (DNAgency) based on the 3′-sequence of the partial HP1Hsγ cDNA clone (GenBank™ accession number U26312) and a putative 5′-sequence in GenBank™ (accession number Z15820) were used in the reaction. The amplified cDNA was cloned into plasmid pACT2 (CLONTECH) and sequenced (the entry with GenBank™ accession number U26313 has been updated to reflect the complete cDNA sequence of HP1Hsγ). This full-length HP1Hsγ cDNA clone was used as a template for the polymerase chain reaction to generate HP1Hsγ cDNAs for cloning as described above.Binding Assays Using in Vitro Translated ProteinsForin vitro transcription-translation, cDNAs were cloned into pBFT4 (supplied by J. Licht, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York). Proteins expressed using this plasmid contained a FLAG epitope at their amino termini. In vitro translation was performed using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp). SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography was performed to confirm the synthesis of proteins. In binding experiments, 20 μl of in vitro translation lysate were added to 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmNaHepes (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) coupled to 3–5 μg of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Plasmids that expressed GST fusion proteins were constructed by cloning the desired cDNA into pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (30Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Suspensions containing lysates and GST fusion proteins were incubated at 4 °C with rotation for ∼2 h. After incubation, glutathione-Sepharose was washed five times with binding buffer, and bound proteins were then eluted with 4% SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography.Yeast Two-hybrid AssayTo generate plasmids for use in the yeast two-hybrid assay, cDNAs were cloned into pACT2, which expresses fusion proteins with the GAL4 transcription activation domain, or pGBT9 (provided by S. Fields, University of Washington, Seattle), which expresses fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The desired plasmids were cotransformed intoSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 (provided by S. J. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). The two-hybrid assay and measurement of β-galactosidase activity were performed as described previously (31Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Google Scholar, 32Ye Q. Worman H.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 292-298Google Scholar).RESULTSHCA of Human HP1-type Protein SequencesWe have used HCA to analyze the sequences of human HP1Hsα, HP1Hsβ, and HP1Hsγ. This method is highly effective in detecting three-dimensional similarities between proteins with limited sequence identities (typically 10–30%), primarily by its ability to detect related secondary structure elements statistically centered on hydrophobic clusters. Similar HCA plots for two sequences are therefore indicative of putative three-dimensional relationships. HCA of human HP1Hsα revealed two globular domains separated by a hinge region of ∼70 amino acids (Fig.1). Similar results were obtained for HP1Hsβ and HP1Hsγ (data not shown). The first of the two globular domains in the HP1 polypeptides was originally identified by Paro and Hogness (5Paro R. Hogness D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 85: 263-267Google Scholar) as the chromodomain common to the Drosophila proteins Polycomb and HP1. Analysis of the second globular domain of HP1Hsα suggested that it contained a three-dimensional fold similar to the chromodomain, probably as a result of an internal duplication (Fig. 1). The validity of this prediction was assessed by calculation of Z-scores from the comparison of the alignment of the tandemly duplicated domains with 10,000 alignments performed after randomization of one of the compared sequences. The Z-scores allow for evaluation of how the signal emerges from the background, with values exceeding 3.0 expected to represent an authentic relationship. The Z-identity value of 4.75, the Z-similarity value of 6.30, and the Z-HCA score of 4.72 confirm an authentic relationship between the chromodomain and the second globular domain in human HP1Hsα. Similar values were obtained for HP1Hsβ and HP1Hsγ. While this work was in progress, Koonin et al. (4Koonin E.V. Zhou S. Lucchesi J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4229-4233Google Scholar) and Aasland and Stewart (3Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3168-3173Google Scholar), who termed the second globular domain the chromo shadow domain, published similar results obtained using different sequence analysis methods.Self-associations of HP1 ProteinsMouse HP1-type proteins, which are 98–100% identical to their human homologues, self-associate via their chromo shadow domains in the yeast two-hybrid assay (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Google Scholar). We further examined the interactions of HP1Hsα and HP1Hsγ in an in vitro solution binding assay (Fig. 2). 35S-Labeled HP1Hsαproduced by in vitro translation in reticulocyte lysates was precipitated by the GST-HP1Hsα and GST-HP1Hsγ fusion proteins, but not by GST (Fig. 2,lanes 1–4). Similarly, 35S-labeled HP1Hsγ was precipitated by the GST-HP1 fusion proteins, but not by GST (Fig. 2, lanes 5–8). These results show that HP1Hsα and HP1Hsγ can self-associate and associate with each other in vitro.Figure 2HP1Hsα and HP1Hsγself-associate and bind to each other. 35S-Labeled HP1Hsα (lanes 1–4) and HP1Hsγ(lanes 5–8) were synthesized in reticulocyte lysates byin vitro translation and incubated with GST (lanes 2and 6), GST-HP1Hsα (lanes 3and 7), or GST-HP1Hsγ (lanes 4and 8) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Ten percent of the amount of incubated 35S-labeled protein used in each binding reaction is also shown (lanes 1and 5). After washing, the proteins that remained bound to glutathione-Sepharose were eluted with SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography.

GST-HP1Hsα and GST-HP1Hsγ fusion proteins precipitated full-length HP1Hsα (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1and5) from reticulocyte lysates, but not the portion of HP1Hsα that contained the chromodomain plus the hinge region (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2and 6). The GST fusion proteins also bound to the hinge region plus the chromo shadow domain of HP1Hsα (Fig. 3 B,lanes 3and 7) and to the chromo shadow domain alone (Fig.3 B,lanes 4and 8). Hence, the chromo shadow domain was necessary and sufficient for the self-association of HP1Hsα and its binding to HP1Hsγ. These results are consistent with those previously reported using the yeast two-hybrid assay, which showed that the chromo shadow domain of the mouse homologue of HP1Hsα interacted with mouse HP1Hsα and a portion of MOD1, the mouse homologue of HP1Hsγ (17Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.-M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Google Scholar).Figure 3The chromo shadow domain of HP1Hsα mediates its binding to itself and to HP1Hsγ. A, shown is a schematic diagram of HP1Hsα indicating the chromodomain and chromo shadow domain and the positions of amino acids 1, 69, 109, and 191. cDNAs for different domains of HP1Hsα were cloned into pBFT4 to express the polypeptides represented by bars 1–4. The corresponding in vitro translated products of each are shown in the autoradiogram. Migration of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) is indicated on the left.

After washing, the proteins that remained bound to glutathione-Sepharose were eluted with SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Approximately 10–15% of the input material bound specifically to the proteins, which generated positive results.

Full-length HP1Hsα and the hinge region plus the chromo shadow domain interacted with LBR in the two-hybrid assay. The chromo shadow domain alone also gave a positive result. Neither the portion of HP1Hsα that contained the chromodomain plus the hinge region nor the hinge region alone interacted with the amino-terminal domain of LBR. The chromo shadow domain was therefore necessary and sufficient for the interaction of HP1Hsα with LBR in the yeast two-hybrid assay.Figure 4The chromo shadow domain of HP1Hsα is necessary and sufficient for binding to the amino-terminal domain of LBR in the yeast two-hybrid assay.Schematic diagrams of the various HP1Hsα polypeptides (shaded rectangles) fused to the transcription activation domain of GAL4 (white rectangles) used in the two-hybrid assay are shown. The names of the plasmids that encoded each construct are given to the right of each schematic diagram. Plasmid pACT2 expresses the GAL4 transcription activation domain alone and was used as a negative control. These plasmids were cotransformed with pGBT9-LBRAT, which expresses the amino-terminal domain of LBR fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. The panel on the right shows the results of filter assays for β-galactosidase (β-Gal) activity, in which the dark rectanglesindicate detectable β-galactosidase activity. The results of a liquid culture assay to measure β-galactosidase activities are also shown, with the values given as means ± S.E. in arbitrary units (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also examined the binding of various domains of HP1Hsα, synthesized by in vitro translation, to a GST fusion protein of the amino-terminal domain of LBR (Fig.5). 35S-Labeled full-length HP1Hsα and polypeptides containing the chromodomain plus the hinge region, the chromo shadow domain plus the hinge region, and the chromo shadow domain alone were synthesized by in vitrotranslation in reticulocyte lysates. Full-length HP1Hsαwas precipitated by the GST-LBR fusion protein (Fig. 5, lane 1), as was the protein that contained the chromo shadow domain plus the hinge region (lane 3). Deletion of the chromo shadow domain from HP1Hsα abolished its binding to LBR (Fig. 5, lane 2). The chromo shadow domain alone, however, did not associate with LBR in this assay (Fig. 5, lane 4). Hence, the chromo shadow domain was necessary for the binding of HP1Hsα to LBR. In contrast to the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid assay, it was not sufficient and required additional amino acids of the hinge region at its amino-terminal side. These additional amino acids plus the chromodomain did not bind to LBR, suggesting that they alone did not mediate the interaction.Figure 5The chromo shadow domain of HP1Hsα is necessary for its binding to the amino-terminal domain of LBR. 35S-Labeled portions of full-length HP1Hsα (lane 1), HP1Hsα from amino acids 2 to 109 (lane 2), HP1Hsα from amino acids 69 to 191 (lane 3), and HP1Hsαfrom amino acids 104 to 191 (lane 4) were incubated with a GST fusion protein containing the amino-terminal domain of LBR. After washing, the proteins that remained bound to glutathione-Sepharose were eluted with SDS, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Approximately 10% of the input material bound specifically to the proteins, which generated positive results. Migration of molecular mass standards (in kilodaltons) is indicated on the left. A schematic diagram of HP1Hsα showing the chromodomain and chromo shadow domain and the positions of some amino acids, diagrams of the in vitro translated polypeptides, and an autoradiogram showing the translated polypeptides can be found in Fig. 3 A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)HCA of the Sequence of the Nucleoplasmic Domain of LBRWe have previously demonstrated that the nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain of LBR binds to human HP1-type proteins (8Ye Q. Worman H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14653-14656Google Scholar). The sequence of this segment of LBR was analyzed by HCA (Fig. 6). This analysis suggested that the amino-terminal domain of LBR contained two globular domains separated by a hinge region of ∼40 amino acids. The first globular domain of LBR is located between amino acids 1 and 60. The second globular domain is roughly located between amino acids 105 and 210. The hinge region between these two globular domains is highly charged between amino acids 70 and 100. The globular domains of LBR are distinct from the chromodomain and chromo shadow domains in HP1-type proteins.Figure 6General organization of the nucleoplasmic amino-terminal domain of LBR as predicted from the analysis of its HCA plot. HCA detects two globular domains (boxed) separated by a hinge region that is highly charged between amino acids 70 and 100. The first putative transmembrane segment of LBR that follows the nucleoplasmic domain stretches from approximately amino acids 210 to 230 (shaded). Details on the presentation of the data and the symbols used can be found in the legend to Fig.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of the Domain of LBR That Interacts with HP1HsαWe examined the interactions of various portions of the amino-terminal domain of LBR with HP1Hsαin the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 7). Full-length LBR interacted with full-length HP1Hsα in this assay. The first 100 amino acids of LBR that contained the first globular domain detected by HCA plus the hinge region did not interact with HP1Hsα. The portion of LBR from amino acids 97 to 208 that contained the second globular domain interacted with HP1Hsα. LBR from amino acids 1 to 174 also interacted with HP1Hsα, as did the stretch between amino acids 97 and 174, which contained only the first portion of the second globular domain. The region of LBR from amino acids 124 to 208 did not interact with HP1Hsα. These results show that the first portion of the second globular domain identified by HCA in the amino-terminal domain of LBR is responsible for its binding to HP1Hsα in the yeast two-hybrid assay.Figure 7The first part of the second globular domain of LBR binds to HP1Hsα in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Schematic diagrams of the various LBR polypeptides (hatched rectangles) fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (white rectangles) used in the two-hybrid assay are shown. The names of the plasmids that encoded each construct are given to the right of each schematic diagram. Plasmid pGBT9, which expresses the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone, was used as a negative control.

The 35S-labeled LBR amino-terminal domain and several portions were synthesized by in vitrotranslation in reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 8 A). The LBR amino-terminal domain was precipitated by the full-length GST-HP1Hsα fusion protein (Fig. 8 B,lane 1), as was the portion from amino acids 97 to 208 that contained the second globular domain (Fig. 8 B,lane 2). A polypeptide that contained the first globular domain plus the hinge region from amino acids 1 to 100 of LBR was not precipitated from reticulocyte lysates by the HP1Hsα fusion protein (Fig.8 B,lane 3). LBR from amino acids 1 to 174 and from amino acids 97 to 174 (Fig. 8 B,lanes 4and5) were also precipitated from lysates by the HP1Hsα fusion protein, but the region of LBR between amino acids 124 and 208 was not precipitated (Fig. 8 B,lane 6). These findings are consistent with those obtained in the yeast two-hybrid assay and show that the first portion of the second globular domain identified by HCA in the nucleoplasmic domain of LBR mediates its binding to human HP1-type proteins.Figure 8The first part of the second globular domain of LBR binds to HP1Hsα in vitro. A, cDNAs for different domains of LBR were cloned into pBFT4, and the corresponding in vitro translated products of each are shown in the autoradiogram.

https://openalex.org/W2091407868,"Paclitaxel can induce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 gene expression, similar to lipopolysaccharides. Since lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of TNF is related to activation of NF-kappaB, we determined whether NF-kappaB could be activated by paclitaxel. In the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, paclitaxel activated NF-kappaB in a dose-dependent manner with maximal activation after 2-4 h. Since paclitaxel could up-regulate TNF and interleukin-1 secretion and subsequent NF-kappaB activation could be caused by these cytokines, the effect of two other groups of anticancer drugs including vinca alkaloids (vinblastine and vincristine) and anthracyclines (daunomycin and doxorubicin), neither of which induce TNF or interleukin-1 gene expression, were examined. Like paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, daunomycin, and doxorubicin each caused activation of NF-kappaB. Therefore, it is unlikely that activation of NF-kappaB caused by these agents or by paclitaxel is mediated via cytokine up-regulation. Furthermore, actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors of transcription and translation, respectively, did not inhibit paclitaxel-induced NF-kappaB activation. Several other transcription factors such as AP-1, AP-2, CREB, SP-1, or TFIID were not activated by antineoplastic agents demonstrating specificity of NF-kappaB activation. The involvement of both subunits in the NF-kappaB DNA binding complex was demonstrated by its abrogation by anti-p65 and by supershift by anti-p50 antibodies. Since protein phosphorylation is implicated in the activation of NF-kappaB, the effect of anticancer drugs on protein kinase C activity was measured. Vincristine, daunomycin, and paclitaxel significantly increased protein kinase C activity, and vinblastine and doxorubicin caused similar trends. Following treatment with antineoplastics (1-4 h), cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha degradation occurred concomitantly with translocation of p65 to the nucleus. Specific protein kinase C inhibitors (bisindolylmaleimide (GF109203X) and calphostin C) blocked the activation of NF-kappaB by each compound. Hence, protein kinase C activation may contribute to NF-kappaB activation by antineoplastic agents."

Here, we report the cloning from rat, dorsal root ganglia (DRG), cellular expression, and functional analysis of a novel tetrodotoxin-sensitive peripheral sodium channel (PN), PN1.

Furthermore, while the activation of Jak1 and Jak3 are common to the other T cell growth factors, IL-4 (28Witthuhn B.A. Silennioinen O. Miura O. Lai K.S. Cwik C. Liu E. Ihle J.

Blood. 1994; 84: 1579-1586Google Scholar), and IL-9 (31Yin T. Yang L. Yang Y.C. Blood. 1995; 85: 3101-3106Google Scholar), activation of the other IL-2-mediated events, with the exception of the IL-7-induced activation of p56lck (32Page T.H. Lali F.V. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2956-2960Google Scholar), has not been observed. The apparent redundancy of ERK activation in T cell proliferation is in contrast to other cellular systems, where these kinases have been implicated in mitogenic responses to growth factors (33Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Scopus (3210) Google Scholar). This functional link is supported by the transforming potential of the proximal activators of this pathway, i.e. oncogenic Ras (reviewed in Ref. 34Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 50: 779-827Google Scholar) and Raf (35Rapp U.R. Goldsborough M.D. Mark G.E. Bonner T.I. Groffen J. Reynolds F.H.J. Stephenson J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4218-4222Google Scholar) and a constitutively active form of MEK1 (36Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Google Scholar), as well as by studies with dominant-negative and antisense cDNA (37Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.-C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar). The inhibition of fibroblast proliferation by a specific inhibitor of MEK1, PD098059 (38Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Google Scholar), further supports a role for this pathway in proliferation. Recently two other subgroups of the MAP kinase family have been characterized, SAPK/JNK and p38MAP kinase. These kinases respond to a variety of physicochemical stresses (e.g. UV light, translational inhibitors, hyperosmolarity), lipopolysaccharide, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1 (39Kyriakis J.M.

Unlike ERK, these “stress kinases” have not been implicated previously in mitogenesis. The response of these enzymes to IL-2, other T cell growth factors, or other cytokines barring those mentioned above has not been investigated previously, although SAPK/JNK has been shown to be activated in T cells by co-stimulation through CD3 and CD28 (44Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Google Scholar). This study shows that both SAPK/JNK and p38MAP kinase are activated by IL-2. In addition (which is not the case for ERK) they are also activated by IL-7. The inhibition of p38MAP kinase activity by the specific inhibitor SB203580 resulted in suppression of T cell proliferation in response to IL-2 and IL-7, suggesting that rather than being solely involved in stress responses, in T cells at least, p38MAP kinase is required to transduce the mitogenic signal. IL-7 and IL-2 were kindly provided by Dr. C. Faltynek (Sterling Winthrope, Malvern, PA) and Dr. P. Lomedico, (Roche Inc., Nutley, NJ), respectively. Rabbit antisera to SAPK/JNK were raised to the N-terminal peptide sequence, GVVKGQPSPSAQVQQ, and to p38MAP kinase as reported previously (45Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Google Scholar). Antibody to MAPKAP kinase-2 was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), ERK was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA) and c-Myc was generously provided by Dr. G. Evan (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London). The p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 was generously provided by Dr. J. Lee, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (King of Prussia, PA). GST-Jun (2–89) and GST-ATF2 (19–96) were purified by standard techniques. The murine cytokine-dependent T cell line, CT6 (kindly provided by Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was maintained and proliferation assays and Western immunoblotting c-Myc and ERK performed as described previously (14Crawley J.B. Willcocks J. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2717-2733Google Scholar, 46Willcocks J.L. Hales A. Page T.H. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 716-720Google Scholar). Cell viability was assessed by the amount of merocyanine 540 (Sigma) incorporated into the cell membrane of live gated cells (47Mower D.A. Peckham D.W. Illera V.A. Fishbaugh J.K. Stunz L.L. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4832-4842Google Scholar). Human peripheral blood T cell isolation and proliferation were as described previously (48Page T.H. Willcocks J.L. Taylor-Fishwick D.A. Foxwell B.M.J. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4753-4763Google Scholar). SB203580 was added to the cells 15 min prior to the addition of cytokine where indicated. Cells were lysed at approximately 20 × 106/ml in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton T-X100, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysates were centrifuged 12,000 × g for 10 min to precipitate debris. Kinases were immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with constant agitation with specific antibody/protein-G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Milton Keynes, Bucks, UK). Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer prior to Western immunoblotting and a further two times with kinase assay buffer prior to kinase assays (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mmNa3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). In vitro kinase assays for SAPK/JNK were performed on immunoprecipitates resuspended in 50 μl of assay buffer and 30 μl of 0.1 mg/ml GST-ATF2-(19–96) or GST-JUN-(2–89). Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μl of 180 μm ATP containing 0.5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, Bucks, UK). After agitation for 20 min at 25 °C, reactions were terminated by boiling with gel sample buffer. For the in vitro kinase assays for p38MAP kinase, Hsp27 kinase (which is similar, if not identical to MAPKAP kinase-2) and Hsp27 were purified from KB cells, and recombinant Hsp27 was prepared as described previously (41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar). To the immunoprecipitates were added 35 μl of kinase assay buffer, 30 μl of Hsp27 kinase (MAPKAP kinase-2), which had been previously inactivated by treatment with protein phosphatase 2A, and Hsp27 (1.5 μg/track); the reaction was initiated and terminated as for the SAPK/JNK assays. All products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and dried gels were autoradiographed at −70 °C. For the in vitro MAPKAP kinase-2 assays, the activated enzyme was immunoprecipitated from lysates of 5–10 × 106 cell equivalents for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates washed as for the p38MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK assays, resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 30 μm final concentration of Hsp27 peptide (sequence KKLNRTLSVA (49Stokoe D. Caudwell B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 843-849Google Scholar)). Reactions were initiated with 10 μl of 180 μm ATP containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Following 20 min at 25 °C, reactions were terminated by spotting the supernatants onto squares of P81 paper and placing into 0.75% orthophosphoric acid. Following three washes in acid and one in acetone, the squares were subjected to scintillation counting. SAPK/JNK activation was measured by phosphorylation of GST Jun-(2–89) (43Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar) or GST-ATF-2-(19–96) (50Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Google Scholar) as substrates, after immunoprecipitation from human (Kit-225) and murine (CT6) T cells. The enzyme was activated when precipitated from IL-2-treated cells, as compared with that from unstimulated cells (Fig. 1, a andb). Treatment of the responsive CT6 cells with IL-7 also activated this kinase (Fig. 1 b). SAPK/JNK activation was dose-dependent for both cytokines (Fig. 1, c andd) and was maximal at 2 ng/ml (100 pm). This correlates with the proliferative response of CT6 to either cytokine (46Willcocks J.L. Hales A. Page T.H. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 716-720Google Scholar). As expected, activated SAPK/JNK was also immunoprecipitated from T cells stressed with anisomycin (Fig. 1 a) or exposed to TNF-α (Fig. 1 b). No kinase activity was precipitated with non-immune rabbit serum (Fig. 1, a and b), which confirmed the specificity of the assay. Generally, stressful and inflammatory stimuli that activate SAPK/JNK also activate a related enzyme, p38MAP kinase. We therefore investigated whether this second stress kinase would respond to T cell mitogens. The activity of p38MAP kinase immunoprecipitated from CT6 cells was assayed by a kinase cascade involving Hsp27 kinase (which is similar, if not identical to, MAPKAP kinase-2 (51Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Google Scholar)) and its substrate (41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar). A substantial elevation in Hsp27 phosphorylation was observed with p38MAP kinase immunoprecipitates from cytokine-treated cells (Fig. 2 a). Kinetic studies showed maximal activation by IL-7 was delayed when compared with IL-2 (Fig.2 b), although this has not been apparent in all experiments. TNF-α also activated p38MAP kinase as expected, although it should be noted that CT6 cells possess only the p75 TNF receptor (p75 TNFR) (52Ranges G.E. Bombara M.P. Aiyer R.A. Rice G.G. Palladino M.A.J. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1203-1208Google Scholar), while previous studies on the TNF-α response have used cells that also express the p55 TNFR. No kinase activity was precipitated by non-immune rabbit serum (Fig. 2 a). Unlike SAPK/JNK, p38MAP kinase has not been previously shown to be activated in T cells. Preincubation (15 min) of CT6 cells (Fig. 3 a) with the specific p38MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, equally inhibited proliferation induced by either IL-2 or IL-7 (IC50 ∼3 μm). A similar IC50 is observed for inhibition of TNF-α production by monocytes 2L. M. Williams and B. M. J. Foxwell, unpublished observations. and for collagen-induced platelet aggregation (45Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of this inhibitor on primary T cells isolated from human blood (Fig. 3,b and c). These were treated with anti-CD3 and then induced to proliferate to IL-2 and IL-7. SB203580 inhibited the proliferation over a concentration range similar to that observed in the T cell lines. The compound was not toxic at the maximum concentrations used as judged by merocyanine staining in conjunction with fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (47Mower D.A. Peckham D.W. Illera V.A. Fishbaugh J.K. Stunz L.L. Ashman R.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4832-4842Google Scholar) (not shown), nor did it inhibit all responses to the cytokines, since expression of c-Myc induced by IL-2 or IL-7 (14Crawley J.B. Willcocks J. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2717-2733Google Scholar) was unaffected by 10 μm SB203580 (Fig. 3 d). The effect of SB203580 on T cell proliferation led us to question how closely this correlated with inhibition of one known function of p38MAP kinase. MAPKAP kinase-2 is phosphorylated and activated by p38MAP kinase in a number of cell types (41Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar, 51Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Google Scholar), and this is inhibited by SB203580 (53Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar). As expected MAPKAP kinase-2 was activated by IL-2 (Fig. 4 a) in a dose-dependent manner as judged by assays of the enzyme immunoprecipitated from CT6 cells. Activity was maximal at 20 ng/ml IL-2; the proliferative response of the cells displayed a similar dose dependence (not shown). The activation of the enzyme was inhibited by SB203580 (Fig. 4 b) in the concentration range 0.1–1 μm, in agreement with the in vitro inhibition of p38MAP kinase (53Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar) and previous studies on MAPKAP kinase-2 (54Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Google Scholar). There was no MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in control immunoprecipitations with nonspecific antisera (not shown). In contrast, studies of ERK phosphorylation by gel retardation assay showed that the IL-2-induced phosphorylation was unaffected by 10 μm SB203580 (Fig.4 c), as was the SAPK/JNK activation measured by GST-ATF-2 phosphorylation in specific immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 d), indicating the specificity of the compound. This study shows that the previously termed “stress-activated kinases,” p38MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK are activated in T cells by the mitogenic cytokines IL-2 and IL-7. Moreover evidence is presented that p38MAP kinase is involved in transducing these mitogenic responses. This is in contrast to ERK, which has been shown previously not to be necessary for T cell proliferation (14Crawley J.B. Willcocks J. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2717-2733Google Scholar), opposing the paradigm in other cells that it is ERK that is required for proliferative effects and that p38MAP kinase is involved in stress responses. The activation of p38MAP kinase by IL-2 and IL-7 is the first evidence of the activation of this kinase in T cells. The recent identification of highly specific pyrinidyl imidazole inhibitors of p38MAP kinase allowed us to investigate its role in T cells responding to IL-2 or IL-7. These inhibitors abrogate the synthesis of TNF-α and IL-1 by monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (42Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.-J. Heys M.J. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar), and one, termed SB203580, has been shown to be highly specific for p38MAP kinase (53Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar). The concentrations of drug that inhibited proliferation were approximately one log higher than those required to inhibit the activation of the immediate substrate MAPKAP kinase-2. This difference in dose might be partly accounted for by the nature of the two responses: one is a complex response and is measured 24 h after stimulation, the other a single enzyme assayed after 20 min. The possibility that SB203580 inhibits another protein kinase responsive to IL-2 is unlikely, as it has no activity when tested on a large number of other kinases at high concentration (53Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Google Scholar). However, the possible existence of non-kinase targets cannot be absolutely discounted. These results imply that p38MAP kinase has a novel role in mediating the proliferative response of T cells to cytokines. The nature of the signaling pathways leading to the activation of p38MAP kinase by IL-2 and IL-7 is an open question. The activation of MKK3/6 (55Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebrada A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 236: 796-805Google Scholar, 56Cuenda A. Alonso G. Morrice N. Jones M. Meier R. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4293-4301Google Scholar), the G-proteins Rac and Cdc42 and p21-activated kinase have been shown or implicated in the activation of p38MAP kinase in a variety of cells (57Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchinson M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Google Scholar, 58Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar), however the response of these to IL-2 is unknown. p21ras, which is activated by IL-2 (16Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Miyajima A. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3314-3318Google Scholar, 17Graves J.D. Downward J. Izquierdo M. Rayter S. Warne P.H. Cantrell D.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2417-2422Google Scholar), has also been suggested as a proximal activator for the kinase (59Minden A. Lin A. McCahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar). However IL-7 does not appear to stimulate the Shc/p21ras/ERK1/2 cascade (14Crawley J.B. Willcocks J. Foxwell B.M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2717-2733Google Scholar). As IL-2 and IL-7 both activate tyrosine kinases Jak1, Jak3, and p56lck (3Russell S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friemann M. Berg M.

Moreover, the events distal to the kinase are similarly unknown and warrant investigation. Our data have shown that the induction of c-Myc was not affected and that the pathway required for this event is still largely unknown. In other cells p38MAP kinase has been implicated in the translational control of TNF synthesis by unknown mechanisms (42Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.-J. Heys M.J. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). p38MAP kinase has also been shown to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors ATF-1 and CREB (54Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Google Scholar), Elk-1 (60Price M.A. Cruzalegui F.H. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6552-6563Google Scholar), CHOP (61Wang X. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Google Scholar), and ATF-2 (62Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Google Scholar). None of these are known to be activated by IL-2, and although Elk-1 is involved in promoting fos transcription induced by the cytokine, it is not required for IL-2-driven cell proliferation (27Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25423-25427Google Scholar). The role played by SAPK/JNK in IL-2 and IL-7 function could not be easily approached, as no specific inhibitor exists for this kinase. However, IL-2 does induce the synthesis of c-Jun, in which SAPK/JNK has been implicated (43Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). The activation of SAPK/JNK has been demonstrated previously in T cells (44Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Google Scholar) in response to antibody cross-linking of CD3 and CD28. This involves a calcium signal, a requirement unique to T lymphocytes. However, neither IL-2 nor IL-7 elevate intracellular calcium (2Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Google Scholar), and thus the mechanism of activation of SAPK/JNK in T cells by cytokines is distinct from that described previously. Nothing is known of the response of MKK4 (63Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.-H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Google Scholar, 64Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar) or MEKK (59Minden A. Lin A. McCahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar), which are proximal activators of SAPK/JNK, to IL-2 and IL-7. Furthermore despite its activation by some growth factors, e.g. epidermal growth factor on HeLa cells (58Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Google Scholar), cholecystokinin on pancreatic cells (65Dabrowski A. Grady T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5686-5690Google Scholar), and both endothelin and thrombin on airway smooth muscle cells (66Shapiro P.S. Evans J.N. Davis R.J. Posada J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5750-5754Google Scholar), no role for SAPK/JNK in T cell mitogenesis has been defined. In summary, we have shown that the previously termed stress-activated kinases p38MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK are activated in T cells by the mitogenic cytokines IL-2 and IL-7. Furthermore, using the specific inhibitor SB203580 a previously undescribed role for p38MAP kinase in mitogenesis has been observed. Moreover, p38MAP kinase is one of the few elements of IL-2 and IL-7 signaling pathways that can be ascribed a role in T cell proliferation. The involvement of these kinases in inflammatory responses has identified them as likely therapeutic targets. The observation that these kinases are also activated by T cell mitogenic cytokines and that at least p38MAP kinase has a role in transducing the proliferative response could have important consequences for any pharmacological modulation of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2088463717,"Early heart failure is characterized by elevated plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels, but little is known about the direct effects of ANP on cardiac myocytes. In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, ANP induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and cell type-specific manner. Maximum effects occurred at 1 μm ANP, with a 4–5-fold increase in apoptotic cells, reaching a maximum apoptotic index of 19%. In contrast, the maximum apoptotic index of ANP-treated non-myocytes was 1.1 ± 0.2%, equivalent to control cultures. ANP treatment also sharply reduced levels of Mcl-1 mRNA, a Bcl-2 homologue, coincident with the increase in the incidence of apoptosis. ANP induction of apoptosis was receptor-dependent and mediated by cyclic GMP: the effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeable analog, and by sodium nitroprusside, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, and was potentiated by a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast. Interestingly, norepinephrine, a myocyte growth factor, inhibited ANP-induced apoptosis via activation of the β-adrenergic receptor and elevation of cyclic AMP. These results show that ANP is a specific effector of cardiac myocyte apoptosis in culture via receptor-mediated elevation of cGMP. Furthermore, at least in this model, ANP and norepinephrine may have opposing roles in the modulation of cardiac myocyte growth and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2753765968,"This chapter describes the genetic and physical maps of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic and physical maps of the chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are based on the data presented in the genetic map of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genetic maps are composed of solid vertical lines (representing map distances determined by tetrad analysis) or dashed lines (indicating linkages established by mitotic recombination analysis), with centromeres represented as circles and with the left arm above and the fight arm below the centromere. Horizontal lines indicate the genetic position of a gene. In crowded regions, gene names often are not lined up with their corresponding horizontal lines. Vertical bars indicate a region within which a gene maps. Gene symbols are provided in the table in which synonyms are separated by commas. In group of genes, capitalized gene symbols do not necessarily indicate dominance. Instead, they signify that the cloned gene is used to assign the gene to that chromosome. The physical maps are drawn as vertical helical lines. Gene symbols are in capital letters on the physical maps. The telomeres, when their positions relative to genes were known, are drawn as open arrows. Vertical bars next to the helical lines indicate the size of the restriction fragment on which a gene is located or region of uncertainty about the physical location of genes. Parentheses are no longer used to indicate uncertain gene order."
https://openalex.org/W2052297575,"Previously we demonstrated that nonvisual arrestins exhibit a high affinity interaction with clathrin, consistent with an adaptor function in the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (Goodman, O. B., Jr., Krupnick, J. G., Santini, F., Gurevich, V. V., Penn, R. B., Gagnon, A. W., Keen, J. H., and Benovic, J. L. (1996) Nature 383, 447-450). In this report we show that a short sequence of highly conserved residues within the globular clathrin terminal domain is responsible for arrestin binding. Limited proteolysis of clathrin cages results in the release of terminal domains and concomitant abrogation of arrestin binding. The nonvisual arrestins, beta-arrestin and arrestin3, but not visual arrestin, bind specifically to a glutathione S-transferase-clathrin terminal domain fusion protein. Deletion analysis and alanine scanning mutagenesis localize the binding site to residues 89-100 of the clathrin heavy chain and indicate that residues 1-100 can function as an independent arrestin binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis identifies an invariant glutamine (Glu-89) and two highly conserved lysines (Lys-96 and Lys-98) as residues critical for arrestin binding, complementing hydrophobic and acidic residues in arrestin3 which have been implicated in clathrin binding (Krupnick, J. G., Goodman, O. B., Jr., Keen, J. H., and Benovic, J. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 15011-15016). Despite exhibiting high affinity clathrin binding, arrestins do not induce coat assembly. The terminal domain is oriented toward the plasma membrane in coated pits, and its binding of both arrestins and AP-2 suggests that this domain is the anchor responsible for adaptor-receptor recruitment to the coated pit."
https://openalex.org/W2007981025,"Integrin-associated protein (IAP or CD47) is a receptor for the cell/platelet-binding domain (CBD) of thrombospondin-1 (TS1), the most abundant protein of platelet α granules. Although it associates with αIIbβ3, IAP has no known function in platelets. TS1, the CBD, and an IAP agonist peptide (4N1K) from the CBD of TS1 activate the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, resulting in platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen, stimulation of platelet aggregation, and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase. Furthermore, 4N1K peptide selectively stimulates the phosphorylation of LYN and SYK and their association with FAK. The phosphorylation of SYK is blocked by pertussis toxin, implicating a G<sub>i</sub>-like heterotrimeric G protein. IAP solublized from membranes of unstimulated platelets binds specifically to an affinity column of 4N1K peptide. Both αIIb and β3 integrin subunits and c-Src bind along with IAP. This complex of proteins is also detected with immunoprecipitation. Activation of platelets with the agonist peptide 4N1K results in the association of FAK with the IAP-αIIbβ3 complex. Thus an important function of TS1 in platelets is that of a secreted costimulator of αIIbβ3 whose unique properties result in its localization to the platelet surface and the fibrin clot."

Fusion of the C terminus of the CCKAR to the N terminus of the GFP did not alter receptor ligand binding affinity, signal transduction, or the pattern of receptor surface expression and receptor-mediated cholecystokinin (CCK) internalization. The use of a new GFP mutant with increased fluorescence allowed the continuous observation of CCKAR-GFP in stably expressing cell lines. Newly obtained biologically active fluorescent derivatives of CCK were used for simultaneous observation of receptor and ligand trafficking in CHO, NIH/3T3, and HeLa cells stably expressing the fluorescent CCKAR and in transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Receptor internalization was predominantly ligand dependent in HeLa, COS-1, and CHO cells, but was mostly constitutive in NIH/3T3 cells, suggesting the existence of cell-specific regulation of receptor internalization. The CCKAR antagonists, L-364,718 and CCK 27–32 amide potently inhibited spontaneous internalization of the receptor. The average sorting time of CCK and the receptor in the endosomes was about 25 min. The receptor recycled back to the cell membrane with an average time of 60 min. While the ligands sorted to lysosomes, no receptor molecules could be detected there, and no receptor degradation was observed during recycling.

This very broad spectrum of activities indicates that these receptors have a central role in cell biology and in many cases may be attractive targets for drug development. G protein-coupled receptor function is significantly regulated by the mechanisms that determine receptor trafficking within the cell. The molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in regulation of translocation, sequestration, recycling, and degradation of G protein-coupled receptors are not well understood, and the available data are largely controversial. The study of the trafficking by means of localization of the receptors with antibodies is laborious and does not allow for the efficient observation of receptor translocation in intracellular compartments. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jelly fish is becoming widely used as a molecular reporter to monitor gene expression, localization, and intracellular protein trafficking in living cells (1Chalfie M.

Many GFP-tagged proteins retain their biological activity and have the same trafficking pattern as the native proteins (4Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Google Scholar, 5Stauber R.H. Gaitanaris G.A. Pavlakis G.N. Virology. 1995; 213: 439-449Google Scholar, 6Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Google Scholar). However, the majority of the proteins that have been labeled with GFP for microscopy studies are expressed at relatively high levels, which makes the detection of the fusion proteins significantly easier. Localization of GPCR is a technically challenging procedure because most of the receptors are expressed at very low levels. The approaches utilizing either cells that overexpress the receptors or the use of GFP mutants with much higher fluorescence than that of the wild type protein can be applied for the localization of labeled GPCR in living cells. In the present paper we have explored the possibilities of GFP labeling for the study of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking using the type A cholecystokinin receptor (CCKAR). Cholecystokinin, a well studied bioactive peptide, was initially discovered in the gut and subsequently in the central nervous system (9Crawley J.N. Corwin R.L. Peptides. 1994; 15: 731-755Google Scholar). It exerts numerous effects through its action as a hormone and a neurotransmitter. The CCKAR was well characterized with respect to the mechanisms of signal transduction (10Yule D.I. Tseng M.-J. Williams J.A. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G999-G1004Google Scholar) and phosphorylation upon ligand binding (11Ozcelebi F. Rao R.V. Holicky E. Madden B.J. McCormick D.J. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3750-3755Google Scholar). It was shown to undergo sequestration upon binding of agonists (12Svoboda M. Dupuche M.H. Lambert M. Bui D. Christophe J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1055: 207-216Google Scholar, 13Roettger B.F. Rentsch R.U. Hadac E.M. Hellen E.H. Burghardt T.P. Miller L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 579-590Google Scholar, 14Izzo R.S. Pellecchia C.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1029-1041Google Scholar) like many other GPCR. It was suggested that internalization of the CCKAR and many other GPCRs is ligand-dependent, but direct proof has been missing. It is also unclear whether only binding of agonistsversus antagonists can trigger GPCR internalization, since it has been shown that signal transduction is not necessary for internalization (18Hunyady L. Baukal A.J. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24798-24804Google Scholar). Furthermore, cell surface receptor trafficking has not been directly observed previously in real time in living cells. To address these questions, we have developed the tools that allowed for the direct observation of the CCKAR and its ligand in living cells in real time, and have applied them for the study of receptor and ligand trafficking in four different cell types. Attachment of GFP did not influence receptor expression, affinity, signal transduction, or internalization. The fluorescence of the newly created mutant of GFP 2R. H. Stauber, P. Carney, G. A.

The humanized S65T GFP, phGFP-S65T (CLONTECH), was mutated to phGFP-F64L,T65C,I167T by site-directed mutagenesis (Muta-Gene® phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit, Bio-Rad).2 EitherXbaI and BamHI along with a stop codon (CCKAR-hGFP) or EcoRI and XbaI (hGFP-CCKAR) restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mutated hGFP using PCR. Either the 5′ or 3′ end of CKKAR was ligated to the 3′ or the 5′ end of the mutant hGFP, respectively, with T4 DNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the fused product subcloned into either pCDL-SRα or pCDL-SRα/Neo at the EcoRI andBamHI sites. Alternatively, to generate pF25-CCKAR-GFP, the coding region of the rat CCKAR was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers containingNheI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested withNheI and cloned into the NheI-cut vector pCMV-GFPsg25. Plasmid pCMV-GFPsg25 expresses a mutated GFP protein under the control of the early cytomegalovirus promoter.2 Two micrograms of pCDL-SRα containing either the wild type rat CCKAR, CCKAR-hGFP, or hGFP-CCKAR cDNA insert subcloned at the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the sense orientation were transfected into near confluent COS-1 cells using the DEAE/dextran method as described (21Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Google Scholar). Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and replated on glass coverslips for examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy at 48 h. The wild type rat CCKAR and CCKAR-hGFP cDNAs were stably transfected by electroporation (500 millifarads, 0.25 kV, Bio-Rad Gene Pulser) of 2 × 107 CHO and NIH/3T3-cell/ml in a volume of 0.25 ml with 20 μg of the linearized recombinant pCDL-SRα/Neo containing either the wild type rat CCKAR or CCKAR-hGFP cDNA subcloned at the EcoRI andBamHI sites in the sense orientation in the presence of 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA as a carrier. Cell clones stably expressing the receptors were then selected for G-418 resistance (250 μg of G-418/ml) and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Coulter, ECP- Elite, Miami, FL). NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% calf serum, 250 μg/ml G-418, and CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 250 μg/ml G-418 at 37 °C in a 6% CO2 atmosphere. To generate CCKAR-GFPsg25-expressing HeLa cell lines, 5 × 105 HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of pF25CCKAR-GFP by the calcium phosphate method. Two days after transfection, single cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting was performed into 96-well plates without prior selection. Sorting was performed on a FACStar Plus platform (Becton Dickinson). An argon ion laser at a wavelength of 488 nm was used to excite GFPsg25 (run at 200 milliwatts with a 500-nm long pass emission filter). Positive, CCKAR-GFPsg25-expressing single cell colonies were identified using an inverted fluorescence microscope and further expanded in DMEM, 10% calf serum, 500 μg/ml G-418). Stably transfected CHO cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates and assayed the following day for radioligand binding. For binding displacement studies, cells were incubated for 90 min with 50 pm125I-CCK-8 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of cold CCK-8 in 0.5 ml of DMEM, 0.1% BSA at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined as total binding in the presence of 1 μm cold CCK-8 and was always less than 10% of total binding. After termination of the binding reaction by washing the cells two times with PBS, 0.1% BSA at 4 °C, cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 0.1 nKOH and radioactivity was detected in a Packard/Autogamma counter. Binding parameters, Kd andBmax, were determined with the nonlinear least squares curve fitting computer program, LIGAND (22Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-229Google Scholar). The wild type rat CCKAR and CCKAR-GFP cDNAs were sequenced using the Dye Terminator kit and a model 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Stably transfected CHO cells were plated at a density of 2.0 × 105 cells/well on 24-well culture plates with DMEM, 10% calf serum in the presence of 100 mCi/mlmyo-2-[3H]inositol and incubated overnight. The following day, the medium was aspirated and the cells were incubated with PI buffer (20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm, glucose, 0.5% BSA) and exposed to the indicated concentrations of peptide. Total [3H]inositol phosphates were measured by strong anion exchange chromatography (Dowex AG 1-X8), using a modification of the method described by Berridge et al. (23Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M. Downs C.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Google Scholar). Eluates were assayed using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Cholecystokinin octapeptide (6 mg, 5 μmol) was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile (50 μl) and aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (0.2 m, pH 9.0, 50 μl). A solution of either Rhodamine Green trifluoroacetic acid, succinimidyl ester (5 mg, 7.5 μmol) or Cy3.29 succinimidyl ester (5 mg, 7.5 μmol) in dimethylformamide (10 μl) was added under nitrogen in the dark. The reaction mixtures were stirred at room temperature overnight. A fresh, aqueous solution of hydroxylamine (25 μl, 1.5 m, pH = 7.8) was added. After 2 h the reaction mixtures were dissolved in 30% aqueous acetonitrile (4 ml), and products were separated by HPLC under reverse-phase conditions using a semipreparative YMC-Pack ODS-AM column (10 mm × 300 mm), (eluent: acetonitrile/water/0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient 30–70% of acetonitrile, 60 min). Yields were 30–50%. NMR spectroscopy was performed on a Varian VXR-500 spectrometer (500 MHz for1H). The mass spectra were generated on a Bruker Reflex II time of flight mass spectrometer. For RG-CCK-8, mass spectra were as follows: C70H73N12O20S3Na calculated, 1521.6; found, m/z = 1521.9; C70H73N12O17S2Na calculated, 1441.5; found, m/z = 1441.7; C70H74N12O17S2calculated, 1419.5; found, m/z= 1420.2. For Cy3.29-CCK-8, mass spectra were as follows: C76H90N12O23S5calculated, 1699.9; found, m/z = 1696.8. Double quantum tilted correlation NMR spectra of RG-CCK-8 and Cy3.29-CCK-8 (data not shown) had all expected cross-peaks for NH-αH-βH systems, and aliphatic and aromatic parts of the molecules. Cells were grown in Nunc cover glass chamber slides in medium without phenol red and observed on a Zeiss inverted LSM 410 laser scanning confocal microscope. Fluorescence of rhodamine green, LysoTracker Green, and GFP was excited using a 488-nm argon/krypton laser, and emitted fluorescence was detected with 515–540-nm band pass filter. For LysoTracker Red, rhodamine red, Cy3.29-CCK-8, and tetramethylrhodamine, a 568-nm helium/neon laser was used for excitation and fluorescence was detected with a 590-nm band pass filter. The cells were incubated for 1 h with various concentrations of the compound in phenol red-free medium in a CO2 incubator. Cells were rinsed three times with medium and observed under the microscope using identical parameters for all concentrations. The images were stored on an optical disk and analyzed with Zeiss LSM software. A minimum of 10 images for each concentration were quantitated. The cells were rinsed with cold PBS and treated with rhodamine red concanavalin A (10 μg/ml in PBS) for 2 min at 4 °C. After a final rinse with cold PBS, the cell were observed with a confocal microscope using 63× oil immersion lens, a pinhole of 35, and an electronic zoom of 3 to yield a final magnification of 2016× of the stored images. Fluorescence pixels of the green fluorescence and of the colocalization mask of green and red fluorescence were counted with Zeiss LSM software. The percentage of the receptor on the cell surface was determined as the ratio of the colocalization mask pixels and total green fluorescence. The cells were preincubated for 30 min with 100 nm RG-CCK-8 or Cy3.29-CCK-8 at 4 °C, rinsed with cold medium, and placed under the microscope. Images of a selected group of cells were taken at 1-min intervals at 20 °C. The cells were treated with the lysosomal markers at 37 °C in CO2 incubator for 15 min, rinsed with medium and incubated with 100 nm RG-CCK-8 or Cy3.29-CCK-8 in a CO2 incubator for various time periods, rinsed, and observed with the confocal microscope. CHO cells, transfected with rat CCK-A receptor cDNA were grown almost to confluence and pretreated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. After 30 min of incubation, 100 nm RG-CCK-8 was added in the medium without phenol red. The cells were incubated in a CO2incubator for various time periods, rinsed with medium and observed with the inverted confocal microscope. A minimum of 10 images for each incubation time point were recorded, and the fluorescence intensity was quantitated by processing the data using Zeiss LSM software. To study the localization and trafficking of the CCKAR in live cells, we constructed a chimeric cDNA of the coding region of the rat CCKAR and fused its C terminus before the stop codon, to the full coding region of the mutant GFP cDNA. The C terminus of GFP was also fused to the N terminus of the receptor resulting in GFP-CCKAR. The receptor fused to the T65S mutant of GFP (24Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Google Scholar) could be visualized by CLSM in transiently transfected COS-1 that overexpressed CCKAR-GFP, but the intensity of T65S GFP fluorescence was not sufficient for detection of receptor molecules in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells that expressed natural levels of the receptor. The use of the GFP molecule with mutations that were found previously to increase the fluorescence approximately 150-fold (F64L, T65C, and I167T)2 allowed for direct observation of the fusion receptor in stably transfected cells. GFP-CCKAR, when expressed in COS-1 cells, showed no binding of 125I-CCK-8. Confocal microscopy revealed that GFP-CCKAR had an intracellular localization, suggesting that attachment of the GFP to the N terminus of the CCKAR abrogates the transport of the receptor to the cell membrane. To determine the effect of fusing GFP to the intracellular C terminus of the CCKAR on receptor function, CHO cells expressing wild type CCKAR were compared with CHO cells expressing CCKAR-GFP for cell surface receptor density, CCK-8 affinity, and CCK-8-stimulated signal transduction. The CHO cells expressed CCKAR-GFP on their surface with a similar density (Bmax = 1.75 ± 0.63 × 105 receptors/cell) and affinity for CCK-8 (Kd = 5.93 ± 2.19 × 10−9) compared with CHO cells expressing wild type CCKAR (Bmax = 1.70 ± 0.29 × 105 receptors/cell and Kd = 3.78 ± 0.71 × 10−9) (Fig. 1). Consistent with the receptor density and CCK-8 affinity results, the CHO cells expressing wild type CCKAR responded to CCK-8 stimulation of total inositol phosphates in a concentration-dependent manner similar to the CHO cells expressing the CCKAR-GFP. CCK-8 stimulated total inositol phosphates 5.4 ± 1.0-fold in the CHO cells expressing wild type CCKAR, with an EC50 of 1.73 ± 0.28 nm compared with 7.36 ± 3.3-fold increase and an EC50 of 4.38 ± 3.3 nm for the CHO cells expressing the CCKAR-GFP (Fig. 2).Figure 2Ability of CCK-8 to increase total inositol phosphates in CHO cells stably expressing wild type CCKAR and CCKAR-GFP. Data are shown as the CCK-8-stimulated increase in total inositol phosphates divided by the unstimulated basal total inositol phosphates and represent the mean ± the standard error from at least three experiments performed in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In a previous study we compared the properties of three fluorescent derivatives of gastrin, rhodamine green, BODIPY, and Cy3.29 heptagastrin (25Czerwinski G. Wank S.A. Tarasova N.I. Hudson E.A. Resau J.H. Michejda C.J. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 235-242Google Scholar). The rhodamine green (RG) moiety provided the strongest fluorescence intensity, chemical and light stability and resistance to intracellular degradation within the cells necessary for the kinetic studies of ligand uptake. Cy3.29 derivatives have emission maximum at 570 nm and do not emit below 540 nm and thus allow for simultaneous detection of the GFP fluorescence. Rhodamine green and Cy3.29-CCK-8 were obtained by the method used earlier for the synthesis of heptagastrin derivatives (25Czerwinski G. Wank S.A. Tarasova N.I. Hudson E.A. Resau J.H. Michejda C.J. Lett. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 235-242Google Scholar). The structures of the compounds were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Both RG and Cy3.29-CCK-8 retained a high affinity toward the gastrin receptor (Kd = 8 ± 3.0 nm in displacement of 125I-labeled cholecystokinin-8 by RG-CCK-8) and showed specific binding to NIH/3T3, CHO, and HeLa cells stably transfected with rat CCKAR cDNA, but not to untransfected cells. The concentration dependence of binding of RG-CCK-8 and Cy3.29-CCK-8 to NIH/3T3 cells transfected with CCK-A receptor cDNA (Fig.3 A) showed a typical saturation curve, usually observed for radiolabeled hormones upon binding to their receptors. The KD for the binding was calculated from these data to be 0.7 ± 0.2 nm for RG-CCK-8 and 2.5 ± 0.5 nm for Cy3.29-CCK-8. Preincubation of the cells with 10 μm cholecystokinin for 10 min reduced fluorescence of bound fluorescent derivatives of CCK to background levels. Both compounds induced intracellular Ca2+ release in NIH/3T3 cells transfected with CCKAR at concentrations as low as 10 nm (Fig. 3 B), which was identical to that of the parent peptide, indicating that the derivatives retained the biological properties of CCK-8. To estimate the time needed for internalization, the cells expressing the CCKAR or CCKAR-GFP were saturated with Cy3.29-CCK-8 at 4 °C for 30 min, rinsed with medium, and observed by confocal microscopy at 20 °C at 1-min intervals. No internalization was observed at 4 °C, but at 20 °C the bound ligand was clustered into aggregates on the cell surface with evidence of internalization as early as 4–7 min of incubation. The pattern of ligand binding and internalization time was identical in the case of the cells expressing wild type CCKAR and CCKAR-GFP (data not shown) and identical to cholecystokinin receptor type B, which had been characterized earlier (26Tarasova N.I. Wank S.A. Czerwinski G. Romanov V.A. Hudson E.A. Resau J.H. Michejda C.J. Cell Tiss. Res. 1997; 287: 325-333Google Scholar). Intracellular stability of rhodamine green dye allowed us to develop a technique for the study of accumulation of fluorescent peptides within cells (26Tarasova N.I. Wank S.A. Czerwinski G. Romanov V.A. Hudson E.A. Resau J.H. Michejda C.J. Cell Tiss. Res. 1997; 287: 325-333Google Scholar), which was applied to RG-CCK-8. The curve for the accumulation of the fluorescent ligand with time (Fig.4) revealed a periodic pattern, that was observed earlier for the gastrin/cholecystokinin B receptor (26Tarasova N.I. Wank S.A. Czerwinski G. Romanov V.A. Hudson E.A. Resau J.H. Michejda C.J. Cell Tiss. Res. 1997; 287: 325-333Google Scholar) and suggests that there is a periodicity for receptor recycling back to the cell surface and subsequent uptake of RG-CCK-8. Assuming that the plateaus on the curve (Fig. 4) correspond to the periods when nearly all receptor molecules are sequestered, an average recycling time for the CCKAR deduced from these data is approximately 60 min. The kinetics of ligand accumulation in the cells expressing the fluorescent receptor could not be studied because the fluorescence of RG-CCK-8 interferes with the fluorescence of GFP and the Cy3.29 moiety was not sufficiently stable within intracellular compartments. The major part of the green fluorescence corresponding to CCKAR-GFP was observed on the cell membrane in CHO and HeLa cells stably transfected with CCKAR-GFP (Fig. 5, Aand B). The receptor molecules appeared to be evenly distributed on the plasma membrane. A significant part of the fluorescence was on the cellular membrane in transiently transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 5 D). However, COS-1 and HeLa cells also had significant labeling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (identified with the help of the red fluorescent ER marker, the hexyl ester of rhodamine 6G (27Terasaki M. Reese T.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 315-322Google Scholar); Fig. 6, A andB, respectively). In CHO cells, a small part of the fluorescence was diffusely distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig.5 A). Surprisingly, in stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells, the fluorescent receptor had a predominantly intracellular localization (Fig. 5 C). To determine the relative distribution of the fluorescent CCKAR-GFP, the cell surface was labeled by a brief exposure to rhodamine B concanavalin A. The green fluorescence of CCKAR-GFP that appeared to colocalize with the red fluorescence of ConA was considered to correspond to the receptor molecules residing on the plasma membrane. Total CCKAR-GFP fluorescence and the fluorescent component that colocalized with ConA were quantitated with the help of Zeiss LSM software. In the absence of the ligand, CHO cells had 75.8 ± 9.4% of the receptors on the cell surface, HeLa cells had 64 ± 9.1%, and NIH/3T3 had 25.6 ± 6.3%. In transiently transfected COS-1 cells that overexpressed CCKAR-GFP, part of the GFP fluorescence colocalized with the mitochondrial marker, MitoTracker Red CMXRos (28Nakata T. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1039Google Scholar), while no receptor could be detected in mitochondria in stably transfected cells (data not shown). Fluorescence could also be detected in endosomes and lysosomes, indicating that overexpression of the receptor may change the pattern of receptor localization.Figure 6Colocalization of CCKAR-GFP (ingreen) with the ER marker hexyl ester of rhodamine 6G (red) in COS-1 cells, transiently transfected with the receptor (A), and in HeLa cells stably expressing the receptor (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In all three stably transfected cell lines, addition of CCK-8 caused the green fluorescence of the receptor to disappear almost completely from the cell surface and to move into intracellular vesicles identified by the tetramethyl rhodamine derivative of transferrin, used as a marker of endosomal compartments. In the absence of the ligand, almost no receptor molecules could be detected in endosomes in CHO and HeLa cells (Fig.7 A). Within minutes after addition of the ligand, significant intracellular colocalization of the receptor with transferrin could be observed indicating the occurrence of ligand-induced endocytosis of the receptor (Fig. 7 B). In NIH/3T3 cells, CCKAR-GFP showed partial colocalization with transferrin even in the absen"
https://openalex.org/W2131845563,"The neurotransmitter serotonin mediates a wide variety of peripheral and central physiological effects through the binding to multiple receptor subtypes (Wilkinson, L. O., and Dourish, C. T. (1991) in Serotonin Receptor Subtypes: Basic and Clinical Aspects (Peroutka, S. J., ed) Vol. 15, pp.147–210, Wiley-Liss, New York). Among them, serotonin 5-HT2A receptors are known to activate the phospholipase C-β second messenger pathway (Peroutka, S. J. (1995) Trends Neurosci.18, 68–69). We identified and localized in rat skeletal muscle myoblasts a functional serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. This receptor was detected on the plasma membrane, in myoblasts, and at the level of T-tubules in contracting myotubes. Binding of serotonin to its receptor increases the expression of genes involved in myogenic differentiation. Unexpectedly, the 5-HT2A receptor is able to activate another signaling pathway; it triggers a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 kinase in response to serotonin. Jak2 auto-phosphorylation is followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (signaltransducers and activators oftranscription) and its translocation into the nucleus. We also find that the 5-HT2A receptor and STAT3 co-precipitate with Jak2, indicating that they are physically associated. We conclude that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor identified in skeletal muscle myoblasts is able to activate the intracellular phosphorylation pathway used by cytokines. The presence of serotonin receptors in T-tubules suggests a role for serotonin in excitation-contraction coupling and (or) an effect in skeletal muscle fiber repairing.

Dourish C.T. Peroutka S.J. Serotonin Receptor Subtypes: Basic and Clinical Aspects. Wiley-Liss, New York1991: pp.147-210Google Scholar). The physiological effects of serotonin are mediated by at least four families of 5-HT receptors that have been distinguished pharmacologically, depending on the second messenger they are coupled to. The first family, including 5-HT1 and 5-HT5receptor subtypes, interacts negatively with adenylate cyclase, whereas the second family (5-HT2) is coupled to the activation of phospholipase C-β/protein kinase C. The 5-HT3 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel, and the family including 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor subtypes activates adenylate cyclase (2Peroutka S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 68-69Google Scholar). The receptors of the 5-HT2 subfamily are implicated in many central physiological functions of serotonin, such as neuronal sensitization to tactile stimuli and mediation of hallucinogenic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide, as well as in peripheral cardiovascular effects, e.g. contraction of blood vessels and shape change in platelets. The 5-HT2A (formerly 5-HT2) receptor shares an overall 49% sequence identity with the 5-HT2C (formerly 5-HT1C) receptor, but they present different patterns of expression in the brain (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar). Transfection of both 5-HT2C and 5-HT2Areceptors in NIH3T3 fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and focus formation (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar). The mouse 5-HT2B receptor, mainly expressed in the cardiovascular system, gut, and developing brain (4Loric S. Launay J.M. Colas J.F. Maroteaux L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 203-207Google Scholar), shares the highest degree of homology with the other 5-HT2Breceptors cloned from the rat fundus or from human libraries (5Baxter G. Kenett G. Blaney F. Blackburn T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 105-110Google Scholar). The 5-HT2B receptor has been classified as a ligand-dependent proto-oncogene, since its expression is necessary and sufficient to induce tumor formation in nude mice (6Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol.

To date, serotonin receptors have never been isolated in skeletal muscle cells. The present study reports the identification and localization of a functional skeletal muscle serotonin 5-HT2A receptor in rat fetal myoblasts. This receptor mediates the serotonin-induced up-regulation of the transcription factor myogenin, and the neuronal glucose transporter isoform GLUT3, both expressed during myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, we show that the skeletal muscle serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is capable of stimulating the Jak/STAT pathway. Primary cultures of myoblasts from 19-day-old rat fetuses were grown as described previously (9Guillet-Deniau I. Leturque A. Girard J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 487-496Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Myoblasts were separated from muscle fibers by a treatment (20 min, 37 °C) with 0.15% protease (Sigma) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Myoblasts were plated at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/ml on gelatin-coated flasks, in minimal essential medium/199 medium (2/1) containing 10% horse serum and 0.2% Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson). Serum and Matrigel were removed 24 h before the beginning of the experiments. Media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal calf serum and horse serum were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Using total RNA isolated from 3-day-cultured fetal myoblasts as a template, first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription, using a cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perkin Elmer). For amplification of the cDNA fragments by the PCR, 21-mer oligonucleotide primers were designed, based on a portion of the third intracytoplasmic loop of the rat 5-HT2A receptor cDNA (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession no. M30705). Forward (sense) primer was 5′-ACC TAC TTC CTG ACT ATC AAG-3′ (nucleotides 816–837). Reverse (antisense) primer was 3′-GCC CAG CAC CTT GCA CGC CTT-5′ (nucleotides 1016–1037). PCR fragments were subcloned into the BamHI-EcoRI sites of a Bluescript pBS-SK(+) plasmid (Promega), amplified in XL1 Blue, and sequenced. Myoblasts were treated with 5·10−6m serotonin hydrochloride (Sigma) in the presence of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (10−6m) in some experiments (Research Biochemicals Inc.) Total RNA was extracted from the cells by the guanidine thiocyanate method (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), then electrophoresed and transferred as described previously (9Guillet-Deniau I. Leturque A. Girard J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 487-496Google Scholar). Northern blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes coding for GLUT3, GLUT1 (a gift of Dr. G. Bell, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL), myogenin (provided by Dr. W. Wright, Southwestern Medical Center, University of Texas, Dallas, TX), and serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (cDNA cloned by reverse transcription-PCR). Fetal myoblasts were grown on gelatin-coated Permanox four-chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Nunc) for 3 days (fusioning myoblasts) or 8 days (contracting myotubes) as described previously (9Guillet-Deniau I. Leturque A. Girard J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 487-496Google Scholar). The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor was detected using a monoclonal anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody (PharMingen). Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in diluted antibody (dilution 1/500 in PBS, 0.2% gelatin), then washed three times with PBS, and treated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1/128, Sigma). The slides were mounted in a glycerol/PBS mounting medium (Cityfluor), and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed, using a Leica confocal imaging system (TCS-4D) and an immersion lens (63×, numerical aperture 1.4 plan Apochromat). A focal series of up to 18 sections apart (0.5 μm between two adjacent sections) was collected for each specimen and then processed to produce single composite images (extended focus). Micrographs were printed directly from the computer on a dye sublimation printer (Colorease, Eastman Kodak Co.). Polyclonal anti-mouse Jak2 and anti-human/mouse Jak2/protein A-agarose were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal anti-STATs antibodies and biotinylated recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine (RC 20-B) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse Ig-peroxidase-linked whole antibodies were obtained from Amersham. Myoblasts were exposed to 5·10−6m serotonin for 0, 1, 5, 30, or 60 min in serum-deprived minimal essential medium/199 medium at 37 °C. Cells were scraped on ice in phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation, in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 50 mmNa3P2O7, 1% Triton X-100, 0.4 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 μg·ml−1pepstatin A, 2 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, and 5 μg·ml−1 aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, to remove insoluble material. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using 10 μg of anti-Jak2/protein A-agarose, or 5 μg of biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC 20-B). Then the immune complexes were precipitated for 2 h at 4 °C by addition of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia), for anti-Jak2 antibody, or streptavidin immobilized on agarose (Pierce) for biotinylated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed in cold lysis buffer, boiled in 2 × Laemmli's buffer, and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 75 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20), or 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer, for anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Membranes were incubated with the relevant primary antibody, washed, incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and washed again. Blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). Myoblasts were exposed to 5·10−6m serotonin for 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min. Nuclei were isolated according to the protocol described by Shapiro et al. (11Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, recovered by scraping, then pelleted and resuspended in 300 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.75 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm spermine, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 0.5 μg·ml−1leupeptin, 0.5 μg·ml−1 pepstatin A, 1% aprotinin). Cells were broken by 3 strokes of the tight pestle of a Dounce homogenizer, after addition of hypotonic buffer containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40. Sucrose restore buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 μg·ml−1pepstatin A, 2 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, and 5 μg·ml−1 aprotinin, 67.5% (w/v) sucrose) was rapidly added and the homogenate mixed with 2 strokes of the loose pestle of the homogenizer. After centrifugation (1 min at 12,000 ×g, 4 °C), the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 10% glycerol nuclear resuspension buffer. The nuclear resuspension was treated according to Shapiro. Nuclear proteins (40 μg) were electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described for immunoprecipitation assays. Using total RNA isolated from 3-day-cultured myoblasts as a template, the first strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Since the homology within the transmembrane domains of 5-HT2receptors is over 80%, we chose, for amplification of the cDNA fragment by PCR, two oligonucleotide primers in a portion of the nonconserved domain of the 5-HT2A receptor, the third intracytoplasmic loop (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar). Sequencing of the amplified 221-base pair cDNA fragment presented 100% homology with nucleotide 816–1037 of the rat 5-HT2A receptor cDNA (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar). Although poly(A)+ RNA from the cortex revealed two discrete transcripts between 5 and 6 kb, corresponding to 5-HT2Areceptor mRNAs (3Julius D. Huang K.M. Livelli T.J. Axel R. Jessell T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 928-932Google Scholar), this cDNA recognized in total RNA (40 μg) from rat fetal myoblasts a major 6.0-kb and a minor 4.0-kb transcript (Fig. 1 B). The neuronal isoform GLUT3 is the main glucose transporter isoform expressed during fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, e.g. between day 3 and day 4 of culture (9Guillet-Deniau I. Leturque A. Girard J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 487-496Google Scholar). Preliminary dose-response experiments showed that 5·10−6m serotonin induced a maximal increase in mRNA expression, in 3-day-cultured myoblasts (data not shown). A time course of serotonin effect was performed after treatment of 3-day-cultured myoblasts with 5·10−6m serotonin, for times ranging from 1.5 to 24 h. In control cells, GLUT3 mRNA expression increased transiently between day 3 and day 4, as expected (9Guillet-Deniau I. Leturque A. Girard J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 487-496Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a 2–3-fold increase in GLUT3 mRNA level was observed as soon as 1.5 h after addition of serotonin to the culture medium. The effect, maximal after 3 h, decreased to reach the control level after 9 h. A similar time course was observed on myogenin mRNA expression, whereas the ubiquitous glucose transporter isoform GLUT1 was quite unaffected (Fig.1 A). To determine if serotonin-induced up-regulation of mRNAs was mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, myoblasts were exposed to serotonin in the absence or presence of serotonin receptor antagonists, and Northern blots were hybridized with 5-HT2A receptor, GLUT3 and myogenin cDNA probes. Within 6 h, serotonin induced a 5-fold increase in 5-HT2A receptor mRNAs, and a 2–3-fold increase in GLUT3 and myogenin mRNAs (Fig.1 B). This effect was completely abolished in the presence of 1 μm ketanserin, a specific 5-HT2A receptor antagonist (Fig. 1 B), whereas zacopride, a 5-HT3inhibitor, was inefficient (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that serotonin is able to increase the expression of genes expressed during myogenic differentiation, through the skeletal muscle 5-HT2A receptor. Fetal myoblasts and contracting myotubes were stained for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by immunofluorescence, and images were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The 5-HT2A receptor was localized on the plasma membrane, in fusioning myoblasts (Fig. 2 a). Later on during myogenic differentiation, 5-HT2A receptors appeared at the level of deep invaginations of the plasma membranes, the transverse tubules (T-tubules), in contracting myotubes (Fig. 2,b–h). T-tubules are known to transmit the electrical impulses that trigger muscular contraction from the cell surface to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and to facilitate the distribution of substrates to the myofibers (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Banker A.G.E.B.Q. Myology. McGraw-Hill, New York1986: 125-154Google Scholar). The presence of serotonin receptors in T-tubules of contracting myotubes suggests a role for serotonin in excitation-contraction coupling, and (or) a trophic role for the skeletal muscle fiber. Serotonin increased gene expression through a very rapid transduction pathway, since a 1-min stimulation of myoblasts by serotonin was sufficient to induce a 50% increase in GLUT3 mRNA levels 3 h later (data not shown). The intracellular Jak/STAT pathway transduces very quickly the signal of many cytokines and peptide growth factors (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.A. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). Ligand binding rapidly triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs (14Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Google Scholar, 15Shuai K. Schindler C. Prezioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1808-1812Google Scholar) by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Jak family (16Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Sivennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar, 17Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z.

Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Sendtner M. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Science. 1994; 263: 89-92Google Scholar). To investigate whether serotonin was able to stimulate the Jak/STAT pathway, myoblasts were incubated with serotonin for 0, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min, and the association of Jak2 with the 5-HT2A receptor was assessed. Cell lysates from serotonin-treated myoblasts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody, and, after SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, immunoblotted with anti-5-HT2A receptor antibody. This antibody revealed in rat brain, used as a positive control, a strong band at 53 kDa, and a minor band at 58 kDa, probably due to post-translational modifications (glycosylation or phosphorylation) of the receptor. In myoblasts, a major band corresponding to 55 kDa was detected. The association of Jak2 with the 5-HT2A receptor was observed within 5 min after addition of serotonin, and was maximal after 15 min (Fig.3 A). To determine whether Jak2 auto-phosphorylation was induced by serotonin stimulation, Western blots of cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, then stripped and reprobed with anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig. 3 B, a). In a second protocol, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody, then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.3 B, b). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 was maximal after 30 min and then decreased until 60 min. These results show that the 5-HT2A receptor cloned in skeletal muscle myoblasts is functional and activates a pathway never described for serotonin. The activation of Jak kinases leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of STATs proteins (19Silvennoinen O. Ihle J.N. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 583-585Google Scholar, 20Velasquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). To determine which STATs proteins were phosphorylated after serotonin treatment, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and then immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies raised against STAT proteins. STAT1 α/β (p91/84), STAT3 (p92), and STAT6 (interleukin-4-STAT) were expressed in fetal myoblasts (Fig. 4, A–C). A431 cells, stimulated for 5 min with epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml), were used as a positive control for STAT1 and STAT3, and mouse 3T3 cells as a positive control for STAT6. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 occurred within 5 min of exposure of myoblasts to serotonin, and was maximal after 30 min (Fig.4 B). No tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig.4 A) or STAT6 (Fig. 4 C) was observed. In our study, only STAT3 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to binding of serotonin to the 5-HT2A receptor. To determine whether STAT3 was associated with the complex Jak2 kinase-5-HT2A receptor in response to serotonin stimulation, the same blot as in Fig. 3 A was stripped and then immunoblotted with anti-STAT3 antibody. Serotonin induced the co-precipitation of STAT3 with Jak2 within 5 min (Fig.5 A). The simultaneous co-precipitation of the 5-HT2A receptor and STAT3 with Jak2 suggests that STAT3 is associated to the receptor complex, in response to serotonin stimulation. The activated STATs dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they directly activate target genes (13Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.A. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). To test whether serotonin induced the nuclear translocation of STAT3 in myoblasts, cells were exposed to serotonin for 0, 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 min, and nuclear protein extracts were electrophoresed. Western blots were immunoblotted with anti-STAT antibodies. Serotonin induced the nuclear translocation of STAT3 within 5 min, the presence of STAT3 in the nucleus remaining at least 60 min (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, no translocation of STAT1 or STAT6 was observed (data not shown). In fetal myoblasts, serotonin triggers the recruitment of STAT3 to the Jak2–5-HT2A receptor complex, followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and its translocation into the nucleus. In this study, we tried to elucidate the mechanisms by which serotonin increased the expression of genes in relation with myogenic differentiation. We have shown that the effects of serotonin on skeletal muscle cells are mediated by a receptor of the 5-HT2 receptor subfamily, namely the 5-HT2Areceptor. This receptor is located at the level of T-tubules in contracting myotubes. The junctional T-tubules exert a dual role in muscle fibers, since they are involved both in facilitating substrate uptake, such as glucose (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Banker A.G.E.B.Q. Myology. McGraw-Hill, New York1986: 125-154Google Scholar), and excitation-contraction coupling. The presence of serotonin receptors in T-tubules underlies a trophic effect for serotonin, in skeletal muscle fibers, since serotonin increases glucose transport rate 2I. Guillet-Deniau, unpublished results. and GLUT3 glucose transporter expression in fetal myoblasts. Trophic effects of serotonin have already been described. Serotonin, detected early in embryonic development (21Lauder J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 233-240Google Scholar), plays a role in cranofacial (22Shuey D.L. Saddler T.N. Lauder J.M. Teratology. 1992; 46: 367-378Google Scholar) and cardiovascular morphogenesis (23Huether G. Rittner I. Reimer A. Adler L. Youdim M.B.H. Biog. Amines. 1992; 8: 421-430Google Scholar, 24Yavarone M.S. Shuey D.L. Tamir H. Sadler T.W. Lauder J.M. Teratology. 1993; 47: 573-584Google Scholar) by unknown molecular mechanisms. Some trophic functions of serotonin during embryogenesis have been related to the mitogenic and transforming properties of the 5-HT2Breceptor (6Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the hypothesis that serotonin could play a role in excitation-contraction coupling must be considered. The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is a member of the G protein-linked receptor superfamily known to activate the phospholipase C-β/protein kinase C pathway (2Peroutka S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 68-69Google Scholar). In fetal myoblasts, serotonin binding to the 5-HT2A receptor resulted in the stimulation of another signaling pathway, the Jak/STAT pathway. The serotonin-induced association of Jak2 to the 5-HT2Areceptor allowed the recruitment of STAT3 to the receptor complex and its subsequent phosphorylation by the phosphorylated Jak2 kinase, and led to STAT3 nuclear translocation. A similar result has been reported in human interleukin-6-treated NJBC-T cells, where the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 correlated with the rapid nuclear translocation of STAT3, and the formation of STAT3-STAT3-DNA complexes (25Zhang Z. Belnis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Google Scholar). STAT3 was reported to increase the expression of genes that are expressed in response to tissue injury and inflammation, and are referred as acute phase response genes (26Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1992; 76: 253-262Google Scholar). Some fetal myoblasts persist in adult skeletal muscle as quiescent stem cells (muscle satellite cells) that are capable of differentiation to repair muscle fibers, in case of injury. In myoblasts, the nuclear translocation of STAT3, in response to serotonin, might be related to the up-regulation of myogenin, a transcription factor involved in myogenic differentiation. This point requires further studies. The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor we cloned in skeletal muscle is the second member of the seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor superfamily able to activate the Jak/STAT pathway, after the angiotensin AT1 receptor, in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (27Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Google Scholar, 28Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that contractions of rat aortic smooth muscle cells are stimulated by serotonin through 5-HT2A receptors. It could be of great interest to determine if serotonin stimulates also the Jak/STAT pathway in these cells. Recently, a mouse 5-HT2B receptor transfected in fibroblasts was reported to induce serotonin stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (ERK2/ERK1) through the Ras pathway (6Launay J.-M. Birraux G. Bondoux D. Callebert J. Choi D.-S. Loric S. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3141-3147Google Scholar). Furthermore, serine/threonine phosphorylation mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases was shown to play a role in the activation of STATs, linking STAT and Ras pathways (25Zhang Z. Belnis J. Li H.C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Google Scholar, 29Lütticken C. Coffer D. Yuan J. Schwartz C. Caldenhoven E. Schindler C. Kruijer W. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 137-143Google Scholar). In conclusion, our results show that the Jak/STAT pathway is implicated in the serotonin-induced increase in mRNAs coding for proteins involved in myogenic differentiation, suggesting that this pathway may play a role in skeletal muscle ontogenesis, and (or) repairing. This novel localization and signal transduction for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors deserve further studies, in particular a search for implication of serotonin in excitation-contraction coupling.

In the HO-1 cDNA-transfected O2R95 cells, cellular heme was lowered compared with controls; however, cellular redox active iron levels were increased. We conclude that HO mediates cytoprotection to oxygen toxicity within a narrow range of expression.

However, it is not clear whether HO serves in protection against hyperoxia and, if so, by which mechanisms. HO-1 antisense transfection experiments have shown that higher HO-1 protein levels were associated with protection against UVA radiation (1Vile G.F. Basu-Modak S. Waltner C. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl.

Furthermore, transfection of coronary vessel endothelial cells with an overexpression vector containing HO-1 cDNA resulted in resistance against hemoglobin-induced injury (2Abraham N.G. Lavrovsky Y.

We have previously shown that HA-1 hamster fibroblasts made stably resistant to oxygen toxicity (O2R95) had 1.8-fold higher HO activity (3Dennery P.A. Wong H.E. Sridhar K.J. Rodgers P.A. Sim J.E. Spitz D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L672-L679Google Scholar), suggesting that moderate increases in HO activity may be beneficial in resistance to oxygen toxicity. However, O2R95 cells have increases in other antioxidants that may also contribute to their resistance to oxygen toxicity (4Sullivan S.J. Oberley T.D. Roberts R.J. Spitz D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L748-L756Google Scholar), and no direct evidence currently exists linking HO to resistance to oxygen toxicity.Investigators have hypothesized that HO may serve a role in protection against oxidative injury by forming the antioxidant molecules biliverdin and bilirubin (5Maines M.D. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Google Scholar, 6Llesuy S.F.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2607-2610Google Scholar). This could lead to sequestration of redox active iron, thereby conferring protection against oxidative stress (7Balla G. Jacob H.S.

This has lead to the hypothesis that reduction of the cellular heme pool by HO may diminish the interaction of heme with oxygen radicals or other reactive oxygen intermediates.To investigate mechanisms by which HO-1 plays a causal role in resistance to oxygen toxicity, we examined the effect of reducing or increasing HO activity in O2R95 cells in the absence of nonspecific effects on other antioxidants believed to provide protection from oxygen toxicity. This was achieved by transfection with antisense oligonucleotides to HO-1 and HO-1 cDNA in a pRC/cytomegalovirus (CMV) overexpression vector, respectively. All transfected cells were also evaluated for levels of major cellular antioxidants other than HO and were not shown to demonstrate nonspecific effects.Cells were then exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h, and cellular injury was measured by LDH release and Trypan Blue dye exclusion. Oxidative damage was assessed by measuring protein oxidation, glutathione depletion and susceptibility to lipid peroxidation as determined by formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS). The injury response of the antisense-transfected cells was then compared with that of O2R95 cells transfected with sense or random oligonucleotides. To further corroborate the causal role of HO-1 in hyperoxic resistance, oxygen-resistant cells were treated with tin-mesoporphyrin (SnMP), a competitive inhibitor of HO, and exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h. Cellular injury and oxidative injury parameters were also assessed and compared with controls not treated with SnMP.In all models of HO manipulation, the possible mechanism by which HO confers protection against oxygen toxicity were probed by comparing heme content and iron content of control and treated cells. This was done to determine whether accumulation of heme could explain increased oxidative injury when HO activity was suppressed and whether iron accumulation occurred with higher levels of HO activity.

Phenobarbital (PB) is an archetypal representative for chemicals including industrial solvents, pesticides, plant products, and clinically used drugs that induce several genes within CYP subfamilies 2B, 2A, 2C, and 3A in rodents and humans. Although the transcription of these CYP genes is activated by PB, the associated molecular mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. Here we have analyzed, in detail, enhancer activity of a far upstream region of mouse Cyp2b10 gene and report a 132-base pair PB-responsiveenhancer module (PBREM) with a 33-base pair core element containing binding sites for nuclear factor I- and nuclear receptor-like factors. Mutations of these binding sites abolish the ability of PBREM to respond to inducers in mouse primary hepatocytes.

Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Google Scholar) with diverse functions from the synthesis and degradation of steroid hormones and fatty acid derivatives to metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals such as drugs, industrial chemicals, environmental pollutants, and carcinogens (2Waterman M. John M.E. Simpson E.R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry.Plenum Press. 1986; : 345-386Google Scholar, 3Escalente B. Erlij D. Falck J.R. McGiff J.C.

Induction of P450s by xenobiotic chemicals is a common phenomenon, conserved throughout the vertebrate kingdom, insects, and bacteria. Xenobiotic inducers can be sorted into distinct classes based on the subsets of P450s induced (6Snyder R. Remmer H. Pharmacol. & Ther. 1979; 7: 203-244Google Scholar, 7Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 333-369Google Scholar); for instance, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and peroxisome proliferators are known to activateCYP1A and CYP4A genes through ligand-dependent aryl hydrocarbon and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, respectively (7Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 333-369Google Scholar, 8Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.-H. Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18083-18089Google Scholar). For many otherCYP genes and the majority of xenobiotics, however, the molecular basis of induction is virtually unknown (1Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Google Scholar, 7Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 333-369Google Scholar, 9Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13469-13472Google Scholar). Phenobarbital (PB) represents a large number of structurally unrelated chemicals that induce the same set of CYP genes including members within subfamilies 2A, 2B, 2C, and 3A, with CYP2Bforms being activated most effectively (for review, see Ref. 10Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-582Google Scholar). PB also induces various transferases and enzymes of heme metabolism and affects processes of cell growth and cell-cell communication (10Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-582Google Scholar). The signaling pathways through which PB acts to regulate the induction process of CYP genes are mostly unknown due to the loss of PB response in hepatoma cells and the lack of other reliable in vitro assays. Also, the findings on PB-responsive DNA regulatory elements of these CYP genes have been quite inconsistent (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar, 12Ramsden R. Sommer K. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar, 13Fournier T. Medjoubi N. Lapoumaroulie C. Hamelin J. Elion J.

Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar). We have addressed the above problems by developing a primary hepatocyte culture in which both endogenous and transfectedCyp2b10 genes remain transcriptionally inducible by PB-like chemicals (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Using this culture system, we now identify and dissect a PB-responsive enhancer module PBREM from the mouse Cyp2b10gene and show that binding sites for both nuclear factor I- and nuclear receptor-like factors are involved in induction. The 177-bp Cyp2b10 DNA fragment (−2426/−2250 bp) from plasmid BglPst4 (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) was amplified using primers 2B10-S (5′ cagggatccTGTCTGGATCAGGACACA) and 2B10-AS (5′ cagggatccTCAGTGCCAGATCAACCA). Cyp2b9 gene DNA fragment (−898/−765 bp) (18Lakso M. Masaki R. Noshiro M. Negishi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 477-486Google Scholar) was amplified from BamHI-digested CD-1 mouse genomic DNA (2 μg) with primers 2B9-S (5′ cttggatccATTAAAATCTGGTTACCAAGGAGGAAGAAAAGA) and 2B9-AS (5′ cttggatccCCAGCTTTGCAGGAGCAAAATCCTGGTGTCATT). The amplified DNAs were digested with BamHI and ligated into BamHI site of pBLCAT2 (tkCAT) plasmid (19Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). Various deletions ofCyp2b10 177-bp fragment (depicted in Fig. 3) were done using appropriate 20–24-mer primers harboring a BamHI site at 5′-ends for cloning as above. Internal deletions of elements pB′ and pC were generated using primers 2B10-S, 2B10-AS, and 20-mer primers with a 5′-end EcoRI site annealing to elements pB, pB′, pC, and pD. In wild-type Cyp2b10 fragment, this resulted in a 3-bp mutation (−2336 GTACTT to GaAtTc) without any change in the spacing between elements pB′ and pC. All mutations from the wild-type sequence shown hereafter are indicated by underlined, lowercase characters. To expedite the mutation of pC, the spacer region between pC and pD was first changed to an XbaI site (−2298 GCCTGA to tCtaGA), and pC was then mutated by changing six nucleotides from Cyp2b10 sequence to those in corresponding Cyp2b9 position by primer MUT-pC (−799 ctgtctagaAAGTcctTGaTGGCACTGTGtCAAGaTCAGGAAA). Mutagenesis of the minimal enhancer construct pB′-C (−2364/−2297) were done using primers B′-mut1 (−2364 ctgggatccAAACATGGTacagTCGGGCACA), B′-mut2 (−2364 ctgggatccAAACATGGTGATTTCGGtactAGAATCTGT), pC-NFIm (−2297 ctgggatccGCAAGTTGATGcatagACTGTGCCAA), and pC-NRm (−2297 ctgggatccGCAAGTTGATGGTGGCACTGTGCCAAccagAAGAAAGTAC). Plasmids −4300CAT, −1404CAT, and −566CAT were described previously (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Plasmid −2397CAT was constructed by amplifying theCyp2b10 region between −2397 and −1404 bp using proof-reading PfuDNA polymerase and primers containingHindIII sites. The amplified DNA was inserted intoHindIII-digested −4300CAT plasmid. Plasmid −1850CAT was generated from −4300CAT by partial PvuII digestion and self-ligation. Appropriate recombinant plasmid DNAs produced inEscherichia coli TG-1 cells were purified twice on CsCl gradients and verified by DNA sequencing over the amplified regions. The quality and supercoiling of plasmid DNAs were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Two-month-old C57BL/6 males were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, MA). About 25 × 106mouse hepatocytes were electroporated with 30 μg each of individual enhancer/tkCAT reporter plasmids including 10 μg of pSVβgal control plasmid (Promega) to normalize results between different plasmid DNAs as described previously (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Equal aliquots from a transfected cell pool were dispensed into four 60-mm dishes to assure identical transfection efficiencies among treatments (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar), unattached cells were removed after 30 min, and dishes (about 3 × 106cells) were incubated with or without inducers for 24 h in Williams' E-based medium (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) with supplemental 30 mmpyruvate. Cell extracts (20Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.P. Guerin S.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Google Scholar) were assayed for protein (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase (22Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Google Scholar), heat-treated for 20 min and assayed for CAT activity (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar), and quantitated by radioisotope imager (Molecular Dynamics). Generally, cell aliquots from the same batch of isolation gave very similar transfection efficiencies as determined from pilot experiments with pSVCAT and pSVβgal control plasmids, as also found by other investigators using electroporation (23LeCam A. Pantescu V. Paquereau L. Legraverend C. Fauconnier G. Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21532-21539Google Scholar). For mRNA analyses, cells were lysed using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) after 8 h of treatment, and total RNA samples (10 μg) were subjected to Northern blot analysis with 32P-labeled 360-bp CYP2B10 and 180-bp mouse albumin cDNA probes (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Crude nuclear extracts (24Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 777-781Google Scholar) from control and PB-treated mouse livers were enriched through heparin-agarose columns to remove endogenous DNase activity (25Yoshioka H. Lang M.A. Wong G. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14612-14617Google Scholar). DNase I protection assays were performed with 32P-end-labeled 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA fragments or pB′-C variants (5 × 104 cpm/lane), enriched nuclear extracts (up to 10 μg) and DNase I (0.5 units) adjusted to equal total protein with bovine serum albumin, incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and processed as before (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Gel shift assays were performed using 3 μg of crude nuclear extract in 10 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 2 μg poly(dI-dC), 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmNaCl, and about 30,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The free and protein-bound probes were separated on 5% acrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer prior to autoradiography. The top strands of the probes used were: PBRE, 5′ TTAGCAAGAGGGAAGGTCAGAGAAC; PBRE NRm, 5′ TTAGCAAGAGGGAAccTCAGAGAAC; pC wt, 5′ TACTTTCCTGACCTTGGCACAGTGCCACCATCAACTTG; pC NFIm, 5′ TACTTTCCTGACCTTGGCACAGTctatgCATCAACTTG; pC NRm, 5′ TACTTTCCTGAggTTGGCACAGTGCCACCATCAACTTG; and pC dm, 5′ TACTTTCCTGAggTTGGCACAGTctatgCATCAACTTG. Our previous reporter gene assays using various deletion constructs of the Cyp2b10 gene indicated that induction of CAT activity was 2–3-fold when using either −4300CAT or −1404CAT plasmids. The inducibility was lost and the basal CAT activity increased more than 10-fold when sequences downstream of −775 bp were included (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by the experiments depicted in Fig. 1. −4300CAT gave 3.1-fold induction, close to previously observed values (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Notably, the CAT activity from −2397CAT plasmid was induced even further, by 7.6-fold in three different experiments with mouse primary hepatocytes. Removal of the −2397/−1850-bp or the −1850/−1404-bp DNA fragments attenuated the induction to 2.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively. The −566CAT plasmid produced high basal, non-inducible CAT activity as found before (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). These findings indicate that Cyp2b10 gene may contain two regions involved in PB induction, the previously described −1404/−971-bp region (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) and the stronger −2397/−1850-bp region. Trottier et al. (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar) showed that a 163-bpSau3AI-Sau3AI fragment within the −2.3-kb region of the rat CYP2B2 gene conferred a 3.5–6.6-fold PB inducibility to a tkCAT reporter in rat hepatocytes, but no further analysis of this enhancer or its associated factors was reported (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar). Since we found that the −2397/−1850-bp Cyp2b10 DNA fragment mediated PB induction and contains sequences overlapping with the rat 163-bp fragment, we cloned the DNA homologous to the rat 163-bp sequence from the mouse Cyp2b10 gene and found that its identity to CYP2B2 163-bp fragment is 91%, which is higher than the overall 83% identity in 5′-flanking region (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). The corresponding fragment from non-inducible mouse Cyp2b9 gene exhibited a lower 70% identity (Fig. 2 A). We then performed DNase I protection assays with the 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA and identified three weakly protected (pA, pB, and pB′) and three strongly protected (pC, pD, and pE) nuclear protein binding regions (Fig. 2 B; also see Fig. 2 A,bracketed areas). None of these six regions displayed any noticeable differences in binding patterns between control and PB-treated mouse nuclear extracts in gel shift assays (Fig.2 C) or in footprint assays (not shown). These findings suggest that pre-existing DNA-binding factors are being modified in response to PB or that if distinct DNA-binding species activated by PB really exist, they are not detectable by the DNA and oligonucleotide probes used here. We then examined whether this Cyp2b10 DNA had any PB-inducible enhancer activity in mouse primary hepatocytes. Fig.3 A, top panel, shows that the endogenous CYP2B10 mRNA was strongly increased by PB (lane 2) and TCPOBOP (lane 4) but not by 3,3′-DCP (lane 3), which is an inactive TCPOBOP derivative (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar, 26Kende A.S. Ebetino F.H. Drendel W.B. Sundaralingam M. Glover E. Poland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 445-453Google Scholar). The mouse albumin mRNA, used as a control, did not respond to the inducers. The same pattern of induction by PB and TCPOBOP (≥ 11-fold) was conferred to the tk promoter by the insertion of 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA (Fig. 3 A, middle panel), whereas the tk promoter alone was not activated by any of the compounds (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). It is notable that the extent of induction was at least as high as with the −2397CAT construct in Fig. 1. Furthermore, the dose responses of the 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA-driven CAT activity paralleled that of endogenous CYP2B10 mRNA (Fig. 3 B). The maximal levels of CYP2B10 mRNA were achieved with 50 nm TCPOBOP and 0.3 mm PB, which induced CAT activity 6.0- and 8.6-fold, respectively. These results indicate that the mouse 177-bp DNA sequence acts as a PB-responsive enhancer with the same chemical specificity and dose-responsiveness as the endogenous Cyp2b10 gene. These data strongly suggest that the 177-bp DNA element mediates PB inductionin vivo. Since there were at least six DNA regions capable of nuclear protein binding within the 177-bp DNA sequence, we next determined their functional role for PB inducibility. Primary hepatocytes were transfected with various DNA deletions linked to tkCAT reporter plasmid (Fig.4). The deletion of pA had only slight effects on the basal activity or inducibility (compare lanes 1and2, and 5 and 7). Depending on the presence of other elements, the deletion of pE tended to decrease the inducibility by elevating the basal activity about 2-fold at most (compare lanes 1 and 4, and 2 and6). Due to high basal activity of construct −2364/−2250 (lane 3), deletion of pE in this case actually increased the -fold inducibility (compare lanes 3 and 8). The simultaneous removal of pA and pE decreased the inducibility only by 25% (compare lanes 1 and 7). These results suggest that the elements pA and pE do not have a major role in the function of the 177-bp Cyp2b10 enhancer. The removal of pB attenuated the induction response by 40–60%, mostly due to increases in the basal CAT activity (e.g. compare lanes 2and 3, and 7 and 9). The deletion of pD also attenuated the induction response by 25–50% due to decreases in induced CAT activity but without affecting the basal levels (compare lanes 4 and 5, 6 and7, and 8 and 9). Finally, the construct −2364/−2297 reproducibly displayed about 3-fold induction indicating that regions pB′ plus pC harbored the inducer-dependent DNA segment (lane 9). However, neither pB′ nor pC alone could confer any significant inducibility to the tk promoter (Fig. 4, lanes 10 and11), suggesting that sequences within both regions are required for induction response. When multimerized DNA fragments were inserted in front of the tk promoter, CAT activity was induced about 2-fold with pC but less with pB′ (lanes 12and13). Although the extent of induction was too low to draw a definite conclusion, pC appeared to have a more central role than pB′ in the observed enhancer activity of the pB′-C construct. Consistent with this notion, the most dramatic loss of inducibility (from 6.8- to 1.4-fold) was observed when pC was deleted from the 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA (lanes 14 and 16). The importance of pB′ for enhancer activity was also confirmed by the fact that deletion of pB′ attenuated the induction to 2.1-fold (lane 15). In addition to these results, we found that the 177-bpCyp2b10 DNA conferred PB inducibility also to SV40 and proximal Cyp2b10 (−64CAT) (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) promoters, regardless of its orientation or distance from promoter (data not shown), indicating that the 177-bp Cyp2b10 DNA is a functional enhancer. In summary, our data suggest that pC and pB′ have a major role in determining the inducibility while pB and pD also contribute to the full enhancer activity by modulating the basal and PB-induced activity levels, respectively. Because of this multifactorial nature, we designate the 132-bp Cyp2b10 fragment (−2397/−2265 bp) as thePhenobarbital ResponsiveEnhancer Module (PBREM). The mouse Cyp2b9 gene encodes the female-specific steroid 16α-hydroxylase (18Lakso M. Masaki R. Noshiro M. Negishi M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 477-486Google Scholar), which is related to Cyp2b10 but not induced by PB (27Honkakoski P. Kojo A. Lang M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 979-983Google Scholar). The DNA sequence most similar to PBREM was amplified from the Cyp2b9 gene, linked into tkCAT plasmid, and transfected into mouse hepatocytes. As compared with theCyp2b10 PBREM, the Cyp2b9-derived DNA sequence could not confer any inducibility to the tk promoter-driven CAT activity, indicating that Cyp2b10 PBREM displays the predicted genetic specificity of induction (compare PBREM andCyp2b9 in Fig. 5, A andB). Additionally, the Cyp2b9-driven CAT activity was not increased more than 1.4-fold by TCPOBOP, 3,3′-DCP, or PB (data not shown). Considering these findings and the key role of pC in PBREM function, the sequence of pC was mutated by converting six nucleotides to those in the Cyp2b9 gene while keeping the protected elements pB, pB′, and pD in the Cyp2b10 gene intact. For easier cloning, this was done by first changing the spacer region between pC and pD into an XbaI site, which did not affect the inducibility (PBREM-Xba in Fig. 5, A and B). The subsequent replacement of six nucleotides in Cyp2b10 pC element by corresponding nucleotides in Cyp2b9 gene resulted in the loss of induction of CAT activity (PBREM-mut pC in Fig. 5,A and B), underscoring the importance of pC as the core inducible element within PBREM. The nucleotide sequence of the 33-bp pC fragment contained a perfect nuclear factor I (NFI) binding site (TGGN7CCA) and a putative nuclear receptor (NR) binding motif (AGGTCA). Intriguingly, both binding sites are mutated in the noninducible Cyp2b9 gene, the 5′ NFI motif TGG to TGa, and the NR motif AGGTCA to AGaTCA (Fig.2 A). We mutated the NFI and NR binding sites within the minimal inducible fragment pB′-C (−2364/−2297) and examined how these mutations affected binding of nuclear proteins and inducibility of CAT reporter activity. Fig. 6, A and B indicate that nucleotides including NFI and NR motifs between −2326 and −2300 on top strand (upper panel) and between −2333 and −2304 on bottom strand (lower panel) were protected from DNase I digestion in the wild-type pB′-C DNA. Binding to NFI site was dramatically decreased in pC NFI mutant (−2312 GCCAC toctatg) so that now only NR motif and seven adjoining nucleotides were protected. In addition, a DNase I hypersensitive site appeared at −2310/−2313, just downstream from the NR site (Fig. 6,A and B, solid arrows). Mutation of the NR site (AGGTCA to AccagA) did not affect NFI binding but somewhat reduced the extent of protection at 5′ end of pC at −2332, −2329, and −2326 (Fig. 6, A and B). Thus, the patterns of nuclear protein binding to pC were altered by NFI and NR mutations, whereas a mutation at pB′ had no effect on protection of pC. The altered binding patterns were also confirmed in gel shift assays. Previously, we identified a 25-bp DNA element (−1219/−1195) highly similar to a portion of the 163-bp CYP2B2 fragment identified by Trottier et al. (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar, 17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). This 25-bp probe, here termed PBRE, formed two complexes with liver nuclear extracts (Fig.6 C, lane 1), which could be competed by 50-fold excess of either PBRE or pC oligonucleotides (lanes 2 and4) but not by oligonucleotides containing mutations at NR motifs (lanes 3 and 5). In line with the DNase I protection assay, mutation of NFI motif considerably reduced binding to pC, and the major remaining complex now comigrated with the top PBRE complex (compare lanes 6 and 8). When both NFI and NR motifs were mutated from the pC probe, this major complex disappeared (compare lanes 6and 7). In competition experiments, 50-fold excess of PBRE competed for the formation of faster-migrating complexes of pC which were also abolished by mutation of NR motif in pC (lanes 9–11). Finally, the binding to pC NFI mutant harboring an intact NR site could be competed relatively efficiently by PBRE (lanes 12–14). These results indicate that pC and PBRE appear to bind similar factors, that pC can bind both NFI-like and NR-like factors, and the binding of NR-like factors are dependent on the integrity of the AGGTCA motif. The same mutated DNA fragments used for DNase I protection were used in CAT reporter gene assays (Fig. 7). In five independent transfections, the mutation of NFI binding site reduced the basal CAT activity to 63% and abolished the induction (pC NFIm). The mutation of the NR site increased the basal activity to 221%, but the inducibility was again lost (pC NRm). Mutations of a putative D-binding protein site within pB′ reduced the basal activity but had smaller effects on the induction response (pB′mut1, pB′mut2), confirming the principal role of pC as the core enhancer element. These results are consistent with pC being occupied by at least two factors, NFI- and NR-like proteins. Although both sites are needed to confer inducibility to the minimal pB′-C construct, they appear functionally different, with NFI-like protein acting as an activator and NR-like protein as a repressor, respectively. The barbiturate-regulated induction mechanism of bacterialCYP102 gene is well characterized, with a 17-bp so called Barbie box sequence as the cis-acting element (14He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Google Scholar, 28Liang Q. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18606-18614Google Scholar). The nature of PB-dependent regulatory elements of mammalianCYP genes, on the other hand, has been very controversial. Some studies indicated that Barbie box-like sequences are present in PB-inducible mammalian gene promoters (at −136/−127 bp in rat α1-acid glycoprotein gene and at −89/−73 bp inCYP2B2 gene) and that they bind nuclear proteins in a PB-dependent manner (13Fournier T. Medjoubi N. Lapoumaroulie C. Hamelin J. Elion J. Durand G. Porquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27175-27178Google Scholar, 14He J.-S. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7864-7869Google Scholar). Similar results were reported with CYP2B2 sequences (−98/−68 bp) overlapping the Barbie box (29Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar). Another group found that the CYP2B2 Barbie box was not protected, and two elements at −199/−183 bp and at −72/−31 bp formed nuclear protein complexes that were more abundant after PB administration (15Shephard E.A. Forrest L.A. Shervington A. Fernandez L.M. Ciaramella G. Phillips I.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 793-804Google Scholar). However, these studies have relied mainly onin vitro protein binding or in vitrotranscription experiments. Only one report showed that mutation of the Barbie box eliminated the 1.6-fold induction by PB of rat α1-acid glycoprotein promoter-driven reporter gene in primary hepatocytes (13Fournier T. Medjoubi N. Lapoumaroulie C. Hamelin J. Elion J. Durand G. Porquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27175-27178Google Scholar). Several groups have documented that nuclear proteins do not bind to Barbie box-like sequences in α1-acid glycoprotein (30Lee Y.-M. Tsai W.-H. Lai M.-Y. Chen D.-S. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 432-442Google Scholar,31Ratajczak T. Williams P.M. DiLorenzo D. Ringold G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11111-11119Google Scholar) or in mouse (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) and rat CYP2B genes (15Shephard E.A. Forrest L.A. Shervington A. Fernandez L.M. Ciaramella G. Phillips I.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 793-804Google Scholar, 32Luc P.-V.T. Adesnik M. Ganguly S. Shaw P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 345-356Google Scholar, 33Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 693-701Google Scholar). Consistent with the absence of any significant protein binding, we found, using DNA transfection assays in primary hepatocytes, that Barbie box-like sequences did not have a major role in basal or PB-induced Cyp2b10 gene transcription (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Later on, it was shown that mutation of a Barbie box-like sequence in the proximalCYP2B2 promoter did not affect PB-inducibility of reporter gene DNA by in situ injection into rat liver (34Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Google Scholar). In contrast to somewhat variable results reported on the proximal regions of CYP2B genes (13Fournier T. Medjoubi N. Lapoumaroulie C. Hamelin J. Elion J. Durand G. Porquet D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27175-27178Google Scholar, 15Shephard E.A. Forrest L.A. Shervington A. Fernandez L.M. Ciaramella G. Phillips I.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 793-804Google Scholar, 16Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9628-9632Google Scholar), recent studies on transgenic mouse lines carrying either 19 or 0.8 kbp of CYP2B25′-flanking sequences (12Ramsden R. Sommer K. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar) and on transient transfections withCyp2b10 (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar) or CYP2B2 genes (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar, 34Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Google Scholar) suggest that PB responsiveness resides in the distal part of CYP2Bgenes. Transient transfections carried out with the Cyp2b10gene in the present study and functional studies utilizing different methodologies with the rat CYP2B2 gene (11Trottier E. Belzil A. Stoltz C. Anderson A. Gene. 1995; 158: 263-268Google Scholar, 34Park Y. Li H. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23725-23728Google Scholar) converge well together, indicating that a PB-responsive element is located around −2.3 kbp region of CYP2B genes. Notably, this region does not contain any Barbie box-like sequences. We have now identified, for the first time, the core PB-inducible element that appears to be a classical enhancer and provided some evidence for associated factors. Interestingly, we did not detect any differences in protein binding to PBREM between the control and PB-treated liver nuclear extracts. This implies that PB might act by modifying pre-existing DNA-binding factors, which is consistent with the insensitivity of CYP2B10 mRNA induction to inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide in this hepatocyte system (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Alternatively, PB might modify the function, affinity, and/or amount of factors associated with the pre-existing DNA-binding proteins. More importantly, we found that the core inducible element is capable of binding NFI- and NR-like factors, both necessary for induction response. We found that NFI and C/EBPα could bind to32P-labeled pC element in gel shift assays since antibodies raised against these transcription factors were able to supershift some of the pC complexes (data not shown). Our previous studies indicated that another PB-responsive element was located in the −1.4/−1.0-kbp region of Cyp2b10 gene although it could not confer PB-inducibility to heterologous promoters in primary hepatocytes (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). We found, however, that this element contained a 25-bp sequence (PBRE), which was very similar to a portion in the rat 163-bp CYP2B2gene fragment and contained an AGGTCA motif. We therefore proposed that a NR-like protein may have a role in PB induction of CYP2Bgenes (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). The PBRE also bears similarity to sequences within the present PBREM. It can be aligned with pB (at −2386/−2362 on top strand) but also with pC (at −2333/−2309 on bottom strand). According to our gel shift assays, factors binding to PBRE appear be related to those occupying the NR site within pC, the DNA region most important for PBREM function. The PB signal, activating the Cyp2b10 gene, may primarily target the NR-binding (repressor) factor rather than the NFI-like (activator) protein for several reasons. First, NFI isoforms are ubiquitous and present in many tissues and cell lines (35Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Google Scholar), whereas theCyp2b10 gene induction is liver-specific (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar). Second, NFI binding sites are present, e.g. in mouse albumin (36Izban M.G. Papaconstantinou J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9171-9179Google Scholar), rat tyrosine aminotransferase (37Oddos J. Grange T. Carr K.D. Matthews B. Roux J. Richard-Foy H. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8877-8878Google Scholar), rat CYP2A2 (38Matsunaga T. Nomoto M. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1329-1341Google Scholar), and mouseCyp2d9 (39Wong G. Itakura T. Kawajiri K. Skow L. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2920-2927Google Scholar) gene promoters, and none of these genes is PB-inducible (17Honkakoski P. Moore R. Gynther J. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9746-9753Google Scholar, 40Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12762-12773Google Scholar, 38Matsunaga T. Nomoto M. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1329-1341Google Scholar, 27Honkakoski P. Kojo A. Lang M.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 979-983Google Scholar). Third, in our unpublished experiments, 2P. Honkakoski and M. Negishi, unpublished results. the PBREM-driven CAT activity was found to be quite high and non-inducible in several continuous cell lines. It may be speculated that the NR-like repressor protein, critical for induction, is missing or inactive in these cell lines. However, as our transfection assays indicate, both NFI-like and NR-like factors are important for the function of PBREM and identification of both factors in further studies is required to elucidate their respective roles in PB-induced gene expression. While the sequence and function of PBREM are well conserved between the rat and mouse CYP2B genes, we did not find identical or highly similar sequences in the reported sequences of PB-inducible genes within families CYP2A, CYP2C, andCYP3A. This may be related to the fact that CYP2Bforms are also the most efficiently induced by PB (7Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 333-369Google Scholar, 10Waxman D.J. Azaroff L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 577-582Google Scholar). Presuming a key role for a NR-like protein in PB induction, it is possible that divergence of DNA elements such as PBREM in CYP2B genes has resulted in substitution of the NFI site by other CCAAT-like sequences such as C/EBP, CP2, or CP1 sites (35Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Google Scholar) or by other transcription factor sites, leading to different organization and perhaps to different efficiency of these DNA elements in other PB-responsive CYPgenes. In this view, we found elements composed of NR- and CCAAT-like binding sites at −2.7/−2.6 and −1.0/−0.9 kbp in CYP2A1gene (38Matsunaga T. Nomoto M. Kozak C.A. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1329-1341Google Scholar); at −2.25/−2.1 kbp, close to a DNase I hypersensitive site in CYP2C1 gene (41Kim J. Kemper B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10287-10294Google Scholar); at −2.2 kbp in CYP2C8 gene (42Ged C. Beaune P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1088: 433-435Google Scholar), and at −0.65 and −0.15 kbp in CYP3A genes (43Telhada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Google Scholar, 44Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Google Scholar). The functional role of these elements, reminiscent of PBREM in these PB-inducible genes, remains to be tested. As a pleiotropic inducer, PB may alter gene functions through different pathways and regulatory mechanisms. In this respect, and given the sequence divergence discussed above, it is noteworthy that the extent and kinetics of induction among the PB-responsive genes have been reported to differ (45Kocarek T.A. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 440-444Google Scholar, 46Honkakoski P. Auriola S. Lang M.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 2121-2128Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have characterized and dissected a multifactorial PB-responsive enhancer at −2.3 kbp in mouse Cyp2b10 gene in primary hepatocytes. In transient transfection assays, the enhancer responds to inducers with identical chemical specificity as the endogenous Cyp2b10 gene. The inducibility of the enhancer is lost by introduction of naturally occurring mutations from the non-inducible Cyp2b9 gene. The function of the enhancer is dependent on the integrity of both nuclear factor I- and nuclear receptor-like sites within a 33-bp core element. Further analysis of PBREM and its binding proteins will provide a central framework that may apply to many other PB-inducible genes.

https://openalex.org/W2035207190,"Oxygen is an important environmental regulator for the transcription of several genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it is not yet clear how this yeast or other eukaryotes actually sense oxygen. To begin to address this we have examined the effects of oxygen concentration on the expression of several nuclear genes (CYC1, CYC7,COX4, COX5a, COX5b,COX6, COX7, COX8, andCOX9) for proteins of the terminal portion of the respiratory chain. COX5b and CYC7 are hypoxic genes; the rest are aerobic genes. We have found that the level of expression of these genes is determined by oxygen concentrationper se and not merely the presence or absence of oxygen and that each of these genes has a low oxygen threshold (0.5–1 μm O2) for expression. For some aerobic genes (COX4, COX5a, COX7,COX8, and COX9) there is a gradual decline in expression between 200 μm O2 (air) and their oxygen threshold. Below this threshold expression drops precipitously. For others (COX5a and CYC1) the level of expression is nearly constant between 200 μmO2 and their threshold and then drops off. The hypoxic genes COX5b and CYC7 are not expressed until the oxygen concentration is below 0.5 μm O2. These studies have also revealed that COX5a andCYC1, the genes for the aerobic isoforms of cytochromec oxidase subunit V and cytochrome c, andCOX5b and CYC7, the genes for the hypoxic isoforms of cytochrome c oxidase subunit V and cytochromec, are coexpressed at a variety of oxygen concentrations and switch on or off at extremely low oxygen concentrations. By shifting cells from one oxygen concentration to another we have found that aerobic genes are induced faster than hypoxic genes and that transcripts from both types of gene are turned over quickly. These findings have important implications for cytochrome coxidase function and biogenesis and for models of oxygen sensing in yeast.

By shifting cells from one oxygen concentration to another we have found that aerobic genes are induced faster than hypoxic genes and that transcripts from both types of gene are turned over quickly. These findings have important implications for cytochrome coxidase function and biogenesis and for models of oxygen sensing in yeast. The intracellular levels and activities of a large number of proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are affected by oxygen tension (1Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 2Poyton R.O. Burke P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 252-256Google Scholar, 3Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar). Many of these proteins are involved in metabolic pathways or processes that use oxygen or reactive oxygen species as substrates. They include: cytochromes of the respiratory chain; enzymes involved in the synthesis of heme, sterols, or unsaturated fatty acids; and enzymes that function in the oxidative stress response (1Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar, 3Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar). The effects of oxygen on the intracellular levels of many of these proteins have been shown to be exerted through the transcription of their genes. Most of these oxygen-regulated genes can be placed into one of two groups: aerobic genes, which are transcribed optimally in the presence of air; and hypoxic genes, which are transcribed optimally under anoxic or microaerophilic conditions. It is not yet clear how oxygen is sensed in yeast and most other eukaryotes (3Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar). Also unclear is how an “oxygen sensor” transmits its signal to a signal transduction pathway for the activation or repression of oxygen-responsive genes and whether there is more than one signal transduction pathway involved in oxygen-regulated transcription. Most previous studies on oxygen-regulated gene expression in yeast have been done with cells grown either aerobically or anaerobically or with hem1 mutant cells grown either in the presence or absence δ-aminolevulinate. These studies have revealed that some genes are down-regulated in the absence of oxygen (or δ-aminolevulinate), and others are up-regulated (1Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Google Scholar). Although these studies have been useful in identifying some of the molecular components that are involved in oxygen-regulated gene expression they have not provided insight concerning how cells actually sense different oxygen concentrations. One obvious question raised by these studies is whether oxygen-regulated genes respond in an “all-or-none” fashion to the presence of oxygen or whether they respond in a graded fashion to different oxygen concentrations. The dose-response effects of oxygen on the expression of the genes for cytochrome c oxidase are especially interesting because as a major consumer of oxygen (4Wikstrom M. Krab K. Saraste M. Cytochrome c Oxidase: A Synthesis.Academic Press. 1981; Google Scholar) this enzyme plays an important role in determining the rate of energy production in yeast and other eukaryotes (5Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Google Scholar, 6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Google Scholar). Yeast cytochrome c oxidase contains polypeptide subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes (6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Google Scholar, 7Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Google Scholar). The three largest subunits (I, II, and III) are encoded by mitochondrial genes (COX1, COX2, and COX3); these perform the catalytic functions of the holoenzyme (5Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Google Scholar, 6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Google Scholar, 7Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A.

Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar). The other subunit polypeptides are encoded by nuclear genes; some of these modulate catalysis, whereas others function in the assembly or stability of the holoenzyme (6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Google Scholar, 7Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Google Scholar). Active preparations of yeast cytochrome c oxidase contain at least six subunits (IV, Va or Vb, VI, VII, VIIa, and VIII) encoded by the nuclear COXgenes (COX4, COX5a or COX5b,COX6, COX7, COX9, and COX8, respectively) (6Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Google Scholar, 7Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Google Scholar). COX5a and COX5b encode interchangeable isoforms, Va and Vb, of subunit V (5Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Google Scholar, 9Cumsky M.G. Ko C. Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2235-2239Google Scholar, 10Cumsky M.G. Trueblood C.E. Ko C. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell.

All of these genes, exceptCOX5b, are aerobic genes (2Poyton R.O. Burke P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 252-256Google Scholar, 3Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Google Scholar). Because COX5a is an aerobic gene and COX5b is a hypoxic gene, the expression of the subunit V isoforms, Va and Vb, is inversely regulated by oxygen tension (5Poyton R.O. Trueblood C.E. Wright R.M. Farrell L.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 289-307Google Scholar, 12Hodge M.R. Kim G. Singh K. Cumsky M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1958-1964Google Scholar). The differential effects of oxygen on the expression of Va and Vb are especially interesting because these isoforms have differential effects on holoenzyme activity (13Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Google Scholar, 14Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Google Scholar). The turnover number (TN) 1The abbreviations used are: TN, turnover number; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; bp, base pair. of the Vb isozyme is 3–4-fold higher than TN of the Va isozyme (13Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Google Scholar). This is attributable to an alteration in the rates of intramolecular electron transfer from heme a to heme a3 and an alteration in the conformation of the binuclear reaction center (13Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Google Scholar, 14Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Google Scholar). Hence, these subunit isoforms allow cells to assemble functionally different types of holoenzyme molecules in response to oxygen concentration. Yeast cytochrome c, which transfers electrons to cytochromec oxidase, also has two isoforms, iso-1 and iso-2-cytochromec, encoded by the nuclear CYC1 andCYC7 genes, respectively (15Laz T.M. Pietras D.F. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4475-4479Google Scholar). CYC1 is an aerobic gene, and CYC7 is a hypoxic gene (2Poyton R.O. Burke P.V. Biochim. Biophys.

In vitrokinetic studies have revealed that the aerobic and hypoxic isoforms of cytochrome c and subunit V act synergistically (14Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Google Scholar). This has lead to the suggestion that the gene pairsCYC1/COX5a and CYC7/COX5bcoevolved to minimize differences in electron transfer rates through the terminal portion of the respiratory chain in cells grown at different oxygen concentrations (14Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Google Scholar). To begin to understand how yeast cells sense oxygen we have examined how oxygen concentration affects the expression of CYC and nuclear COX genes. We ask here if expression depends linearly on oxygen concentration or if instead expression changes at particular oxygen thresholds. We also examine the expression of the gene pairs CYC1/COX5a andCYC7/COX5b to determine if they are coexpressed at a variety of different oxygen concentrations. Finally, we examine the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of transcripts after cells are shifted from one oxygen concentration to another. The yeast strain JM43 (MATa leu-3, 112 his4–580, trp1–289 ura3–52) used in this study has been described previously (9Cumsky M.G. Ko C. Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2235-2239Google Scholar). This strain was chosen because it has a high level of expression of respiratory protein genes as judged by its respiration rate (11Trueblood C.T. Poyton R.O.

Cells were grown in a semisynthetic medium, SSG (per liter: 3 g of Bacto yeast extract, 10 g of galactose, 0.8 g of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 0.7 g of MgSO4.7H2O, 5 mg of FeCl3, 0.4 g of CaCl2) supplemented with 40 μg/ml leucine, histidine, tryptophan, and uracil; 0.1% Tween 80 (v/v); 20 μg/ml ergosterol; and 350 ppm Dow Corning FG-10 Silicone antifoam. Cells were grown in different gas mixtures in a New Brunswick BioFloIIc fermentor. Liquid cultures used as inocula for the fermentor were grown aerobically at 28 °C with shaking (200 rpm). Once cells reached mid-logarithmic phase they were inoculated into the fermentor at a low density and grown, for five to seven mass doublings, to early to mid-log phase. Cells were harvested when the dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermentor dropped to 80% of its initial value. This 20% decrease was chosen to allow the same criterion to be used at high and very low oxygen concentrations, where the total oxygen probe current was small. The fermentor had a working volume of 3.5 liters and was set up to maintain a pH of 5.0, a temperature of 28 °C, and an agitation rate of 300 rpm. Gas flow was adjusted with both manual flow meters and a mass flow meter; flow was maintained at 4 liters/min. Dissolved oxygen concentration was monitored with an Ingold polarographic oxygen probe attached to an Ingold 4300 transmitter. Data were recorded on a Yokogawa model 4156 chart recorder and by hand. In some experiments with low oxygen feed gases, agitation was increased to maintain dissolved oxygen concentration at or above 80% of the initial value. Prior to harvest, cells were chilled quickly by passage through a cooling coil/salted ice bath into chilled centrifuge bottles. They were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with distilled water. During anaerobic fermentations the vessel was covered with aluminum foil to prevent photoinhibition of anaerobic cells (19Sulkowski E. Guerin B. Defaye J. Slonimski P.P. Nature. 1964; 202: 36-39Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from washed cells essentially as described (20Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Google Scholar). RNA samples were separated on 0.22 m formaldehyde-agarose gels in a MOPS-formaldehyde buffer (0.02 m MOPS, 0.04 m sodium acetate, 0.008 m EDTA, 0.22 m formaldehyde) and transferred to Nytran or Nytran Plus (Schleicher & Schuell). Approximately 30 μg of total RNA was loaded per lane; loading was adjusted to give equal signals for hybridization to the ACT1gene. DNA probes were prepared by random primer labeling of double-stranded DNA fragments using [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN). Probes were an 800-bpXbaI fragment for COX4, a 500-bp PstI fragment for COX5a, a 370-bpAccI/BglII fragment for COX5b, a 500-bp StuI/BglII fragment for COX6, an 800-bp EcoRI fragment for COX7, a 370-bpXbaI/StyI fragment for COX8, a 240-bpClaI/NheI fragment for COX9, a 600-bpEcoRI/HindIII fragment for CYC1, a 400-bp KpuI/XhoI fragment for CYC7, and a 520-bp StyI fragment for ACT1. Hybridization and stringency washes were preformed as described previously (11Trueblood C.T. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3520-3526Google Scholar). Signal intensity was quantitated with an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging system. For quantitation of transcripts, signals were normalized to that for ACT1 mRNA. Galactose concentration in yeast culture filtrates was determined colorimetrically with o-toluidine. Toluidine reagent (6% (v/v) o-toluidine in glacial acetic acid with thiourea as stabilizer) was obtained from Sigma Chemicals. Five ml of toluidine reagent was mixed with 0.1 ml of cell culture filtrate, heated to boiling for 10 min, cooled quickly, and read atA635 against a water blank. Assays were done in triplicate, and galactose concentrations were calculated using a 0–1% galactose standard curve. The following Matheson gases or gas mixtures were obtained from U. S. Welding (Denver): O2-free nitrogen, 1% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen, 2.5% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen, 5% O2 in nitrogen, 10% O2 in nitrogen, and certified standards containing 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0% O2 in O2-free nitrogen. To examine the effects of oxygen on the expression of the CYC and nuclearCOX genes in S. cerevisiae it is necessary to use culture conditions where oxygen is the limiting nutrient and where the effects observed are due to oxygen concentration and not some other variable such as carbon source or growth rate. To assure that oxygen was the limiting nutrient in these studies, cells were grown in batch fermenter cultures sparged with feed gas mixtures that contained different fixed concentrations of oxygen, and growth was terminated when oxygen demand exceeded supply. This was signaled by a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration in the culture. To be able to use the same criterion for high and low oxygen concentrations, where the total current to the oxygen probe was small, we harvested cells when the dissolved oxygen in the culture decreased to 80% of the oxygen concentration in the feed gas mixture. This occurred in early to mid-log phase depending upon the oxygen concentration in the feed gas. Cell densities reached at 80% of the initial dissolved oxygen decreased as the oxygen concentration in the feed gas decreased (TableI). To ensure that cells were in steady-state growth we inoculated these batch fermenter cultures with an aliquot of an exponentially growing culture and adjusted the initial cell densities to allow for at least six mass doublings before harvest.Table ICell density at time of harvest for cells grown at various oxygen tensionsOxygen concentration in feed gasCell density at harvest1-aCells were harvested when the dissolved oxygen in the culture reached 80% of the oxygen concentration in the feed gas.%g wet weight/liter21 (air)5.155.612.00.51.00.10.30.050.10 (O2-free N2 + 2.5% CO2)5.11-a Cells were harvested when the dissolved oxygen in the culture reached 80% of the oxygen concentration in the feed gas. Open table in a new tab To minimize the effects of carbon source on the expression of theCYC and nuclear COX genes cells were grown on the nonrepressing carbon source, galactose. Because cells were harvested at low cell densities under our experimental conditions galactose concentration stayed nearly constant to the time of harvesting. For cells grown aerobically (air) or anaerobically (2.5% CO2in O2-free nitrogen) the galactose concentration declined only slightly, from a starting concentration of 1% (w/v) to a concentration of 0.7–0.8% (w/v), at the time of harvest. For cells grown at low to intermediate oxygen concentrations (i.e.0.5–100 μm O2) galactose concentration declined even less because cells were harvested at lower densities. These slight changes in galactose concentration do not affect the expression of the genes studied here as judged from two observations. First, we observed no difference in the level of expression ofCOX5a in cells harvested at earlier times (i.e.lower cell densities) when the galactose concentration was higher. Second, the expression of COX5a and CYC1 did not change in cells grown aerobically to higher cell densities, when the galactose concentration had declined to nearly 0.4–0.5% (w/v). These findings rule out galactose concentration as a variable that affects expression of the CYC or nuclear COX genes under our experimental conditions. The growth rate (expressed as mass doubling time) of strain JM43 in air is 2.7–2.8 h. Oxygen concentrations between 0.05 and 21% O2 (air) in the feed gas support equivalent rates of cell growth (data not shown). Surprisingly, we observed very slow growth rates (greater than an 8-h mass doubling time) with cells grown in O2-free nitrogen (i.e. anaerobic conditions) (Table II). We also observed that the growth rate in O2-free nitrogen was inversely proportional to the gas flow rate. This was surprising because it has been reported that nonsparged anaerobic cultures of S. cerevisiae grow at the same rate as aerobic cultures (21Criddle R.S. Schatz G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 322-334Google Scholar). To explain these observations we considered the possibility that carbon dioxide (CO2) was limiting in the nitrogen-sparged cultures. Although CO2 is not present initially in nonsparged cultures or in cultures that are sparged with O2-free nitrogen, it is produced metabolically by both types of culture. A feature that distinguishes nonsparged from sparged cultures is that CO2 is allowed to build up in nonsparged cultures but is blown off in sparged cultures. This could explain the slow growth observed in cultures sparged with O2-free nitrogen because sparging could result in a stripping of CO2 from the culture medium, preventing heterotrophic carbon dioxide fixation into the citric acid cycle, as observed previously for Escherichia coli (22Chen J. Tannahill A.L. Shuler M.L. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1985; 27: 151-155Google Scholar). To examine this possibility we added CO2 to the sparge gas and asked if the growth rate was increased. From Table II it is clear that a gas mixture containing 1% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen supports a growth rate twice that supported by O2-free nitrogen and that a gas mixture containing 2.5% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen supports a growth rate that is close to that supported by air. Therefore, for studies comparing expression ofCYC and the nuclear COX genes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions cells were grown anaerobically in a gas mixture containing 2.5% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen.Table IIEffect of CO2 supplementation on the growth rate of anaerobic cellsGasGrowth rate2-aMass doubling time.hO2-free N28.0 –9.0O2-free N2 + 1% CO24.2 –4.4O2-free N2 + 2.5% CO23.0 –3.2Air2.7 –2.82-a Mass doubling time. Open table in a new tab As a first step toward understanding how oxygen concentration affects the expression of oxygen-regulated genes we first determined the overall level of change in expression of the aerobic genes COX4, COX5a, COX6,COX7, COX8, COX9, CYC1, and the hypoxic genes COX5b and CYC7 in cells grown to steady state under aerobic conditions (i.e. air saturation, which corresponds to an oxygen concentration of 200 μm O2 at 28 °C and at the 1,350-m elevation of our laboratory in Boulder, CO) or anaerobic conditions (2.5% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen). RNA isolated from JM43 cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis using probes specific for each of the above mentioned genes as well asACT1, the actin gene. The ACT1 gene was used as an internal control for loading. From Fig. 1(lanes 1 and 5) it is clear that mRNA levels from all of these aerobic genes are reduced in anaerobic cells. Some of these aerobic genes (COX4, COX6, COX7,COX8, and CYC1) exhibit very little expression under anaerobic conditions, whereas others (COX5a andCOX9) have moderate levels of expression. When normalized toACT1 the level of expression of these genes varies from 3% (for CYC1) to 40% (for COX9) of their level in aerobically grown cells (Table III). It is also clear that the hypoxic genes COX5b and CYC7 are more tightly regulated by oxygen than the aerobic genes (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 5) (Table III). They are expressed under anaerobic conditions but are not detected in air.Table IIIExpression of CYC and nuclear COX genes under aerobic and anaerobic conditionsGeneRatio of gene transcript to ACT1 transcript3-aThe ratio for aerobic genes was normalized to a value of 1 for expression under aerobic conditions; the ratio for hypoxic genes was normalized to a value of 1 for expression under anaerobic conditions.Aerobic conditionsAnaerobic conditionsAerobic genesCOX410.07COX5a10.23COX610.31COX710.26COX810.25COX910.39CYC110.03Hypoxic genesCOX5bND3-bND, not detected.1CYC7ND13-a The ratio for aerobic genes was normalized to a value of 1 for expression under aerobic conditions; the ratio for hypoxic genes was normalized to a value of 1 for expression under anaerobic conditions.3-b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab To examine how oxygen concentration per seaffects the expression of CYC and nuclear COXgenes we first examined the level of gene expression in cells grown at oxygen concentrations, between 200 and 10 μmO2. From Figs. 1 and 2 it is clear that transcript levels for the aerobic genes COX4,COX5a, COX6, COX7, COX8,COX9, and CYC1 decrease relative to their aerobic levels in cells grown at 100, 50, and 10 μmO2. When normalized to ACT1 mRNA the levels of mRNA from all of the aerobic genes, except COX5a andCYC1, declined to about 40–70% of their aerobic levels at 100 μm and stayed nearly constant at oxygen concentrations between 100 and 10 μm O2 (Fig.2 A). In contrast, the mRNA levels from COX5aand CYC1 are nearly the same in cells grown in air, 100, 50, and 10 μm O2. These mRNAs are present at 85–95% of their aerobic levels in cells grown in 10 μmO2 (Fig. 2 B). From Figs. 1 and 2 B it is also clear that no transcripts from the hypoxic genes,COX5b and CYC7, are observed in cells grown at oxygen concentrations between 200 and 10 μmO2. Together, these findings indicate that there is a gradual decline in the mRNA levels from the aerobic genes in cells grown at oxygen concentrations between 100 and 10 μmO2 and imply that there is no threshold for expression for any of these genes in the oxygen concentration range between 200 and 10 μm O2. They also indicate that the hypoxic genes COX5b and CYC7 require an oxygen concentration below 10 μm O2 for expression. Given that major changes in mRNA levels occur in cells grown at oxygen concentrations below 10 μm O2, we next concentrated our studies on lower oxygen tensions. From the data shown in Fig. 3 it is clear that expression of all aerobic genes declined gradually in cells grown at oxygen concentrations between 10 and 1 μmO2; mRNA levels at 1 μm O2are about 40–66% of their mRNA levels in air (200 μm O2) (Fig. 3). At oxygen concentrations below 1 μm O2 the levels of expression ofCOX4, COX6, COX7, COX8, andCOX9 show a precipitous decline (Fig. 3 A). These findings suggest that 1 μm O2 is a threshold for expression of COX4, COX6, COX7,COX8, and COX9. In contrast to COX4,COX6, COX7, COX8, and COX9, the transcript levels from COX5a and CYC1show an sharp decline below 0.5 μm O2, instead of 1 μm O2 (Fig. 3 B). Hence, it appears that these two genes have a lower oxygen threshold than the other aerobic genes. The dose-response curves for the hypoxic genes COX5b andCYC7 are somewhat simpler than the curves for the aerobic genes. These genes are expressed anaerobically but are not expressed in cells grown at oxygen concentrations of 0.5 μmO2 or above (Fig. 3 B). Because 0.5 μm O2 is the lowest steady-state oxygen concentration for which we can harvest sufficient cells for RNA analysis we were unable to determine the expression behavior of these genes in steady-state cells grown at oxygen concentrations between 0 and 0.5 μm O2. Consequently, we were unable to determine the oxygen threshold for expression of these genes. As a second way of examining the effects of oxygen on transcript levels we performed shift experiments and followed the kinetics of induction of aerobic or hypoxic genes. Two kinds of shift experiments were done. Cells were shifted from anaerobic to aerobic conditions to follow the induction of aerobic genes and from aerobic to anaerobic conditions to follow the induction of hypoxic genes. In the first experiment cells were grown under anaerobic conditions (2.5% CO2 in O2-free nitrogen) for 6.4 generations, and then the sparge gas was changed to air. Upon shifting the cells from anaerobic to aerobic conditions the dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermentor increased rapidly, approaching a plateau within 5 min after the shift (Fig. 4). The mRNA levels for all of the aerobic genes (COX4, COX5a, COX6,COX7, COX8, COX9, and CYC1) increased immediately after the shift but exhibited different kinetics of induction (Fig. 4). Some of these genes were fully induced (i.e. to their levels in steady-state aerobic cells) quickly, and others were induced more slowly. Those genes that were induced quickly include CYC1 and COX8. TheCYC1 gene was induced fully within 15 min after the shift, was induced to a level that was about 50% higher than its aerobic level after 30"
https://openalex.org/W2038939970,"Abstract During the intraerythrocytic stage of infection, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum digests most of the host cell hemoglobin. Hemoglobin degradation occurs in the acidic digestive vacuole and is essential for the survival of the parasite. Two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, have been isolated from the vacuole and shown to make the initial cleavages in the hemoglobin molecule. We have studied the biosynthesis of these two enzymes. Plasmepsin I is synthesized and processed to the mature form soon after the parasite invades the red blood cell, while plasmepsin II synthesis is delayed until later in development. Otherwise, biosynthesis of the plasmepsins is identical. The proplasmepsins are type II integral membrane proteins that are transported through the secretory pathway before cleavage to the soluble form. They are not glycosylated in vivo, despite the presence of several potential glycosylation sites. Proplasmepsin maturation appears to require acidic conditions and is reversibly inhibited by the tripeptide aldehydesN-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-norleucinal andN-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-methional. These compounds are known to inhibit cysteine proteases and the chymotryptic activity of proteasomes but not aspartic proteases. However, proplasmepsin processing is not blocked by other cysteine protease inhibitors, nor by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Processing is also not blocked by aspartic protease inhibitors. This inhibitor profile suggests that unlike most other aspartic proteases, proplasmepsin maturation may not be autocatalytic in vivo, but instead could require the action of an unusual processing enzyme. Compounds that block processing are expected to be potent antimalarials."

To help define the initial events in TGF-β signaling, we characterized the kinase activity of the type II TGF-β receptor. A recombinant cytoplasmic domain of the receptor was purified from Escherichia coli and baculovirus-infected insect cells. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting demonstrated that the type II receptor kinase can autophosphorylate on tyrosine. Following an in vitro kinase reaction, the autophosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain and phosphorylation of exogenous substrate was shown by phosphoamino acid analysis to occur not only on serine and threonine but also on tyrosine. The dual kinase specificity of the receptor was also demonstrated using immunoprecipitated receptors expressed in mammalian cells and in vivo32P labeling showed phosphorylation of the receptor on serine and tyrosine. In addition, the kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin. Tryptic mapping and amino acid sequencing of in vitro autophosphorylated type II receptor cytoplasmic domain allowed the localization of the sites of tyrosine phosphorylation to positions 259, 336, and 424. Replacement of all three tyrosines with phenylalanines strongly inhibited the kinase activity of the receptor, suggesting that tyrosine autophosphorylation may play an autoregulatory role for the kinase activity of this receptor.

The importance of protein phosphorylation in various signaling events that regulate cell proliferation has been well documented. Most mitogenic growth factors interact with transmembrane tyrosine kinases or receptors that associate with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which, as a result of ligand-induced autophosphorylation, trigger signaling cascades that involve multiple phosphorylation events (1Fantl W.

Until the recent cloning and characterization of the cell surface receptors for TGF-β, little was known about the mechanisms of signal transduction by this growth factor or related factors. Cross-linking studies had previously shown the presence of several cell surface TGF-β binding proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 11Derynck R. Trends Biochem.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1565-1569Google Scholar). In addition to the TGF-β type II receptor, several other type II receptors for TGF-β related ligands have been characterized, including two types of type II activin receptors (18Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Google Scholar, 23Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Kintner C.R. Science. 1992; 255: 1702-1703Google Scholar, 24Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cheifetz S. Massagué J.

They are generally smaller than the type II receptors, have a defined cysteine pattern in their extracellular domains, and contain a highly conserved SGSGSGLP sequence immediately upstream of the cytoplasmic kinase domain. In contrast to the type II receptors, which define their own specificity of ligand binding, many type I receptors have their specificity of ligand binding largely determined by the coexpressed type II receptor. For example, the type I receptors Tsk7L (39Ebner R. Chen R.-H. Lawler S. Zionchek T. Derynck R. Science. 1993; 262: 900-902Google Scholar) and TSR1 (31Attisano L. Carcámo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M.B. Massagué J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar) bind TGF-β or activin depending on the coexpressed type II receptor. On the other hand, the ALK-5/R4 receptor is primarily a functional type I receptor for TGF-β (32Franzén P. ten Dijke P. Ichijo H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. Cell. 1993; 75: 681-692Google Scholar, 34ten Dijke P. Yamashita H. Ichijo H. Franzén P. Laiho M. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Science. 1994; 264: 101-104Google Scholar). The type I and type II receptors cooperate in signal transduction, and both receptor types are required for full responsiveness to TGF-β (20Bassing C.H. Yingling J.M. Howe D.J. Wang T. He W.W. Gustafson M.L. Shah P. Donahoe P.K. Wang X.-F. Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Google Scholar, 40Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentalla A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.-F. Massagué J.

Type II and type I receptors physically interact with each other, and such heteromeric complex formation is required for efficient ligand binding to type I receptors (20Bassing C.H. Yingling J.M. Howe D.J. Wang T. He W.W. Gustafson M.L. Shah P. Donahoe P.K. Wang X.-F. Science. 1994; 263: 87-89Google Scholar, 21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J.

The type II and type I receptors also exist as homomeric receptor complexes at the cell surface (45Henis Y.I. Moustakas A. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 139-154Google Scholar, 46Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Google Scholar). These findings led to the proposal that the two receptor types form a heteromeric, probably tetrameric, type II/type I receptor complex (12ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Google Scholar, 47Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Franzén P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20172-20178Google Scholar, 48Weis-Garcia F.M.B. Massagué J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Google Scholar), which mediates TGF-β signaling. In this complex, the cytoplasmic domains of the type II receptor are constitutively phosphorylated on serine and threonine, due to ligand-independent autophosphorylation and to phosphorylation by other cytoplasmic kinases (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar, 22Chen F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1565-1569Google Scholar). Furthermore, the type II receptor kinase phosphorylates the cytoplasmic domain of the type I receptor on serine and threonine (21Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Google Scholar, 22Chen F. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1565-1569Google Scholar) and the phosphorylation of both types of cytoplasmic domain contributes to the stability of the heteromeric complex (44Chen R.-H. Moses H.L. Maruoka E.M. Derynck R. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12235-12241Google Scholar). The existence of multiple type II receptors with defined ligand binding specificity and various type I receptors with an ability to bind different ligands, depending on the nature of the co-expressed type II receptor, suggests the existence of a complex signaling system in which combinatorial interactions may provide a substantial degree of flexibility in the cellular responses to TGF-β and related factors. To gain insight into the initial events in the signaling of TGF-β and related factors, we have further characterized the kinase activity of the type II TGF-β receptor. Using the cloned type II TGF-β and activin receptors, it has previously been shown that their kinase domains are able to autophosphorylate on serine and threonine (18Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Google Scholar, 19Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Google Scholar, 20Bassing C.H. Yingling J.M. Howe D.J. Wang T. He W.W.

However, a detailed comparison of kinase domain sequences of these and related receptors indicates some structural similarities with tyrosine kinases (50Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Google Scholar). 2S. Lawler, X.-H. Feng, R.-H. Chen, E. M. Maruoka, C. W. Turck, I. Griswold-Prenner, and R. Derynck, unpublished observations. 2S. Lawler, X.-H. Feng, R.-H. Chen, E. M. Maruoka, C. W. Turck, I. Griswold-Prenner, and R. Derynck, unpublished observations. In addition, endogenous activin type II receptor purified from mammalian cells exhibited not only serine and threonine but also tyrosine kinase activity (51Nakamura T. Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Sawai M. Takio K. Eto Y. Iwashita S. Muramatsu M. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18924-18928Google Scholar). In contrast, the recombinant type II receptors for activin and TGF-β have been reported to only have serine and threonine kinase activity (18Mathews L.S. Vale W.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 973-982Google Scholar, 19Lin H.Y. Wang X.-F. Ng-Eaton E. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.M. Cell. 1992; 68: 775-785Google Scholar, 20Bassing C.H. Yingling J.M. Howe D.J. Wang T. He W.W.

Because of this apparent contradiction, we have studied the autophosphorylation activity of the type II TGF-β receptors. We show that the cytoplasmic domain of this receptor phosphorylates itself and exogenous substrates not only on serine and threonine but also on tyrosine residues. We have also localized the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the type II receptor. Replacement of these tyrosines by phenylalanines strongly inhibits the kinase activity of the type II receptor. Our results establish the type II TGF-β receptor as a dual specificity kinase, which is autophosphorylated not only on serine and threonine but also on tyrosine, and suggest a dual specificity activity for other members of this receptor kinase family. Plasmid pGST-IIK was designed to express in Escherichia coli the C-terminal 374 amino acids of the type II TGF-β receptor cytoplasmic domain as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The corresponding coding region of the human type II TGF-β receptor cDNA was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), incorporating flanking EcoRI restriction sites. The PCR primers used were 5′-GGGGCCGAATTCCGGCAGCAGAAGCTGAGTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGGCCGAATTCGAGCTATTTGGTAGTGTTTAGG-3′. The EcoRI fragment was then ligated into the EcoRI site of pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), thus generating pGST-IIK and the sequence of this insert was verified using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Expression plasmid pVL1393-(His)6IIK was constructed to express the cytoplasmic kinase domain of the type II receptor in the baculovirus expression system. The same receptor cDNA fragment as in pGST-IIK was ligated into the EcoRI site of the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393(His)6 to allow expression of the cytoplasmic domain with an N-terminal (His)6 extension. pVL1393(His)6 was constructed by inserting oligonucleotide linkers encoding the sequence Met-Ser-(His)6 into the BamHI andEcoRI cut plasmid pVL1393 (Invitrogen). The linkers used were 5′-GATCCTATAAATATGTCGCATCATCATCATCATCATGGTTCCATGG-3′ and 5′-AATTCCATGGAACCATGATGATGATGATGATGCGACATATTTATAG-3′. Plasmid pIIR-myc (46Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Google Scholar) expresses the full-length human type II TGF-β receptor with a C-terminal Myc epitope tag when transfected into mammalian cells. In vitro mutagenesis of the cytoplasmic domain was done using the Sculptor kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The PCR product used in the construction of pGST-IIK was subcloned into M13mp18 to mutagenize the sequence encoding the cytoplasmic domain of the type II receptor. The mutated inserts were then ligated back into pGEX2T to generate the GST-fusion proteins inE. coli. The GST-IIK fusion protein was prepared as described (52Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of an overnight culture of E. coliDH5α cells transformed with pGST-IIK was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The culture was grown to anA600 nm of 1.0, and expression of the fusion protein was induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After an additional 5 h, the culture was harvested by centrifugation and the cells, resuspended in 30 ml of NETN (100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, were lysed by one freeze-thaw cycle followed by sonication for 2 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and 200 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated in suspension for 1 h. Following adsorption, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 30 ml of NETN, and resuspended at a concentration of 50% in NETN. To express the (His)6-tagged cytoplasmic domain in insect cells, pVL1393-(His)6IIK was cotransfected with PharMingen Baculogold linearized baculovirus DNA into SF9 insect cells. Plaque purification and recombinant virus screening were carried out as described (53O'Reilly D.R,. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. 1992; 67Google Scholar). For the production of fusion protein, cells were harvested 48–52 h after infection, pelleted, and lysed by resuspension in insect cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). After 20 min on ice, the suspension was cleared for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. The expressed fusion protein was purified by absorption through its (His)6-sequence using Co2+-chelate affinity chromatography. Briefly, the cleared cell lysate was incubated with Co2+-Sepharose 6B beads in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed in the same buffer containing 15 mm imidazole. The adsorbed protein was then eluted in buffer containing 100 mm imidazole and stored at −20 °C. GST-IIK bound to glutathione-Sepharose was resuspended and boiled in 2 × sample buffer (0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA), separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was then blocked at 4 °C overnight using TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% gelatin (Bio-Rad). The nitrocellulose was washed with TBST, and the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody PY20 (Zymed) was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in TBST and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was washed three times in TBST before addition of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Promega) at 0.2 μg/ml in TBST. After 1 h at room temperature, the blot was washed again and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Plasmid pIIR-myc, which drives the expression of a Myc-tagged human type II receptor (46Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Google Scholar), was transiently transfected (54Gorman C. Padmanabhan R. Howard B.H. Science. 1983; 221: 551-553Google Scholar) into 293 cells using 25 μg of DNA/10-cm diameter plate. Cells were metabolically labeled using [35S]Cys and [35S]Met, and the 35S-labeled type II receptor was immunoprecipitated as described (46Chen R.-H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22868-22874Google Scholar). The anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 was obtained from Dr. J. M. Bishop (University of California, San Francisco). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations were carried out using the PY20 (Zymed) and 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Ten μl (0.1–0.5 μg) of GST-IIK fusion protein, bound to glutathione-Sepharose and washed in 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2), was used for each reaction. Kinase reactions were carried out for 15 min in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer. When appropriate, histone 2B (Boehringer Mannheim) was added as substrate at a final concentration of 100 ng/μl. The kinase reactions using purified (His)6-IIK protein were carried out similarly. Kinase assays were also carried out on full-length receptors expressed in mammalian cells. 293 cells were transfected with pIIR-myc and lysed, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated 72 h after transfection. The immune complexes absorbed to protein A-Sepharose were then washed with GST kinase buffer (33% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NaVO4). The kinase reactions were initiated by addition of ATP to 10 μm and 1 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN; 3000 Ci/mmol) and allowed to proceed for 5 min at room temperature. Kinase inhibitors (Life Technologies, Inc.) were incorporated when appropriate and used according to the manufacturer's guidelines and as described previously (55Shum L. Reeves S.A. Kuo A.C. Fromer E.S. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 903-916Google Scholar). The kinase reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min prior to electrophoretic separation by SDS-PAGE. The gel was then fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. Kinase reactions were done as described above and the 32P-phosphorylated products were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) after separation by SDS-PAGE. The reaction products visualized by autoradiography were cut from the membrane and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis at 100 °C as described (56Kamps M.A Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 176: 22Google Scholar). 100 μg of affinity-purified (His)6-IIK fusion protein was phosphorylated in vitro as described above in a total volume of 100 μl in the presence of unlabeled ATP at a concentration of 1 mm. In parallel, 1–5 μg of (His)6-IIK fusion protein was autophosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. After completion of the assay, 400 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 20 mm EDTA containing 1 μg of modified trypsin, which does not undergo autoproteolysis (Promega), was added to the mixture which contained approximately 200,000 cpm of the 32P-labeled reaction product. Digestion was carried out for 2 h at 37 °C as described (57van der Geer P. Lao K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie G.D. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar), and the reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and treated with trypsin. To resolve the tryptic peptides by HPLC, the protein digest was loaded onto a reverse phase C18 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm, Vydac, Hesperia CA) and peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water over 1 h. The elution profile of the32P-labeled peptides was determined by Cerenkov counting of individual fractions. 100 μl of each fraction was dried down and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis. Peptide peaks that contained phosphotyrosine were sequenced by Edman degradation on a protein sequencer (model 492; Appied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA) to establish their sequence and the location of the phosphorylated tyrosines. These peaks were usually a mixture, but allowed us to establish the sequences of individual peptides. The amount of radioactivity corresponding to each cycle of Edman degradation and comparison with predicted sequences of the tryptic peptides allowed us to assign the phosphorylation to particular amino acids. Finally, the peptides corresponding to the established tyrosine-phosphorylated sequence were synthesized, and their elution positions on the C18 column confirmed the sequence identity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated tryptic peptides. 293 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid pIIR-myc as described above, and the transfected cells were labeled with 1 mCi/ml of [32P]phosphate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 3 g/liter glucose without phosphate, for 12 h. The cells were then lysed, and the type II receptors were immunoprecipitated using the anti-Myc antibody as described above for35S-labeled receptors. Following SDS-PAGE, the32P-labeled receptors were tr"

Science. 1996; 273: 1058-1073Google Scholar). polymerase recombinant RPB9 dithiothreitol phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride glutathione S-transferase 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid heart myosin kinase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the genes encoding the twelve subunits of pol II have been cloned and sequenced. Five of the ten small subunits of yeast pol II (RPB5, RPB6, RPB8, RPB10, and RPB12) are common to all three nuclear RNA polymerases (4Woychik N.A. Liao S.-M. Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 313-323Google Scholar, 5Treich I. Carles C. Riva M. Sentenac A. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 31-37Google Scholar). Several remaining pol II subunits have homologues in pol I and pol III. RPB11 (6Woychik N. Young R.A. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 77-82Google Scholar) is related to AC19, a subunit shared by pols I and III (7Dequard-Chablat M. Riva M. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15300-15307Google Scholar). RPB7 is similar to the pol III subunit C25 (8Sadhale P.P. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6164-6170Google Scholar). RPB9 is related to the pol I subunit, A12.2 (9Nogi Y. Yano R. Dodd J. Carles C. Nomura M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 114-122Google Scholar). At least six pol II small subunits from S. cerevisiae are functionally interchangeable with human subunits (RPB6, RPB7, RPB8, RPB9, RPB10, and RPB12) (10Khazak V. Sadhale P. Woychik N. Brent R. Golemis E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 759-775Google Scholar, 11McKune K. Moore P.A. Hull M.W. Woychik N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6895-6900Google Scholar, 12Shpakovski G. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Google Scholar). Genetic analysis indicates that only two yeast pol II subunits, RPB4 and RPB9, are not essential for cell viability (13Woychik N.A. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2854-2859Google Scholar, 14Woychik R.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar). In yeast, deletion of RPB9 results in mild temperature sensitivity and relatively normal levels of transcription in vivo. However, for most genes examined, the selectivity of the site of transcription initiation is altered, with new start sites shifted upstream relative to wild-type sites (15Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Google Scholar, 16Furter-Graves E.M. Furter R. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4121-4127Google Scholar, 17Furter-Graves E. Hall B. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Google Scholar). The transcription initiation phenotype can be recapitulated in vitro, and addition of recombinant purified RPB9 (rRPB9) restores wild-type start site selection (15Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Google Scholar). RPB9 from S. cerevisiae is a 122-amino acid polypeptide that contains two zinc binding domains (14Woychik R.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal zinc binding domain shares 25% sequence identity with that of the general transcript elongation factor TFIIS (18Kaine B.P. Mehr I.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3854-3856Google Scholar) and is predicted to adopt a zinc ribbon fold (17Furter-Graves E. Hall B. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Google Scholar, 18Kaine B.P. Mehr I.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3854-3856Google Scholar, 19Qian X. Jeon C. Yoon H. Agarwal K. Weiss M. Nature. 1993; 365: 277-279Google Scholar). This domain is required for the function of RPB9 in start site selection 2M. Hampsey, personal communication. and is required within TFIIS for elongation stimulation (20Agarwal K. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Yoon H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7842-7851Google Scholar). The homology of RPB9 to TFIIS suggested that RPB9 may play a role in transcript elongation. In addition, the altered start site selection of pol II lacking RPB9 (pol IIΔ9) suggested some alteration in positioning the catalytic center of the polymerase, and a mobile catalytic center is a prominent feature of several recent models for transcript elongation (21Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1995; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 22Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar, 23Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M.

Thus the elongation properties of highly purified pol II and pol IIΔ9 were compared. The availability of purified rRPB9 and TFIIS was exploited to characterize the functional interactions among pol II and these factors during the transcription elongation process. RNA polymerase II lacking RPB9 (pol IIΔ9) was purified from the S. cerevisiae strain WY9 (14Woychik R.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar). pol II and pol IIΔ9 were purified as described previously (25Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Google Scholar), except that 10 μmZnCl2 was included in all buffers. The polymerase preparations were stored at −80 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mm ammonium sulfate, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm DTT, 100 μm EDTA, and 10 μmZnCl2. The RPB9 coding region (14Woychik R.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar) was subcloned using polymerase chain reaction amplification to generate the coding region with an NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end of the sequence and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The amplified insert was then cloned between theNdeI and the BamHI sites of the pET15b bacterial expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) to generate a fusion protein between RPB9 and an NH2-terminal hexahistidine tag. BL21(DE3) cells containing the pET15bRPB9 plasmid were grown toA600 of 0.8 at 37 °C. The RPB9 protein expression was induced at 30 °C by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 3 h postinduction by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine (2 ml/g of cells), frozen, thawed, and then lysed by sonication at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 55,000 × g for 30 min in a Beckman SW28 rotor, and then NaCl was added to a final concentration of 500 mm. The supernatant was passed through a DE52 column (2.5 × 5 cm; Whatman, Maidstone, UK) and loaded directly onto His-bind resin (2.5 × 2.5 cm; Novagen, Madison, WI), previously charged with 200 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated in purification buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mmPMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine) containing 5 mmimidazole. The His-bind column was washed with 5 column volumes of purification buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. RPB9 was eluted from the column with purification buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 300 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. The eluate was dialyzed for 8 h against purification buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm DTT but lacking PMSF and benzamidine. The dialysate was treated with bovine thrombin (3 μg of thrombin/mg of RPB9 fusion) for 4 h at room temperature, diluted 2-fold with purification buffer containing 10 mm DTT, passed through a Poros S column (0.75 × 10 cm; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA), and loaded onto a 2-ml hydroxyapatite fast protein liquid chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The column was developed with a 5 mm to 150 mm gradient of sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mmbenzamidine, and RPB9 eluted at 50 mm phosphate. The purified protein was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mm DTT and stored frozen at −70 °C. To generate a fusion protein of GST and RPB9, the RPB9 coding region (14Woychik R.A. Lane W.S. Young R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19053-19055Google Scholar) was subcloned using polymerase chain reaction amplification to generate the coding region with a BamHI restriction site at both the 5′ and 3′ ends. The amplified insert was then cloned into the BamHI site of the pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The GST-RPB9 fusion protein was expressed as described above for recombinant RPB9 using HB101 cells. The cells were harvested and lysed as described previously, with the exception that the NaCl concentration was maintained at 100 mm. The supernatant was passed through a DE52 column (2.5 × 2 cm; Whatman) and loaded directly onto a glutathione-Sepharose-4B column (2.5 × 3 cm; Pharmacia) previously equilibrated with Buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1.8 mm potassium phosphate, 2.7 mmKCl, 140 mm NaCl 10 mm DTT, 1 mmPMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine). The glutathione column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer A followed by 5 column volumes of Tris buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine). The GST-RPB9 fusion protein was eluted from the column with Tris buffer containing 10 mm glutathione. The purified protein was dialyzed against 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 10 mmDTT and stored frozen at −70 °C. Yeast TFIIS was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein containing an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag in bacterial cells (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar), and the expressed protein was purified as described below. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Bacterial cells (2L) expressing the yeast TFIIS protein were lysed using a French pressure cell in Buffer A (20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 55,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman SW28 rotor, and the supernatant was loaded onto a DE52 column (2.5 × 2.5 cm; Whatman). The flow through was loaded onto an SP Fast Flow column (1 × 8 cm; Pharmacia), washed with Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. The eluate was loaded directly onto a Poros MC column (0.75 × 10 cm; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA) equilibrated with NiSO4. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm imidazole. Yeast TFIIS was eluted with Buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl and 500 mm imidazole, immediately dialyzed against Buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm DTT, and stored frozen at −70 °C. These procedures were carried out as described previously (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar). Briefly, transcription by purified pol II was initiated from a 3′ deoxycytidine tailed template containing a human histone H3.3 gene fragment, which contains well characterized blocks to elongation (27Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar). The RNA transcript was pulse-labeled at the 5′ end by incubating in the presence of 20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), 0.8 mm GTP, ATP, and UTP for 75 s, followed by elongation to the blocks to elongation in the presence of 0.1 mmunlabeled CTP for 75 s. Ternary complexes stalled at these sites were treated in two different ways. For the read-through assay, yeast TFIIS was added, transcription was allowed to proceed for the designated intervals, and the resulting transcripts were collected by ethanol precipitation and resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), 8.3 m urea, Tris borate-EDTA gel. The transcripts were quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For the cleavage reaction, the stalled ternary complexes were purified from unincorporated nucleotides by two sequential Bio-gel 30 spin columns (Bio-Rad). TFIIS was then added to the purified complexes, and incubation was continued at 30 °C. At designated time points, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of stopping buffer. The transcripts were resolved and quantified as described above. For analysis of intrinsic cleavage, the standard cleavage assay described above was modified by including a third Bio-gel 30 spin column equilibrated with 70 mm CAPS, K+, pH 9.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots were removed to an equal volume of stop buffer and resolved as described above. An oligonucleotide encoding the heart myosin kinase (HMK) consensus phosphorylation sequence (RRASVDF) was inserted into theNdeI site of the plasmid pET15bPPR2 (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar), between the sequences encoding the thrombin cleavage site and TFIIS. The resulting TFIIS fusion protein was expressed and purified as described for the purification of yeast TFIIS. This protein was phosphorylated at the HMK consensus site using HMK (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's instructions. The labeled protein was dialyzed against Buffer A containing 10 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl to remove the free radiolabel. The32P-labeled TFIIS and unphosphorylated TFIIS were equally active in assays of read-through and transcript cleavage. For the binding assay, 0.85 pmol of 32P-HMK-TFIIS were incubated in a 5-μl volume for a minimum of 20 min with 0.1–4.5 pmol of pol II in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT and a final salt concentration between 40 and 50 mm KOAc. The binary TFIIS-polymerase complex was resolved from free yeast TFIIS by electrophoresis for 2–3 h at 100 V at 4 °C on a 5% polyacrylamide (30:0.8 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) gel containing 50 mm Tris, 50 mm borate, 10 μm ZnSO4, and 1% glycerol. The amount of bound 32P-HMK-TFIIS was quantified by phosphorimaging. pol IIΔ9 was isolated using a combination of heparin, immunoaffinity, and anion exchange chromatography. This method yielded a purified enzyme devoid of RPB9 but containing all of the remaining subunits (Fig.1). The yield of pol IIΔ9 enzyme was similar to that of pol II, approximately 0.8 mg/100 g of packed yeast. Purified pol IIΔ9 consistently demonstrated a 2–3-fold higher specific activity than pol II in assays of promoter-independent RNA chain elongation on denatured DNA templates. However, the maximal elongation rate was indistinguishable between the two polymerases. The enzymes were also similar in the rate and extent of pyrophosphorolysis and the temperature dependence of promoter-independent assays of RNA synthesis (data not shown). rRPB9 was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. The yield of rRPB9 was 5 mg/liter of bacterial culture. We judged rRPB9 to be functional on the basis of two observations. First, the zinc content of rRPB9 was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy to be 2.4 ± 0.4 mol of zinc/mol of rRPB9, in keeping with the predicted stoichiometry of zinc binding by RPB9. 3I. Donaldson, personal communication. Second, this RPB9 preparation restores accurate transcription start site utilization in nuclear extracts prepared from yeast cells lacking RPB9. 4M. W. Hull and N. A. Woychik, personal communication. Although rRPB9 was transcriptionally active, it readily formed aggregates. Dynamic light scattering studies of rRPB9 at 3 mg/ml revealed a polydisperse preparation whose average size corresponded to a pentamer. In an attempt to reduce the propensity to aggregate, another recombinant version of RPB9 was prepared, in the form of a fusion to GST. The purified GST-RPB9 was dimeric (in keeping with the dimeric nature of native GST), monodisperse in solution, and also active in assays of promoter-dependent transcription. However, if the GST moiety was removed from the purified GST-RPB9, the RPB9 that was generated once again aggregated. We could not prepare a version of RPB9 that was unaggregated. Therefore we used RPB9 fusion proteins for reconstitution experiments. In each such experiment, the source of the RPB9 is indicated, and the corresponding state of aggregation was therefore known. The observation that pol II and pol IIΔ9 have the same maximal elongation rate yet pol IIΔ9 synthesizes more RNA in chain elongation assays suggested that pol IIΔ9 pauses less frequently during elongation. To test this idea, we examined the behavior of pol IIΔ9 at well characterized blocks to elongation. Purified pol II stops in vitro at several sites within the human histone H3.3 first intron (27Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 299-312Google Scholar). The strongest block, TIa, has been used extensively to study the elongation properties of pol II from yeast and mammalian cells (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 28Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar, 29Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q. Mote Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15516-15522Google Scholar, 30SivaRaman L. Reines D. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14554-14560Google Scholar, 31Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Google Scholar, 32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Google Scholar, 33Ciprés-Palacı́n G. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15375-15380Google Scholar). We observed that pol IIΔ9 transcribes through TIa with higher efficiency than pol II; 50–65% of pol IIΔ9 elongates past TIa compared with 15–30% for pol II. The differences in elongation efficiency are moderate but reproducible; these values reflect the range of TIa read-through in more than a dozen independent experiments with at least two different preparations of each enzyme. To exclude the possibility that the purification of pol IIΔ9 for some reason results in a more efficiently elongating enzyme and that the elongation differences were indeed a property of RPB9, we tested whether purified RPB9 could restore the wild-type elongation properties of pol IIΔ9. The addition of increasing amounts of rRPB9 or GST-RPB9 to pol IIΔ9 resulted in decreased (wild-type) levels of read-through at the TIa intrinsic block to elongation (Fig.2 A). The decrease in transcription likely results from the reconstitution of wild-type polymerase activity by RPB9 and pol IIΔ9 because addition of greater than 200-fold molar excess of rRPB9 to either pol IIΔ9 or pol II did not decrease read-through below that observed with pol II alone. Wild-type elongation levels were restored to pol IIΔ9 by a 3–5-fold molar excess of GST-RPB9 and a 10-fold molar excess of rRPB9. The addition of purified RPB9 to pol IIΔ9 not only decreased read-through activity but also decreased the total level of transcription from the dC-tailed templates (Fig. 2 B). We observed that pol IIΔ9 synthesized 3–15 times more transcripts from the dC-tailed template than did either pol IIΔ9 + RPB9 or the wild-type enzyme, even though pol IIΔ9 was only 1.5–2-fold more active than the wild-type enzyme in the normal assays for promoter-independent chain elongation. RPB9 must inhibit transcription from these templates at an early stage in the reaction because the transcripts are pulse-labeled during the formation of the first 20 or so nucleotides. Using native gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have shown that the two enzymes bind the tailed template with equal affinity (data not shown). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of RPB9 takes place after binding of the polymerase and before the synthesis of the first 20 nucleotides. The mechanism of inhibition remains to be established. The addition of rRPB9 to pol IIΔ9 causes more polymerase to arrest at TIa. The effect of this subunit apparently contrasts with that of the elongation factor TFIIS, which stimulates transcription through TIa, as well as several other elongation blocks. To explore the functional interactions between RPB9 and TFIIS, we compared read-through stimulation by TFIIS with both pol II and pol IIΔ9-containing arrested complexes. For the wild-type enzyme, a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS maximally stimulates read-through of TIa by 30 min, at which time nearly two-thirds of the initially arrested complexes are reactivated (Fig.3 A). By contrast, arrested pol IIΔ9 ternary complexes were completely unresponsive to this level of TFIIS during a 30-min incubation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 6–10; also Fig. 3 D for quantification). The apparent decrease in the levels of the TIa transcript in Fig. 3 B (lane 5) reflects a decreased level of radioactivity in the entire lane and not a TFIIS-independent read-through event. Once again, to ensure that the inability of pol IIΔ9 to respond to these levels of TFIIS was caused by the lack of RPB9, we attempted to restore wild-type TFIIS responsiveness by the addition of purified RPB9. A 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS was added to pol IIΔ9 ternary complexes formed in the presence of rRPB9. The reconstituted polymerase (pol IIΔ9 + RPB9) responded to TFIIS with the same kinetics of read-through as did pol II (Fig. 3 C, lanes 6–10). It was not necessary to preincubate the RPB9 with pol IIΔ9 to observe reconstitution of activity; identical results were obtained if RPB9 was added with TFIIS. We tested if the pol IIΔ9 arrested complexes were completely refractory to TFIIS treatment or whether a large molar excess of TFIIS was able to promote read-through by pol IIΔ9-containing ternary complexes. pol IIΔ9 arrested complexes were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of TFIIS, and at these levels the arrested complexes could be marginally stimulated to read-through the TIa arrest site, as determined by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 3 B, lanes 11–15). TFIIS-stimulated read-through requires a nascent transcript cleavage event (34Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 35Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Google Scholar, 36Guo H. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18762-18770Google Scholar). Because pol IIΔ9 appears to be deficient in responding to TFIIS, we tested whether pol IIΔ9 displayed aberrant cleavage activity by comparing cleavage by pol II and pol IIΔ9 complexes in response to TFIIS. As had been observed previously (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar), the addition of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS to arrested wild-type elongation complexes rapidly generated shortened transcripts (C1 and C2) that were stably associated with active ternary complexes as shown by their ability to elongate upon the addition of nucleotides (Fig. 4 A). The cleaved transcripts appear to be generated sequentially. The first cleaved product (C1) appeared within 1 min (Fig. 4 A, lane 3), and over the course of 30 min a smaller product (C2) appeared, followed then by a range of shorter RNA species. Such a pattern of digestion has been observed previously for both yeast and mammalian enzymes (26Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 34Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar). The pattern and kinetics of TFIIS-stimulated transcript cleavage by pol IIΔ9 differ significantly from that of pol II. Like pol II, pol IIΔ9 complexes also cleave the nascent RNA chain to C1 in the presence of a 3-fold molar excess of TFIIS. The pol IIΔ9-generated C1 cleavage products appear more slowly than do the pol II-generated C1 cleavage products (compare Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–6, and Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–7). In contrast to the pol II complexes, pol IIΔ9 complexes did not generate the second and subsequent cleavage products, even after 30 min or longer in the presence of TFIIS. To ensure that the differences in the cleavage reaction were due to the presence or the absence of RPB9, we tested if purified RPB9 would restore the wild-type cleavage pattern and kinetics. A 10-fold molar excess of rRPB9 was added to pol IIΔ9 complexes either prior or subsequent to arrest complex formation. The resulting enzyme (pol IIΔ9 + RPB9) displayed an identical response to TFIIS compared with pol II (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–5). The requirement for RPB9 in read-through could be diminished by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of TFIIS (Fig. 3). Similarly, the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of TFIIS to arrested pol IIΔ9 complexes returned the cleavage patterns and kinetics to that seen in complexes formed with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4 D). Therefore, in the absence of RPB9, the polymerase requires substantially higher TFIIS levels to effect cleavage and read-through. The observed results would be explained if pol IIΔ9 was defective in catalyzing transcript cleavage. Thus the intrinsic cleavage activities of pol II and pol IIΔ9 were compared. We found that pol IIΔ9 did not appear to have any intrinsic defect in catalyzing transcript cleavage. Moderate elevation in pH can stimulate intrinsic cleavage by pol II, 5Weilbaecher, R. G., Awrey, D. E., Edwards, A. M., and Kane, C. M., in preparation. similar to the intrinsic cleavage reaction observed with E. coli RNA polymerase (37Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Google Scholar). At basic pH, yeast pol II complexes halted at TIa cleave their transcripts in the absence of TFIIS. Although such intrinsic cleavage can occur at physiologic pH under some solution conditions, the conditions used to assay TFIIS-stimulated cleavage demonstrated no intrinsic cleavage over the course of 30 min (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 1 and 2). In comparing intrinsic cleavage by pol II and pol IIΔ9 under mildly alkaline conditions, we observed no difference in the size of the cleavage products nor in the rate of transcript cleavage (Fig. 5). The intrinsic cleavage products correspond approximately to the mobilities of the TFIIS-stimulated cleavage products; however, direct determination of the cleavage increment has not been established. Extension of the intrinsic shortened transcripts at pH 9.5 can result in synthesis back to the original TIa site. Some intrinsic shortened transcripts are elongated slightly past the TIa site (see Fig. 5, Nuc lane); the mechanism of this elongation event remains to be established, and further characterization of the intrinsic cleavage activity of pol II will be presented elsewhere.5 In summary, the similarity of pol II and pol IIΔ9 in the intrinsic cleavage reaction suggests that pol IIΔ9 is deficient in some other aspect of TFIIS-mediated read-through. A trivial explanation for our observations would be that the reduced response of pol IIΔ9 to TFIIS arises from a reduced affinity of pol IIΔ9 for TFIIS. Therefore, the affinity of pol II and pol IIΔ9 for TFIIS was examined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay that measures the association of radiolabeled TFIIS with polymerase in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (38Wu J."
https://openalex.org/W2021986727,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is associated with severe psoriasis, B cell lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. A deregulated production of interleukin-6 (IL6) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormal IL6 secretion of HIV-1-infected cells may include transactivation of the IL6 gene by HIV-1. Here we report the molecular mechanisms of Tat activity on the expression of the IL6 gene. By using 5′ deletion mutants of pIL6Pr-CAT and using IL6:HIV-1-LTR hybrid constructs where discrete regions of the IL6 promoter replaced the TAR sequence in HIV-1 LTR, we identified a short sequence of the 5′-untranslated region of the IL6 mRNA that is required for Tat to trans-activate the IL6 promoter. This sequence acquires a stem-loop structure and includes a UCU sequence that binds to Tat and is necessary for full trans-activation. In addition, we provide the evidence that Tat can function by enhancing the CAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) DNA binding activity and is able to complex with in vitro translated C/EBPβ, which is a major mediator of IL6 promoter function. By using the yeast two-hybrid system and immunoprecipitation, we observed that the interaction of Tat with C/EBP proteins also occurred in vivo. The data are consistent with the possibility that Tat may function on heterologous genes by interacting with RNA structures possibly present in a large number of cellular and viral genes. In addition, Tat may function by protein-protein interactions, leading to the generation of heterodimers with specific transcription factors.

Studies on small cohorts of subjects who were exposed to HIV-1 and did not develop HIV-1 infection and individuals who harbored HIV-1 but remained disease-free for long periods (4Nowak M.A. Anderson R.M. McLeann A.R. Wolfs T.F.W. Goudsmit J. May R.M. Science. 1991; 254: 963-969Google Scholar, 5Biggar R.J. AIDS. 1990; 4: 1059-1065Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the development of AIDS may depend on a dynamic interplay between viral and host cellular gene products. Accordingly, in HIV-1-infected subjects there is a deregulated production of cytokines, including the proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6) (6Nakajima N. Martinez-Maza O. Hirano T. Breen E.C. Nishanian P.G. Sazar-Gonzalez J.F. Fahey J.L. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 144-155Google Scholar), which affects the growth and differentiation of lymphoid and mesenchymal cells (7Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Google Scholar) and may contribute to the development of the clinical features of AIDS. Accordingly, IL6 gene transcription is induced in cells infected by HIV-1 (8Breen E.C. Rezal A.R. Nakajima K. Beall G.N. Mitsuyasu R.T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Martinez-Maza O. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 480-487Google Scholar), and increased levels of IL6 have been reported in serum and cerebral spinal fluid of HIV-1-infected patients (9Gallo P., K. Frei K. Rordorf C. Lazdins J. Tavolato B. Fontana A. J. Neuroimmunol. 1989; 23: 109-115Google Scholar).The Tat protein of HIV-1 is required for efficient viral gene expression (10Rosen C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A.

Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 9: 273-282Google Scholar). Tat increases the initiation of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR (14Rice A.P. Matthews M.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 551-555Google Scholar) and affects RNA processing and utilization by interacting with a transactivating responsive element (TAR) located between nucleotides +1 and + 44 with respect to the initiation site (+1) of viral transcription (16Lapsia M.F. Rice A.P. Matthews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Google Scholar, 17Arya S.K. Guo C. Josephs S.F. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Google Scholar). TAR contains a 6-nucleotide loop and a 3-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge that are essential for Tat activity (18Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 229: 74-77Google Scholar, 19Garcia J.A. Harrich D. Soultanakis E.W.F. Mitsuyasu R. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 765-778Google Scholar, 20Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

A. 1989; 86: 6925-6929Google Scholar). Tat binds to the bulge and appears to require cellular factors binding to the loop sequence to efficiently transactivate the HIV-1 LTR (22Roy S. Delling U. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Sonenberg N. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1365-1373Google Scholar, 23Nelbock P. Dillon P.J. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1990; 248: 1650-1653Google Scholar, 24Desai K. Loewestein P.M. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8875-8879Google Scholar). In addition, Tat interacts with upstream regulatory DNA sequences circumscribed within the NF-κB/Sp1 sites of the HIV-1 promoter (25Berkhout B. Gatignol A. Rabson A.B. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 757-767Google Scholar) and with host cell proteins (12Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Google Scholar, 24Desai K. Loewestein P.M. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8875-8879Google Scholar). The 86-amino acid-long Tat contains a highly conserved cysteine-rich region, which mediates the formation of metal-linked dimers in vitro and is essential for Tat function (16Lapsia M.F. Rice A.P. Matthews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Google Scholar, 17Arya S.K. Guo C. Josephs S.F. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Google Scholar, 18Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 229: 74-77Google Scholar). A conserved basic region with 6 arginines and 2 lysines in nine residues, stretching from amino acid 47 to 58, is crucial for nuclear localization, mediates the specific binding of Tat to TAR RNA, and is required for the full activity of Tat (26Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Goebl M. Taniguchi T. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1992; 357: 700-704Google Scholar, 27Dang C.V. Lee W.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18019-18023Google Scholar, 28Siomi H. Shida H.

Science. 1990; 249: 1281-1285Google Scholar).In addition to its role in HIV-1 transcription, Tat may participate in the development of AIDS by modulating the expression of heterologous genes. In support of this possibility, Tat has been shown to increase the expression of cellular genes, such as the IL6 (30Scala G. Ruocco M.R. Ambrosino C. Mallardo M. Giordano V. Baldassarre F. Dragonetti E. Quinto I. Venuta S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 961-971Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-β genes (31Sastry K.J. Reddy R.H.R. Pandita R. Totpal K. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20091-20093Google Scholar, 32Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Chang H.K. Bohan C.A. Kao V. Morgan R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Virol. 1992; 68: 2677-2682Google Scholar), and to activate the life cycle of some AIDS-associated viruses (33Chowdhury M. Taylor J.P. Chang C.F. Rappaport J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7355-7361Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the Tat-mediated activation of non-HIV-1 genes are obscure. Here, we describe the mechanisms for Tat-mediated induction of the IL6 gene expression. We find that Tat is tethered to the IL6 transcription start site by specific binding to a UCU sequence present in the stem-loop structure of IL6 leader RNA. Tat physically interacts with C/EBPβ and increases selectively the nuclear pool of C/EBP factors binding to the C/EBPcis sequence in the IL6 promoter. This interaction was confirmed to occur in vivo by immunoprecipitation and by using the yeast two-hybrid system.DISCUSSIONDespite the intensive investigation of the immunopathogenesis of AIDS, many questions concerning the molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 primary infection and progression remain unanswered (5Biggar R.J. AIDS. 1990; 4: 1059-1065Google Scholar, 51Pantaleo G. Graziosi C. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 327-335Google Scholar, 52Paul W.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 177-182Google Scholar). Recently, the identification of cohorts of HIV-exposed individuals who remain free of infection over a long period of viral exposure (53Salk J. Bretscher P.A. Salk P.M. Clerici M. Shearer G.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1270-1272Google Scholar) as well as the existence of a small subgroup of HIV-1-infected subjects who are long term nonprogressors were described (54Pantaleo G. Menzo S. Vaccerezze M. Graziosi C. Cohen O.J. Demorest J.F. Montefiori D. Orenstein J.M. Fox C. Schrager L.K. Fauci A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 209-216Google Scholar). Together with recent reports on viral life cycle (55Wey X. Ghosh S.K. Taylor M.E. Johnson V.A. Emini E.A. Deutsch P. Lifson J.D. Bonhoeffer S. Nowak M.A. Hahn B.H. Saag M.S. Shaw G.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 117-122Google Scholar, 56Ho D. Neumann A.U. Perelson A.S. Chen W. Leonard J.M. Markowitz M. Nature. 1995; 373: 123-126Google Scholar), the above evidence argues that HIV infection and disease progression may ultimately result from a complex interplay between viral and host cellular factors involved in the immunological response to the viral infection and in the clinical evolution of AIDS.HIV-1 Tat is a potent transactivator of HIV-1 LTR, acting on nascent TAR RNA and promoting full-length gene transcription (10Rosen C. Sodroski J.G. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 813-823Google Scholar, 11Sharp P.A. Marciniak R.A. Cell. 1989; 59: 229-230Google Scholar, 12Gatignol A. Buckler-White A. Berkhout B. Jeang K.-T. Science. 1991; 251: 1597-1600Google Scholar, 13Cullen B.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 417-420Google Scholar). Accordingly, Tat-defective HIV-1 is not viable (57Dayton A.I. Sodroski J.C. Rosen C.A. Goh W.C. Haseltine W.A. Cell. 1986; 44: 941-947Google Scholar, 58Fisher A.G. Feinberg M.B. Josephs S.F. Harper M.E. Marselle L.M. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1986; 320: 367-371Google Scholar). Emerging evidence shows that, in addition to its role on HIV-1 gene expression, Tat may exert additional functions. Tat is released in some extent extracellularly (20Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Google Scholar, 59Ensoli B. Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Fiorelli V. Gendelman R. Morgan R.A. Wingfield P. Gallo R.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 277-287Google Scholar) and can function as a cytokine. In fact, Tat promotes the growth of endothelial cells and Kaposi's sarcoma cells directly or synergistically with basic fibroblast growth factor (Ref.60Ensoli B. Gendelman R. Markham P. Fiorelli V. Colombini S. Raffeld M. Cafaro A. Chang H. Brady J.N. Gallo R.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 674-680Google Scholar and references therein) and enhances cell survival intat-expressing cells (61Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485Google Scholar). Constitutive expression oftat in transgenic mice results in tumor development, including Kaposi's-like sarcomas and B cell lymphomas (62Corallini A. Altavilla G. Pozzi L. Bignozzi F. Negrini M. Rimessi P. Gualandi F. Barbanti-Brodano G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5569-5575Google Scholar). Accordingly, stable expression of tat in IL6-dependent cells results in growth factor-independent growth and in tumorigenicity (30Scala G. Ruocco M.R. Ambrosino C. Mallardo M. Giordano V. Baldassarre F. Dragonetti E. Quinto I. Venuta S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 961-971Google Scholar). Moreover, data in support of a nontranscriptional function of Tat in virion infectivity has been reported (63Huang L. Joshi A. Willey R. Orenstein J. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Google Scholar). The above evidence strongly suggests that Tat may participate in the establishment of HIV-1 infection and in the development of AIDS clinical features by promoting the expression of host cellular genes. In support of this possibility, Tat has been shown to activate the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL6 and tumor necrosis factor-β (30Scala G. Ruocco M.R. Ambrosino C. Mallardo M.

Tat was also shown to suppress promoter activity of major histocompatibility complex class I genes (66Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin J.L. Wirth P.J. Science. 1992; 269: 1320-1322Google Scholar) and to exert immunosuppressive activity on antigen-induced T cell proliferation (67Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Google Scholar, 68Meyaard L. Otto S.A. Jonker R.R. Mijnster M.J. Keet R.P.M. Miedema F. Science. 1992; 257: 217-219Google Scholar, 69Chirmule N. Than S. Khan S.A. Pahwa S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 492-498Google Scholar). Moreover, Tat has been shown to promote apoptosis by up-regulating CD95 ligand expression (70Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debati K.M. Kramer H.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Google Scholar) or by activating cyclin-dependent kinases (71Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 429-431Google Scholar).The mechanisms of Tat function on the expression of heterologous genes are unknown. In this paper, we address in molecular detail the mechanisms of Tat activity on the expression of IL6, a cytokine with a broad biological activity (7Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Google Scholar, 72Scala G. Quinto I. Ruocco M.R. Arcucci A. Mallardo M. Caretto P. Forni G. Venuta S. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 61-68Google Scholar) whose expression is deregulated in HIV-infected subjects (6Nakajima N. Martinez-Maza O. Hirano T. Breen E.C. Nishanian P.G. Sazar-Gonzalez J.F. Fahey J.L. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 144-155Google Scholar, 8Breen E.C. Rezal A.R. Nakajima K. Beall G.N. Mitsuyasu R.T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Martinez-Maza O. J.

By using 5′ deletion mutants of pIL6-CAT plasmid, and IL6:HIV-1-LTR hybrid plasmids where discrete regions of the IL6 promoter replaced the TAR sequence in HIV-1 LTR, we identified a short sequence of the 5′-untranslated region of IL6 mRNA that is required for Tat to transactivate the IL6 promoter. This region can acquire a stem-loop structure including a UCU trinucleotide bulge. Point mutations of the UCU bulge or of the stem resulted in a drastic decrease in Tat responsiveness (shown in Fig. 3) and in the inability of Tat to bind to the IL6 leader RNAs (Fig. 4). The IL6 RNA structure, with an estimated structure energy of −9.1 kcal/mol, is expected to be less stable than the TAR RNA structure. This suggests that Tat could bind with a low affinity to heterologous RNA sequences and may account for the ability of Tat to regulate the expression of multiple genes. Interestingly, Tat was still able to induce a low but significant activation of the bulge mutant pIL6(−596/+15)M1-CAT plasmid (shown in Fig. 3), suggesting that Tat can function, albeit at a lower efficiency, without binding to an RNA tethering structure. In this case, Tat could be directed to the transcription start site of IL6 promoter by associating with specific transcription factors. This possibility is supported by the reports showing that Tat may associate with Sp1, TFIID factors, RNA polymerase II, and RNA polymerase II-associated factors (50Jeang K.T. Chun R. Lin N.H. Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Google Scholar, 73Howcroft T.K. Palmer L.A. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J.N. Singer D.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 605-610Google Scholar). In addition, we now provide evidence that Tat can function by cooperating with C/EBP transcription factors. In fact, we observed an increase in the C/EBP DNA binding activity of tat-expressing cells with a selective increase in the amounts of nuclear C/EBPβ factors (Figs. 5and 6). This raises the possibility that Tat may increase the nuclear levels of C/EBP transcription factors by inducing post-translational modifications of C/EBP factors through the activation of specific kinases. Indeed, Tat activity on HIV-1 LTR-driven gene expression requires protein kinase C (79Jakobovits A. Rosenthal A. Capon D.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1165-1170Google Scholar). Moreover, specific interaction of Tat with a cellular protein kinase has been reported (80Yang X. Herrmann C.H. Rice A.P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4576-4584Google Scholar), and serine and threonine phosphorylations of C/EBPβ are required for IL6 promoter activation (81Nakajima N. Kinoscita S. Sasagawa K. Sasaki K. Naruto T. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Google Scholar). The above data are consistent with and extend the recent observation that Tat enhances the tumor necrosis factor-induced activation of NF-κB binding activity by possibly inducing protein phosphorylation (82Westendorp M.O. Shatrov V.A. Shulze-Osthoff K. Frank R. Kraft M. Los M. Krammer H.P. Droge W. Lehmann V. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 546-554Google Scholar). Since C/EBP and NF-κB factors associate as heterodimers (83LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8145-8149Google Scholar), which are potent activators of HIV-1 LTR (84Ruocco M.R. Chen X. Ambrosino C. Dragonetti E. Liu W. Mallardo M. De Falco G. Palmieri C. Franzoso G. Quinto I. Venuta S. Scala G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22479-22486Google Scholar), the above data suggest that Tat may also promote HIV-1 gene expression by up-regulating the cellular levels of transcription factors acting on the viral LTR. Moreover, Tat was able to complex with in vitro translated C/EBPβ, which is a major mediator of IL6 promoter function (Fig. 7). By immunoprecipitation and by taking advantage of the yeast two-hybrid system, this interaction was proved to occur also in vivo and to result in transcriptional activation of a reporter lacZ gene (shown in Figs. 8 and 9). The Tat association with C/EBPβ suggests that Tat may increase the DNA binding activity of C/EBP dimers by enhancing their affinity for the target DNA. This mechanism accounts for the Tax activity on transcription mediated by bZip proteins (86Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Google Scholar, 87Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm K.M. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Google Scholar). In the EMSA experiments shown in Fig. 5A, Tat could not be detected in the C/EBP-DNA complexes with an anti-Tat antibody (data not shown). This suggests either that Tat does not directly participate in the C/EBP-DNA complexes or that Tat dissociates from the DNA-binding complexes due to the electrical field of EMSAs. These possibilities warrant further studies.The data are consistent with the possibility that Tat may function on heterologous genes by interacting with RNA structures possibly present in a large number of cellular and viral genes, as recently reported (30Scala G.

In addition, Tat may function by forming heterodimers with specific transcription factors. These possibilities dramatically enhance the capacity of Tat to modulate the expression of heterologous genes and to play a major role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated diseases.

Studies on small cohorts of subjects who were exposed to HIV-1 and did not develop HIV-1 infection and individuals who harbored HIV-1 but remained disease-free for long periods (4Nowak M.A. Anderson R.M. McLeann A.R. Wolfs T.F.W. Goudsmit J. May R.M. Science. 1991; 254: 963-969Google Scholar, 5Biggar R.J. AIDS. 1990; 4: 1059-1065Google Scholar) strongly suggest that the development of AIDS may depend on a dynamic interplay between viral and host cellular gene products. Accordingly, in HIV-1-infected subjects there is a deregulated production of cytokines, including the proinflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6) (6Nakajima N. Martinez-Maza O. Hirano T. Breen E.C. Nishanian P.G. Sazar-Gonzalez J.F. Fahey J.L. Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 144-155Google Scholar), which affects the growth and differentiation of lymphoid and mesenchymal cells (7Kishimoto T. Akira S. Taga T. Science. 1992; 258: 593-597Google Scholar) and may contribute to the development of the clinical features of AIDS. Accordingly, IL6 gene transcription is induced in cells infected by HIV-1 (8Breen E.C. Rezal A.R. Nakajima K. Beall G.N. Mitsuyasu R.T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Martinez-Maza O. J.

Nature. 1988; 332: 551-555Google Scholar) and affects RNA processing and utilization by interacting with a transactivating responsive element (TAR) located between nucleotides +1 and + 44 with respect to the initiation site (+1) of viral transcription (16Lapsia M.F.

TAR contains a 6-nucleotide loop and a 3-nucleotide pyrimidine bulge that are essential for Tat activity (18Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A.

Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8875-8879Google Scholar). The 86-amino acid-long Tat contains a highly conserved cysteine-rich region, which mediates the formation of metal-linked dimers in vitro and is essential for Tat function (16Lapsia M.F. Rice A.P. Matthews M.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 283-292Google Scholar, 17Arya S.K. Guo C. Josephs S.F. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Google Scholar, 18Sodroski J. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 229: 74-77Google Scholar). A conserved basic region with 6 arginines and 2 lysines in nine residues, stretching from amino acid 47 to 58, is crucial for nuclear localization, mediates the specific binding of Tat to TAR RNA, and is required for the full activity of Tat (26Shibuya H.

Molecular cloning studies have identified 10 isozymes encoded by 9 different mRNAs (1Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Sheng Y. Biden T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24296-24302Google Scholar, 2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology and biochemical properties, the PKC gene family has been divided into three groups: “conventional” PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) regulated by calcium and diacylglycerols or phorbol esters; “novel” PKCs (ε, δ, θ, and η), which are calcium-independent but diacylglycerol- and phorbol ester-sensitive; and “atypical” PKCs (ζ, and ι/λ), which are insensitive to calcium, diacylglycerol, and PMA. In addition, two related phospholipid-dependent kinases, PKCμ and protein kinase D, share sequence homology in their regulatory domains to novel PKCs and may constitute a new subgroup (3Johannes F.-J.

Several studies with tumor-promoting phorbol esters suggest that PKC modulates neural differentiation. Phorbol esters induce neural tissue from ectoderm in Xenopus embryos (5Otte A.P. Koster C.H.

Overexpression of PKCα or -β in Xenopusembryos enhances neural induction (18Otte A.P. Moon R.T. Cell. 1992; 68: 1021-1029Google Scholar), but little else is known about the identity of specific PKC isozymes that regulate neural differentiation. Recent evidence suggests that PKCε plays a role in neural differentiation and plasticity. PKCε is expressed predominantly in the nervous system and is particularly abundant in the hippocampus, olfactory tubercle, and layers I and II of cerebral cortex (19Saito N. Itouji A. Totani Y. Osawa I. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Ogita K. Tanaka C. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 241-248Google Scholar). Within immunoreactive neurons, it is localized to the Golgi apparatus and to axons and presynaptic nerve terminals (19Saito N. Itouji A. Totani Y. Osawa I. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Ogita K. Tanaka C. Brain Res. 1993; 607: 241-248Google Scholar). PKCε is activated by growth factors that stimulate neural differentiation such as insulin (20Heidenreich K.A. Toledo S.P. Brunton L.L. Watson M.J. Daniel-Issakani S. Strulovici B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15076-15082Google Scholar) and NGF (21Ohmichi M. Zhu G. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 767-772Google Scholar). In addition, in developing chick brain, it is the major isozyme found in nondividing, differentiating neurons (22Mangoura D. Sogos V. Dawson G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 488-498Google Scholar). Further evidence for involvement of PKCε in neural differentiation has come from studies with PC12 cells. PC12 cells are derived from neural crest and, when treated with NGF or fibroblast growth factors, undergo dramatic biochemical and morphological differentiation, developing several characteristics of mature sympathetic neurons (23Greene L.A. Sobeih M.M. Teng K.K. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 207-226Google Scholar). PKC-activating phorbol esters enhance NGF-induced activation of ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, suggesting that PKC modulates responses to NGF (11Roivainen R. McMahon T. Messing R.O. Brain Res. 1993; 624: 85-93Google Scholar, 12Hall F.L. Fernyhough P. Ishii D.N. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4460-4466Google Scholar,24Roivainen R. Hundle B. Messing R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1891-1895Google Scholar). Studies with ethanol-treated PC12 cells helped direct us toward the PKC isozyme responsible for this effect. Like phorbol esters, ethanol increases NGF-induced MAP kinase activation and neurite outgrowth through a PKC-dependent mechanism (11Roivainen R. McMahon T. Messing R.O. Brain Res. 1993; 624: 85-93Google Scholar, 24Roivainen R. Hundle B. Messing R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1891-1895Google Scholar). Ethanol promotes PKC-mediated phosphorylation in PC12 cells by increasing levels of messenger RNA and protein for two PKC isozymes, PKCδ and PKCε (25Messing R.O. Petersen P.J. Henrich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23428-23432Google Scholar, 26Roivainen R. Hundle B. Messing R.O. Jansson B. Jörvall H. Rydberg U. Terenius L. Vallee B.L. Toward a Molecular Basis of Alcohol Use and Abuse. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel1994: 29-38Google Scholar). Recently, we found that overexpression of PKCε, but not of PKCδ, enhances NGF-induced MAP kinase activation and neurite outgrowth (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). These findings establish PKCε as a positive modulator of neurite growth. They also suggest that PKCε mediates the neurite-promoting effect of ethanol and phorbol esters in PC12 cells. However, proof of this hypothesis requires studies with PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors or cells lacking specific PKC isozymes. In the current study, we used specific inhibitors of PKCδ and PKCε to investigate whether PKCε mediates enhancement of neurite outgrowth by phorbol esters and ethanol. To achieve this goal we used dominant-negative inhibitors based on the amino acid sequences for PKCδ and PKCε. This approach is based on the observation that upon activation, PKC isozymes translocate to specific intracellular sites where they appear to bind anchoring proteins, termed RACKs (receptors for activatedC-kinase) (28Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Google Scholar). One such protein that has been cloned is RACK1, which interacts with the C2 domain of conventional PKCs (29Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The sites of interaction between RACK1 and the C2 domain of PKCβ have been mapped, and short peptides derived from these domains inhibit translocation and activation of PKCβ in cardiac myocytes andXenopus oocytes (29Ron D. Chen C.-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 30Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol.

Homology has been noted between the unique first variable region of PKCε (εV1) and the C2 domain of conventional PKCs (32Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Google Scholar), suggesting that, similar to the C2 domain of conventional PKCs, εV1 may contain a binding site for an PKCε-specific RACK. If that is the case, then expression of an εV1 fragment should inhibit PKCε translocation and function. Indeed, recent work has shown that an εV1 fragment and a peptide corresponding to amino acids 14–21 in this region prevent phorbol ester-induced PKCε translocation and inhibition of contraction in cultured cardiac myocytes (33Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe studies with PC12 cell lines that stably express the fragments εV1 or δV1, which are derived from the first variable domains of PKCε or PKCδ, respectively. We found that each fragment selectively inhibited phorbol ester-induced translocation of its corresponding isozyme, indicating that these fragments can function as isozyme-selective translocation inhibitors. NGF-induced MAP kinase phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth were not enhanced by phorbol esters or ethanol in cells expressing εV1, but they were increased by these agents in cells expressing δV1 and in cells transfected with empty vector. These results demonstrate that PKCε specifically mediates enhancement of MAP kinase activation and neurite growth by phorbol esters and ethanol in PC12 cells. NGF (2.5 S) was purchased from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Geneticin (G418), laminin, and poly-l-ornithine (30–70 kDa) were purchased from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG from Boehringer Mannheim, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG from Cappel (Durham, NC), anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-Flag M2 antibody from Eastman Kodak Co. PC12 cells, originally obtained from Dr. John A. Wagner (Cornell University, New York, NY), were cultured in plastic tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, in a humidified atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2. For studies of neurite outgrowth, cells were plated at a density of 30–40 × 103 cells/well on 24-well plastic culture plates pretreated for 1 h with poly-l-ornithine (100 μg/ml in 15 mm sodium borate, pH 8.4). In some experiments, cells were plated at a density of 20 × 103 cells/well in 8-well glass chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) treated first with poly-l-ornithine and then laminin (30 μg/ml) overnight. Cells were cultured in medium containing 50 ng/ml of NGF for 4 days, and neurites were measured as described previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). Ethanol-treated cultures were wrapped in Parafilm to prevent evaporation of ethanol, as in prior studies (24Roivainen R. Hundle B. Messing R.O. Proc.

Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated for 2 h in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated 48 h at 4 °C in PBS containing 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2 μg/ml of rabbit anti-PKCε antibody (34Kiley S.C. Parker P.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1003-1016Google Scholar) provided by Dr. Susan C. Kiley (W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Lake Placid, NY). Cells were washed three times in PBS, and immunoreactivity was detected using fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). Images were detected using a liquid-cooled CCD camera (Photometrics Ltd., Tucson, AZ) fitted with a Thompson 7883 chip (384 × 576 pixels) attached to an Olympus IMT-2 inverted microscope equipped with a × 60 1.3 numerical aperture objective. Exposure times were 0.5 s, and images were stored on an Apple Macintosh Quadra 950 computer. Fluorescence intensity in growth cones and cytoplasm was measured using the program BDS Image (Oncor Imaging Systems, Gaithersburg, MD). To detect PKCδ immunoreactivity, cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody against PKCδ (0.2 μg/ml) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) as described previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence in 0.5-μm optical sections was detected with a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a Nikon × 60, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Nuclei were stained by incubating cells in PBS containing 2 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 μmTOTO-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at 25 °C. After three washes in PBS, slides were dried, and coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector, Burlingame, CA). TOTO-3 immunofluorescence was detected by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Images were analyzed in BDS Image to measure the area of each nucleus at its widest diameter. The plasmid pDM27 (33Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Google Scholar), containing a Flag-epitope tag followed by the sequence encoding amino acids 2–144 of PKCε was used to amplify a 480-base pair fragment containing aNotI site at the 5′-end and a XbaI site at the 3′-end. This amplified fragment, containing an ATG start codon, the Flag epitope sequence, and the PKCε sequence, was subcloned into theNotI and XbaI sites of pRc/RSV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) to generate the plasmid pRεV-1. Another plasmid, pDM68 (33Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.-H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Google Scholar), containing the Flag epitope followed by the sequence encoding amino acids 2–144 of PKCδ was used to amplify and subclone a homologous Flag-tagged PKCδ sequence into pRc/RSV to generate the plasmid pRδV-1. PC12 cells (107) were suspended in 0.5 ml of Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, and were electroporated with 80 μg of pRεV-1, pRδV-1, or pRc/RSV as described previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). Geneticin was initially added at 400 μg/ml to select clones and later was added at 200 μg/ml to maintain cultures. For each vector, 46 clones were selected, expanded, and then examined for expression of Flag-tagged PKC fragment mRNA using RT-PCR and for Flag immunoreactivity by Western analysis. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from 106cells using a Micro-Fast Track mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Reverse transcription was carried out with 100 ng of mRNA using a Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) RT-PCR kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Amplification of cDNA was achieved using the forward primer (5′-ACACTGGCGGCCGCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGAT-3′) and the reverse primers 5′-AGCGAGCTCTAGATCGTTCTTCATTGTCTTTA-3′ for pRεV-1, and 5′-ACAGACCTCTAGAGCGGTTCATAGTTGGGAA-3′ for pRδV-1. These primers were designed to specifically amplify the Flag-V1 sequences and not the V1 sequences of endogenous PKCδ and PKCε in cells. Samples were heated to 94 °C, and amplification was started by the addition ofTaq DNA polymerase. The amplification cycle was as follows: annealing for 45 s at 48 °C; elongation for 2 min at 72 °C, and denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C. Amplification was repeated for 30 cycles. To detect expression of Flag-tagged peptides, cells were cultured on poly-l-ornithine-coated, 100-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 6 × 106cells/dish. Medium was removed, and cells were rinsed twice at 4 °C with buffer A (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmglucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Cells were scraped into 1 ml of buffer A containing 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then were frozen on dry ice. Concentrated 5 × sample buffer was added to 400-μl frozen samples to yield a final solution containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 12.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue. Samples were heated at 90 °C for 10 min, passed five times through a 26-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Samples (80 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 14% gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred for 2 h at 4 °C to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham Corp.). Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 3% nonfat dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl). Blots were then incubated with anti-Flag M2 antibody (10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 25 °C. Blots were washed three times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for two minutes and then were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:1000 dilution) in blocking solution overnight at 25 °C. Blots were washed three times for 15 min in TBS-T and once with TBS. Immunoreactive bands were detected with the ECL kit from Amersham. Activation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases was assayed with a phospho-specific 42/44-kDa MAP kinase rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a phosphotyrosine peptide corresponding to residues 196–209 of human ERK1. The antibody detects phosphorylation of ERK1 at tyrosine 204, which is required for ERK1 activation (35Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Google Scholar). The antibody also detects phosphorylation of the corresponding activating tyrosine of ERK2. Blots from 11% polyacrylamide gels were washed for 5 min with 25 ml of buffer B containing 58 mmNa2HPO4, 17 mmNaH2PO4, and 68 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Membranes were blocked in buffer B containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% milk (blocking buffer) for 1 h. Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml of anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody in buffer B containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin (incubation buffer). They were then washed three times for 5 min with 15 ml of blocking buffer and incubated with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (1:2000 dilution) in incubation buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. Blots were finally washed three times with 15 ml of blocking buffer, and immunoreactive bands were detected using the Western-Light chemiluminescent detection system from Tropix, Inc. (Bedford, MA). Cells (3–4 × 106) were plated on 100-mm plastic tissue culture plates. After 48 h, cultures were rinsed at 37 °C twice with 10 ml of medium and incubated with or without 30 nm PMA for 2 min. Cells were rapidly rinsed twice at 4 °C with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and then were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold buffer C containing 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were homogenized at 4 °C with 10 strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and the sample was homogenized with 10 additional strokes. An aliquot of 800 μl was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was frozen on dry ice. The pellet was dispersed in 800 μl of buffer C by sonication in a Branson Sonifier 450 for 2 s at a setting of six. Samples of supernatant and pellet suspension derived from 100 μg of crude homogenate were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% gels and analyzed for PKCδ and PKCε immunoreactivity by Western analysis as described previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine IgG standards. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. values, and differences between means were analyzed by ANOVA. Where p < 0.05, the significance of differences between means was evaluated by the Scheffe F-test or the Newman Keuls test. Stably transfected PC12 clones were tested for expression of the first variable domain of PKCδ or PKCε by RT-PCR (Fig. 1 A) and Western analysis (Fig. 1 B). Two clones, V1δ1 and V1δ2, expressing the V1 region of PKCδ (δV1), and two clones, V1ε1 and V1ε2, expressing the V1 region of PKCε (εV1), were expanded for further studies. To determine whether the δV1 and εV1 fragments expressed by our PC12 clones act as PKC isozyme-selective inhibitors, we measured PMA-induced translocation of PKCδ and PKCε to the particulate fraction of these cells. We predicted that if δV1 contains a binding site for a PKCδ-specific RACK, it should inhibit translocation of PKCδ. Likewise, if εV1 interacts with an PKCε-specific RACK, then expression of εV1 should block phorbol ester-mediated translocation of PKCε. In the parent PC12 cell line and in cells transfected with the pRc/RSV vector alone (clone C1), 30 nm PMA stimulated translocation of PKCδ and PKCε to the particulate fraction (Fig.2). In V1δ1 and V1δ2 cells, which express the δV1 peptide, 30 nm PMA stimulated translocation of PKCε, but translocation of PKCδ was reduced in these clones (Fig. 2,A and B). In V1ε1 and V1ε2 cells, 30 nm PMA stimulated translocation of PKCδ, but translocation of PKCε was reduced compared with control cells (Fig.2, A and C). These results demonstrate that δV1 and εV1 fragments selectively inhibit PMA-induced translocation of their corresponding PKC isozymes. We attempted to examine cells by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-Flag antibody to determine the subcellular localization of expressed δV1 and εV1 but were unsuccessful because of high background staining. We next examined the subcellular localization of endogenous PKCδ and PKCε to determine whether their localization was altered by expression of δV1 or εV1. In undifferentiated cells, PKCδ and PKCε immunoreactivity was observed throughout the cytoplasm, as previously reported (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar) and was not altered in clones expressing δV1 or εV1 (data not shown). In PC12 and C1 cells treated with 50 ng/ml of NGF for 4 days, most PKCδ immunoreactivity was observed in the cytosol, asymmetrically next to the nucleus (Fig.3). Less intense staining was seen in a thin perinuclear band and within nuclei. In the majority of V1δ1 and V1δ2 cells expressing δV1, most PKCδ immunoreactivity appeared in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3). In addition, nuclei appeared larger in these cells. This was analyzed further using confocal images of TOTO-3-stained nuclei at their widest diameter. Nuclei were of similar size in PC12 (82.8 ± 1.5 μm2; n = 164) and C1 (88.3 ± 2.1 μm2; n = 145) cells but were significantly larger in V1δ1 (106.4 ± 3.8 μm2; n = 88) and V1δ2 (100.6 ± 2.8 μm2; n = 172) cells (p < 0.05 compared with PC12 and C1 nuclei; ANOVA and Scheffe-F test). Following treatment with NGF, PKCε immunoreactivity was observed in growth cones, neurite shafts, and the cytoplasm of the cell soma in PC12 and C1 cells (Fig. 4), as noted previously (27Hundle B. McMahon T. Dadgar J. Messing R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30134-30140Google Scholar). In V1ε1 and V1ε2 cells expressing εV1, PKCε immunoreactivity was reduced in growth cones and neurite shafts (Fig. 4). This was examined further by calculating the ratio of mean fluorescence intensity of each growth cone and of the cytoplasm at the base of its neurite shaft. In PC12 (0.73 ± 0.02; n = 71) and C1 (0.76 ± 0.02; n = 55) cells, this ratio was significantly greater (p < 0.05; ANOVA and Scheffe F-test) than ratios measured in V1ε1 (0.49 ± 0.01; n = 83) and V1ε2 (0.50 ± 0.01; n = 71) cells. These results demonstrate that εV1 and δV1 fragments alter the localization of their corresponding PKC isozymes in cells undergoing NGF-induced differentiation. In addition, expression of δV1 is associated with an increase in nuclear size. The growth rates of V1δ- and V1ε-expressing clones, parent PC12 cells, and C1 cells were similar before NGF treatment (data not shown). After culture in poly-l-ornithine-treated culture dishes with 50 ng/ml NGF for 4 days, the number of neurite-bearing cells and the length of neurites was similar in all cell lines (Tables I and II). However, in NGF-treated V1ε1 and V1ε2 cells, neither ethanol nor PMA (10 nm) increased neurite length or the percentage of cells that expressed neurites. In contrast, ethanol and PMA increased neurite length and the percentage of neurite-bearing cells in NGF-treated PC12, C1, V1δ1, and V1δ2 cultures. When cells were cultured on glass slides treated with poly-l-ornithine and coated with laminin, the results were qualitatively similar but more dramatic because NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was especially robust following treatment with ethanol or PMA in all but V1ε1 and V1ε2 cultures (Fig. 5, A and B). Therefore, expression of the εV1 fragment, but not of the δV1 fragment, appears to prevent enhancement of neurite extension by PMA or ethanol in NGF-treated cells.Table IPercentage of cells expressing neurites after treatment with NGF plus PMA or ethanolCell lineNGFNGF + PMANGF + ethanolPC1238 ± 157 ± 11-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).60 ± 21-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).C138 ± 156 ± 21-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).60 ± 21-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).V1δ136 ± 156 ± 21-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).62 ± 21-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).V1δ240 ± 159 ± 11-aSignificantly different compared with treatment with NGF alone (ANOVA and Scheffe F-test).62 ± 11-aSignificantly different compared with tre"

We have found that p53DBD binding induces axial bending in all of the response elements investigated. In particular, response elements having a d(CATG) sequence at the junction of two consensus pentamers in each half-site favor highly bent complexes (bending angle is ∼50°), whereas response elements having d(CTTG) bases at this position are less bent (bending angles from ∼37 to ∼25°). Quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assays of different complexes show a direct correlation between the DNA bending angle and the binding affinity of the p53DBD with the response elements, i.e. the greater the stability of the complex, the more the DNA is bent by p53DBD binding. The study provides evidence that the energetics of DNA bending, as determined by the presence or absence of flexible sites in the response elements, may contribute significantly to the overall binding affinity of the p53DBD for different sequences. The results therefore suggest that both the structure and the stability of the p53-DNA complex may vary with different response elements. This variability may be correlated with variability in p53 function.

The results therefore suggest that both the structure and the stability of the p53-DNA complex may vary with different response elements. This variability may be correlated with variability in p53 function. The wild type tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in many key cellular processes (1Lane D.P.

It acts as a transcriptional activator for a number of DNA damage and growth arrest genes includingmdm2, gadd45, and p21/waf1/cip1; the product of the last is directly involved in inhibiting Cdk complexes leading to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase checkpoint (4Barak Y.

In addition to this protective role, p53 also up-regulates the human bax gene, the product of which heterodimerizes with the survival factor Bcl-2 and directly controls the apoptotic process (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Google Scholar). p53 also negatively regulates the transcription of genes that have TATA box-initiated promoters by binding to the protein components of the basal transcription machinery and is thought to be directly involved in checking both viral and eukaryotic DNA replication (9Horikoshi N. Usheva A. Chen J.D. Levine A.J. Weinmann R. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 227-234Google Scholar, 10Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C.

Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Google Scholar). Studies of tumor-derived p53 mutants have shown that they are defective in sequence-specific DNA binding and consequently cannot activate transcription (13Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that sequence-specific DNA binding and transactivation are the key biochemical activities responsible for much of the biological function of p53. Mutations in the p53 protein have been associated with more than half of all forms of human cancers, and the p53gene is thought to be the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer (13Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Google Scholar). Over 1000 tumor-derived mutations have been found in p53, and the vast majority of these mutations are located in the p53DBD and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding (14Harris C.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1980-1981Google Scholar). This fact, supported by many biochemical and molecular genetic experiments, has suggested that p53 function is mediated by its DNA binding activity and transactivation properties (12Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Google Scholar, 15Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O.

Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Google Scholar). p53 response elements differ in details of specific base sequence, but all contain two tandem decameric elements or half-sites, each a pentameric inverted repeat. Most decamers follow the consensus sequence pattern RRRC(A/T)‖(A/T)GYYY, where R and Y are purines and pyrimidines, respectively, and the vertical bar denotes the center of pseudodyad symmetry (17El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar). One copy of these decameric half-sites is insufficient for the functional binding of p53, defined as the ability to transcriptionally activate a nearby reporter gene, but some binding is preserved when the two copies are separated by up to 21 bp (16Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Google Scholar). A cocrystal structure of the p53DBD nucleoprotein complex (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar) has provided valuable insights into the binding specificity of p53 by identifying specific binding contacts (3Ko L.J. Prives C.

Hubscher U. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 207-213Google Scholar). However, since the asymmetric unit contained only a single normally bound p53DBD, many questions remain concerning the multisubunit nature of the full p53 nucleoprotein complex, the determinants of DNA binding specificity, and the overall organization of p53 tetramers bound to the DNA recognition site. A recent study using T4 ligase-mediated cyclization and analytical ultracentrifugation has shown that p53DBD binds cooperatively as a tetrapeptide to an important functional response element, p21/waf1/cip1, and induces substantial bending in the DNA (21Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar). More recent studies from this laboratory have shown that the requirement of DNA bending is maintained in dipeptide p53DBD complexes with several half-sites, which form at lower binding affinities than tetrapeptide complexes with full response elements. 2P. Balagurumoorthy, unpublished results. 2P. Balagurumoorthy, unpublished results. From molecular modeling studies based upon high resolution chemical probe data, we have proposed a structural model for the complex of four human p53DBD peptides with thep21/waf1/cip1 response element. This model has provided a unique insight into the possible roles of DNA flexibility in the sequence specificity of p53 binding and has provided a rationale for the requirement of DNA bending both in the full tetrapeptide complex and in the individual decameric half-sites (22Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Sakamoto H. Gorin A.A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14830-14841Google Scholar). However, none of these prior studies have addressed the relationship between DNA bending and binding affinity in p53 nucleoprotein complexes. In the present work, to further explore the relationships between DNA bending and p53 function, we have used circular permutation gel retardation and quantitative gel band shift assays to study the gel mobility retardation pattern of five biologically important binding sites: the p53 consensus binding sequence, a symmetric 20-bp binding sequence, the p21/waf1/cip1 response element, the ribosomal gene cluster (RGC) sequence, and the SV40 replication origin sequence (23Liu-Johnson H.-N.

The accuracy of bend angles estimated using circular permutation assays has been questioned recently in the case of several bZip proteins including Fos and Jun (28Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5479-5489Google Scholar, 29Sitlani A. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3248-3252Google Scholar) (reviewed by Hagerman (30Hagerman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9993-9996Google Scholar)) whose elongated shape and leucine zipper region differentiates them from most globular proteins. On the other hand, circular permutation assays provide bending angles that are in excellent agreement with results obtained from phasing and cyclization experiments and from x-ray crystallography for many globular proteins such as CAP, Cro, and the TATA-binding protein, and this method has been widely used to estimate DNA bending in such systems (31VanderVliet P.C. Verrijzer C.P. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 25-32Google Scholar, 32Starr D.B. Hoopes B.C. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 434-446Google Scholar). Since the p53DBD peptide has a similar globular conformation (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar), we believe that the circular permutation assay provides a satisfactory approximation to the true induced bending angles for this peptide bound to the various DNA response elements investigated in this work. Our data clearly show that the p53DBD binds with all of these binding sites cooperatively as a tetrapeptide and induces bending of the DNA. However, the bending angle varies considerably with different response elements over the range of 52–25°. Response elements having a d(CATG) sequence at the junctions of their consensus pentamers,i.e. the p53 consensus and symmetric sites and thep21/waf1/cip1 response element, are bent by ∼50°, whereas bending is much less (∼37-∼25°) in the case of the RGC and SV40 response elements, both of which have a d(CTTG) sequence at the pentamer junctions. Our results confirm an earlier report that p53DBD binds response elements cooperatively as a tetrapeptide and bends the DNA (21Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar). In this earlier work, cyclization studies were used to estimate a bending angle of ∼50° in the p21/waf1/cip1 response element; the excellent agreement with the present result for this binding site provides further justification for the use of circular permutation to quantitate p53DBD DNA bending. We also find a positive correlation between the observed bending angles and binding affinities,i.e. the response elements that show higher bending angles also show higher p53DBD binding affinities, while response elements showing lower bending angles show much less binding affinity. A direct correlation between the binding affinity of p53 with various response elements and transcription activation has been observed by Kernet al. (25Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 consensus and RGC response elements have been characterized as distinctly different p53 binding elements; the former binds with certain p53 mutants and enhances transcriptional activity of the reporter genes, while the later does not bind with mutants (33Prives C. Manfredi J.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 529-534Google Scholar, 34McClure W.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 171-204Google Scholar, 35Zhang W. Shay J.W. Diesseroth A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4272-4775Google Scholar). Thus, our findings suggest that DNA bending may be a ubiquitous feature of p53DBD-DNA complexes irrespective of the DNA sequence and imply that the energetics of DNA bending may contribute significantly to the binding affinity of p53. In this event, the change in free energy associated with DNA bending in the p53-DNA complex may fine tune the transcriptional activation of p53-regulated genes. A human p53 cDNA clone encoding amino acid residues 96–308 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using p53-specific primers 5′-ATATCATATGGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTA-3′ and 5′-ATATGGATCCTCACAGTGCTCGCTTAGTGCTC-3′. The amplified product was cloned in the pET12a expression vector (Novagen), and the core DNA binding domain was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were incubated at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.6–1.0 was attained, and 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to induce the expression of the recombinant protein. Cells were harvested after 2 h by centrifugation, lysed in a French press, and sonicated for 2 min in 40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Resource S column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol and was eluted in a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient. The pooled fractions were precipitated by ammonium sulfate addition to 80% saturation and purified further on a Sephadex 75 HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia) in 50 mm bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified p53DBD was checked on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for purity. All of the oligonucleotides used in this study contained a 20-bp consensus p53 binding site in a 30-mer oligonucleotide having XbaI and SalI cohesive termini (Fig. 1 A). The oligonucleotides were synthesized using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidite chemistry and purified on polyacrylamide gel using standard procedures (36Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.95Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were directionally subcloned at the XbaI and SalI restriction sites of DNA bending vector pBend3 (37Kim J. Zweib C. Wu C. Adhya S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 85: 15-23Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were prepared by an alkaline lysis procedure and sequenced to confirm the size and orientation of the insert. The purified plasmids were digested with MluI,NheI, SpeI, EcoRV, StuI,NcoI, and BamHI restriction enzymes to generate DNA fragments having a circularly permuted p53 consensus binding site (Fig. 1 B). The digested fragments were purified on a low melting agarose gel using a Geneclean kit (Bio101). The cohesive end fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment, whereas the blunt-ended fragments were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and then labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase. The labeled DNA fragments were again purified on a native polyacrylamide gel to eliminate traces of free label and other undesired fragments. The labeled DNA fragments were mixed with poly(dI-dC) (200 ng) and incubated with the purified p53DBD in the DNA binding buffer (50 mm bis-Tris propane, HCl, pH 6.8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl) (10 μl) at 4 °C for 40 min. The amount of p53DBD was adjusted such that no more than 50% of the DNA was retarded due to complex formation. The reactions were mixed with 15% Ficoll (2 μl) and loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gel. The gels were run in 0.25 × TBE at 150 V for about 1.5 h, dried, and autoradiographed. p53DBD-induced DNA bending was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using DNA fragments containing circularly permuted binding sites. The relative mobility (RF) of the p53DBD-DNA complexes was defined as follows, RF=CmcomplexCmfreeEquation 1 where Cm represents the migration of the fragments in the gel in centimeters. The lengths of the different probes varied from 145 to 149 bp due to the sequence of the pBend3 polylinker and the difference in labeling procedures (end filling versuskinasing). To adjust for the slight differences in the probe length, the relative mobilities of the p53DBD-DNA complexes were normalized against highest mobility probe. The average relative mobility from three different experiments was plotted as a function of the fractional displacement, defined as the distance in base pairs from the center of the p53DBD response element to the 5′-end of the noncoding strand of the DNA fragment divided by the total length of the fragment. These data, when plotted as relative mobility versus fractional displacement, could be approximated by a least squares fit to a parabolic function of the form y =ax 2 + bx + c. The bending center (y = minimum) was determined by setting dy/dx to 0 and solving for x. To determine bending angles, we have used the mathematical treatment derived by Ferrari et al., where the bend angle θ is determined from the values for a, b, andc, taken from the least squares fit to the quadratic equation, using the following equation: a or (−b) = 2c(1 + cosθ). With this method, the values of θ using a or −b should be identical, and their comparison offers a means for estimating the error in the measured bending angle. The angle of deviation from linearity, α, is related to θ by the equation α = 180° − θ (38Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Google Scholar). The magnitude of the protein-induced DNA bending was also calculated by a semiempirical equation described by Thompson and Landy (39Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Google Scholar). μMμE=coskα2Equation 2 where μM and μE are the mobility of the protein-DNA complex with the binding site at the middle and end of the DNA fragment, respectively, k is a coefficient that depends upon the electrophoresis conditions, and α is the angle of the protein-induced DNA bend. A k value of ∼1 was obtained for our gel electrophoretic conditions using a calibration oligonucleotide having an intrinsic bend of 54°. The magnitude of the p53DBD-induced bend angles were determined using this same value of k. DNA binding affinities of the p53DBD with different response elements were assayed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The 30-mer oligonucleotide duplexes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, purified on a native polyacrylamide gel, and quantitated by UV spectrophotometry, using ε values of 15,500m−1 cm−1, 8,500m−1 cm−1, 12,500m−1 cm−1, and 7,500m−1 cm−1 for the A, T, G, and C residues, respectively. The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The specific DNA binding activity of these preparations was found to be ∼90%. Each labeled oligonucleotide (∼15 pmol) was mixed with poly(dI-dC) (200 ng) and incubated with increasing amounts of the known concentrations of active p53DBD in DNA binding buffer (10 μl) for 40 min at 4 °C. The samples were mixed with 15% Ficoll (2 μl) to facilitate gel loading and electrophoresed on a pre-electrophoresed 7% polyacrylamide gel (29:1, acrylamide:bis) in 0.25 × TBE for 2 h at 8 V/cm at 4 °C. The loading was done rapidly to minimize the equilibration of the complex with the running buffer. The gels were then transferred to Whatman filter paper, dried under vacuum, and exposed to the x-ray film. The same gel was used to quantitate the free and the bound DNA using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). The exposure was adjusted to achieve a linear response of radioactivity with measured band intensities. Radioactivity scattered between the bound and the free bands was counted with the free probe. The quantitation of the different bands was carried out using Molecular Analyst, a Bio-Rad gel analysis software using standard procedures (40Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Google Scholar). The fraction of the free and bound molecules at each protein concentration was calculated by dividing the optical density of the band by the sum of the optical densities in all the bands in the same lane. Since the concentration of the DNA in these reaction mixtures was always ≤15 pmol, it was assumed that [p53DBD]total ≈ [p53DBD]free, so the protein concentration required for half maximal binding is very close toKd(app). The data were plotted in the form of a Bjerrum plot of the fraction of free DNA versusthe log of protein concentration, and the dissociation constants (Kd) were determined as the protein concentration at which half of the free DNA was bound. In determiningKd(app), we chose the disappearance of the free DNA versus protein concentration rather than the appearance of the complex bands to account for any dissociation of the complex during the running of the gel. The free energy of binding was calculated using the relation ΔG 0=−RTln K(app) at 4 °C, and the free energy of bending was calculated from the following equation (23Liu-Johnson H.-N. Gartenberg M.R. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 995-1005Google Scholar). ΔGbend=0.014£(bp)(Δθ)2(kcal/mol)Equation 3 In Equation 3, Δθ is the bending angle in degrees induced by binding of protein to DNA, and £(bp) is the number of base pairs involved in the complex. The DNA is assumed to have a persistence length of 150 bp (41Hagerman P.J. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1503-1535Google Scholar, 42Cairney K.L. Harrington R.E. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 923-934Google Scholar). We have described the cooperative binding of the p53DBD with the response elements using the method of Senear and Brenowitz (43Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Google Scholar) for the two-site cooperative binding of protein with the DNA as described below. In Scheme FS1, k1 andk2 are the intrinsic binding constants to sites 1 and 2, respectively, and k12 is the cooperativity coefficient. The fraction of the molecules [Θ]i that are free, single, and doubly liganded can be written, respectively, as follows, Θ0=11+(k1+k2)[X]+(k1k2k12)[X2]Equation 4 Θ1=(k1+k2)[X]21+(k1+k2)[X]+(k1k2k12)[X2]Equation 5 Θ2=(k1k2k12)[X]21+(k1+k2)[X]+(k1k2k12)[X2]Equation 6 where X is the concentration of the free protein. Plots of the fraction of free and bound DNA versus the log of protein concentrations were fitted to Equations 4 and 6, respectively, and the cooperativity parameter was calculated as described by Senear and Brenowitz (43Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Google Scholar). Using T4 DNA ligase-mediated cyclization assays, our laboratory has previously shown that the p53DBD binds the response elements cooperatively as a tetrapeptide and bends the DNA (21Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar). High resolution chemical footprinting has shown that four p53DBD peptides bind the full 20-bp p21/waf1/cip1 response element DNA in a staggered array, and molecular modeling based upon protein-DNA contacts identified by base-specific chemical probes has suggested that the bound p53DBD must bend the response element DNA to relieve two types of steric clashes among the bound peptides (22Nagaich A.K. Zhurkin V.B. Sakamoto H. Gorin A.A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14830-14841Google Scholar). In the present work, we have used the circular permutation polyacrylamide gel retardation assay (44Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Google Scholar) to confirm and amplify these findings and to examine the DNA bending relationships among different p53 response elements. The gel retardation assay is based on the assumption that static bending in DNA leads to a reduction in gel mobility as predicted by the Lumpkin-Zimm reptation model, in which the mobility of DNA through a gel is a quadratic function of its mean square end-to-end distance (45Lumpkin O.J. Zimm B.H. Biopolymers. 1982; 21: 2315-2316Google Scholar, 46Levene S.D. Zimm B.H. Science. 1989; 245: 396-399Google Scholar). Uniform length DNA fragments show increasingly anomalous electrophoretic mobility on polyacrylamide gels, as the bending locus is moved from the ends to the center of the DNA fragment. Although the relationship between electrophoretic mobility and conformation for protein-DNA complexes is complex, a comparison of the mobilities of circularly permuted p53DBD-DNA complexes allows a relatively precise determination of the DNA bending locus and an estimate of the bending angle (38Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Google Scholar, 47Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2037-2042Google Scholar). Gel mobility retardation data for all circularly permuted fragments containing p53DBD bound to p53 consensus, p21/waf1/cip1, symmetric, RGC and SV40 response elements (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2, A–E. Corresponding plots of relative gel mobility as functions of flexure displacements of different DNA sequences are shown in Fig. 2, F–J. The unbound fractions of the circularly permuted DNA fragments in all of the gels (bands marked as F in Fig. 2, A–E) show similar mobilities on the polyacrylamide gels, whereas the mobilities for bound fractions (bands marked as C) are clearly anomalous. The mobilities are maximum when the bound response elements are near the ends of the fragments (lanes marked as M andB) and minimum when they are near the centers (lanes marked as E). Intermediate mobilities are observed at intermediate positions (lanes marked as Nh, Sp, S, and Nc). In particular, the bound fractions for the p53 consensus, p21/waf1/cip1, and symmetric response elements (Fig. 2, F–H) show much higher migration anomalies compared with RGC and SV40 (Fig. 2, I and J), as is evident also from a comparison of calculated α values for these sequences. Nevertheless, all of the response elements investigated show gel migration anomalies characteristic of protein-induced DNA bending, and the smallest bending angle observed, α = 25° for the SV40 site (Fig. 4, E and J), still represents considerable DNA bending in this complex.Figure 4Titration curves resolved from the gel mobility shift experiments of p53DBD with p53 consensus sequence (A), p21/waf1/cip1 (B), symmetric sequence (C), RGC sequence (D), and SV40 binding sequence (E). The fraction of free DNA averaged from three independent experiments versus the log of p53DBD concentrations has been plotted. The solid linesindicate the theoretical curve generated by fitting the data to Equation 4 (see “Materials and Methods”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The data of Fig. 2 support the interpretation that the observed electrophoretic mobilities depend upon the position of the bound p53DBD within each DNA fragment and hence that the mobility anomalies must be due to DNA bending. However, to ensure that the gel conditions used were not a factor in the apparent differences in mobility, identical experiments were also carried out using 4–1"
https://openalex.org/W1984333207,"Modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) disrupts the cell-cell junctions of the epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. To examine the role of specific PKC isoforms in this process we have created modified LLC-PK1 subclones that express wild-type and dominant negative versions of PKC-α under control of the tetracycline-responsive expression system. Overexpression of wild-type PKC-α rendered the cells more sensitive to the effects of TPA on transepithelial permeability as measured by loss of transepithelial resistance across the cell sheet. Conversely, expression of a dominant negative PKC-α rendered the cells more resistant to the effects of TPA as measured both by loss of transepithelial resistance as well as cell scattering. The properties of both subclones could be modulated by the addition of tetracycline, which suppressed the effect of the exogenous genes. These results indicate that the α isoform of PKC is at least one of the isoforms that regulate tight junctions and other cell-cell junctions of LLC-PK1 epithelia. Modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) disrupts the cell-cell junctions of the epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. To examine the role of specific PKC isoforms in this process we have created modified LLC-PK1 subclones that express wild-type and dominant negative versions of PKC-α under control of the tetracycline-responsive expression system.

These results indicate that the α isoform of PKC is at least one of the isoforms that regulate tight junctions and other cell-cell junctions of LLC-PK1 epithelia. Epithelial cells cover almost all internal and external body surfaces. All types of epithelia are polarized with apical and basolateral surfaces that have different membrane proteins and thereby different functions. The cells thus compartmentalize the tissues of which they are a part. The cells exist in sheets in which individual cells are interconnected by various types of cell-cell junctions, the regulation of which is at play during development, wound healing, and pathological processes such as cancer or chronic inflammation. Therefore, the control of cell-cell junctions and their disruption and reformation is of interest in several fields. The LLC-PK1 cell line (1Hull R.N. Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Google Scholar) offers an advantageous model system for studying this process. The cell line grows subconfluently as islands of adherent cells. Upon reaching confluence, it forms a differentiated epithelial monolayer with functionally intact tight junctions. Treatment of subconfluent cultures with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) 1The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TER, transepithelial resistance; PKC, protein kinase C; tTA, tetracycline-responsive transactivating protein. causes a breakdown of the cell junctions resulting in a more scattered growth pattern. Acute exposure of LLC-PK1 confluent cell sheets to TPA causes a rapid decrease in the transepithelial resistance (TER) to less than 15% of its initial value (2Mullin J.M. O'Brien T.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: C597-C602Google Scholar) because of its effect on one type of cell junction known as tight junctions. We have been interested in the molecular events in this process and have concentrated much of our efforts on protein kinase C (PKC), the molecular target of TPA. PKC has been shown to be one of the process's key components. Treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X inhibits the effects of TPA (3Marano C.W. Laughlin K.V. Russo L.M. Mullin J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 669-676Google Scholar). PKC mediates calcium-induced tight junction assembly (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Google Scholar), and its inhibition prevents the proper distribution of tight junction-associated proteins such as ZO-1 and cingulin (5Nigam S.K. Denisenko N. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Citi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 548-553Google Scholar). One of the issues in PKC-mediated cell junction regulation is which specific isoform(s) is at play. PKC is not a single protein, as the name implies, but a family of proteins with at least 11 different members (6Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 51-98Google Scholar). Although each member or isoform is encoded by a separate gene, they all consist of conserved regulatory and catalytic regions. The isoforms can be divided into four classes based on regulatory properties. The first class, the conventional PKCs α, β, and γ, is regulated by calcium. The second, nonconventional or novel class, is made up of PKCs δ, ε, η, and θ, which are not regulated by calcium. The third class, the atypical PKCs ζ and (λ/ι), is not regulated by calcium or TPA. A recently discovered isoform, PKC-μ, represents a fourth class, which is topologically related to the PKC family but possesses a kinase domain more related to calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases. The complexity of the PKC family and the differential expression of the isoforms suggest that the members serve distinct roles in signal transduction processes. To examine this issue, as it relates to PKC-mediated cell junction regulation in LLC-PK1 epithelial cells, we have begun to modulate the activities of individual isoforms by exogenously expressing wild type and dominant negative versions of the genes in an inducible expression system. LLC-PK1 cells express the α, δ, ε, and ζ isoforms of PKC, and, in this study, we report that alteration of the activity of the α isoform of PKC modulates the integrity of cell-cell junctions as measured by sensitivity to TPA. Expression vectors comprising the tetracycline-responsive expression system described by Gossen and Bujard (7Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) were used to express both wild-type and dominant negative versions of PKC-α. cDNA encoding the entire reading frame of wild-type PKC-α was excised from its original vector (8Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI and recloned into the EcoRI site of the tetracycline-responsive vector pUHD10-3 creating pUHD10-3α. A dominant negative version of the gene was created by in vitro mutagenesis replacing the conserved lysine in the ATP binding domain in position 368 with an alanine. TheXcmI-BsiWI fragment spanning the Lys → Ala mutation was then excised from its expression vector to replace the analogous fragment in pUHD10-3α vector creating pUHD10-3αDN. LLC-PK1 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). When tetracycline was present, its concentration was 1 μg/ml. For transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed, and 5 × 106cells were resuspended in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline in an electroporation cuvette (0.4 cm). 20 μg of pUHD15-1, which encodes the bacterial transactivator tTA, along with 5 μg of a plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin, were added to the suspension. This was subjected to one pulse (300 V; 250 microfarads) in a Bio-Rad electroporator. Cells were then plated onto three 10-cm tissue culture plates, incubated for 1 day, then adjusted to 400 μg/ml hygromycin. 2–4 weeks later, drug-resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and analyzed by transient transfection for tetracycline-responsive expression of a luciferase reporter gene cloned into the pUHD10-3 expression vector. One of the resulting subclones, LLC-PK1tTA, was selected for subsequent constructions, which were to stably transfect the PKC-α expression vectors described above. This was performed by the same electroporation procedure utilizing 5 μg of pSVzeo (Invitrogen) and 1 mg/ml zeocin for selection. Expression of wild-type and dominant negative PKC-α was assessed by Western analysis. Cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were then lysed in Tris-Cl buffer containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and proteinase inhibitors. DNA was sheared to reduce viscosity, and the protein concentration was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. 50 μg of total protein was mixed with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Samples were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and then loaded onto a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. After separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The filters were first treated with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl) with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 3% nonfat milk. This was followed by hybridization in 5 ml of TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 μg of anti-PKC-α antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) for 5 h at room temperature. The blots were subsequently washed in TBST and then incubated with anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham) for 1 h. After washing in TBST, the blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham). Electrical equipment and protocols for electrical measurement have been described before (9Mullin J.M. Peralta Soler A. Laughlin K.V. Kampherstein J.A. Russo L.M. Saladik D.T. George K. Shurina R.D. O'Brien T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 12-22Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were seeded onto Falcon 3102 filter rings (4.2 cm2). On day 4, after which electrical resistance across the cell sheet had stabilized, cells were refed with fresh media, incubated for 1–2 h, and then their initial TER was measured. Cell sheets were then refed with media containing 1.0 × 10−8m TPA, and electrical resistance across the cell sheet was determined through the course of resistance decreases. Measurements were done in triplicate, and all results are representative of at least three experiments. For assessment of cell scattering 3 × 103 cells were seeded in 24-well plates in 1 ml of medium containing 10−8mTPA. Growth patterns were followed by light microscopy and photographed 3 days after seeding. Since we have noted previously that TPA treatment of LLC-PK1 cells is associated with a translocation of PKC-α from the cytosolic fraction of the cells to the membrane fraction (9Mullin J.M. Peralta Soler A. Laughlin K.V. Kampherstein J.A. Russo L.M. Saladik D.T. George K. Shurina R.D. O'Brien T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 12-22Google Scholar), we decided to modulate the activity of PKC-α by exogenous expression of the gene. Because randomly isolated sublines can vary from the parental in any given property, there is consequent difficulty in ascribing any phenotypic change to the expression of an exogenous gene. We chose to avoid the problems of clonal variation by utilizing the tetracycline-responsive expression system of Gossen and Bujard (7Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Google Scholar) to overexpress PKC-α. In the first step, we cotransfected into LLC-PK1 cells a plasmid expressing tTA and a plasmid conferring hygromycin resistance. After screening drug-resistant clones for tetracycline-repressible expression of tTA, we selected a subline, LLC-PK1tTA, for additional experiments. Next, pUHD10-3 PKC-α was transfected into LLC-PK1tTA using pSVzeo (Invitrogen) as a coselectable marker. 20 drug-resistant clones were analyzed for expression of PKC-α, and one was found to have elevated levels. Fig. 1 shows Western analysis of extracts of cells cultured with and without tetracycline, expressing exogenous PKC-α. Parental cells exhibited a single protein of approximately 75 kDa. LLC-PK1α cells grown in the absence of tetracycline exhibited PKC-α levels that were 10–20 times higher. The same subline grown in the presence of tetracycline showed levels that were almost equal to levels in the parental LLC-PK1tTA line. Phenotypically, the cells resemble the parental line, growing as islands of coherent cells. Upon reaching confluence, both the transfectant and the parental line remain a single layer and differentiate into a polar epithelial-like cell sheet with apical and basolateral surfaces. Both lines form dome-like or cystic structures as a result of the vectorial transepithelial transport and the tight junctions of the cell sheet. However, as seen in Fig. 2, not only do domes collapse when treated with TPA, but the transfected cells rapidly round up and begin to detach from the dish. When expression of the exogenous PKC-α was down-regulated by the addition of tetracycline, the normal dome collapse occurred on TPA treatment but not the cell rounding and detaching. The disruption of tight junctions was assessed quantitatively in measurements of TER decreases on TPA treatment. As seen in Fig. 3, cells overexpressing PKC-α showed a more rapid response to all concentrations of TPA tested compared with wild type LLC-PK1. However, when these cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline, TER decreases matched that of the parental line. The presence of tetracycline had no effect on TER decreases in wild-type LLC-PK1 (data not shown).Figure 2Phase-contrast micrographs of LLC-PK1α and its parental line before and after TPA treatment. Panels A and B are confluent cell sheets of LLC-PK1α and the parental LLC-PK1tTA, respectively. Both show morphologically identical single layered cell sheets with abundant dome formation characteristic of differentiated epithelial cell sheets. Panels C and D are LLC-PK1α and LLC-PK1tTA, respectively, 1 h after adjustment of the media to 10−7m TPA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3TER as a function of duration of exposure to TPA. Plotted is the percentage of initial resistance (approximately 300 Ω·cm2) versus time of exposure to TPA. Panel A, which shows TER decreases of LLC-PK1tTA at various TPA concentrations, and panel B, which shows TER decreases of LLC-PK1α (−tetracycline) at various TPA concentrations, together demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity at several TPA concentrations of LLC-PK1α compared with the parental line. TPA concentrations in panels A and B are as follows (in mm): ▪, 10−11; ▴, 10−10; •, 10−9; □, 10−8; ○, 10−7.Panel C shows a comparison of TER decreases in LLC-PK1α in the presence and absence of tetracycline along with that of the parental line at a TPA concentration of 10−8. Cell lines are represented as follows: ▪, LLC-PK1tTA; •, LLC-PK1α (+tetracycline); ▴, LLC-PK1α (−tetracycline). Points were measured in triplicate, and error bars, which represent S.D., are shown when greater than 1%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To generate a subline of LLC-PK1 cells expressing an inducible dominant negative version of PKC-α, we transfected pUHD10-3αDN into LLC-PK1tTA by the same procedure as described above. Fig. 4 shows the Western analysis of four clones that were isolated. Each showed an exogenous protein running 4–5 kDa below the endogenous PKC-α. In all four clones, the exogenous protein was down-regulated significantly by tetracycline. PKC is first synthesized as an inactive unphosphorylated polypeptide. It is first phosphorylated by an unknown PKC kinase and then undergoes two autophosphorylations to generate the active species (10Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar). The kinase-dead dominant negative protein is obligatorily unable to autophosphorylate and therefore displayed a faster electrophoretic migration compared with the endogenous protein. Physiologically, the effect of PKC-αDN was the opposite of its wild-type counterpart. LLC-PK1αDNcells grown in the absence of tetracycline showed a much slower response to 10−8m TPA than did parental counterparts. As seen in Fig. 5, at 1 h of treatment, TERs of LLC-PK1αDN were 80% of their initial value, whereas the parental cells had decreased to 25%. The degree of tetracycline responsiveness of the system is also seen in electrical measurements with LLC-PK1αDN cells grown in the presence of tetracycline which showed responses to TPA nearly identical to those of parental LLC-PK1tTA. We next assessed the effects of PKC-αDN expression on growth patterns of the line. LLC-PK1, like most epithelial lines, grow as islands of coherent cells. Treatment of subconfluent cultures with TPA disrupts the cell junctions that produce this compact architecture. The result is a more fibroblastic growth pattern with individual cells migrating away from the island and a more scattered appearance. Fig. 6 shows the results of TPA treatment of LLC-PK1αDN cells grown in the presence and absence of tetracycline. With expression of PKC-αDNturned off, treatment of cells with TPA induced a scattered growth pattern identical to that of wild type cells treated with TPA (panel B). However, with the expression of PKC-αDN turned on, TPA-induced cell scattering was completely inhibited; that is, growth patterns were identical to either wild type LLC-PK1 or LLC-PK1αDNin the absence of TPA. Protein phosphorylation is the primary mechanism for controlling diverse and complex cellular processes that affect structure, growth, and differentiation. Among the many kinases that are at play in these events is PKC, which often plays a pivotal role in the signal transduction process. Additionally, because PKC is the major receptor for tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as TPA, the long history of tumor promotion research has led to a wealth of information indicating that the modulation of PKC activity is a key step in tumorigenesis as well. The development of an invasive tumor involves a disruption of normal cell-cell junctions that serve to maintain tissue architecture. Additionally, more recent studies have indicated that the mechanism of action of many growth factor receptors involves activation of PKC. This occurs via phospholipase C, which produces diacylglycerol, which binds to and activates the enzyme in the same manner as TPA. The receptor for scatter factor or hepatocyte growth factor, c-Met, is an example of such a receptor, indicating that PKC plays a role in producing a response to this cytokine. Soon following the initial discovery of PKC, the activity was found to consist of more than one species. With the advent of techniques in molecular biology, the family of isoforms has since grown to include 11 members (6Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 51-98Google Scholar). Differences in tissue distribution, subcellular distribution, and substrate specificity suggest that there is a divergence of function among the isoforms. However, despite the abundance of PKC research, little information is available on the roles of individual isoforms. Since inhibitors of the enzyme are not specific for individual isoforms, we and others have begun to address this issue by the use of exogenous expression studies. This technique, which utilizes both wild-type and dominant negative versions of the gene to modulate the activity of specific individual isoforms, is beginning to indicate which isoforms are involved in particular processes. We have begun examining the role of the α isoform in the disruption of cell junctions. Calcium plays an established role in the maintenance of various cell junctions including tight junctions (4Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Google Scholar, 11Jovov B. Lewis S.A. Crowe W.E. Berg J.R. Wills N.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F775-F784Google Scholar), and PCKα is the major calcium-dependent isoform expressed in LLC-PK1 cells. Its activity is essential for v-ras transformation of keratinocytes (12Dlugosz A.A. Cheng C. Williams E.K. Dharia A.G. Denning M.F. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6413-6420Google Scholar), and we have previously noted that, upon TPA treatment, PKC-α translocates from the cytosolic to the membrane fraction. This occurs in a time-dependent manner, which correlates with increased leakiness of tight junctions. Furthermore, in cells chronically treated with TPA, which form uneven cell sheets of single and multilayered areas, PKC-α stays up-regulated in areas in which there is multilayering, which also is where tight junctions are most leaky (9Mullin J.M. Peralta Soler A. Laughlin K.V. Kampherstein J.A. Russo L.M. Saladik D.T. George K. Shurina R.D. O'Brien T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 12-22Google Scholar). Ellis et al. (13Ellis B. Schneeberger E.E. Rabito C.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F293-F300Google Scholar) report that an LLC-PK1 subline that decreases and then rapidly recovers its TER in response to TPA also rapidly down-regulates its PKC activity, whereas a subline whose TER does not recover in the presence of TPA does not down-regulate its PKC. Our results show that a direct correlation exists between activity levels of PKC-α and the sensitivity of LLC-PK1 cell junctions to TPA; that is, up-regulation by expression of exogenous wild-type PKC-α enhances sensitivity, and down-regulation by expression of the dominant negative form decreases sensitivity. Although in vitro studies of PKC show a lack of specificity toward certain substrates, several literature studies have reported that the technique of exogenous expression of individual members of the PKC family produces results specific for individual isoforms. For example, Li et al. (14Li W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Google Scholar) expressed six different isoforms of PKC in 32D cells and reported that only the expression of the δ isoform rendered the cells sensitive to TPA-induced differentiation. In experiments with NIH 3T3 cells, the δ isoform inhibited cell growth, whereas the ε isoform rendered the cells tumorigenic (15Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Google Scholar). Similarly, Baier-Bitterlich et al. (16Baier-Bitterlich G. Überall F. Bauer B. Fresser F. Wachter H. Grunicke H. Utermann G. Altman A. Baier G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1842-1850Google Scholar) reported that only the θ isoform was competent in stimulation of AP-1 activity in T-lymphocytes. This specificity might be explained in part by the fact that isoforms are compartmentalized differently in cells, conferring specificity to given substrates by spatial accessibility. For example, PKC-δ has been localized to the cytoskeleton of HL-60 cells (17Owen P.J. Johnson G.D. Lord T.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 366-373Google Scholar), and PKC-ζ has been localized by immmunoelectron microscopy in Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelia to the region of the zonula occludens and/or zonula adherens (18Dodane V. Kachar B. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 199-209Google Scholar). Transfection of endothelia with antisense PKC-β blocked the phorbol ester-induced increase in tight function permeability normally seen in these cell sheets (19Lum H. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 267: L223-L241Google Scholar). Similarly, overexpression of PKC-β yields an endothelial cell sheet with a dramatically increased effect of phorbol ester on tight junction permeability (20Nagpala P.G. Malik A.B. Vuong P.T. Lum H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 249-255Google Scholar). We have begun to examine other isoforms of PKC in terms of the effect they have on regulating cell junctions in LLC-PK1 and are finding similar results. Our work represents a significant step toward identifying the relevant isoforms of PKC in regulating cell junctions. More work is necessary to identify the mechanism of this regulation. Many putative targets of PKC have been identified which are associated with cell junctions. Among these are c-Raf (21Kolch W. Heldecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahldl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marmé D. Rapp U. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Google Scholar), vinculin (22Lichtfield D.W. Ball E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 1276-1283Google Scholar), talin (22Lichtfield D.W. Ball E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 1276-1283Google Scholar), MARCKS (23Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Google Scholar), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (24Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Google Scholar) and focal adhesion kinase (25Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Google Scholar). PKC-mediated modulation of any one of these might conceivably play a role in reorganizing cytoskeletal structures during TPA-induced cell migration and disruption of cell junctions. We thank Drs. Gossen and Bujard for plasmids making up the tetracycline-responsive expression system and Dr. Shigeo Ohno for the cDNA for wild type PKC-α."

While Rb interacts with both factors, the A subdomain is more important than the B subdomain in directing Rb-mediated repression, and TFIIIB is the principal target of that activity. Studies examining mechanisms by which Rb suppresses cell growth have focused on its interaction with E2F, a transcription factor that is implicated in the expression of genes required during the S phase of the cell cycle (1Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Google Scholar). E2F sites are switched by Rb from positive to negative regulators (2Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Google Scholar). Rb is selectively recruited to promoters through E2F, whereupon it blocks surrounding transcription factors from interaction with the basal transcription machinery (2Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Google Scholar). Hypophosphorylated Rb binds E2F and blocks progression through the cell cycle; phosphorylation of Rb, modulated by cyclin D, releases this block (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on protein-encoding genes, Rb also represses synthesis of rRNA (4Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Google Scholar). This suggests that Rb may slow cell growth by targeting additional pathways. Actively growing cells require ongoing synthesis of a variety of small structural RNAs so that Rb, in exerting its control over cell cycle progression (3Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar), might also inhibit the transcription of at least some polymerase (Pol) 1The abbreviations used are:PolpolymeraseGSTglutathione S-transferasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTBPTATA-binding protein. III-dependent templates. In agreement with this suggestion, White et al. (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar) reported that Rb represses Pol III-directed transcription. Moreover, this repression is entirely independent of promoter structure. This indicates that Rb must interact with one or more of the common components of the Pol III transcriptional machinery to cause this general repression of Pol III-directed transcription. polymerase glutathione S-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TATA-binding protein. Together, these results show that Rb can repress transcription by Pol I, II, and III (2Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Google Scholar, 4Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Google Scholar, 5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). The basis of this transcriptional versatility is not understood. However, sequence comparisons reveal similarities between the A and the B subdomains of the Rb pocket region to TBP and TFIIB (6Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar, 7Kouzarides T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 448-451Google Scholar). Possibly, Rb influences Pol II-directed transcription by mimicking these factors (6Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar, 7Kouzarides T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 448-451Google Scholar). The interaction of Rb with activation domains in Pol II factors may preclude interactions with TBP and TFIIB (2Weintraub S.J. Chow K.N. Luo R.X. Zhang S.H. He S. Dean D.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 812-815Google Scholar). The participation of TBP in both Pol II- and Pol III-mediated transcription, as well as the similarity of a TFIIIB subunit, TFIII B90, to TFIIB, potentially extends this hypothesis to Pol III-directed transcription (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar, 8Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 30-7026Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that the A and B subdomains in Rb might mediate repression of Pol III transcription through interactions with Pol III accessory factors. The general mammalian factors include TFIIIC2, TFIIIC1, and TFIIIB (9Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 6841-6850Google Scholar). TFIIIC2 contains five subunits and binds directly to promoters containing both A and B boxes. TFIIIC1 is less well characterized structurally and stabilizes the binding of TFIIIC2. It also appears to recognize specific sequences in the termination region. TFIIIB, which contains TBP, TFIIIB90, and possibly other subunits, is recruited to the promoter by TFIIIC and facilitates Pol III recruitment. Primer extension with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to assay transcripts from a basal Alu template, Alu-T, in transiently transfected 293 cells (10Chu W.-M. Liu W.-M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Google Scholar). Calcium phosphate was used for transient transfection; RNA was isolated after 48 h in all transient assays (10Chu W.-M. Liu W.-M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Google Scholar). For U6 RNA, a marked gene (Su+C) was used for transient transfection (11Datta B. Weiner A.

Cloned constructs to transiently express full-length Rb proteins having these same substitutions are identified under “Experimental Procedures.” Human 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell lines 2GR and HGR, which stably express exogenous wild type Rb protein, were derived from 293 and HeLa cells, respectively, by G418 selection after transfection with a construct, HubAcpr-Rb, expressing Rb (12Fung Y.-K.T.

Overexpression of Rb in these cell lines was verified by Western analysis. Cell lines 293 and 2GR were grown in medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and 50 μg/ml of G418 for 2GR cells.

TFIIIB was immunopurified from the nuclear extract prepared from the FLAG-tagged human TBP expressed in HeLa cells, and FLAG-tagged TFIIIB90 was expressed in insect Sf9 cells and immunopurified (8Wang Z.

Transcription reactions were performed at 30 °C for 1 h with 10 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts (9 μg/μl) with either 500 ng (Alu, U6, 7SK, and tRNA) or 250 μg (7SL, 5S, or VA1) of supercoiled template DNA in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. These reaction mixtures contained 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 600 μm each ATP, GTP, and CTP, 40 μm UTP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 2 μg of α-amanitin/ml. Following incubation, 30 μl of stop solution (0.4 m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 500 μg/ml of yeast tRNA) were added, and the mixture was extracted with phenol and chloroform and ethanol-precipitated. Precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gel with 7 m urea. Certain transcription assays included either purified Rb GST-fusion proteins, TFIIIC2, TFIIIB, TFIIIC1, or P11 fractions (8Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plasmids tested for Pol III-transcribed promoter activity in vitro include a basal Alu template, Alu-T (10Chu W.-M. Liu W.-M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Google Scholar), and genes for 7SL RNA (20Bredow S. Surig D. Muller J. Kleinert H. Benecke B.J.

Six GST-Rb fusion proteins are examined in this study (Table I). Vectors expressing GST-Rb(379–928) and GST-Rb(379–928;C706F) were kindly provided by Dr. Kaelin (24Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar). Four additional GST constructs were derived from the previously described clones that express Rb sequences having extensive mutations in either the A subdomain or B subdomain, or in both (12Fung Y.-K.T. T'Ang A. Murphree A.L. Zhang F.H. Qiu W.-R. Wang S.-W. Shi X.-H. Lee L. Driscoll B. Wu K.-J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2659-2672Google Scholar, 13Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.K. Israel M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 72-461Google Scholar). The resulting products are GST-Rb(393–928;*A), GST-Rb(393–928;*B), and GST-Rb(393–928;*A,*B), each of which consists of 536 amino acids of Rb encoding sequence fused to GST (Table I). GST-fusion proteins were overexpressed in DH5α cells and purified as described previously (24Kaelin Jr., W.G. Pallas D.C. DeCaprio J.A. Kaye F.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 521-532Google Scholar). To deplete TFIIIC2 and TFIIIB, nuclear extract was incubated twice with GST-Rb(379–928) protein and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and shaken for 2 h on ice. The glutathione-Sepharose beads had been prewashed with buffer D (16Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). One volume of beads was used against 20 volumes of extract in these depletions, which were monitored by Western blots using antibodies directed against TFIIIB and TFIIIC2. Beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used in transcription reactions. Heated P11 fractions (P0.35 and P0.7) were prepared as described previously (18Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1990; 5: 1935-1945Google Scholar, 19Yoon T.-K. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z.-X. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2024Google Scholar, 25Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins described above were incubated with nuclear extract for 3 h on ice, and glutathione-Sepharose beads prewashed with buffer D were added and incubated with shaking for another 2 h on ice essentially as described above. The supernatant was removed, and beads were washed four times with buffer 1 (0.12 m KCl, 20 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with buffer 2 (0.09 m KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). For the TFIIIB90 interaction assay, buffer 1 contained 0.15 m KCl rather than 0.12m KCl. After washing, an equal volume of 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and the sample was boiled and resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred to nitrocellulose, and the resulting Western blot was analyzed by ECL. As indicated, 3–6 μl of antibody were incubated with 100 μl of nuclear extract from HGR or 2GR cells for 3 h on ice. Protein A-Sepharose, prewashed with buffer D, was added, incubated on ice, and shaken for another 2 h. For mock immunoprecipitation controls, the Sepharose was coupled to calf serum. Sepharose was washed four times with buffer 1 and once with buffer 2 and resuspended in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed as described above. Full-length Alu transcripts are normally expressed at very low levels so that an active Alu template (Alu-T clone) serves as a convenient reporter for Pol III-directed transcription in vivo (10Chu W.-M. Liu W.-M. Schmid C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1750-1757Google Scholar). As assayed by primer extension, transient cotransfection of an Rb-overproducing clone greatly decreases the abundance of transcripts derived from a human Alu template (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and5–8). We also observe that transient cotransfection of this Rb-overproducing clone causes a similar decrease in the abundance of transcripts derived from a marked U6 RNA gene (data not shown). The lengths of the primer extension products show that the transcripts result from Pol III-mediated transcription events. Cotransfection with a luciferase reporter controls for transfection and the abundance of endogenous 7SL RNA controls for RNA loading in these experiments (data not shown). Comparison of replicates in the absence (lanes 1and 5) and in the presence (lanes 4 and6) of Rb demonstrate the reproducibility of these observations. These initial results extend those of White et al. (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar) by showing that Rb also represses Pol III transcriptional activity of an Alu template. Extensive mutations to inactivate either the A or B subdomains of the Rb pocket region (see “Experimental Procedures,” Table I) largely abolish Rb-mediated repression of Alu transcription (Fig. 1,lanes 1–5). We have not determined the level of Rb expression in these transient assays since we confirm these differences in activity by more direct in vitro results presented below. However, these initial data suggest that a functional pocket region is required for Rb-mediated repression. Mutation of the A subdomain abolishes Rb mediated cell growth arrest (12Fung Y.-K.T. T'Ang A. Murphree A.L. Zhang F.H. Qiu W.-R. Wang S.-W. Shi X.-H. Lee L. Driscoll B. Wu K.-J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2659-2672Google Scholar). Mutation of the B subdomain interferes with binding to E2F and with Rb's protection against apoptosis (13Haas-Kogan D.A. Kogan S.C. Levi D. Dazin P. T'Ang A. Fung Y.K. Israel M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 72-461Google Scholar). We tested the effects of purified recombinant Rb upon Pol III-directed transcription in vitro. An Alu template, clone Alu-T, is actively transcribed in nuclear extracts (Fig. 2). Purified GST-Rb(379–928) inhibits this transcription (Fig. 2, compare lane 1 tolanes 2–5 and to lanes 6–9), but high concentrations of GST have little or no effect upon transcription (Fig.2, lane 10 versus lane 1). Thus, we conclude that Rb inhibits Pol III-directed transcription in vitro. Substitution of C with F at position 706 within the B subdomain inhibits Rb's interaction with viral oncogenic proteins (26Kaye F.J. Kratzke R.E. Gerster J.L. Horowitz J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 6922-6926Google Scholar). Although White et al. (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar) reported that this substitution abolishes Rb's repressive activity on VA1 gene transcription, we do not detect a significant difference between the effects of wild type Rb and C706F Rb on Alu transcription (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5 and6–9). As shown below, an Rb protein having an extensively mutated B subdomain also retains partial repressor activity onVA1 gene transcription, so that our results are internally consistent. The GST-Rb fusion protein has no effect on Pol II transcription driven by the adenovirus major late promoter (27Chesnut J.D. Stephens J.H. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10500-10506Google Scholar), providing a negative control for possible nonspecific effects caused by high concentrations of the recombinant protein (data not shown) (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). Thus, Rb specifically represses Pol III transcription. We also find that Rb represses transcription of the 7SK and 7SL RNA genes as well as transcription of tRNA, 5S RNA, and U6 RNA genes (data not shown). These findings both confirm and extend the previous report showing that Rb is a general repressor of Pol III directed transcription (5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). To define regions of Rb that are required for Pol III repression, we tested the ability of mutated Rb-GST fusion proteins to inhibit transcription of the VA1 RNA gene in crude nuclear extracts (Table I; Fig. 3). Transcription of theVA1 RNA gene was repressed by Rb-GST fusion proteins containing either residues 379–928 (lanes 1 and 2 versus lane 5) or residues 393–928 (lanes 12 and13 versus lane 5). Under these assay condition, 100–200 ng of GST-Rb(393–928) is sufficient to achieve 50% inhibition (TableII). Extensive mutation of the A subdomain greatly reduces Rb's repressor activity (lane 5 versus 10 and11; Table II). The effect of mutating both the A and B subdomains is similar to that of mutating the A subdomain alone (lane 5 versus lanes 6 and 7; Table II). In agreement with the previously discussed results of Fig. 2, the C706F substitution in the B subdomain has little effect on repressor activity (lane 3 and 4 and lanes 1 and2). In further support of those observations, extensive mutation of the B subdomain causes only a modest decrease in repressor activity (lanes 8 and 9; Table II). Thus, functional assays show that an intact A subdomain is essential for Rb's repressor activity in vitro, but that the B subdomain may also participate in this activity (see “Discussion”).Table IIInhibition of Pol III-directed transcription in vitro of the VA1 gene by Rb fusion proteinsProtein100 ng200 ng400 ngGST0.96GST-Rb0.680.230.14GST-Rb*A0.790.660.47GST-Rb*B0.710.460.19GST-Rb*A*B0.900.680.54The in vitro transcription experiment of Fig. 3 was independently replicated using lower amounts of the various GST-Rb fusion proteins listed.

Open table in a new tab The in vitro transcription experiment of Fig. 3 was independently replicated using lower amounts of the various GST-Rb fusion proteins listed. PhosphorImager analysis was used to compare the amounts of VA1 RNA relative to that in the control reaction which contained no GST protein. The measured intensity in each case was corrected by subtracting the measured background intensity, which was 0.1 that of the control. Functional assays were employed to test which factors restored transcriptional activity to nuclear extracts that had been inhibited with GST-Rb fusion protein. These extracts were complemented with fractions enriched in Pol III and its accessory factors and tested for transcriptional activity in vitro using an Alu template. In preliminary experiments, crude phosphocellulose fractions were investigated with the following results (data not shown). Addition of the 0.7m KCl phosphocellulose fraction, P0.7, which contains essential factors TFIIIC1 and TFIIIC2 (9Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 6841-6850Google Scholar, 28Yoshinaga S.T. Boulanger P.A. Berk A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3585-3589Google Scholar), completely overcomes Rb-mediated repression. Also, mild heat treatment of P0.7 (15 min at 47 °C), which selectively inactivates TFIIIC1 (19Yoon T.-K. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z.-X. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2024Google Scholar), has no effect on its complementation activity. This result suggested TFIIIC2 as the most likely candidate for the factor in P0.7, which relieves Rb-mediated repression. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the 0.35 m KCl phosphocellulose fraction, P0.35, also relieves Rb-mediated repression, and a mild heat treatment does not affect this activity. Thus, TFIIIB and Pol III, which are the main Pol III factors in the P0.35 fraction (9Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 16: 6841-6850Google Scholar), are also possible targets for the effects of Rb on Pol III transcription. These preliminary findings were further tested in more definitive experiments using purified factors. Addition of either affinity-purified TFIIIB (15Chiang C.M. Ge H. Wang Z. Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2749-2762Google Scholar) or affinity-purified TFIIIC2 relieves the repression of Alu transcription mediated by addition of GST-Rb to nuclear extract (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 1 and2 to lanes 4 and 5 and to lanes 6 and 7). This result suggests that Rb targets both of these factors. Addition of both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 appears somewhat more effective in relieving repression than either factor alone (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 4, 6, and8, and lanes 5, 7, and9). These observations are confirmed by similar functional assays using nuclear extracts which have been partially depleted of Rb-interacting factors by binding to an immobilized GST-Rb(379–928). Western analysis indicates approximately 70% depletion of TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 in these extracts (data not shown). As expected, depleted nuclear extracts are less active than control extracts in transcribing a VA1 RNA gene template (Fig. 4 B, lane 1 versus 5). Addition of either TFIIIB (lane 2) or TFIIIC2 (lane 3) alone, or both together (lane 4), partially restores activity to depleted nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–4). A simple interpretation of these results is that Rb represses transcription by interacting directly with either or both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2. Pull down experiments using mutant Rb-GST fusion proteins were employed to identify both the factors that bind Rb and the sites in Rb responsible for such binding. As assayed by Western blotting with antibody to the 110-KDa subunit, TFIIIC2 in nuclear extract binds immobilized GST-Rb fusion protein, but not GST (Fig. 5 A, lane 2 and6). Rb's direct interaction with TFIIIC2 is demonstrated by binding of affinity-purified TFIIIC2 to GST-Rb (Fig. 5 A,lane 8 versus 7). Extensive mutation of the B subdomain decreases this interaction (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and10 versus lanes 2 and 8), whereas extensive mutation of the A subdomain has much less effect on TFIIIC2 binding (Fig. 5 A, lanes 4 and 9 versus lanes 2and 8). Similarly, we tested for the binding of TFIIIB to these Rb-GST fusion proteins, by Western blot analysis using an antibody against TFIIIB90. We find that TFIIIB in nuclear extract (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–3) and purified TFIIIB (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4–8) bind GST-Rb. Furthermore, Rb directly binds the TFIIIB90 subunit expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 9–12). Extensive mutation of the Rb A subdomain markedly inhibits its interaction with TFIIIB90 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 8and 10), whereas mutation of the B subdomain has little effect (Fig. 5 B, lanes 7 and 9). Consistent with this finding, the C706F mutation in the B subdomain has no effect on TFIIIB binding (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and2). Taken together, these results indicate that Rb binds both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2, with the A domain being primarily responsible for TFIIIB binding and the B subdomain primarily being responsible for TFIIIC2 binding. Since GST pull down experiments are extremely sensitive, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were employed as another test of Rb interactions with both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2. As shown in Fig.6 A, TFIIIC2 coimmunoprecipitates with Rb antibody (lane 2), but not with antibody against La (lane 5) or in a mock immunoprecipitation with protein A (lane 1). A positive control with a GST-Rb pull down shows that GST-Rb(C706F) binds slightly less TFIIIC2 than does wild type Rb (Fig. 6 A, lanes 3 and 4). This observation agrees with the previous conclusion that the B subdomain is directly involved in TFIIIC2 binding. TFIIIB also coimmunoprecipitates with Rb as compared with a mock immunoprecipitation, confirming the results from the GST pull down experiments (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1 and 2). A simple model postulating competitive equilibrium for the binding of TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 to each other and to Rb explains most of the present observations concerning Rb's repression of Pol III activity (Fig. 7) (see “Discussion”). We imagine a two-site model in which the binding of either TFIIIB or TFIIIC2 to Rb displaces the other. Addition of either factor would shift the equilibrium in favor of the TFIIIB-TFIIIC2-DNA transcription complex and at least partially restore activity. We also observed above that the A subdomain is primarily responsible for binding TFIIIB and the B subdomain is primarily responsible for binding TFIIIC2. Accordingly, this two site model further requires that Rb having an inactive A subdomain would be insensitive to TFIIIB addition and Rb having an inactive B subdomain would be insensitive to TFIIIC2 addition. These predictions are substantially confirmed by functional assays (Fig.8).Figure 8Differential effects of purified factors upon repression by mutant Rbs. The clone Alu-T was transcribed by nuclear extract alone (lane 6) or with the addition (500 ng) of either GST-Rb(393–928;*B) (lanes 1–4), GST (lane 5), GST-Rb(393–928;*A) (lanes 7–10), or GST-Rb(393–928) (lanes 11–14) and either purified TFIIIB (20 ng) (lanes 2, 10, and 12), or TFIIIC2 (50 ng) (lanes 3, 8, and 13) or both (lanes 4, 9, and 14). Radiolabeled transcripts are resolved by gel electrophoresis, and the position of Alu RNA is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tested for the ability of purified factors TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 to restore transcriptional activity to extracts which had been inhibited by different Rb proteins having mutated A and B subdomains. Addition of TFIIIC2 almost completely relieves repression by GST-Rb(*A), whereas the addition of TFIIIB has no effect (Fig. 8, lanes 5–10). Conversely, addition of TFIIIC2 has no effect upon repression by GST-Rb(*B), whereas addition of TFIIIB partially relieves repression (Fig. 8, lanes 1–4). In agreement with the previous results, the A subdomain is more important than the B subdomain in directing Rb-mediated repression, and TFIIIB is the principal target of that activity (Fig. 8). However, in this case, addition of both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 is required to completely relieves repression by GST-Rb(*B) (Fig. 8, lane 4). Similarly, the addition of both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 is required to completely relieves repression by GST-Rb (Fig.8, lanes 11–14). The synergistic effects of TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 on Rb fusion proteins having a functional A subdomain provides direct support for this simple thermodynamic model (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 14). The interaction of TFIIIC2 with the B subdomain can partially repress transcription (Fig. 8, lanes 7–10). Yet this same interaction might modulate repression by displacing TFIIIB from its binding to the more important A subdomain. With these qualifications concerning the relative importance of the two subdomains, this competitive two site binding model largely accounts for Rb's activity upon Pol III transcription. As previously noted, Rb represses transcription by Pol I, II, and III (1Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Google Scholar, 4Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Google Scholar, 5White R.J. Trouche D. Martin K. Jackson S.P. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 382: 88-90Google Scholar). The discovery that Rb may, in part, control cell cycle progression by regulating Pol I transcription of rRNAs is surprising, as rRNAs are normally extremely abundant and especially long lived (4Cavanaugh A.H. Hempel W.M. Taylor L.J. Rogalsky V. Todorov G. Rothblum L.I. Nature. 1995; 374: 177-180Google Scholar). Small Pol III directed transcripts, which are often shorter lived and present in limiting amounts, are involved in all aspects of gene expression. In this context, Rb's universal repression of Pol III directed transcription potentially provides a more immediate pathway to slow cellular proliferation. The observation that Rb represses transcription from all known classes of Pol III promoters suggested either that it targets one or more components (Pol III, TFIIIC2, or specific subunits of TFIIIB) that are commonly required for all Pol III genes. Highly purified Pol III failed to relieve Rb-mediated repression (data not shown), suggesting either TFIIIB or TFIIIC or both as likely targets. Purified TFIIIB partially relieves repression by Rb and restores partial activity to nuclear extracts that have been depleted by Rb binding. TFIIIB coimmunoprecipitates with Rb and binds Rb-GST fusion protein, indicating their direct interaction. TFIIIB90 and TBP are sufficient to reconstitute fully functional TFIIIB (8Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 30-7026Google Scholar), suggesting that at least one of the two is responsible for the Rb-TFIIIB interaction. Since Rb does not bind TBP (6Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar) and since Rb brings down the recombinant TFIIIB90 from the sf9 cell extract, we infer that Rb binds TFIIIB90 within TFIIIB. The Rb pocket domain is required for repression, but whereas the A subdomain is essential, extensive mutation of the B subdomain results in only a partial loss of activity in vitro. Also, extensive mutation of the A subdomain impairs the interaction between Rb and TFIIIB. It has been proposed that the resemblance of Rb's A subdomain to TBP provides a molecular basis for understanding how this region might interact with TFIIB (6Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar). However, we do not know if this simple explanation may be extrapolated to the interaction between Rb and TFIIIB90 and whether the Rb A subdomain and TBP simply compete for binding to a common or overlapping site on TFIIIB90. In addition, this interpretation does not explain the roles of either the B subdomain or TFIIIC2. In assays using the VA1 RNA gene, TFIIIC2 partially relieves Rb-mediated repression and partially restores activity to extracts that have been depleted by Rb binding. TFIIIC2 binds GST-Rb fusion protein and coimmunoprecipitates with Rb, supporting the conclusion that this factor also directly interacts with Rb. The B subdomain in Rb is homologous to TFIIB which, in turn, is homologous to TFIIIB90 (8Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 30-7026Google Scholar), suggesting this region as a possible TFIIIC2 binding site. In agreement with this suggestion, the substitution C706F decreases TFIIIC2 binding. Also, while mutation of the B subdomain reduces TFIIIC2 binding, mutation of the A subdomain has no effect on this activity, indicating that TFIIIC2 interacts with the B subdomain. TFIIIC2 contains five subunits and the identity of the subunit which binds Rb remains to be determined. However, as noted, the Rb B subdomain resembles part of TFIIB (6Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Google Scholar) and it is also known that the TFIIB-related TFIIIB interacts with the 102 kDa subunit of TFIIIC2. 3Z. Wang, Y. J. Hsieth and R. G. Roeder, unpublished results. This raises the intriguing possibility that the Rb B subdomain might interact with the same TFIIIC2 subunit required by TFIIIB90. Rb's ability to interact independently with both TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 makes it uniquely suited to repress Pol III-directed transcription. A simple model postulating competitive equilibrium between TFIIIB and TFIIIC2 for binding to two exclusive sites on Rb correctly predicts that the addition of either of the two factors would at least partially relieve Rb-mediated repression (Fig. 7). However, we further observe that addition of either of the two purified factors partially restores activity to extracts that had been partially depleted by Rb binding. Results from these depletion experiments can also be reconciled by this model. The presence of a competing, nonlimiting factor would prevent the complete depletion of the other factor from an extract (Fig. 7). Subsequent addition of either factor could promote more efficient use of the other, thereby partially restoring transcriptional activity. An intriguing implication of this simple thermodynamic model is the possibility that Rb might fine tune Pol III transcriptional activity by differentially titrating TFIIIB and TFIIIC2. As one example, the postulated TFIIIC2-Rb B subdomain interaction might modulate the repression caused by the more important binding of TFIIIB which is primarily directed by the A subdomain. Whether this speculation is correct, a two-site model involving the preferential interaction of the A subdomain with TFIIIB and the B subdomain with TFIIIC2 is required to interpret the internally consistent results from the binding studies and functional assays. We also observe that Rb represses transcription of the U6 RNA gene. The factors which are required for the transcription of the U6 gene are unknown and there is a debate concerning the role of TFIIIB in transcribing this gene (19Yoon T.-K. Murphy S. Bai L. Wang Z.-X. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2019-2024Google Scholar). Conceivably, an altered form of TFIIIB is responsible for U6 RNA transcription and also subject to Rb-mediated repression (8Wang Z. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 30-7026Google Scholar). The involvement of small structural RNAs in all aspects of gene expression identifies Pol III-directed transcription as a particularly attractive target for regulating cell proliferation. p53, another tumor suppressor protein, also represses Pol III-directed transcription (29Chesnokov I. Chu W.-M. Botchan M.R. Schmid C.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7084-7088Google Scholar). However, unlike Rb, p53-mediated repression is restricted to just a few classes of Pol III promoters. Pol III-directed transcription increases gradually through G1 phase, reaching a maximum during S and G2, decreasing as cells enter M, and reaching a minimum in late M (30Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hart P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Google Scholar, 31White R.J. Gottlieb T.M. Downes C.S. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6653-6662Google Scholar). The cell cycle dependence of Pol III activity follows Rb's phosphorylation cycle. Rb is hypophosphorylated in G1, becomes hyperphosphorylated as cells enter S, and is dephosphorylated during M phase (32Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E.

Matsushime H. Kato J.Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Google Scholar). While we have not directly tested the effects of phosphorylation on Rb's interaction with the Pol III transcriptional machinery, our results provide a plausible mechanism through which Pol III activity could be subordinated to cell cycle regulation. Rb may exert control over cell growth through its ability to subject both Pol I and Pol III to cell cycle regulation (38White R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 77-80Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2131246742,"High resolution chemical footprinting and cross-linking experiments have provided a basis for elucidating the overall architecture of the complex between the core DNA binding domain of p53 (p53DBD, amino acids 98–309) and the p21/waf1/cip1DNA response element implicated in the G1/S phase cell cycle checkpoint. These studies complement both a crystal structure and earlier biophysical studies and provide the first direct experimental evidence that four subunits of p53DBD bind to the response element in a regular staggered array having pseudodyad symmetry. The invariant guanosines in the highly conserved C(A/T)‖(T/A)G parts of the consensus half-sites are critical to the p53DBD-DNA binding. Molecular modeling of the complex using the observed peptide-DNA contacts shows that when four subunits of p53DBD bind the response element, the DNA has to bend ∼50° to relieve steric clashes among different subunits, consistent with recent DNA cyclization studies. The overall lateral arrangement of the four p53 subunits with respect to the DNA loop comprises a novel nucleoprotein assembly that has not been reported previously in other complexes. We suggest that this kind of nucleoprotein superstructure may be important for p53 binding to response elements packed in chromatin and for subsequent transactivation of p53-mediated genes.

Wild type p53 is a widely distributed phosphoprotein that has become fundamental in cancer research (1Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Google Scholar, 2Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Google Scholar, 3Levine A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 623-651Google Scholar). It functions as a tumor suppressor and is an essential component in the cell's response to DNA damage (4Selivanova G. Wiman K.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 143-180Google Scholar). It acts as a transcriptional enhancer for a number of DNA damage and growth arrest genes including mdm2,gadd45, and p21/waf1/cip1, the last being involved in the G1/S phase checkpoint (5Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Google Scholar, 6El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

When expressed at high levels, p53 suppresses transformation, arrests cells in G1 phase, and in some cases promotes apoptosis (9Finlay C.A. Hinds P.W. Levine A.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1083-1093Google Scholar, 10Lin D. Shields M.T. Ullrich S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9210-9214Google Scholar, 11Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Google Scholar). Studies of tumorigenic mutants have shown that the majority are selectively located at sites that map directly to the specific DNA binding domain of p53 (12Harris C.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1980-1981Google Scholar). This fact, supported by recent biochemical and molecular genetic evidence, has clearly demonstrated that much of the biological function of p53 is mediated by its DNA binding properties (13Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Google Scholar, 14Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Google Scholar). Wild type p53 binds over 100 different naturally occurring response elements, of which approximately 60 show functionality. It has been estimated that the human genome contains approximately 200–300 such sites (15Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Google Scholar). Response elements differ in details of specific base sequence, but all contain two tandem decameric elements, each a pentameric inverted repeat. Most decamers follow the consensus sequence pattern RRRC(A/T)‖(A/T)GYYY, where R and Y are purines and pyrimidines, respectively, and the vertical bar denotes the center of dyad symmetry (16El-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar). These decameric elements may be separated by as much as 21 bp without complete loss of p53 binding affinity, but functional sites, defined as the ability to transcriptionally activate a nearby reporter gene, evidently follow very closely the consensus decamer pattern with no or only very short intervening spacers (15Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. El-Deiry W.S. Waldman T. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1537-1542Google Scholar). Wild type p53 binds response elements through a sequence-specific DNA binding domain extending from amino acid residue 96 to 308 (13Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X. Marshak D.R. Prives C. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2565-2574Google Scholar). Studies of tumor-derived p53 mutants have shown that they are defective in sequence-specific DNA binding and consequently cannot activate transcription (17Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Google Scholar). These studies have demonstrated that sequence-specific DNA binding and transactivation are the key biochemical activities responsible for much of the biological function of p53. A recent cocrystal structure of a p53DBD 1The abbreviations used are: p53DBDp53 DNA binding domainbpbase pair(s)MES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidbis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol nucleoprotein complex has provided valuable insights into the binding specificity of p53 by identifying specific binding contacts (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar). This important work has had a major impact on thinking about p53 structure-function relationships. However, both the complex size and the binding sequence were necessarily restricted in the cocrystal. Although the oligonucleotide used in the cocrystal contained a full 10-bp consensus half-site (Fig. 1 B), only a single core domain peptide bound specifically with a consensus pentanucleotide, while a second bound nonspecifically 11 bp away and the third did not contact the DNA. Thus, many questions remain. These include the full origin of sequence specificity in DNA binding and the roles of specific p53 response elements, the multisubunit nature of the full p53 nucleoprotein complexes and the overall organization of p53 tetramers bound to the DNA recognition site, and the possible role of conformational changes in both the protein and the DNA as a consequence of complexation. p53 DNA binding domain base pair(s) 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol In the present study, we provide the first report of a structural model for the complex of four human p53DBD peptides with an important functional response element: the p21/waf1/cip1 binding site. This model goes considerably beyond that provided by the earlier crystallographic study and is able to rationalize a number of earlier observations including the requirement for DNA bending in the full tetrapeptide complex. It also provides unique insights into possible roles of DNA flexibility in the sequence specificity of p53 binding and suggests possible relationships between the relative orientation of a tetrameric p53 complex on response element DNA and p53 transactivational function. The model is based on the results of several experiments sensitive to base-specific nucleoprotein contacts between the p53DBD peptides and response element DNA including hydroxyl radical footprinting, missing nucleoside analyses, and methylation and ethylation interference assays. Studies were conducted on a 65-bp oligonucleotide that includes the p21/waf1/cip1 response element; this response element contains both a consensus (Fig. 1 A, boxes 1 and2) and a nonconsensus (boxes 3 and 4) half-site. To facilitate comparison of the present work with the crystallographically determined contact sites (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar), we also studied a 67-bp oligonucleotide containing the same 20-bp binding sequence used in the cocrystal structure, designated in this work as the Cho sequence (Fig. 1 B). Our solution results generally agree with the crystallographic contacts for the Cho sequence, although we find evidence for a second binding site of reverse orientation within this sequence that was not observed in the cocrystal. Our results for thep21/waf1/cip1 site show unequivocally that four p53DBD peptides bind this response element in a staggered array and that each consensus pentanucleotide of the p21/waf1/cip1 site makes specific contacts with the p53DBD and its invariant guanosine nucleotide playing a critical role. Hydroxyl radical footprinting demonstrates structural microheterogeneity in the consensus binding sites, suggesting that sequence-dependent structural variability of response elements plays a critical role in the binding of p53 with DNA. Model building of the p53DBD-p21/waf1/cip1nucleoprotein complex using the results of various chemical probes and footprinting shows that the four bound p53DBD peptides bend the response element by ∼50° to relieve the steric clashes among the bound subunits. This model is in quantitative agreement with recent T4-DNA ligase-mediated cyclization studies (19Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar) and with circular permutation gel retardation assays of the p53DBD-p21/waf1/cip1 complex (20Nagaich A.K. Appella E. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14842-14849Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used in the study (Fig. 1), were synthesized and were purified on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Equimolar amounts of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides were mixed and annealed by heating to 90 °C and slowly cooling down to room temperature. Oligonucleotide duplexes, designed with one base overhang, were uniquely labeled at different ends of both strands. The top strands were labeled at the 3′-end with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and the bottom strand was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase using standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 13.78-13.95Google Scholar). The labeled duplexes were purified once more on 10% native polyacrylamide gels to remove traces of labeled single-stranded DNA and free [γ-32P]ATP. A human p53 cDNA clone encoding amino acid residues 96–308 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using p53-specific primers 5′-ATATCATATGGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTA-3′ and 5′-ATATGGATCCTCACAGTGCTCGCTTAGTGCTC-3′. The amplified product was cloned in the pET12a expression vector (Novagen), and the core DNA binding domain was overproduced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were incubated at 37 °C until anA600 of 0.6–1.0 was attained, and 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to induce the expression of the recombinant protein. Cells were harvested after 2 h by centrifugation, lysed in a French press, and sonicated for 2 min in 40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a Resource S column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 40 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol and was eluted in a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient. The pooled fractions were precipitated by ammonium sulfate addition to 80% saturation and purified further on a Sephadex 75 HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia) in 50 mm bis-Tris propane-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified p53DBD was checked on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel for purity. Single end-labeled oligonucleotide duplexes (5 × 105 cpm, ∼500 ng) were dissolved in a binding buffer containing 50 mmTris-Cl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl (8 μl). Purified p53DBD (4 μg, ∼1:14 DNA:protein molar ratio) was added and the complex was allowed to form for 30 min on ice. Hydroxyl radical cleavage reactions were initiated by adding a mixture containing 8 mmFeS04(NH4)2SO4·6H20 and 16 mm EDTA (2 μl), 0.03% H2O2 (2 μl), and 20 mm sodium ascorbate (2 μl). Reactions were carried out on ice for 2 min and were quenched by adding 0.1 m thiourea (5 μl). Each sample was mixed with 15% Ficoll (4 μl) and was loaded on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.3, as a running buffer. The gels were run for about 1 h at 8 V/cm to separate bound DNA from traces of unbound oligonucleotides. The bound fraction was gel-eluted in 0.5 m NH4Cl, 0.1 mm EDTA, extracted with phenol:chloroform, precipitated twice with ethanol, and run out on a sequencing gel. The control DNA was also cleaved under identical conditions. The labeled oligonucleotides (1 × 106 cpm, ∼1 μg), dissolved in TE buffer, pH 7.6 (70 μl) were randomly gapped by reaction with hydroxyl radicals using a mixture of 1 mmFeS04(NH4)2SO4·6H2O and 2 mm EDTA (10 μl), 0.3% H2O2(10 μl), and 10 mm sodium ascorbate (10 μl). The reactions were carried out on ice for 2 min and were quenched with 0.1m thiourea (30 μl), 0.2 m EDTA (10 μl), 3m sodium acetate (20 μl), and TE buffer (40 μl). The DNA was precipitated by adding 500 μl of ethanol. Each pellet was redissolved in 200 μl of 0.3 m sodium acetate containing 0.2 mm EDTA and was precipitated with 500 μl of ethanol. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, lyophilized, and dissolved in the binding buffer (18 μl). Purified p53DBD (5 μg) was added, and the complex was allowed to form for 30 min on ice. Each reaction was chased for 5 min with a 5 m excess of cold oligonucleotide duplexes to titrate any nonspecific complex formation. The amount of cold oligonucleotides and chasing time was adjusted such that 90% of DNA remained bound. The bound and unbound fractions were separated on a mobility shift gel, as described above, eluted from the gel, precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and loaded on a sequencing gel. The control DNA was also cleaved under identical conditions. Labeled oligonucleotides (1 × 106 cpm, ∼1 μg), were mixed in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA containing sonicated salmon sperm DNA (1 μg) and tRNA (2 μg) and were incubated with 0.5 μl of dimethyl sulfate at room temperature for 2 min. The methylation reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of 1.5 m sodium acetate, 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml tRNA and 750 μl of ethanol. The DNA was precipitated twice with ethanol, dissolved in 50 μl of 0.4m NaCl and reprecipitated with 1 ml of ethanol. The pellet was washed three times with ethanol, dried, and dissolved in 20 μl of binding buffer. Purified p53DBD (4 μg) was added, and the complex was allowed to form for 30 min on ice. Samples were loaded on a mobility shift gel as described above, and the bound and unbound fractions were eluted from the gel, precipitated with ethanol, cleaved with 1m piperidine at 90 °C, and analyzed on a sequencing gel. Control DNA was also treated with dimethyl sulfate under identical conditions and was analyzed on the gel. The labeled oligonucleotides were placed in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA (100 μl) and were mixed with 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Each sample was treated with 100 μl of saturated solution of N-ethyl-N-nitroso urea in ethanol at 50 °C for 1 h. The DNA was precipitated with 20 μl of 3 msodium acetate and 500 μl of ethanol. The pellet was washed with ethanol, dried, and redissolved in 20 μl of binding buffer. Purified p53DBD (4 μg) was added, and the complex was allowed to form for 30 min. Samples were mixed with 4 μl of 15% Ficoll and loaded on the retardation gel. The bound and unbound fractions were eluted from the gels as described previously, ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in 30 μl of sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA. Each sample was treated with 5 μl of 1 m sodium hydroxide at 90 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched with 5 μl of 1m HCl, followed by 1 μl of glycogen solution (10 mg/ml) and 100 μl of ethanol. The DNA was precipitated and washed with 70% ethanol, dried, heat-denatured in formamide, and loaded on a sequencing gel. Purified p53DBD (2 μg) was incubated in the presence of labeled oligonucleotides containing thep21/waf1/cip1 and Cho sequences (Fig. 1, A andB) for 40 min on ice in 20 μl of DNA binding buffer. Increasing concentrations of freshly diluted glutaraldehyde were added for 15 min on ice. Partially cross-linked samples were dissociated by boiling in SDS and were loaded on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was run at 10 V/cm for 2 h and silver-stained to locate the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes. The same gel was dried and autoradiographed, and the DNA bands corresponding to the cross-linked species were located by superimposing the autoradiogram on the gel. p53DBD, used as a control in the experiment, was also treated under identical conditions. The protein molecular weight marker was heat-denatured in SDS and loaded as a control. Labeled oligonucleotides of known concentration were mixed with poly(dI-dC) (200 ng) and incubated with varying amounts of p53DBD in DNA binding buffer at 4 °C for 40 min. The samples were electrophoresed on a 7% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE at 4 °C. Identical unbound oligonucleotides were run in parallel. The bands were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad), and the DNA binding affinities of the samples were determined as described by Careyet al. (22Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Google Scholar). The same gels were later used to determine the stoichiometry of p53DBD binding with the p21/waf1/cip1 and Cho sequences (19Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar). p21/waf1/cip1 and Cho duplexes singly end-labeled at the 5′-end of the bottom strand (3 × 105 cpm, ∼200 ng) were incubated with 12 μg of p53DBD in DNA binding buffer. The complex was allowed to incubate for 40 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the sample was checked on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel to ensure complete saturation of the DNA binding sites with p53DBD. The samples were mixed with 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mmCaCl2 (50 μl) and digested with DNase I (13.2 ng) for 30 s on ice. The digestion was stopped by adding 90 μl of a stop solution (0.2 m NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml tRNA). The samples were extracted with phenol:chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, electrophoresed on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiographed. The control G and G + A cleavage reactions were carried out using the now standard protocol reported by Maxam and Gilbert (23Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Sequencing gels used to analyze the DNA samples contained 12% acrylamide (19:1 ratio of acrylamide:bisacrylamide) and 8 murea. The gels were run for 2–3 h at 1500 V in 1 × TBE buffer, dried, and autoradiographed. Autoradiograms were scanned and analyzed using NIH Image, a public domain gel analysis program, and were quantitated using standard methods (24Dixon W.J. Hayes J.J. Levin J.R. Weidner M.F. Dombroski B.A. Tullius T.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 380-413Google Scholar). To generate stereochemically acceptable DNA structures, the program DNAminiCarlo was used (25Zhurkin V.B. Ulyanov N.B. Gorin A.A. Jernigan R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7046-7050Google Scholar, 26Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 34-48Google Scholar). The generalized coordinates of bases and deoxyriboses served as independent parameters, and the sugar-phosphate chain was closed so that the bond lengths and angles had standard values. Various straight and bent DNA conformations were considered, among them (i) a 20-mer from the p53-DNA complex (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar); (ii) regular uniform B-DNA with identical dimeric step parameters averaged over ∼40 B-DNA crystal structures (26Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 34-48Google Scholar); (iii) nonuniform B-like DNA with the p21/waf1/cip1 sequence, the dimeric steps having sequence-dependent conformations corresponding to the averages taken from ∼40 protein-DNA complexes (26Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 34-48Google Scholar); and (iv and v) bent DNA modeled similarly as in conformation iii but with roll angles in the CA:TG dimers occurring at the junctions between the adjacent pentamers. Specifically, the CA roll angle was 6° in the structure modeled in conformation iii and either 15° (iv) or 20° (v). In the cocrystal structure (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar), this roll angle was 4°, and it is 0° in uniform B-DNA. To account for the rigidity of the sugar-phosphate backbone and the correlation between roll and twist, the CA twist in the latter two structures was reduced from 36° (conformation iii) to 31 and 28° in conformations iv and v, respectively (26Gorin A.A. Zhurkin V.B. Olson W.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 34-48Google Scholar). The protein domains were positioned with respect to the p21/waf1/cip1 response element DNA in the following way. The p53 domain, together with the pentamer GGGCA:TGCCC from the cocrystal structure to which it is bound specifically in that study (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar), was superimposed on a pentamer quarter-site from thep21/waf1/cip1 response element. For this purpose, the C1′ atoms were used; the r.m.s. deviation was never more than 0.6–0.7 Å. Following this procedure, the p53-DNA complexes were analyzed to evaluate the closest peptide-peptide contacts reported here. It was found that, in all cases when p53 domains were bound to unbent DNAs (i.e. with unadjusted CA roll angles as modeled in conformations i–iii), unacceptable steric clashes occurred. By contrast, all clashes vanished in the bent DNA models (iv and v). Hydroxyl radical cleavage (27Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E.A. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Google Scholar) was used to footprint p53DBD complexed with the p21/waf1/cip1 and Cho sequences (Fig. 1, A and B). Fig.2, A and B, shows hydroxyl radical footprinting data for the p53DBD-p21/waf1/cip1 and p53DBD-Cho complexes, respectively. Densitometric plots of the various lanes are shown in Fig. 2, E and F. The top strand of the naked p21/waf1/cip1 response element (as presented in Fig. 1 A) shows reduced cleavage at CATG and TGTT base sequences within the 20-bp consensus binding site, with clear minima at TG sequence elements (marked as arrows in Fig.2 E, plot a) and a higher cleavage at the central CCCAAC bases (Fig. 2 A, lane C; Fig.2 E, plot a). The two TG base elements are separated by 10 bp and hence are spatially in phase along the helix. p53DBD binding shifts the cleavage frequency minimum by one base toward the 3′-end and further diminishes the cleavage frequency at ATGT and TGTT sequences, while the central CCCAAC bases show a relative increase in the cleavage frequency (Fig. 2 A, lane F; Fig.2 E, plot b). The bottom strand exhibits a significantly reduced cleavage at the GTTGGG and GTTC sequences and an increased cleavage at the ACAT and CAT base sequences with maxima at TA sequence elements (marked as arrows in dashed brackets, Fig. 2 A, lane C; Fig.2 E, plot c). The binding of p53DBD further enhances the cleavage frequency of CAT sequence while reducing it in the central GTTG and GTT sequences (Fig. 2 A,lane F; Fig. 2 E, plot d). The unique hydroxyl radical cleavage profiles suggest that thep21/waf1/cip1 response element has narrowed minor grooves at CATG and TGTT sequences and a relatively wider minor groove at the CCCAA sequence. p53DBD binding further narrows the minor grooves involving ATGT and TGTT bases in the two half-sites, compresses the major groove at the GTTGGG bases, and shields their sugar-phosphate backbone from the minor groove side, leading to their reduced cleavage. This may, in turn, further expose the sugar-phosphate backbone of the complementary CCCAA sequence from the minor groove side, making it more susceptible to hydroxyl radical cleavage. x-ray crystallography (28Fratini A.V. Kopka M.L. Drew H.R. Dickerson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14686-14707Google Scholar) and model building (25Zhurkin V.B. Ulyanov N.B. Gorin A.A. Jernigan R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7046-7050Google Scholar) on a variety of DNA sequences indicate that the minor groove width in the ACA‖TGT sequence in the first half-site should be characterized by the distances between sugar moieties of G7 and G4′ and the phosphate distances of G7–T3′ and G4′–T8 and by the similarly positioned nucleotides in the second half-site (Fig.5 A, b). Hydroxyl radical data indicate that p53DBD binding drastically reduces the cleavage frequency in the G7 and T8 in the first half-site and in G17 and T18 in the second half-site (Fig.2 E, a and b), whereas in the bottom strand, the cleavage frequency of G4 and G14′is reduced upon p53DBD binding (Fig. 2 E, c andd). Since hydroxyl radical cleavage is a diffusion-controlled process, the data clearly point to a relatively narrow minor groove in the CATG regions in the two half-sites, which is in accord with the crystal structure data (18Cho Y.J. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar). The higher cleavage at the ACAT and CAT bases in the bottom strand as compared with the ATGT and TGTT sequence at the top strand probably indicates asymmetric distortion of the double helix in this region, leading to differential exposure of the sugar-phosphate backbone of the two strands to hydroxyl radicals. The relatively A/T-rich regions of the consensus binding site, which have narrow minor grooves, are spaced at integral helical periodicity and occur on the same face of the double helix (Fig. 5 A). It is also of interest that GGGC sequences, previously shown to have major groove-directed bending (29Goodsell D.S. Kopka M.L. Cascio D. Dickerson R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2930-2934Google Scholar, 30Brukner I. Susic S. Dlakic M. Sauic A. Pongor S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 26-32Google Scholar, 31Dlakic M. Harrington R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29945-29952Google Scholar), occur in the central region of many functionally important p53 response elements. The helically phased CA:TG sequence elements in the highly conserved region of the consensus binding site have been shown to be kinked in the CAP nucleoprotein complex (32Schultz S.C. Shields G.C. Steitz T.A. Science. 1991; 253: 1001-1007Google Scholar) and may be similarly kinked in other regulatory complexes (33Harrington R.E. Winicov I. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 47: 195-270Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that intrinsic flexibility in these sequence elements may promote the formation of a more stable p53-DNA complex by facilitating specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. A recent study from this laboratory has shown that p53DBD binds thep21/waf1/cip1 response element as a tetrapeptide with high cooperativity and that the DNA is bent by ∼50–60° in solution (19Balagurumoorthy P. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Zambrano N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Appella E. Harrington R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8591-8595Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that a region of compressed major groove, located between two regions of narrow minor groove, as suggested by the present hydroxyl radical footprinting, may provide the structural basis for such a bending. We also observe that there is an inherent asymmetry in the footprinting patterns for the two half-sites, which otherwise might be expected to be identical. We believe that such an inherent asymmetry in the complex may play a crucial physiological role in terms of bending directionality, as in the case of the TATA-binding protein-TATA complex (34Kim J.L. Burley S.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 638-653Google Scholar). The hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns for the Cho sequence (Fig.1 B) and its complex with p53DBD are shown in Fig.2 B, and densitometry plots are shown in Fig. 2 F. The top strand of the unbound Cho sequence shows reduced cleavage at the TCT and the CA sequence elements with"

Analysis of its subunit structure revealed that the native protein is a dimer. Its resolution activity was investigated using synthetic X-junctions with homologous cores. Resolution occurs by dual strand incision predominantly 5′ of CC dinucleotides located symmetrically. A junction lacking homology is not resolved. The efficiency of resolution is related inversely to the number of base pairs in the homologous core, which suggests that branch migration is rate-limiting. Inhibition of resolution at high ratios of protein to DNA suggests that binding of RusA may immobilize the junction point at non-cleavable sites. Resolution is stimulated by alkaline pH and by Mn2+. The protein is unstable in the absence of substrate DNA and loses ∼80% of its activity within 1 min under standard reaction conditions. DNA binding stabilizes the activity. Junction resolution is inhibited in the presence of RuvA. This observation probably explains why RusA is unable to promote efficient recombination and DNA repair in ruvA+strains unless it is expressed at a high level.

Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar). Proteins of this type were first described in bacteriophage-infected bacterial cells (2Mizuuchi K. Kemper B. Hays J. Weisberg R.

Cell. 1982; 29: 357-365Google Scholar), cruciforms (13Lilley D.M.J. Kemper B. Cell. 1984; 36: 413-422Google Scholar), branched structures (14Jensch F. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 181-189Google Scholar, 15Duckett D.R. Murchie A.H. Diekmann S. Kitzing E.V. Kemper B. Lilley D.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 79-89Google Scholar), heteroduplex loops (16Kleff S. Kemper B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1527-1535Google Scholar), and mismatches (17Solaro P.C. Birkenkamp K. Pfeiffer P. Kemper B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 868-877Google Scholar). This broad substrate spectrum is consistent with a role both in recombination and in the removal of branch structures from the phage DNA prior to packaging (18Kemper B. Pottmeyer S. Solaro P. Kosak H.G. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Structure and Methods: Human Genome Initiative and DNA Recombination. Adenine Press, New York1990: 215-229Google Scholar). RuvC protein of E. coli is highly selective for Holliday junctions (19Dunderdale H.J. Benson F.E. Parsons C.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Nature. 1991; 354: 506-510Google Scholar, 20Benson F.E. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5195-5201Google Scholar, 21Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15132-15139Google Scholar), which suggests a more specialized role in recombination. It binds the four-way duplex structure of a Holliday junction and folds the DNA in an open configuration that allows symmetrical strands to be located within the catalytic core of each subunit and cleaved to yield nicked duplex products (22Bennett R.J. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5635-5639Google Scholar, 23Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Google Scholar, 24Bennett R.J. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12217-12222Google Scholar). Strand cleavage has been shown to involve four acidic residues in the protein (25Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Google Scholar, 26Saito A. Iwasaki H. Ariyoshi M. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7470-7474Google Scholar) and occurs 5′ of a T that has to be located within a certain sequence context for efficient resolution (27Shah R. Bennet R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Google Scholar, 28Shida T. Iwasaki H. Saito A. Kyogoku Y. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26105-26109Google Scholar). This sequence-dependence reflects both topological factors that dictate folding of the junction (28Shida T. Iwasaki H. Saito A. Kyogoku Y. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26105-26109Google Scholar) and the need to make specific protein-DNA contacts (29Shah R. Cosstick R. West S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1464-1472Google Scholar). RusA was discovered through its ability to promote recombination and DNA repair in strains lacking RuvC. Genetic analysis of this alternative resolvase provided the first indication that RuvC cannot cleave junctions efficiently in vivo without the associated activities of RuvA and RuvB (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar, 30Mandal T.N. Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4325-4334Google Scholar). These two proteins assemble at junctions to form a highly specialized RuvAB complex that drives the branch point along the DNA (31Parsons C.A. Stasiak A. Bennett R.J. West S.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 375-378Google Scholar, 32Stasiak A. Tsaneva I.R. West S.C. Benson C.J.B. Yu X. Egelman E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7618-7622Google Scholar, 33West S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1237-1241Google Scholar, 34Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Google Scholar). They presumably help RuvC to target cleavable sequences by holding the junction in an open configuration (RuvA) and moving it along the DNA (RuvB), possibly through formation of a RuvABC “resolvasome” complex (34Rafferty J.B. Sedelnikova S.E. Hargreaves D. Artymiuk P.J. Baker P.J. Sharples G.J. Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Rice D.W. Science. 1996; 274: 415-421Google Scholar, 35Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 878-890Google Scholar). RusA has no requirement for RuvAB. However, efficient recombination and DNA repair does need RecG which like RuvAB drives branch migration of Holliday junctions (30Mandal T.N. Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4325-4334Google Scholar, 36Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Mandal T.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 561-573Google Scholar, 37Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Google Scholar, 38Whitby M.C. Ryder L. Lloyd R.G. Cell. 1993; 75: 341-350Google Scholar). Whether or not this reflects a need to locate junctions at cleavable sequences remains to be determined. The 14-kDa RusA polypeptide is encoded by a gene (rusA) located within the defective prophage, DLP12, and is probably of bacteriophage origin (36Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Mandal T.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 561-573Google Scholar). The rusA gene is normally expressed poorly, if at all, and can be deleted with no apparent effect. However, it can be activated to suppress the ruvmutant phenotype by insertion of either IS2 or IS10 (formerly called rus-1 and rus-2mutations, respectively) upstream of the gene to promote transcription, or by cloning in a multicopy plasmid (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar, 30Mandal T.N. Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4325-4334Google Scholar, 36Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Mandal T.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 561-573Google Scholar). Expression from multicopy plasmids is needed to achieve full suppression in the presence of RuvA, which suggests that the binding of Holliday junctions by RuvA can prevent their resolution by RusA (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar, 30Mandal T.N. Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4325-4334Google Scholar). In this work, we detail a new purification of RusA and investigate the native form of the protein. We also report its general biochemical properties, its sequence specificity, and the inhibition of its resolution activity by RuvA. E. coli strain N3757 (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar) is a ΔruvAC65 eda-51::Tn10derivative of BL21 (DE3) plysS (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). pAM151 (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar) is a derivative of pT7-7 carrying rusA+ under control of the phage T7 φ10 promoter (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). RuvA (40Tsaneva I.R. Illing G.T. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 1-10Google Scholar) and RuvC (41Dunderdale H.J. Sharples G.J. Lloyd R.G. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5187-5194Google Scholar) were purified as described elsewhere. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham. All other reagents were from Sigma or BDH and were of analytical grade. Heparin-agarose, Reactive Blue 4-agarose, and double-stranded DNA cellulose were purchased from Sigma. Phosphocellulose P11 was from Whatman, and DEAE Bio-Gel A from Bio-Rad. A pre-packed gel filtration column (Superose 12 HR 10/30) was from Pharmacia. All chromatography was carried out at 4 °C in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1The abbreviations used are:DTTdithiothreitolMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 10% glycerol). Phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride and KCl or NaCl were added to buffer A as indicated. dithiothreitol 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE analysis of protein samples was conducted using 15% gels and followed standard procedures (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, samples were mixed with SDS loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm DTT, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min before electrophoresis. Molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were rabbit muscle phosphorylase b (97,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), hen egg white albumin (45,000), bovine carbonic anhydrase (31,000), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21Takahagi M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15132-15139Google Scholar, 500), and hen egg white lysozyme (14,400). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, or silver-stained as described (43Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Google Scholar). 500-ml batches of strain N3757 transformed with pAM151 were grown with aeration at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani broth containing 10 g/liter NaCl, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At a cell density corresponding to anA650 of 0.5, RusA was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 2 mm and incubating for a further 3 h. The cells were chilled on ice, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol), and stored at −80 °C until required. Under these conditions, RusA was induced to 15–30% of the total cell protein. Frozen cells (70 ml) from 5 liters of induced culture were thawed at room temperature and then mixed on ice with 25 ml of 5 m NaCl, 0.5 ml 200 mm DTT, 1 ml of 10% (v/v) Triton X-100. Preliminary trials revealed that a high salt concentration was required during cell lysis to reduce loss of RusA. Cells were lysed by freezing in liquid nitrogen and rethawing, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C, using a Kontron TST 41.14 rotor. Despite the presence of high salt, ∼70% of the RusA was removed with the cell debris. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Purification of RusA was monitored throughout by SDS-PAGE analysis of column fractions and by assays for junction cleavage activity, using J12 DNA as a substrate. The cleavage assays also provided a measure of nonspecific nuclease contamination. The supernatant (85 ml, 978 mg of protein) fraction containing the soluble RusA was dialyzed overnight against 4 liters of buffer A containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 m KCl, centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min to remove traces of insoluble material, and applied to a phosphocellulose column (2.6 × 8.5 cm, 45-ml bed volume) equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer before eluting bound proteins with a 450 ml of gradient of 0.5–1.0 m KCl in buffer A. RusA eluted between 0.7 and 0.9 m KCl. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that RusA was >90% pure at this stage. Minor protein bands and trace exonuclease contaminants were removed by fractionation on three further columns. The dialyzed phosphocellulose pool (144 ml, 47 mg of protein) was loaded on a DEAE Bio-Gel A column (2.6 × 4.5 cm, 24-ml bed volume) and washed with 50 ml of the same buffer. Bio-Gel A does not bind RusA under these conditions, but retains contaminants that do not fractionate from RusA in later chromatographic steps. The flow-through (∼200 ml, 32 mg of protein) was applied in aliquots of 50 ml to a double stranded DNA-cellulose column (1.0 × 5.1 cm, 4-ml bed volume), washed with 8 ml of buffer A containing 0.25 mKCl, and bound proteins eluted with a 40-ml gradient of 0.25–1.0m KCl in buffer A. RusA eluted between 0.5 and 0.7m KCl. Peak fractions from the four aliquots were pooled (80 ml, 28 mg of protein), dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A, and applied to a heparin-agarose column (1.0 × 7.6 cm, 6-ml bed volume). The column was washed with 12 ml of buffer A containing 0.25m KCl and bound proteins eluted with a 60-ml gradient of 0.25–1.0 m KCl in buffer A. RusA eluted between 0.5 and 0.7 m KCl. No contaminating bands could be detected in these fractions with Coomassie Blue or silver-staining of SDS gels. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol), and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford method, using a protein assay kit from (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (Pharmacia) as standard. Amounts of RuvA, RuvC, and RusA are expressed as moles of the monomeric protein. A 200-μl sample of RusA (1 mg/ml protein) was dialyzed into TEA buffer (20 mm TEA-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), mixed with fresh glutaraldehyde (final concentration 14 mm), and incubated for 1 min at room temperature before storing at −20 °C. RusA (500 μg) was dialyzed for 5 h against buffer A containing KCl at either 0.15 or 1 m and a 300-μl sample applied to a precalibrated gel filtration column. Molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad) were bovine thyroglobulin (670,000), bovine γ-globulin (158,100), chicken ovalbumin (44,000), horse myoglobin (17,000), and cyanocobalamin (1,350). Protein was detected by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer using cyanoethyl chemistry. Each oligonucleotide was deprotected, precipitated in ethanol, and purified on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 7 murea. The bands containing full-length oligonucleotides were cut out and extracted from the gel by soaking in water overnight. X-junctions were made by annealing four partially complementary oligonucleotides, each of approximately 50 nucleotides in length. The point of strand crossover is either fixed centrally within the structure (static junction, J0) or free to branch migrate within a central core of homology (mobile junctions J2, J3, J4, J11, J12, and J26). The number after the letter J indicates the size of the homologous core in base pairs. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for J0 (35Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol.

Biol. 1990; 212: 723-735Google Scholar) have been described. J4 was made by annealing oligonucleotides 5, 7, 9, and 10 (35Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 878-890Google Scholar). J0 has been referred to elsewhere as X-static (35Whitby M.C. Bolt E.L. Chan S.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 878-890Google Scholar) and J11 as junction A (27Shah R. Bennet R.J. West S.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 853-864Google Scholar). Annealing followed the procedures described (46Parsons C.A. Kemper B. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9285-9289Google Scholar). One of the strands was labeled at the 5′ end prior to annealing using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Junctions were purified by nondenaturing 10% PAGE and electroelution. Unlabeled junctions were made as described above, except that oligonucleotides were annealed in equimolar ratios and the resulting substrates were not purified by PAGE. Unlabeled linear duplex DNA was made in the same way using oligonucleotides 1 and 5 described previously (37Lloyd R.G. Sharples G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 17-22Google Scholar). Cleavage of32P-labeled junction DNA by RusA and RuvC was assayed at 37 °C in buffer CB (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% (v/v) glycerol) or SCB (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmDTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% (v/v) glycerol), with either MgCl2 or MnCl2 added as indicated (10 mm in standard resolution reactions). Reactions (20 μl final volume) were terminated by adding 5 μl of stop mixture (2.5% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubating for a further 10 min at 37 °C to deproteinize the mixture. DNA products were analyzed by native PAGE, using 10% gels in TBE (90 mmTris borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried, and labeled products were detected using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Model 425) and by autoradiography. Reactions were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) to analyze PhosphorImages. For time courses, 20-μl samples were removed at intervals from bulk reactions and processed as described. To assess activity over a wide range of pH, assays were conducted in a series of different buffers, each covering a narrow range of pH, with a pH overlap between each buffer type. Separate preparations of junction DNA, each 5′-32P-labeled in a different strand, were incubated with RusA in SCB buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. Deproteinized samples were extracted with phenol, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in sequencing gel loading dye (0.3% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.3% (w/v) xylene cyanol, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 97.5% formamide), and denatured by boiling for 5 min before analyzing by denaturing PAGE, using 12% gels (42Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing ladders of each labeled oligonucleotide generated using a Maxam-Gilbert sequencing kit (Sigma) were loaded on the same gel to provide markers. Gels were dried, and analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImaging. Cleavage sites were mapped by reference to the sequencing ladder. A 1.5-base allowance was made to compensate for the nucleoside eliminated in the sequencing reaction. 32P-Labeled junction DNA (0.2–0.6 ng) was mixed with RusA, RuvA, or RuvC, in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 6% (v/v) glycerol) in a final volume of 20 μl. After 10–15 min on ice, protein-DNA complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE using 4% gels in low ionic strength buffer (6.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were cooled to 4 °C before use, but electrophoresis was at room temperature with continuous buffer recirculation. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. In previous work, we described a recombinant plasmid (pAM151) for the overexpression of RusA and purified some of the protein from strain N3757 transformed with this construct (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar). To obtain larger quantities of the protein for physical analyses, we devised a new purification (“Materials and Methods”). This yielded 24 mg of RusA (in 21 ml) from 5 liters of induced cells. The recovery was much lower than expected given that RusA accounted for 15–20% of the total cell protein. A large fraction of the induced protein was in an insoluble form that was removed with the cell debris during centrifugation of the lysed cells. Subsequent studies revealed that solubility can be improved by growing cells and inducing RusA at 25 °C (data not shown), allowing much better recovery of the induced protein by the same method. The protein purified was free of any visible contaminants as judged by Coomassie Blue and silver staining of SDS gels (Fig. 1A, lane c, and data not shown). To investigate the native form of RusA, 11 μg of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with and without prior boiling in SDS sample loading buffer. The boiled sample showed a single band of RusA (Fig.1A, lane c). It migrates as a 15-kDa species, which is close to its predicted molecular mass of 13.8 kDa (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar). Without boiling, a second band is clearly visible. Its migration suggests a molecular mass of about 30 kDa, which is consistent with a dimer of RusA. A further sample of the protein was treated with glutaraldehyde before boiling in sample loading buffer containing SDS. Fig. 1B shows a 30-kDa protein species in the treated sample (lane b). The only other band visible corresponds to the monomer species seen in the untreated control (lane c). The absence of any other band suggests that glutaraldehyde specifically cross-links a dimer of RusA. The ability to detect a dimer on denaturing SDS gels without prior cross-linking (Fig. 1A, lane b) suggests that a substantial fraction of the purified protein is in this form. To determine the molecular mass, a sample of the native protein was dialyzed against buffer A containing 1 m KCl and applied to a Superose 12 HR column. The elution profile (Fig. 1C) showed a single sharp peak. SDS-PAGE analysis of the fractions confirmed that this peak coincided with the peak of RusA (data not shown). By comparison with protein standards analyzed using the same buffer, the molecular mass of the protein at the peak was determined to be 24 kDa. This is nearly twice the value of 13.8 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence of the protein (36Mahdi A.A. Sharples G.J. Mandal T.N. Lloyd R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 561-573Google Scholar). Given the high salt conditions, this result strongly supports the idea that RusA is a dimer in solution. We also analyzed RusA in the presence of 0.15 m KCl. A substantial fraction of the protein eluted faster than the 670-kDa marker, suggesting a tendency to form aggregates. Previous studies (1Sharples G.J. Chan S.C. Mahdi A.A. Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6133-6142Google Scholar) showed that RusA resolves X-junctions to nicked duplex products. Resolution can be monitored by electrophoresis of the reaction products on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig.2A). Using this simple assay, we investigated the resolution activity of RusA over a range of protein concentrations in reaction buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2. Fig. 2B shows the result of a typical experiment. Resolution is clearly sensitive to the concentration of RusA, peaking sharply at 50 nm in the Mn2+reactions and at 200 nm in the Mg2+ reactions. Above these levels, the activity of RusA is very clearly inhibited. At subinhibitory concentrations, RusA is substantially more active in Mn2+ than it is in Mg2+ (Fig. 2B, inset). This difference disappears as RusA becomes inhibitory. Furthermore, even with 5 μm RusA in the reaction, resolution is not totally abolished. Similar results were obtained using junction J3 (data not shown), although the fraction of junction resolved was generally higher (see below). Autoinhibition in this case reached a lower limit of ∼30% junction resolution (data not shown). To determine the optimal conditions for resolution by RusA, we investigated the activity under a variety of reaction conditions, using J12 with RusA at 100 nm. RusA showed a requirement for divalent metal ions with a broad optimum of 10–30 mm for Mg2+ (Fig. 3A). Replacing Mg2+ with Mn2+ stimulated resolution in the 2–10 mm range, but at 20 mm and above Mn2+ was substantially less effective than Mg2+(data not shown). No activity was detected with Zn2+, Ca2+, or Cu2+. RusA was insensitive to NaCl up to 200 mm, but was inhibited at higher concentrations and inactive at 500 mm (Fig. 3B). Activity in Mg2+ buffer was stimulated at alkaline pH, and increased with increasing pH throughout the range tested (Fig.4A). In contrast, the activity in Mn2+ buffer was optimal at pH 7.5. Up to pH 8.5, it was also significantly higher than in Mg2+ buffer. Fig.4B shows the time course of the reaction in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ under two different buffer conditions, one at pH 7.5 in Tris buffer, and one at pH 9.5 in glycine buffer. As expected, significantly more of the junction was resolved at the higher pH. In both cases the reaction was over within the first 10–15 min even though substantial fractions of the substrate remained unresolved. The failure to cleave all the junction molecules is surprising given that the protein (in terms of dimers) was present in at least a 50-fold molar excess. It means either RusA is inactivated rapidly during the reaction or that a fraction of the junction DNA, determined by the pH, is resistant to cleavage. It could also reflect a combination of these factors.Figure 4Effect of pH on resolution activity of RusA.A, resolution activity was measured over a pH range in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 or 10 mm MnCl2 using the following buffers, all at 40 mm and containing 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin:sodium acetate, pH 5.0 and 5.5; MES, pH 6.0 and 6.5; MOPS, pH 7.0; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5; glycine, pH 9.0 and 9.5.

Endotoxin Res. 1996; 3: 381-393Google Scholar).Although NF-κB/Rel is essential for the LPS induction of iNOS, it is not sufficient (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar, 17Ding A. Hwang S. Lander H.M. Xie Q.-w. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 174-179Google Scholar). Additional transcription factors are required (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), which is consistent with the precedent that at least two-thirds of LPS-induced genes studied have more than one LPS-response element (5Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Google Scholar). In the present work, a second LPS-response element (LREAA) is identified in the iNOS promoter that has not been previously recognized in any gene.DISCUSSIONThe most frequently implicated LPS-response element in mammalian promoters is the 10-base pair κB element (GGGRNNYYCC) that binds transcription factors of the NF-κB/Rel family (5Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Google Scholar, 24Baeueler P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). NF-κB frequently associates with other transcription factors to impart specific regulation (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar). The present work identifies an LPS-response element termed LREAA including the dinucleotide AA downstream of NFκBd in the mouse iNOS promoter. An NF-κB-like binding site followed closely by an LPS-response element containing an AA dinucleotide was reported in the regulatory region of the major histocompatibility complex class II Aαk gene (26Gravallese E.M. Boothby M.R. Smas C.M. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3184-3192Google Scholar) and later in the mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promoter (27Nishizawa M. Nagata S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2002-2011Google Scholar), but in neither gene was the AA dinucleotide noted.The discovery of LREAA focuses attention on the identity of the transcription factors that bind to it and the nature of their interaction with NF-κB. The requisite dinucleotide AA of LREAA is embedded in an octamer-like sequence, ATGCAAAA. This sequence departs from the canonical octamer (ATGCAAAT) at the eighth position. Conversion of the eighth nucleotide from T to A may reduce or abolish the binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1, as evidenced in the human Ig heavy chain gene enhancer, where the Oct-4 element (ATGCAAAA) bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity (28Wang J. Oketani M. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 75-83Google Scholar). Similarly, Oct-1 may bind little to the iNOS LREAA. Other transcription factors known to bind the octamer motif include Pit-1 and the B cell-specific Oct-2 (29Verrijer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 173: 1-21Google Scholar). However, with oligonucleotide probes derived from iNOS promoter and nuclear extracts from RAW cells, antibodies against Pit-1 and Oct-2 had no effect, while the antibody against Oct-1 caused a partial supershift in the two complexes (Z and X) whose formation depended on LREAA. Thus, an Oct-1 likeprotein (OLP) is a candidate for one of the transcription factors interacting with LREAA. UV cross-linking analysis indicated that the LREAA-dependent complex Z included at least three nuclear proteins with molecular masses of ∼160, ∼100, and ∼60 kDa. None of these correspond to the molecular mass of Oct-1 (∼70 kDa). It is not known which, if any, of these three proteins binds anti-Oct-1 antibody to cause a partial supershift of complex Z. The ∼100-kDa species corresponds in size to a component previously detected in complex X (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar). The ∼100 kDa protein that binds the LREAA may be the same as the ∼100 kDa protein that binds NFκBd.Sequence context strongly influences the composition of promoter binding complexes. The practice of using minimal probes to sustain complex formation militates against detecting factors that impart specificity to the induction of genes regulated by widely shared transcription systems such as NF-κB. The present study used relatively long probes. Results with such probes were consistent with findings from reporter constructs including those representing point mutants in the full-length promoter. In earlier work (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar) probe A, containing only the NFκBd element, supported the LPS-activated binding of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel. However, this did not fully explain LPS-induced promoter activity of iNOS. First, activation of NF-κB/Rel is not sensitive to cycloheximide (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), but synthesis of iNOS mRNA in the cells under study was cycloheximide-sensitive (30Xie Q.-w. Nathan C. Transaction of the Association of American Physicians. CVI. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1993: 1-12Google Scholar). Second, activation of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel peaked at 0.5 h after LPS induction and then decreased (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar, 16Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang C.X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; 3: 381-393Google Scholar), but synthesis of iNOS mRNA continued for more than 24 h (11Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Google Scholar, 18Xie Q.-w. Nathan C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 576-582Google Scholar). Finally, NF-κB/Rel was activated by LPS in an LPS-hyporesponsive macrophage cell line from C3H/HeJ mice, but iNOS was not induced. Thus, NF-κB/Rel was not sufficient for LPS induction of iNOS (17Ding A. Hwang S. Lander H.M. Xie Q.-w. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 174-179Google Scholar). In contrast, probes B and D (Ref. 12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar and present study) included not only the NFκBd element but also downstream sequences that appear to be relatively specific for the iNOS gene. The complexes formed with probes B and D after LPS induction were different from those formed with probe A. In particular, complex X required both NFκBd and LREAA, contained additional protein(s) besides those of the NF-κB/Rel family, lacked p65 and c-Rel, and was sensitive to cycloheximide (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar).Sequence analyses suggested that elements for binding of NF-IL6 are present in the iNOS promoter at positions −74 to −66 and −150 to −142 (14Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar); the latter was protected by in vivo footprinting during LPS induction (15Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Leannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar). However, mice rendered genetically deficient in NF-IL6 produced iNOS normally in response to LPS and interferon-γ (31Tanaka T. Akira S. Yashida K. Umemote M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshia N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Google Scholar). Footprinting also showed protection of nucleotide at −58 (within the octamer-like sequence ATGCAAAA) after LPS induction (15Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Leannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates that the dinucleotide AA at −56 and −55 is critical to the formation of complex Z, which is independent of LPS induction, and that the mutation of AA to CG eliminates both protein binding and promoter activity.Based on reporter constructs, binding assays, competition experiments, and antibody supershifts, it is hypothesized that both constitutive complex Z and inducible complex X required LREAA and contained OLP, whereas inducible complexes X and Y required NFκBd and contained NF-κB p50. Since no direct interaction between NF-κB and an Oct-1-containing complex has been reported and since p50 lacks a transactivation domain (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar), it is postulated that LPS causes a distinct protein to bridge p50 and OLP, contributes to the formation of complex X, and either furnishes or recruits the transactivation domain that stimulates transcription of iNOS. The bridging protein may be the ∼100 kDa species that seems common to complex X and complex Z, or the transactivating protein may bind the ∼100 kDa species when it is bound to NFκBd (an LPS-induced event) as well as to LREAA(a constitutive event).Together, NF-κB p50 and the activated OLP-containing complex are proposed to recruit a transactivator to complex X, much as Bcl-3 supplies transactivating capacity by binding p50 dimers on DNA (32Bours V. Franzoso G. Azarenko V. Park S. Kanno T. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Cell. 1993; 72: 729-739Google Scholar,33Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D.

A recent review catalogued 21 mammalian genes induced by LPS, and in 19 of these LPS-response elements have been characterized (5Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Google Scholar). Transcription factors binding to these promoter elements have been identified with the following frequency: NF-κB/Rel, 14 genes; NF-IL6, 9 genes; AP-1, 2 genes; and IL1β-UNF1, NF-1β, NF-βA, c-Jun/ATF2, IRSE-binding protein, NF-M, ATF family members, and c-Jun, 1 gene each. bacterial lipopolysaccharide chloramphenicol acetyltransferase LPS-response element inducible nitric oxide synthase interleukin LPS-inducible genes include NOS2 (iNOS), encoding the high output isoform of nitric oxide synthase (6Xie Q.-w.

Although NF-κB/Rel is essential for the LPS induction of iNOS, it is not sufficient (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar, 17Ding A. Hwang S. Lander H.M. Xie Q.-w. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 174-179Google Scholar). Additional transcription factors are required (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), which is consistent with the precedent that at least two-thirds of LPS-induced genes studied have more than one LPS-response element (5Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Google Scholar). In the present work, a second LPS-response element (LREAA) is identified in the iNOS promoter that has not been previously recognized in any gene. DISCUSSIONThe most frequently implicated LPS-response element in mammalian promoters is the 10-base pair κB element (GGGRNNYYCC) that binds transcription factors of the NF-κB/Rel family (5Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Google Scholar, 24Baeueler P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar). NF-κB frequently associates with other transcription factors to impart specific regulation (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar). The present work identifies an LPS-response element termed LREAA including the dinucleotide AA downstream of NFκBd in the mouse iNOS promoter. An NF-κB-like binding site followed closely by an LPS-response element containing an AA dinucleotide was reported in the regulatory region of the major histocompatibility complex class II Aαk gene (26Gravallese E.M. Boothby M.R. Smas C.M. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3184-3192Google Scholar) and later in the mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor promoter (27Nishizawa M. Nagata S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2002-2011Google Scholar), but in neither gene was the AA dinucleotide noted.The discovery of LREAA focuses attention on the identity of the transcription factors that bind to it and the nature of their interaction with NF-κB. The requisite dinucleotide AA of LREAA is embedded in an octamer-like sequence, ATGCAAAA. This sequence departs from the canonical octamer (ATGCAAAT) at the eighth position. Conversion of the eighth nucleotide from T to A may reduce or abolish the binding of the ubiquitous transcription factor Oct-1, as evidenced in the human Ig heavy chain gene enhancer, where the Oct-4 element (ATGCAAAA) bound octamer-binding proteins with only very low affinity (28Wang J. Oketani M. Watanabe T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 75-83Google Scholar). Similarly, Oct-1 may bind little to the iNOS LREAA. Other transcription factors known to bind the octamer motif include Pit-1 and the B cell-specific Oct-2 (29Verrijer C.P. Van der Vliet P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 173: 1-21Google Scholar). However, with oligonucleotide probes derived from iNOS promoter and nuclear extracts from RAW cells, antibodies against Pit-1 and Oct-2 had no effect, while the antibody against Oct-1 caused a partial supershift in the two complexes (Z and X) whose formation depended on LREAA. Thus, an Oct-1 likeprotein (OLP) is a candidate for one of the transcription factors interacting with LREAA. UV cross-linking analysis indicated that the LREAA-dependent complex Z included at least three nuclear proteins with molecular masses of ∼160, ∼100, and ∼60 kDa. None of these correspond to the molecular mass of Oct-1 (∼70 kDa). It is not known which, if any, of these three proteins binds anti-Oct-1 antibody to cause a partial supershift of complex Z. The ∼100-kDa species corresponds in size to a component previously detected in complex X (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar). The ∼100 kDa protein that binds the LREAA may be the same as the ∼100 kDa protein that binds NFκBd.Sequence context strongly influences the composition of promoter binding complexes. The practice of using minimal probes to sustain complex formation militates against detecting factors that impart specificity to the induction of genes regulated by widely shared transcription systems such as NF-κB. The present study used relatively long probes. Results with such probes were consistent with findings from reporter constructs including those representing point mutants in the full-length promoter. In earlier work (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar) probe A, containing only the NFκBd element, supported the LPS-activated binding of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel. However, this did not fully explain LPS-induced promoter activity of iNOS. First, activation of NF-κB/Rel is not sensitive to cycloheximide (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), but synthesis of iNOS mRNA in the cells under study was cycloheximide-sensitive (30Xie Q.-w. Nathan C. Transaction of the Association of American Physicians. CVI. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1993: 1-12Google Scholar). Second, activation of p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel peaked at 0.5 h after LPS induction and then decreased (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar, 16Murphy W.J. Muroi M. Zhang C.X. Suzuki T. Russell S.W. J. Endotoxin Res. 1996; 3: 381-393Google Scholar), but synthesis of iNOS mRNA continued for more than 24 h (11Lorsbach R.B. Murphy W.J. Lowenstein C.J. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1908-1913Google Scholar, 18Xie Q.-w. Nathan C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 576-582Google Scholar). Finally, NF-κB/Rel was activated by LPS in an LPS-hyporesponsive macrophage cell line from C3H/HeJ mice, but iNOS was not induced. Thus, NF-κB/Rel was not sufficient for LPS induction of iNOS (17Ding A. Hwang S. Lander H.M. Xie Q.-w. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 174-179Google Scholar). In contrast, probes B and D (Ref. 12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar and present study) included not only the NFκBd element but also downstream sequences that appear to be relatively specific for the iNOS gene. The complexes formed with probes B and D after LPS induction were different from those formed with probe A. In particular, complex X required both NFκBd and LREAA, contained additional protein(s) besides those of the NF-κB/Rel family, lacked p65 and c-Rel, and was sensitive to cycloheximide (12Xie Q.-w. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar).Sequence analyses suggested that elements for binding of NF-IL6 are present in the iNOS promoter at positions −74 to −66 and −150 to −142 (14Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar); the latter was protected by in vivo footprinting during LPS induction (15Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Leannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar). However, mice rendered genetically deficient in NF-IL6 produced iNOS normally in response to LPS and interferon-γ (31Tanaka T. Akira S. Yashida K. Umemote M. Yoneda Y. Shirafuji N. Fujiwara H. Suematsu S. Yoshia N. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1995; 80: 353-361Google Scholar). Footprinting also showed protection of nucleotide at −58 (within the octamer-like sequence ATGCAAAA) after LPS induction (15Goldring C.E.P. Reveneau S. Algarte M. Leannin J.-F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1682-1687Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates that the dinucleotide AA at −56 and −55 is critical to the formation of complex Z, which is independent of LPS induction, and that the mutation of AA to CG eliminates both protein binding and promoter activity.Based on reporter constructs, binding assays, competition experiments, and antibody supershifts, it is hypothesized that both constitutive complex Z and inducible complex X required LREAA and contained OLP, whereas inducible complexes X and Y required NFκBd and contained NF-κB p50. Since no direct interaction between NF-κB and an Oct-1-containing complex has been reported and since p50 lacks a transactivation domain (25Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Google Scholar), it is postulated that LPS causes a distinct protein to bridge p50 and OLP, contributes to the formation of complex X, and either furnishes or recruits the transactivation domain that stimulates transcription of iNOS.

https://openalex.org/W2083010342,"Presently, little is known of the amino acid motif(s) participating in bradykinin B2 receptor-mediated signal transduction processes. In this report we investigate the potential role of the two existing tyrosine (Tyr) residues in the intracellular regions and the carboxyl terminus in the regulatory function of this receptor. Rat-1 cells, which do not contain detectable bradykinin B2 receptor, were transfected with wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs. Tyr-131 and Tyr-321 were each mutated to corresponding alanine-, serine-, and phenylalanine-containing sequences. The last 34 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus were truncated. Rat-1 cells transfected with the mutant forms of the receptor cDNA including the truncated COOH-terminal cDNA all bound [3H]bradykinin with essentially the sameKd of approximately 2.2 nm as cells transfected with the wild type bradykinin B2 receptor. However, mutating Tyr-131 resulted in important changes in bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover and arachidonate release. For example, exchanging Tyr-131 for alanine led to an 80% decreased arachidonate release (p < 0.005), 90% decrease in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation (p < 0.001), with receptor uptake at 15 min remaining essentially unchanged. Mutating the same Tyr to phenylalanine resulted in unchanged bradykinin-stimulated IP accumulation, only a slightly lowered arachidonate release, and unchanged receptor uptake at 15 min. Mutating Tyr-321 to alanine resulted in a very different pattern. There was a small but significant reduction in arachidonate release (p < 0.03) and IP accumulation (p < 0.008) with a large, 30%, increase in receptor uptake at 15 min (p < 0.010). Truncation of a portion of the carboxyl tail also proved meaningful, with a 60% decrease in arachidonate release and an 80% decrease in IP accumulation. The truncation also resulted in a large, 130%, decrease in receptor uptake at 15 min (p < 0.023). Taken together, these results point to Tyr-131 as an important element in determining bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate release and IP accumulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation at this site apparently does not play a major role. Tyr-131, Tyr-321, and the carboxyl tail appear to be important in determining receptor uptake. Presently, little is known of the amino acid motif(s) participating in bradykinin B2 receptor-mediated signal transduction processes. In this report we investigate the potential role of the two existing tyrosine (Tyr) residues in the intracellular regions and the carboxyl terminus in the regulatory function of this receptor. Rat-1 cells, which do not contain detectable bradykinin B2 receptor, were transfected with wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs. Tyr-131 and Tyr-321 were each mutated to corresponding alanine-, serine-, and phenylalanine-containing sequences. The last 34 amino acid residues of the carboxyl terminus were truncated. Rat-1 cells transfected with the mutant forms of the receptor cDNA including the truncated COOH-terminal cDNA all bound [3H]bradykinin with essentially the sameKd of approximately 2.2 nm as cells transfected with the wild type bradykinin B2 receptor. However, mutating Tyr-131 resulted in important changes in bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover and arachidonate release. For example, exchanging Tyr-131 for alanine led to an 80% decreased arachidonate release (p < 0.005), 90% decrease in inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation (p < 0.001), with receptor uptake at 15 min remaining essentially unchanged. Mutating the same Tyr to phenylalanine resulted in unchanged bradykinin-stimulated IP accumulation, only a slightly lowered arachidonate release, and unchanged receptor uptake at 15 min. Mutating Tyr-321 to alanine resulted in a very different pattern. There was a small but significant reduction in arachidonate release (p < 0.03) and IP accumulation (p < 0.008) with a large, 30%, increase in receptor uptake at 15 min (p < 0.010). Truncation of a portion of the carboxyl tail also proved meaningful, with a 60% decrease in arachidonate release and an 80% decrease in IP accumulation. The truncation also resulted in a large, 130%, decrease in receptor uptake at 15 min (p < 0.023). Taken together, these results point to Tyr-131 as an important element in determining bradykinin-stimulated arachidonate release and IP accumulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation at this site apparently does not play a major role. Tyr-131, Tyr-321, and the carboxyl tail appear to be important in determining receptor uptake. Bradykinin is a nine-amino acid peptide hormone exerting diverse biological action ranging from a role in the inflammatory process to regulatory effects on vascular permeability, blood pressure, generation of pain, and renal homeostasis (1Regoli D. Barabe J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1980; 32: 1-46Google Scholar, 2Margolius H.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1989; 29: 343-364Google Scholar). Bradykinin expresses its physiological effect through activation of a B2 type receptor. The bradykinin B2 receptor cDNA has been isolated from several species such as mouse, rat, and human (3McIntyre P. Phillips E. Skidmore E. Brown M. Webb M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 346-355Google Scholar, 4McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The receptor is G-protein-coupled with a structure characterized by seven transmembrane regions (4McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7724-7728Google Scholar). Upon binding, the receptor activates a number of enzyme systems involved in signal transduction including phospholipase C and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (6Burch R.M. Axelrod J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6374-6378Google Scholar). When stably transfected into such cells as hamster CCL39 the receptor retains its signal paths (7Taylor L. Ricupero D. Jean J.C. Jackson B.A. Navarro J. Polgar P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 786-793Google Scholar). Investigation of the regulatory regions or domains of the bradykinin B2 receptor which participate in the activation of second messenger responses has been hampered by the unavailability of immunoprecipitating antibodies against the receptor. Herein we target single amino acid and amino acid sequence moieties that could prove crucial to the function of this receptor in signal transduction. These include the two existing tyrosines at positions 131 and 321 and the carboxyl terminus consisting of 34 amino acid residues including four serines and two threonines. We analyze the ability of normal and mutant bradykinin B2 receptors to stimulate inositol phosphate (IP) 1The abbreviation used is: IP, inositol phosphate. 1The abbreviation used is: IP, inositol phosphate. production and release of arachidonate. Our results show that tyrosine (Tyr) 131 and 321 and the carboxyl terminus participate variably in function of both paths as well as in receptor internalization. Materials−[3H]Bradykinin (78 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Corp.myo-[1,2-3H]Inositol (45–80 Ci/mmol) and [3H]arachidonate (60–100 Ci/mmol) were obtained from DuPont NEN. Analytical grade Dowex X8 (AG 1-X8, 100–200 mesh) was obtained from Bio-Rad. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from DuPont NEN. Taq polymerase was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized from an in-house Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. All other reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Rat-1 cells were obtained from Dr. Robert Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, MIT) as a generous gift. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All tissue culture dishes were obtained from Fisher Scientific. The overlap extension polymerase chain reaction method was used to generate mutants of the bradykinin B2 receptor utilizing as template the rat bradykinin B2 cDNA clone in the vector pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). For each mutant receptor construct, four oligonucleotides (two flanking and two internal primers) were utilized. The two flanking primers, an upstream primer located 33 base pairs upstream from the start site with an internal HindIII site and a downstream primer designed to contain a stop codon followed by an endonuclease restriction site XbaI, were designed to facilitate subcloning into the HindIII/XbaI site of the plasmid pRC/CMV. The two internal primers were complementary to each other and contained the desired mutant sequences with melting temperatures between 55 and 65 °C. The Tyr at position 131 was altered to either Ala, Ser, or Phe. The Tyr-131 → Ala (Y131A) mutant was constructed using a sense oligonucleotide 5′-tatcgaccgagccctggcgct-3′ and an antisense oligonucleotide 5′-agcgccagggctcggtcgata-3′ (bold letters indicate the nucleotides that were altered). The other bradykinin B2 receptor mutants were constructed using the following: Y131S (sense strand, 5′-atcgaccgatccctggcgctg-3′ and antisense strand, 5′-cagcgccagggatcggtcgat-3′); Y131F (sense strand, 5′-atcgaccgattcctggcgctg-3′ and antisense strand, 5′-cagcgccaggaatcggtcgat-3′); Y321A (sense strand, 5′-agaggtggcccaggcaata-3′ and antisense strand, 5′-tattgcctgggccacctct-3′). The bradykinin B2 receptor-deleted carboxyl tail (DC34) was constructed using a downstream primer containing nucleotide sequences encoding amino acids 327–331, a stop codon, and a XbaI restriction site. Two overlapping fragments from two polymerase chain reactions with paired external and internal primers were mixed for a second polymerase chain reaction as described (8Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-69Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product of the each receptor construct was sequenced to confirm the identity of the receptor mutants. Rat-1 cells were incubated with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H] inositol in 1 ml of growth medium for 16–24 h. Ten min prior to ligand stimulation, cells were exposed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mmLiCl2 and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Cells were then exposed with 10 nm bradykinin for 30 min at 37 °C, and incubations were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 10 mm ice-cold formic acid. Cells were scraped off and the formic acid soluble material isolated by centrifugation and neutralized by adding 10 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate. Total [3H]IPs were extracted using a Dowex AG 1-X8 formate resin in an anion exchange column and eluted with 2 mammonium formate, pH 5.0, as described (9Blount P. Krause J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16388-16395Google Scholar). Following the addition of 4 ml of Ecolite scintillation fluid (ICN Biomedical, Inc., Aurora, OH), samples were counted for radioactivity in a Pharmacia Biotech Inc. liquid scintillation β counter. Rat-1 cells were prelabeled with [3H] arachidonate (0.2 μCi/well) for 16 h as described previously (10Ricupero D. Taylor L. Tlucko A. Navarro J. Polgar P. Mediat. Inflamm. 1992; 1: 133-140Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and incubated with 500 μl of Dulbecco's medium containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (radioimmunoassay grade, Sigma). Cells were then incubated with 100 nm bradykinin for 20 min at 37 °C. Medium was removed and centrifuged at 800 × g. Radioactivity was determined in a scintillation β counter after addition of 2 ml of Ecolite scintillation fluid. Binding studies of bradykinin to intact Rat-1 cells was carried out as described previously (10Ricupero D. Taylor L. Tlucko A. Navarro J. Polgar P. Mediat. Inflamm. 1992; 1: 133-140Google Scholar). Briefly, 80–100% confluent cell monolayers in 24-well plates (Costar, Cambridge MA) were incubated in binding buffer containing various concentrations of [3H]bradykinin in the absence (total binding) or presence of 100-fold excess of bradykinin (nonspecific binding) for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound radioactivity was removed by washing three times with binding buffer containing 0.15% bovine serum albumin. Cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Cell-bound radioactivity was determined in a β counter after the addition of 2 ml of Ecolite scintillation fluid. For internalization studies, cells were incubated with 100 nm bradykinin at different time point at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold buffer to remove unbound bradykinin. Surface bound ligand was stripped by a 5-min incubation on ice with 0.2m acetic acid, pH 3.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The number of binding sites was then determined by performing a binding assay as above. Data were expressed as the percentage of [3H]bradykinin-specific binding remaining after acid washing. All values are represented as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis of data. A diagrammatic representation of wild type bradykinin B2 receptor construct is illustrated in Fig. 1. Tyr-131 was mutated to the corresponding alanine, serine, and phenylalanine, designated Y131A, Y131S, and Y131F, respectively. Tyr-321 was mutated to alanine, designated Y321A. Carboxyl-terminal truncation mutant missing the terminal 34 amino acids is designated DC34. Although previous binding studies have shown some endogenous bradykinin B2 receptors in Rat-1 cells (11Roberts R.A. Gullick W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 527-535Google Scholar), our control Rat-1 cells did not express detectable levels of [3H]bradykinin binding or bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover and arachidonate release. Rat-1 cells were then stably transfected using an expression vector pRC/CMV, containing cDNA inserts encoding the full-length or the mutated rat bradykinin B2 receptors. Tritium-labeled ligand binding analysis was performed in intact Rat-1 cells, untransfected or stably transfected with wild type or mutant bradykinin B2 receptors to assess receptor expression. Fig. 2 illustrates saturation binding of untransfected cells, which did not bind bradykinin and wild type bradykinin B2 receptor-transfected cells, which bound bradykinin with a Kd of 2.24 nm. The binding properties of mutant receptors to bradykinin when expressed in Rat-1 cells are summarized in Table I. As seen in Table I, all mutant receptors bound with a dissociation constant similar to that for the wild type receptor. The Y131F mutant receptor showed a slight increase in binding affinity, whereas the Y321A receptor showed a binding affinity identical to that of the wild type receptor. For the purposes of this study we chose cell clones with aBmax ranging from 4.8 × 105 to 13 × 105 receptors/cell.Table IBinding parameters of [3H]bradykinin in transfected Rat-1 cellsReceptorKdBmaxnmsites/cellWild type2.2450,160 ± 4,917Y131A2.173101,240 ± 9,640Y131S1.84131,357 ± 5,613Y131F1.17103,056 ± 6,314Y321A2.32113,866 ± 9,108DC341.8947,772 ± 1,590Data represent the means ± S.E. obtained from three experiments with each point performed in duplicate.

To determine the consequence of the bradykinin B2 receptor mutation on receptor-phospholipase C interaction we measured total IP production in response to bradykinin by the variously transfected Rat-1 cells. We showed previously that bradykinin-stimulated IP production was not receptor number-dependent in cells possessing between 25,000 and 140,000 bradykinin B2 receptors/cell. 2D. A. Ricupero, P. Polgar, L. Taylor, M. O. Sowell, G. Yunling, G. Bradwin, and R. M. Mortensen, submitted for publication. Rat-1 cells transfected with Y321A bradykinin B2 receptor showed a 30% reduction in bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover compared with wild type transfected cells (Fig. 3). Truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 34 amino acids reduced IP production by 70%. Mutation of Tyr-131 to alanine or serine resulted in the most dramatic alterations in bradykinin-stimulated IP production. The response to bradykinin in the Y131A- and Y131S-transfected cells was reduced by 91 and 93%, respectively. However, bradykinin-caused IP accumulation in Y131F-transfected cells remained unchanged. Based on these results, it appears that Tyr-131 residue has an important role in the action of bradykinin on phosphoinositide turnover. We next determined the ability of the mutant receptors to regulate the release of free arachidonate from Rat-1 cells transfected with the various mutant cDNAs. In cells containing between 28 and 120 × 105 receptors bradykinin-caused release was not receptor number-dependent (data not shown). As shown in Fig.4, mutation of Tyr-131 proved important to this process. In cells transfected with Y131A, bradykinin lost 80% of its stimulating activity. The Y131S-transfected cells lost all response to bradykinin, and the Y131F-transfectants displayed a 50% loss in bradykinin response compared with the wild type. Bradykinin-stimulated release of arachidonate in Y321A receptor mutant and DC34-truncated receptor cells was also reduced by approximately 50%. To assess the contribution of Tyr-131, Tyr-321, and the carboxyl terminus to the regulation of receptor internalization, we analyzed the ability of bradykinin to induce loss of further bradykinin surface binding. Rat-1 cells expressing wild type or the mutant receptors were treated with excess ligand, 100 nm bradykinin, for 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min at 37 °C to promote receptor internalization. The receptor-associated bradykinin was then removed by an acid wash, and the number of remaining binding sites was determined by incubating the cells with a saturating concentration of [3H]bradykinin at 4 °C. As shown in Fig.5, all receptors exhibited a time-dependent decrease in [3H]bradykinin binding. In 15 min approximately 45% of wild type binding sites were removed. Truncation of amino acid residues between positions 332 and 366 led to a decrease in uptake compared with wild type, to only a 15% receptor uptake at 15 min and 30% at 30 min. On the other hand, mutation of Tyr-131 to Ser and Tyr-321 to Ala resulted in transfectants with very rapid receptor uptake of approximately 70% at 15 min. The corresponding Y131F transfectant showed only a small decrease in receptor uptake of approximately 35% at 15 min; the Y131A mutant displayed a larger decrease in uptake of approximately 20% at 15 min. To begin to identify the molecular determinants of the rat bradykinin B2 receptor-mediated intracellular signaling, we generated a truncated mutant of the receptor in which the last 34 amino acids of the carboxyl tail were deleted. This sequence contains four serine and two threonine residues and two protein kinase C consensus sequences. We also focused on the two intracellular Tyr residues that have been implicated in signal transduction leading to prostaglandin synthesis (12Jong Y.J. Dalemar L.R. Wilhelm B. Baenziger N.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10994-10998Google Scholar). Tyr-131, located in the second intracellular loop (i2) within the DRY motif, is within a region that is conserved among the family of G-protein coupled receptors (13Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 487-498Google Scholar). Tyr-321, located in the proximal carboxyl tail, is also conserved in all species of the bradykinin B1 and B2 receptor family. We analyzed the functional roles of these conserved residues, Tyr-131 and Tyr-321, in terms of their involvement in bradykinin-induced receptor internalization and signal transduction. Our findings indicate that both Tyr residues and the carboxyl terminus influence receptor internalization and signal transduction but do so in different ways. The exchange of Tyr-131 or Tyr-321 for alanine, Tyr-131 for serine or phenylalanine, or truncation of the last 34 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus did not impede the insertion of the receptor into the membrane or the binding affinity for the ligand. All mutant receptors, including the wild type, yielded clones with various number of receptors/cell (between 48,000 and 115,000). Within this receptor range, we found bradykinin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover and arachidonate release to be independent of receptor number. Tyr-131 appears focal for all three processes examined here, namely IP generation, arachidonate release, and receptor internalization. With regard to receptor interaction with phospholipase C, i.e. IP accumulation, the importance of Tyr-131 is evident with almost total loss of activity in both Y131A and Y131S mutant receptors. These two amino acids are considerably smaller than Tyr and do not contain the aromatic ring. Serine, however, possesses a hydroxyl group and can be phosphorylated and/or form hydrogen bonds (14Huang C. Tai H.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 161-166Google Scholar). Telling in this mechanism is the total retaining of activity in the Y131F-transfected cells. Since phenylalanine does not possess a hydroxyl group, Tyr phosphorylation or the charge contribution of the hydroxyl group does not appear critical. Instead, the hexane ring itself or the amino acid bulk may be a determinant of the specificity of this site. This finding agrees with a previous report that shows that Tyr residues of the bradykinin B2 receptor are not phosphorylated as indicated by phosphoamino acid analysis.(15). Tyr-131 is also critical for bradykinin-activated arachidonate release. This is indicated by an 80% reduction in response in Y131A and a total loss of response in Y131S. The difference in response between Y131S and Y131A is probably due to the large receptor uptake of the Y131S. In addition, the Y131F mutant does not revert completely to the wild type response. Instead, it displays a small but statistically significant loss in response compared with wild type. It is possible that in this case charge or the aromatic acid bulk plays a cooperative role in this activity. The role of Tyr-131 in receptor internalization is more difficult to assess. Replacement of Tyr with either phenylalanine or alanine limits uptake of the bradykinin B2 receptor as indicated by the reduced receptor uptake in Y131A and Y131F. In this regard, the bulk of the amino acid at this position appears to have a stabilizing effect with the smaller alanine moiety being more restrictive to uptake than the large phenylalanine and underscores the role for a hydrophilic amino acid. Indeed, our results show that replacement of a hydrophilic Tyr by a smaller hydrophilic amino acid such as Ser promotes rapid receptor internalization. Serine residues have been linked to receptor internalization from mutagenesis studies of other G-protein-coupled receptors such as muscarinic receptors, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 receptor, and β2-adrenergic receptor (16Lameh J. Philip M. Sharma Y.K. Moro O. Ramachandran J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13406-13412Google Scholar, 17Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Google Scholar, 18Franci C.

Ostrowski J. Yu S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2979-2983Google Scholar). In addition to the likely conformational changes, it is possible that insertion of serine at position 131 within the conserved DRY motif of the receptor, permits phosphorylation of this site by a Ser/Thr kinase, which then facilitates receptor uptake. As shown in a reported phosphoamino acid analysis of the bradykinin B2 receptor, serine residues are the prime targets for bradykinin-induced phosphorylation, whereas tyrosine moieties are not (15Blaukat A. Alla S.A. Lohse M.J. Müller-Esterl W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Google Scholar). Interestingly, the highly conserved DRY region has been linked to the internalization of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (21Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Google Scholar). The Tyr in the DRY region of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor is normally replaced by Ser. When this Ser is mutated to Tyr, a 60% increase in uptake takes place (21Arora K.K. Sakai A. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22820-22826Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of Tyr-131 within the highly conserved DRY region may be part of a motif that acts as a determinant of bradykinin B2 receptor uptake. Truncation of the carboxyl terminus has been shown repeatedly, in a number of different receptor cDNAs, to influence receptor internalization (22Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Google Scholar, 23Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22153-22159Google Scholar, 24Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Google Scholar). Our results show that the carboxyl tail of the bradykinin B2 receptor is critical for regulation of receptor internalization. Truncation of the terminal 34 amino acids leads to a slower rate of receptor uptake. It is interesting to note that receptor uptake in the truncated mutant becomes indistinguishable from the wild type receptor at 60 min. This suggests that other sites in the carboxyl terminus may also be involved in receptor internalization regulation. We then focused on a conserved Tyr residue in the proximal region of the carboxyl terminus of the bradykinin B2 receptor. The exchange of Tyr-321, at the proximal region of the carboxyl tail, to alanine led to a dramatic increase in receptor uptake. At 60 min 40% more Tyr-321 receptor is taken up compared to wild type. Thus the presence of Tyr at position 321 which is part of the carboxyl terminus inhibits receptor internalization. The same mutation leads to only a small inhibition of bradykinin-activated IP accumulation or arachidonate release. This inhibition is probably a manifestation of the dramatic uptake of this receptor during the initial 10 min following ligand-receptor interaction. These observations on the effect of Y321A mutation on receptor internalization emphasize the importance of aromatic amino acids in maintaining efficient endocytosis. It is possible that Tyr-321 may be part of a recognition feature involving a limited number of residues. Endocytotic motifs containing tyrosines in the carboxyl tail have been identified in many single transmembrane domain proteins (24Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Google Scholar). Internalization motifs have been proposed to contain six residues involving a type I-β turn with an exposed aromatic (Tyr) residue (23Thomas W.G. Baker K.M. Motel T.J. Thekkumkara T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22153-22159Google Scholar). In addition to such motifs, the overall topological and conformational structure of the carboxyl terminus appears to play an important role in receptor internalization. In conclusion, we analyzed the functional significance of two residues, a conserved Tyr-131 and a unique Tyr-321, and the carboxyl terminus of the rat bradykinin B2 receptor. The conserved Tyr-131 appears to play a significant role in receptor G-protein coupling (i.e.stimulation of IP production and arachidonate release) and influences internalization of the receptor. In contrast, Tyr-321 is not required for G-protein coupling but is involved in agonist-induced internalization of the receptor. The carboxyl terminus containing the putative phosphorylation sites Ser/Thr residues also appears to play a significant role in receptor internalization."

Localization of the cytokine response element by 5′-deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a cis-acting binding site for activated STAT complexes. Furthermore, DNA binding analysis demonstrated that this element binds activated STAT1 and STAT3 homo- and heterodimers. This STAT-binding element was sufficient to confer cytokine stimulation to a minimal herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter.

Ligand binding to the specificity determining subunit of these receptors (α subunits) causes tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 (β subunit) by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases (6Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Google Scholar). This event results in tyrosine phosphorylation of several downstream signaling molecules including members of the STAT family of transcription factors (7Boulton T.G. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J.

Phosphorylated STATs in turn undergo homo- and heterodimerization and translocate to the nucleus where they activate transcription of cytokine responsive genes (9Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M.

In mammals, the STAT family includes at least six members which are differentially activated by a variety of growth factors and cytokines (10Ihle J.N. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar). Ligand-activated gp130-JAK complexes predominantly phosphorylate STAT3 (also known as acute-phase response factor or APRF) and to a lesser extent STAT1 (11Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C.

The cis-acting DNA sequences recognized by STAT complexes, termed STAT-binding elements (SBEs) have the general structure TT(N)5AA (9Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

The sequence, and in some cases the size, of the spacer region between the palindromic TT-AA motif confers specificity for different STATs (11Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C.

An alternative sequence (CTGGGA), originally termed acute-phase response element (APRE), is required for IL-6 induction of many acute-phase response genes (3Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Google Scholar) and is found in the spacer region of some palindromic SBEs or in incomplete palindromic forms which may also bind STATs (11Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J.

Intrigued by the evidence that IL-6 increases gp130 mRNA in vitro in human monocytes, epithelial cells, or hepatoma cells (16Schoester M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L.

Kishimoto T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 4066-4071Google Scholar); and that several systemic hormones regulate gp130 expression (20Ogata A. Nishimoto N. Shima Y. Yoshizaki K. Kishimoto T.

Res. 1994; 9 (abstr.): S123Google Scholar), we have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human gp130 gene. Using chimeric gp130 promoter/luciferase reporter constructs, we demonstrate that this region functions as a constitutively active transcriptional promoter and that its activity is stimulated by IL-6-type cytokines. In addition, we have localized a cis-acting sequence element responsible for induction by these cytokines and show that it conforms to the consensus binding site for activated STAT complexes. The STAT complexes which bind the gp130 cytokine response element are identified as STAT1 and STAT3 homo and heterodimers. Finally, we show that this SBE is sufficient to confer cytokine inducibility on a heterologous promoter to a level comparable to previously characterized SBEs. A human fibroblast genomic library in the Lambda FIX II vector (Stratagene) was screened with a probe consisting of the 5′-terminal 550 bp of the human gp130 cDNA (4Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Google Scholar) according to established methods (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar). DNA was purified from positive plaques and mapped by partial restriction enzyme digestion combined with Southern blot analysis (24Southern E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Google Scholar). A 2.7-kb EcoRI fragment which hybridized to the probe was isolated from a clone containing a 12.5-kb insert and was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) to yield the plasmid pAE3. Both strands of the 2.7-kb fragment were completely sequenced by the chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using sequence-derived primers (GenBank accession number U70617). Primer extension was performed using an oligonucleotide primer complementary to bases +116 to +136 of the first exon shown in Fig. 1 B. The 5′-32P-labeled primer was annealed to 20 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the ARD cell line in 1 × first strand buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mmKCl, 3 mm MgCl2) for 1 h at 60 °C and then placed on ice. Dithiothreitol and deoxynucleoside triphosphates were added to a final concentration of 10 and 500 mm, respectively, followed by 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was incubated at 45 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of ribonuclease A to a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml and a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then precipitated with ethanol, resuspended in 95% formamide, heat denatured, and fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. The S1 nuclease assay was performed using a 32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA probe (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) generated by extension of the 116–136 oligonucleotide, described above, after it was annealed to single-stranded DNA from the pAE3 plasmid. The probe was annealed to 50 μg of total RNA from HepG2, ARD, or Escherichia coli cells in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mm 1,4-PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 80% formamide) overnight at 30 °C. S1 nuclease digestion was carried out by the addition of 300 μl of S1 mapping buffer (280 mmNaCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 4.5 mmZnCl2, 20 μg/ml single-stranded DNA, and 1000 units/ml S1 nuclease) and incubation at 42 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated with 80 μl of stop buffer (4 m ammonium acetate, 50 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml E. colitRNA) and the products were ethanol precipitated and fractionated as described for the primer extension products. HepG2 hepatoma cells and HeLa epithelial carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in phenol red-free minimum essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma). A human myeloma cell line (ARD) was kindly provided by Dr. Bart Barlogie (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences) and was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. A murine preadipocyte cell line, +/+LDA.11, was cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cytokines were obtained from R & D Systems and were used at the following final concentrations: IL-6, 20 ng/ml; OSM, 20 ng/ml; IL-6sR, 40 ng/ml; IFN-γ, 5 ng/ml. Transient transfections of all cell types were carried out in 12-well tissue culture plates (2.2-cm diameter wells) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the day before transfection, cells were seeded at 2–4 × 104cells/well in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day, the cells were washed once with serum-free medium and each well was incubated with serum-free medium containing 200 ng of chimeric luciferase reporter plasmid, 200 ng of control plasmid (pSVbetagalactosidase Vector, Promega), and LipofectAMINE for 5 h. The medium was replaced with serum-containing medium and the cells were allowed to recover for 24 h before treatment with cytokines or hormones. The only exception was the experiment described in Fig. 3 in which the cells were cultured for 48 h following transfection. Lysate preparation and luciferase activity assays were performed using a kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Light intensity was measured with a Turner luminometer. The colorometric β-galactosidase assay was performed using standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1989; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) and luciferase activity was divided by the β-galactosidase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. All of the chimeric luciferase reporter constructs in this study were prepared using the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). A region spanning −2433 to +64 of gp130 5′-flanking region was prepared by partial digestion of the 2.7-kb EcoRI fragment of pAE3 with PvuII and purification of the 2.5-kb fragment. The 2.5-kb fragment was blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow) and ligated into theSmaI site of pGL3-Basic to produce constructs with the insert in either the sense (p-2433) or antisense (p-2433-AS) orientation. Each of the 5′-deletion constructs was prepared from p-2433 utilizing existing restriction enzyme sites (indicated in Fig.5 A). Constructs in which the APRE sequence (mt1) or the SBE sequence (mt2) were eliminated from the p-381 5′-deletion construct were prepared using the Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter/luciferase construct (ptk-LUC) was prepared by insertion of theBamHI/BglII fragment of pBLCAT2 (26Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar), which spans positions −105 to +51 of the thymidine kinase gene, into theBglII site of pGL3-Basic. The heterologous constructs depicted in Fig. 7 were prepared by insertion of the following double-stranded oligonucleotides (only the top strands are shown) into the SmaI site of ptk-LUC: gp130, GATCGCGTTACGGGAATCG; SIE, GATCGATTGACGGGAACT; rat α2-macroglobulin, GATCCTTCTGGGAATTC. Plasmids with single or double insertions were identified by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by sequencing.Figure 7The gp130 SBE confers cytokine inducibility to a heterologous promoter. SBEs from the gp130, c-fos, or rat α2-macroglobulin promoters were inserted upstream from the herpesvirus thymidine kinase (tk) promoter driving the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. Reporters were constructed with either 1 or 2 copies of the SBE placed upstream of the tk promoter. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with these constructs and treated with IL-6, OSM, or IFN-γ for 5 h. The value shown is the mean fold induction (induced/uninduced) calculated from two different experiments in which the value for induced and uninduced were the means of three independent transfections. Theerror bars indicate the standard error of the mean from two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells using the method described by Sadowski and Gilman (27Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Google Scholar). Cells grown to approximately 70% confluence in 10-cm dishes were treated with cytokines for 15 min. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The cells on each plate were lysed with 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (hypotonic buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40), scraped into microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed for 5 s, and centrifuged for 30 s at 15,000 × g. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.2 ml of high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer with NaCl and glycerol added to 420 mmand 20%, respectively) and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional mixing. Nuclear debris were pelleted at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were quick-frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 °C. Probes for the DNA mobility shift assay were prepared by filling in GATC overhangs of double-stranded oligonucleotides (described in the DNA construction section) using Klenow and [α-32P]dCTP. DNA binding reactions were performed by preincubating 15 μg of nuclear extract with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) in 1 × binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of approximately 5 fmol of probe (20,000 cpm) and an additional 15-min incubation at room temperature. The reactions were resolved on 5% polyacrylamide gels (39:1 acrylamide:bis) containing 1% glycerol in 0.5 × TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) buffer. For supershift assays, binding reactions were preincubated with either anti-STAT1 or anti-STAT3 antibodies (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or non-immune rabbit IgG for 15 min at room temperature. A human fibroblast genomic DNA library was screened with a probe consisting of the extreme 5′-end of the cloned human gp130 cDNA (4Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Google Scholar). Several clones were isolated and the hybridizing region from each was subcloned and partially sequenced. One of the clones contained a region which was identical to the first 152 bp of the reported gp130 cDNA sequence (Fig. 1, A and B). This clone was selected for further analysis and a partial restriction enzyme map of the 12.5-kb insert is shown in Fig. 1 A. One of the remaining clones possessed approximately 3 kb of continuous homology to the gp130 cDNA but contained several mismatches, small insertions and deletions (not shown). Since the homologous region in this clone was uninterrupted by introns, it was concluded that this fragment represented a processed gp130 pseudogene. This conclusion is consistent with the previous observation that two distinct loci, one each on chromosomes 5 and 17, hybridized to gp130 probes (28Kidd V.J. Nesbitt J.E. Fuller G.M. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 477-483Google Scholar) and that a pseudogene-like sequence was polymerase chain reaction amplified from chromosome 17 DNA (29Rodriguez C. Grosgeorge J. Nguyen V.C. Gaudray P. Theillet C. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1995; 70: 64-67Google Scholar). A 2.7-kb EcoRI fragment containing the 152-bp identity with the gp130 cDNA was subcloned and completely sequenced. To identify the transcription start sites, primer extension analysis was performed using a primer complementary to bases 116– 136 of the exon 1 sequence (from Fig. 1 B) and poly(A)+ RNA from ARD cells. ARD cells were chosen for these experiments because they produce relatively large amounts of gp130 mRNA compared with other cell lines examined (not shown). The primer extension products indicated that there are three groups of start sites, designated A, B, and C, which begin 17 bp upstream from the 5′-end of the known cDNA sequence (Fig. 2, left panel). S1 nuclease protection assays performed on total RNA from HepG2 and ARD cells revealed protected fragments corresponding to the same three sets of start sites as the primer extension analysis ( Fig. 2, right panel). Sequence analysis of the region upstream of the transcription start sites revealed a G + C-rich region that did not contain a TATA box (Fig. 1 B). However, a potential Sp1-binding site was present at −47 bp and two CCAAT motifs were located at −135 and −167 bp. Besides several additional Sp1 sites, the first 600 bp of 5′-flanking region also contained several sequences homologous to IL-6 type cytokine response elements including a palindromic SBE (TTACGGGAA), a non-palindromic SBE or APRE (CTGGGA), and two adjacent NFIL6/C-EBPβ-binding sites (3Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Google Scholar, 30Lasfar A. Wietzerbin J. Billard C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 124-130Google Scholar). To confirm that the isolated DNA fragment contained a functional promoter, we prepared reporter gene constructs by inserting the 5′-flanking region (spanning bases −2433 to +64 relative to the most 3′-transcription start site) upstream from the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3-Basic vector. When a construct with this fragment in the sense orientation (p-2433) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, a significant level of transcriptional activity was observed (Fig. 3). The parental vector or the parental vector containing the fragment in the antisense orientation produced only trace amounts of transcriptional activity. Similar results were obtained when this set of constructs was transfected into HeLa or +/+LDA.11 cells (not shown). These results establish that the 5′-flanking region of gp130 contains a promoter that is constituitively active in epithelial and fibroblastoid cell types. Transcriptional regulation of the gp130 promoter was subsequently investigated in HepG2 cells transiently transfected with the p-2433 construct. Consistent with earlier evidence suggesting that gp130 production is regulated, 5-h treatment with IL-6 in combination with the IL-6-soluble receptor (IL-6sR) or OSM stimulated the activity of the promoter approximately 4-fold, while IL-6 alone produced approximately a 2-fold increase (Fig. 4). Essentially the same results were obtained when the treatment time was extended to 24 h, with the only exception that the effects of IL-6 + IL-6sR and OSM were slightly lower and that for IL-6 was higher compared with the 5-h time point. In line with the evidence that interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-6 activate overlapping sets of transcription factors and genes (31Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Google Scholar), 5-h treatment with IFN-γ stimulated the reporter construct to a level similar to that produced by IL-6. However, after 24 h of treatment, the response to IFN-γ was significantly decreased. To identify the cis-acting sequence elements responsible for the induction of the gp130 promoter by IL-6 type cytokines, sequential 5′-deletion constructs of the plasmid p-2433 were prepared (depicted in Fig. 5 A). Transfection of these constructs into HepG2 cells and treatment with either IL-6 or OSM for 5 h revealed that deletion beyond −191 bp abolished the response to either cytokine (Fig. 5 A). Besides failing to exhibit cytokine responsiveness, the −191 construct also displayed a significant decrease in basal transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the region between −381 and −191 bp contained sequences responsible for the majority of the cytokine responsiveness as well as sequences contributing to the basal transcriptional activity of the gp130 promoter. The region between −381 and −191 bp contains two potential cytokine response elements identified by comparison to consensus sequences: a palindromic SBE (TTACGGGAA) and a non-palindromic SBE or APRE (CTGGGA). Based on this and evidence that IL-6-type cytokines utilize STAT proteins in their signal transduction pathway, we reasoned that one or both of these potential SBEs might be responsible for the cytokine induction of the gp130 promoter. To address this issue, we prepared reporter constructs in which either of these potential response elements were eliminated from the −381 promoter fragment by site-directed mutagenesis. The constructs were then transiently transfected into HepG2 cells and their activity was examined following 5 h of treatment with IL-6 or OSM. The wild-type −381 promoter fragment responded to IL-6 and OSM as expected from the 5′-deletion analysis and this response was unaffected in the construct containing the mutated APRE consensus sequence (mt1) (Fig. 5 B). However, the construct containing the mutated palindromic SBE consensus sequence was unresponsive to either cytokine (mt2 in Fig.5 B). Thus, the SBE-like sequence located between −381 and −191 bp is required for stimulation of the gp130 promoter by IL-6 and OSM. The sequence between the TT-AA motif of the gp130 cytokine response element is identical to the IL-6-response element from the human α2-macroglobulin promoter (32Krause E. Wegenka U. Moller C. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 509-515Google Scholar) and to the c-fos SBE known as thesis-inducible element (SIE) (33Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Google Scholar). The SIE binds STAT1 and STAT3 homo- and heterodimers (12Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Google Scholar, 34Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Google Scholar) and is required in vivo for the induction of the c-fos gene by a variety of stimuli (35Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Google Scholar). A comparison of the gp130 SBE-like sequence with SBEs from various cytokine or growth factor-inducible promoters is shown in Table I. Both a mutant version of the SIE, denoted SIEm67, and a SBE from the rat α2-macroglobulin promoter, which contains the APRE consensus (CTGGGA), have been used as classical IL-6 response elements (12Zhong Z.

https://openalex.org/W2077453307,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors constitute a multigene family (α2–α9, β2–β4) expressed in discrete temporal and spatial patterns within the nervous system. The receptors are critical for proper signal transmission between neurons and their targets. The molecular mechanisms underlying receptor gene expression have not been completely elucidated but clearly involve regulation at the level of transcription. We previously identified a novel 19-base pair (bp) transcriptional regulatory element in the promoter region of the rat β4 subunit gene. This 19-bp element interacts specifically with DNA-binding proteins enriched in nuclear extracts prepared from adult rat brain. Using a combination of cellulose-phosphate, DNA-cellulose, and DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatographies, we purified the 19-bp element binding activity approximately 19,000-fold. Analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of four polypeptides in the most purified fraction, ranging in molecular masses between 31 and 114 kDa. Peptide sequence analysis revealed that one of the polypeptides is the bovine homologue of the transcriptional regulatory factor, Purα. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that Purα interacts directly and specifically with the 19-bp element. In addition, mobility shift assays using an anti-Purα monoclonal antibody revealed the presence of Purα, or an immunologically related protein, in nuclear extracts prepared from brain tissue. We hypothesize that the interaction between Purα and the 19-bp element is critical for proper expression of the β4 subunit gene.

One of the key events that takes place during development of the nervous system is the formation of synapses. Numerous lines of evidence indicate that expression of neurotransmitter sensitivity is central to synaptogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 1Role L.W. Berg D.K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1077-1085Google Scholar). It is also clear that changes in sensitivity to neurotransmitters are due to changes in the expression of neurotransmitter receptors. Recent advances toward a molecular understanding of the formation of nicotinic cholinergic synapses in the nervous system were made with the isolation of a family of genes (α2–α9 and β2–β4) encoding subunits of the nicotinic receptors for acetylcholine (nACh 1The abbreviations used are:nAChnicotinic acetylcholineNARPneuronal nACh receptor promoter-binding proteinbpbase pair(s)EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGSTglutathione S-transferaseDTTdithiothreitolPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. reviewed in Ref. 2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Google Scholar). Functionally diverse nACh receptors can be generated by distinct combinations of the subunits in vitro(3Papke R.L. Boulter J. Patrick J.

In addition, each of the subunits exhibits discrete temporally and spatially restricted expression patterns in vivo (2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Google Scholar). Despite these important advances, however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of the nACh receptor genes are relatively obscure, although several recent studies suggest that both positive and negative transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are involved in receptor gene expression (6Bessis A.

Three of the nACh receptor genes, those encoding the β4, α3, and α5 subunits, are tightly linked within the rat genome, spanning only approximately 60 kilobase pairs (17Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D. Ballivet M. Deneris E.S. McKinnon D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4472-4482Google Scholar). This genomic organization, coupled with the high nucleotide sequence similarities between the three genes, suggests that the genes arose through tandem duplication of a common ancestral gene as has been suggested previously (17Boulter J. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Duvoisin R.M. Connolly J.G. Wada E. Jensen A. Gardner P.D. Ballivet M. Deneris E.S. McKinnon D. Heinemann S. Patrick J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4472-4482Google Scholar). On the other hand, the genomic organization may also reflect a regulatory mechanism that ensures co-expression of the genes in the appropriate cell types at the appropriate developmental time. Such a mechanism would be consistent with recent data indicating the presence, in vivo, of receptors consisting of β4, α3, and α5 subunits (18Conroy W.G. Berg D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4424-4431Google Scholar). However, the expression of these genes is not completely overlapping (2Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Google Scholar) and, thus, some other mechanism must account for this disparity. One possibility is that while each of the subunit genes is independently regulated transcriptionally, they share some common regulatory features, which are active in the appropriate developmental and cellular environments. Several laboratories, including ours, have characterized distinct promoter regions for the β4 (10Hu M. Whiting Theobald N.L. Gardner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 302-395Google Scholar, 11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Google Scholar, 14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar) and α3 (9Yang X. Fyodorov D. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Google Scholar, 15Boyd R.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 960-973Google Scholar, 16Fyodorov D. Deneris E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5004-5014Google Scholar) subunit genes. Within these regions, several transcriptional regulatory elements have been identified. Thus far, the only regulatory element common to both the β4 and α3 genes is a consensus Sp1-binding site, which appears critical for transcription of the two genes (9Yang X. Fyodorov D. Deneris E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8514-8520Google Scholar, 14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). Our analysis of the rat β4 subunit promoter region led to the identification of three elements, E1–E3, which may play roles in β4 gene expression (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). E2 is the aforementioned Sp1-binding site, E3 shares some sequence homology with the consensus AP1-binding site, and E1 is a novel 19-bp regulatory element (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). E1, characterized by three CCCT repeats, forms specific complexes with proteins present in nuclear extracts prepared from neuronal cells (11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Google Scholar,14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). We have now used E1 as an affinity ligand in a purification scheme to isolate, from bovine brain nuclear extracts, the nuclear proteins which bind specifically to this element. In the most highly purified fraction, four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 31, 43, 65, and 114 kDa were detected. We termed these E1-binding proteins,neuronal nACh receptorpromoter-binding proteins (NARP31, -43, -65, and -114). Peptide sequence analysis indicated that NARP43 is the bovine homologue of Purα, a DNA-binding protein previously shown to stimulate transcription of the myelin basic protein gene in oligodendrocytic cells (19Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) demonstrated that Purα is present in nuclear extracts prepared from brain and binds directly and specifically to E1, raising the possibility that this interaction plays a role in the expression of the β4 subunit gene. Buffer C consisted of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmDTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20% glycerol. Buffer D consisted of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Buffer E consisted of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol. Binding buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 50–100 mm KCl, and 6% glycerol. Buffer Z consisted of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The sequence of E1 used as a probe and competitor in EMSA is shown in Fig. 1 along with the sequence of a mutated form of the element used as a competitor in EMSA. The E1 complementary oligonucleotides (from Cruachem, Inc.) were annealed and then radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The specific activities of the probes were typically between 14,000 and 17,000 cpm/fmol. Competitor oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing equal amounts of non-radioactive complementary oligonucleotides. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Christy et al. (20Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Google Scholar). Bovine brains were obtained within 1 h of death from a local slaughterhouse (Kiolbassa Provision Company), while fresh rat brains were from adult female Harlan Sprague Dawley animals (Charles River Laboratories). The final rat brain nuclear extract pellet was resuspended in buffer C, while the final bovine brain nuclear extract pellet was resuspended in buffer D in preparation for phosphocellulose chromatography (see below). The nuclear extracts were dialyzed overnight in the buffer in which they were resuspended. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. During phosphocellulose and DNA-cellulose chromatography, protein was monitored by measuring absorbances at 280 nm. Protein concentrations were determined by using bicinchoninic acid (Pierce). E1 binding activity was detected using EMSA as described previously (11Hu M. Bigger C.B. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4497-4502Google Scholar). To demonstrate sequence specificity of the DNA-protein complexes, competition experiments were done with a 15-min preincubation of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. The amount of DNA present in specific DNA-protein complexes was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Imagequant software. Antibody supershift experiments were performed by incubating 1 μg of a monoclonal antibody directed against Purα (9C12, Ref. 24Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Google Scholar) or a nonrelated preimmune serum with 0.5 μg of bovine brain nuclear extract for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition of specific probe. Following a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis through 6% native acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Crude nuclear extract from bovine brain (365 mg) was applied directly onto a 1.6 × 50-cm P11 phosphocellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl. After washing with three column volumes of the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of NaCl from 50 mm to 800 mm in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Approximately 9-ml fractions were collected and assayed for E1 binding activity using EMSA as described above. Fractions with binding activity (11 mg) were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against buffer E, and then loaded onto a native calf thymus DNA-cellulose column (10 ml), which was equilibrated with buffer E. After washing with three column volumes of the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of NaCl from 50 mm to 1.0 m in buffer E. Fractions containing E1 binding activity (2.5 mg) were pooled, and dialyzed against buffer Z in preparation for DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatography. Preparation and regeneration of the E1 affinity column was done essentially as described by Kadonaga and Tjian (21Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Google Scholar). Two 23-base complementary oligonucleotides containing the E1 sequence (see Fig. 1) were synthesized and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complementary 4-base overhangs (5′-GATC-3′) were added to the E1 sequences to increase the efficiency of concatenation. The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated, concatenated, and subsequently coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Dialyzed, pooled fractions from the DNA-cellulose column were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 2 mg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)-protein mixture was applied to the affinity column equilibrated with buffer Z containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with buffer Z containing 0.1 m KCl, followed by elution of E1 binding activity using a linear gradient of KCl from 0.2 m to 1.0 m(in buffer Z). Fractions containing E1 binding activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer Z containing 0.1 m KCl, reabsorbed to the regenerated affinity resin, and eluted as described above. Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and stained with silver (Bio-Rad). Polypeptides were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in buffer containing 12.5 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 96 mm glycine and 10% methanol. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Amido Black in 10% acetic acid. After destaining, NARP43 was excised, washed with HPLC-grade H2O, dried, and subjected to amino acid microsequencing (Harvard Microsequencing Facility) as described previously (23Lane W.S. Galat A. Harding M.W. Schreiber S.L. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 151-160Google Scholar). A glutathione S-transferase-Purα fusion construct, GST-PUR-(1–322), was generously provided by Drs. Phang-Lang Chen and Wen-Hwa Lee (University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio) (24Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Google Scholar). Expression and purification of GST and the GST-Purα fusion proteins was carried out as described (24Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Google Scholar). The GST moiety was removed from the GST-Purα fusion protein (0.5 mg) by cleavage with thrombin (1,500 units). The GST moiety was removed from the reaction mixture by the addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads followed by centrifugation. Sample stability, the efficiency of thrombin cleavage, and the purity of the released Purα were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We previously identified several transcriptional regulatory elements, E1–E3 (Fig. 1), in the rat β4 subunit gene (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). One of these elements, E2, is a binding site for the regulatory factors, Sp1 and Sp3 (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar),2while the identities of the proteins interacting with E1 and E3 are unknown. The study described below focuses upon E1 and the proteins with which it interacts. Our earlier analyses of the β4 subunit gene focused upon the rat gene. As there are advantages for using bovine brain versus rodent brain as a source of nuclear extract, we determined whether nuclear extracts from both species yielded similar electrophoretic mobility shift patterns when incubated with E1. As shown in Fig. 2, this is indeed the case. Incubation of radioactively labeled E1 with brain nuclear extracts prepared from both species resulted in the formation of three prominent DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 2). Competition experiments using either unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the β4 E1 sequence or to the binding sites for the general transcription factors Sp1, TFIID, or AP1 indicated that only the unlabeled β4 oligonucleotide was capable of interfering with radioactive DNA-protein complex formation. Similar results have been obtained from several independent preparations of nuclear extracts from each species (data not shown). These results indicated that bovine brain is a suitable source of nuclear extracts from which to purify the DNA-binding factors that interact with E1. We describe below experiments resulting in a highly purified preparation of complex A. Purification of the binding activity was achieved by a combination of phosphocellulose, DNA-cellulose, and DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatographies. The E1 binding activity bound to the P-11 phosphocellulose column and eluted from the column as a broad peak between 425 and 680 mm NaCl (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, a DNA-protein complex with higher electrophoretic mobility that was detected in the nuclear extract did not bind to the column (Fig.3 A). Competition experiments indicated that this faster migrating species was not DNA sequence-specific (data not shown). The origin of this nonspecific DNA-protein complex is unknown, although it is clearly not complexes B or C as they are sequence-specific and bind to the column (Fig. 3 A,fraction 43). In addition, the faster migrating species was not present in all nuclear extract preparations (data not shown). An approximately 6-fold purification of the specific E1 binding activity was achieved on the phosphocellulose column. The E1 binding activity was fractionated further by native DNA-cellulose chromatography. The binding activity eluted from the column as a sharp peak between 600 and 750 mm NaCl (Fig.3 B), indicating that the protein responsible for E1 binding also binds to DNA in a sequence-independent manner. DNA-cellulose chromatography afforded an approximately 3-fold greater purification of the E1 binding activity. The final chromatographic step was recognition site affinity chromatography on a column with covalently linked, catenated E1 oligonucleotides. The E1 binding activity bound to the affinity column and eluted at 350–500 mm KCl (Fig. 3 C). Two passages of the E1 binding activity over the affinity column resulted in approximately 960-fold purification with a 40% yield in this step. A summary of the purification data is presented in TableI and indicates that, relative to the nuclear extract, the final purification was approximately 19,000-fold with a 5% recovery of activity.Table IPurification of E1-binding proteinsTotal protein1-aProtein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (from Pierce) with BSA as a standard.Total activitySpecific activity1-bOne unit of E1 binding activity corresponds to the amount of protein that will bind one fmol of 32P-labeled E1 probe in a standard EMSA.

Open table in a new tab Analysis of the protein content of the E1 binding activity by silver staining after SDS-PAGE revealed four major polypeptides with molecular masses of 31, 43, 65, and 114 kDa (Fig. 3 D). We refer to these proteins as neuronal nACh receptor promoter-binding proteins, or NARP (i.e. NARP31, NARP43, etc.; Ref. 14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). In several preparations of the E1 binding activity, NARP43 was the most abundant species; therefore, it was the first NARP to be subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Following electrophoresis, NARP43 was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and digested with trypsin. The cleavage products were separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and four peptides were sequenced. The four amino acid sequences of these peptides were identical to sequences in the previously described Purα sequence (Fig. 4; Ref. 25Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.-W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Google Scholar). Purα is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that has recently been implicated in cell type-specific transcriptional regulation of myelin basic protein in oligodendrocytes (19Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Google Scholar). Its recognition element is purine-rich (25Bergemann A.D. Ma Z.-W. Johnson E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5673-5682Google Scholar), as is the sequence of E1 (Fig. 1). To determine whether Purα does in fact interact with E1, EMSA were carried out with a GST-Purα fusion protein (24Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, GST-Purα forms two major complexes with the radiolabeled E1 oligonucleotide, the larger of which is specific in that it can be competed away by an excess of unlabeled wild type E1 oligonucleotide but not by an excess of a mutant E1 oligonucleotide (see Fig. 1 for the sequences). GST alone does not form any specific complexes with E1 (Fig. 5). To confirm that Purα interacts specifically with E1, the GST moiety was cleaved from the GST-Purα fusion protein, the GST moiety was removed by thrombin cleavage (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the recovered Purα protein was used in EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5, purified Purα interacts specifically with E1 forming one major complex that can be competed by an excess of wild type E1 oligonucleotide but not by mutant E1 oligonucleotide. The results presented thus far strongly implicate Purα as playing a role in regulating the expression of the β4 subunit gene via interactions with E1. To determine whether Purα (or an immunologically related protein) is present in a more physiological context, we carried out supershift EMSA using a monoclonal antibody against Purα and crude nuclear extracts prepared from bovine brains. The extracts were incubated with one of three radiolabeled E1 probes (the coding strand, the noncoding strand, or double-stranded E1) and an anti-Purα monoclonal antibody (24Johnson E.M. Chen P.-L. Krachmarov C.P. Barr S.M. Kanovsky M. Ma Z. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24352-24360Google Scholar) prior to electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both single- and double-stranded probes were used to gain more insight into the interactions between Purα and E1; Purα has been shown to bind to both single- and double-stranded DNA targets (19Haas S. Thatikunta P. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1171-1179Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of the coding strand probe (ss c) with nuclear extract led to the appearance of a single DNA-protein complex (lower arrow). The mobility of this complex was unaltered by the addition of anti-Purα antibody or a preimmune serum. Similarly, incubation of the noncoding strand probe (ss nc) or the double-stranded probe (ds) with nuclear extract led to the appearance of one major DNA-protein complex (Fig. 6, upper arrow). These complexes migrated more slowly than that seen with the coding strand probe raising the possibility that different proteins can interact with the two strands. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that the addition of anti-Purα antibody led to a slight decrease in the mobilities of the complexes formed with the noncoding and double-stranded probes (Fig. 6, arrowhead). Although the decrease seen following addition of anti-Purα antibody was not as large as might be expected given the size of the antibody, it may be a consequence of the overall electrostatic charge of the DNA-Purα-anti-Purα antibody complex, such that the binding of antibody may not greatly change the overall charge of the DNA-protein complex. Given that separation through native acrylamide gels is based on charge rather than size, the small change in overall charge upon binding of antibody may not result in a large decrease in mobility. Nonetheless, these data suggest the presence of Purα, or an antigenically related protein, in bovine brain and further suggest that different proteins are capable of interacting with the coding and noncoding strands. It is also possible that the proteins which interact with the coding strand also interact with the noncoding strand and double-stranded DNA but in conjunction with Purα, resulting in a slower migrating DNA-protein complex. Alternatively, different proteins may interact with the two strands and the affinity of the protein for the noncoding strand is higher than the affinity of the protein for the coding strand such that when the double-stranded probe is used, it forms a complex with the noncoding-strand-binding-protein. Further analyses should help resolve these questions. In summary, we used a combination of phosphocellulose, DNA-cellulose, and DNA sequence-specific affinity chromatographies to purify the E1 binding activity approximately 19,000-fold from bovine brains. There are four major polypeptides in the most purified fraction. One of the proteins has been identified as the bovine homologue of the transcriptional regulatory factor, Purα. The identities of the other three proteins remain unknown but are the focus of current efforts. In addition, the functional role Purα plays in β4 subunit gene expression is under investigation. In this regard, it is interesting to note that Purα has been shown to interact with the retinoblastoma protein, an important regulatory factor known to be involved in cell cycle regulation and the expression of specific genes required for cellular differentiation (26Lee E.Y.-H.P. Hu N. Yuan F. Bradley A. Lee W.-H. Herrup K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2008-2021Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the retinoblastoma protein is approximately 110 kDa, raising the possibility that NARP114 may be the bovine retinoblastoma protein. Finally, we previously showed that Sp1 and Sp3 are involved in β4 gene expression via their interactions with E2, which is located immediately downstream of E1 (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar). 2C. B. Bigger, I. N. Melnikova, and P. D. Gardner, unpublished results. We hypothesized that Sp1 and Sp3 may interact with the proteins that bind to E1 (14Bigger C.B. Casanova E.A. Gardner P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32842-32848Google Scholar).2 With the identification of NARP43 as Purα, we are now in a position to begin testing that hypothesis. We thank Drs. Wen-Hwa Lee and Phang-Lang Chen for the GST-Purα construct, Dr. Edward M. Johnson for anti-Purα antibodies, Drs. William Lane and John Neveu of the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for amino acid sequencing, the folks at Kiolbassa Provision Company for bovine brains, and our colleagues in the Department of Molecular Medicine (in particular, Drs.

Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues located in the COOH terminus of rhodopsin is the first step in this process, followed by the binding of arrestin. In this study, a series of mutants was generated in which these COOH-terminal phosphorylation substrate sites were substituted with alanines. These mutants were expressed in HEK-293 cells and analyzed for their ability to be phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase and to bind arrestin. The results demonstrate that rhodopsin kinase can efficiently phosphorylate other serine and threonine residues in the absence of the sites reported to be the preferred substrates for rhodopsin kinase. A correlation was observed between the level of rhodopsin phosphorylation and the amount of arrestin binding to these mutants. However, mutants T340A and S343A demonstrated a significant reduction in arrestin binding even though the level of phosphorylation was similar to that of wild-type rhodopsin. Substitution of Thr-340 and Ser-343 with glutamic acid residues (T340E and S343E, respectively) was not sufficient to promote the binding of arrestin in the absence of phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase. When S343E was phosphorylated, its ability to bind arrestin was similar to that of wild-type rhodopsin. Surprisingly, arrestin binding to phosphorylated T340E did not increase to the level observed for wild-type rhodopsin. These results suggest that 2 amino acids, Thr-340 and Ser-343, play important but distinct roles in promoting the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin. Rhodopsin, the rod cell photoreceptor, undergoes rapid desensitization upon exposure to light, resulting in uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein, transducin (Gt).

These results suggest that 2 amino acids, Thr-340 and Ser-343, play important but distinct roles in promoting the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin. Receptor desensitization is a critical process in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways. Serine and threonine residues located either in the COOH terminus or in the third cytoplasmic loop of these receptors serve as substrates for phosphorylation by members of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family. The G protein-coupled receptor kinases are unique serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate only the ligand-activated form of G protein-coupled receptors (1Palczewski K. Benovic J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 387-391Google Scholar, 2Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is followed by the binding of arrestin to the receptor, resulting in rapid termination of G protein activation (3Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-4Google Scholar, 4Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Google Scholar, 5Yarfitz S. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14329-14332Google Scholar). The physiological importance of rapid receptor desensitization has been demonstrated directly in studies of the visual signal transduction system, in which expression of a truncated form of rhodopsin missing the phosphorylation sites and a selective reduction in the levels of arrestin both lead to extended rhodopsin activity (6Ranganathan R. Stevens C.F. Cell. 1995; 81: 841-848Google Scholar, 7Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Google Scholar). Rhodopsin, the photoreceptor of the rod cell, has been used extensively as a model for investigating the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (4Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2323-2331Google Scholar). As many as 7 serines and threonines located in the COOH terminus of rhodopsin are substrates in vitro for rhodopsin kinase, the rod cell G protein-coupled receptor kinase, when rhodopsin is activated by light (8Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Google Scholar). However, several studies have suggested that only 1–2 phosphates are incorporated into rhodopsin in vivo. The binding of rod cell-specific arrestin to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin and the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol after light exposure appear to prevent higher levels of phosphorylation (9Ohguro H. Johnson R.S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1023-1028Google Scholar, 10Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14259-14262Google Scholar). The preferred sites of phosphorylation have been reported to be Ser-334, Ser-338, and Ser-343 depending on whether experiments were performed in vivo,in vitro, or with synthetic peptides as substrates for rhodopsin kinase (9Ohguro H. Johnson R.S. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1023-1028Google Scholar, 10Ohguro H. Van Hooser J.P. Milam A.H. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Sharma R. Akhtar M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 659-667Google Scholar). Phosphorylated rhodopsin induces a conformational change in arrestin that promotes its binding to light-activated rhodopsin, interfering with the ability of rhodopsin to activate its G protein, Gt (17Palczewski K. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Google Scholar, 18Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Google Scholar). However, the requirement for specific phosphorylation sites for arrestin binding has not been addressed. In this study, site-directed mutants containing alanine substitutions for the COOH-terminal serine and threonine residues of rhodopsin were expressed in HEK-293 cells and examined for their ability to be phosphorylated and to bind arrestin. The results indicate that rhodopsin kinase can efficiently phosphorylate other serine and threonine residues in the absence of its preferred substrate residues (Ser-334, Ser-338, and Ser-343). A correlation was observed between the levels of rhodopsin phosphorylation and the amount of arrestin binding to the mutants. Two amino acids, Thr-340 and Ser-343, were found to be particularly critical for efficient arrestin binding to rhodopsin, but they may play different roles in promoting this process. The mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA1/Amp was purchased from Invitrogen. An expression vector for SV40 T antigen (pRSV-TAg) and the cDNA for bovine opsin were gifts from Dr. Jeremy Nathans. The cDNA for bovine arrestin was a gift from Dr. Toshimichi Shinohara. 11-cis-Retinal was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche. The monoclonal antibody R2-15N, which recognizes the NH2-terminal 15 amino acids of bovine rhodopsin (19Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Hargrave. Frozen bovine retinas were obtained from J. A. Lawson Inc. (Lincoln, NB). HEK-293 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. [32P]ATP and [35S]methionine were from Amersham Corp. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate system for in vitro synthesis of bovine arrestin was purchased from Promega. The Bio-Spin columns were from Bio-Rad. The cDNA for bovine rhodopsin (20Nathans J. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1983; 34: 807-814Google Scholar) was inserted into the HindIII site of the vector pSelect (Promega) to generate a single-stranded DNA template for mutagenesis (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar). Mutations in the COOH terminus of rhodopsin were made using a Promega Altered Sites mutagenesis kit as described previously (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar). The mutants were sequenced for verification using Sequenase (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Mutants were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells using DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection as described previously (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids pRSV-TAg and pcDNA1/Amp containing the rhodopsin cDNA. Approximately 65–70 h after transfection, membranes were prepared by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (22Nathans J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 937-942Google Scholar, 21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The mutants were analyzed for their ability to activate Gt and to bind 11-cis-retinal using methods described previously (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar, 24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar). Rhodopsin expressed in HEK-293 cells was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody R2-15N. Details for immunoblotting and electrophoresis have been described previously (25Weiss E.R. Hadcock J.R. Johnson G.L. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4319-4323Google Scholar). The level of rhodopsin expression was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Because of the heterogeneity observed in the mobility of the expressed rhodopsin, due to multiple forms of glycosylation, the entire lane was measured for each sample (24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar). After subtraction of a background estimated from a lane of nontransfected cell membranes, the amount of rhodopsin was calculated using rod outer segment rhodopsin as a standard. A 62-kDa band was observed in Western blots of wild-type rhodopsin expressed in HEK-293 cells (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar, 24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar, 26Osawa S. Weiss E.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1036-1040Google Scholar) and in mutants T340E/S343E, T340E, and S343E, but was reduced in the alanine-containing mutants (data not shown). This band, which accounts for ∼10% of the total rhodopsin, was not phosphorylated (data not shown) and was considered to be inactive. Therefore, the amount of rhodopsin represented by this band was subtracted from the total estimated by immunoblot analysis. Urea-stripped rod outer segment membranes were purified from frozen, dark-adapted bovine retinas as described previously (27Weiss E.R. Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6150-6154Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase was prepared as a crude extract from light-exposed rod outer segment membranes (28Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Protein Phosphorylation Res. 1985; 10: 579-591Google Scholar, 29Kelleher D.J. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2632-2639Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of bovine rhodopsin expressed in HEK-293 cells was performed using methods similar to those described by Shiet al. (24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar). HEK-293 cell membranes expressing bovine rhodopsin were reconstituted with 14 μm11-cis-retinal for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by the addition of rod outer segment extract containing rhodopsin kinase (∼20 μl) to a 70-μl reaction mixture consisting of the HEK-293 cell membranes, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 260 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.125 mm EDTA, 0.125 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 150 μm[γ-32P]ATP (300 μCi/ml). The amount of rhodopsin in each reaction was 0.33 μg unless otherwise specified. The amount of total membrane protein in each sample was equalized by the addition of nontransfected HEK-293 cell membranes. The reaction mixture was incubated in the dark under Eastman Kodak No. 2 safelights or under fluorescent room light for 8 min unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. The time of 8 min was chosen because the progress of the reaction is close to linear while still giving a detectable signal (24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by placing the samples on ice for 2 min, followed by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm ATP (buffered to pH 7.5 with Tris-HCl). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature, the pellets were dissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 1.5% octyl glucoside, and the reaction mixture was centrifuged to remove insoluble material. The rhodopsin in the supernatant was immunoprecipitated by incubation with the R2-15N monoclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h each at room temperature. After three washes in TBS containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 50 mm NaF, the protein was extracted from the beads with Laemmli SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis of the dried gels. After subtraction of the amount of phosphorylation in samples incubated in the dark from the amount obtained in samples exposed to light, the data were normalized to the level of phosphorylation of wild-type rhodopsin. To determine the stoichiometry of the phosphate incorporated into wild-type rhodopsin, the lanes of the gels were cut, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. During 8–10-min reactions, ∼0.4 ± 0.2 mol (S.E.) of phosphate/mol of wild-type rhodopsin is incorporated. For the arrestin binding studies, HEK-293 cell membranes containing bovine rhodopsin were prephosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, and 6 mmMgCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h under fluorescent light or in the dark, as described for each experiment in the figure legends (31Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Google Scholar, 32Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 mol/mol of wild-type rhodopsin. Equal amounts of rhodopsin were used for each mutant. To correct for differences in the expression levels of the various mutants, nontransfected cell membranes were added so that the amount of total protein was also the same for each sample. After a 1-h incubation with rhodopsin kinase to phosphorylate the rhodopsin, the reaction was diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The membranes phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase were washed twice with Buffer A by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The rhodopsin was regenerated with 14 μm11-cis-retinal as described above. The cDNA for bovine arrestin (33Wistow G.J. Katial A. Craft C. Shinohara T. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 23-28Google Scholar) was inserted into pSP73 (Promega) and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The synthesized arrestin RNA was translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate at 30 °C for 1 h in the presence of 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1200 μCi/ml) in a final volume of 25 μl according to the manufacturer's instructions. The synthesized product was centrifuged through a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column to remove unincorporated [35S]methionine and to exchange the buffer for one containing 30 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.5 (Buffer B). The amount of synthesized arrestin was estimated from the amount of radioactive methionine incorporated into a hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction measured by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (34Bollum F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 12: 169-173Google Scholar). Approximately 10 fmol of arrestin was used in the arrestin binding assay unless otherwise noted. The arrestin binding assay was performed using methods similar to those described by Gurevich and Benovic (31Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21919-21923Google Scholar, 32Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Google Scholar). The radiolabeled arrestin and the membranes containing phosphorylated bovine rhodopsin regenerated with 11-cis-retinal were incubated together in Buffer B at 37 °C for 5 min under fluorescent room light. The samples contained 0.1–1.0 μg of rhodopsin as noted in the figure legends. The reaction was terminated by dilution with 200 μl of ice-cold Buffer B. The reaction mixture was layered over a 200-μl cushion of 0.2 m sucrose in Buffer B and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 2 °C. After washing with Buffer B, the membrane pellets containing bound arrestin were dissolved in Laemmli SDS sample buffer and chromatographed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of arrestin bound to rhodopsin was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The amount of arrestin bound to nonphosphorylated rhodopsin was subtracted from the amount bound to phosphorylated rhodopsin. The results were normalized to the amount of arrestin bound to wild-type rhodopsin. Statistical tests were performed using the Macintosh computer program Statview (Abacus Concepts, Inc.). Apparent Kd and apparentBmax values (referred to below asKd and Bmax) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the arrestin binding data using the computer program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The COOH-terminal 7 serine and threonine residues within the rhodopsin sequence Ser-334–Ser-343 have been proposed to be substrates for rhodopsin kinase in vitro(Fig. 1) (8Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of these serine and threonine residues to be phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase and to evaluate their importance for arrestin binding, we compared the phosphorylation of wild-type rhodopsin with that of phosphorylation site mutants expressed in HEK-293 cells and examined the ability of these mutants to bind arrestin. An assay was developed to measure the binding of in vitrotranslated arrestin to rhodopsin expressed in HEK-293 cells. Fig.2 A demonstrates that the binding of arrestin to HEK-293 cell membranes containing light-exposed wild-type rhodopsin is phosphorylation-dependent; the binding of arrestin to phosphorylated rhodopsin is typically ∼10 times the level of binding to nonphosphorylated rhodopsin. Fig. 2 A also shows that arrestin does not bind significantly to membranes from nontransfected cells. Previously, our laboratory developed an assay to measure the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin mutants by rhodopsin kinase (24Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Google Scholar). This assay was used to determine whether the sites phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase that promote arrestin binding are restricted to the COOH terminus. The rhodopsin mutant K325stop, in which Lys-325 is replaced by a stop codon causing a deletion of the COOH-terminal 24 amino acids (21Weiss E.R. Osawa S. Shi W. Dickerson C.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7587-7593Google Scholar), was expressed in HEK-293 cells and analyzed for its ability to be phosphorylated and to bind arrestin. The light-dependent phosphorylation of K325stop is <2% of the level observed for wild-type rhodopsin (Fig. 2 B). This result is consistent with previous studies in which the removal of the COOH-terminal 21 amino acids by proteolysis abolished the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by rhodopsin kinase (35Miller J.L. Dratz E.A. Vision Res. 1984; 24: 1509-1521Google Scholar, 36Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Google Scholar). Our experiments also demonstrate that K325stop does not bind arrestin (Fig.2 C). Therefore, the phosphorylation sites that promote arrestin binding to rhodopsin are restricted to these COOH-terminal 7 serine and threonine residues. To determine whether these phosphorylation sites differ in their ability to promote arrestin binding, a series of mutants was generated in which the 7 serine and threonine residues were substituted with alanines. Alanine was chosen because it is a neutral amino acid and is less likely to disrupt protein secondary structure (37Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 105: 1-14Google Scholar, 38Klapper M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 1018-1024Google Scholar, 39Rose G.D. Geselowitz A.R. Lesser G.L. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-838Google Scholar). Initially, S334A/T335A/T336A, S338A/T340A, and T342A/S343A were generated to divide the 7 serine and threonine residues into three mutants (Fig.3). The mutants were assayed for their ability to be phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase and to bind arrestin. The triple mutant S334A/T335A/T336A demonstrated only an 18% decrease in phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylation was reduced by 40 and 33% for mutants S338A/T340A and T342A/S343A, respectively (Fig.4 A). S334A/T335A/T336A showed an 18% reduction in arrestin binding compared with wild-type rhodopsin (Fig.4 B). In contrast, S338A/T340A and T342A/S343A exhibited an 87% and a 68% reduction in arrestin binding, respectively, suggesting that the phosphorylation sites critical for promoting arrestin binding to rhodopsin are located within the sequence containing Ser-338, Thr-340, Thr-342, and Ser-343.Figure 4Phosphorylation of and arrestin binding to rhodopsin mutants. A, phosphorylation. Membranes prepared from transfected HEK-293 cells were reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal and phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase for 8 min. The results were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures” and normalized to the level of phosphorylation for wild-type rhodopsin (op(wt)). The data represent the averages of two to nine experiments, each performed in duplicate, from at least two transfections. Error bars represent S.E. B, arrestin binding. The membranes prepared from transfected HEK-293 cells were reconstituted with 11-cis-retinal and phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase for 1 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrestin binding was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using 1 μg (25 pmol) of rhodopsin and 10 fmol of arrestin per assay. The results were normalized to the level of arrestin binding for wild-type rhodopsin. The data represent the averages of two to five experiments performed in duplicate from at least two transfections.Error bars represent S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on these results, additional double amino acid mutants, S338A/S343A and T340A/S343A; the single amino acid mutants S338A, T340A, T342A, and S343A; and two mutants with five alanine substitutions, STTST and STTTT (Fig. 3), were constructed. A comparison of all of the mutants revealed that the level of phosphorylation decreased approximately in proportion to the number of remaining phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4 A). The double amino acid mutants showed a greater decrease in phosphorylation than the single amino acid mutants. STTST, which is missing all of the phosphorylation sites except for Thr-340 and Ser-343, and STTTT, which is missing all of the COOH-terminal serines and threonines except for Ser-338 and Ser-343, showed the greatest reduction in phosphorylation, 60 and 64%, respectively. The single exception was the triple amino acid mutant S334A/T335A/T336A, which demonstrated a level of phosphorylation that was within the range of the single amino acid mutants. These mutants were also tested for their ability to bind arrestin (Fig.4 B). All four mutants containing two alanine substitutions showed reduced arrestin binding compared with wild-type rhodopsin. For the single amino acid mutants, T340A and S343A exhibited a 55% and a 30% reduction, respectively, whereas S338A and T342A showed no significant decrease in arrestin binding. These data indicate that Thr-340 and Ser-343 are important for the binding of arrestin to rhodopsin. STTTT showed the greatest decrease (94%) in arrestin binding. The level of arrestin binding was plotted against the level of phosphorylation for each mutant to determine whether a correlation between these two properties could be observed (Fig. 5). Although there is variability within groups missing the same number of phosphorylation sites, the results demonstrate that arrestin binding increases as the level of phosphorylation increases. A Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83 was calculated from these data, indicating that 69% (0.832) of the variation in arrestin binding among the different mutants is due to differences in phosphorylation (40McCall R.B. Fundamental Statistics for Psychology.Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 1975; Google Scholar). These data suggest that the level of phosphorylation has a significant influence on the level of arrestin binding. The reduced binding of arrestin to T340A and S343A could be due either to a reduced affinity for rhodopsin or to a reduction in the number of binding sites. To distinguish between these possibilities, the amount of arrestin bound to T340A and S343A was measured as a function of arrestin concentration (Fig. 6). TheKd values (means ± S.E. of five to six experiments performed in duplicate) for T340A and S343A were 0.91 ± 0.12 and 1.0 ± 0.3 nm, respectively, similar to the value of 0.74 ± 0.11 nm for wild-type rhodopsin. Therefore, these rhodopsin mutants display only small changes in affinity for arrestin. In contrast, the number of binding sites (Bmax) for the mutants was dramatically reduced for the binding of arrestin to the mutants compared with binding to wild-type rhodopsin. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6, theBmax values were 7.8 and 5.9 fmol for T340A and S343A, respectively, compared with 11.9 fmol for wild-type rhodopsin. Although the absolute values for Bmax varied considerably between experiments, the values for the mutants were always significantly lower than those for wild-type rhodopsin; for T340A and S343A, the Bmax values (±S.E.) were 50.1 ± 0.1 and 48.8 ± 0.1%, respectively, of the values for wild-type rhodopsin. These data indicate that mutation of Thr-340 and Ser-343 to alanine results in a change inBmax rather than a change in affinity for arrestin. The negatively charged amino acids glutamic acid and aspartic acid have been shown to successfully mimic phosphorylated serine and threonine residues (41Morrison P. Takishima K. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15536-15543Google Scholar, 42Schneider J. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1598-1605Google Scholar, 43Wittekind M. Reizer J. Deutscher J. Saier M.H. Klevit R.E.

To determine whether a negative charge at Thr-340 or Ser-343 is sufficient to promote arrestin binding, mutants T340E, S343E, and T340E/S343E were constructed (Fig. 3). Compared with T340A/S343A, which showed a 43% reduction in phosphorylation, T340E/S343E exhibited a level of phosphorylation only 19% lower than that of wild-type rhodopsin (Fig.4 A). This appeared to be due to an increased rate of phosphorylation (Fig. 7, A and B), suggesting that negative charges at these positions enhance the ability of rhodopsin kinase to phosphorylate the remaining serine and threonine residues. The levels of phosphorylation for T340E and S343E were similar to those for the corresponding alanine mutants, T340A and S343A (Fig. 4 A). Studies of mutants T340E/S343E, S343E, and T340E demonstrated that negative charges at these positions alone are not sufficient to promote arrestin binding in the absence of phosphorylation by rhodopsin kinase (data not shown). However, after phosphory"

Activation of CADTK by a thapsigargin-dependent increase in intracellular calcium failed to stimulate the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase pathway but was well correlated with a 30–50-fold activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In contrast, Ang II, which increased both protein kinase C (PKC) activity and intracellular calcium, stimulated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase but produced a smaller, less sustained, JNK activation than thapsigargin. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which slowly activated CADTK, did not stimulate JNK. These findings suggest either that CADTK is not involved in JNK activation or PKC activation inhibits the CADTK to JNK pathway. A 1-min TPA pretreatment of GN4 cells inhibited thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation by 80–90%. In contrast, TPA did not inhibit the >50-fold JNK activation effected by anisomycin or UV. The consequence of PKC-dependent JNK inhibition was reflected in c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA induction following treatment with thapsigargin and Ang II. Thapsigargin, which only minimally induced c-Fos, produced a much greater and more prolonged c-Jun response than Ang II. Elevation of another intracellular second messenger, cAMP, for 5–15 min also inhibited calcium-dependent JNK activation by ∼80–90% but likewise had no effect on the stress-dependent JNK pathway. In summary, two pathways stimulate JNK in cells expressing CADTK, a calcium-dependent pathway modifiable by PKC and cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a stress-activated pathway independent of CADTK, PKC, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase; the inhibition by PKC can ultimately alter gene expression initiated by a calcium signal.

There are at least three and perhaps four subfamilies of MAPKs: (i) p44 and p42 MAPKs (MAPK1 and -2) also referred to as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and -2) (1Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Google Scholar); (ii) p54 and p46 stress-activated protein kinases 1 and 2, also referred to as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 (JNK1 and -2) (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Google Scholar); (iii) p38 MAPK (3Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Google Scholar), the closest mammalian homologue of the yeast osmosensing ERK HOG1; and (iv) a potential subfamily member, the as yet unsequenced, 88-kDa c-Fos-regulating protein kinase (4Deng T. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 371: 171-175Google Scholar). The known subfamilies are related by three common characteristics. First, they share high sequence homology and presumably similar structure and conformation (5Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar). Second, all appear to be activated by protein kinase cascades initiated by small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins in the Ras superfamily with subsequent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MEKKs) activation (6Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar, 7Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Google Scholar). Third, the last step in activation requires a dual specificity kinase, e.g. the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (8Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-480Google Scholar) and stress-activated protein kinase kinases (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Google Scholar, 7Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Google Scholar), which phosphorylate both Thr and Tyr residues. Dual site phosphorylation of the sequence TEY, TPY, or TGY at the lips of the catalytic clefts of these protein kinases is the defining property of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, respectively (9Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Google Scholar). mitogen-activated protein kinase angiotensin II calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase p70 ribosomal S6 kinase p90 ribosomal S6 kinase p125 focal adhesion kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate cAMP-dependent protein kinase protein kinase C isobutylmethylxanthine mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase epidermal growth factor 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate sodium salt. On the other hand, each subfamily also has distinct characteristics (7Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Google Scholar). First, they are activated by different stimuli, ERKs by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (6Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar) or PKC (5Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar) and JNK by stress signals (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Google Scholar), such as inflammatory cytokines or UV irradiation. Second, each has substrate preferences (10Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Google Scholar), e.g. Elk-1, SAP1, and phospholipase A2 for ERKs, c-Jun and ATF2 for JNK, and ATF2 and Max for p38 MAPK. Third, activation regulates distinct cellular responses; ERKs lead to cell growth and differentiation (6Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar), while in some cells JNKs and p38 MAPK inhibit cell growth or may promote either necrotic or apoptotic cell death (2Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Google Scholar). The present study examines the calcium-dependent pathway to JNK activation (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar) and defines two mechanisms (PKC- and PKA-dependent) that modify its output. We had previously shown that the calcium-dependent JNK pathway was PKC-independent as demonstrated by the fact that Ang II stimulates JNK more effectively in PKC-depleted cells than in control cells (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar). This phenomenon was initially thought to be secondary to abrogation of the PKC-dependent negative feedback on the Ang II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/calcium signal (12Hepler J.R. Earp H.S. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7610-7619Google Scholar). The stimulation of JNK by Ang II or thapsigargin appears to be initiated by a nonreceptor calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK) that we have purified and cloned (13Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Google Scholar, 14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). CADTK is highly related to the focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, p125FAK, and is the same tyrosine kinase identified recently by three other groups (PYK2, CAKβ, and RAFTK) (15Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Google Scholar, 16Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Google Scholar). Thapsigargin-dependent activation of JNK is well correlated with CADTK expression and activation (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar), and Tokiwaet al. have provided direct evidence for the CADTK/PYK2 to JNK pathway (18Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Google Scholar). However, the role of CADTK in JNK activation was thrown into doubt when we established that tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA)-dependent activation of PKC stimulated CADTK but not JNK. We therefore investigated whether PKC activation had a second role, the inhibition of the CADTK signal to JNK. Our results showed that prior stimulation of PKC decreased calcium-dependent JNK activation by ∼80–90%; inhibition was observed with TPA treatment either before or shortly after the addition of thapsigargin to cultured cells. Further studies showed that this inhibitory TPA action was mediated by PKC and not by the TPA-dependent secondary activation of ERK. Another second messenger pathway, PKA, also inhibited calcium-dependent JNK activation. However, neither PKC nor PKA blunted anisomycin-dependent JNK activation, demonstrating the existence of at least two independent pathways to JNK (calcium and stress) in cells expressing CADTK. The PKC-dependent attenuation of JNK activation has biological consequences,e.g. thapsigargin, which produces a calcium signal, is a much stronger inducer of c-Jun mRNA than Ang II, which generates both calcium and PKC signals. In summary, cells expressing CADTK may use PKC or PKA to balance ERK- or JNK-dependent alternation in gene expression in response to G-protein-coupled receptors. Human recombinant EGF was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Angiotensin II (Ang II) was purchased from Sigma and prepared in 50 mm acetic acid as stock solution. TPA, thapsigargin, and bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester were purchased from Sigma and Biomol, respectively, and prepared as stock solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). 8-CPT-cAMP was purchased from Biomol. Anti-Tyr(P) monoclonal antibodies RC20H and pT66 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Sigma, respectively. Anti-ERK polyclonal antibody k-23 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-CADTK polyclonal antibody was produced by using GST-CADTK fusion protein as described previously (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). Rat liver epithelial cells, GN4, were grown in Richter's improved minimal essential medium with 0.1 μm insulin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (13Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Google Scholar). Cell lysate preparation was performed essentially as described previously (13Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with agonists were scraped into ice-cold cell lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) with freshly added 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 kallikrein inhibitor units of aprotinin/ml. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C prior to use. In vitro kinase assays were carried out as described previously with GST-c-Jun-(1–79) linked to Sepharose beads as the substrate (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of cell lysates were incubated with 12 μl of GST-c-Jun beads in lysis buffer. The reaction mixture was then rotated for 2 h. After the incubation, the reaction mixture was pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The pellets were resuspended in 35 μl of kinase buffer containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and chilled to stop the kinase reaction. After removing excess kinase buffer, samples were boiled with 10 μl of 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining, autoradiography, and PhosphorImager analysis. Activation of ERKs was determined as described previously (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of cell lysates were resolved by 15% low bisacrylamide SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for analysis by immunoblotting with the anti-ERK antibody, K-23. The immunoblot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies and developed according to the manufacturer's procedure (Amersham Corp.). In a typical experiment, 500 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, and then 20 μl of protein A or protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) were added for an additional 1 h. Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore Corp.). Proteins were detected by incubating the blots with the appropriate antibody and visualized by using ECL reagents as described before (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). Total RNA of GN4 cells, treated with Ang II (1 μm), EGF (100 ng/ml), and thapsigargin (2 μm) for the indicated times, were prepared with Trizol® solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). 30 μg of total RNAs were separated on 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to Zeta-Probe® GT blotting membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The membrane was probed with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the random primed DNA labeling method (Boehringer Mannheim), washed with washing buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then subjected to autoradiography. 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA were stained by 1% methylene blue to show even loading. Previous attempts to dissect the role of calcium and PKC in GN4 cell signaling revealed that both Ang II and thapsigargin increased tyrosine phosphorylation as well as JNK and AP-1 activity in GN4 cells depleted of >95% of their PKC (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar, 19Huckle W.R. Prokop C.A. Dy R.C. Herman B. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6290-6298Google Scholar, 20Huckle W.R. Earp H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8837-8841Google Scholar). Moreover, Ang II-dependent JNK activation was at least 2-fold greater in PKC-depleted cells, a fact that we initially ascribed to the negative feedback of PKC on Ang II signaling (12Hepler J.R. Earp H.S. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7610-7619Google Scholar). When we identified CADTK as the major calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase in GN4 cells (13Earp H.S. Huckle W.R. Dawson T.L. Li X. Graves L.M. Dy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28440-28447Google Scholar) and correlated its stimulation and expression with JNK activation (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar), a linkage between CADTK and JNK activation was apparent with one exception. TPA treatment of GN4 cells activated CADTK but not JNK. Either CADTK was not causally related to JNK activation or TPA inhibited JNK activation at a site distal to CADTK. To elucidate an inhibitory role for PKC, we first examined in detail the time course of calcium-dependent JNK activation by thapsigargin and Ang II. We had previously demonstrated that Ang II was a stronger activator of JNK than thapsigargin in cells depleted of >95% of their PKC by an overnight TPA pretreatment (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar). In the present studies, we used unpretreated GN4 cells and showed the opposite result; thapsigargin stimulated JNK activity to a greater extent and for a longer duration than Ang II (Fig. 1). The initial burst of JNK activity was similar for both agonists, but by 20–30 min the magnitude of the thapsigargin response was consistently 2–2.5-fold greater in repeated experiments. To directly test the hypothesis that the PKC signal inhibited the calcium-dependent JNK pathway, we pretreated GN4 cells with 100 nm TPA for 1–10 min. Pretreatment for as little as 1 min decreased thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation by 80–90% (Fig. 2 A), and a 15-s pretreatment showed a significant inhibition (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, TPA pretreatment did not alter the stress pathway typified by anisomycin-dependent JNK activation (Fig. 2 A) or exposure to 100 J/m2 of UV (data not shown). These results delineated separate JNK activation pathways, one inhibited by TPA, the other not. Interestingly, TPA added for 1 or 2.5 min after thapsigargin also decreased calcium-dependent JNK activation by ∼50% at 30 min, mimicking the difference observed between treatment with thapsigargin (calcium) and Ang II (calcium and PKC) at 30 min (Fig. 1). TPA treatment 5 min after thapsigargin had little or no inhibitory effect, suggesting that there is a limited time span in which the PKC signal can influence the CADTK to JNK pathway (Fig. 2 B). A dose response performed using a 10-min TPA preincubation showed that as little as 10 nm TPA blocked thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation (Fig. 3 B). This effect of TPA was mediated by its ability to activate PKC; the TPA inhibitory effect was abolished by depleting cells of >95% PKC using an overnight TPA (5 μm, 18 h) pretreatment (data not shown). Last, because the PKC signal produced by TPA activates ERK, we tested whether it was the PKC or the ERKs activation attenuating the CADTK to JNK pathway. EGF strongly activates ERKs in GN4 cells, but pretreatment with EGF for 1–5 min failed to inhibit thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation (Fig. 3 C). This suggests that inhibition of the CADTK to JNK pathway is mediated directly by a TPA-sensitive PKC isoform.Figure 3TPA inhibits calcium-dependent JNK activation, but EGF does not. GN4 cells were pretreated with TPA (100 nm) for the indicated times (A), were pretreated with different concentrations of TPA for 10 min (B), or were pretreated for the indicated times with EGF or TPA (C). Cells were then treated with thapsigargin (Thaps) (2 μm) for 30 min. Cell lysates were prepared, and JNK activity assays were performed. The inhibitory effect of TPA appears to be mediated by PKC, not by the TPA-dependent activation of ERKs, since EGF, which maximally activates ERKs via a Ras-dependent PKC-independent mechanism, does not inhibit calcium-dependent JNK activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test whether TPA simply blocked the putative first step of Ang II or thapsigargin action, the activation of CADTK, GN4 cells were pretreated with or without TPA, and CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation was examined (Fig. 4). TPA pretreatment did not inhibit, and in fact enhanced, thapsigargin-dependent CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, TPA also increases CADTK tyrosine kinase activity assessed by immune complex kinase activity (14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar) using poly(Glu4Tyr) as a substrate (data not shown). Therefore, PKC must interfere with elements downstream of CADTK in the calcium-dependent JNK activation pathway. To test the biological consequences of the calcium/PKC signaling cross-talk, we investigated whether Ang II, EGF, and thapsigargin treatment differentially affected Jun and Fos family gene expression. In GN4 cells, the calcium and PKC signals produced by Ang II activate both JNK and ERK and EGF predominately activates ERK and has little effect on JNK, whereas thapsigargin strongly activates JNK (Fig. 1) and has little effect on ERK activation (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar, 14Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T. Wilm M. Anderegg R. Graves L. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Google Scholar). GN4 cells were stimulated with Ang II, EGF, and thapsigargin for the indicated times, and total RNA was isolated. Northern blot analysis (Fig.5) revealed that thapsigargin strongly stimulated c-Jun expression with expression increasing for up to 2 h; thapsigargin had little effect on c-Fos expression. Ang II also stimulated c-Jun expression, but the induction was weaker and markedly truncated compared with thapsigargin. Ang II significantly stimulated c-Fos expression, consistent with the effect on the ERK pathway. These data support the hypothesis that the negative effect of PKC on Ang II-dependent JNK activation has important consequences for c-Jun expression. As expected, EGF strongly activated c-Fos expression. Interestingly, EGF, which had little stimulatory effect on JNK in GN4 cells (Figs.3 C and 7) (11Zohn I. Yu H. Li X. Cox A.D. Earp H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6160-6168Google Scholar), rapidly and potently stimulated c-Jun expression. In contrast to thapsigargin, EGF-dependent c-Jun expression reached its peak after about 30 min and then gradually decreased to its basal level. In some cell types, increased intracellular cAMP and PKA activity inhibits ERK (21Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar, 22Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Google Scholar, 23Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Google Scholar) or JNK activation (24Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18094-18098Google Scholar, 25Rao G.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20805-20810Google Scholar, 26Shapiro P.S. Evans J.N. Davis R.J. Posada J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5750-5754Google Scholar). We investigated whether increasing cAMP would inhibit calcium-dependent JNK activation. GN4 cells were briefly pretreated with forskolin/IBMX or 8-CPT-cAMP. As shown in Fig.6, these compounds have little or no effect on JNK activation. However, pretreatment with forskolin/IBMX or cAMP for even 1 min inhibited the subsequent thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation (Fig. 6A). Longer pretreatment (5–15 min) inhibited thapsigargin-dependent JNK activation by ∼80–90%. Treatment with forskolin/IBMX or 8-CPT-cAMP after the addition of thapsigargin had little or no effect on JNK activation. These data suggest that forskolin/IBMX and 8-CPT-cAMP are effective if added prior to the calcium signal and are most effective when provided 5–15 min prior to the calcium signal. This may indicate that cAMP has a different site of inhibition than TPA, which inhibits the CADTK to JNK signal maximally with a 30–60-s preincubation and can inhibit even when added 1–2 min after administering thapsigargin. However, it is possible that PKA and PKC may share the same site of inhibition with the PKA signal taking slightly longer to develop. We also tested the effect of cAMP on ERK activation. Elevation of cAMP in GN4 cells had no effect on Ang II-dependent ERK activation (Fig. 6 B). This is different from the action of cAMP in other cell types (21Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1065-1069Google Scholar, 22Graves L.M. Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Potts B.C. MacDonald S.G. Ross R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Google Scholar, 23Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Google Scholar). Since the effect of Ang II on ERK in GN4 cells is primarily a Ras/Raf-independent process, 2X. Li, J. W. Lee, L. M. Graves, and H. S. Earp, unpublished data. the lack of cAMP inhibition may not be comparable with other Ras-dependent ERK activation systems. To study the selectivity of cAMP inhibition for the calcium-dependent JNK activation, we pretreated cells with forskolin/IBMX followed by Ang II, thapsigargin, or anisomycin treatment. Like TPA, cAMP inhibited thapsigargin and Ang II-dependent JNK activation but failed to affect JNK activation by anisomycin (Fig. 7), providing further evidence of distinct pathways to JNK stimulated by calcium and stress. We have previously shown that a calcium signal in GN4 cells stimulates the p70S6K pathway but have not generated direct evidence for CADTK involvement (27Graves L.M. He Y. Lambert J. Hunter D. Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent p70S6K pathway is blocked by wortmannin and rapamycin (27Graves L.M. He Y. Lambert J. Hunter D. Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Google Scholar), known inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and the rapamycin-sensitive kinase, respectively. Both of these enzymes have been implicated in the activation of p70S6K (28Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Google Scholar, 29Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase or rapamycin-sensitive kinase were involved in calcium-dependent JNK activation, GN4 cells were pretreated with rapamycin (10 mm, 10 min) and wortmannin (50 mm, 10 min), doses that totally inhibit thapsigargin-dependent p70S6K activation (27Graves L.M. He Y. Lambert J. Hunter D. Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1920-1928Google Scholar). Neither wortmannin (data not shown) nor rapamycin (Fig. 7) had any effect on calcium-dependent JNK activation. Thus, the calcium-dependent JNK pathway diverges from the calcium-dependent p70S6K pathway; rapamycin and wortmannin only inhibit the latter. To formally rule out an upstream effect of forskolin/IBMX, rapamycin, or wortmannin on CADTK activation, these compounds were preincubated with GN4 cells before the addition of Ang II. As shown in Fig.8, neither wortmannin, rapamycin, nor forskolin/IBMX altered Ang II-stimulated CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, in GN4 cells, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase kinase and/or rapamycin-sensitive kinase may be downstream of a CADTK signal linked to p70S6K activation, but these enzymes are not involved in the CADTK to JNK pathway or the Ang II to CADTK pathway. Recent studies using cells other than fibroblasts, e.g.cells of epithelial and hematopoietic origin, increasingly demonstrate a role for G-protein-coupled receptors and/or rises in intracellular calcium as mediators of growth control pathways (30Berridge M.J.

https://openalex.org/W2072646254,"When the calcium-permeable cation channel CD20 is expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells, it is activated by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) via the IGF-I receptor (Kanzaki, M., Nie, L., Shibata, H., and Kojima, I. (1997) J. Biol. Chem.272, 4964–4969). The present study was conducted to investigate the role of G proteins in the regulation of the CD20 channel. In the excised patch clamp mode, activation of the CD20 channel by IGF-I required GTP, Mg2+, and ATP in the bath solution, and removal of either GTP or ATP attenuated the activation. Non-hydrolyzable ATP could substitute for ATP, and guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate blocked the activation of the channel by IGF-I. The CD20 channel was also activated by guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, and ATP was not required for the activation. Addition of a preparation of Gi/Goholoprotein purified from bovine brain activated the CD20, and the β-adrenergic receptor kinase peptide did not affect the number of channel openings induced by the G protein. The CD20 channel was stimulated by the GTP-bound form of recombinant Gi2 α subunit purified from Sf9 cells. The Gi3 α subunit was less effective, and the Gi1 α subunit had no effect. Purified recombinant β1γ2 subunits did not affect the activity of the channel. Finally, IGF-I-induced activation of CD20 was inhibited by an antibody against Gi2 α subunit. These findings indicate that the CD20 channel expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells is activated by the IGF-I receptor via the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. When the calcium-permeable cation channel CD20 is expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells, it is activated by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) via the IGF-I receptor (Kanzaki, M., Nie, L., Shibata, H., and Kojima, I.

These findings indicate that the CD20 channel expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells is activated by the IGF-I receptor via the α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. CD20 is a transmembrane protein with molecular mass of 35 kDa that is expressed in B lymphocytes (1Stashenko P. Nadler L.M. Hardy R. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1678-1685Google Scholar). This protein has been considered to be involved in growth regulation since monoclonal antibodies against CD20 modify the growth rate of the cells (2Rosenthal P. Rimm I.J. Uniel T. Graffin J.D. Osathanondh R. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 232-237Google Scholar, 3Nadler L.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Anderson K.C. Boyd A.W. Slaughenhoupt B. Park E. Jensen J. Mayer R.J. Sallan S.E. Ritz J.

Molecular cloning of the CD20 protein has provided information on the putative structure, which resembles that of ion channels and transporters (5Einfeld D.A. Brown J.P. Valentine M.A. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. EMBO J. 1986; 7: 711-717Google Scholar, 6Tedder T.F. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 208-212Google Scholar). Bubienet al. (7Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzell R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Google Scholar) showed that the CD20 channel expressed in fibroblasts functions as a calcium-permeable cation channel. Using whole cell recordings, they showed that CD20 is a voltage-independent cation channel that permeates calcium. Since calcium entry is a prerequisite for the progression through G1 phase (8Kojima I. Mogami H. Shibata H. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10003-10006Google Scholar), we expressed the CD20 channel in Balb/c 3T3 cells and studied the changes in the growth characteristics of the cells (9Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). Indeed, expression of the CD20 channel resulted in three major alterations in G1 progression induced by insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). 1The abbreviations used are:IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor-IG proteinsGTP-binding proteinsEGFepidermal growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineβARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinasenPomean opening probabilityGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateGDPβSguanyl-5′-yl thiophosphateATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)AMP-PNPadenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphateCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. First, expression of the CD20 channel shortened the period required for the entrance to the S phase by accelerating the G1 progression induced by IGF-I. Second, expression of the CD20 channel reduced the dependence of the G1 progression on extracellular calcium, and CD20-expressing cells could progress toward S phase in medium containing lower concentrations of calcium. Third, expression of the CD20 channel enabled IGF-I alone to induce progression in cells arrested in the G0 phase. In Balb/c 3T3 cells, IGF-I is not capable of stimulating DNA synthesis in G0-arrested cells (10Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar). IGF-I promotes G1 progression only when G0-arrested cells are treated sequentially with platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor (EGF) (10Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Google Scholar, 11Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, expression of the CD20 channel at least partly reproduces the effect of platelet-derived growth factor and EGF. These results indicate that the expression of CD20 modulates the action of IGF-I. Our recent study revealed that the calcium-permeable channel activity of CD20 is activated by IGF-I in Balb/c 3T3 cells expressing CD20 (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). When IGF-I is added to quiescent cells expressing CD20, the opening probability of the CD20 is markedly augmented, and calcium entry via the CD20 channel is greatly increased. Interestingly, the effect of IGF-I on the CD20 channel is blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX) (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). Conversely, mastoparan, an activator of Gi/Go (14Higashijima T. Uzu S. Nakajima T. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6491-6494Google Scholar), activated the CD20 channel, and transfection of gip2, a gene encoding constitutive active form of the α subunit of Gi2 (15Lyons J. Landis S. Harsh G. Vollar L. Grunewald K. Feichtinger H. Duh Q.R. Clark O.H. Kawasaki E. Bourne H. McCormick F. Science. 1990; 249: 655-659Google Scholar), also activated the CD20 channel (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that IGF-I activates the CD20 channel by a mechanism involving a PTX-sensitive G protein. The present study was conducted to address this issue, and the data suggest that the CD20 channel is activated principally by the α subunit of Gi2. insulin-like growth factor-I GTP-binding proteins epidermal growth factor phosphate-buffered saline β-adrenergic receptor kinase mean opening probability guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) adenosine 5'-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.

(CBL 456; Southampton, UK) and Coulter Immunology (Coulter clone B1; Hialeah, FL). The anti-Gi2 α subunit antibody was obtained from Calbiochem (anti-Giα1 and Giα2 subunits C-terminal-(345–354) rabbit IgG). Mastoparan was purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Purified Gi/Go was prepared as described previously (16Katada T. Kontani K. Inanobe A. Kobayashi I. Ohoka Y. Nishina I. Takahashi K.

The α subunits of the G proteins Gi1, Gi2, and Gi3 were expressed using the baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system and purified to homogeneity using DEAE, hydroxyapatite, and Mono P chromatography as described previously (18Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1271-1278Google Scholar, 19Graber S.G. Figler R.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 212-226Google Scholar). The recombinant β1γ2 dimers were also expressed using the baculovirus Sf9 cell system and purified as described previously (20Graber S.G. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Methods Neurosci. 1996; 29: 207-226Google Scholar). The C-terminal peptide of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) (21Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Google Scholar) was synthesized by using peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The crude peptide was purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography to better than 98% homogeneity as judged by analytical high performance liquid chromatography. All the chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. Balb/c 3T3 cells (clone A31) were provided by the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Balb/c 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were cultured under humidified conditions of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The inducible CD20 expression vector (CD20-pMEP4) was transfected into Balb/c 3T3 cells by electroporation as described previously (9Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar). CD20 expressing quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells were obtained by incubating confluent cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% platelet-poor plasma and 40 μm ZnCl2 for 24 h. The constitutively active Gi2 mutant (Gip2) expression vector Gip2-pcDNA I was generously provided by Dr. H. Bourne of UCSF. Balb/c 3T3 cells were co-transfected with CD20-pMEP4 and Gip2-pcDNA I using a transfection reagentN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP, Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany). Hygromycin (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan)-resistant colonies were independently picked up and screened by Northern blotting for high expression of Gip2 and CD20 as described previously (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). We performed a binding study using a mAb against CD20 and immunostaining with anti-CD20 antibody to show that the CD20-transfected cells express CD20. For the binding assay, the IgG was iodinated by the chloramine-T method (9Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Mogami H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13099-13104Google Scholar) to a specific activity of approximately 80 mCi/mg. The confluent cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated for 1 h in 0.2% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 125I-labeled IgG (2 × 105 cpm/0.4 ml) at 32 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled antibody. For immunostaining, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed for 10 min in 10% formalin/PBS, washed with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with the anti-CD20 antibody. After washing in PBS, coverslips were incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Kappel, dilution 1:100) at room temperature for 1 h. After a final wash with PBS, samples were mounted in glycerol/PBS. Fluorescence was observed by microscopy (Olympus, Japan). To confirm the expression of Gip2, we performed the immunoblotting and immunostaining of Gi2 α subunit. For immunoblotting, cells were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1000 units/ml trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove unsolubilized materials, and the supernatants were mixed with equal volume of 2-fold concentrated Laemmli electrophoresis sample buffer in the presence of 50 mm mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out using 12% gels, and the protein was blotted to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Yonezawa, Japan). The antibody against the αi2 subunit was used as the primary antibody, and detection was achieved with 125I-labeled protein A (0.2 μCi/ml). The blots were subjected to autoradiography, analyzed using a FUJIX BAS2000, and photographed by a FUJIX Pictrography 3000 (Fuji Photo Film, Japan). Immunostaining was performed as described above except PBS containing 0.1% saponin was used to permeabilize the plasma membrane, and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody was used as the second antibody. The cell-attached patch clamp and the inside-out patch clamp techniques were used for the voltage clamp studies (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). Micropipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries and heat-polished at the tip. They had resistance values between 5 and 8 MΩ after being filled with a pipette solution. High resolution membrane currents were recorded using an EPC-9 patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany) controlled by “Pulse” (HEKA) software on a Macintosh computer. All voltages were corrected for a liquid junction potential between the bath and pipette solutions. Single channel currents were recorded as described by Hamillet al. (22Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Google Scholar). The signal was stored on video tape after analogue/digital conversion (Sony PCM 501 ES, modified by Shoshin EM Corp., Okazaki, Japan). For studies using the cell-attached configuration, the micropipettes were filled with a solution containing 110 mm BaCl2 or CaCl2, 200 nm tetrodotoxin (Seikagaku-Kogyo, Japan), and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted by adding Ba(OH)2 or Ca(OH)2). In some experiments, Cl− was replaced with aspartate. The bath solution contained 137 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH). Single channel recordings were analyzed by using the “EP ANALYSIS” (HEKA) and Igor Pro (Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR). The total number of functional channels (N) in the patch were estimated by observing the number of peaks detected on the amplitude histogram. As an index of channel activity, NPo (number of channels multiplied by the open probability) was calculated as shown in Equation1. NPo=∑n−0nN·tnTEquation 1 where T is the total record time, n is the number of channels open, and tn is the recording time during which n channels are open. Therefore,nPo can be calculated without making assumptions about the total number of channels in a patch or the open probability of a single channel. All electrophysiological experiments were performed at 20–26 °C. All single channel currents were measured with holding potential at −80 mV unless otherwise mentioned. In the experiments using purified or recombinant G proteins, detergent (CHAPS) concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.4 μm (6.14∼245.9 ng/ml). To activate purified G protein holotrimers or recombinant α subunits, the proteins were incubated with an equimolar amount of GTPγS for 15 min at 25 °C and applied to the bath solution. This concentration of GTPγS alone was used as control and had no effect (see legend to Figs. 5 and 6).Figure 6CD20 channel activation by recombinant α subunits of Gi. A, single channel current was measured in inside-out patches. Recombinant Giα subunits were preactivated with an equimolar concentration of GTPγS. αi subunits (1 nm) were applied sequentially as indicated. B, NPo calculated from patches treated with various concentrations of αisubunits was calculated. NPo was normalized to the activity obtained by 5 nm αi2.

Results were considered to be significantly different when p < 0.05. Previous experiments have shown that the activity of the CD20 channel in a cell-attached patch is observed when IGF-I is added to the pipette solution and that IGF-I-induced CD20 channel activation is abolished by pretreatment with PTX (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). These findings suggest that IGF-I activates CD20 via a PTX-sensitive G protein. To investigate whether or not IGF-I-induced CD20 channel activation is mediated by a G protein, we performed experiments using inside-out patches. Fig. 1 A shows the results of a representative experiment obtained in an excised patch. The pipette solution contained 110 mm BaCl2 and 1 nm IGF-I. After the patch excision, the single channel currents disappeared even in the presence of 0.4 mm GTP and 4 mm Mg2+ in the bath solution. However, the channel activity appeared again by the subsequent application of 1 mm ATP to the bath. To quantitate the effects of GTP and ATP, we calculated the mean open probability. Fig. 1 B shows the mean open probability of the CD20 channel. As depicted, the CD20 channel openings were rarely detected in the bath solution containing GTP and Mg2+, but the channel openings were observed when ATP was added to the bath solution. Similarly, channel activity was not observed in the excised patch when only ATP and Mg2+ were in the bath, and activity was restored when GTP was added to the bath (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 1 D shows the open probability of the CD20 channel. Similar Ba2+-permeable channels responsive to the internal solution containing ATP, GTP, and Mg2+ were observed in 17/31 inside-out experiments. In experiments without IGF-I in the pipette solution, the current was not observed even if the bath solution contained GTP, Mg2+, and ATP. We assumed that these channels were CD20 since the channel events in either cell-attached or inside-out patches were blocked when a monoclonal antibody against CD20 (CBL456; 2 μg/ml) was present in the pipette solution (see Table I). Table I shows the number of cells in which CD20 was activated by each treatment. In the presence of ATP, GTP, and Mg2+ in the internal side of the membrane, CD20 channel was activated in about 50% of the cells. The open probability also decreased in inside-out patches compared with cell-attached patches. NPo values were 0.44 ± 0.11 and 0.21 ± 0.07 in cell-attached and inside-out patches, respectively. The single channel conductance was about 7 pS in excised patches, and this size was similar to those in cell-attached patches (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar). None of these channel events in inside-out patches were observed in the absence of Mg2+ in the bath solution. Channel activation was not detected by adding GDP instead of GTP (data not shown). Furthermore, pretreatment of the cells with PTX (100 ng/ml for 4 h) abolished the channel activation both in cell-attached and in inside-out patches.Table ICD20 channel activation in cell-attached and inside-out patchesCell-attached patchesInside-out patchesATP + GTP − Mg2+GTP + Mg2+Mg2+None0 /290 /260 /260 /26IGF-I31 /3417 /314 /311 /31IGF-I mAb1 /191 /16NDNDIGF-I (PTX-treated)0 /211 /17NDNDSingle channel current was measured in cell-attached and inside-out patches.

PTX-treated cells were obtained by incubating the cells with 200 ng/ml PTX for 4 h. ND, not determined. Next, we examined the effect of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GTPγS, on CD20 activation in inside-out patches. The pipette solution did not contain IGF-I. Fig.2 shows the effect of GTPγS added to the internal side of the plasma membrane on CD20 channel activity. The channel events were not observed in the cell-attached patch because of the absence of IGF-I (Fig. 2, top trace). After the patch excision, the activity of the channel was markedly stimulated by adding 0.1 mm GTPγS alone but not by GDPβS (data not shown) in the presence of 4 mm Mg2+. The effect of GTPγS was dose-dependent and, at concentrations less than 1 μm, GTPγS did not activate the CD20 channel (data not shown). The channels activated by GTPγS had identical conductance to the CD20 channel stimulated by IGF-I (pipette), GTP, and ATP (bath) in inside-out patches. Channel events induced by GTPγS were abolished by the mAb against CD20 (data not shown). ATP in the internal side of the membrane was required for IGF-I-induced CD20 activation. As shown in Table II, however, ATP was not required and had no stimulatory effect on GTPγS-activated CD20 channel events.Table IIEffect of ATP on mastoparan-, GTPγS-, and Gip2-induced CD20 activation in inside-out patchesATP(−)ATP(+)Mastopran-induced (n = 21)100105 ± 8.4GTPγS-induced (n = 10)100102 ± 4.3Gip2-induced (n = 19)100103 ± 6.1Single channel currents were measured in inside-out patches from CD20-expressing cells. Mastoparan (0.1 nm) in the pipette and 100 μm GTPγS in the bath were used as stimulators in “mastoparan-induced” and “GTPγS-induced” experiments, respectively. For the measurement of Gip2-induced CD20, activation patches obtained from Gip2-CD20-expressing cells were incubated in the bath solution containing 0.4 mm GTP and 4 mmMg2+. ATP (1 mm) was subsequently added to the bath solution. NPo values were normalized to the ATP(−) condition in each experiment. Values are the means ± S.E. forn patches obtained in three different experiments. Open table in a new tab Single channel currents were measured in inside-out patches from CD20-expressing cells. Mastoparan (0.1 nm) in the pipette and 100 μm GTPγS in the bath were used as stimulators in “mastoparan-induced” and “GTPγS-induced” experiments, respectively. For the measurement of Gip2-induced CD20, activation patches obtained from Gip2-CD20-expressing cells were incubated in the bath solution containing 0.4 mm GTP and 4 mmMg2+. ATP (1 mm) was subsequently added to the bath solution. NPo values were normalized to the ATP(−) condition in each experiment. Values are the means ± S.E. forn patches obtained in three different experiments. As shown in the above sections, ATP on the internal side of the plasma membrane was required for IGF-I-induced but not for GTPγS-induced CD20 activation in inside-out patches. These results suggest that ATP is essential for IGF-I-induced CD20 activation but is not necessary for CD20 activation when G protein is activated directly. To evaluate this possibility, we examined whether or not ATP is necessary for CD20 activation induced by mastoparan. As shown in Fig. 3 A, GTP and Mg2+ on the internal side of the membrane were required and sufficient for CD20 channel activation with mastoparan in the pipette (21/22 patches). Likewise, when Gip2, a constitutively active mutant of Gi2α, was co-expressed with CD20, ATP was not necessary to activate CD20 (19/19 patches). These channel openings were not augmented by ATP in each condition (Table II). On the other hand, Mg2+ was necessary for CD20 activation, and these channel events disappeared when Mg2+ was removed by adding EDTA (data not shown). Furthermore, in cells activated by mastoparan, CD20 channel events disappeared when GDPβS was added to the internal side of the membrane (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, the CD20 channel activity in Gip2-transfected cells was blocked by EDTA (Fig.3 C). As indicated above, ATP was necessary for IGF-I to activate the CD20 channel in addition to GTP and Mg2+ in excised patch. Since the IGF-I receptor has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the intracellular domain of the β subunit, it is an interesting question whether or not protein phosphorylation is involved in the IGF-I-induced CD20 activation. To address this question, we examined the effect of non-hydrolyzable analogues of ATP, ATPγS and AMP-PNP, on IGF-I-induced CD20 activation in inside-out patches. The pipette solution contained 1 nm IGF-I. As shown in Fig.4 A, the channel activity was detected upon application of either 1 mm AMP-PNP or 1 mmATPγS in the presence of 0.4 mm GTP and 4 mmMg2+. NPo activated by either ATPγS or AMP-PNP was slightly higher than that by ATP (Fig.4 B). In the absence of GTP and Mg2+, neither ATPγS nor AMP-PNP alone had a stimulatory effect. These results suggest that ATP binding rather than hydrolysis of ATP is necessary for IGF-I-induced activation of the G protein. The present findings as well as those of our previous study (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar) indicate that the CD20 channel is regulated by G protein(s). To further assess the involvement of G protein in the regulation of the CD20 channel, we investigated the effect of reconstituting purified G proteins obtained from bovine brain into the excised patches. The preparation used in these experiments contains heterotrimeric Gi and Go proteins. The pipette solution did not contain IGF-I. The purified G protein was pretreated with an equimolar concentration of GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 5, the buffer solution without G protein did not activate the channel, but the GTPγS-activated brain G protein (20 nm) applied to the internal side of CD20-expressing cell membrane patches induced persistent openings of the Ca2+-permeable channel. The channels activated by purified G protein had identical conductance as the CD20 channel stimulated by IGF-I (pipette), GTP and ATP (bath), or GTPγS (bath) alone. These single channel currents were abolished by the mAb against CD20 (data not shown). The G protein-induced activation of the CD20 channel was observed in all patches tested (16/16 patches in three different experiments). Neither GTPγS alone added at 20 nm nor the GDP-bound form of the G proteins activated the channel. The observation that the expression of Gip2 results in CD20 channel activation (13Kanzaki M. Nie L. Shibata H. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4964-4969Google Scholar) suggests the importance of the α subunit of the G protein to activate the CD20 channel. Since both α-GTP and βγ can activate multiple effectors (23Neer E.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 249-257Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the C-terminal peptide of the βARK peptide to assess the possibility that the βγ subunit might be activating the CD20 channel in the excised patches. The C-terminal domain of βARK would be expected to interact with the βγ subunit of the activated G protein and neutralize its action (21Pitcher J.A. Touhara K. Payne E.S. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11707-11710Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the G protein-activated CD20 channel event was not affected by 10 μm βARK peptide (a 500-fold excess of peptide). The βARK peptide had no significant effects on channel events in various conditions using IGF-I, mastoparan, or GTPγS to activate the channel or using patches activated by co-expression of Gip2 (data not shown). These results suggest that the α subunits and not the βγ dimers have a stimul"

Identification of a portion of protein S that binds to C4BP has been approached using random libraries of 6- and 15-mer peptides displayed on bacteriophage surfaces. Bacteriophage binding to the beta-chain of C4BP were selected in several rounds of affinity purification with intervening amplification in E. coli. Homology searches of the affinity purified peptide sequences against protein S led to the identification of four regions in protein S that were similar to several of the selected peptides. These regions were synthesized as linear peptides and tested in inhibition experiments. Only one distinct peak (around position 450) was observed when the homology scores versus human protein S sequence were averaged over all affinity purified peptides. A synthetic peptide comprising residues 439-460 in human protein S was found to inhibit protein S binding to C4BP. The same result was found with two overlapping peptides (residues 447-468 and 435-468, respectively) in a second set of synthetic peptides. Direct binding of the peptides to C4BP was inferred from titrations monitored by recording the near UV circular dichroism spectra or the polarization of tryptophan fluorescence. The results suggest that residues 447-460 constitute a portion of protein S that is important for the interaction with C4BP. These findings may have implications for patients suffering from thrombosis, due to the lack of free protein S, by directing the design of drugs that disrupt protein S binding to C4BP."

A potential pause-transfer sequence has been identified and may be responsible for the translocational pausing observed in this study. The Na+- and Cl−-dependent transporters are a family of complex integral membrane proteins responsible for the reuptake of many neurotransmitters, amino acids, osmolytes, and a variety of other substrates (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Google Scholar, 2Clark J.A. Amara S.G. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 323-332Google Scholar, 3Rudnick G. Clark J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Google Scholar). The GAT-1 aminobutyric acid (GABA) 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; NET, norepinephrine transporter; HD, hydrophobic domain(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. transporter was the first member of this family for which a cDNA was isolated and characterized (4Guastella J. Nelson N. Nelson H. Czyzyk L. Keynan S. Miedel M.C. Davidson N. Lester H. Kanner B. Science. 1990; 249: 1303-1306Google Scholar). Subsequent to identification of a cDNA for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) (5Pacholczyk T. Blakely R.D. Amara S.G. Nature. 1991; 350: 350-354Google Scholar), comparison of the NET amino acid sequence with that of GAT-1 revealed a significant degree of homology and indicated that these transporters might be members of a larger transporter family. The extent and diversity of this transporter family was revealed by the identification of cDNAs for several members with the use of homology cloning strategies. Hydropathy analyses of NET and GAT-1 primary sequences predict that these proteins share many structural features. These include a motif of 12 hydrophobic regions connected by hydrophilic loops; a large extracellular loop connecting hydrophobic domains (HDs) three and four which contains potential sites for N-linked glycosylation; cytoplasmic localization of the amino terminus, based on the lack of a recognizable signal sequence; and cytoplasmic localization of the carboxyl terminus (1Amara S.G. Kuhar M.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 73-93Google Scholar, 2Clark J.A. Amara S.G. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 323-332Google Scholar, 3Rudnick G. Clark J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 249-263Google Scholar). In a small number of orphan members of this transporter family, the predicted structure differs in the presence of a larger hydrophilic loop connecting HDs seven and eight with potential sites forN-linked glycosylation (6Mestikawy S.E.

Some features of this predicted model have been confirmed. Immunocytochemical studies with sequence-directed peptide antibodies have shown that the amino and carboxyl termini of NET are located in the cytoplasm (9Brüss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bönisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Google Scholar). In the same study, the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 and the loop connecting HD7 and HD8 were shown to be extracellular (9Brüss M. Hammermann R. Brimijoin S. Bönisch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9197-9201Google Scholar). In addition, several groups have confirmed that the sites for N-linked glycosylation in the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 are utilized in the norepinephrine, glycine, and serotonin transporters (10Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Google Scholar, 11Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Google Scholar, 12Melikian H.E. McDonald J.K. Gu H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276Google Scholar), consistent with the extracellular placement of this loop. While some features of the predicted model for the transmembrane topology of these transporters have been confirmed, detailed experimental testing of the model has only recently begun (14Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1203-1210Google Scholar, 15Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1211-1217Google Scholar). Knowledge of the transmembrane topology of these important proteins is necessary for understanding how they function. Complex or polytopic integral membrane proteins, such as the Na+- and Cl−-dependent transporters, are synthesized and assembled into their native structure at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (16Katz F.N. Rothman J.E. Lingappa V.R. Blobel G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 3278-3282Google Scholar). Assembly of polytopic proteins is thought to be directed by a series of topogenic sequences which interact with the ER translocation machinery (17Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Google Scholar, 18Wessels H.P. Spiess M. Cell. 1988; 55: 61-70Google Scholar), resulting in translocation and integration of the nascent chain across and into the ER membrane. The sidedness of the hydrophilic loops connecting HDs can be utilized to infer the cellular location of the loops and the transmembrane orientation of the HDs. Protease protection assays of nascent chains in vesicles prepared from ER membranes are one approach that takes advantage of the sidedness of integral membrane proteins. This method has been used to study the transmembrane topology of several proteins including the human P-glycoprotein (19Skach W.R. Lingappa V.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3202-3209Google Scholar, 20Skach W.R. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Google Scholar, 21Skach W.R. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar) has shown that models based on hydropathy analyses can be misleading and has resulted in the generation of novel topological profiles for these proteins. In this study the transmembrane topology of GAT-1 has been studied as a representative member of the Na+- and Cl−-dependent transporter family. While the data suggest that the transmembrane topology of GAT-1 HDs is not significantly different from that predicted by hydropathy analysis, the data show that the positioning of some extracellular loops may differ from the predicted model. Protease protection assay data has shown that residues in the loops connecting HD3 and HD4 and HD7 and HD8 of GAT-1-prolactin fusion proteins are accessible to protease in the cytoplasm. These residues may extend into a central pore from the extracellular face forming pore loop structures. These data also suggest that coordinate actions of several topogenic sequences are necessary for translocation and membrane integration of GAT-1. [3H]GABA was purchased from DuPont NEN. Restriction enzymes, Vent polymerase, and PNGase F were purchased from New England Biolabs. Taq polymerase was purchased from Promega. SDS-polyacrylamide gels, MultiMark protein standards, and Mark12 protein standards were from Novex. GAT-1 GABA transporter cDNA in pBluescript plasmid (pBSSKII(−)), generated as described previously (24Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Google Scholar), was digested with XhoI and XbaI and subcloned into plasmid JG3.6 (25Graminski G.F. Jayawickreme C.K. Potenza M.N. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5957-5964Google Scholar) for the wild-type construct (pGATA). Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a construct, pFLAGA-N in which the 5′-noncoding region of pGATA was replaced with aKpnI site followed by a consensus Kozak sequence, an ATG, sequence for the FLAG epitope tag, and nucleotides 4–20 of GAT-1. Amplification of GAT-1 with the FLAG oligonucleotide paired with an oligonucleotide directed to nucleotides 559–582 of the coding sequence yielded a fragment which was digested with KpnI andEcoRI and ligated into digested pGATA to create pFLAGA-N. pFLAGA-C, encoding GAT-1 with the FLAG epitope fused at the carboxyl terminus, was generated by amplification of GAT-1 with an oligo directed against nucleotides 1641–1671 paired with an oligo directed against nucleotides 1780–1797, sequence for the FLAG epitope, a TGA, and an XbaI site. The fragment was digested withXmaI and XbaI and ligated into digested pGATA. Truncated GAT-1 constructs were generated using polymerase chain reaction with an oligo containing a KpnI site and directed against the 5′-noncoding region (nucleotides −146 to −126) paired with oligos directed against defined regions in the GAT-1 coding sequence and containing a BstEII site (putative extracellular loop 1, EL1, 211–234; putative cytoplasmic loop 1, CL1, 319–339; EL2, 610–627; CL2, 694–711; EL3, 838–855; CL3, 937–954; EL4, 1094–1110; CL4, 1225–1242; EL5, 1348–1365; CL5, 1450–1467; EL6, 1579–1596; see Fig. 1, A and B). Polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with KpnI andBstEII and ligated into digested JGPRO. JGPRO was created by ligating an EcoRI/SphI fragment from pSPSp+1L.ST.gG.pT, obtained from W. R. Skach and V. R. Lingappa, into digested JG3.6 creating a vector bearing the prolactin epitope tag with a BstEII site engineered just prior to the sequence encoding the tag. PRO, a construct with full-length prolactin, was generated by ligation of a PstI and HindIII fragment from a prolactin construct (BPI) received from W. R. Skach and V. R. Lingappa into pBSSKII(−). Sequence analysis of constructs confirmed the absence of mutations introduced by polymerase chain reaction in all but two constructs, EL5 and CL5. In CL5 a single mutation of C to T (478 in the GAT-1 coding sequence) located in the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 results in a Pro to Ser change. A nonmutant CL5, ΔCL5, was generated by digesting pGATA and CL5 with EcoRI and AvrII and replacing the mutant fragment in CL5 with that from pGATA. Data obtained from proteinase K experiments with ΔCL5 were identical to those obtained with CL5. In EL5 a mutation of T to A (985 in the GAT-1 coding sequence) is located in HD7 and results in a Cys to Ser change, and a C to G (1131 in the GAT-1 coding sequence) is located in HD8 and results in an Ile to Met change. The T to A mutation in EL5 was corrected by digesting EL5 and CL4 with EcoRI and AvaI and replacing the mutant fragment in EL5 with that from CL4 generating ΔEL5. Data obtained from proteinase K experiments with ΔEL5 were identical to those obtained with EL5. Correction of the mutations in ΔCL5 and ΔEL5 was confirmed by sequencing of the constructs. Sequencing was performed by NAPCORE (Nucleic Acid/Protein Research Core Facility, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). mRNA was transcribed from the GAT-1 fusion protein constructs with 1 μg of linearized DNA using T7 RNA Polymerase according to the mMessage mMachine™ protocol (Ambion, Inc.). X.laevis were purchased from Xenopus (Ann Arbor, MI) and oocytes were dissected and prepared as described previously (26Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Pacholczyk T. Amara S.G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 860-871Google Scholar). 25 μCi of Trans35S-label (ICN Biomedicals Inc.) (0.25 μl of 10 × concentrated solution) was added to 1 μl of 250 ng/μl transcript and 50 nl of this solution injected per oocyte. Following incubation at 18 °C for 4–6 h, oocytes were pooled and homogenized on ice in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Following homogenization CaCl2 was added to 10 mm final concentration. Proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to aliquots of oocyte homogenates (0.2 mg/ml final) in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 1 h. Protease was inactivated by addition of 10 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) in Me2SO, dilution with 10 volumes of 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, and boiling for 5–10 min. Samples were diluted with 4 volumes of 1.25 × RIPA buffer (187.5 mm NaCl, 1.25% Triton X-100, 1.25% deoxycholate, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmEDTA, 0.125% SDS) and set at 4 °C with rocking ∼12–16 h. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and proteins immunoprecipitated from the supernatant as described below. Oocyte homogenates were extracted with sodium carbonate as described by Fujiki et al. (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Google Scholar) and Skach et al. (21Skach W.R. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23552-23561Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were diluted in 400 volumes in either 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, or 0.1m Tris, pH 7.5, and set on ice for 30 min. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm (230,000 × g) for 30 min using a 70.1 Ti rotor (Beckman). Proteins in the supernatants were precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid and pelleted. Trichloroacetic acid pellets and membrane pellets were dissolved in 1% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) and samples were boiled for 5–10 min. Following addition of 4 volumes of 1.25 × RIPA buffer, transporter-prolactin chimeras were immunoprecipitated as described below. Oocyte homogenates were denatured and peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase, 1000 units) or endoglycosidase H (Endo H, 2500 units) treatment performed at 37 °C for 1 h, according to the New England Biolabs protocol provided with the enzymes. Samples were solubilized in 1 × RIPA buffer, as described above, and subsequently immunoprecipitated. Fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ovine prolactin polyclonal serum (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) at 1:500 for 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A Affi-Gel (50 μl) (Bio-Rad) was added and samples were set at 4 °C for 3 h followed by 3 washes with 1 × RIPA buffer and 2 washes with 0.1m NaCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted from Protein A Affi-Gel in 2 × Laemmli buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) at 55 °C for 15 min. Samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and imaged on the Fujix PhosphorImaging system (Fuji). CV-1 cells were plated at a density of ∼2–3 × 105 cells per well in 24-well plates directly in the well or on 1.2-cm diameter coverslips. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/well using LipofectACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a ratio of 1:5 DNA/lipid (w/w). Cells were incubated with the DNA/lipid solution at 37 °C for 16–24 h at which time the medium was removed and replaced with complete medium. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were assayed for transport and immunocytochemistry was performed. Transfected cells were incubated with [3H]GABA (50 nm, 1 μCi/μl) in a modified Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (24Blakely R.D. Clark J.A. Rudnick G. Amara S.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 302-308Google Scholar) in the presence of 100 μmaminooxyacetic acid, a GABA transaminase inhibitor, for 30 min at 37 °C. Uptake was stopped by placing cells on ice and washing with ice-cold assay buffer. Cells were solubilized in 1% SDS, and the amount of accumulated [3H]GABA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. CV-1 cells transfected with pFLAGA-N or pFLAGA-C were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by incubation in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 3.3% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline) in the presence or absence of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated in blocking solution for 16 h prior to addition of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 1:300 in blocking solution. A 1-h incubation with primary antibody was followed by three 5-min washes with blocking solution. Incubation with Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Labs., Inc.), at 1:300–1:500 in blocking solution, was done for 1 h followed by three 5-min washes with blocking solution. Cells were then covered with coverslips after adding Slowfade™ reagent (Molecular Probes). Observation of the fluorescence staining was performed with a laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, LSM 410, at the Light Imaging Facility, NINDS, Bethesda, MD). To examine the transmembrane topology of the GAT-1 GABA transporter a series of constructs were generated in which the transporter sequence was truncated at the COOH-terminal region of each of the putative hydrophilic loops connecting the putative HDs (see Fig. 1 A). Each of the truncated transporter fragments were ligated into a vector (JGPRO) in-frame with the sequence for the carboxyl-terminal fragment of the secretory protein prolactin (codons 56–199). This prolactin fragment lacks intrinsic translocation activity and has previously been shown to serve as a faithful reporter for translocation when following topogenic sequences in chimeric proteins (17Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Google Scholar, 20Skach W.R. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6903-6908Google Scholar, 22Bennett J.A. Dingledine R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 373-384Google Scholar, 23Chavez R.A. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 385-393Google Scholar). GAT-1-prolactin chimeras are diagrammed in Fig. 1 B. Transcripts were made from the constructs and injected into X.laevisoocytes. Following incubation for 4–6 h, oocytes were homogenized. Endo H sensitivity, a reliable marker of protein residence in the ER membrane, was used to confirm chimera residence in the ER, and absence from the plasma membrane, at 4–6 h post-injection (data not shown). Because the chimeras have not exited the ER, it is evident that the membrane vesicles containing the chimeras display a single orientation. Furthermore, subcellular localization of GAT-1 expressed in oocytes as late as 2–5 days following transcript injection revealed that the vast majority of the transporter remained in intracellular compartments (29Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Brecha N. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14759-14767Google Scholar). Protease protection assays were used to determine the transmembrane spanning abilities of hydrophobic domains and the cellular location of regions connecting these domains. Nascent chains in the ER are oriented such that extracellular domains are located in the ER lumen and cytoplasmic domains are on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. Exposure of nascent chains in vesicles prepared from ER membranes to proteinase K, a protease that cleaves nonspecifically, results in cleavage of cytoplasmically exposed domains while domains in the ER lumen are protected. The data for study of the amino terminus and HD1 to HD6 are presented in Fig. 2, A-G. Proteinase K treatment of homogenates from oocytes expressing full-length prolactin shows that membrane vesicles in the homogenate are intact as prolactin is fully protected from the protease (Fig.2 A). The intensity of the protected prolactin band is nearly identical to the intensity of the prolactin control band (Fig.2 A), indicating that the majority of vesicles in theXenopus oocyte membrane homogenate are in the correct orientation. Prolactin is digested in the presence of proteinase K and a nonionic detergent (Fig. 2 A) indicating that prolactin is not protease-insensitive. A protease-resistant band of 14–15 kDa was detected for the full-length prolactin as well as each of the GAT-1-prolactin fusions tested. This fragment corresponds to the predicted size of the prolactin tag and is not indicative of a particular membrane orientation. The GAT-1-prolactin chimera extracellular loop 1, EL1, was protected from proteinase K digestion in the absence but not the presence of a nonionic detergent (Fig.2 B). These data strongly suggest that the first hydrophobic domain (HD1) has been translocated into the ER lumen but that HD1 has not yet integrated into the membrane (schematized in Fig.2 B) since the amino terminus also has been protected from digestion. Cytoplasmic loop 1, CL1, was partially digested by proteinase K as indicated by the reduced size of the protected fragment in Fig. 2 C (open arrow, lane 2). Comparison of the size of the untreated chimera with the protected fragment shows a difference of approximately 6 kDa. Partial digestion of CL1 indicates that HD1 has become associated with the membrane, and that a portion of CL1 slightly larger than the amino terminus has been digested. These data suggest that the amino terminus of CL1 is in the cytosol. No protected fragments were detected with EL2 (Fig. 2 D), the chimera with the prolactin tag fused at the COOH terminus of the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 and containing three canonical sites forN-linked glycosylation (Fig. 1 A). This finding was surprising as several groups have shown that the sites forN-linked glycosylation in this loop are utilized, and therefore that this loop is extracellular (10Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Google Scholar, 11Olivares L. Aragón C. Giménez C. Zafra F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9437-9442Google Scholar, 12Melikian H.E. McDonald J.K. Gu H. Rudnick G. Moore K.R. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12290-12297Google Scholar, 13Melikian H.E. Ramamoorthy S. Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 266-276Google Scholar). An 18-kDa fragment (approximately 2 kDa without the prolactin tag) was detected following protease treatment of CL2 (Fig. 2 E, open arrow, lane 2). The approximate point of digestion of CL2 based on gel mobility is the NH2-terminal side of HD4 suggesting that the COOH-terminal part of the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 extends into the membrane to the extent that it is accessible to protease. Protected fragments were detected following proteinase K treatment of EL3, whereas no protected fragments were detected following treatment of CL3 (Fig. 2,F and G). These data confirm that the loop connecting HD5 and HD6 is extracellular and that connecting HD6 and HD7 is intracellular as predicted by hydropathy analysis (Fig.1 A). The digested fragments from EL3 (Fig. 2 F, open arrows, lane 2) are 7 and 17 kDa smaller than the full-length chimera indicating that the approximate points of digestion were HD1 and the NH2-terminal side of the loop connecting HD3 and HD4, respectively. The inaccessibility of the loop connecting HD4 and HD5 to protease in chimera EL3 suggests that this chimera has assumed a conformation where this loop is buried and thus inaccessible to protease. The protease protection assay data showed that each of the GAT-1-prolactin chimeras was translocated across the ER membrane, but did not address the membrane integration abilities of these proteins. Polypeptides were extracted from membranes in 0.1 msodium carbonate, pH 11.5. Under these conditions peripheral membrane proteins and luminal polypeptides are extracted from the membranes while integral membrane proteins remain associated and readily sediment with the lipid bilayer (27Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Google Scholar). The secretory protein prolactin as well as EL1 are found in both the supernatant and pellet of Tris and carbonate-treated membranes (Fig. 3). In contrast, CL1 and CL2 are found in the Tris and carbonate pellets only (Fig. 3). EL2 and each of the remaining chimeras, EL3 through EL6 and CL3 through CL5, were found in the Tris and carbonate pellets following extraction (data not shown). The appearance of EL1 in the supernatant of the carbonate-extracted membranes confirms that HD1 has not completed integration into the membrane, while all of the chimeras with the exception of EL1 have integrated. The presence of prolactin and EL1 in the Tris supernatant is most likely due to lysis of some of the membrane vesicles in the procedure. The presence of some prolactin and EL1 in the carbonate pellet could be due to attachment of a portion of the nascent chains to ribosomes or to the presence of a fraction of sealed vesicles. The large loop between HD3 and HD4, containing sites forN-linked glycosylation, appears to be located in the cytosol based on data obtained in protease protection assays with EL2. If this loop is cytosolic then EL2 should not be glycosylated. To determine the glycosylation state of chimeras, homogenates were treated with PNGase F an enzyme that cleaves oligosaccharides between the innermostN-acetyl moiety and asparagine residues. Neither CL1, which has no potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, nor EL2 were affected by treatment with PNGase F (Fig. 4). In contrast, CL2 and EL3 (Fig. 4), and all remaining chimeras (data not shown), showed increased mobility on SDS-PAGE after treatment with PNGase F indicating that sugar moieties have been removed from these chimeras. These data indicate that a topogenic sequence in HD4, or in the loop connecting HD4 and HD5, is directing the extracellular orientation of the large loop connecting HD3 and HD4 such that it undergoes glycosylation. Taken together the PNGase F and protease protection data show that HD1 through HD6 attain a transmembrane orientation similar to that predicted by hydropathy analysis. However, these data point to potential differences in the membrane association of HD1 and the membrane association of the COOH-terminal region of the loop connecting HD3 and HD4. With the exception of EL4 and CL4, protease protection assays with chimeras designed to test loops connecting HD9 through HD12 yielded data consistent with the predicted topology for GAT-1. There were no detectable fragments on SDS-PAGE following proteinase K digestion of EL4 (Fig.5 A), suggesting a cytosolic placement for this loop. However, protease treatment of CL4 resulted in the protection of a fragment of approximately 20 kDa (4 kDa without the prolactin tag) (Fig. 5 B) indicating that HD7 has integrated into the membrane and that the COOH-terminal portion of the loop connecting HD7 and HD8 is accessible to protease. Proteinase K treatment of CL5 resulted in no detectable fragments (Fig.5 D) which suggests a cytosolic placement of the loop connecting HD10 and HD11. Several protected fragments were detected for both EL5 and EL6 (Fig. 5, C and E) suggesting that the nascent chain goes through various conformational states in acquiring the appropriate topology and as a result not all cytosolic loops are accessible to the protease. The sizes of the protected fragments reveal sites in the chimera which are accessible to protease. Protected fragments of 29, 27, and 21 kDa were detected for EL5 (Fig.5 C).

Stimulations by SAgs provoke drastic T-cell activation that leads to programmed cell death or the anergic state of responding cells. To characterize the signal transduction pathway initiated by SAgs, mutant lines derived from the human leukemic T-cell line Jurkat were tested for their reactivities against prototypic SAgs, staphylococcal enterotoxins. The J.CaM1.6 cell line, which lacks Lck expression and lost reactivity against T-cell antigen receptor-mediated stimulation, was activated by staphylococcal enterotoxins in a manner indistinguishable from the Jurkat cell line.

Another Src family protein-tyrosine kinase, Fyn, has also been implicated in playing a role in TCR signal transduction (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar,5Wange R.L.

CD45, a receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, also plays a critical role in TCR signal transduction (20Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev.

CD45 has been shownin vitro to up-regulate Src family protein-tyrosine kinases by dephosphorylating C terminus-negative regulatory tyrosine (23Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Impairment of the TCR signaling pathway in CD45-deficient cell lines appears to be due to the loss of function of certain populations of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (25Biffen M. McMichael-Phillips D. Larson T. Venkitaraman A. Alexandar D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1920-1929Google Scholar). To understand the unique characteristics of SAg-induced T-cell activation, we analyzed the signal transduction pathway triggered by staphylococcal enterotoxins using the leukemic T-cell line Jurkat and its mutant derivatives. The results demonstrate that Lck is not required for T-cell activation by SAgs. In the absence of Lck, Fyn was clearly activated by SAg stimulation. In addition, loss of CD45 severely impaired SAg-induced activation. This impairment was partly reconstituted by the expression of the active form of Fyn. Thus, in place of Lck, SAgs appear to utilize Fyn for initial events in the signal transduction pathway. Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 (26Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the active form of Fyn, wild-type Fyn (thymus form) cDNA (a gift from Dr. Roger Perlmutter, University of Washington, Seattle) was mutated at Tyr-525 to Phe using polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis as described (12Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Google Scholar). cDNA from the active form of Fyn was cloned into the pREP3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The Jurkat cell line and its mutant derivatives were transfected with the NF-AT/luciferase reporter construct as described (13Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Google Scholar). After transfection, each cell line was stimulated for 10 h with Raji cells pretreated with staphylococcal enterotoxin E or D (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL). Cells were harvested, and the activity of NF-AT from each transfectant was determined as described (13Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Google Scholar). The maximum response of each transfectant was determined by stimulation with 1.0 μm ionomycin (Calbiochem) and 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem). For experiments with Fyn.K394M and Fyn.Y525F, J.CaM1.6 and J.45.01 cells were transfected with the expression constructs (40 μg) 10 h prior to stimulation with staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE)-treated Raji cells. Normalization of the transfection efficiency was performed using the cytomegalovirus promotor-based LacZ expression vector (pCR3/LacZ, Invitrogen) and the β-galactosidase-based luminescence system (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Each experiment was performed more than once with either duplicate or triplicate samples, and the representative results are given. Cells (5 × 105) were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) in Hanks' balanced saline solution for 30 min at 37 °C and plated on a glass-bottom microwell dish (Mattek, Ashland, MA) coated with Cell-Tack (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA). To cells attached to the plate were added 1 × 105 Raji cells incubated with 10 ng/ml SEE (30 min at 37 °C in Hanks' balanced saline solution). The ratio of emitted fluorescence signals at 340 and 360 nm excitation (F340/F360) was monitored and analyzed as described (30Ogura A. Akita K. Kudo Y. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 9: 103-113Google Scholar) using a SIT camera (C2400-08, Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and the Argus 50/CA system (Hamamatsu Photonics). J.CaM1.6 cells (1 × 108) were combined with Raji cells (1 × 107) pretreated with 100 ng/ml SEE and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were harvested, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as described (31Irving B. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Google Scholar) with 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-ζ (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and anti-Fyn (Transduction Laboratories). Each sample was analyzed by Western blotting using 4G10 or anti-Fyn, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Zymed, Laboratories, Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and the ECL system (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). For in vitro kinase assay, J.CaM1.6 cells (1 × 107) were mixed with Raji cells (5 × 106) pretreated with or without 100 ng/ml SEE. After 20 min of incubation at 37 °C, cell lysates were prepared, and Fyn was immunoprecipitated. In vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (31Irving B. Weiss A. Cell. 1991; 64: 891-901Google Scholar). J.CaM1.6 and Jurkat cells (1 × 106) were stimulated with 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-P (Honen, Tokyo) or 100 ng/ml SEE and Raji cells (5 × 104) for 16 h. After wash with staining buffer (Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 5% calf serum and 0.02% sodium azide), cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-human CD69 (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in staining buffer. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Jurkat cells, which express Vβ8, were previously shown to respond strongly to staphylococcal enterotoxins A, D, and E presented by Raji cells, a leukemic B-cell line (32Herman A. Croteu G. Sekaly C.L. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 709-717Google Scholar). To analyze the detailed mechanism of T-cell activation by staphylococcal enterotoxins, NF-AT-dependent transcriptional activity was measured after stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment with SEE plus Raji cells strongly induced the NF-AT activity of Jurkat cells. Surprisingly, J.CaM1.6 cells, which are Lck-deficient (6Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar), showed equivalent reactivity against SEE compared with Jurkat cells. This activation by SEE is TCR-dependent since the TCR-negative Jurkat mutant, J.RT3.T3.5 (27Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Google Scholar), did not show any response. SED also activated J.CaM1.6 and Jurkat cells equally well (Fig. 1 B). There was no difference between Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells in reactivity against limited amounts of SEE (Fig.1 C). On the other hand, the anti-idiotypic antibody against Jurkat TCR, C305 (27Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Google Scholar), completely failed to activate J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 1 D). It should be noted that the CD45-deficient mutant, J.45.01 (28Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Google Scholar), showed a greatly reduced response to SEE (Fig.1 A). Superantigen stimulation, as well as other activation through TCR, results in several changes in the cell phenotype such as expression of surface antigens (33Hamel M.E. Eynoon E.E. Savelkoul H.F.J. van Oudenaren A. Kruisbeek A.M. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1065-1077Google Scholar). PHA is a strong T-cell mitogen and activates T-cells in a TCR-dependent manner (26Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Google Scholar). Treatment of Jurkat cells with PHA induced a high level of CD69 expression (Fig.2, upper left panel). In contrast, PHA stimulation of J.CaM1.6 cells resulted in minimum, if any, induction of CD69 expression. Treatment with C305 also resulted in induction of CD69 in Jurkat cells, but not in J.CaM1.6 cells (data not shown). On the contrary, SEE induced CD69 to the same level in Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 2, right panels). CD25 was also induced in both Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells by SEE (data not shown). In addition, programmed cell death was observed when J.CaM1.6 cells were cultured with SEE and Raji cells. 2M. Tachibana and M. Iwashima, unpublished observation. To further characterize the mechanism of SEE-induced T-cell activation, we investigated early signaling events that followed TCR engagement (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar,5Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Google Scholar). First, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells was determined. It was previously shown that anti-TCR antibody (C305) treatment results in no increase in Ca2+ in J.CaM1.6 cells (6Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar). To measure the increase in Ca2+ induced by SEE presented by Raji cells, microscopic fluorometric analysis was applied. Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells were compared at the single cell level with regard to the change in intracellular free Ca2+. As shown in Fig.3 A, both cell lines responded to SEE-treated Raji cells in an identical manner. An increase in Ca2+ was observed 10–15 min after the addition of Raji cells. Equivalent increases in Ca2+ levels were observed in both Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells. In addition,F340/F360 ratios were maintained at the maximum level over a 10-min period in both Jurkat and J.CaM1.6 cells. This demonstrates that SEE induces an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ in a manner distinctive from antibody-mediated stimulation. A comparison between the pseudo-colorF340/F360 ratio image and the bright-field image confirmed that cells that show an increase in Ca2+ colocalize with the cells forming de novocell-cell complexes, presumably composed of SEE-presenting Raji cells (identified as cells not showing any fluorescence) and J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 3 B). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is an essential step in TCR signal transduction. Lck plays a major role in phosphorylating two tyrosines in ITAMs, recruiting ZAP-70, and initiating downstream events (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 5Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Google Scholar,10Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Google Scholar, 11Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Google Scholar, 12Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Google Scholar, 13Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Google Scholar, 14Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Google Scholar, 15Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Google Scholar). Recruitment of ZAP-70 to the ζ chain by SED stimulation was previously described (34Chan A.C. Irving B.A. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Google Scholar). Thus, it was likely that staphylococcal enterotoxins activate T-cells through a pathway similar to that of antigenic stimulation via ITAM tyrosine phosphorylation and that a kinase other than Lck plays a major role in the process. As shown in Fig. 4 A (left panel), SEE stimulation induced tyrosine phosphorylation in various cellular proteins. Fyn, an Src family protein-tyrosine kinase that associates with the TCR complex, was previously indicated as playing a role in the TCR signal transduction pathway (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 5Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Google Scholar, 16Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4358-4362Google Scholar, 17Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Google Scholar, 18Appleby M.W. Gross J.A. Cooke M.P. Levin S.D. Qian X. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 751-763Google Scholar, 19Stein P.L. Lee H.-M. Rich S. Soriano P. Cell. 1992; 70: 741-750Google Scholar). An increase in tyrosine phosphorylation on Fyn and the ζ chain was confirmed (Fig.4 A, upperand middle right panels). An equivalent amount of the ζ chain (data not shown) and Fyn was detected in the immunoprecipitates from unstimulated and stimulated J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 4 A, lower right panel). Moreover, the in vitro kinase assay of anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates showed strongly induced kinase activity in SEE-activated J.CaM1.6 cells (Fig. 4 B). The functional role of Fyn was further tested by expressing the kinase-inactive form, Fyn.K299M (17Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Google Scholar), in J.CaM1.6 cells. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the expression of Fyn.K299M in J.CaM1.6 cells significantly suppressed NF-AT activation induced by differing doses of SEE. This shows that Fyn.K299M functions in a dominant-negative manner in the signal transduction pathway activated by SEE. The role of Fyn was also tested using J.45.01 cells. Previously, it was shown that the loss of CD45 expression leads to greatly impaired reactivity of T-cells to anti-TCR antibody stimulation (20Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Google Scholar, 21Alexander D. Shiroo M. Robinson A. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 477-482Google Scholar, 22Penninger J.M. Wallace V.A. Kishihara K. Mak T.W. Immunol. Rev. 1993; 135: 183-214Google Scholar). Loss of CD45 expression in T-cells was associated with the increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyr-505 in Lck and Fyn (35Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Google Scholar, 36Sieh M. Bolen J.B. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 315-321Google Scholar, 37Burns C.M. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13594-13600Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the reactivity of J.45.01 cells against SEE is also severely impaired (Fig. 1 A). When the active form of Fyn (Tyr-528 to Phe mutation in Fyn) was expressed in J.45.01 cells, NF-AT activation by SEE was enhanced to a level equivalent to that in Jurkat cells (Fig. 4 B; also see Fig.1). In contrast, no enhancement was observed when wild-type Fyn was expressed, indicating that Tyr-528 of Fyn plays a critical function in relation to the function of CD45. Our results presented here demonstrate that SAgs activate T-cells in an Lck-independent manner and that Fyn may play a critical role in the signaling process. Two other reports support this. Migita et al. (38Migita K. Eguchi K. Kawabe Y. Nagataki S. Immunology. 1995; 85: 550-555Google Scholar) demonstrated that staphylococcal enterotoxin B activates Fyn, but not Lck, in mouse splenic T-cells in vivo. In Fyn knockout mice, the proliferative response of splenocytes to staphylococcal enterotoxin B was substantially impaired (17Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Google Scholar). There are at least two roles that Lck plays in the TCR signal transduction pathway (4Weiss A. Littman D.R.. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 5Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Google Scholar, 10Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Google Scholar, 11Wange R.L. Malek S.N. Desiderio S. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19797-19801Google Scholar, 12Iwashima M. Irving B.A. van Oers N.S.C. Chan A.C. Weiss A. Science. 1994; 263: 1136-1139Google Scholar, 13Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Google Scholar, 14Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.-H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Google Scholar, 15Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18730-18733Google Scholar). One is tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs in the TCR complex to create binding sites for ZAP-70, and the other is activation of ZAP-70 by tyrosine phosphorylation. It was previously demonstrated in a heterologous system using COS cells that Fyn and Lck induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs and activation of ZAP-70 at an equivalent efficiency (10Chan A.C. Iwashima M. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 71: 649-662Google Scholar). Fyn was found in association with the ζ chain (16Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F. Luong E.T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4358-4362Google Scholar), and the overexpression of Fyn induces hyperactivity of antigen-specific T-cells (17Fusaki N. Semba K. Katagiri T. Suzuki G. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1245-1255Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that SAg stimulation leads to activation of Fyn in the absence of Lck and initiates the signaling process. Recent reports also indicate the functional redundancy of Fyn and Lck in T-cell development (39Groves T. Smiley P. Cooke M.P. Forbush K. Perlmutter R.M. Guidos C.J. Immunity. 1996; 5: 417-428Google Scholar, 40van Oers N.S.C. Lowin-Kropf B. Finlay D. Connolly K. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 429-436Google Scholar). It is still unclear, however, why SAgs, but not other TCR stimulators, activate T-cells independently of Lck. This is not due to the strength of SAg-induced activation since limited amounts of SEE activated J.CaM1.6 cells in an identical manner to Jurkat cells, whereas anti-TCR antibody and PHA completely failed to activate J.CaM1.6 cells. Thus, the differences between SAg stimulation and other stimulation derive from the qualitative differences in the manner in which TCR is triggered. One possibility is that the activation by SAgs involves a T-cell surface molecule other than TCR. Such a coreceptor could function in activating Fyn only in case of SAg stimulation. Another possibility is that SAgs induce a unique conformational change in the TCR complex so that Fyn can be activated. Recently, the crystal structure of a complex between the β chain of TCR and staphylococcal enterotoxin B was reported (41Field B. Malchiodi E.L. Li H. Ysern X. Stauffacher C.V. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 188-192Google Scholar). The complex formed by SAg with TCR is distinctive in structure from the complex formed by TCR with the MHC+ peptides (42Garboczi D.N. Ghosh P. Utz U. Fan Q.R. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 134-141Google Scholar). In addition, antibody treatment of the CD3 ε chain induced Syk activation and a Ca2+ increase in J.CaM1.6 cells (26Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6879-6883Google Scholar, 43Couture C. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5301-5305Google Scholar). Thus, Fyn may be activated by the structural alteration within the TCR complex by SAg stimulation. Finally, the biological responses that are unique to SAg activation may be contributed by the involvement of Fyn in its signal transduction process. A difference in the substrate specificity of Lck and Fyn is a factor that could contribute to the biological consequences. In addition, we have recently shown that the SH2 and SH3 domains of Lck play critical roles in T-cell activation initiated by membrane-localized ZAP-70 (13Yamasaki S. Takamatsu M. Iwashima M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7151-7160Google Scholar). It is likely that the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn also play roles in the signaling process initiated by SAg stimulation. These domains of Lck and Fyn may have different repertoires of targets in vivo (44Pawson T. Nature. 1994; 373: 573-580Google Scholar). This implies that there can be differing molecules that are involved in the distal events of the signal transduction pathway when Fyn instead of Lck is involved. In such cases, the molecules associated specifically with the SH2 and SH3 domains of Fyn could contribute to the unique biological consequences provoked by SAg stimulation.

Comparison of the in vivo targets for RegA to the SELEX-generated consensus suggests a repression pattern whereby the translation of individual messages is sequentially halted until the least similarly affected message, theregA gene itself, is repressed. Translational regulation has been shown to be an important means for controlling gene expression in a variety of organisms, both prokaryotic (1Gold L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 199-233Google Scholar, 2McCarthy J.E. Gualerzi C. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 78-85Google Scholar) and eukaryotic (3Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 78: 197-225Google Scholar, 4Standart N. Jackson R.J. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1994; 76: 867-879Google Scholar). One of the more interesting regulatory mechanisms involves the repression of translation caused by RNA-binding proteins interacting specifically with mRNAs. Many of these translational repressors function by directly competing for mRNA binding with ribosomes, thus decreasing the level of translational initiation (5Campbell K.M. Stormo G.D. Gold L. Beckwith J. Davies J. Gallant J.A. Gene Function in Prokaryotes. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1983: 185-210Google Scholar). Among the well characterized repressors, the bacteriophage T4 translational repressor, RegA, is unusual in that it affects the translation of many independent messages. The expression of at least nine T4 genes is reduced in the latter stages of the phage life cycle by the autoregulated product of theregA gene (6Wiberg J.S. Karam J.D. Mathews C.K. Kutter E.M. Mosig G. Berget P.B. The Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1983: 193-201Google Scholar). Transcription of these genes is not altered, and thus RegA-mediated repression occurs post-transcriptionally (7Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 538-549Google Scholar). Genetic analysis and in vitro footprinting indicate that RegA specifically interacts with several of the regulated mRNAs near their translational start sites (8Karam J. Gold L. Singer B.S. Dawson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4669-4673Google Scholar, 9Winter R.B. Morrissey L. Gauss P. Gold L. Hsu T. Karam J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7822-7826Google Scholar, 10Webster K.R. Adari H.Y. Spicer E.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10047-10056Google Scholar). The presence of RegA alters the binding of the 30 S subunit of Escherichia coliribosomes to these mRNAs, thus preventing translational initiation (9Winter R.B. Morrissey L. Gauss P. Gold L. Hsu T. Karam J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7822-7826Google Scholar). Taken together, these data are consistent with RegA altering gene expression in vivo by obstructing ribosome binding to specific mRNAs. Although RegA repression is specific, the mRNA sequences that are bound by the repressor display few similarities. A consensus for the region surrounding the translational start sites of the affected mRNAs is indistinguishable from one generated for all of the known T4 messages (11Unnithan S. Green L. Morrissey L. Binkley J. Singer B. Karam J. Gold L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7083-7092Google Scholar). The lack of a distinctive consensus for the RegA-bound RNAs is not terribly surprising given that the putative repressor-binding site lies within the RNA domain used for translational initiation. Elements such as the AUG start codon and Shine-Dalgarno sequence are apparent in all of the messages of T4; thus repressed and unrepressed messages will necessarily share these characteristics within the RegA binding domain. However, it has been shown that single-site substitutions in this region of the affected messages can reduce RegA binding by more than 2 orders of magnitude (12Webster K.R. Spicer E.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19007-19014Google Scholar). In addition, NMR studies of an RNA fragment harboring a G → U substitution in the same region indicate that both the native and mutated RNAs have similar single-stranded conformations (13Szewczak A.A. Webster K.R. Spicer E.K. Moore P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17832-17837Google Scholar). Results from mutational (14O'Malley S.M. Sattar A.K.M. Williams K.R. Spicer E.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 26097-26103Google Scholar) suggest that the C terminus of T4 RegA protein provides the nonspecific nucleic acid binding component but the ability to discriminate between sequences resides elsewhere on the protein. An understanding of the RNA elements required for binding by RegA would best be achieved by separating repressor binding from the in vivo requirements for translation. We used SELEX 1The abbreviations used are:SELEXsystematic evolution of ligands byexponential enrichment;PCRolymerase chain reaction;CMCT1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate;kethoxal2-keto-3-ethoxy-N-butyraldehyde.

Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Google Scholar), an in vitro method for isolating RNAs from a random sequence population that has the highest affinity for a target protein, to identify the RNA components required for RegA binding without the requisite need for translation. Fifteen rounds of selection yielded a clear consensus. Surprisingly, the consensus was not a structural motif as is generally the case for RNA-binding proteins; rather the consensus was a specific sequence. Results reported here led us to propose that RegA recognizes its targets in a sequence-preferred structure-independent manner. systematic evolution of ligands byexponential enrichment; olymerase chain reaction; 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate; 2-keto-3-ethoxy-N-butyraldehyde. The RegA protein was purified as described (17Kang C. Chan R. Berger I. Lockshin C. Green L. Gold L. Rich A. Science. 1995; 268: 1170-1173Google Scholar). A nucleic acid library possessing 5′ and 3′ fixed regions surrounding a 30-nucleotide randomized region was generated as described (18Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14765-14774Google Scholar). 1015 RNA molecules comprising approximately 1014 unique sequences were incubated in 100 μl of RegA buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 μm RegA for 5 min at 25 °C. The binding reactions were applied to nitrocellulose filters, which preferentially retain RNAs that are bound to protein, and the filters were washed with 10 ml of RegA buffer. The protein-bound RNA was extracted from the protein/filter as described (19Chen H. Brown D. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 275Google Scholar). The RNA was reverse-transcribed using the 3′ primer 3G1 (GCC GGA TCC GGG CCT CAT GTC GAA), and PCR amplification was carried out using both 3G1 and the 5′ primer 5G1 (CCG AAG CTT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GAG CTC AGA ATA AAC GCT CAA). The resulting PCR product was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (20Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Google Scholar). The RNA was gel-purified (19Chen H. Brown D. Gold L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 275Google Scholar) and used in the subsequent round of RegA binding. This process was continued with decreasing amounts of RegA (to increase selection stringency) for 15 cycles. The round 15 PCR product was restricted with HindIII and BamHI and ligated into similar sites of pUC 18, and the resulting plasmids were used to transform DH5α as described (21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.P. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Clonal inserts were sequenced using standard methods. Dissociation constants for the interactions between RegA and various ligands were determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (22Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Google Scholar). 50 pmRNA that had been 5′ end-labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase was incubated with various concentrations of RegA (0.1 nm–1 μm) in 10 μl of RegA buffer at 25 °C for 5 min. The bound and unbound RNAs were separated by electrophoresis through a non-denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel. For the quantitative Kd analysis shown in Table I, the relative amounts of bound and unbound RNA in each lane were quantified by scintillation counting of appropriate bands.Table IBinding affinity of selected RNA sequences for RegAPutative binding siteDissociation constantnmAAAAUUGUUAUGUAA5 ± 1AAAAUUAUUAUGUAA5 ± 1AAAAUUGUUAUGGAA5 ± 1AAAAUUGUUAUGAAA6 ± 2AAAAUUGUGAUGUAA8 ± 1AAAAUUGGUAUGUAA12 ± 3AAAAUGGUGAUGAAA11 ± 2AAAAUUGUUAUGAAC24 ± 8AAAAUGGUGAUGAGA24 ± 5AAGAUUGCAAUGGAA40 ± 10AAAAAUAAAAUGAAA∼200The sequence of the putative binding site, which is in the context of the 3′-disrupted flanking regions (see Fig. 3), is displayed in the left-hand column.

Nucleotides that vary from the consensus are underlined. Dissociation constants of the RNA ligands are shown to the right of each sequence. The minimal 5′ sequence required for the binding of RegA was determined basically as described (23Tuerk C. Eddy S. Parma D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 749-761Google Scholar). Five picomoles of partially hydrolyzed 5′ end-labeled RNA was incubated with 5 or 15 nm RegA in 500 μl of RegA buffer at 25 °C for 5 min. The RegA-bound RNA fragments were separated from the unbound fragments by nitrocellulose filter binding. Bound RNAs were extracted as above and size-separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Partial RNase T1 digests were performed as described (23Tuerk C. Eddy S. Parma D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 749-761Google Scholar). RNAs were chemically modified using 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate CMCT, kethoxal (2-keto-3-ethoxy-N-butyraldehyde), and dimethyl sulfate as described (24Stern S. Moazed D. Noller H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 164: 481-489Google Scholar) with a few exceptions. Each modification reaction contained 15 pmol of RNA in 50 μl. The modification reactions were stopped and reverse-transcribed as described (25Binkley J. Allen P. Brown D. Green L. Tuerk C. Gold L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 16: 3198-3205Google Scholar). In addition, RNAs were partially digested with either ribonuclease S1 (0.2 units/reaction), T1 (0.2 units/reaction), or ribonuclease A (0.1 μg/ml). Enzymatic digestions were carried out with 4 pmol of RNA/10-μl reaction at 25 °C for 1 min. For footprinting experiments, RegA and RNA were incubated together in binding buffer at 25 °C for 7 min before adding RNase for 1 min. An oligonucleotide of sequence 5′-CCGGGCCTTTTGTCGAATT-3′ was used in PCR reactions along with the 5′ primer used in the selection and DNA preparations of the various clones to provide a template whose transcription product possessed a disrupted 3′-RegA-binding site. The RNAs were internally labeled by including [α-32P]UTP in the transcription reactions. Translational repression of several early T4 genes results from the binding of the regA gene product to specific mRNAs near their respective AUG start codons, preventing the initiation of translation (9Winter R.B. Morrissey L. Gauss P. Gold L. Hsu T. Karam J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7822-7826Google Scholar). Although the sequences and putative RegA-binding sites of several of these mRNAs are known, a shared primary or secondary structure is not obvious (11Unnithan S. Green L. Morrissey L. Binkley J. Singer B. Karam J. Gold L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7083-7092Google Scholar). SELEX was used to uncover the binding site specificity of RegA. Fifteen cycles of repressor binding, partitioning, and amplification of selected sequences reduced the dissociation constant of the RNA population for RegA from approximately 10 μm to 20 nm (data not shown). The round 15 population was cloned, and 24 of the clones were sequenced. Within the 30-nucleotide variable region of the selected ligands are two highly conserved domains, one covering the 13 5′ nucleotides and the second covering the 4 3′ nucleotides (Fig. 1). The 5′ consensus sequence, AAUUGUUAUGUAA, possesses what we believe is the AUG start codon observed in all of the native mRNA targets of RegA. The 3′ consensus of AAAA is interesting when the 3′ fixed region of UUCGACAUG is taken into account. The resulting sequence of AAAAUUCGACAUG compares favorably with the 5′ consensus of AAAAUUGUUAUGUAA, where the first two As in the latter sequence are provided by the 5′ fixed region. The similarities between the two independent sites within the selected RNAs suggest the existence of two binding sites for RegA on each molecule. Because the putative 5′-binding site is made up almost entirely of nucleotides that were selected from the variable region, the relative conservation of each of the positions is quite telling as to the nature of the RegA binding interaction. The AUG is absolutely conserved among the ligands, suggesting that it is the primary effector of binding affinity. The poly(A) tract is also highly conserved, with its apparent optimum position being five nucleotides upstream of the AUG. The UU immediately following the upstream poly(A) tract and the AA following the AUG are also present in >90% of the ligands. The remaining positions are less conserved, although the level of conservation of these sequences within the putative binding domain is still quite high (>75%). Binding affinities between RegA and specific ligands were measured using a gel mobility shift assay. The two sequences that occurred in multiple clones were PCR-amplified from plasmid DNA, transcribed, and radiolabeled. These two ligands were incubated with a range of RegA concentrations, and the bound and unbound RNAs were separated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein binding, as witnessed by a mobility shift, was first observed in the low nm range for both ligands, with their dissociation constants occurring at approximately 5 nm (Fig.2,A and C). At RegA concentrations of approximately 20 nm, a third, slower migrating band was apparent (Fig. 2, A and C). All of the label shifted to this region of the gel at the highest concentration of protein. A simple explanation for these results is that a single binding event occurs at lower RegA concentrations and that an additional protein binds to each ligand at higher concentrations yielding the second shift. This is consistent with the sequence analysis above that suggests that two RegA-binding sites exist on each of these RNAs. The AUG of the putative second binding site was altered to UUU, and the 10 3′-most nucleotides were removed to test whether a single binding event could be observed. The modified ligands produced only a single shift (Fig. 2, B and D) and displayed affinities for RegA that were the same as the full-length molecules from which they were derived. These findings are consistent with there being two independent RegA-binding sites associated with each of the two ligands. The 5′-binding sites of the two RNAs are apparently the higher affinity sites, with dissociation constants for RegA of approximately 5 nm. Although the sequence data suggest a relative size of the RegA-binding site based on the region of greatest homology, a physical measure of the minimal domain required for high affinity binding to the protein was acquired using the boundary assay (23Tuerk C. Eddy S. Parma D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 749-761Google Scholar). Each of the four RNAs described in the binding experiments above were 5′ end-labeled and subjected to partial alkaline hydrolysis. The resulting RNA fragments were bound to RegA and passed through nitrocellulose filters. The fragments that still possessed the protein-binding site were preferentially retained on the filters. The recovered RNA fragments were characterized via polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3). The two full-length RNAs yielded two distinctive boundaries, the more efficiently retained occurring up to the AUG of the putative 3′-RegA-binding site and a second boundary occurring at the 3′ end of the UAA of the putative 5′-binding site. These data are consistent with there being two independent binding sites. The presence of two binding sites could either increase the relative affinity of the RNA for protein or increase the efficiency of filter retention by increasing the amount of protein bound per RNA, thus enhancing the percentage of fragments being retained during partitioning. There is binding after the 3′ site is disrupted so long as the 5′ site is maintained, but once the fragments lose nucleotides at the 3′ end of the proposed 5′-binding site, filter retention is lost altogether. The RNAs with the 3′ site disruptions displayed only a single boundary at the 3′ end of the predicted 5′-binding site (Fig. 3). Partial nuclease digests of the full-length and 3′ site-disrupted versions of ligand A indicated that most of the nucleotides were sensitive to the single-strand-specific RNases (Fig. 4). The addition of two concentrations of RegA to the various RNA/RNase reactions resulted in the protection of specific bases from nuclease attack. Complete protection of the bases between positions A22 and A35 of both ligands was observed at 100 and 500 nm RegA (Figs. 4 A and 3 B). These RegA-induced protections span the putative 5′-binding sites of the two RNAs. Bases between A35 and U42 show either equivalent or enhanced nuclease activity in the presence of RegA. Most of the bases between positions G44 and U59 in the full-length version of ligand A are completely protected from nuclease attack by both concentrations of repressor (Fig. 4 A). This second RegA footprint covers the putative 3′-binding site of the RNA. Except for positions U48 and U58, which are partially protected by 500 nmRegA, the corresponding bases in the 3′ site-disrupted version of ligand A are accessible to the nucleases in the presence or absence of RegA (Fig. 4 B). The loss of the footprint at the 3′ end of the second ligand is once again consistent with the assertion that two RegA binding events occur on the full-length ligands and that binding at the 3′ site is dependent on there being an AUG. The apparent lack of RNA secondary structure observed in the nuclease digestions was investigated further using several single-strand-specific base-modifying reagents. The nucleotides making up the putative RegA-binding sites for ligands A and B were completely sensitive to the reagents (Figs. 5 A and4 B). In fact, very few of the bases in the entire RNAs escaped modification, indicating that the ligands were devoid of structures that rely on Watson-Crick base pairing. These data suggest that RegA interacts with its RNA-binding sites in a structure-independent manner, a property that is unlike the well characterized RNA-binding proteins. Because none of the mRNAs affected by RegA in vivopossess the SELEX-generated consensus sequence, it was of interest to understand the relative effect that alterations from the consensus have on RegA binding affinity. Using RNAs whose 3′-binding site had been disrupted as above, the consensus sequence and several variants were tested for RegA binding. As seen in Table I, the UUGUU region 5′ to the AUG and the UAA 3′ to the AUG can undergo single base changes with little effect on binding. Thus the binding data are consistent with the sequence data that indicated that these two domains are important, but not essential, for RegA binding. Mutations in the AUG probably have a much greater effect as witnessed by the apparent loss of RegA binding caused by mutating the AUG of the 3′-binding site to UUU (Fig. 2). In contrast to the slight effect that single base changes have on RegA binding, multiple changes cause more significant decreases in affinity (Table I). This suggests that multiple mutations in this conserved region may have an additive effect on the interaction, which can have a profound consequence on the binding affinity of the site. The T4-encoded RegA is one of the few known proteins that regulates the translation of multiple transcripts (26Miller E.S. Karam J.D. Spicer E.K. Karam J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 193-295Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the protein discriminates between messages has remained a mystery, as the makeup of the start sites of the affected mRNAs are not statistically unlike those that are unaffected (11Unnithan S. Green L. Morrissey L. Binkley J. Singer B. Karam J. Gold L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7083-7092Google Scholar). Using the SELEX protocol, a set of RNAs were generated that possessed high affinity for RegA. Characterization of these ligands indicates that the RegA consensus binding site is AAAAUUGUUAUGUAA. Stable secondary structures that rely on canonical base pairs do not exist for the consensus, suggesting that RegA discriminates between RNAs based on primary sequence rather than secondary structure. The absence of Watson-Crick base pairing in the RNA binding domain of the SELEX ligands is supported by chemical modification and nuclease digestion results. A lack of secondary structure potential has likewise been observed in the in vivo binding sites for the protein (27Miller E.S. Karam J. Dawson M. Trojanowska M. Gauss P. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 397-410Google Scholar). The consensus sequence suggests that the relative site of interaction between RegA and the affected mRNAs includes the first two codons of the message plus the nine nucleotides immediately upstream. The sequences of the T4 mRNAs that are known to be regulated by RegA were compared with the SELEX-generated consensus using the AUG start codon for alignment. In addition to the AUG, most of the RNAs possess a UU 5′ to the translational start site and a poly(A) tract two to eight nucleotides upstream (Fig. 6). Although these features are not at fixed distances from the AUG, their presence is suggestive of similar interactions between substrate and repressor. Interestingly, the mRNAs display varying degrees of similarity to the consensus binding site, with the regA gene itself being the least similar. If the binding affinity of RegA for the mRNAs correlates with their similarity to the consensus, then the translation of the various genes would be halted successively until theregA gene was repressed. All mRNAs that were less similar to the consensus than the regA gene would not be repressed, as the concentration of RegA would be held below a threshold level that was a function of the binding affinity of the RegA-binding site of the regA gene. The SELEX-generated consensus sequence has a stop codon following the AUG start in the RegA-binding site; thus, the highest affinity site for RegA could not exist within an mRNA that encodes a polypeptide. Why would a translational repressor be selected with such an RNA-binding site? A possible explanation could be that mRNA binding is actually a secondary function and that RegA is optimized to bind a cellular RNA. The T4 genome was searched for sequences that match the consensus. No exact matches of the consensus RegA-binding site were found, but several sites with properly aligned sequences (upstream poly(A), U/G tract, AUG, and UAA) were uncovered. One of the most similar sequences was AAAAAUAUUAUGUAA, which is located within the dam gene (28Macdonald P.M. Mosig G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2863-2871Google Scholar). This region of the T4 genome has been heavily studied because it supports T4-dependent replication. Current opinion holds that the region is transcribed by the host RNA polymerase, giving rise to an RNA that primes T4 replication. If a transcript is produced from this region of the T4 genome, then the high affinity site for RegA actually exists in vivo during a time that RegA is produced (29Cardillo T.S. Landry E.F. Wiberg J.S. J. Virol. 1979; 32: 905-916Google Scholar, 30Campbell K. Gold L. Grunberg-Manago M. Safer B. Interaction of Translational and Transcriptional Controls in the Regulation of Gene Expression. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1982: 69-81Google Scholar). It is postulated that RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions involving RegA localize the various components of the T4 replisome to origins of replication. The presence of a potentially high affinity RegA-binding site within a T4 genomic domain associated with a replication origin is intriguing, as it provides a possible mechanism for localizing replisome assembly within the cell to a region where replication is initiated.

Metabolic labeling studies in fibroblasts from two subjects harboring the benign mutation C739T showed that the α-subunit protein was processed to its mature lysosomal size (13Thomas G.H. Raghavan S.

Although this analysis was not quantitative, the protein level was consistent with that which might be expected in a Tay-Sachs disease heterozygote. Some investigators proposed that the enzyme's capacity to hydrolyze the synthetic, but not the natural, substrate was reduced (10Kelly T.E. Reynolds L.W. O'Brien J.S. Clin.

Others suggested that there was a reduction in the activity of the enzyme toward both synthetic and natural substrates and that a differential tissue distribution accounted for the very low serum levels (13Thomas G.H. Raghavan S. Kolodny E.H. Frisch A. Neufeld E.F. O'Brien J.S. Reynolds L.W. Miller C.S. Shapiro J. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Heller R.H. Pediatr. Res. 1982; 16: 232-237Google Scholar, 14Grebner E.E.

Hex S was expressed and analyzed in this study because it is an α-subunit dimer, and if the benign mutation was present on both of the subunits in Hex S, their effects might be more obvious than on Hex A (αβ). Hex A was also expressed to mimic the physiological form of the enzyme.Analysis of Expressed Hex S Activity and α-Subunit ProteinTo determine the effects of the benign mutations on the activity of Hex S and the α-subunit protein level, normal and mutant Hex S was expressed in COS-7 cells. Four mutant vectors, containing C739T(R247W), C745T(R249W), G805A(G269S), or C508T(R170W) mutations associated with Hex A pseudodeficiency (two vectors), adult onset and infantile forms of GM2 gangliosidosis, respectively, were expressed. The results showed that normal Hex S activity (1026 ± 200 nmol/h/mg of protein) was expressed to a level more than 10 times that of the β-hexosaminidase activity in COS-7 cells (82 ± 10 nmol/h/mg of protein). For comparison, the wild-type Hex S activity, after subtracting the COS-7 cell background and normalization, was expressed as 100%. The activities of the various mutant Hex S isozymes were converted to a percentage of the wild-type (Fig. 1). Data revealed that the activity of Hex S harboring the benign mutations, R247W and R249W, was about 20–35% of the wild-type Hex S activity and was substantially higher than that of Hex S containing the G269S substitution that is associated with adult onset GM2 gangliosidosis.The level of the mature α-subunit protein containing the benign mutations was also decreased to about 40% of the normal level (Fig.2), consistent with its reduced enzyme activity. No detectable mature form, but a normal level of the precursor form, of the α-subunit corresponding to the G269S- and R170W-containing Hex S was observed.Figure 2Levels of expressed α-subunit protein containing the benign and disease-causing mutations. The α-subunit cDNA and its various mutant derivatives were transfected alone to express Hex S (A) or together with the β-subunit to express Hex A plus S (B and C). The amount of protein loaded for each sample within a panel (A and B, 20–30 μg; C, 5–10 μg) was normalized to the co-expressed β-galactosidase activity, with the exception of the mock (25–30 μg) and fibroblast (30–50 μg) samples.

Once again, the specific activity of the expressed normal Hex A plus S was about 10-fold above the COS-7 cell background (Fig. 1). The specific activity of Hex A plus S harboring the benign mutation, R247W and R249W, was about 38 and 22% of that of the normal Hex A plus S, respectively (Fig. 1). Hex A plus S with the adult onset disease G269S mutation in the α-subunit had about 11% of the normal level of activity, significantly less than either benign mutation. The activity of Hex A plus S containing the G749A(G250D) mutation was less than 4% of the normal, consistent with a juvenile onset clinical phenotype (43Hechtman P. Boulay B. Bayleran J. Andermann E. Clin. Genet. 1989; 35: 364-375Google Scholar). The Tay-Sachs disease mutation R170W expressed a specific activity similar to the COS-7 cell background (Fig. 1).The levels of the mature α-subunit protein expressed as Hex A plus S were also correspondingly decreased by the benign mutations (Fig. 2,B and C), but the level of the precursor α-subunit containing the benign mutations was similar to that of the normal. The mature α-subunit was not detected in the extracts prepared from expression of disease-causing mutations, although a significant amount of the precursor was detected. The differences between the benign mutations and disease-causing mutations appeared more obvious at the level of the mature α-subunit protein than at the activity level.The co-transfection of pCD43 and αpSVL in COS-7 cells under the conditions used in these studies (see “Experimental Procedures”) resulted in the formation of both Hex A and Hex S; Hex A was predominant, although there was a significant level of Hex S produced (Fig. 3). Anion exchange chromatography showed that Hex A was formed when the β-subunit was co-expressed with the α-subunit carrying the benign mutations (data not shown).Figure 3Separation of the β-hexosaminidase isoenzyme forms Hex A, Hex B, and Hex S by anion exchange chromatography. Cell extract (1.7 mg of protein) prepared from α-/β-subunit cDNA co-transfected COS-7 cells was loaded onto a DEAE-cellulose column (1.4-ml bed volume), that had been equilibrated with 10 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and the column was eluted with a linear and then step gradient of NaCl extending to 0.5 m NaCl. The linear NaCl gradient is shown as ▵–·–▵. Start points for the steps of the gradient are denoted by a down arrow, the number at the top of the arrow indicates the molar concentration of NaCl. Column fractions representing each peak of activity (numbered 1–4) were pooled and concentrated; ∼20 μg of fractions 1 and 2 and ∼40 μg of fractions 3 and 4 were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis to determine the identity of the peaks using the anti-Hex A antibody.

When transfection efficiency was low, higher levels of both β-hexosaminidase activity and α-subunit protein were expressed from mutant vectors in comparison with the normal vector. In Fig. 2 B, expressed levels of α-subunit protein were higher than those in Fig.2 C, where the transfection efficiency was higher.Analysis of Hex A in Cultured FibroblastsThe Hex A activity and the α-subunit protein in fibroblasts from Hex A pseudodeficient subjects were compared with that from the normal. Hex A-pseudodeficient fibroblasts had 36–41% of normal Hex A activity (TableI) and a comparable level of mature α-subunit protein (data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies where pseudodeficient fibroblasts had Hex A activity that was 23–26% of the total β-hexosaminidase activity compared with 49–65% of Hex A for the normal (13Thomas G.H.

Leupeptin, a lysosomal protease inhibitor at 200 μm (44Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Google Scholar) did not increase the percentage of the specific activity of Hex A (Table I) or the level of mature α-subunit protein (data not shown) in either the normal or mutant fibroblasts.Table Iβ-Hexosaminidase A activity in cultured fibroblast cellsMCH065TC72GM04863WG1881GM00294−Leupeptin1-a± leupeptin indicates the presence (+) or absence (−) of leupeptin in the cell culture medium.332 ± 64120 ± 16137 ± 1913 ± 343 ± 3Percentage1-bHex A activities of the Hex A pseudodeficient cell lines, TC72 and GM04863, a Tay-Sachs disease cell line WG1881, and a Sandhoff disease cell line, GM00294, are presented as a percentage of the activity of a normal fibroblast cell line MCH065 (100%).1003641413+Leupeptin1-bHex A activities of the Hex A pseudodeficient cell lines, TC72 and GM04863, a Tay-Sachs disease cell line WG1881, and a Sandhoff disease cell line, GM00294, are presented as a percentage of the activity of a normal fibroblast cell line MCH065 (100%).419 ± 52141 ± 8154 ± 515 ± 278 ± 5Percentage1-bHex A activities of the Hex A pseudodeficient cell lines, TC72 and GM04863, a Tay-Sachs disease cell line WG1881, and a Sandhoff disease cell line, GM00294, are presented as a percentage of the activity of a normal fibroblast cell line MCH065 (100%).1003437419The activities were determined by incubating a 30-μl reaction mix containing 4–8 μg of cell extract protein and 20 μl of 4 mm 4-MUGS in citrate-phosphate buffer, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, pH 4.4, for 120 min at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab Isolation and Property Studies of Mutant Hex AHex A was separated from Hex B and Hex S as shown in Fig. 3. The 0–0.215m NaCl gradient, followed by 0.215 m NaCl, eluted almost all Hex A from the column, and 0.3 m NaCl eluted all of the Hex S (Fig. 3). The activity peaks corresponding to Hex A and Hex S possessed activities toward both the synthetic substrates, 4-MUG and 4-MUGS. The Hex B peak had activity only toward 4-MUG.The identity of the eluted activities was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3, inset). Only the β-subunit was detected in the Hex B fractions; α- and β-subunits were in the Hex A fractions; and only the α-subunit was in the 0.3 m NaCl-eluted Hex S fraction. An additional peak, of unknown identity, was eluted with 0.5m NaCl. This fraction contained both the α- and β-subunits and has previously been observed (37Emiliani C. Falzetti F. Orlacchio A. Stirling J.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 211-215Google Scholar).Kinetic StudiesThe benign mutations, R247W and R249W, do not have a significant effect on the Km of Hex A for the synthetic substrates, although the apparent Vmaxwas substantially decreased (Table II). To determine if the lower apparent Vmax was the result of a change in catalytic activity of Hex A or a reduction of the α-subunit protein, the α-subunit protein levels of equal Hex A activities toward 4-MUGS were analyzed by Western blot. The levels of protein in normal and Hex A-pseudodeficient fibroblasts and the COS-7 cells transfected with normal and benign mutation-containing αpSVLs were similar (Fig. 4). This indicated that the benign mutations affect Hex A by reducing the α-subunit protein level, not by affecting Hex A's affinity toward the synthetic substrates and/or Hex A's catalytic activity.Table IIKinetic studies of Hex A expressed in COS-7 cells and fibroblasts4-MUG4-MUGSKmVmaxKmVmaxmmμmol/h/mgmmμmol/h/mgWP092-aHex A was isolated from normal (WP09) and Hex A pseudodeficient (TC72) fibroblast cells.0.83 ± 0.17 (n = 2)62.0 ± 3.6 (n = 3)0.56 ± 0.03 (n = 2)2.6 ± 0.22 (n = 2)TC72/R247W2-aHex A was isolated from normal (WP09) and Hex A pseudodeficient (TC72) fibroblast cells.0.65 ± 0.10 (n = 2)15.9 ± 1.14 (n = 2)0.48 ± 0.11 (n = 3)0.60 ± 0.15 (n = 3)COS-7/R249W2-bHex A was isolated from pCD43/αpSVLR249W-transfected COS-7 cells. n denotes the number of experiments.

The results from fibroblast and expressed Hex A plus S were shown to be similar (data not shown). Similar results were also previously reported using fibroblast extract and a treatment at 37 °C (14Grebner E.E. Mansfield D.A. Raghavan S.S. Kolodny E.H. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. Jackson L.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1986; 38: 505-514Google Scholar). Hex A plus S containing the adult onset mutation G269S was shown to be more sensitive than normal (data not shown; Ref. 25Brown C.A. Mahuran D.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1993; 53: 497-508Google Scholar). These suggested that the benign mutations do not increase the heat sensitivity of the α-subunit in vitro.Optimal pH of Benign Mutation-containing Hex AThe optimal pH for the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate by Hex A in the cell extracts from MCH065 and TC72 fibroblasts and the COS-7 cells, transfected with pCD43/αpSVL or pCD43/C739TαpSVL or pCD43/C745TαpSVL, was 4.0–4.4 (data not shown).Effect of the Benign Mutations on α-Subunit Processing and Stability in VivoTo determine the effects of the benign mutations on Hex A and S in transfected COS-7 cells and on Hex A in the fibroblasts from a normal and a Hex A-pseudodeficient subject with the C739T(R247W) on one chromosome and a null mutation on the other, pulse-chase metabolic labeling was used.The specificity of the antibody against human Hex A, which was used for immunoprecipitation, was analyzed; it was shown to recognize both the free and β-subunit-associated forms of the α-subunit (data not shown). The anti-Hex B and anti-α-subunit antisera were confirmed to have the specificity described by Proia (34Proia R.L. d'Azzo A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3350-3354Google Scholar). The anti-Hex B antibody recognizes all β-subunit monomers and β-subunit containing dimers, while the anti-α-subunit antibody recognizes only the α-monomer.Effect of the Benign Mutation, R247W, on Phosphorylation of the α-SubunitFibroblasts from normal, Hex A-pseudodeficient, Tay-Sachs disease and Sandoff disease subjects were pulse-labeled with32P. The radiolabeled forms of β-hexosaminidase were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against human Hex A, Hex B, and the α-subunit, separated by gradient SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Three separate experiments showed a considerable amount of precursor α-subunit in the free and β-subunit-associated forms in both normal and the C739T benign mutation-containing fibroblasts (data not shown), suggesting that Hex A with the benign mutation was normally phosphorylated. The Tay-Sachs disease sample did not show a 32P-labeled band corresponding to the α-subunit, and the Sandhoff disease sample did not exhibit a band corresponding to the radiolabeled β-subunit.Effect of the Benign Mutation, R247W, on the Secretion of Hex AData derived from three repeated experiments showed that the secretion of the precursor α-subunit from both normal and Hex A-pseudodeficient fibroblasts was enhanced by growth in the presence of NH4Cl (Fig. 5). The effect of NH4Cl on the dissociation of Hex A and the mannose 6-phosphate receptor occurs in the prelysosomal and lysosomal compartments (44Seglen P.O. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 737-764Google Scholar). Normal secretion suggests that the benign mutation did not affect the process"
https://openalex.org/W1972225304,"To induce oxidative stress, HepG2 cells were exposed to a compound known as gramoxone. This compound undergoes a one-electron reduction to form a stable free radical which is capable of generating reactive oxygen species. We demonstrated that exposure of HepG2 cells to gramoxone (0.1 μm) resulted in a 2-fold decrease in apoA-I mRNA with no significant change in apoB and apoE mRNA levels. To examine if increased rates of mRNA degradation were responsible for the reduction in apoA-I mRNA levels, mRNA half-lives were measured in the presence of actinomycin D with and without gramoxone treatment. These studies revealed a 4-fold increase in the rate of apoA-I mRNA degradation in cells exposed to gramoxone. In similarly treated cells, nuclear run-off assays indicated that the transcription rate of the apoA-I gene was also increased 2-fold. Consistent with nuclear run-off assays, transient transfection experiments using a series of pGL2-derived luciferase reporter plasmids containing the human apoAI proximal promoter demonstrated that gramoxone treatment increased apoA-I promoter activity 2-fold. We have identified a potential “antioxidant response element” (ARE) in the apoA-I promoter region that may be responsible for the increase in apoA-I transcriptional activity by gramoxone. Gel mobility shift assays with an ARE oligonucleotide revealed increased levels of a specific protein-DNA complex that formed with nuclear extracts from gramoxone-treated cells. UV cross-linking experiments with the ARE and nuclear extracts from either untreated or gramoxone-treated cells detected proteins of approximately 100 and 115 kDa. When a single copy of the ARE was inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter in a luciferase reporter plasmid, a significant 2-fold induction in luciferase activity was observed in HepG2 cells in the presence of gramoxone. In contrast, a plasmid containing a mutant apoAI-ARE did not confer responsiveness to gramoxone. Furthermore, pGL2 (apoAI-250 mutant ARE), in which point mutations eliminated the ARE in the apoAI promoter, showed no increase in luciferase activity in response to gramoxone. Taken together, the data suggest that gramoxone affects apoA-I mRNA levels by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that lowering low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; apoA-I, apolipoprotein AI; ARE, antioxidant response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDL, high density lipoprotein; XRE, xenobiotic response element. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; apoA-I, apolipoprotein AI; ARE, antioxidant response element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDL, high density lipoprotein; XRE, xenobiotic response element. or raising high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) reduces cardiovascular risk (1Waters D. Lesperance J. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91(1B): 10S-17SGoogle Scholar). However, among myocardial infarction survivors, greater than one-half have normal lipid levels, suggesting that factors other than lipoprotein profiles contribute to the disease process (2Wissler R.W. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91(1B): 3S-9SGoogle Scholar). One such factor appears likely to be the oxidation of LDL (3Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Google Scholar, 4Parthasarathy S. Rankin S.M. Prog. Lipid Res. 1992; 31: 127-143Google Scholar, 5Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Google Scholar). Oxidized LDL has been implicated in the formation of foam cells and thus may play an important role in the etiology of atherosclerosis (6Sparrow C.P. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2599-2604Google Scholar, 7Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 488-500Google Scholar). In contrast, oxidized HDL is not avidly taken up by macrophages, does not lead to foam cell formation (8Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Google Scholar), and may actually inhibit endothelial cell-mediated LDL modification (8Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Google Scholar, 9van Hinsbergh V.W. Scheffer M. Havekes L. Kempen H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 49-64Google Scholar). HDL is also capable of protecting against LDL peroxidation in vitro (8Parthasarathy S. Barnett J. Fong L.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 275-283Google Scholar,10Klimov A.N. Nikiforova A.A. Pleskov V.M. Kuzmin A.A. Kalashnikova N.N. Biokhimiia. 1989; 54: 118-123Google Scholar, 11Mackness M.I. Arrol S. Durrington P.N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286 (; Correction (1991) FEBS Lett.292, 307): 152-154Google Scholar). Recently, the antioxidative activity of HDL has been demonstrated in vivo (12Klimov A.N. Gurevich V.S. Nikiforova A.A. Shatilina L.V. Kuzmin A.A. Plavinsky S.L. Teryukova N.P. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 100: 13-18Google Scholar). These properties suggest another protective role for HDL (in addition to its involvement in “reverse cholesterol transport”) in reducing atherosclerotic risk. Reduced levels of plasma HDL are observed in cigarette smokers (13Haffner S.M. Applebaum-Bowden D. Wahl P.W. Hoover J.J. Warnick G.R. Albers J.J. Hazzard W.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 169-177Google Scholar,14Assmann G. Schulte H. Schriewer H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1984; 22: 397-402Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms responsible for the decrease are not known. During cigarette smoking, the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produces free radicals (15Pryor W.A. Prier D.G. Church D.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1983; 47: 345-355Google Scholar). The presence of quinone and hydroquinone complexes in the particulate phase of cigarette smoke can result in generation of reactive species such as superoxides and hydrogen peroxide. If a metal catalyst is present, hydroxyl radicals will also form. Consequently, the smoker has a higher free radical burden and a lower HDL level than the nonsmoker and it has been suggested that this may contribute to the smoker's higher risk of developing atherosclerosis (16Wilhelmsson C. Vedin J.A. Elmfeldt D. Tibblin G. Wilhelmsen L. Lancet. 1975; 1: 415-420Google Scholar). In this study, we determined whether oxidative stress could affect the synthesis of apoA-I, the major protein constituent of HDL. To induce oxidative stress, the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was exposed to gramoxone (also called paraquat and methyl viologen). This compound is a quaternary dipyridyl that is not metabolized but undergoes a one-electron reduction to form a stable free radical (17Michaelis L. Hill E.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1933; 16: 859-873Google Scholar, 18Michaelis L. Hill E.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1933; 55: 1481-1494Google Scholar). Redox cycling of the free radical decreases the levels of reducing equivalents in the cell and it is the critical biomedical event in gramoxone toxicity (19Bus J.S. Gibson J.E. Environ. Health Perspect. 1984; 55: 37-46Google Scholar). Gramoxone has no other known mechanism of cytotoxicity (20DeGray J.A. Ramakrishna Rao D.N. Mason R.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 129: 145-152Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that exposure of HepG2 cells to gramoxone resulted in a 2-fold reduction of apoA-I mRNA, with no significant effect on apoB and apoE mRNA levels. The observed 2-fold decrease in apoA-I mRNA levels appears to be the result of a 4-fold increase in apoA-I mRNA degradation rate combined with a 2-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the apoA-I gene. The apoA-I gene promoter contains a sequence match with the 5′-flanking region of the rat glutathione S-transferase (GST) Ya subunit (21Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Google Scholar) and the NADP(H) quinone reductase genes (22Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Google Scholar). The match involves the motif, 5′-puGTGACNNNGC-3′ (where pu is a purine and N is any nucleotide), corresponding to a putative antioxidant response element (ARE) (21Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Google Scholar, 22Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Google Scholar). One copy of the element with one mismatched nucleotide is present in the apoA-I promoter between nucleotides −142 and −132 relative to the transcription start site of the gene. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that the putative ARE is necessary for gramoxone-mediated induction of human apoA-I gene expression. By performing gel mobility shift experiments, we found that exposure of HepG2 cells to gramoxone resulted in increased binding of nuclear proteins to the ARE. UV cross-linking experiments identified two polypeptides of approximately 100 and 115 kDa. Taken together, the data suggest that the mechanism(s) by which gramoxone affects apoA-I mRNA levels occur(s) at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were synthesized using the Beckman Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following oligonucleotides (and their complementary strands) were prepared: apoAI-ARE, 5′-CAGCCCCAGGGACAGAGCTG-3′; mutated ARE, 5′-CAGCCCCATTTGAGTGTATG-3′; GST-ARE, 5′-CTAATGGTGACAAAGCAG-3′; xenobiotic response element (XRE), 5′-AGTGCTGTCACGCTAG-3′. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in T75 flasks containing 20 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (23Tam S.-P. Archer T.K. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1670-1675Google Scholar). Freshly confluent monolayers were washed twice with minimal essential medium and then incubated with fresh medium for 0–8 h in the absence or presence of gramoxone, dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, ranging from 0.1 μm to 10 μm. In some experiments, gramoxone and cycloheximide were added to cells to give final concentrations of 0.1 μm and 10 μg/ml, respectively. Where noted, HepG2 cells were also treated with or without gramoxone and in the presence of actinomycin D (1 μg/ml), for various time periods as described in the figure legends. Cell viability was routinely monitored by trypan blue exclusion and lactate dehydrogenase leakage as described previously (24Tam S.-P. Deeley R.G. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 235-243Google Scholar). In all experiments the number of dead cells never exceeded 5% of the total number of cells. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA detection and quantitation were determined by slot blot analyses. For slot blots, multiple RNA samples (0.5–5.0 μg) from cells cultured under a variety of conditions were denatured with formaldehyde and applied to wells of a slot blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) onto Zeta-Probe GT membranes. Blots were prehybridized and hybridized with nick-translated apoA-I, apoB, and apoE cDNA probes as described (26Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Google Scholar). Detection of catalase mRNA levels was essentially under the same conditions as described for apolipoprotein mRNAs (26Tam S.-P. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 91: 51-61Google Scholar). The catalase cDNA probe was obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). All results were normalized using densitometric analyses of slot blots probed with radiolabeled oligo(dT) to correct for loading variations. Nuclei were prepared according to the procedure of Bartalena and co-workers (27Bartalena L. Farsetti A. Flink I.L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Google Scholar). An in vitro nuclear run-off transcription assay was carried out as described (27Bartalena L. Farsetti A. Flink I.L. Robbins J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 935-942Google Scholar) with minor modifications (24Tam S.-P. Deeley R.G. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 235-243Google Scholar). Procedures for nuclear run-off transcription assays and preparation of nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells have been described in detail previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). For bandshift assays, nuclear extracts (1.0 μg) were incubated with 100 μg of poly(dI-dC) in binding buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol and 5 μm ZnCl2, on ice for 30 min. Then 2 fmol (10,000 cpm) of 5′-end labeled synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to either the apoAI-ARE or GST-ARE were added to the reaction mixtures and incubated on ice for another 30 min. Procedures for bandshift assays have been described in detail previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). Competition assays were performed by adding the unlabeled competitor DNA 15 min prior to the addition of either labeled apoAI-ARE or GST-ARE as indicated in the figure legends. Ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking experiments were carried out as described by Wu et al. (29Wu C. Wilson S. Walder B. David I. Paisley T. Zimarino V. Ueda H. Science. 1987; 238: 1247-1253Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the binding reactions were first carried out as described above for bandshift assays, except that the reaction was scaled up 25-fold. The binding reactions were irradiated on ice for 30 min with a 254-nm wavelength ultraviolet source (Stratalinker). Equal amounts of 2 × SDS sample buffer were added to the irradiated reactions. The samples were then heated at 90 °C for 10 min and electrophoresed on a 8% polyacrylamide/SDS denaturing gel by the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Two GeneLightTM vectors (Promega, Life Technologies) were used: pGL2-Basic (pGL2-B) and pGL2-Promoter (pGL2-P). A 491-base pair DNA fragment of the human apoA-I promoter between nucleotides −491 to +1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification described in detail previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). The sequence of this DNA fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The fragment was inserted into the XhoI site of the pGL2-Basic vector, upstream of the luciferase gene. This plasmid is hereafter referred to as pGL2(apoAI-491)luc. Plasmid pGL2(apoAI-250)luc was constructed by releasing a DNA fragment (−491 to −251 of the apoA-I promoter) from pGL2(apoAI-491)luc usingSmaI. The vector was gel purified and re-ligated. Plasmid pGL2(apoAI-250 mutant ARE)luc was prepared by a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol as described by Morrison and Desrosiers (31Morrison H.G. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 454-457Google Scholar). To generate this mutated ARE plasmid, two sets of primers were used. One set of primers, designated GL and LUC, was hybridized to specific regions of the plasmid pGL2. The other set of primers which contained the mutagenic ARE residues were named primers FOR and REV. The primers GL (5′-TGTATCTTATGGTACTGTAACTG-3′) and REV (5′-GATCATACACTCAAATGGGGCTGGG-3′) were complementary to the noncoding strand of DNA while primers FOR (5′-CCCATTTGAGTGTATGATCCTTGAAC-3′) and LUC (5′-GGCGTCTTCCATTTTACC-3′) were complementary to the coding strand of DNA. The plasmid pGL2(apoAI-250)luc was used as the polymerase chain reaction template. Amplification was carried out as described previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). The DNA fragment generated was then digested withSmaI and HindIII and the resulting DNA fragment was purified from an agarose gel. The purified DNA fragment was cloned into the SmaI and HindIII sites of the pGL2-Basic (Promega Inc.) and used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells. DNA was prepared from individual clones by the alkaline lysis miniprep procedure and the entire DNA insert including the area of mutagenesis was sequenced using the sequenase version 2.0 system (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A series of pGL2-P vectors containing apoAI-ARE, GST-ARE, and mutated ARE were also constructed. pGL2-P was digested with the restriction enzymes KpnI and NheI. The restriction digest was electrophoresed and the digested plasmid was gel purified. Synthetic oligomers corresponding to the putative ARE from the apoA-I promoter (apoAI-ARE), the consensus GST-ARE, and mutated ARE were inserted individually into the KpnI and NheI of the linearized pGL2-P vectors. All synthetic oligomers contained a 5′-KpnI and a 3′-NheI site to facilitate unidirectional cloning into the pGL2-P vector. The sequence of all pGL2-P constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, was maintained as monolayers on 100-mm plates in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient DNA transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure described by Gorman and co-workers (32Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar) and detailed previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). The cells were then cultured in the absence or presence of gramoxone (0.1 μm) ranging from 0 to 8 h. Transfected HepG2 cells were harvested by washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for luciferase activity as described in the Luciferase Assay Kit Technical Manual (Promega, Inc.) (33GenelightTM Plasmids Technical Manual.Promega Corp. 1991; : 1-39Google Scholar). This assay has also been described in detail previously (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). In all transfections, 5 μg of an internal control plasmid (pSGΔLacZ) containing the E. coli Lac Z gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter and enhancer, was included to correct for differences in transfection and harvesting efficiency. Transfected cells were harvested as described (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activities in the cell lysates determined (28Zhang X. Chen Z.-Q. Wang Z. Mohan W. Tam S.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27152-27160Google Scholar). The pGL2-promoter vector which contains a SV40 promoter is used as a reference for both transfection and luciferase assays. All luciferase activities are reported as mean ± S.E. Significance of group differences was determined by Student's t test, using two-tailed p values. The effects of gramoxone on levels of apolipoprotein mRNAs were examined by slot blot analysis using the level of total poly(A)+ RNA determined by oligo(dT) hybridization to control for variation in RNA loading. Exposure of HepG2 cells to gramoxone at concentrations of 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 μm for 8 h resulted in a 2-fold reduction in apoA-I mRNA levels. However, there were no significant changes in the levels of apoB and apoE mRNA at any of the above concentrations of drug tested. At a concentration of >10 μm, gramoxone decreased cell viability significantly (data not shown). Therefore, in all further experiments, the drug was used at 0.1 μm. Time course studies of the effect of gramoxone on apoA-I mRNA levels in HepG2 cells were performed to determine whether or not the decline in steady state levels of apoA-I mRNA could be seen earlier than 8 h. After 2 h of exposure to gramoxone, apoA-I mRNA levels decreased to 50% of control values and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the remaining 6 h (Fig. 1). No significant differences in apoB and apoE mRNA levels were observed when HepG2 cells were cultured in the presence of gramoxone over the 8-h period. To ensure that the cells were under oxidative stress, the levels of catalase mRNA were also determined. Exposure of HepG2 cells to gramoxone resulted in a 4- and 10-fold increase in steady state levels of catalase mRNA at 6 and 8 h, respectively. This induction could be suppressed by simultaneously exposing the cells to 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, a free radical scavenger (data not shown). The 2-fold decrease in apoA-I mRNA levels could be the result of either a decrease in rates of transcription or an increased degradation of the apoA-I mRNA. Therefore, we measured the transcription rate of the apoA-I gene using isolated nuclei from HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of gramoxone for 0–8 h. Nuclear run-off assays indicated that the rate of transcription of apoA-I gene increased approximately 2-fold between 4 and 8 h after gramoxone treatment (Fig.2). To determine if the rate of apoA-I mRNA degradation also changed in response to gramoxone treatment, the turnover of apoA-I mRNA was determined in the presence of actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) with and without gramoxone. The half-lives obtained for apoA-I mRNAs following the addition of actinomycin D in the absence or presence of gramoxone were approximately 12.5 ± 1.5 and 3.0 ± 0.4 h, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, there was a 4-fold increase in the rate of degradation of apoA-I mRNA when HepG2 cells were subjected to oxidative stress. To further investigate the increase in transcription detected by nuclear run-off assays, transient transfection experiments were carried out using a series of pGL2-derived luciferase reporter plasmids. As shown in Fig.4, both pGL2(apoAI-491)luc and pGL2(apoAI-250)luc constructs showed a significant 2-fold induction of luciferase activity in HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of gramoxone for 8 h. We hypothesized that the 2-fold increase in apoA-I promoter activity could involve a potential ARE detected by sequence comparison with the GST Ya subunit and NADP(H) quinone reductase genes. To test this hypothesis, we constructed the pGL2(apoAI-250 mutant ARE) in which the entire ARE consensus sequence was replaced (G → T, C → A, T → G, A → C). Results from these studies demonstrated that pGL2(apoAI-250 mutant ARE) showed no increase in luciferase activity in response to gramoxone treatment. To confirm that the ARE was able to confer responsiveness to gramoxone, transient transfection experiments were carried out using a series of pGL2-P/luc constructs. The control vector pGL2-P/luc demonstrated no change in luciferase activity in response to gramoxone treatment. Plasmids with one copy of the ARE derived from the apoA-I or GST promoters pGL2(apoAI-ARE)/luc and pGL2(GST-ARE)/luc inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter, displayed a 4-fold increase in luciferase expression relative to the control vector. This suggests that the ARE may enhance the basal rate of transcription of the reporter gene. Furthermore, the luciferase activity of pGL2(apoAI-ARE)/luc and pGL2(GST-ARE)/luc was increased by an additional 2-fold in the presence of gramoxone. However, a plasmid containing one copy of the mutant apoAI-ARE, pGL2P(apoAI-mutant ARE)/luc, had a basal rate of expression similar to the control vector and displayed no responsiveness to gramoxone. Mobility shift experiments were performed to further examine the mechanism by which the ARE confers responsiveness to gramoxone. A double-stranded oligonucleotide (apoAI-ARE), corresponding to the apoA-I promoter between nucleotides −149 and −130, was end-labeled with 32P and analyzed for its ability to bind to nuclear proteins isolated from HepG2 cells cultured in the presence and absence of gramoxone. As shown in Fig.5 A, a retardation complex was detected with extracts prepared from control HepG2 cells. After 1 h of gramoxone treatment, the levels of this complex increased 2-fold. This induction was not blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide (data not shown). In nuclear extracts from gramoxone-treated HepG2 cells, binding to the labeled apoAI-ARE was efficiently blocked by competition with 50–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled apoAI-ARE and to a lesser extent with unlabeled GST-ARE. No competition was observed with up to 100-fold molar excess of the XRE or a mutant ARE oligomer. In contrast, when mobility shift assays were carried out using the GST-ARE as a probe, similar levels of binding activity were observed using nuclear extracts isolated from control and gramoxone-treated HepG2 cells (Fig. 5 B). Binding to the labeled GST-ARE probe was also effectively inhibited by competition with 50–100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GST-ARE. However, unlabeled apoAI-ARE was not able to block the formation of the protein-DNA complex efficiently. Both negative control oligomers (XRE and mutant ARE) showed no competition in the binding activity (Fig. 5 B). UV cross-linking studies indicated binding of two polypeptides of apparent molecular masses of approximately 115 and 100 kDa to the apoAI-ARE in both untreated and gramoxone-treated nuclear extracts (Fig. 6 A), with the 100-kDa species being the predominant one bound in both extracts. Densitometry demonstrated that gramoxone treatment increased in labeling of the 115- and 100-kDa proteins by approximately 71 and approximately 105%, respectively. Neither polypeptide was detected when binding reactions were supplemented with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled apoAI-ARE (Fig. 6 B). UV cross-linking experiments were also carried out by using labeled GST-ARE as a probe to determine whether or not the proteins with similar apparent molecular masses were bound. As shown in Fig.6 C, four polypeptides of approximately 21, 28, 57, and 98 kDa were labeled using gramoxone-treated nuclear extracts and a GST-ARE. Similar results were also observed when control nuclear extracts were utilized (data not shown). Densitometric analyses indicated that the 57-kDa protein was the predominant species bound, followed by the 21-, 98-, and 28-kDa protein bands. Binding of these four polypeptides to the labeled GST-ARE probe was efficiently blocked by competition with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled GST-ARE. It has been reported that hyperoxic conditions increase steady state mRNA levels of catalase, Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in human endothelial cells (34Maitre B. Jormot L. Junod A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L635-L643Google Scholar, 35Cowan D.B. Weisel R.D. Williams W.G. Mickle D.A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26904-26910Google Scholar). In HepG2 cells, we found that oxidative stress induced by treatment with gramoxone resulted in a 10-fold increase in steady state levels of catalase mRNA and a 2-fold increase in levels of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase mRNA (data not shown). Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of gramoxone, this response was eliminated by the addition of the free radical scavenger, Me2SO (34Maitre B. Jormot L. Junod A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L635-L643Google Scholar). In contrast, gramoxone treatment decreased the steady state levels of apoA-I mRNA 2-fold without affecting the levels of mRNAs for other major apolipoproteins such as apoB and apoE. This down-regulation of apoAI mRNA in response to oxidant treatment suggests that decreased apoA-I synthesis may contribute to the observed reduction in plasma HDL seen in cigarette smokers (13Haffner S.M. Applebaum-Bowden D. Wahl P.W. Hoover J.J. Warnick G.R. Albers J.J. Hazzard W.R. Arteriosclerosis. 1985; 5: 169-177Google Scholar, 14Assmann G. Schulte H. Schriewer H. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1984; 22: 397-402Google Scholar, 15Pryor W.A. Prier D.G. Church D.F. Environ. Health Perspect. 1983; 47: 345-355Google Scholar, 16Wilhelmsson C. Vedin J.A. Elmfeldt D. Tibblin G. Wilhelmsen L. Lancet. 1975; 1: 415-420Google Scholar). Our studies demonstrate for the first time that oxidative stress may act by selectively decreasing hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels. Although the molecular mechanisms by which gramoxone modulates apoA-I are not completely understood, we have provided evidence that the 2-fold reduction in apoA-I mRNA level results from a combination of a 4-fold increase in apoA-I mRNA degradation and a 2-fold increase in apoA-I gene transcription. This apparently paradoxical effect on mRNA synthesis and stability is not without precedent. For instance, apoA-I gene transcription decreases during chronic hyperthyroidism while the hepatic abundance of apoA-I increases 3-fold by a mechanism that involves stabilization and/or more efficient processing of the nuclear apoA-I mRNA precursors (36Lin-Lee Y.-C. Strobl W. Soyal S. Radosavljevic M. Song M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsh W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 249-259Google Scholar, 37Strobl W. Gorder N.L. Lin-Lee Y.-C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsch W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 659-667Google Scholar). This observation has prompted the suggestion that apoA-I gene transcription may be subject to feedback regulation and that degradation of nuclear apoA-I RNA could have a positive effect on apoA-I gene transcription (36Lin-Lee Y.-C. Strobl W. Soyal S. Radosavljevic M. Song M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsh W. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 249-259Google Scholar, 37Strobl W. Gorder N.L. Lin-Lee Y.-C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Patsch W. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 659-667Google Scholar). While the suggestion remains a hypothesis, the data presented here are also consistent with the possibility that the increase in transcription is a compensatory response to the decrease in apoA-I mRNA levels. In addition to the perturbations of thyroid hormone status, dietary cholesterol and saturated fat can also affect apoA-I gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (38Srivastava R.A.K.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19833-19838Google Scholar). In addition to the proposed autoregulation of apoA-I transcription described above, apoA-I gene expression could be directly responsive to oxidative stress since the apoA-I promoter does contain a potential ARE, although the sequence differs by one nucleotide from the putative ARE (21Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Google Scholar, 22Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Google Scholar). Bandshift assays demonstrate that both untreated and gramoxone-treated HepG2 nuclear extracts contain factors that bind specifically to the ARE and these factors can be induced by gramoxone treatment. The increase in protein-DNA complex formation was apparent within 1 h of gramoxone exposure and was not blocked by inhibiting protein synthesis, suggesting that the increased binding activity was attributable to modification of a pre-existing factor. UV cross-linking experiments identified two proteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 100 and 115 kDa (Fig. 6 A). Although present in control HepG2 nuclear extracts, gramoxone treatment resulted in an increase in binding of both proteins. Our data differ from a report by Nguyen and Pickett (43Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Google Scholar) which indicates that proteins UV cross-linked to the GST-ARE have apparent molecular masses of approximately 28 and 45 kDa and that the DNA binding activity of these proteins are not increased by t-butylhydroquinone treatment in HepG2 cells. To examine this discrepancy, we carried out UV cross-linking experiments using labeled GST-ARE as a probe together with either control or gramoxone-treated nuclear extracts. Our results demonstrated four polypeptides (apparent molecular masses of 21, 28, 57, and 98 kDa) were cross-linked to the GST-ARE after UV irradiation (Fig.6 C). In contrast to apoAI-ARE UV cross-linked proteins, the DNA binding activity of these proteins was not increased by gramoxone treatment in HepG2 cells (data not shown). The 28- and 57-kDa proteins may correspond to the two species described by Pickett and co-workers (43Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13535-13539Google Scholar). However, at present it is not clear why these investigators do not also observe the 21- and 98-kDa polypeptides. Although the 98-kDa protein cross-linked to the GST-ARE has a very similar size to the smaller and more predominant species cross-linked to the apoAI-ARE, the lack of inducibility of the 98-kDa protein by gramoxone treatment suggests that these two proteins are different. This suggestion is supported by competition bandshift experiments which also indicate differences in the protein binding to these two elements (Fig. 5,A and B). Transient transfection experiments using pGL2-P-derived luciferase reporter plasmids confirmed a functional role for the ARE in apoA-I gene transcription in response to gramoxone. Constructs which contain nucleotides −491 to +1 and −250 to +1 upstream from the transcription start site (+1) of the human apoA-I gene show a significant 2-fold increase in luciferase activity in the presence or gramoxone (Fig. 4). The involvement of the ARE in gramoxone-mediated induction of apoA-I gene expression was demonstrated by using the pGL2(apoAI-250 mutant ARE) in which the consensus ARE was eliminated by multiple point mutations. Results from these studies indicated that this plasmid had lost gramoxone inducibility. In addition, we also examined whether or not the ARE could function independently as a regulatory element using a heterologous promoter. These studies demonstrated that the plasmids pGL2P(apoAI-ARE)/luc and pGL2P(GST-ARE)/luc, where one copy of either the apoAI-ARE or the GST-ARE was inserted upstream of the SV40 promoter, conferred gramoxone inducibility. However, a plasmid containing one copy of the mutated apoAI-ARE pGL2P(apoAI-mutated ARE)/luc displayed no response to gramoxone treatment. These data indicated that the ARE located in the apoA-I promoter region can function independently as a bona fide regulatory element that is responsive to oxidative stress. In summary, we have identified gramoxone-inducible nuclear proteins which bind specifically to the ARE region of the human apoA-I gene. These protein-DNA interactions appear likely to be involved in the mechanism by which oxidant or antioxidant-inducible trans-acting nuclear factors modulate apoA-I gene transcription. Taken together, our data demonstrate that gramoxone affects hepatic apoA-I mRNA abundance by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

These and other data suggest the following sequence of events that lead to the reactivation of the HPRT gene after 5aCdr treatment: (a) hemi-demethylation of the promoter, (b) an “opening” of chromatin structure detectable as increased nuclease sensitivity, (c) transcription factor binding to the promoter, (d) assembly of the transcription complex, and (e) synthesis of HPRT RNA.

The inactivation of one X chromosome within each female somatic nucleus generates a transcriptionally active and inactive allele of most X-linked genes and results in dosage compensation for X-linked genes between males and females.

All of these studies support the notion that hypermethylation of the 5′ CpG island associated with many X-linked housekeeping genes is involved in the transcriptional silencing of these genes on the inactive X chromosome. The ability to demethylate and reactivate individual genes on the human inactive X chromosome in rodent-human somatic cell hybrids by treatment with 5-azacytidine or 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5aCdr) 1The abbreviations used are: 5aCdr5-aza-2′-deoxycytidineHPRThypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferasePGK-1phosphoglycerate kinase 1DMSdimethyl sulfatekbkilobasebpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcription-PCRLMPCRligation-mediated PCR (6Mohandas T.

Genet. 1987; 13: 191-204Google Scholar) suggests that transcriptional regulation of X-linked genes by X chromosome inactivation involves some measure of local control either at the level of individual genes or at the level of chromatin domains. Reactivation of inactive X-linked genes such as the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK-1) genes after 5-azacytidine or 5aCdr treatment is associated with both a change in chromatin structure from a nuclease-inaccessible to a nuclease-accessible conformation and a reduction in DNA methylation levels in the 5′ CpG island (17Hansen R.S. Ellis N.A. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4692-4699Google Scholar, 21Wolf S.F. Migeon B.R.

(22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar) assayed four parameters during 5aCdr reactivation of the human HPRT gene in a hamster-human somatic cell hybrid cell line (X8–6T2) containing the inactive human X chromosome. The parameters examined were HPRT mRNA levels and three properties of the 5′ region, including hemi- and symmetrical demethylation of DNA, and MspI nuclease sensitivity of chromatin. Hemi-demethylation and MspI sensitivity were detectable 6 h after the addition of 5aCdr and reached maximum levels at 24 h, whereas symmetrical demethylation and HPRT mRNA levels became detectable at 24 h and reached maximum levels 48 h after exposure to 5aCdr. Thus, the initial events during reactivation of the HPRT gene by 5aCdr treatment are the hemi-demethylation and alteration of chromatin structure in the promoter region, followed by symmetrical demethylation and transcription of the gene. A similar sequence of events is reported for 5aCdr-mediated reactivation of the mouse APRT gene (23Cooper G.E. Bishop P.L. Turker M.S. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 221-229Google Scholar). The major question we address here is whether the binding of transcription factors to the promoter region upon 5aCdr reactivation is correlated with the early change in chromatin structure or with actual transcription of the gene (i.e. appearance of mRNA). Analysis by in vivo footprinting shows that the promoters of the active HPRT (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar) and PGK-1 (7Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Google Scholar, 15Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar) alleles are bound by transcription factors, whereas the promoters of the corresponding inactive alleles are devoid of these factors. On the active human HPRT allele, in vivo footprints are associated with each of five potential Sp1 binding sites, a potential AP2 binding site, and a region near the multiple transcription initiation sites (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). For both the HPRT andPGK-1 genes, no evidence has been found for the binding of sequence-specific repressors to the promoters of the inactive alleles. Furthermore, there is no evidence for the interaction of methylated DNA-binding proteins (25Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P. Klein F. Bird A. Cell. 1992; 69: 905-914Google Scholar) with the 5′ regions of these genes on the inactive X chromosome. These in vivo footprinting studies indicate that a major component of transcriptional silencing on the inactive X chromosome is the exclusion of transcription factors from promoter regions. To determine the timing of transcription factor binding during 5aCdr-induced reactivation of the human HPRT gene on the inactive X chromosome, we have performed dimethyl sulfate (DMS)in vivo footprinting on X8–6T2 cells at various times after initiating 5aCdr treatment. We now demonstrate that the binding of transcription factors to three sites in the promoter region correlates with the appearance of HPRT mRNA rather than with the preceding change in nuclease sensitivity of chromatin. Thus, the remodeling of chromatin structure during 5aCdr reactivation of the HPRTgene on the inactive X chromosome precedes and thus does not require the binding of at least three sequence-specific transcription factors to the promoter region. DNA samples were prepared from cultures of cell lines described previously (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar, 26Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Briefly, GM00468 (National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository) is a normal diploid human male fibroblast cell line containing an active X chromosome. Cell line 4.12 (generously provided by David Ledbetter) is a hamster-human somatic cell hybrid containing only the active human X chromosome in the HPRT-deficient hamster cell line RJK88; RJK88 carries a deletion of the endogenous hamsterHPRT gene. GM06318 is also a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid containing an active human X chromosome. Cell lines X8–6T2 and 8121 are hamster-human somatic hybrids containing an inactive human X chromosome (20Ellis N. Keitges E. Gartler S.M. Rocchi M. Somatic Cell Mol.

X8–6T2 cells were treated with 5aCdr as described previously by Sasaki et al. (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with 0.4 μg/ml 5aCdr in growth medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 40 μg/ml gentamicin) for 24 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and returned to normal medium. Assaying chromatin structure changes during 5aCdr reactivation was performed by nuclease digestion of isolated nuclei as described by Sasaki et al. using the restriction enzyme MspI (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were isolated from X8–6T2 cells 0, 12, 24, 32, 48, and 60 h after initiating treatment with 5aCdr. Nuclei from each time point were treated with 0, 200, and 600 units/ml MspI, and genomic DNA was isolated and digested to completion with PstI and then subjected to Southern blot analysis with human HPRT hybridization probe PB1.7. The approximate positions of the clustered MspI sites, the PB1.7 hybridization probe, the 1.6-kb Msp-3′Pstsub-band, and the transcription factor binding sites are shown in Fig.1. Quantitation of hybridization signals in Southern blots was performed by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics) in the PhosphorImager Analysis Facility of the Markey Molecular Medicine Center at the University of Washington. The radioactivity in each 3.3-kb 5′Pst-3′Pst band and 1.6-kbMsp-3′Pst sub-band was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis and expressed in PhosphorImager units. The relative levels of nuclease digestion in Fig. 6 were calculated as follows: percentage maximal = 100 × [Mspsub-band − background]/([Msp sub-band − background] + Pst band). Msp sub-band is the value of PhosphorImager units of the 1.6-kbMsp-3′Pst sub-band using 200 units ofMspI; background is the PhosphorImager units of the 1.6-kbMsp-3′Pst sub-band for 0 units ofMspI; and Pst band is the PhosphorImager units of the 3.3-kb 5′Pst-3′Pst band at 200 units ofMspI. Detecting the appearance of human HPRT mRNA was performed by RT-PCR as described by Sasakiet al. (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). The position of the forward HPRT RT-PCR primer (TCCTCCTGAGCAGTCAGC) is shown in Fig. 1. The reverse primer (GGCGATGTCAATAGGACTC) is located in exon 9. First-strand cDNA was reverse-transcribed from total RNA with random hexamer primers and amplified by PCR with human HPRT-specific primers. PCR products were fractionated on agarose gels, Southern blotted, and hybridized with a radiolabeled human HPRT cDNA probe; the human HPRT-specific RT-PCR product is 794 bp. Quantitation of hybridization signals in Southern blots was performed by PhosphorImager analysis as described previously. The radioactivity in each 794-bp HPRT RT-PCR product was quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis for each 5aCdr-treated sample (at 0, 12, 24, 32, 48, and 60 h) using 0.5 μg of RNA in the RT-PCR reaction and averaging the results of duplicate RT-PCR reactions. The relative levels of human HPRT mRNA in representative samples on the Southern blot were calculated in Fig. 6 as follows: percentage maximal = 100 × [(units 5aCdr − background)/micrograms of RNA]/[(units GM06318 − background)/micrograms of RNA]. Units 5aCdr is the PhosphorImager units of the 794-bp HPRT RT-PCR product, background is the average PhosphorImager units at seven separate points on the autoradiogram that did not contain experimental samples, micrograms of RNA is the micrograms of RNA used in the RT-PCR reaction (0.5 μg of RNA was used for all calculations), and units GM06318 is the number of PhosphorImager units of the GM06318 samples after the total RNA for the GM06318 sample was normalized to that of the experimental samples according to the amount of MIC2 RT-PCR product. HPRT values for the GM06318 sample were considered to represent 100% reactivation. DMS treatment of cells, DNA purification, and piperidine cleavage of DMS-treated DNA were performed essentially as described previously (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar, 29Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Google Scholar). 5aCdr-treated cells were footprintedin vivo by treatment with 0.2% DMS for 5 min in RPMI growth medium. LMPCR was carried out essentially as described by Hornstra and Yang (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar, 26Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P.

For LMPCR, primer set E was used to analyze the upper strand encompassing the −91 footprint, and primer set C was used to analyze the upper strand in the region of the GC boxes, as described previously for in vivo footprinting of the human HPRT gene (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). The position of the LMPCR primers (and the regions they analyze) and the location of the footprinted sites used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Reaction conditions for first-strand synthesis, ligation, and PCR amplification were identical to those described previously (26Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Subsequent gel electrophoresis and electroblotting were carried out as described previously, using a 5% Long Ranger gel (AT Biochem) substituted for the standard polyacrylamide DNA sequencing gel (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar, 26Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1659-1665Google Scholar,29Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Google Scholar). To visualize the final DNA sequencing ladder, strand-specific hybridization probes were synthesized from M13 clones containing the human HPRT promoter region. Probe synthesis, hybridization, washing, and autoradiography were performed as described previously (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar,26Hornstra I.K.

Quantification of transcription factor binding at position −91 was carried out by densitometry of the DNA sequencing autoradiogram. The densitometric value for the band intensity at position −91 in each sample was first normalized for loading differences using the average band intensity of eight nonfootprinted bands flanking both sides of the band at position −91 in each lane. The intensity of the −91 footprint was then expressed as a percentage of the average intensity of the same band in control cell lines 4.12 and GM00468 (Fig. 4, lanes 6 and 7), each of which carries an active human X chromosome. The basal band intensity at position −91 in naked DNA (Fig. 4, lane 1) was subtracted from each normalized value (lanes 2–5) and averaged control samples (lanes 6 and 7) before calculating the final percentage. Quantification of bands at positions −198 and −210 was carried out in the same manner, except that the average band intensity of four nonfootprinted flanking bands was used to normalize for loading differences. During the course of 5aCdr-mediated reactivation of genes on the inactive human X chromosome, the human HPRT gene was monitored for changes in chromatin structure, appearance of human HPRT mRNA, and binding of transcription factors to the promoter region. A hamster-human somatic cell hybrid containing an inactive human X chromosome (X8–6T2) was first treated with 5aCdr for 24 h and then returned to normal growth medium without 5aCdr. At various times from 0 to 60 h after the addition of 5aCdr, chromatin structure of the 5′ region was examined by nuclease sensitivity, human HPRT mRNA was detected by RT-PCR, and the binding of transcription factors was assayed by DMS in vivo footprinting. These assays were performed simultaneously on the same cultures of 5aCdr-treated cells. Discreet regions of nuclease sensitivity in the 5′ region of HPRT are known to be present only on the active gene, and these can be detected with either MspI or DNase I (21Wolf S.F. Migeon B.R. Nature. 1985; 314: 467-469Google Scholar, 22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar, 30Lin D. Chinault A.C. Somatic Cell Mol.

To examine the effect of 5aCdr on the chromatin structure of the inactiveHPRT gene, treated and untreated X8–6T2 nuclei were digested with MspI as described previously by Sasakiet al. (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, sensitivity of chromatin in the 5′ CpG island was negligible in X8–6T2 cells before 5aCdr treatment (zero time), reached near maximal levels by 12 h, and reached maximal sensitivity to digestion withMspI by 24 h after initiating treatment with 5aCdr. Thus, the major chromatin structure changes in the HPRT gene 5′ region, as reflected by the increased accessibility ofMspI sites in chromatin to cleavage by MspI, occurred within 12–24 h of exposure to 5aCdr. These results are similar to those reported by Sasaki et al. (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar) in which maximal sensitivity of chromatin to MspI digestion was achieved by 24 h after initiating 5aCdr treatment. The appearance of human HPRT mRNA in the same populations of 5aCdr-treated X8–6T2 cells was assayed by RT-PCR of total RNA. Fig. 3 shows Southern blot analysis of human HPRT RT-PCR products amplified from total RNA of 5aCdr-treated samples using a radiolabeled human HPRT cDNA hybridization probe. Human HPRT mRNA first became detectable at 24 h after the addition of 5aCdr and reached maximal levels at 60 h, when the experiment was terminated. Thus, detectable HPRT mRNA levels did not begin to appear until the chromatin structure of the 5′ region had nearly reached its maximal sensitivity to MspI, an observation similar to that of Sasaki et al. (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). The binding of transcription factors to the 5′ region during reactivation of the inactive HPRT gene by 5aCdr treatment was assayed by LMPCR in vivo footprinting (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar, 26Hornstra I.K. Nelson D.L. Warren S.T. Yang T.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1659-1665Google Scholar, 29Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 213: 179-193Google Scholar). In previous studies, an in vivo DMS footprint in the 5′ region of the human HPRT gene was detected at position −91 (relative to the translation start site) on the active human X chromosome (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar); this footprint was not detected on the inactive HPRT allele. The identical footprint was also observed in 5-azacytidine-treated cells that were hypoxanthine-, aminopterin-, and thymidine-containing medium-selected for reactivation of the human HPRT gene on the inactive X chromosome (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). This footprint is characterized by a band of strongly enhanced autoradiographic intensity at position −91 in the guanine-specific DNA sequencing ladder (as compared with the intensity of the same band in the transcriptionally inactive allele or in naked DNA), indicative of a very DMS-reactive guanine residue on the active allele due to the binding of a transcription factor in vivo. To examine the binding of transcription factor(s) to the −91 region during reactivation of the human HPRT gene, X8–6T2 cells were assayed by DMS in vivo footprinting at 0, 12, 24, 32, 48, and 60 h after the addition of 5aCdr in the same samples assayed for MspI sensitivity and HPRT mRNA. Intact 5aCdr-treated cells were treated with DMS to generate in vivo footprints as described previously, and the −91 footprint was visualized by LMPCR using primer set E (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). Given the unusually strong signal exhibited by the footprint at position −91, the binding of transcription factor(s) to this site on the HPRT gene promoter in 5aCdr-treated cells can be readily detected by an increase in the relative intensity of the band at position −91 in the final guanine-specific DNA sequencing ladder. Fig. 4 shows the results of in vivofootprinting assays on the 5aCdr-treated cells in the −91 region.Lanes 7 and 8 show the very intense DMS modification and cleavage of the guanine residue at position −91 that is indicative of the in vivo footprint in two control cell cultures containing only an active human X chromosome. Lane 1 displays the DMS modification and cleavage pattern of the HPRT 5′ region in X8–6T2 cells (containing an inactive human X chromosome) before 5aCdr treatment; this sequencing ladder is typical of thein vivo guanine-specific modification and cleavage pattern seen for the transcriptionally inactive human HPRT gene (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar) as well as for naked genomic DNA purified before DMS treatment. Samples assayed from 0–24 h (lanes 1–3) show no increase in the band intensity at position −91 relative to naked DNA. Thus, noin vivo footprint at position −91 is detectable up to 24 h after addition of 5aCdr. However, beginning at 32 h (lane 4) and continuing through 60 h (lane 6), a gradual increase in the intensity of the band corresponding to the −91 footprint is detected relative to the intensity of adjacent and surrounding nonfootprinted bands in the sequencing ladder (lanes 4–6). Quantitation of relative band intensity at position −91 by densitometric analysis is shown in Fig. 6. Thus, the binding of a transcription factor(s) at position −91 seems to correlate most closely with the appearance of HPRT mRNA, reaching its maximum level at 60 h, rather than with the alteration of chromatin structure, which reaches a maximum at 24–32 h. Thus, the remodeling of chromatin structure of the 5′ region to a more nuclease-sensitive conformation in response to 5aCdr treatment does not require binding of the transcription factor(s) to the region of the promoter surrounding position −91. A similar result is also seen upstream of position −91 in a region containing five GC boxes, potential binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 (32Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 234: 47-52Google Scholar). This region exhibits multiple footprints on the activeHPRT allele that include three guanines with enhanced DMS reactivity on the upper strand at positions −163, −198, and −210 (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). These sites of enhanced DMS reactivity are not detected on the inactive HPRT allele or on naked DNA purified before DMS treatment. We chose to analyze sites of enhanced DMS reactivity because they are more readily detectable in the subpopulation of 5aCdr-treated cells that reactivate the HPRT gene than sites that exhibit protection from DMS reactivity. Fig. 5 shows the results of LMPCR in vivo footprinting of the region containing positions −198 and −210 in X8–6T2 cells after 5aCdr treatment. As with the footprint at position −91, all samples assayed from 0–24 h (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3) showed no increase in band intensity (i.e. footprints) at position −198 and −210. A detectable increase in −198 and −210 band intensities is observed beginning at 32 h (Fig. 5, lane 4) relative to adjacent bands such as positions −199 and −211, respectively, and continues to gradually increase through 60 h (Fig. 5, lane 6). These relative increases in band intensity at positions −198 and −210 are consistent and reproducible. Densitometric analysis of relative band intensities at positions −198 and −210 during 5aCdr reactivation is shown in Fig.6. Therefore, as seen with the −91 footprint, these data also indicate that the binding of transcription factors at positions −198 and −210 (most likely Sp1) occurs late in the process of 5aCdr-mediated reactivation (well after maximal levels of nuclease sensitivity have been achieved at 24–32 h) and correlates more closely in time with active transcription of the HPRT gene rather than alteration in the chromatin structure of the HPRT locus. In contrast, the site of enhanced DMS reactivity at position −163 in the GC box region does not exhibit a clear increase in intensity (relative to the adjacent band at position −164) during the course of 5aCdr reactivation (data not shown). This site is not as strongly footprinted in cells that express HPRT fully (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar), and the percentage of reactivated cells at any of the time points examined after 5aCdr treatment is relatively low. This is also true for the AP2 site and the remaining Sp1 sites. Therefore, the inability to demonstrate clear evidence of these footprints during 5aCdr reactivation most likely reflects limitations on the sensitivity of the in vivofootprinting assay at these sites. A graphical summary of the events following 5aCdr treatment of the inactive X hybrid is shown in Fig. 6, in which chromatin structure (nuclease sensitivity), transcription factor binding at positions −91, −198, and −210, and HPRT mRNA levels are plotted as a function of time after initiating 5aCdr treatment. The appearance of the −91, −198, and −210 footprints are correlated with the appearance of HPRT mRNA rather than with the earlier change in chromatin structure. This change in chromatin structure, therefore, does not require binding of a factor(s) to the −91 region, a region that is near the multiple sites of transcription initiation and in a location similar to regions previously reported to be critical for silencing other genes by DNA methylation (33Levine A. Cantoni G.L. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10119-10123Google Scholar, 34Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Riggs A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8252-8256Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that chromatin remodeling in response to 5aCdr treatment does not require transcription factor binding to multiple transcription factor binding sites in the HPRT promoter region. The 5aCdr-induced reactivation of the inactive X-linkedHPRT gene involves an initial hemi-demethylation of the promoter region that is associated with a change in chromatin from a nuclease-resistant to a nuclease-sensitive structure. After the alteration in chromatin structure, symmetrical demethylation occurs and HPRT mRNA appears (22Sasaki T. Hansen R.S. Gartler S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3819-3826Google Scholar). We show here that transcription factor binding to at least three sites in the promoter region is correlated with the appearance of HPRT mRNA rather than with the preceding remodeling of chromatin structure. From this sequence of events, we propose that the change in chromatin structure of the 5′ region as a result of 5aCdr treatment does not require transcription factor binding in the immediate promoter region (footprints associated with the −91, −198, and −210 sites). Reactivation of HPRT apparently requires a 5aCdr-induced remodeling of chromatin structure such that DNA binding sites in the promoter region become accessible to transcriptional activators. The binding of these activators, which are known to be present in the nucleus before 5aCdr treatment (and are bound to the active HPRT allele in female cells), would then affect further changes in chromatin structure of the promoter region that potentiate transcriptional activity (e.g. an alteration in the nucleosomal structure). The primary mechanism by which DNA methylation maintains the silence of theHPRT gene on the inactive X chromosome may therefore involve a role in organizing or stabilizing chromatin into a conformation that prevents the accessibility of transcriptional activators or otherwise precludes their binding to DNA. Although we were only able to analyze three of the seven sequence-specific footprints characteristic of the transcriptionally active HPRT gene (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar), reports by Martinez-Balbas et al. (35Martinez Balbas M.A. Dey A. Rabindran S.K. Ozato K. Wu C. Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Google Scholar) and Lee and Garrard (36Lee M.S. Garrard W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9166-9170Google Scholar) that nuclease hypersensitivity is independent of transcription factor binding suggests that if it were possible to analyze the remaining footprints, these would also appear after the induction of chromatin remodeling by 5aCdr treatment. It is possible that DNA-binding proteins not detected by our earlier DMSin vivo footprinting studies of the promoter region of the active and inactive HPRT alleles could be responsible for remodeling of chromatin structure in response to 5aCdr. However, recent DNase I in vivo footprinting of the human HPRTgene on the active and inactive X chromosome shows no evidence for sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions on the upper strand between positions −77 and −227 on the inactive allele, nor does it show additional footprints in regions not previously footprinted by DMS on the active allele (24Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Google Scholar). 2Y. Yu and T. P. Yang, manuscript in preparation. These DNase I studies are consistent with our original findings that only the GC boxes, AP2 site, and the transcription initiation region are bound by factors on the active HPRT allele and that no DNA-binding proteins are found on the inactive allele in this region (including methyl DNA-binding proteins). The same conclusions were reached by Pfeifer and Riggs (7Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Google Scholar) and Pfeifer et al. (15Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar) in similarin vivo footprinting studies of the X-linked humanPGK-1 gene using DMS and DNase I. It has been postulated that DNA methylation affects transcription by directly altering the interaction of DNA-binding regulatory proteins with their binding sites (37Eden S. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 255-259Google Scholar) or by altering chromatin structure and secondarily altering sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions (38Buschhausen G. Wittig B. Graessmann M. Graessmann A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1177-1181Google Scholar,39Keshet I. Lieman-Hurwitz J. Cedar H. Cell. 1986; 44: 535-543Google Scholar). Recent studies of high-resolution methylation patterns in the human HPRT gene and the human and mousePGK-1gene 5′ regions suggest that direct, methylation-induced alteration of sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions in the promoter region is unlikely to be the primary mechanism by which X-linked genes are silenced by DNA methylation. In these studies methylation patterns in the 5′ region of the human and mouse PGK-1 genes (15Pfeifer G.P. Tanguay R.L. Steigerwald S.D. Riggs A.D. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1277-1287Google Scholar, 16Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Google Scholar,34Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Hansen R.S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1419-1430Google Scholar, 40Litt M.D. Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6190-6199Google Scholar) reveal no strict correlation between methylated CpG dinucleotides and binding sites for transcriptional activators and no discernible conserved pattern of CpG methylation among the inactive alleles of these genes (other than a generally higher level of methylation compared with the active allele). In particular, the methylation pattern seen in the mousePGK-1 gene makes it unlikely that DNA methylation functions by directly modifying individual interactions between transcriptional activators and their DNA binding sites in the immediate promoter because only a single CpG dinucleotide is fully methylated on the inactive X chromosome (16Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Google Scholar). The results we report here support the concept that DNA methylation and demethylation primarily affect chromatin structure and secondarily (as a result of changes in chromatin structure) influence sequence-specific DNA-protein interactions of the promoter region within native chromatin.

https://openalex.org/W2077347620,"From Trypanosoma brucei, we identified ST-2, a protein complex that interacts with telomeric DNA and exhibits novel features. It binds specifically to the double-stranded telomere repeats (TTAGGG) and more tightly to the subtelomere 29-base pair elements that separate the telomere repeats from their proximal telomere-associated sequences. Interestingly, ST-2 showed still greater affinity for the G-rich strand of the telomere present either as an overhang or in a single-stranded form, but it exhibited the highest affinity for the G-rich strand of the subtelomere repeats. The binding characteristics of ST-2 are complementary to those of ST-1, a 39-kDa polypeptide we previously identified in T. brucei (Eid, J., and Sollner-Webb, B. (1995) Mol. Cell. Biol.15, 389–397) that binds preferentially to the C-rich strands of the subtelomere and telomere repeats. UV cross-linking revealed five polypeptides of ST-2 that bind directly to the G-rich strand of the DNA, one of which is phosphorylated. Furthermore, the presence of ST-1 is critical for ST-2 complex binding both to the G-rich strand and to the duplex DNA, evidently as part of the ST-2 complex. This indicates that when binding to the duplex subtelomere and telomere repeats, ST-2 may act as a protein bridge with its ST-1 subunit binding to the C-rich strand and its five other cross-linkable polypeptides binding to the G-rich strand. Such an association could serve to hold the genomic subtelomeric and telomeric sequences in a partially single-stranded configuration to facilitate the recombinational events in this region that are crucial to the parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1978007727,"Substance P as well as many other neuropeptides are synthesized as glycine-extended precursors and converted to the biologically active C-terminal amides by posttranslational modification. The final step of posttranslational processing is catalyzed by peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM). In a previous study, N-substituted homocysteine analogs were found to be potent inhibitors of PAM partially purified from conditioned medium of cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma CA-77 cells. These compounds, however, were only modest inhibitors of substance P production in cultured dorsal root ganglion cells, possibly because of poor cell penetration. Several ester derivatives of hydrocinnamoyl-phenylalanyl-homocysteine, one of the most potent PAM inhibitors, were prepared to increase the intracellular accessibility of these compounds. Hydrocinnamoyl-phenylalanyl-(S-benzoyl-homocysteine) benzyl ester was identified as the most potent compound, inhibiting substance P biosynthesis in dorsal root ganglion cells with an IC50of 2 μm. Inhibition of PAM resulted in a concomitant increase in the glycine-extended substance p (substance P-Gly) precursor peptide. In the presence of 3 μm benzyl ester derivative, the intracellular substance P-Gly level was 2.4-fold higher while the substance P level was 2.1-fold lower than the corresponding peptides in control cells. These results suggest that PAM inhibition represents an effective method for suppression of substance P biosynthesis and, therefore, may have therapeutic utility in conditions associated with elevated substance P levels.

Enzyme Microb. Technol. 1994; 16: 450-456Google Scholar). These neuropeptides are typically synthesized as glycine-extended precursors and converted to the mature peptides by a family of enzymes involved in posttranslational modifications, e.g. O-glycosylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, and hydroxylation, as well as in proteolytic processing,e.g. endoproteolysis and exoproteolysis (2Mains R.E.

PAM is localized in secretory granules and requires copper, ascorbate, and molecular oxygen for activity (2Mains R.E. Cullen E.I. May V. Eipper B.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Endocrinology. 1985; 116: 2497-2504Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that PAM is actually a bifunctional enzyme that contains two distinct enzymatic activities and catalyzes the C-terminal amidation in a sequential manner. The first enzyme, peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) (EC1.14.17.3), requires the cofactors for activity and catalyzes the peptidylglycine α-hydroxylation reaction while the second enzyme, peptidyl α-hydroxyglycine α-amidating lyase (PAL) (EC 4.3.2.5), converts the intermediate into an α-amidated peptide and glyoxylate (8Perkins S.N.

Yun H.-Y. Mains R.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 489-497Google Scholar). Among the glycine-extended neuropeptides examined, glycine-extended substance P (substance P-Gly) has been demonstrated to possess the highest affinity for PAM partially purified from conditioned medium of cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma CA-77 cells (12Tamburini P.P. Jones B.N. Consalvo A.P. Young S.D. Lovato S.J. Gilligan J.P. Wennogle L.P. Erion M. Jeng A.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 623-631Google Scholar). Substance P has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurogenic inflammation (13Helme R.D. Andrews P.V. Watson B.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1986; 66: 333-337Google Scholar,14Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Xu X.-J. Regul. Pept. 1993; 46: 165-173Google Scholar). For example, elevated levels of substance P have been observed during inflammation, and depletion of substance P by chronic treatment of animals with capsaicin has been shown to lessen the severity of the inflammatory response (15Tissot M. Pradelles P. Giroud J.P. Inflammation. 1988; 12: 25-35Google Scholar, 16Raychaudhuri A. Colombo C. Pastor G. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. Agents Actions. 1991; 34: 251-253Google Scholar, 17Gilligan J.P. Lovato S.J. Erion M.D. Jeng A.Y. Inflammation. 1994; 18: 285-292Google Scholar). Furthermore, substance P may also play a role in rheumatoid arthritis (18Levine J.D. Collier D.H. Basbaum A., I. Moskowitz M.A. Helms C.A. J. Rheumatol. 1985; 12: 406-411Google Scholar). It has been shown that substance P stimulates the release of collagenase and prostaglandin E2from synoviocytes, resulting in a loss of cartilage, development of lesions in the adjacent bone, and perpetuation of the inflammatory process in the arthritic joint (19Lotz M. Carson D.A. Vaughan J.H. Science. 1987; 235: 893-895Google Scholar). The involvement of substance P in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis has been further supported by the observations that the release of substance P from the dorsal horn of polyarthritic rats is significantly accelerated and that the severity of arthritis in rats is increased upon infusion of substance P into the knee joints (20Oku R. Satoh M. Takagi H. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 74: 315-319Google Scholar, 21Levine J.D. Clark R. Devor M. Helms C. Moskowitz M.A. Basbaum A.I. Science. 1984; 226: 547-549Google Scholar). Thus, suppression of substance P biosynthesis through PAM inhibition may be beneficial to diseases such as neurogenic inflammation and rheumatoid arthritis. Several inhibitors of PAM have been identified previously, including acetopyruvate (4Kizer J.S. Bateman Jr., R.C. Miller C.R. Humm J. Busby Jr., W.H. Youngblood W.W.

Most of these compounds inhibit PAM with IC50 or Ki values in the low micromolar to sub-millimolar range. Through mechanism-based inhibitor design, Zabriskie et al. (28Zabriskie T.M. Cheng H.

Since substance P-Gly and other glycine-extended neuropeptides have displayed affinities in the low micromolar concentrations for PAM (12Tamburini P.P. Jones B.N. Consalvo A.P. Young S.D. Lovato S.J.

Biochem. 1990; 185: 213-219Google Scholar), the compounds mentioned above are, therefore, relatively weak inhibitors and are not expected to alter the biosynthesis of the amidated neuropeptides significantly. In a previous study, N-substituted homocysteine analogs were found to be potent inhibitors of PAM partially purified from conditioned medium of cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma CA-77 cells (30Erion M.D. Tan J. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4430-4437Google Scholar). Studies in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, however, showed only modest inhibition of substance P biosynthesis with these compounds (30Erion M.D. Tan J. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4430-4437Google Scholar). Since PAM is localized in secretory granules, these results suggest that the inhibitors were not accessible to the intracellular compartment of the cells. In the present study, several ester derivatives of hydrocinnamoyl-phenylalanylhomocysteine, one of the most potent PAM inhibitors, were synthesized to improve the intracellular accessibility of these compounds. N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) were obtained from Aldrich. Substance P and substance P antiserum were products of Cambridge Research Biochemicals (Wilmington, DE).N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (Tes), catalase, and rabbit liver esterase were purchased from Sigma. Cytosine arabinoside and partially purified PAM were obtained from Upjohn (Kalamazoo, MI) and Unigene Laboratories (Fairfield, NJ), respectively. Hydrocinnamoyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-homocysteine (Compound 1) was synthesized as described previously (30Erion M.D. Tan J. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4430-4437Google Scholar). A general procedure for the synthesis of prodrug esters of Compound 1 is shown in Scheme FS1, using hydrocinnamoyl-l-phenylalanyl-d,l-homocysteine thiolactone (Compound 2) as a common intermediate. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover Uni-Melt apparatus.1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 300 MHz on a Varian XL-300 or Bruker AM300 spectrometer with either chloroform or methanol as internal standard. DCI-mass spectra were measured on a Hewlett-Packard model 5985B single quadrupole mass spectrometer retrofitted with a Vacumetrics (California) desorption chemical ionization accessory. Thermospray mass spectra were measured on the Vestec 201 Thermospray single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a HED (high energy dynode) detector. Electrospray mass spectra analysis was performed via loop injection using a Micromass Platform II mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). A suspension of 10 g oft-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-l-phenylalanine (37.7 mmol), 5.75 g of d,l-homocysteine thiolactone hydrochloride (37.6 mmol), and 5.75 g of HOBT hydrate in 300 ml of methylene chloride was cooled in an ice bath. Triethylamine (5.3 ml, 38.1 mmol) was added in 1-ml aliquots followed by 7.25 g (37.9 mmol) of EDCI. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 17 h. The solvent was then evaporated in vacuo, and 300 ml each of ether and water were added to the residue. The phases were separated, and the organic layer was washed twice with 200 ml of 0.1 n HCl and once with saturated NaHCO3. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate/magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to give 13.68 g of Boc-l-phenylalanyl-d,l- homocysteine thiolactone (99%) as a white foam. A solution of 2 g (5.5 mmol) of the above material and 5 ml (65 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid was stirred for 45 min. The reaction was diluted with toluene before the solvents were evaporated in vacuo to give the product as white foam. This material was then dissolved in 40 ml of methylene chloride, and triethylamine (1.3 ml, 9.3 mmol) was added in portions. The pH was monitored to make sure that the reaction was basic. To this mixture was added 824 mg of hydrocinnamic acid (5.5 mmol), 840 mg of HOBT hydrate (5.5 mmol), and 1.04 g (5.5 mmol) of EDCI. The mixture was stirred for 90 min. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was taken up in ethyl acetate and water. The resultant emulsion was filtered through celite, and the phases were separated. The organic layer was washed once with water, twice with 0.1 n HCl, and once with saturated NaHCO3. It was then dried over sodium sulfate/magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was evaporatedin vacuo. The resultant solid was dissolved in warm methylene chloride and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (25% ethyl acetate/hexane) to give 1.1 g (51% overall, 3 steps) of hydrocinnamoyl-l-phenylalanyl-d,l-homocysteine thiolactone as a white solid.

To 0.6 ml of dry benzyl alcohol was added 45 mg (2.0 mmol) of sodium. The mixture was heated to 130 °C and stirred until the sodium dissolved and cooled to room temperature. A solution of 480 mg of Compound 2 in 6 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran was added and stirred for 90 s. The mixture was quenched with 2 n HCl, diluted with water, and extracted three times with methylene chloride. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated in vacuo. The resulting oil was purified by flash chromatography using 35% ethyl acetate/hexane until the benzyl alcohol was eluted.

The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and then taken up in methylene chloride and water. The resulting emulsion was filtered through celite, and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride.

Using the same procedure as the preparation of Compound 5, 167 mg of 2-naphthoyl-l-phenylalanyl-d,l-homocysteine thiolactone was converted to the benzyl ester that was recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give 20 mg (10%) of the benzyl ester as a white solid (m.p. 144–150 °C).

PAM was partially purified from conditioned medium of cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma CA-77 cells by DEAE and Sephacryl 300 SF column chromatography (12Tamburini P.P. Jones B.N. Consalvo A.P. Young S.D. Lovato S.J. Gilligan J.P. Wennogle L.P. Erion M. Jeng A.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 267: 623-631Google Scholar). The enzyme assay was performed according to the method published previously (30Erion M.D. Tan J. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4430-4437Google Scholar). Briefly, PAM (13.5 milliunits) was pre-incubated with various concentrations of inhibitors in 150 mm Tes, pH 7.0, and 0.001% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 50 μl. An equal volume of a solution containing 4 μmsubstrate, N-dansyl-d-Tyr-Phe-Gly, and 6 mm ascorbate was added and incubated further for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 100 mmEDTA. The product,N-dansyl-d-Tyr-Phe-NH2, was separated from substrate by a C18 cartridge column on high pressure liquid chromatography and detected by a fluorimeter. The sensory neurons of DRG from 1- to 3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats [Tac:N(SD)fBR] were cultured as described previously (31Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 97-102Google Scholar). To suppress the growth of non-neuronal cells, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added during the second and third days of culture (32Thayer S.A. Perney T.M. Miller R.J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4089-4097Google Scholar). After 6 days in culture, cells were treated with or without PAM inhibitors for 1 day followed by incubation with 500 μm ascorbate overnight. Subsequently, the cells were washed with Ham's F-12 medium, extracted with 2m acetic acid, and centrifuged. The supernatant was lyophilized, redissolved in a buffer containing 0.001% Triton X-100 in 150 mm Tes, pH 7.0, and divided in two. One-half of the extract was used directly to quantitate substance P by a radioimmunoassay using substance P antiserum that recognizes substance P with an affinity 10,000-fold higher than that of substance P-Gly (29Jeng A.Y. Wong M. Lovato S.J. Erion M.D. Gilligan J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 185: 213-219Google Scholar). The other half was treated with 40 μg of partially purified PAM, 0.5 mg/ml catalase, 1 μm CuSO4, and 3 mm ascorbate in 150 mm Tes, pH 7.0, in a total volume of 35 μl for 2 h at room temperature to convert substance P-Gly to substance P. The amount of substance P in the latter sample, again measured by radioimmunoassay, was the sum of substance P and substance P-Gly in the cells. The substance P-Gly levels in sensory neurons were calculated by subtracting the amount of substance P in samples without PAM treatment from the corresponding samples treated with the enzyme. When the DRG cells were dissociated and grown one day in culture, both the neuronal cells and non-neuronal cells such as glial cells and fibroblasts were seen (results not shown). The growth of the non-neuronal cells could be suppressed almost entirely after treatment of the cells with cytosine arabinoside during the second and third days of culture, resulting in a nearly homogenous population of neuronal cells that were inter-connected with neurites (results not shown). The effects of PAM inhibitors on substance P biosynthesis were assessed using these cells. Compound 1 was previously found to be a potent PAM inhibitor in vitro, with an IC50 of 10 nm. However, this compound was not effective in suppressing the biosynthesis of substance P in DRG cells; only 25% inhibition was observed at 10 μm (Table I). The homocysteine moiety was absolutely required for inhibition of substance P production in these cells; no significant inhibition was obtained when it was replaced by cysteine (results not shown). Since compounds that contain a charged group, such as a carboxylic acid, frequently exhibit poor cell penetration, we attributed the large difference in the potencies between the in vitro isolated enzyme and the cell assays to the inability of Compound 1 to enter DRG cells. One approach to circumvent this problem was to increase the hydrophobicity of the compound by cyclizing the sulfhydryl group with the C-terminal carboxyl group. As expected, the resulting thiolactone (Compound 2) was inactive in the in vitro PAM assay since a free sulfhydryl group was necessary to coordinate the active site copper ion. Unfortunately, this compound only showed a slight improvement in the DRG cell assay; substance P biosynthesis was inhibited by 37% at 10 μm(Table I). Therefore, a number of prodrug esters of Compound 1 were synthesized. The methyl (Compound 3), butyl (Compound 4), and benzyl (Compound 5) esters were 200- to 500-fold weaker in potencies in thein vitro PAM assay when compared with the parent compound; their respective IC50 values were 2.3, 1.9, and 5.4 μm. In DRG cells, the prodrug esters inhibited substance P biosynthesis with increased potency. The results also indicate that increased hydrophobicity of the esterified group led to better cellular activity. For example, Compound 5 inhibited the production of substance P in DRG cells by 74% at 10 μm (Table I). The esters were expected to inhibit substance P biosynthesis after intracellular conversion to the corresponding carboxylates by esterase. Indeed, incubation of the prodrug ester 3 with rabbit liver esterase (10 units/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C produced the parent compound based on its potency in the in vitro PAM inhibition with an IC50 of 8 nm (results not shown), similar to that observed with Compound 1.Table IInhibition of substance P production in DRG cells by Compound 1 and its prodrug estersCompoundR1R2PAM assayDRG Cell AssayIC501-aThe IC50 values of the prodrug esters in the PAM assay are means of two experiments (<10% error).ConcentrationPercent inhibition1-bPercent inhibitions of substance P production in DRG cells are expressed as mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of substance P production was performed in the presence of 500 μM ascorbate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Compound 5 was selected for further modification. Its sulfhydryl group was replaced with thionicotinate (Compound 6), thioacetate (Compound 7), or thiobenzoate (Compound 8). These compounds were inactive in thein vitro PAM assay as expected. Surprisingly, Compound 6 showed a decreased activity in the DRG cell assay when compared with Compound 5 (Table I). Also, replacement with a thioacetate group did not result in an improved inhibition of substance P biosynthesis when compared with the results obtained with Compound 5. Compound 8 was the most potent in this series; it inhibited the production of substance P in DRG cells with an estimated IC50 of 2 μm(Fig. 1). In a previous study, Compound 9 was also identified to be a potent inhibitor of PAM in vitro, and it was more effective than Compound 1 in the DRG cell assay (Tables I and II). Using the same strategy as described in Table I, the benzyl ester derivative of Compound 9 (Compound 10) was synthesized. Unfortunately, this compound was less potent than its parent compound in the DRG cell assay (Table II). Therefore, optimization of this series of compounds was not pursued further.Table IIInhibition of substance P production in DRG cells by Compound 9 and its prodrug esterCompoundRPAM assayDRG Cell AssayIC502-aThe IC50 value of the prodrug ester in the PAM assay represents the mean of two experiments (<10% error).ConcentrationPercent inhibition2-bPercent inhibitions of substance P production in DRG cells are expressed as mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition of substance P production was performed in the presence of 500 μm ascorbate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of PAM inhibition on the relative abundance of substance P and its precursor substance P-Gly in DRG cells was investigated using Compound 8. As described previously (31Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 97-102Google Scholar), cultured DRG cells produce more substance P-Gly than substance P in the absence of exogenous ascorbate. Under this condition, PAM is not fully activated since ascorbate is required for reoxidation of the active site copper during substrate turnover. Addition of 500 μm ascorbate and incubation of the DRG cells overnight led to a change in the substance P-Gly to substance P ratio from 3.2 to 0.3 (Table III). Compound 8 at 3 μm significantly inhibited the conversion of substance P-Gly to substance P even in the presence of the reducing agent. The ratio of substance P-Gly to substance P in the DRG cells was 1.5, but the total amount of the two peptides was not significantly different from that obtained in control cells or cells treated with ascorbate overnight (Table III).Table IIIEffects of Compound 8 on the amidation of substance P-Gly in DRG cellsTreatmentSPSP-GlyTotalSP-Gly:SP ratiofmolControl74 ± 12240 ± 36320 ± 463.2Ascorbate230 ± 6668 ± 35300 ± 740.3Compound 8 + Ascorbate110 ± 12160 ± 34260 ± 451.5Results are mean ± S.E.

For example, a diet deficient in vitamin C has been shown to cause a 30-fold increase in the levels of glycine-extended gastrin with a concomitant 2-fold decrease in gastrin in extracts of guinea pig antra (35Hilsted L. Rehfeld J.F. Schwartz T.W. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 151-154Google Scholar). Likewise, chronic treatment with a copper chelatorN,N-diethyldithiocarbamate or its disulfide dimer disulfiram in rats produced a dose-dependent increase in glycine-extended α-melanotropin in the pituitary (36Mains R.E. Park L.P. Eipper B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11938-11941Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, treatment with disulfiram, but not withN,N-diethyldithiocarbamate, was effective in the reduction of α-melanotropin in rat pituitary neurointermediate lobe and cholecystokinin octapeptide in cerebral cortex (37Mueller G.P. Altarac M. Neuropeptides. 1995; 28: 333-340Google Scholar). Similar treatment with disulfiram in rats also resulted in increased levels of substance P-Gly in various areas of the brain, including preoptic area, medial basal hypothalamus, pons, medulla, and spinal cord (38Marchand J.E. Hershman K. Kumar M.S.A. Thompson M.L. Kream R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 264-273Google Scholar). However, these treatments may cause other nonspecific effects, since other enzymes such as dopamine β-hydroxylase, superoxide dismutase, and lysyl oxidase also require ascorbate and/or copper for activity (39Colombo G. Papadopoulos N.J. Ash D.E. Villafranca J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 71-80Google Scholar, 40Brenner M.C. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4664-4670Google Scholar, 41Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Google Scholar, 42Kagan H.M. Reddy V.B. Narasimhan N. Csiszar K. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 192: 100-121Google Scholar). Therefore, specific, potent inhibitors of PAM would be desirable to confirm these observations. The most potent PAM inhibitors discovered to date areN-substituted homocysteine analogs (30Erion M.D. Tan J. Wong M. Jeng A.Y. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4430-4437Google Scholar). These compounds were shown to inhibit PAM partially purified from conditioned medium of cultured rat medullary thyroid carcinoma CA-77 cells with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Despite their potent activity in the in vitro enzyme assay, the homocysteine analogs were only moderately effective in regulating the biosynthesis of substance P in cultured DRG cells. Since the poor inhibitory activity would be due to poor cell penetration, a number of prodrug esters of hydrocinnamoyl-phenylalanylhomocysteine were prepared to increase the intracellular accessibility of these compounds. Hydrocinnamoyl-phenylalanyl(S-benzoyl-homocysteine) benzyl ester (Compound 8) was identified as the most potent compound, inhibiting substance P biosynthesis in DRG cells with an estimated IC50 about 2 μm or 1.2 μg/ml (Fig. 1). Although this potency is sufficient to modulate the production of amidated peptides, it is surprising to note that the IC50value obtained in the DRG cell assay is somewhat higher than expected, considering the parent Compound 1 inhibited PAM with an IC50 of 10 nm in vitro. Several reasons may explain this observed discrepancy in the potencies obtained from the in vitro enzyme and cellular assays. It is possible that Compound 8 is still not optimal for penetration through the DRG cell membrane. Alternatively, the intracellular esterases in the DRG cells might not be effective in converting the prodrug ester to the active PAM inhibitor, or the compound may not be stable throughout the incubation period since dimerization of the compound did occur upon storage (results not shown). Third, since PAM is localized in secretory granules inside the cells, inhibitors would need to cross two membranes to access PAM. If the prodrug esters are converted to the active Compound 1 by intracellular esterases immediately after crossing the plasma membrane, the resulting compound would not be as effective in penetrating through the membrane of the secretory granules to inhibit PAM. Inhibition of an enzyme frequently results in an excessive accumulation of the precursor and/or up-regulation of the enzyme (43Li A.C. Tanaka R.D. Callaway K. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 781-796Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the precursor itself may exert biological effects similar to that of the mature product if a sufficient concentration of the precursor is reached to overcome its weak potency. Likewise, up-regulation of enzyme may normalize the biosynthesis of the mature product. Therefore, neither an excessive accumulation of the precursor nor up-regulation of the enzyme would provide the desired pharmacological effects expected for drug intervention. In the present study, a limited quantity of PAM in the scarce DRG cells did not permit an easy assessment of whether PAM was up-regulated in these cells after inhibition. Nevertheless, a significant decrease in the level of substance P in DRG cells after treatment with Compound 8 suggests indirectly that PAM up-regulation was not likely to have occurred. Furthermore, the fact that the total amount of substance P and its precursor, substance P-Gly, remained the same in the presence or absence of ascorbate or PAM inhibitor (Table III) supports the notion that substance P-Gly was not excessively accumulated during PAM inhibition. Thus, inhibition of the α-amidation process appears to be an effective strategy for suppression of substance P biosynthesis. The prodrug esters of PAM inhibitors described here may also be useful to assess the pathological role of other amidated peptides such as neuropeptide Y, a powerful stimulant of food intake (44Gerald C. Walker M.W. Criscione L. Gustafson E.L. Batzl-Hartmann C. Smith K.E. Vaysse P. Durkin M.M. Laz T.M. Linemeyer D.L. Schaffhauser A.O. Whitebread S. Hofbauer K.G. Taber R.I. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 168-171Google Scholar), whose precursor, glycine-extended neuropeptide Y, has also been shown to be recognized by PAM with high affinity (12Tamburini P.P. Jones B.N.

On the basis of deletion and chemical cross-linking analyses on subunit IV, we proposed that subunit IV is essential for CuB binding to subunit I and that it is present in a cleft between subunits I and III (Saiki, K., Nakamura, H., Mogi, T., and Anraku, Y. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 15336–15340).To extend previous studies, we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis for selected 16-amino acid residues in subunit IV to explore subunit-subunit interactions in bo-type ubiquinol oxidase. We found that only the replacement of Phe83 in helix III resulted in the reduction of the catalytic activity but that this did not significantly affect the UV-visible spectroscopic properties and the copper content. This suggests that individual amino acid substitutions, including the six invariant residues, are not enough to alter such properties of the metal centers. Extragenic suppressor mutations were isolated for the Phe83 → Ala mutation of subunit IV and identified as missense mutations in helices VII and VIII in subunit I. These observations provide further support for specific interactions of subunit IV with helix VII and/or VIII, the CuB binding domain, of subunit I and suggest that subunit IV functions as a domain-specific molecular chaperon in the oxidase complex.

In the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli, cytochrome bo-type ubiquinol oxidase (UQO) 1The abbreviations used are:UQOcytochromebo-type ubiquinol oxidase from E. colikbkilobase pair(s)SMsucrose monolaurate SM-1200Ni-NTANi-nitrilotriacetic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. is predominantly expressed under highly aerobic growth conditions (1Anraku Y.

FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 163-167Google Scholar). UQO consists of four different subunits (3Matsushita K. Patel L. Gennis R.B. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4889-4893Google Scholar, 4Kranz R.G. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10614-10621Google Scholar) that are encoded by the cyoABCDE operon (5Chepuri V. Lemieux L. Au D.C.-T. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11185-11192Google Scholar). Subunits I, II, and III (CyoB, CyoA, and CyoC, respectively) of UQO are homologous to the counterparts of mitochondrial and bacterial cytochrome coxidases, and thus UQO belongs to the heme-copper terminal oxidase superfamily (5Chepuri V. Lemieux L. Au D.C.-T. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11185-11192Google Scholar, 6Saraste M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1990; 23: 331-366Google Scholar). Subunit I binds all three redox metal centers, low spin heme b(cytochrome b563.5), high spin heme o(cytochrome o), and a copper ion (CuB) (7Nakamura H. Yamato I. Anraku Y. Lemieux L. Gennis R.B. J.

Ma J. Gennis R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Google Scholar). The latter two metal centers form the heme-copper binuclear center that serves as the catalytic center for dioxygen reduction and proton pumping. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that six invariant histidines in subunit I serve as the axial ligand of the metal centers and that a bundle of helices VI–VIII and X form a binding pocket for the binuclear center. Subunit II does not have any metal center but seems to provide the ubiquinol oxidation site (12Welter R. Gu L.-Q. Yu L. Yu C.-A. Rumbley J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28834-28838Google Scholar). Subunits III and IV can be removed from the UQO complex without loss of the catalytic activity (13Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Google Scholar); however, they are essential for the functional expression of the UQO complex (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). 2H. Nakamura, K. Saiki, T. Mogi, and Y. Anraku, unpublished data. 2H. Nakamura, K. Saiki, T. Mogi, and Y. Anraku, unpublished data. Subunit IV (CyoD), whose homologues can be found only in the bacterial terminal oxidases (5Chepuri V. Lemieux L. Au D.C.-T. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11185-11192Google Scholar, 14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar), is proposed to be located in a cleft between subunits I and III and to assist the CuB binding to subunit I (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of CyoD revealed that the functional domain is located in the C-terminal two-thirds (Val45–His109) containing helices II and III (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The cyoEgene, which presents at the 3′-end of the cyo operon, encodes heme O synthase, which supplies heme O specifically to the binuclear center of UQO (16Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Google Scholar).To extend previous studies on subunit IV (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar), we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify the functional amino acid residues that are involved in interactions between subunits I and IV. Subsequently, we isolated and characterized extragenic suppressor mutations for the defective subunit IV mutation, namely D-F83A. 3The designations for mutations make use of the standard one-letter abbreviations for amino acids. Thus, “D-F83A” signifies the mutant in which the phenylalanine at position 83 in CyoD (subunit IV) has been replaced by alanine. 3The designations for mutations make use of the standard one-letter abbreviations for amino acids. Thus, “D-F83A” signifies the mutant in which the phenylalanine at position 83 in CyoD (subunit IV) has been replaced by alanine. We found that extragenic mutations are located in transmembrane helices VII and VIII of subunit I. Thus, we conclude that subunit IV is in close vicinity to the CuBbinding site of subunit I and functions as a domain-specific molecular chaperon in the UQO complex.DISCUSSIONRecently, the crystal structures ofaa3-type cytochrome c oxidases have been solved at atomic resolution for the 4-subunit enzyme fromParacoccus denitrificans (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar) and for the 13-subunit enzyme from bovine heart (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar). Coordination chemistry of the redox metal centers revealed by molecular biological studies on bacterial enzymes (8Minagawa J. Mogi T. Gennis R.B. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Google Scholar) was confirmed by crystallographic efforts (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar, 23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar). This structural information provides us with new insights into the molecular mechanism of redox-coupled proton pumping. Subunits I and II are known to serve as the redox reaction centers in the oxidase complex, whereas the functional role of other small subunits remains obscured. The nuclear encoded “supernumeral” subunits of eukaryotic oxidases are unlikely to be involved in electron transfer or proton pumping (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar) but may serve as regulators of the cytochrome c oxidase activity through ATP binding and/or the switching of tissue-specific isoforms (24Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 570-574Google Scholar). Subunit III of bacterial cytochrome c oxidase has been suggested to be required for assembly of subunits I and II into an active complex (25Haltia T. Saraste M. Wikström M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2015-2021Google Scholar).Comparison of the bacterial subunit IV sequences indicates that helix I to the loop II/III is more conserved than the other portions; however, our deletion analysis of CyoD showed that the N-terminal one-third (i.e. the N terminus to the loop I/II) of subunit IV is dispensable in the catalytic function of UQO (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). CyoD was suggested to assist the binding of copper ions to the CuB site during the folding process of subunit I or assembly of the UQO complex (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that only a substitution of Phe83 in helix III reduced the catalytic activity without significant effects on the redox metal centers and the assembly of the UQO complex. Since Phe or Tyr is conserved at position 83, aromatic side chains at the cytoplasmic end of helix III may be crucial for folding of subunit IV or interaction with subunit I. Aromatic side chains on intrinsic membrane proteins are frequently found within membrane boundaries (26Cowan S.W. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1994; 264: 914-916Google Scholar) and may be stabilized by the choline head group of phospholipids through cation-π interactions (27Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar). Individual replacements of other conserved amino acid residues in subunit IV were not enough to alter subunit-subunit interactions; therefore, the functional role of subunit IV seems to be structural rather than enzymatic in contrast to CyoE (16Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Google Scholar, 17Saiki K. Mogi T. Hori H. Tsubaki M. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26927-26934Google Scholar).Recently, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was shown to be efficient for small scale purification to near homogeneity of the His-tagged UQO and cytochrome c oxidase fromRhodobacter sphaeroides (28Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 148-150Google Scholar) 5Recently, Gennis and co-workers demonstrated that Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was suitable for rapid purification of UQO when a His6 tag was placed at the C terminus of subunits I, II, and III (J. N. Rumbley, E. F. Nickels, and R. B. Gennis, unpublished data). and may be suitable for isolation of unstable mutant enzymes. UQO with the His-tagged CyoD was purified to ∼90 and 70% using small scale and large scale protocols, respectively (Fig. 3, Table III). However, it should be noted that an endogenous cation binding site in the C-terminal periplasmic domain of subunit II (29Warne A. Wang D.N. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 443-451Google Scholar) seems as efficient as the His tag introduced at the C terminus of CyoD (Fig. 3). Purification of the CyoD-deficient mutant oxidase by this method demonstrated that subunit IV is not required for the assembly of subunits I–III (ΔCyoD (ΔD5) in Fig. 3, lane 4). Based on the deletion and chemical cross-linking analyses on CyoD, we proposed previously that subunit IV is located in a cleft between subunits I and III (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar), similar to the four-subunit cytochrome c oxidase of P. denitrificans (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar). Specific interactions of helices II and III of subunit IV with subunit I has been suggested from a complete loss of the CuB center in the CyoD deletion mutants (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified the extragenic suppressor mutations for the D-F83A mutation in helices VII and VIII of subunit I (B-L326P, B-I357T, and B-V361M). It has been shown previously that helices VI, VII, and VIII of subunit I form the CuB binding pocket and contain the axial ligands for CuB (His284, His333, and His334) (8Minagawa J. Mogi T. Gennis R.B. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2096-2104Google Scholar, 9Lemieux L.J. Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Ingledew W.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2105-2113Google Scholar, 10Mogi T.

These results suggest the presence of direct interactions of subunit IV with subunit I.In conclusion, subunit IV is dispensable for enzyme activity (13Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Google Scholar) but is required for assembly of the oxidase complex into a catalytically active form through interactions with the CuB binding domain of subunit I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The cyoEgene, which presents at the 3′-end of the cyo operon, encodes heme O synthase, which supplies heme O specifically to the binuclear center of UQO (16Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Google Scholar). cytochromebo-type ubiquinol oxidase from E. coli kilobase pair(s) sucrose monolaurate SM-1200 Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid high performance liquid chromatography. To extend previous studies on subunit IV (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar), we carried out alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify the functional amino acid residues that are involved in interactions between subunits I and IV. Subsequently, we isolated and characterized extragenic suppressor mutations for the defective subunit IV mutation, namely D-F83A. 3The designations for mutations make use of the standard one-letter abbreviations for amino acids. Thus, “D-F83A” signifies the mutant in which the phenylalanine at position 83 in CyoD (subunit IV) has been replaced by alanine. 3The designations for mutations make use of the standard one-letter abbreviations for amino acids. Thus, “D-F83A” signifies the mutant in which the phenylalanine at position 83 in CyoD (subunit IV) has been replaced by alanine. We found that extragenic mutations are located in transmembrane helices VII and VIII of subunit I. Thus, we conclude that subunit IV is in close vicinity to the CuBbinding site of subunit I and functions as a domain-specific molecular chaperon in the UQO complex. DISCUSSIONRecently, the crystal structures ofaa3-type cytochrome c oxidases have been solved at atomic resolution for the 4-subunit enzyme fromParacoccus denitrificans (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar) and for the 13-subunit enzyme from bovine heart (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar). Coordination chemistry of the redox metal centers revealed by molecular biological studies on bacterial enzymes (8Minagawa J. Mogi T. Gennis R.B. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2096-2104Google Scholar, 9Lemieux L.J. Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Ingledew W.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2105-2113Google Scholar, 10Mogi T. Nakamura H. Anraku Y. J.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5587-5600Google Scholar) was confirmed by crystallographic efforts (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar, 23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar). This structural information provides us with new insights into the molecular mechanism of redox-coupled proton pumping. Subunits I and II are known to serve as the redox reaction centers in the oxidase complex, whereas the functional role of other small subunits remains obscured. The nuclear encoded “supernumeral” subunits of eukaryotic oxidases are unlikely to be involved in electron transfer or proton pumping (23Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H. Shinzawa-Itoh K. Nakashima R. Yaono R. Yoshikawa S. Science. 1996; 272: 1136-1144Google Scholar) but may serve as regulators of the cytochrome c oxidase activity through ATP binding and/or the switching of tissue-specific isoforms (24Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 570-574Google Scholar). Subunit III of bacterial cytochrome c oxidase has been suggested to be required for assembly of subunits I and II into an active complex (25Haltia T. Saraste M. Wikström M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2015-2021Google Scholar).Comparison of the bacterial subunit IV sequences indicates that helix I to the loop II/III is more conserved than the other portions; however, our deletion analysis of CyoD showed that the N-terminal one-third (i.e. the N terminus to the loop I/II) of subunit IV is dispensable in the catalytic function of UQO (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). CyoD was suggested to assist the binding of copper ions to the CuB site during the folding process of subunit I or assembly of the UQO complex (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis demonstrated that only a substitution of Phe83 in helix III reduced the catalytic activity without significant effects on the redox metal centers and the assembly of the UQO complex. Since Phe or Tyr is conserved at position 83, aromatic side chains at the cytoplasmic end of helix III may be crucial for folding of subunit IV or interaction with subunit I. Aromatic side chains on intrinsic membrane proteins are frequently found within membrane boundaries (26Cowan S.W. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1994; 264: 914-916Google Scholar) and may be stabilized by the choline head group of phospholipids through cation-π interactions (27Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar). Individual replacements of other conserved amino acid residues in subunit IV were not enough to alter subunit-subunit interactions; therefore, the functional role of subunit IV seems to be structural rather than enzymatic in contrast to CyoE (16Mogi T. Saiki K. Anraku Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 391-398Google Scholar, 17Saiki K. Mogi T. Hori H. Tsubaki M. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26927-26934Google Scholar).Recently, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was shown to be efficient for small scale purification to near homogeneity of the His-tagged UQO and cytochrome c oxidase fromRhodobacter sphaeroides (28Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 148-150Google Scholar) 5Recently, Gennis and co-workers demonstrated that Ni-NTA affinity chromatography was suitable for rapid purification of UQO when a His6 tag was placed at the C terminus of subunits I, II, and III (J. N. Rumbley, E. F. Nickels, and R. B. Gennis, unpublished data). and may be suitable for isolation of unstable mutant enzymes. UQO with the His-tagged CyoD was purified to ∼90 and 70% using small scale and large scale protocols, respectively (Fig. 3, Table III). However, it should be noted that an endogenous cation binding site in the C-terminal periplasmic domain of subunit II (29Warne A. Wang D.N. Saraste M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 443-451Google Scholar) seems as efficient as the His tag introduced at the C terminus of CyoD (Fig. 3). Purification of the CyoD-deficient mutant oxidase by this method demonstrated that subunit IV is not required for the assembly of subunits I–III (ΔCyoD (ΔD5) in Fig. 3, lane 4). Based on the deletion and chemical cross-linking analyses on CyoD, we proposed previously that subunit IV is located in a cleft between subunits I and III (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar), similar to the four-subunit cytochrome c oxidase of P. denitrificans (22Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar). Specific interactions of helices II and III of subunit IV with subunit I has been suggested from a complete loss of the CuB center in the CyoD deletion mutants (14Saiki K. Nakamura H. Mogi T. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15336-15340Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified the extragenic suppressor mutations for the D-F83A mutation in helices VII and VIII of subunit I (B-L326P, B-I357T, and B-V361M). It has been shown previously that helices VI, VII, and VIII of subunit I form the CuB binding pocket and contain the axial ligands for CuB (His284, His333, and His334) (8Minagawa J. Mogi T. Gennis R.B. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2096-2104Google Scholar, 9Lemieux L.J. Calhoun M.W. Thomas J.W. Ingledew W.J. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2105-2113Google Scholar, 10Mogi T.

These results suggest the presence of direct interactions of subunit IV with subunit I.In conclusion, subunit IV is dispensable for enzyme activity (13Kita K. Konishi K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3368-3374Google Scholar) but is required for assembly of the oxidase complex into a catalytically active form through interactions with the CuB binding domain of subunit I.
