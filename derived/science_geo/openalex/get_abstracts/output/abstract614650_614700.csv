https://openalex.org/W2884607428,"Many patients with advanced cancers achieve dramatic responses to a panoply of therapeutics yet retain minimal residual disease (MRD), which ultimately results in relapse. To gain insights into the biology of MRD, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing to malignant cells isolated from BRAF mutant patient-derived xenograft melanoma cohorts exposed to concurrent RAF/MEK-inhibition. We identified distinct drug-tolerant transcriptional states, varying combinations of which co-occurred within MRDs from PDXs and biopsies of patients on treatment. One of these exhibited a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) transcriptional program largely driven by the nuclear receptor RXRG. An RXR antagonist mitigated accumulation of NCSCs in MRD and delayed the development of resistance. These data identify NCSCs as key drivers of resistance and illustrate the therapeutic potential of MRD-directed therapy. They also highlight how gene regulatory network architecture reprogramming may be therapeutically exploited to limit cellular heterogeneity, a key driver of disease progression and therapy resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2883086294,"The ex vivo generation of platelets from human-induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) is expected to compensate donor-dependent transfusion systems. However, manufacturing the clinically required number of platelets remains unachieved due to the low platelet release from hiPSC-derived megakaryocytes (hiPSC-MKs). Here, we report turbulence as a physical regulator in thrombopoiesis in vivo and its application to turbulence-controllable bioreactors. The identification of turbulent energy as a determinant parameter allowed scale-up to 8 L for the generation of 100 billion-order platelets from hiPSC-MKs, which satisfies clinical requirements. Turbulent flow promoted the release from megakaryocytes of IGFBP2, MIF, and Nardilysin to facilitate platelet shedding. hiPSC-platelets showed properties of bona fide human platelets, including circulation and hemostasis capacities upon transfusion in two animal models. This study provides a concept in which a coordinated physico-chemical mechanism promotes platelet biogenesis and an innovative strategy for ex vivo platelet manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2882990300,"Summary Melanopsin is expressed in distinct types of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which drive behaviors from circadian photoentrainment to contrast detection. A major unanswered question is how the same photopigment, melanopsin, influences such vastly different functions. Here we show that melanopsin’s role in contrast detection begins in the retina, via direct effects on M4 ipRGC (ON alpha RGC) signaling. This influence persists across an unexpectedly wide range of environmental light levels ranging from starlight to sunlight, which considerably expands the functional reach of melanopsin on visual processing. Moreover, melanopsin increases the excitability of M4 ipRGCs via closure of potassium leak channels, a previously unidentified target of the melanopsin phototransduction cascade. Strikingly, this mechanism is selective for image-forming circuits, as M1 ipRGCs (involved in non-image forming behaviors), exhibit a melanopsin-mediated decrease in excitability. Thus, melanopsin signaling is repurposed by ipRGC subtypes to shape distinct visual behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2884166108,"The enhancer landscape of pluripotent stem cells undergoes extensive reorganization during early mammalian development. The functions and mechanisms behind such reorganization, however, are unclear. Here, we show that the transcription factor GRHL2 is necessary and sufficient to activate an epithelial subset of enhancers as naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) transition into formative epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs). Surprisingly, many GRHL2 target genes do not change in expression during the ESC-EpiLC transition. Instead, enhancers regulating these genes in ESCs diminish in activity in EpiLCs while GRHL2-dependent alternative enhancers become activated to maintain transcription. GRHL2 therefore assumes control over a subset of the naive network via enhancer switching to maintain expression of epithelial genes upon exit from naive pluripotency. These data evoke a model where the naive pluripotency network becomes partitioned into smaller, independent networks regulated by EpiLC-specific transcription factors, thereby priming cells for lineage specification."

Found in organisms as disparate as Arabidopsis, Drosophila, Synechococcus, and humans, these daily oscillations occur at molecular, cellular, and systems levels, ultimately entraining an organism to environmental cycles (Dunlap, 1999Dunlap J.C. Molecular bases for circadian clocks.Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar). Dysregulation in the circadian system, also known as chronodisruption, is associated with a variety of physiological maladies in humans including diabetes, cancer, insomnia, and affective disorders (McClung, 2011McClung C.A.

Understanding how cellular circadian oscillators integrate environmental signals, communicate with each other, and entrain to their environment is key to preventing and treating chronodisruption. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a master circadian pacemaker, which detects local light input through retinal release of glutamate and PACAP (Ding et al., 1997Ding J.M. Faiman L.E. Hurst W.J.

Located in the ventral hypothalamus, the approximately 20,000 GABAergic neurons comprising the SCN are unique in that many express self-sustained and spontaneously synchronizing circadian rhythms in firing activity and gene expression (Cassone et al., 1993Cassone V.M.

These rhythms are maintained through a near-24 hr transcription-translation feedback loop of core clock genes including Bmal1, Clock, Period1 and 2 (Per1 and 2), and Cryptochrome1 and 2 (Ko and Takahashi, 2006Ko C.H.

Transcriptional architecture of the mammalian circadian clock.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2017; 18: 164-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Recently, researchers have shown that electrical stimulation of all SCN neurons was sufficient to phase shift and entrain circadian rhythms in gene expression and behavior (Jones et al., 2015Jones J.R. Tackenberg M.C. McMahon D.G. Manipulating circadian clock neuron firing rate resets molecular circadian rhythms and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, it is poorly understood how firing activity and neurotransmission from specific cell types within the SCN contribute to entrainment. Although uniformly GABAergic (Moore and Speh, 1993Moore R.Y. Speh J.C. GABA is the principal neurotransmitter of the circadian system.Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 150: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), SCN neurons vary significantly in their neuropeptide content (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001Abrahamson E.E. Moore R.Y. Suprachiasmatic nucleus in the mouse: retinal innervation, intrinsic organization and efferent projections.Brain Res. 2001; 916: 172-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). One anatomically and functionally distinct class of neurons expresses vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Though neurons expressing VIP only make up approximately 10% of SCN neurons (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001Abrahamson E.E. Moore R.Y. Suprachiasmatic nucleus in the mouse: retinal innervation, intrinsic organization and efferent projections.Brain Res. 2001; 916: 172-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), VIP neuron projections densely innervate the SCN and the majority of SCN neurons express its receptor VPAC2 (An et al., 2012An S. Tsai C. Ronecker J. Bayly A. Herzog E.D. Spatiotemporal distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 2 in mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2012; 520: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Functionally, genetic loss of VIP or VPAC2R weakens synchrony among SCN neurons and dramatically reduces circadian rhythms in the SCN and in behavior (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S.

Biol. 2006; 16: 599-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Additionally, exogenous application of VIP increases GABAergic neurotransmission (Reed et al., 2002Reed H.E. Cutler D.J. Brown T.M. Brown J. Coen C.W. Piggins H.D. Effects of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide on neurones of the rat suprachiasmatic nuclei in vitro.J.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and phase shifts daily rhythms in the SCN and locomotor activity (An et al., 2011An S. Irwin R.P. Allen C.N. Tsai C. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide requires parallel changes in adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C to entrain circadian rhythms to a predictable phase.J.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5612-5622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With the development of Cre-lox technology allowing cell-type-specific manipulation of SCN neurons, researchers found that VIP neurons have sparse GABAergic monosynaptic connections to approximately 50% of SCN neurons (Fan et al., 2015Fan J. Zeng H. Olson D.P. Huber K.M. Gibson J.R. Takahashi J.S. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus provide sparse GABAergic outputs to local neurons with circadian regulation occurring distal to the opening of postsynaptic GABAA ionotropic receptors.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 1905-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite the important role VIP plays in circadian function, we do not know how VIP is released from SCN neurons other than that it is stored within dense core vesicles (Castel et al., 1996Castel M. Morris J. Belenky M. Non-synaptic and dendritic exocytosis from dense-cored vesicles in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The release of neuropeptides has been studied primarily in large neuromuscular synapses and hippocampal neurons where firing rates in excess of 50 Hz have been associated with release (Pécot-Dechavassine and Brouard, 1997Pécot-Dechavassine M. Brouard M.O. Large dense-core vesicles at the frog neuromuscular junction: characteristics and exocytosis.J. Neurocytol. 1997; 26: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, Xia et al., 2009Xia X. Lessmann V. Martin T.F.J. Imaging of evoked dense-core-vesicle exocytosis in hippocampal neurons reveals long latencies and kiss-and-run fusion events.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, SCN neurons fire at sustained rates that rarely exceed 15 Hz (Welsh et al., 1995Welsh D.K. Logothetis D.E. Meister M. Reppert S.M. Individual neurons dissociated from rat suprachiasmatic nucleus express independently phased circadian firing rhythms.Neuron. 1995; 14: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unclear what role, if any, firing activity in VIP neurons plays in neuropeptide release and circadian entrainment. To address whether increases in VIP neuronal firing frequency mediate circadian entrainment, we took a multi-step approach. We first characterized the spontaneous, daily firing frequencies and patterns of VIP neurons. We then stimulated VIP neurons, comparing the effects of different firing frequencies on daily rhythms in vivo and in vitro. Single SCN neurons exhibit changes in spontaneous firing activity across the circadian day that can vary dramatically in frequency and firing pattern. It is not known whether these electrophysiological characteristics relate to cell-intrinsic properties like neuropeptide release. Therefore, we designed our experiment to characterize firing activity of neuropeptidergic VIP SCN neurons by recording from single neurons across multiple days. To do so, we optically tagged VIP neurons within SCN cultures plated on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). Specifically, following multiday spontaneous activity recordings, we activated channelrhodpsin-2 (ChR2) expressed solely within VIP neurons (VIP-IRES-Cre crossed with floxed-ChR2; STAR Methods) using blue light pulses (Figure 1A). We identified 9.1% ± 2.4% (mean ± SEM) of recorded neurons as VIP neurons because they had an interspike interval histogram (ISIH) during the 1 hr stimulation that matched the stimulation pattern (Figure 1B). We then cross-correlated firing between each pair of activated neurons and found they reliably fired synchronously in response to stimulation. These VIP neurons contrasted with neurons that either did not change or decreased their firing approximately 10–20 ms following stimulation, consistent with inhibitory neurotransmission from VIP SCN neurons (Figure 1C). We next characterized the spontaneous activity of VIP and non-VIP neurons. Overall, we discriminated multiday electrical activity from 42 VIP neurons and 540 non-VIP neurons across 10 MEA preparations. Two prior reports both measured firing for 1–30 min at two times of day (Fan et al., 2015Fan J. Zeng H. Olson D.P. Huber K.M. Gibson J.R. Takahashi J.S. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus provide sparse GABAergic outputs to local neurons with circadian regulation occurring distal to the opening of postsynaptic GABAA ionotropic receptors.J.

Distinct firing properties of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2016; 31: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but differed on whether VIP SCN neurons have circadian firing rhythms. By following individual VIP neurons across multiple days, we found that a majority had circadian firing activity (81.9% ± 6.2%; Figures 1D and 1E). After optical tagging, we verified that a subset of SCN neurons expressed ChR2-eYFP (Figure 1F), consistent with VIP-neuron-specific recombination (Brancaccio et al., 2013Brancaccio M. Maywood E.S. Chesham J.E. Loudon A.S.I. Hastings M.H.

Distinct firing properties of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2016; 31: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Parallel whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in slices and MEA recordings from dissociated cultures revealed that only ChR2-positive SCN neurons fired within 5 ms after light flashes (Figure S1). In conclusion, optical tagging reliably identified the multiday circadian firing of VIP SCN neurons. Most electrophysiological SCN studies have focused on circadian changes in SCN neuronal firing rate (the number of spikes in bins ranging from 10 s to 10 min; Figure 1D). Because neurotransmitter release occurs on millisecond timescales, we instead elected to analyze instantaneous spike timing and frequency of circadian SCN neurons (36 VIP and 302 non-VIP). Based on the spike timing of spontaneous activity during an individual neuron’s peak daily firing, we observed three distinct classes of spike timing within SCN neurons: tonic, irregular, and bursting (Figure S2), similar to those previously described (Pennartz et al., 1998Pennartz C.M. De Jeu M.T. Geurtsen A.M. Sluiter A.A. Hermes M.L. Electrophysiological and morphological heterogeneity of neurons in slices of rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Physiol. 1998; 506: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the ISIH and dominant instantaneous firing rate (DIFR) revealed that VIP neurons could be classified as having either tonic or irregular spike timing (Figure 2A), whereas non-VIP neurons were tonic, were irregular, or exhibited short bursts of firing greater than 50 Hz (Figures 2B and 2C). The DIFR did not differ between tonic and irregular VIP or non-VIP neurons, but distinguished the bursting non-VIP neurons of the SCN (Figure 2D). Strikingly, individual SCN neurons did not change their stereotyped spike timing (tonic, irregular, or bursting) with time of day, or across multiple days, including during periods of rapidly increasing or decreasing firing activity (Figure 2E). We found two comparable classes when analyzing intracellular recordings from VIP neurons in adult SCN slices (Figures 2F–2H; data originally collected in Hermanstyne et al., 2016Hermanstyne T.O. Simms C.L. Carrasquillo Y. Herzog E.D. Nerbonne J.M. Distinct firing properties of vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2016; 31: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These results indicate that VIP SCN neurons are circadian and, despite dynamic fluctuations in their mean firing rate, can be classified as either tonic or irregular spiking independent of time of day over multiple days. To test how VIP neuronal firing influences circadian entrainment, we optogenetically stimulated VIP neurons with one of two firing frequencies that represent their high- and low-frequency ranges: high instantaneous frequency (HIF, doublets of 20 Hz at 2 Hz) or low instantaneous frequency (LIF, tonic 4 Hz; Figures 3A and 3B ). These activation patterns evoked the same number of spikes per second (4 Hz), but differed in their spike timing for the duration of the 1 hr of stimulation (Figure S3). We found that HIF, but not LIF, shifted circadian gene expression in SCN slices. Briefly, we cultured SCN explants expressing ChR2 in VIP neurons and Period2::Luciferase (PER2::LUC, a knockin fusion that reports PER2 protein abundance) or littermate controls lacking ChR2 expression. Following baseline bioluminescence recording of PER2 levels from the entire SCN, we stimulated all SCN for 1 hr near the peak of PER2 expression (circadian time, CT 9–12) with HIF or LIF patterns. We chose to stimulate at this time because it has been reported as the time when exogenous VIP application evoked large delays in PER2 rhythms (An et al., 2011An S. Irwin R.P. Allen C.N. Tsai C. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide requires parallel changes in adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C to entrain circadian rhythms to a predictable phase.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). HIF stimulation significantly delayed the daily rhythms of SCN PER2 expression by over 1.5 hr, whereas LIF stimulation did not (Figures 3C and 3D). Additionally, three consecutive days of stimulation yielded similar results (Figure S4). Thus, firing of VIP neurons can phase delay circadian gene expression, but only if stimulated at sufficiently high frequencies. To test whether VIP neuronal stimulation causes VIP release, we engineered sensor cells to measure VIP following HIF or LIF optogenetic stimulation (Figure S5). We found that acute HIF activation more potently increased VIP release than acute LIF stimulation. Critically, we found that 10 μM VPAC2R antagonist applied during HIF stimulation reduced the resulting phase shift in SCN explants expressing ChR2 in VIP neurons (Figures 3E and 3F). Thus, our data suggest that HIF firing of VIP neurons releases VIP, which phase delays circadian gene expression. Although VIP neuronal cell bodies localize to the ventral SCN, VPAC2 receptor is expressed in nearly all SCN neurons (An et al., 2012An S. Tsai C. Ronecker J. Bayly A. Herzog E.D. Spatiotemporal distribution of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 2 in mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Comp. Neurol. 2012; 520: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, King et al., 2003King V. Chahad-Ehlers S. Shen S. Harmar A. Maywood E. Hastings M. A hVIPR transgene as a novel tool for the analysis of circadian function in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 17: 822-832Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistent with these anatomical data, we found that activation of VIP neurons in vivo increases cFOS protein throughout the SCN. Briefly, freely moving mice expressing ChR2 in VIP neurons (VIPChR2) and littermate controls received blue laser light via an implanted fiber optic cannula aimed at the SCN. After 1 hr of 15 Hz stimulation at CT 13, 88.9% ± 4.0% (mean ± SEM, n = 4 mice; Figure 4A) of VIP neurons expressed cFOS, a marker of neuronal activation. Furthermore, cFOS expression increased roughly 5-fold in the ventral SCN and almost 4-fold in the dorsal SCN (Figure 4B) compared to controls. We conclude that high-frequency in vivo stimulation of VIP neurons both increases activity within VIP neurons and activates the whole SCN. Next, we found that firing of VIP neurons underlies their role in circadian entrainment. Briefly, we monitored wheel-running activity before, during, and after stimulation of VIP SCN neurons in vivo from enucleated mice (to block ambient light input) implanted with a fiber optic directed at the SCN. Before stimulation, all mice showed similar free-running circadian rhythms in locomotion (23.4 ± 0.1 hr, VIPChR2; 23.4 ± 0.2 hr, control; mean ± SEM, n = 7 and 4). Mice then received daily HIF stimulation for 1 hr for up to 30 days and only VIP-ChR2 mice entrained to the stimulation (Figure 5A). We calculated a phase response curve (Figure 5B) and found that stimulation of VIP neurons between CT 8 and 18 led to phase delays and entrainment. Ten Hertz activation of VIP SCN neurons for 1 hr at the same time each day similarly entrained circadian locomotor behavior (Figure S6). Additionally, we observed that stimulation of VIP neurons acutely suppressed wheel running (Figures 5C and 5D) similar to light-induced masking of locomotion. Finally, we found that firing frequency of VIP SCN neurons plays a role in the rate of circadian entrainment. Mice were randomly assigned to receive 1 hr of either daily HIF or LIF stimulation for 4–10 consecutive days. We found that either stimulation frequency entrained locomotor activity (Figure 6C); however, HIF stimulation entrained the mice more rapidly (Figures 6A and 6B). We conclude that firing of VIP neurons results in circadian entrainment and the frequency of firing determines the speed of entrainment. We consistently found that VIP SCN neurons fired with either tonic or irregular patterns in extracellular, multiday- and intracellular, acute-slice recordings. We hypothesize that these firing classes relate to two functional classes of VIP SCN neurons, in agreement with two prior anatomical studies that postulated two groups of VIP SCN neurons based on their differential, light-evoked Period1 gene expression (Kawamoto et al., 2003Kawamoto K. Nagano M. Kanda F. Chihara K. Shigeyoshi Y. Okamura H. Two types of VIP neuronal components in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 74: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and developmental expression of Vip mRNA (Ban et al., 1997Ban Y. Shigeyoshi Y. Okamura H. Development of vasoactive intestinal peptide mRNA rhythm in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3920-3931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these may represent VIP neurons that project either within or outside the SCN (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001Abrahamson E.E. Moore R.Y. Suprachiasmatic nucleus in the mouse: retinal innervation, intrinsic organization and efferent projections.Brain Res. 2001; 916: 172-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Similar subgroups of brainstem serotonergic neurons have been associated, for example, with regulating distinct behaviors including respiration and aggression through distinct brain target areas (Niederkofler et al., 2016Niederkofler V. Asher T.E. Okaty B.W. Rood B.D. Narayan A. Hwa L.S. Beck S.G. Miczek K.A. Dymecki S.M. Identification of serotonergic neuronal modules that affect aggressive behavior.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 1934-1949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Future studies should elucidate whether the physiological classes of VIP and non-VIP neurons map to specific anatomical groups within the SCN and targets outside the SCN. Our results suggest that the firing frequency of VIP neurons mediates circadian entrainment. Higher firing frequencies (HIF versus LIF) result in increased VIP release, larger phase shifts of the SCN, and faster circadian entrainment. This optogenetic stimulation produces phase shifts consistent with the magnitude and timing of VIP-induced shifts in vitro (An et al., 2011An S. Irwin R.P. Allen C.N. Tsai C. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide requires parallel changes in adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C to entrain circadian rhythms to a predictable phase.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2289-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Pantazopoulos et al., 2010Pantazopoulos H. Dolatshad H. Davis F.C. Chronic stimulation of the hypothalamic vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor lengthens circadian period in mice and hamsters.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2010; 299: R379-R385Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, Piggins et al., 1995Piggins H.D. Antle M.C. Rusak B. Neuropeptides phase shift the mammalian circadian pacemaker.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5612-5622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, while lower firing frequencies fail to phase shift gene expression in vitro, LIF stimulation ultimately entrains locomotor activity in vivo, though at a slower rate than HIF stimulation. This may reflect the cumulative effects of daily LIF activity, which can eventually entrain in vivo, but produces shifts that are too small to measure reliably in vitro. In addition, LIF stimulation likely alters the release of other SCN neurotransmitters including GABA and AVP differently than HIF stimulation. In vivo, these other neurotransmitters may play a crucial role in entrainment, likely through their actions on downstream brain areas. For example, GABA and AVP signaling in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) may modulate glucocorticoid release, which, in turn, can influence rates of entrainment (Buijs et al., 1998Buijs R.M. Hermes M.H. Kalsbeek A. The suprachiasmatic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus interactions: a bridge to the neuroendocrine and autonomic nervous system.Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 119: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Ultimately, the firing frequencies observed within VIP neurons and required for VIP-mediated phase shifting are on average 5-fold lower than frequencies that cause neuropeptide release in other neuropeptidergic neurons (Iverfeldt et al., 1989Iverfeldt K. Serfözö P. Diaz Arnesto L. Bartfai T.

These findings provide a new view of the neural architecture for social communication and suggest expressive orofacial movements generated by lateral premotor cortex as a putative evolutionary precursor to human speech. As a rule, animals do not speak. However, all primates communicate, making prominent use of vocalizations and facial expressions. Facial expressions likely derived from evolutionary ritualization of noncommunicative postures indicative of arousal, aggressive or defensive movements, and ingestive actions (Andrew, 1963Andrew R.J. Evolution of facial expression.Science. 1963; 142: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and, as Charles Darwin famously noted, reveal otherwise hidden internal emotional states to others (Darwin, 1872Darwin C. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. John Murray, Albemarle Street, London1872Crossref Google Scholar). As such, facial expressions form an important category of visual signals in primate societies (van Hooff, 1967van Hooff J.A.R.A.M. The facial displays of the catarrhine monkeys and apes.in: Morris D. Primate Ethology. 2006 Edition. Wiedenfeld & Nicolson, London1967: 7-68Google Scholar). To function as communicative signals, facial expressions must be perceived by a receiver; interpreted; and, at times, answered by a response. Because of their role in communication, facial expressions are more likely to be produced when there is an audience (Fernández-Dols and Crivelli, 2013Fernández-Dols J.-M. Crivelli C. Emotion and expression: naturalistic studies.Emot. Rev. 2013; 5: 24-29Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and thus depend on the sender’s awareness of social context. Despite their importance for emotional processing, communication, and social coordination, little is known about the neural circuits controlling facial expressions and their relationship to circuits of face recognition and social cognition. Social perception, in the visual domain, relies on face recognition. Face recognition is supported by a network of selectively interconnected temporal and prefrontal face areas with unique functional specializations (Moeller et al., 2008Moeller S. Freiwald W.A.

Although some of the outputs of the system are known, how outputs from this system are used for subsequent behavior remains unknown. In particular, how the face-perception system relays information to facial motor areas during social communication is not understood. An important clue to this question is that facial expression exchange is partly reflexive. For example, humans (Dimberg et al., 2000Dimberg U. Thunberg M. Elmehed K. Unconscious facial reactions to emotional facial expressions.Psychol. Sci. 2000; 11: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1185) Google Scholar) and perhaps macaques (Mosher et al., 2011Mosher C.P. Zimmerman P.E. Gothard K.M. Videos of conspecifics elicit interactive looking patterns and facial expressions in monkeys.Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 125: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) automatically mimic expressions, much as both primate species automatically follow gaze (Shepherd, 2010Shepherd S.V. Following gaze: gaze-following behavior as a window into social cognition.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 5PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that dedicated feedforward pathways may link these percepts to their respective reflexive responses. A major output of the face-perception network is the basolateral amygdala (Moeller et al., 2008Moeller S. Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Patches with links: a unified system for processing faces in the macaque temporal lobe.Science. 2008; 320: 1355-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The basolateral amygdala is also a major input into anterior cingulate facial motor area M3 (Morecraft et al., 2004Morecraft R.J. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Rossing W.R. The motor cortex and facial expression: new insights from neuroscience.Neurologist. 2004; 10: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Morecraft et al., 2007Morecraft R.J. McNeal D.W. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Gedney M. Ge J. Schroeder C.M. van Hoesen G.W. Amygdala interconnections with the cingulate motor cortex in the rhesus monkey.J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 134-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Area M3, in turn, projects directly to the facial nucleus (Morecraft et al., 2004Morecraft R.J. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Rossing W.R. The motor cortex and facial expression: new insights from neuroscience.Neurologist. 2004; 10: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which harbors motor neurons directly controlling facial musculature. It is thus a plausible hypothesis that face-perception circuits drive emotional facial expressions in a feedforward circuit from the face-perception areas through the amygdala to the anterior cingulate cortex. The central role this hypothesis ascribes to area M3 is in line with results from human neuropsychology, which has found a double dissociation between medial and lateral cortical areas in facial motor control. Although lesions to medial frontal cortex impair affective expressions and vocalizations, lesions to lateral frontal cortex impair voluntary gestures and speech (Hopf et al., 1992Hopf H.C. Müller-Forell W. Hopf N.J. Localization of emotional and volitional facial paresis.Neurology. 1992; 42: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Morecraft et al., 2004Morecraft R.J.

Hage and Nieder, 2016Hage S.R. Nieder A. Dual neural network model for the evolution of speech and language..Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 813-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Despite the line of continuity between human and non-human expressions, human language has been argued to lack clear precedent in orofacial communication. Specifically, it has been argued that orofacial communication in non-human primates is too reflexive and simple to constitute precursors of speech and that speech instead must derive from ape innovations in gesture and simulation (e.g., see Arbib, 2005Arbib M.A. From monkey-like action recognition to human language: an evolutionary framework for neurolinguistics.Behav. Brain Sci. 2005; 28 (discussion 125–167): 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). This reasoning suggests the hypothesis that emotional communications are shared with animals and mediated by medial frontal and subcortical structures, and volitional communication is unique to humans and mediated by lateral (and lateralized) structures (e.g., for vocal behavior; Wheeler and Fischer, 2012Wheeler B.C. Fischer J. Functionally referential signals: a promising paradigm whose time has passed.Evol. Anthropol. 2012; 21: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, unlike vocalizations, the neural substrates of primate facial expressions have received almost no attention from neuroscientists—thus, the basic assumption of this hypothesis has not been tested, and the cortical substrates for naturalistic primate communication remain uncertain. Once produced, facial expressions serve a communicative function only when there is an audience. Interestingly, social context impacts the production of human facial expressions: more are produced when there is an audience (Fernández-Dols and Crivelli, 2013Fernández-Dols J.-M. Crivelli C. Emotion and expression: naturalistic studies.Emot. Rev. 2013; 5: 24-29Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Communication thus takes place in the so-called second-person context, in which the perceived individual is interacting with the subject. Second-person contexts, it has been argued, elicit fundamentally different cognitive processes than the third-person contexts (the noninteractive observation of others) which have been traditionally used in cognitive science (Mosher et al., 2011Mosher C.P.

Sci. 2016; 371: 20150081Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Crucially, it is these understudied second-person contexts for which social communication evolved. Therefore, the study of social communication provides an opportunity to identify the neural circuits of second-person cognition and their relationship to the circuits of social signal production. The minimal instantiating condition for second-person contexts is a sense of mutual perception: we therefore simulated second-person interactions in a controlled “minimal interaction” behavioral framework, testing the hypothesis that these contexts activate circuits specialized for coordinating interactions. Thus, to understand the neural processing of facial expression production, we need to understand the functional organization of facial motor circuits, their interaction with facial perception circuits, and their sensitivity to second-person context. Using a novel experimental approach, we aimed to address the following questions: What is the functional organization of face motor areas? In particular, are facial expressions generated by medial cortical areas and voluntary face movements by lateral ones? What is the functional relationship between face perception and face motor circuits? Does second-person context facilitate the generation of facial expressions, and how is it represented in the brain? We tackled these questions with two innovations. First, we adapted whole-brain fMRI, which had been so successful unraveling the functional organization of the face-perception network, to the domain of social communication. Second, we developed a paradigm for eliciting social facial movements from macaques within the MR scanner. This allowed us to image neural activity across the brain during social perception, during second- and third-person social information processing, and during social signal production (Figure 1). The paradigm utilized videos of monkeys’ dynamic facial displays taken from three angles (Figures 1B and S1A; see STAR Methods): two from either side of the interaction (generating a third-person perspective) and one from the front, simulating direct eye contact (generating a second-person perspective). Showing the same facial movements from different directions kept all intrinsic properties of the real-world scene identical but changed its social relevance to the subject (Schilbach et al., 2006Schilbach L. Wohlschlaeger A.M. Kraemer N.C. Newen A. Shah N.J. Fink G.R. Vogeley K. Being with virtual others: neural correlates of social interaction.Neuropsychologia. 2006; 44: 718-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). As a low-level perceptual control, we also generated videos with systematically phase-scrambled frames, preserving spectral content and motion but destroying shapes. During video presentation, monkeys seated in a scanner (Figure 1C) spontaneously produced affiliative signals, particularly the “lipsmack,” whose rhythmic features bear similarities with human speech (Ghazanfar and Takahashi, 2014Ghazanfar A.A. Takahashi D.Y. Facial expressions and the evolution of the speech rhythm.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2014; 26: 1196-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These lipsmacks were generated selectively during second-person contexts (Figure 1D). We scored subjects’ facial movements within video segments corresponding to each 2-s fMRI frame: out of a total of 16,224 segments, 57% showed no facial movement, 26% drinking, 1% (225) lipsmacks, and 1% nonlipsmack expressions. (The remaining 15% were indeterminately ingestive or communicative or included visible body or hand motion.) Lipsmack versus nonlipsmack responses (see STAR Methods) varied significantly across experimental conditions, with 185 segments of lipsmacking observed during subject-directed social video, 25 in the subsequent blank period, and 15 total across all other conditions (X2[df = 27; N = 13,826] = 2,473; p ≪ 0.001). Thus, second-person context was a nearly obligate prerequisite for the generation of this stereotypic facial movement. Brain activity was modeled as a function of stimulus condition and parametrically of extraocular facial movement and background body movement as scored by a computer algorithm. Social videos, compared to scrambled controls, activated large parts of cortex (Figure 2A, top; calculation based on brain responses to all social video less that to all scrambled video). These activations included visual, temporal, and prefrontal face patches, as expected, as well as medial frontal areas near the rostral cingulate sulcus, areas PITd and LIP (implicated in attentional control and perceived gaze; Shepherd, 2010Shepherd S.V. Following gaze: gaze-following behavior as a window into social cognition.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 5PubMed Google Scholar, Marciniak et al., 2014Marciniak K. Atabaki A. Dicke P.W. Thier P.

Freiwald W.A. Attentive motion discrimination recruits an area in inferotemporal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 11918-11928Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and several thalamic and amygdalar nuclei (Figure 2A, bottom). Activity was reduced in frontal areas 46, 11, and 10 m and large parts of insular, motor, and cingulate cortex. These effects were likely driven by the presence of visual forms and social content. In contrast, when we compared activation between second- and third-person social contexts, activity was much more restricted (Figure 2B; calculation based on brain responses to all direct-gaze unscrambled video less that to all averted-gaze unscrambled video): a medial frontal cluster of areas around the rostral tip of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was significantly more active in second-person context. In fact, the cluster was activated about twice as strongly in second- than in third-person contexts, a pattern rivaled only subcortically, by the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Thus, social context, a prerequisite for social signal production (Figure 1D), appears to be signaled by a spatially confined circuit. Facial movements yielded a separate activation pattern (Figures 3A and 3B ). Lipsmacks (Figure 3A; calculation based on brain response during manually annotated lipsmacks less that during manually annotated nonmovement, with parametric evaluation of extraocular facial movement ignored) engaged a specific cortical and subcortical motor network, including lateral primary somato-motor cortex (M1 and sM1), ventrolateral premotor cortex (VLPMC), anterior and dorsal insula (AI and DI), an ACC area (M3) just posterior to the second-person context cluster, and subcortical areas, including thalamus, striatum, and brainstem (specifically the facial nucleus, trigeminal motor nucleus, and associated reticular network). A largely identical suite of activations was found for facial movements overall (Figure 3B; calculation based on brain correlates with computer-scored extraocular face movement). Activation in the facial portion of M1 was so strong, it was often detectable during a single facial movement event (Video S1). Thus, in contrast to social perception of second-person contexts, social signal production is supported by a distributed but spatially specific facial motor control system. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJjNzg4NWZiZmFjMTIwZDQwZWM0ZmYyYmU2MDlkYWQ0NiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NzAxNDgyfQ.I4Y5CTfd2mtXJyyzo6py95YsHUjdrzM3-yNAmnV-8AUGnMfT9723kh55CIEcCgMzM8zj7kMc9ecYxHR5Nv5Anctz_KhlthwDhnPTlcM8bz_p1C9I2tRpI1OzjrgqVyGdjIhL4wA9yEOjXncdMnwcVDog_ZbMYWYnA0hfDyN-CaDtwBYr4In0E7yehxIcUDRXOw6zB4s__n8WQ4WMqMyaEQDqafrfS8I0CqFGev4u3sx66hZqXmswnqgE71a7W0beIXWpxMwc1rJ4iQYU60ns3mhQ2mI4mW7ZqjeiUGN65e84DJ0wEEhUK_S70YIressyPYSNP0-pq2rZPbas5Gbipw Download .mp4 (14.23 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. Neural Correlates of Produced Communicative Movement Are Visible in Single Trials, Related to Figure 1The first experimental run of the monkey Milo is shown. Milo is at left, while stimuli are depicted at right with superimposed gaze trace. Because of a calibration error, gaze data are likely shifted down and to the right of their true location. Responses in the primary facial representation of motor cortex (ROI ‘M1’) are shown in green, below; note signal decreases in IRON-fMRI indicate increased neural activity. Lightweight black shows the raw computer-scored facial movement; heavy black shows the computer-scored facial movement after convolution with an IRON-fMRI hemodynamic response function. At bottom, hand-scored facial behavior has been convolved with the IRON-fMRI hemodynamic response function as an alternate set of neural predictors (expressive in orange, lipsmack in red, mixed/miscellaneous movements in magenta). Because the juice tube was omitted from this experimental session, no drinking movements are shown or scored. In monkeys, the facial movement network exhibited functional specialization, but not dissociation, between communicative and noncommunicative movements. Facial-motor cortex (M1, M2, M3, and VLPMC, but not M4; cf. Morecraft et al., 2004Morecraft R.J. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Rossing W.R. The motor cortex and facial expression: new insights from neuroscience.Neurologist. 2004; 10: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was strongly activated by all facial movements across social stimulus context (Figure 4A, top) and movement type (Figure 4A, bottom). Across all conditions, the lateral motor cortices were most strongly and consistently activated. However, lateral motor cortices were relatively more activated by noncommunicative than communicative facial actions, although the reverse was true for the medial facial-motor regions, including putative area M4 (Figure 4A; see also Figures S3 and S4). Two structures previously implicated in affective signaling, the amygdala and PAG, showed only limited evidence for involvement in lipsmack exchange. Hence, neural control of different facial movements, including expressions, appears to be supported by a single facial-control network with quantitative rather than qualitative division of labor between medial and lateral motor areas. Humans and monkeys tend to match facial expressions, a phenomenon referred to as facial mimicry (Lundqvist and Dimberg, 1995Lundqvist L.-O. Dimberg U. Facial expressions are contagious.J. Psychophysiol. 1995; 9: 203-211Google Scholar, Mosher et al., 2011Mosher C.P. Zimmerman P.E. Gothard K.M. Videos of conspecifics elicit interactive looking patterns and facial expressions in monkeys.Behav. Neurosci. 2011; 125: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This simple and strong linkage of facial perception to signal production suggests a “vertically” integrated (modular, feedforward) circuit. A candidate pathway with strong anatomical support proceeds from the face-perception system through the amygdala to cingulate area M3 and from there directly to the facial nucleus (Morecraft et al., 2004Morecraft R.J. Stilwell-Morecraft K.S. Rossing W.R. The motor cortex and facial expression: new insights from neuroscience.Neurologist. 2004; 10: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Livneh et al., 2012Livneh U. Resnik J. Shohat Y.

Neurosci. 2014; 8: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A potential signature of such a feedforward, vertically integrated module is a gradual transition of selectivity from perception to movement generation. Comparing activation profiles for face perception, social context, and face movement across a large number of regions of interest (ROIs) (Figure 4B), we found ROIs activated by perception but only weakly by context or movement generation; areas activated by context, but not movement; and areas activated by movement with little sensitivity to perception or context. A region dorsal to the amygdala, and more weakly the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, showed mixed sensitivity to face perception and movement but no sensitivity to context. To capture the distribution of selectivity across ROIs, we performed multidimensional scaling (Figure 5A). The overall pattern of selectivity indicates strong specialization for either of the three functions—face perception, social context, and face movement—but shows little evidence for gradual transitions between them. A second signature of vertically integrated modules is strong functional connectivity between areas of different specialization within the module. Functional connectivity analysis (Figure 5A) provided little evidence for a strong connection of face perception and movement areas via an amygdala-M3 bridge but instead suggested thalamic and striatal routes. Furthermore, strong functional coupling was found between face perception areas, between cortical and subcortical facial motor areas, and within medial frontal areas. Thus, rather than providing evidence for vertical integration across a social-perception-to-social-response pathway, our functional connectivity analysis suggests the dominance of “horizontal” integration within cortex—that is, within the levels of face perception, of second-person cognition, and of face movement—without strong connections between levels. This view was independently supported by a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) (see STAR Methods). Comparing ICAs across subjects, four large-scale networks were consistently observed (Figure 5B): the first captured activation during social stimulus presentation. The second captured a nonspecific motor network comprising broadly distributed frontal, cingulate, and insular areas, typically suppressed during social stimulus presentation (Figure 1A) and facial movement (Figures 3A and 3B). The third network comprised lateral and medial facial motor areas, M1, sM1, VLPMC, AI, DI, and M3, but not the more anterior social-context-sensitive cluster. The fourth network included this cluster and dorsolateral prefrontal areas and may exert executive control. Together, these results suggest multiple functional networks, with at least three functional specializations, engaged during facial communication (Figure 5C). In this first fMRI study of the neural circuits of social communication in primates, we found a network of cortical and subcortical areas controlling a facial signal, the lipsmack.

The cerebellum contributes to motor control and motor learning. For many behaviors, such as locomotion, reaching, and eye movements, modulation of the firing rate of individual or populations of Purkinje cells correlates with movement kinematics (Thach, 1968Thach W.T.

Additionally, in association with learning, errors, and disease, Purkinje cell activity changes in parallel with altered or disordered movements (Gilbert and Thach, 1977Gilbert P.F. Thach W.T.

These activity patterns are likely to influence motor behaviors, since either electrical or optogenetic disinhibition of Purkinje cell targets generates movement (Noda and Fujikado, 1987Noda H.

How Purkinje cell activity affects natural, well-learned movements can vary by task, however. Purkinje cell firing can be predictive of movement trajectories, instructive in motor learning, corrective of ongoing movements, or permissive of movement only when silenced (Medina, 2011Medina J.F. The multiple roles of Purkinje cells in sensori-motor calibration: To predict, teach and command.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, the inputs to Purkinje cells carry several types of information, including external sensory input, sensory feedback from ongoing movements, and internal motor commands (Lisberger, 2009Lisberger S.G.

The relation between Purkinje cell activity and firing patterns of target cells in the cerebellar nuclei (CbN) can likewise vary (Armstrong and Edgley, 1984aArmstrong D.M. Edgley S.A.

The whisker system of rodents provides a useful context for investigating these questions (Kleinfeld et al., 1999Kleinfeld D. Berg R.W. O’Connor S.M.

Reflexive whisking can be evoked by sensory stimulation, eliciting behaviors that can be controlled and quantified (Bellavance et al., 2017Bellavance M.A. Takatoh J. Lu J. Demers M. Kleinfeld D.

A large portion of the cerebellar cortex is responsive to tactile input to the whiskers, and stimulation of individual whisker follicles alters Purkinje cell activity (Joseph et al., 1978Joseph J.W.

Whisking can also be generated by the relief of inhibition by crus I Purkinje cells (Proville et al., 2014Proville R.D. Spolidoro M. Guyon N. Dugué G.P. Selimi F. Isope P. Popa D. Léna C. Cerebellum involvement in cortical sensorimotor circuits for the control of voluntary movements.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the activity of Purkinje cells can be linearly related to whisker position during spontaneous movements (Chen et al., 2016Chen S. Augustine G.J. Chadderton P. The cerebellum linearly encodes whisker position during voluntary movement.eLife. 2016; 5: e10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the types of inputs that influence Purkinje cell activity during sensory stimulus-evoked reflexive whisking in awake mice, how cerebellar output affects whisking, and the relationship between firing patterns of Purkinje and CbN cells. We find that changes in Purkinje cell simple spike rates correlate with changes in whisker position. Modulation of simple spikes does not require whisking-related sensory feedback but depends on internal motor commands originating in the brainstem. Both Purkinje and CbN cells show well-timed increases in spiking at the onset of puff-evoked whisking, which are absent during spontaneous whisking. Finally, optogenetic activation of Purkinje cells suppresses reflexive sensory-evoked whisking, suggesting that well-timed cerebellar output may augment normal sensory-evoked whisker movements. Previous studies have reported that crus I/II Purkinje cells respond to sensory input from whisker deflections (Bosman et al., 2010Bosman L.W. Koekkoek S.K. Shapiro J. Rijken B.F.

The cerebellum linearly encodes whisker position during voluntary movement.eLife. 2016; 5: e10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we examined Purkinje cell firing patterns in sensory-evoked whisker movements in awake, head-fixed mice acclimated to sitting in a non-constraining tube. We stimulated the ipsilateral whisker pad with 10-ms 20-psi air puffs while making loose cell-attached recordings of action potentials by crus I/II Purkinje cells (Figure 1A). Recordings were obtained from electrode penetrations into lateral crus I (coordinates relative to bregma: caudal 6.0–6.5 mm, lateral 3.0–3.4 mm) at depths of 150–2,000 μm. Purkinje neuron identity was confirmed by the detection of both simple and complex spikes, which were analyzed separately (Figure 1A). In these experiments (N = 5 mice), all whiskers except the ipsilateral C2 (or in one case, C1) whisker were trimmed, and whisker position along the rostral-caudal axis was monitored for correlation with Purkinje cell activity. The puff initially deflected the whisker backward and then reliably evoked a whisker protraction that outlasted the stimulus for a few hundred milliseconds (Figure 1A). A subset of experiments with whiskers present on both sides confirmed that movements were bilateral. We began by examining spike rates; spike timing is considered below. Instantaneous simple spike firing rates in Purkinje cells were modulated in conjunction with whisker movements, with some cells initially increasing and others decreasing their activity (Figure 1B, n = 26). Because baseline firing rates for Purkinje cells during non-whisking periods ranged widely, from 40 to 140 spikes/s, data were analyzed as the change in firing rate and compared to the change in whisker position. Superimposing the grand mean instantaneous firing rate of all Purkinje cells and the grand mean of the associated whisker protractions illustrated a match between the population Purkinje cell response and movement kinematics (Figure 1C, top). A cross-correlation of the mean change in firing rate of all cells with the mean change in whisker position revealed that the increase in firing rate preceded the onset of whisker protraction by 15 ms (Figure 1C, bottom). Linear regression over the points incorporating that lead time gave a slope of 0.98 Hz/degree of protraction with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.93, plotted as the time-shifted Purkinje firing rate versus whisker position for the first 750 ms of the movement (Figure 1C, bottom). The population mean also showed a robust increase in complex spike probability time-locked to the onset of the evoked movement (Figure 1D), illustrating that many individual cells fired complex spikes nearly simultaneously. These results indicate that the population simple spike response of crus I/II Purkinje cells carries a linear representation of reflexive whisker movements, that simple spike rate changes precede the protraction, and that complex spike rates increase during these movements. The observations are consistent with a recent study of spontaneous whisking (Chen et al., 2016Chen S. Augustine G.J. Chadderton P. The cerebellum linearly encodes whisker position during voluntary movement.eLife. 2016; 5: e10509Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and also resemble studies of other motor behaviors, which show Purkinje cell spike modulation in conjunction with, often just preceding, reaching, eye movements, and locomotion (Medina, 2011Medina J.F. The multiple roles of Purkinje cells in sensori-motor calibration: To predict, teach and command.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The linear relation between the changes in Purkinje cell firing rate and whisker position raises the question of to what extent sensory signals and/or motor commands are encoded in Purkinje activity evoked by air puffs. We reasoned that applying the puff contralaterally would alter the nature of the tactile signal to Purkinje cells, so the simple spike pattern would change substantially if the Purkinje cells activity encoded the location of the sensory stimulus. We therefore compared responses of Purkinje cells to an ipsilateral and contralateral puff. On average, the contralateral puff elicited a larger maximal protraction of the single remaining ipsilateral whisker (Figure 1E, top, ipsilateral puff, 29.6° ± 1.2°; contralateral puff, 42.2° ± 3.8°, p = 0.01, paired t test). With a contralateral puff, the magnitude of the ipsilateral movement was indistinguishable during recordings with and without a contralateral whisker (44.3° ± 1.9°, n = 29 cells; 42.2° ± 3.8°, n = 10 cells; p = 0.6). The larger protraction with a contralateral puff is consistent with reports of asymmetrical whisker movements associated with head turns in freely moving rats, which suggest that contralateral stimuli evoke larger ipsilateral whisking movements just before rats turn toward the stimulus (Towal and Hartmann, 2006Towal R.B. Hartmann M.J. Right-left asymmetries in the whisking behavior of rats anticipate head movements.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 8838-8846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Despite this difference in whisking amplitude, Purkinje cells continued to generate responses regardless of the puff location (Figure 1E, bottom); for both ipsilateral and contralateral stimuli, mean changes in firing rate in 50-ms bins for 500 ms following the puff were indistinguishable (n = 10, all bins, p > 0.9, paired t test, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p values). Likewise, the well-timed increase in complex spikes persisted with a contralateral puff (Figure 1F). The similarity of the responses to ipsilateral and contralateral puffs make it seem unlikely that Purkinje cell activity reports sensory input in a manner compatible with fine sensory discrimination. Instead, it seems more likely to relate to factors independent of stimulus location, e.g., either the sensory feedback or motor command associated with bilateral whisker movements. To test the extent to which Purkinje cell firing rates depended upon sensory feedback during reflexive whisking, we removed ipsilateral reafference by suppressing movement with 20 μL lidocaine (2% solution) applied to the ipsilateral facial nerve (Fee et al., 1997Fee M.S. Mitra P.P. Kleinfeld D. Central versus peripheral determinants of patterned spike activity in rat vibrissa cortex during whisking.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Purkinje cell activity in response to contralateral air puffs was then compared in each cell, before and after lidocaine infusion. In these experiments, all whiskers were kept intact to maximize whisking-related sensory feedback in the control condition. Recordings of whisker position confirmed that lidocaine infusion prevented all movement of the ipsilateral whiskers (Figures 2A and 2B , deflection in control = 33.8° ± 2.6°, in lidocaine at matched time = 0.4° ± 0.6°, N = 4 mice, p < 3e-9, paired t test), although the contralateral whiskers continued to whisk normally. Purkinje cells, however, continued to respond to the air puff in the absence of ipsilateral sensory feedback (Figure 2C). Despite the complete loss of movement of the ipsilateral whiskers, the population instantaneous firing rates superimposed (Figure 2D), and the mean changes in firing rate in each 50-ms bin for 500 ms following the puff were indistinguishable (n = 16, all bins, p > 0.75, paired t test, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p values). The data indicate that extreme changes in reafference do not greatly alter simple spike firing rates in response to puff stimulation, suggesting that the initial puff triggers motor-related signals carried through the Purkinje cells. To identify the origin of the putative motor signal, we tested whether Purkinje cell responses and/or puff-evoked movements could be altered by transiently suppressing output from brainstem and/or cortical neurons, both of which project to the cerebellum via mossy fibers (Figure 3A; Proville et al., 2014Proville R.D.

In VGAT-ChR2 mice, an optical fiber was placed in the ipsilateral reticular formation (Figure 3B), in the vicinity of the whisking-related premotor nuclei, including the whisking central pattern generator located in the intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) (Moore et al., 2013Moore J.D.

VGAT-expressing inhibitory neurons in this region were optically stimulated for 500 ms at 50–100 Hz, and a puff was delivered contralaterally at light onset. In response to this stimulation, whisker movements were greatly suppressed (Figure 3C). On average, the peak evoked whisker protraction was reduced from 42.3° ± 2.1° to 9.8° ± 2.1° (whisks associated with recordings from n = 16 cells, p < 1e-11, paired t test, Figure 3D, top), consistent with a successful inhibition of whisking-related premotor centers in the brainstem. In the associated Purkinje cell population responses, the firing rates were decreased significantly in the 50-ms bins between 50 and 200 ms after the puff (n = 16, p < 0.006, paired t test, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p values), suggesting that the late part of the signal indeed depended on activity in the reticular nuclei (Figure 3D, bottom). The earliest part of the Purkinje cell response was unchanged, however, consistent with crus I/II receiving mossy fiber input directly from the trigeminal nuclei (Yatim et al., 1996Yatim N. Billig I. Compoint C. Buisseret P. Buisseret-Delmas C. Trigeminocerebellar and trigemino-olivary projections in rats.Neurosci. Res. 1996; 25: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Light alone without the puff generated no movement and did not change Purkinje cell firing rates, verifying that the stimulus did not activate VGAT-positive neurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellum that could directly inhibit Purkinje cells (Figure 3D, bottom). Additionally, light applied directly to the cerebellar cortex led to an increase in Purkinje cell firing rates (Figure 3E), providing further evidence that the reduction in Purkinje cell spiking resulted from inhibition of brainstem afferents to the cerebellum, rather than any direct effects in the cerebellar cortex. Because anatomical and physiological evidence indicates that vibrissa motor cortex (vM1) projects to the contralateral cerebellar cortex via the pontine nuclei (Proville et al., 2014Proville R.D. Spolidoro M. Guyon N. Dugué G.P. Selimi F. Isope P. Popa D. Léna C. Cerebellum involvement in cortical sensorimotor circuits for the control of voluntary movements.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; Figure 3A), we next repeated the experiment with the optical fiber placed on the surface of contralateral vM1. The relatively small sample size likely gave only a coarse approximation of the control population response; however, optogenetically suppressing vM1 neither reduced puff-evoked whisker movements (deflection in control: 38.7° ± 1.1°; deflection in vM1 inhibition: 38.7° ± 1.9°; p > 0.99 paired t test) nor significantly changed simple spike rates in Purkinje cells measured (Figure 3F, all bins, n = 8, p > 0.9, paired t test, Bonferroni-Holm adjusted p values). Plotting the mean firing rates for the first 250 ms of stimulation with and without optogenetic silencing against each other gave a high linear correlation (r = 0.95), slope near 1 (m = 0.96), and intercept near 0 (b = 0.9 spike/s) for vM1 inhibition but a lower correlation and an altered slope and intercept for brainstem inhibition (0.92, 0.79, −3.37; Figure 3G), illustrating the dependence of Purkinje cell activity on the reticular nuclei but not vM1. The observation that Purkinje cell firing rates correlate with movement raises the question of whether this activity exerts an influence over reflexive whisking. We therefore directly tested whether the puff-evoked protraction was sensitive to elevations in Purkinje cell firing. In mice expressing channelrhodopsin in Purkinje cells (Pcp2-ChR2, STAR Methods; N = 4 mice), crus I/II Purkinje cells were optically stimulated for 200 ms, and the puff was delivered contralaterally at light onset. Optical stimulation greatly accelerated firing by Purkinje cells (Figure 4A, n = 5 cells). The light stimulus also reduced the amplitude of the puff-evoked whisker protraction (Figures 4B and 4C, left). The mean data illustrated that silencing cerebellar output suppressed the puff-evoked whisker protraction by about 15°, which accounted for about a third of the total movement (Figure 4C, right, deflection with no-light control = 46.7° ± 1.8°, with light = 32.6° ± 3.2°; comparing deflection ± light, p = 0.005, N = 4 mice). This value is likely to be an underestimate, since it is unlikely that all relevant Purkinje cells were activated by optical stimulation. Differentiating the whisker position record indicated that the peak velocity of the deflection was reduced as well (control versus light: 1.7 ± 0.1°/ms versus 1.5 ± 0.1°/ms, p = 0.04, N = 4 mice). At light offset, an additional whisker protraction that was absent from control trials was also generated (Figure 4D, deflection at light offset = 17.8° ± 3.4°; at matched time point in no-light control = −2.6° ± 1.0°, ± light, p = 0.01 N = 4 mice); similar protractions upon the offset of Purkinje cell stimulation have been observed previously and are attributed to increased activity of CbN cells (Proville et al., 2014Proville R.D. Spolidoro M. Guyon N. Dugué G.P. Selimi F. Isope P. Popa D. Léna C. Cerebellum involvement in cortical sensorimotor circuits for the control of voluntary movements.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1233-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, cerebellar output accounts for at least ∼30% of the magnitude of sensory-evoked, apparently reflexive whisking. The suppression of movement by Purkinje cell stimulation is somewhat paradoxical, however, given the match between population Purkinje cell firing rate and movement kinematics. In particular, the greatest elevation of Purkinje cell activity is associated with the greatest deflection of the whiskers, raising the question of how Purkinje-mediated inhibition of CbN neurons normally sculpts the trajectory of whisker protractions. To investigate this question, we made recordings from CbN cells in the lateral cerebellar nucleus of Pcp2-ChR2 mice and measured their responses to contralateral puffs. All CbN cells responded to the sensory stimulus with a short-latency, brief increase in firing rate that abruptly returned to or fell below baseline within 35 ms (n = 8 cells, Figures 5A and 5B ). Superimposing the mean Purkinje cell response to a contralateral puff from all experiments (n = 65 cells) illustrated that the population firing rates of CbN cells and Purkinje cells were both initially elevated. Purkinje cells, however, showed a late phase of increased spiking (after ∼25 ms), during which time the CbN cell firing rates dropped below pre-stimulus values (Figure 5B). The initial surge in the CbN response coincided with a drop in the Purkinje response, and the maximal firing rate increase in Purkinje cells occurred between the two peaks in CbN cell firing rates. These observations motivated a closer examination of the spike timing in both sets"

Both WT and genetic variants of the normal plasma protein transthyretin (TTR) form amyloid, but neither the misfolding leading to fibrillogenesis nor the anatomical localization of TTR amyloid deposition are understood. We have previously shown that, under physiological conditions, trypsin cleaves human TTR in a mechano-enzymatic mechanism that generates abundant amyloid fibrils in vitro. In sharp contrast, the widely used in vitro model of denaturation and aggregation of TTR by prolonged exposure to pH 4.0 yields almost no clearly defined amyloid fibrils. However, the exclusive duodenal location of trypsin means that this enzyme cannot contribute to systemic extracellular TTR amyloid deposition in vivo. Here, we therefore conducted a bioinformatics search for systemically active tryptic proteases with appropriate tissue distribution, which unexpectedly identified plasmin as the leading candidate. We confirmed that plasmin, just as trypsin, selectively cleaves human TTR between residues 48 and 49 under physiological conditions in vitro. Truncated and full-length protomers are then released from the native homotetramer and rapidly aggregate into abundant fibrils indistinguishable from ex vivo TTR amyloid. Our findings suggest that physiological fibrinolysis is likely to play a critical role in TTR amyloid formation in vivo.

In vitro studies suggest that TTR fibrillogenesis requires dissociation of the native tetramer, which is favored by the destabilizing mutations that are known to be amyloidogenic. Indeed the most aggressive, earlier onset forms of the disease are caused by highly destabilizing mutations whereas mutations that increase tetramer stability prevent amyloidosis (2Hammarström P.

In addition, mechanical forces, generated by a combination of physiological fluid flow and contact with hydrophobic surfaces, enhance susceptibility to this cleavage and thus uniquely promote formation of unequivocal amyloid fibrils, both by other amyloidogenic variants that are more stable than S52P and by WT TTR (5Marcoux J.

Trypsin, which we have previously used to trigger TTR amyloid fibril formation in vitro, is synthesized only by the exocrine pancreas and secreted exclusively into the small bowel lumen. It is therefore unlikely to be involved in pathogenesis of systemic TTR amyloidosis. However, we show here that plasmin, identified in our comprehensive bioinformatics search for pathophysiologically plausible candidate proteases, effectively replicates the role of trypsin in in vitro TTR amyloidogenesis. Furthermore, the normal, ubiquitous, continuous, physiological activation of plasminogen is fully consistent with a key role of plasmin in TTR amyloidogenesis. There were 344 peptidases in the MEROPS database (6Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Finn R. Twenty years of the MEROPS database of proteolytic enzymes, their substrates and inhibitors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (10.1093/nar/gkv1118 26527717): D343-D350Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) able to cleave substrates with tryptic specificity, that is C-terminal to lysine (position P1), and with relevantly wider tissue distribution than trypsin itself. Seventy-five of them were both human and extracellular according to the curated UniProt protein database, the majority being either serine chymotrypsin–like or metallopeptidase types (Table 1). Among the four enzymes with specificity higher than 30% for lysine at P1 (Table 2), trypsin was excluded because of its exocrine location. Tryptase alpha did not trigger TTR amyloid formation in our fibrillogenesis assay (3Mangione P.P. Porcari R. Gillmore J.D. Pucci P. Monti M. Porcari M. Giorgetti S. Marchese L. Raimondi S.

In contrast, plasmin not only fulfilled our search criteria but its active site is also strikingly similar to that of trypsin (Fig. 1).Table 1Bioinformatics search for trypsin like protease(s)ClanFamilyTypeNumberAA01Asp_pepsin_like3CC01Cys_papain_like1MAM01Aminopeptidase_like2MAM10Metallopeptidase14MAM12Astacin_like7MA–MCM13–M43Neprilysin_like; carboxypeptidase7PAS01Ser_chymotrypsin_like38SBS08Ser_subtilisin_like2SRS60Ser_lactoferrin1Total75 Open table in a new tab Table 2Secreted peptidases with specificity for lysine in position P1 higher than 30%EnzymesSpecificity for Lys at P1Primary localization(%)S01.151: trypsin 160Intestinal tractS01.143: tryptase alpha56Lung, stomach, spleen, heart, and skinS01.020: kallikrein-related peptidase 1255Salivary glands, stomach, uterus, trachea, prostate, thymus, lung, colon, brain, breast, and thyroidS01.233: plasmin45Plasma and many other extracellular fluids Open table in a new tab Consistent with its known structure and proteolytic specificity, plasmin did indeed trigger TTR amyloid formation in vitro, although it was slightly less active than trypsin (Fig. 2). With S52P TTR in solution, stirred at physiological pH and ionic strength, and the same enzyme:TTR w/w ratio, the thioflavin T (ThT) signal increased more rapidly in the presence of trypsin than plasmin and reached a higher final value (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, both samples contained abundant amyloid fibrils with the pathognomonic amyloid red-green birefringence after Congo Red staining when viewed in strong cross-polarized light, and showing typical fibrillar morphology in negative staining EM (Fig. 2, B and C). The crucial residue 49–127 fragment produced by the specific amyloidogenic cleavage was present after fibrillogenesis induced by plasmin but was slightly less abundant than with trypsin (Fig. 2, D and E), consistent with the longer lag phase and lower yield of fibrils (Fig. 2A). However, as in our previous studies with trypsin, TTR amyloid fibrillogenesis mediated by plasmin in the mechano-enzymatic process was accelerated by seeding with preformed TTR amyloid fibrils, which eliminated the lag phase and produced a higher final yield (supplemental Fig. 2). Plasmin-induced fibrillogenesis was inhibited by α2-antiplasmin, the natural inhibitor of the enzyme (Fig. 2F). The critical importance of protease specificity for TTR amyloid formation was exemplified by the failure of three different, potent, proteolytic enzymes, thrombin, chymotrypsin, and proteinase K, to trigger any amyloidogenesis (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, all the amyloidogenic TTR variants tested so far, as well as WT TTR, were cleaved by plasmin in our in vitro mechano-enzymatic system. They all formed unequivocal amyloid fibrils, although the yields were lower with V30M, L55P, and V122I TTR than with S52P and were lowest with WT TTR (Fig. 3). Crucially, the known, superstable, T119M TTR variant was not cleaved at all (Fig. 3). These observations are fully consistent with the usually earlier onset and more aggressive phenotypes in carriers of amyloidogenic TTR mutations, compared with the late onset of WT TTR amyloidosis, and with the protection against TTR amyloidosis in carriers of amyloidogenic TTR gene mutations afforded by co-inheritance of the gene for the T119M variant. In contrast to the susceptibility of native TTR to cleavage by plasmin, which was greatly enhanced by mechanical forces, preformed TTR amyloid fibrils were completely resistant to degradation by plasmin (supplemental Fig. 3). This differs from Aβ-amyloid fibrils that are digested by plasmin, which has been suggested to be a putative protective mechanism against amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease (7Tucker H.M. Kihiko M. Caldwell J.N. Wright S. Kawarabayashi T. Price D. Walker D. Scheff S. McGillis J.P. Rydel R.E. Estus S. The plasmin system is induced by and degrades amyloid-beta aggregates.J.

To study the amyloidogenicity of plasmin in a more physiological environment, we created a model fibrin clot on which fibrinolysis was initiated in the presence of either the highly amyloidogenic unstable S52P TTR variant or the superstable nonamyloidogenic T119M variant. Polymerization and depolymerization were monitored by nonspecific light scattering at 350 nm (Fig. 4A) and by the specific spectrofluorimetric signal of ThT binding to amyloid fibrils (Fig. 4B). In phase I, fibrinogen was converted into fibrin by addition of thrombin, monitored by the rapid increase in turbidity. Once the clot was formed, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen, and TTR were gently layered on the clot surface, at the time point shown (arrow) in Fig. 4, A and B, producing physiological fibrinolysis of the clot as indicated by the rapid decline in turbidity in phase II. When S52P TTR was present, the initial fall in light scattering was swiftly followed by a sharp rise that correlated with the appearance and increase in the ThT amyloid fibril signal (Fig. 4B). In the presence of T119M TTR, which is not susceptible to cleavage by plasmin and does not form amyloid fibrils (5Marcoux J. Mangione P.P. Porcari R. Degiacomi M.T. Verona G. Taylor G.W. Giorgetti S.

Atomic force microscopy analysis of the reactants at the end of the experiment with the stable T119M or the pathogenic S52P variant TTR (that is 4 and 5 in Fig. 4, A–C) showed remarkably different structures, consistent with the spectrometry results. S52P TTR produced morphologically typical mature amyloid fibrils, 4–7 nm in height (Fig. 4D) emerging from a thick layer of short fibrils. No fibrillar material was seen either with T119M TTR (Fig. 4E) or in the absence of any added TTR (Fig. 4F). Only single globular structures and short beaded chains were observed. The spectrum of systemic TTR amyloidosis comprises the many very rare hereditary forms caused by different mutations (8Benson M.D. The hereditary amyloidoses.Best Pract. Res. Clin.

However, elucidation of the mechanism underlying the in vivo transition of native, soluble, globular, tetrameric TTR into insoluble, polymeric, amyloid fibrils is crucial for understanding the natural history of the disease and for design of other effective therapies. The influential original model of TTR denaturation and aggregation at low pH (14Colon W. Kelly J.W.

The limited clinical efficacy probably reflects the fact that the low pH model does not represent the actual pathophysiological mechanism of TTR amyloid fibrillogenesis. Indeed there is no relevant in vivo location in which TTR could be exposed to the acid conditions used in vitro. We have recently demonstrated that specific proteolytic cleavage of the residue 48–49 bond in the flexible loop connecting strands C and D, in just a single TTR protomer within the native tetrameric TTR assembly, causes rapid dissociation into cleaved and uncleaved protomers. Under physiological conditions in vitro, these then swiftly form abundant TTR fibrils, which are indistinguishable from ex vivo TTR amyloid fibrils (3Mangione P.P. Porcari R. Gillmore J.D. Pucci P.

Other features consistent with the mechano-enzymatic mechanism operating in vivo include the presence of a lag-phase preceding fibrillogenesis, and acceleration of fibril formation when preformed fibril seeds are present. We have also shown that binding of small ligands by the intact TTR tetramer significantly reduces its susceptibility to cleavage and aggregation. However, maximum inhibition is only achieved by ligands that simultaneously occupy both the two binding sites and the central channel between them in the core of the TTR molecule (21Verona G. Mangione P.P. Raimondi S. Giorgetti S. Faravelli G. Porcari R. Corazza A. Gillmore J.D. Hawkins P.N. Pepys M.B. Taylor G.W. Bellotti V. Inhibition of the mechano-enzymatic amyloidogenesis of transthyretin: Role of ligand affinity, binding cooperativity and occupancy of the inner channel.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (10.1038/s41598-017-00338-x 28298647): 182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A crucial question about the mechano-enzymatic mechanism has hitherto been the identity of the tryptic protease responsible for TTR amyloidosis in vivo. The present demonstration of the efficacy of plasmin in vitro highlights it as an extremely plausible candidate. Other potent proteolytic enzymes were completely inactive in triggering TTR amyloid formation in vitro. Kallikrein-related peptidase 12, which has only very transient activity in vivo, did produce a small ThT signal of amyloid formation with S52P TTR, the most unstable and amyloidogenic TTR variant, but there was a long lag phase and very modest yield. Plasmin mediates the essential specific cleavage in TTR much more potently and, with classical kinetic phases of nucleation and elongation, it generates abundant fibrils that are identical to ex vivo TTR amyloid fibrils. The relative lower activity of plasmin compared with trypsin cannot be easily explained. The remarkable self-digestion of plasmin, once activated, may reduce its activity and therefore delay the formation of the first fibrillar nuclei thus contributing to a reduced yield of fibrils. A complete characterization of the kinetics of all processes together with the determination of the TTR–plasmin structure should clarify the differences that we have observed. The several amyloidogenic TTR variants tested so far and the WT protein are all cleaved by plasmin, with varying efficiency replicating the findings with trypsin, whereas the stable, nonpathogenic, protective T119M variant is resistant. Furthermore, plasmin is ubiquitously and continuously activated in vivo to provide for essential fibrinolysis on the vascular wall and also in the extracellular matrix, precisely where TTR amyloid is deposited. The possible in vivo scenario of plasmin-mediated TTR fibrillogenesis is summarized in Fig. 5. Plasminogen can be activated by tPA within the clot and also by urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in the extracellular matrix. Sufficient proteolysis of the TTR tetramer by plasmin may then provide the critical concentration of both truncated and full-length TTR protomers required for nucleation of fibrils. Once nucleation has occurred, the elongation of fibrils can progress at lower concentrations of monomers provided by either of the plasminogen activating pathways. Plasmin activity is finely regulated by activators, including tPA and uPA, and inhibitors, including α2-plasmin inhibitor and plasminogen activator inhibitor. The conditions for critical TTR cleavage, sufficient to initiate amyloidogenesis, may thus only arise rarely but there is certainly scope for variation in this complex system. For example, physiological fibrinolysis is notably affected by the intensity of normal physical activity (22Weiss C. Seitel G. Bärtsch P. Coagulation and fibrinolysis after moderate and very heavy exercise in healthy male subjects.Med. Sci. Sports Exerc. 1998; 30 (9502353): 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All these features of plasmin, combined with the importance of mechanical forces, are consistent with the prevalence of TTR amyloid deposition in the heart and carpal tunnel, both of which are notable sites of continuous repetitive vigorous movement. The pathogenetic significance of plasmin also opens a broad and completely novel perspective for investigation of factors that may determine individual susceptibility and the natural history of the familial and acquired forms of TTR amyloidosis, including the initiation, progression, and tissue distribution of amyloid deposition. In addition, the wholly unexpected and surprising confluence of the fibrinolysis pathway, the physiological remodeling of the extracellular matrix regulated by urokinase (23Smith H.W. Marshall C.J. Regulation of cell signalling by uPAR.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11 (10.1038/nrm2821 20027185): 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), and the pathogenesis of TTR amyloidosis are of considerable fundamental interest. Recombinant TTR variants were expressed and purified as described previously (21Verona G. Mangione P.P. Raimondi S. Giorgetti S. Faravelli G. Porcari R. Corazza A. Gillmore J.D. Hawkins P.N.

Human fibrinogen was isolated from citrate-heparin–treated human plasma by affinity chromatography on recombinant clamping factor 221–559 fragment (24Liu C.Z. Cheng H.J. Chang L.Y.

Enzymes purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were plasmin (P1867), proteinase K (P2308), chymotrypsin (C2160000), tPA (T0831), plasminogen (SRP6518), thrombin (T7572), and tryptase (T7063). Trypsin was purchased from Promega (V5280) and recombinant human kallikrein 12 from Biotechne (3095-S.E.). All the enzymes used were able to cleave the C-terminal end of Lys in the d-Val-Leu-Lys 4-nitroanilide dihydrochloride peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, V0882) following the manufacturer's instructions. All other reagents including α2-antiplasmin (SRP6313) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise stated.

The residues of the proteolytic substrate are designated Pn—P4-P3-P2-P1-‖-P1′-P2′-P3′-P4′—Pm′ with ‖ indicating the scissile bond. Substrate specificity was based on the frequency of Lys at position P1. Recombinant S52P TTR, 100 μl volumes at 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, containing 10 μm ThT (25Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Fluorometric determination of amyloid fibrils in vitro using the fluorescent dye, thioflavin T1.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177 (10.1016/0003-2697(89)90046-8 2729542): 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) was incubated at 37 °C in Costar 96-well black plates in the presence of a protease at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50. Plasmin, trypsin, thrombin, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, tryptase alpha, and kallikrein 12 were tested. The plate was sealed with clear sealing film and subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking. Bottom fluorescence was recorded at 500-s intervals (BMG LABTECH, FLUOstar Omega). Homogenous 15% SDS-PAGE (GE Healthcare) under reducing conditions was used to analyze protein composition before and after fibril formation. After electrophoretic separation, samples treated and untreated with trypsin or plasmin were blotted onto an activated PVDF membrane. Western blotting was developed with polyclonal sheep anti-human TTR (6 μg/ml, The Binding Site, United Kingdom/code AU066X) and polyclonal rabbit anti-sheep peroxidase conjugate (1.3 μg/ml, Dako, Denmark/code P0163) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Peroxidase activity was visualized using a precipitating substrate containing 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and urea hydrogen peroxide (SigmaFAST DAB tablets, Sigma-Aldrich). Recombinant S52P TTR in 200 μl volumes at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ThT, was incubated at 37 °C in sealed Costar 24-well black-wall plates, together with 20 ng/μl of plasmin while subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking in the presence of 0.09, 0.18, 0.36, and 0.72 μm α2-antiplasmin and in its absence. Based on an average molecular mass of 55 kDa for plasmin, the selected inhibitor concentrations corresponded to molar ratios to plasmin of 0.25:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1, respectively. ThT fluorescence emission was monitored using a BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega plate reader. Data were normalized to the ThT signal plateau reached in the samples without the plasmin inhibitor. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Recombinant S52P, V30M, L55P, V122I, WT and T119M TTR in 500 μl volumes at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ThT, pH 7.5 were incubated at 37 °C in sealed Costar 24-well black-wall plates, together with 20 ng/μl of plasmin while subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking. ThT fluorescence emission was monitored until it reached a plateau. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. S52P TTR at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ThT, pH 7.5 was incubated at 37 °C with plasmin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 w/w in volume of 200 μl in a 96-well black-wall plate. The plate was sealed with clear sealing film, subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking and bottom fluorescence was recorded (BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega). Aliquots of the final ThT positive material were stained with alkaline alcoholic Congo Red and viewed under high intensity cross-polarized light (26Puchtler H. Waldrop F.S. Meloan S.N. A review of light, polarization and fluorescence microscopic methods for amyloid.Appl. Pathol. 1985; 3 (2429683): 5-17PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were also examined by EM (Joel1200EX) after negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate (3Mangione P.P. Porcari R. Gillmore J.D. Pucci P. Monti M. Porcari M. Giorgetti S. Marchese L. Raimondi S.

S52P TTR at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ThT, pH 7.5 was incubated at 37 °C with plasmin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 w/w in a volume of 200 μl in a 96-well black-wall plate. S52P TTR fibrils, prepared as described above, were added at the outset at 0.1 mg/ml to three replicate wells; triplicate control well received addition of buffer alone. The plate was sealed with clear sealing film, subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking, and bottom fluorescence was recorded at 500-s intervals (BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega). Data were normalized to the highest value of ThT signal after subtraction of the fluorescence intensity attributable to the added seeds alone. The concentration of S52P amyloid fibrils, produced as described above, was measured by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). Fibrils at 0.1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 μm ThT, pH 7.5 in 200 μl aliquots per well were incubated at 37 °C in sealed Costar 96-well black-wall plates in the presence or absence of plasmin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 w/w, with agitation as above. Bottom ThT fluorescence was monitored at 500-s intervals as before in three replicate test and control wells. The two-stage procedure comprised clot formation in phase I followed by fibrinolysis and potential amyloid fibrillogenesis in phase II. The experiments were conducted in Costar 96-well black plates at 37 °C using a multimode plate reader (BMG LABTECH FLUOstar Omega) to monitor either changes in turbidity at 350 nm or ThT emission fluorescence. Fibrin polymerization was initiated by adding thrombin (0.5 NIH units/ml) to 1 μm human fibrinogen in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm CaCl2 (buffer A) in a total volume of 100 μl per well. Clot formation was monitored by recording the turbidity at 350 nm at 20-s intervals. After turbidity had reached a stable level (usually within 30 min), 100 μl of a solution containing tPA, plasminogen, and TTR in buffer A were gently layered on top of the fibrin clot to a final concentration of 0.027 μm, 1 μm, and 18 μm, respectively. The microtiter plate was then sealed with clear sealing film, subjected to 900 rpm double-orbital shaking and absorbance at 350 nm was measured at 500-s intervals at 37 °C. Blank subtraction and a correction based on the volume per well and the microplate dimensions were used to normalize all absorption values to 1-cm path length. ThT at 10 μm was present throughout. Bottom fluorescence was recorded at 20-s intervals for 30 min in stage I; after addition of tPA, plasminogen, and TTR in stage II, the ThT signal was monitored at 500-s intervals for 20 h. Pellets harvested at the end of stage II by centrifugation at 10,600 × g for 20 min were further analyzed by negative staining EM, light microscopy after alkaline alcoholic Congo Red staining as described above (26Puchtler H. Waldrop F.S. Meloan S.N. A review of light, polarization and fluorescence microscopic methods for amyloid.Appl. Pathol. 1985; 3 (2429683): 5-17PubMed Google Scholar), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Pellets harvested at the end of phase II were resuspended in water and 100-fold diluted; 10 μl aliquots of the diluted samples were deposited on freshly cleaved mica and dried under mild vacuum. Samples in which no pellet was present were diluted and deposited as described above, but after drying they were rinsed with water to remove excess salts. Tapping mode AFM images were acquired in air using a multimode scanning probe microscope equipped with an “E” scanning head (maximum scan size, 10 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope V controller (Digital Instruments, Bruker). Single-beam uncoated silicon cantilevers (type OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus and TESPA_V2, Bruker) were used. The drive frequency was between 260 and 310 kHz; the scan rate was 0.25–0.5 Hz. P. P. M., G.

Our study underscores the importance of investigating rare intermediates poised to produce iPSCs, provides insights into reprogramming mechanisms, and offers a valuable resource for the dissection of transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics intrinsic to cell fate change. Cellular reprogramming refers to the process by which differentiated somatic cells are converted into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) upon ectopic expression of defined transcription factor (TF) combinations, typically Oct4 (Pou5f1), Klf4, Sox2, and Myc (OKSM) (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18864) Google Scholar). This technology has enormous potential for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, and drug screening as well as the study of cell fate change following forced redirection of cellular identity (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2016Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. A decade of transcription factor-mediated reprogramming to pluripotency.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). However, reprogramming is generally slow (>2 weeks) and inefficient (<1%), complicating mechanistic studies. Most cells fail to reprogram, indicating the existence of epigenetic barriers as well as the requirement for additional facilitators of this process, which remain largely unidentified. Because cells that do not contribute to successful reprogramming dominate assays that rely on bulk reprogramming cultures, it is imperative to identify and examine those select cells poised to generate iPSCs to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms. Our laboratory and others previously characterized intermediate stages of reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to iPSCs using surface markers (Brambrink et al., 2008Brambrink T. Foreman R. Welstead G.G. Lengner C.J. Wernig M. Suh H. Jaenisch R.

Briefly, we have shown that Thy1 is expressed by MEFs and intermediates that are refractory to reprogramming but lost by early intermediates with iPSC potential. A subset of Thy1– intermediates then upregulates SSEA-1 before activating an Oct4-GFP reporter at later time points, which coincides with the acquisition of a stable, transgene-independent pluripotent state. Although SSEA-1 expression significantly enriches for intermediates that successfully progress toward iPSCs, this population remains heterogeneous and inefficient in conventional reprogramming assays (5%–10% reprogramming efficiency). Recently, the utility of SSEA-1 as a prospective reprogramming marker has been challenged, and other marker combinations, such as CD44 and ICAM1 (O’Malley et al., 2013O’Malley J. Skylaki S. Iwabuchi K.A. Chantzoura E. Ruetz T. Johnsson A. Tomlinson S.R. Linnarsson S. Kaji K. High-resolution analysis with novel cell-surface markers identifies routes to iPS cells.Nature. 2013; 499: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) or CD49d and CD73 (Lujan et al., 2015Lujan E. Zunder E.R. Ng Y.H. Goronzy I.N. Nolan G.P. Wernig M. Early reprogramming regulators identified by prospective isolation and mass cytometry.Nature. 2015; 521: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), have been proposed. However, the relevance of ICAM1 has only been demonstrated at a late time point using a highly efficient reprogramming system, whereas CD49d and CD73 were exclusively tested at early stages of reprogramming using an inefficient and heterogeneous retroviral reprogramming system. Thus, there is no current consensus on which markers are the most useful for isolating cells poised to produce iPSCs. Additionally, no previously reported enrichment protocol has achieved reprogramming efficiencies of greater than 10%–15% for early intermediates (Lujan et al., 2015Lujan E. Zunder E.R. Ng Y.H. Goronzy I.N. Nolan G.P. Wernig M.

To resolve these discrepancies, it will be critical to compare published markers and identify additional markers using the same reprogramming conditions. Furthermore, it will be important to account for the differential ability of sorted cells to survive and adhere to cell culture plates (plating efficiency) because this could profoundly skew the measure of reprogramming efficiency. Here we validate that SSEA-1 is an early predictive marker of reprogramming progression when adjusting for plating efficiency. By systematically testing over a dozen additional markers, we found that Sca-1 and either CD73 (on day 3) or epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (on day 6) subdivide the SSEA-1+ population and allow for the enrichment of early intermediates poised to produce iPSCs with unparalleled efficiencies of up to 95%. We finally exploit this approach to define the dynamics of transcription, chromatin accessibility, and DNA methylation patterns in those rare cells poised to produce iPSCs, revealing unexpected principles about the process of TF-induced cell fate change. “Three/four” (3/4) MEFs were derived from mice heterozygous for Col1a1-tetO-OKSM, a tetracycline-inducible polycistronic 4-factor vector; Col1a1-tetO-OKSmCherry, a tetracycline-inducible polycistronic 3-factor vector with a fluorescent reporter; Rosa26-M2rtTA; and an Oct4-GFP knockin allele (Figure 1A; Bar-Nur et al., 2014Bar-Nur O.

This system ensures near-homogeneous OKSM expression, is highly reproducible, and allows for temporal control of reprogramming by adding or removing doxycycline (dox). Furthermore, the mCherry allele allows us to track expression of the Oct4, Klf4, Sox2 (OKS) transgene and to differentiate mCherry+ reprogramming cells from mCherry– feeders. Unless otherwise specified, all reprogramming assays were performed in the presence of 15% serum, 1,000 U/mL leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and 50 μg/mL ascorbic acid (AA). Following dox exposure, a subset of 3/4 MEFs rapidly loses Thy1 and gains SSEA-1 expression (Figure 1B). To determine the functional significance of these markers, we employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate Thy1+, Thy1–SSEA-1–, and SSEA-1+ intermediates. Sorted cells were then re-plated on feeders and allowed to continue reprogramming for additional days on dox. After a period of dox withdrawal, the numbers of iPSC colonies were determined by alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining to calculate reprogramming efficiencies (Figure 1A, top). We confirmed that all dox-independent AP+ colonies were Oct4-GFP+ (Figure S1A) and have previously demonstrated that AP+ colonies obtained with this system are Nanog+ and support the development of germline chimeras (Bar-Nur et al., 2014Bar-Nur O. Brumbaugh J. Verheul C. Apostolou E. Pruteanu-Malinici I. Walsh R.M. Ramaswamy S. Hochedlinger K. Small molecules facilitate rapid and synchronous iPSC generation.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 1170-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating that they represent bona fide iPSCs. Consistent with our prior results (Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M. Anderssen E. Walsh R.M. Schwarz B.A. Nefzger C.M. Lim S.M. Borkent M. Apostolou E. Alaei S. Cloutier J. et al.A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1617-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M.

Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), Thy1+ cells had poor reprogramming potential at every time point, and their ability to form iPSCs progressively decreased during the reprogramming time course (Figures 1C and 1D). However, contrary to our previous findings, SSEA-1+ cells were no better than Thy1–SSEA-1– intermediates until late in reprogramming. To measure reprogramming efficiencies, we have to disrupt the reprogramming process by dissociating plate-adherent cells, exposing them to the high pressures of cell sorting, and then re-plate them. Few cells survive this process, which could explain our low measure of reprogramming efficiency. Furthermore, if different intermediates exhibit differential survival rates, then this could greatly bias our results. To account for these important variables, we devised a plating efficiency assay. Briefly, defined numbers of cells were sorted onto feeders in 96-well plates, and the limiting dilution (LD) of cells required to detect mCherry+ and/or Oct4-GFP+ progeny was determined for each intermediate population (Figures S1B–S1F). We chose LD over a single cell assay because LD is more robust, allowing us to more precisely assess a wider range of possible plating efficiencies using fewer plates. Nevertheless, we confirmed that plating efficiencies calculated by LD were equivalent to those determined by sorting single cells for day 3 intermediates (Figure S1G). 10,000 cells from the same sort were also transferred to 6-well plates to determine reprogramming efficiencies (Figure 1A). Adjusted reprogramming efficiencies were calculated by dividing reprogramming efficiencies by plating efficiencies for each sorted population. Correcting for plating efficiency improved the overall efficiency of live cells from ∼1% to ∼7% on day 3 and from ∼1% to ∼12% on day 6 of OKSM induction (Figure S1H). Critically, by accounting for plating efficiency, SSEA-1 emerges as an important marker of reprogramming progression at every examined time point (Figure 1E), confirming previous observations by our group. Furthermore, studies that concluded that SSEA-1 was not an early predictive marker of reprogramming did not assess differential plating (Lujan et al., 2015Lujan E. Zunder E.R. Ng Y.H. Goronzy I.N.

High-resolution analysis with novel cell-surface markers identifies routes to iPS cells.Nature. 2013; 499: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, the actual reprogramming potential of SSEA-1+ cells is remarkably high (∼40% on day 3 and day 6). We conclude that any accurate measure of reprogramming potential must account for plating. Next we set out to identify additional markers that could be used in conjunction with Thy1, SSEA-1, and Oct4-GFP to define stages of reprogramming and further enrich for subsets poised to form iPSCs. For this analysis, we used Col1a1-tetO-OKSMhet Rosa26-rtTAhet (het/het) MEFs with an endogenous Oct4-GFP reporter. To identify candidate markers, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on FACS-purified SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1– intermediates. We identified a number of genes encoding for cell surface proteins whose expression changes during reprogramming and that are differentially expressed between SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1– cells. We selected 16 antigens, including previously published markers, for further analysis based on the availability of commercial antibodies for flow cytometry (Figures 2A and S2A). We observed 3 major patterns of marker expression: MEF markers, which are expressed by MEFs and downregulated in SSEA-1+ intermediates; transient markers, which are specifically induced during reprogramming but silenced in iPSCs; and iPSC markers, which are gradually induced during reprogramming and expressed by iPSCs. Surface protein expression, assessed by flow cytometry, mirrored RNA expression (Figures 2A–2C and S2A–S2C). With respect to MEF markers, platelet derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is rapidly downregulated in all intermediates, demonstrating that cells uniformly respond to reprogramming factors. VCAM1 and CD44 are gradually and specifically downregulated in SSEA-1+ intermediates, with VCAM1 being lost before CD44 (Figures 2B and 2C, left). Regarding transient markers, CD73 (Nt5e), CD49d (Itga4), and Sca-1 (Ly6a) are rapidly induced and then silenced prior to Oct4-GFP induction. CD73 and Sca-1 are expressed by both SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1– cells, whereas CD49d is mainly restricted to SSEA-1+ intermediates and is more rapidly silenced (Figures 2B and 2C, center). For iPSC markers, CD71 (Tfrc) is initially induced by all cells and then becomes restricted to SSEA-1+ intermediates. EpCAM is first induced on day 6 specifically in SSEA-1+ intermediates. Unlike other iPSC markers, ICAM1 is first expressed by Thy1+ cells and only late in reprogramming by Oct4-GFP+ intermediates (Figures 2B and 2C, right). Altogether, these markers identify cellular transitions during the reprogramming process and define the heterogeneity of SSEA-1+ progressing intermediates (Figure 2D). For markers to have general utility, they must be applicable to other reprogramming systems and conditions. We first analyzed the effects of small molecules that increase reprogramming efficiency (AA, GSKi, and Alk5i) (Bar-Nur et al., 2014Bar-Nur O. Brumbaugh J. Verheul C. Apostolou E. Pruteanu-Malinici I.

Combinatorial modulation of signaling pathways reveals cell-type-specific requirements for highly efficient and synchronous iPSC reprogramming.Stem Cell Reports. 2014; 3: 574-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; Figure S3). SSEA-1 and EpCAM gain as well as VCAM1, Sca-1, CD24, and Podxl loss correlate with reprogramming progression whereas other markers did not. Interestingly, ICAM1 expression appears to be dependent on AA. We next evaluated tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) derived from neonatal het/het mice. Marker expression is essentially the same as that for MEFs (Figure S4A). Expression of all markers is similar between het/het MEFs and 3/4 MEFs, with the exception of CD49d, which is expressed more highly and for a prolonged period of time in the 3/4 system (Figure S4B). These systems are similar in that they share the Stemcca (polycistronic OKSM) allele. We therefore tested reprogramming of MEFs infected with individual dox-inducible lentiviruses (LVs) for the 4 factors. Remarkably, all progression markers had similar expression patterns in this system compared with het/het MEFs (Figure S4C). Finally, we analyzed another secondary system, “OSKM (Jae),” which differs from Stemcca in the stoichiometry of the 4 factors and the Klf4 isoform (Carey et al., 2011Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J.H. Faddah D.A. Buganim Y. Kim J. Ganz K. Steine E.J. Cassady J.P.

KLF4 N-terminal variance modulates induced reprogramming to pluripotency.Stem Cell Reports. 2015; 4: 727-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These MEFs reprogrammed more slowly and with lower efficiency. They respond to dox induction early by losing PDGFRβ and gaining Podxl, CEACAM1, and Sca-1 (Figure S4D). SSEA-1 is first detectable after day 10 of reprogramming, followed by subsequent expression of CD71, EpCAM, and, finally, c-Kit. This order of marker expression within the SSEA-1+ subset is the same as that in het/het MEFs. We conclude that progression markers are conserved among all examined systems and conditions and, thus, have general applicability. Next, we revisited published markers using the same reprogramming system (3/4 MEFs) and accounting for plating. We first sorted day 3 CD73+ or CD73– and CD49d+ or CD49d– intermediates and assessed reprogramming and adjusted reprogramming efficiencies (Figures 3A and 3B ). Consistent with Lujan et al., 2015Lujan E. Zunder E.R. Ng Y.H. Goronzy I.N. Nolan G.P. Wernig M. Early reprogramming regulators identified by prospective isolation and mass cytometry.Nature. 2015; 521: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, CD73 and CD49d positivity correlate with reprogramming, yielding plating-adjusted efficiencies of 20%–30%. However, this effect was less striking than that of SSEA-1+ cells, which reached efficiencies of up to 40%. Both CD73 and CD49d subdivide the SSEA-1+ population during early reprogramming. We therefore asked whether the CD73+ or CD49d+ subsets within the day 3 SSEA-1+ populations further enrich for reprogramming potential. Indeed, SSEA-1+CD73+ and SSEA-1+CD49d+ subsets had higher reprogramming efficiencies than their SSEA-1+ marker-negative counterparts on day 3 (Figures 3C, S5A, and S5B). However, although these marker combinations were predictive of successful reprogramming early, they tracked with cells that failed to reprogram at later time points. Surprisingly, CD49d and, to a lesser extent, CD73 correlate with mCherry levels, suggesting that these markers, unlike Thy1 and SSEA-1, predominantly reflect expression strength of the OKS transgene, similar to CD24 (Shakiba et al., 2015Shakiba N. White C.A. Lipsitz Y.Y. Yachie-Kinoshita A. Tonge P.D. Hussein S.M. Puri M.C. Elbaz J. Morrissey-Scoot J. Li M. et al.CD24 tracks divergent pluripotent states in mouse and human cells.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 7329Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar; Figure 3D). To determine whether transgene expression correlates with reprogramming efficiency, we sorted SSEA-1+ mCherrylow and mCherryhigh cells and measured adjusted reprogramming efficiencies (Figure 3E). On day 3, higher mCherry levels tracked with increased reprogramming efficiency. However, on day 6, this correlation was gone, similar to our results for CD49d and CD73 (Figures 3C and 3E). CD49d, but not CD73, was more highly expressed during the reprogramming of 3/4 MEFs compared with het/het MEFs (Figures 2B, 2C, and S4B), suggesting that the higher transgene levels in the 3/4 system induce more CD49d expression. To confirm this, we generated MEFs heterozygous or homozygous for Col1a1-OKSM and R26-rtTA and determined the fraction of CD49d+ cells on day 3 by flow cytometry. Indeed, CD49d expression correlated with expression of the reprogramming factors (Figures 3F and 3G). Finally, we reprogrammed MEFs using individual LVs. On day 3, CD49d expression again corresponded with increased reprogramming factor expression (Figure 3H). Thus, CD49d and CD73 appear to be early predictive markers of reprogramming as they enrich for cells with high OKSM levels. Consistent with this, CD73 and CD49d have been shown to be expressed by partially reprogrammed iPSCs, which remain addicted to high levels of exogenous reprogramming factors (Lujan et al., 2015Lujan E. Zunder E.R. Ng Y.H. Goronzy I.N. Nolan G.P. Wernig M. Early reprogramming regulators identified by prospective isolation and mass cytometry.Nature. 2015; 521: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This property makes these markers most useful for systems exhibiting heterogeneous expression of OKSM. ICAM1 expression has also been suggested to correlate with reprogramming potential (O’Malley et al., 2013O’Malley J. Skylaki S. Iwabuchi K.A. Chantzoura E. Ruetz T. Johnsson A. Tomlinson S.R. Linnarsson S. Kaji K. High-resolution analysis with novel cell-surface markers identifies routes to iPS cells.Nature. 2013; 499: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, ICAM1 is expressed predominantly by Thy1+ cells, which are refractory to reprogramming (Figures 2A–2C). Although ICAM1 is first expressed on day 6 within the SSEA-1+ population, its expression negatively correlates with adjusted reprogramming efficiencies (Figures 3C, S5A, and S5B). ICAM1 is likely a late marker of reprogramming because Oct4-GFP+ intermediates are ICAM1+ (Figures 2A–2C). Altogether, we have systematically compared previously described markers under identical conditions and find that the SSEA-1+ population contains the largest fraction of cells poised to form iPSCs at each time point. The SSEA-1+ population is heterogeneous for VCAM1, Sca-1, CD71, and EpCAM expression early in reprogramming (Figure 2). Consistent with its expression pattern, VCAM1 loss within the SSEA1+ population correlates with increased adjusted reprogramming efficiency (Figures 4A, S5A, and S5B). Sca-1 is a transient marker, suggesting that its upregulation might enrich for cells poised to form iPSCs. Unexpectedly, SSEA-1+Sca-1+ cells are less efficient at reprogramming at every time point analyzed, implying that Sca-1 expression marks an alternative reprogramming route that fails to reach the iPSC fate, whereas Sca-1– further enriches for cells poised to become iPSCs (Figures 4A, S5A, and S5B). CD71 and EpCAM are both iPSC markers that correlate with reprogramming progression at each time point, with EpCAM+ cells being more efficient than CD71+ cells on day 6 (Figures 4A, S5A, and S5B). Together, these data demonstrate that our markers enable further enrichment for cells poised to become iPSCs when combined with SSEA-1. We next tested combinations of the aforementioned markers. On day 3, Sca-1, VCAM1, CD73, and CD49d are heterogeneously expressed within the SSEA-1+ population (Figure 4B, top). Critically, SSEA-1+CD73+Sca-1– emerged as the most efficient combination, with a robust reprogramming potential of ∼50% (Figures 4C, left, and S5C). On day 6, many more markers are differentially expressed within the SSEA-1+ population, and there are clear correlations between some of these markers (Figure 4B, bottom). For example, VCAM1+ cells are Sca-1+ and EpCAM–. Therefore, it was not necessary to sort every possible combination. Instead, we focused on EpCAM and Sca-1 expression. Remarkably, the combination of SSEA-1+EpCAM+Sca-1– resulted in an unprecedented adjusted reprogramming efficiency of ∼95%, whereas the other combinations of EpCAM and Sca-1 all had comparatively low reprogramming potentials (Figure 4C, right). Both day 3 efficient (SSEA-1+CD73+Sca-1–) and day 6 efficient (SSEA-1+EpCAM+Sca-1–) intermediates, referred to as “Eff,” are extremely rare, comprising ∼0.3% of all cells on day 3 and ∼0.1% of total cells on day 6 (Figure 4D). To determine whether day 3 Eff cells preferentially give rise to day 6 Eff cells, we sorted day 3 Eff and day 3 inefficient (“Ineff”) cells (SSEA-1+CD73–Sca-1+) and analyzed them after 3 additional days on dox. Indeed, day 3 Eff cells gave rise to ∼10 times more EpCAM+Sca-1– cells than day 3 Ineff cells (Figure S5D), suggesting a direct progression from day 3 Eff to day 6 Eff cells. On day 6, Eff cells are the only intermediates that can generate iPSCs without further dox exposure (Figure 4E); however, this efficiency is extremely low, indicating that the majority of these cells are not yet stably reprogrammed. Finally, all reprogramming systems we analyzed converge on this SSEA-1+EpCAM+Sca-1– intermediate (Figure S5E). These cells arise prior to endogenous Oct4-GFP or Sox2-GFP expression, and almost all GFP+ cells are EpCAM+Sca-1–. In summary, we have dissected the heterogeneity of SSEA-1+ intermediates using additional markers and identified the most critical subsets on day 3 and day 6 (Figure 4F). These intermediates are poised to undergo successful reprogramming at unparalleled efficiencies of up to 50% on day 3 and 95% on day 6. Poised intermediates are a unique tool to dissect the mechanisms of successful reprogramming. We therefore compared day 3 Eff and day 6 Eff cells molecularly with corresponding day 3 Ineff and day 6 Ineff (SSEA-1+EpCAM–Sca-1+) intermediates as well as the starting MEFs and resulting iPSCs by RNA-seq, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (Figure 4F). We initially focused on transcriptional analyses to define gene expression patterns that may account for the striking differences in reprogramming potential. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) illustrates a clear trajectory of transcriptional changes that delineates the successful path to reprogramming (Figure 5A). Of note, day 6 Ineff intermediates appear to be stalled and fail to progress beyond day 3 intermediates, whereas day 6 Eff cells proceed toward iPSCs. Consistent with Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M. Anderssen E. Walsh R.M. Schwarz B.A. Nefzger C.M. Lim S.M. Borkent M. Apostolou E. Alaei S. Cloutier J. et al.A molecular roadmap of reprogramming somatic cells into iPS cells.Cell. 2012; 151: 1617-1632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, we observed two waves of transcriptional changes: from MEFs to day 3 SSEA-1+ cells and from day 6 SSEA-1+ cells to iPSCs (Figure 5B; Table S1). Importantly, day 3 Eff cells were more different from MEFs than day 3 Ineff cells, whereas day 6 Eff cells were more similar to iPSCs than day 6 Ineff cells, suggesting that Eff intermediates are more effective at silencing the somatic program on day 3 and activating the pluripotency program at day 6. Comparing Eff with Ineff intermediates, we detected 264 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on day 3 and 2,209 DEGs on day 6 (Figures 5B and 5C; Table S2). Most day 3 DEGs (190) overlap with day 6 DEGs, suggesting a progression of transcriptional changes. Hierarchical clustering based on day 3 DEGs segregates MEFs from all other samples, indicating that day 3 DEGs are driven by genes that distinguish reprogramming intermediates and iPSCs from MEFs (Figure 5D, left). By contrast, day 6 DEGs cluster day 6 Eff"

We recently reported a new role of endosomes–the delivery of components from extracellular vesicles (EVs) to the nucleoplasm of recipient cells. Using indirect immunofluorescence, FRET, immunoisolation techniques, and RNAi, we report here a tripartite protein complex (referred to as the VOR complex) that is essential for the nuclear transfer of EV-derived components by orchestrating the specific localization of late endosomes into nucleoplasmic reticulum. We found that the VOR complex contains the endoplasmic reticulum–localized vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAP-A), the cytoplasmic oxysterol-binding protein–related protein 3 (ORP3), and late endosome–associated small GTPase Rab7. The silencing of VAP-A or ORP3 abrogated the association of Rab7-positive late endosomes with nuclear envelope invaginations and, hence, the transport of endocytosed EV-derived components to the nucleoplasm of recipient cells. We conclude that the VOR complex can be targeted to inhibit EV-mediated intercellular communication, which can have therapeutic potential for managing cancer in which the release of EVs is dysregulated.

The heterogeneity of EVs in terms of surface antigens also suggests different cargoes and hence distinct biological roles associated with their action (3Kowal J. Arras G. Colombo M. Jouve M.

EVs have received great attention as noninvasive biomarkers in biological fluids for diagnostic use, given that their amount is significantly increased in various cancerous tissues (11Soung Y.H.

This structure appears to act as an intermediate compartment for the delivery of the content of endocytosed EVs (e.g. CD9–CD133 protein complexes) to the nucleoplasm of their host cell (15Rappa G.

Although the nuclear transfer of components derived from EVs represented solely a minute fraction of total endocytosed EV proteins, they nonetheless modified the gene expression profile (15Rappa G.

Little is known about the biogenesis and dynamics of NEI-associated late endosomes. Being composed of two distinct organelles (i.e. nucleus and late endosome), they can be regulated by several mechanisms involving intrinsic and extrinsic factors. For instance, factors influencing the formation and/or stabilization of NEI can control their organization (16Malhas A. Goulbourne C. Vaux D.J.

In transformed cells that contain a hyper-developed nucleoplasmic reticulum (16Malhas A. Goulbourne C. Vaux D.J.

Extracellular factors and regulators of endocytosis may also modulate their dynamics. The amount of EVs added to the recipient cells has been shown to influence their frequency, and hence, the nuclear delivery of EV components (15Rappa G. Santos M.F. Green T.M. Karbanová J. Hassler J.

The membrane contact sites of organelles with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are recognized in various physiological processes (e.g. lipid transport and membrane traffic) and are conserved in all eukaryotic cells (21Raiborg C. Wenzel E.M. Stenmark H. ER-endosome contact sites: molecular compositions and functions.EMBO J. 2015; 34 (26041457): 1848-185810.15252/embj.201591481Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22Phillips M.J. Voeltz G.K.

The ER network makes close contact with mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and plasma membrane. Tethering complexes that maintain close proximity between the apposing ER and organelle-specific membranes stabilize contact sites. The ER contacts could regulate the maturation of endosomes and their fission and transport along microtubules (23Johansson M. Rocha N. Zwart W. Jordens I. Janssen L. Kuijl C. Olkkonen V.M. Neefjes J.

One major player in these contact zones is the integral ER protein VAP-A (vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein-A) (27Lev S. Ben Halevy D. Peretti D. Dahan N. The VAP protein family: from cellular functions to motor neuron disease.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18 (18468439): 282-29010.1016/j.tcb.2008.03.006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). VAP-A interacts in trans with the peripheral late endosomal multidomain oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)–related protein 1L (ORP1L) via the FFAT (diphenylalanine in an acidic tract) domain, whereas the N-terminal ankyrin repeat region of ORP1L binds to small GTPase Rab7 (28Rocha N.

The contact site of the ER-late endosome is regulated by cholesterol level in endosomes, which is sensed by ORP1L or other members of the highly conserved OSBP family (30Suchanek M. Hynynen R.

Sterol binding leads to conformational changes of ORP1L, which modulate their interaction with VAP-A (28Rocha N. Kuijl C. van der Kant R. Janssen L. Houben D. Janssen H. Zwart W. Neefjes J.

Two other late endosomal proteins, STARD3 (MLN64) and STARD3 N-terminal like, which contain the FFAT motif, are also able to bind VAP-A and sense sterol at ER–endosome contact sites (32Alpy F.

In addition, complexes of VAP-A and OSBP or OSBP-related protein 3 (ORP3) are implicated in the tethers of ER with Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane, respectively (33Mesmin B. Bigay J.

The VAP-A homolog, VAP-B, is involved in the close physical association of ER with mitochondria (35Stoica R. De Vos K.J. Paillusson S. Mueller S. Sancho R.M. Lau K.F. Vizcay-Barrena G. Lin W.L. Xu Y.F. Lewis J. Dickson D.W. Petrucelli L. Mitchell J.C. Shaw C.E. Miller C.C.

Given the membrane continuity between ER and outer nuclear membrane (ONM), we sought whether VAP proteins are implicated in tethering late endosomes within NEI. Here, we report that VAP-A, ORP3, and Rab7 form a tripartite complex essential for the presence of late endosomes in the nucleoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear transfer of EV-derived components. The discovery of the VOR complex (an acronym of VAP-A, ORP3, and Rab7) may lead to therapeutic applications by interfering with the mechanism of intercellular communication. We recently described in various cell types the presence of Rab7-positive (hereafter Rab7+) late endosomes in NEI (15Rappa G. Santos M.F. Green T.M. Karbanová J. Hassler J. Bai Y. Barsky S.H. Corbeil D. Lorico A. Nuclear transport of cancer extracellular vesicle-derived biomaterials through nuclear envelope invagination-associated late endosomes.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (28129640): 14443-14461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Given that the ONM is a continuation of the ER membrane, we investigated whether the ER-associated protein VAP-A, a protein involved in the tethering of ER to late endosomes distributed in the cytoplasm, was present in NEI. We chose to use human FEMX-I melanoma cells as a primary model since we discovered NEI-associated Rab7+ late endosomes from that (15Rappa G. Santos M.F. Green T.M. Karbanová J. Hassler J. Bai Y. Barsky S.H. Corbeil D. Lorico A. Nuclear transport of cancer extracellular vesicle-derived biomaterials through nuclear envelope invagination-associated late endosomes.Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (28129640): 14443-14461Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). VAP-A was visualized by expressing a fusion of this protein with green fluorescence protein (VAP-A–GFP), and NEI were observed with an antibody to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We found VAP-A–GFP in SUN2+ NEI (Fig. 1A), but not all of them, were positive (see below). The presence of late endosomes in VAP-A+ NEI was then investigated. Rab7 as a fusion protein with the red fluorescence protein (Rab7–RFP) was used to highlight late endosomes in VAP-A–GFP-transfected FEMX-I cells. As displayed in Fig. 1B, Rab7–RFP+ late endosomes were found in VAP-A–GFP+ NEI. Their dynamic entry therein was also observed live by time-lapse video microscopy (Fig. 1C). Similar data were obtained by applying anti-Rab7 and VAP-A antibodies instead of fluorescent fusion proteins, and the expression level of VAP-A–GFP was comparable with the endogenous protein (see below). Two types of NEI were reported (16Malhas A. Goulbourne C. Vaux D.J. The nucleoplasmic reticulum: form and function.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21 (21514163): 362-37310.1016/j.tcb.2011.03.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The first one contains solely the INM that is penetrating into the nucleoplasm, and the second involves both INM and ONM (Fig. S1A). Consequently, only type II NEI can host cytoplasmic organelles, notably late endosomes. To confirm the presence of VAP-A in type II NEI and to determine the proportion of type I versus type II NEI, we expressed a chimeric ER protein (i.e. GFP containing the ER signal sequence of calreticulin with a KDEL retention signal sequence) in FEMX-I cells and immunolabeled them for VAP-A and SUN2. Both types of NEI were detected (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1B and Video S1). Nonetheless, more than 70% of SUN2+ NEI were positive for chimeric ER protein and/or VAP-A, suggesting that the majority of NEI is of type II (Fig. 1E, data not shown). Originating from the nuclear surface, type II NEI can reach deep regions of the nucleoplasm, as observed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM) or EM (Fig. 1, C and F). VAP-A–GFP proteins were also detected in deep NEI by immunogold EM (Fig. 1G), whereas Rab7+ late endosomes were observed in both NEI and cytoplasm (Fig. 1H). Of note, the entry of late endosomes in VAP-A+ NEI seems to be selective. Early endosomes or Golgi apparatus as highlighted by the expression of Rab5a and Golgi-resident enzyme N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (GALNT2) fused in-frame to RFP, respectively, were excluded from there (Fig. S2, A and B). Altogether, these data indicate that VAP-A is found in NEI that contain late endosomes. To assess the requirement of VAP-A for the presence of late endosomes in NEI, its expression was silenced in melanoma cells using small hairpin (sh) RNAs (for technical details see under “Experimental procedures”). Scrambled shRNA was used as control. The overall expression of VAP-A was reduced by 65% as evaluated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, A and B) and >95% at the single cell level by immunochemistry (Fig. S3A). No morphological alterations in VAP-A–deficient cells were observed by scanning EM (Fig. S3B). However, silencing VAP-A expression resulted in the absence of late endosomes in NEI (Fig. 2, C and D, and Videos S2 and S3), without affecting their distribution throughout the cytoplasm (see below). VAP-A has a homolog, VAP-B. Although the VAP-A silencing was not compensated by an up-regulation of VAP-B (Fig. 2, A and B), and Rab7+ late endosomes were still absent in VAP-B+ NEI of shVAP-A cells (Fig. S3C), we evaluated whether VAP-B substitutes VAP-A function by silencing its expression with shRNA. The overall VAP-B expression was reduced by 65% as observed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, E and F), and by up to 95% at the single-cell level as detected by CLSM (Fig. 2G, data not shown). Silencing VAP-B did not affect VAP-A expression (Fig. 2, E and F) and had no effect on the entry of late endosomes in NEI (Fig. 2, G and H), indicating that VAP-A, but not VAP-B, is required for the presence of NEI-associated late endosomes. Given the absence of late endosomes in NEI of cells specifically deficient in VAP-A, we evaluated whether their entry therein was also impaired. Scrambled shRNA and shVAP-A FEMX-I cells expressing the ER–GFP marker and Rab7–RFP were analyzed by time-lapse video microscopy. Although the movement of Rab7–RFP+ late endosomes in ER–GFP+ NEI was observed in control cells (Fig. 2I, top panels), none of them were observed going there upon VAP-A silencing (Fig. 2I, bottom panels). It is noteworthy that the traffic of late endosomes within the cytoplasm also seemed perturbed (Fig. 2I, data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that the entry and retention of late endosomes in NEI requires VAP-A. Besides the data acquired with FEMX-I cells, a similar set of observations was made with another cell line, i.e. HeLa cells (Fig. S4), indicating that the current phenomenon is not restricted to melanoma cells. To find out how VAP-A regulates the presence of late endosomes in NEI, we investigated whether known interacting partners of VAP-A (i.e. OSBP, ORP1L, STARD3, and ORP3) are expressed in FEMX-I cells and if they localize in NEI. Immunoblots of FEMX-I cell lysates revealed that they are all expressed, and the VAP-A silencing did not influence their expression level (Figs. S2C and S5, A and B). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that OSBP, ORP1L, or STARD3 was not associated with NEI (Fig. S2, C and D), whereas ORP3, a protein implicated in the tether of ER and plasma membrane, was (Fig. 3A). Moreover, ORP3 co-localized with VAP-A (Fig. S5C), and silencing VAP-A reduced the number of SUN2+ NEI containing ORP3, suggesting that VAP-A expression is necessary for the presence of ORP3 in NEI (Fig. 3, A and B). The latter observation prompted us to test whether ORP3 is also required for the localization and/or retention of late endosomes in NEI. Again, its expression was silenced using shRNA. Under these conditions, the expression level of VAP-A was not significantly changed as observed by immunoblotting (Fig. S6, A and B, p = 0.1717 (scrambled shRNA control) or 0.1243 (untransfected control)), and its localization in NEI was maintained as detected by CLSM (data not shown). Upon Rab7–RFP expression, Rab7 fluorescence was found associated with NEI (ORP3+/SUN2+) in scrambled shRNA cells, but not in NEI (ORP3−/SUN2+) of shORP3 cells (Fig. 3C, top and bottom panels, respectively, and Video S4), indicating that ORP3 is required for the presence of late endosomes in NEI (Fig. 3D). The dual co-localizations of VAP-A/Rab7, VAP-A/ORP3, and ORP3/Rab7 in NEI indirectly suggest an interaction among all of them. This issue was substantiated by double-immunolabeling for ORP3 and Rab7 of FEMX-I"
https://openalex.org/W2884595106,"One of the world's most important crops, barley, was domesticated in the Near East around 11,000 years ago. Barley is a highly resilient crop, able to grown in varied and marginal environments, such as in regions of high altitude and latitude. Archaeobotanical evidence shows that barley had spread throughout Eurasia by 2,000 BC. To further elucidate the routes by which barley cultivation was spread through Eurasia, simple sequence repeat (SSR) analysis was used to determine genetic diversity and population structure in three extant barley taxa: domesticated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare), wild barley (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum) and a six-rowed brittle rachis form (H. vulgare subsp. vulgare f. agriocrithon (Åberg) Bowd.). Analysis of data using the Bayesian clustering algorithm InStruct suggests a model with three ancestral genepools, which captures a major split in the data, with substantial additional resolution provided under a model with eight genepools. Our results indicate that H. vulgare subsp. vulgare f. agriocrithon accessions and Tibetan Plateau H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum are closely related to the H. vulgare subsp. vulgare in their vicinity, and are therefore likely to be feral derivatives of H. vulgare subsp. vulgare. Under the eight genepool model, cultivated barley is split into six ancestral genepools, each of which has a distinct distribution through Eurasia, along with distinct morphological features and flowering time phenotypes. The distribution of these genepools and their phenotypic characteristics is discussed together with archaeological evidence for the spread of barley eastwards across Eurasia."

The striatum, the gateway of the basal ganglia, receives massive inputs from all areas of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus and gives rise to the output circuits of the basal ganglia by way of multi-synaptic pathways leading to the brainstem and thalamus. Neural activity in the striatum is influenced by dopaminergic afferents from the substantia nigra, serotonergic afferents from raphe nuclei, cholinergic inputs from the brainstem, and other neuromodulatory circuits. The striatum thus constitutes a key substrate through which diverse functional regions of the neocortex and thalamus modulate not only downstream motor programs for the initiation of voluntary behaviors, but also neural systems underpinning emotion, motivation, evaluation, and learning (Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M.

Basal ganglia circuits for reward value-guided behavior.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 289-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The majority of neurons in the striatum are output spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that follow two fundamental organizational schemes. First, the striatum has a striking compartmental organization by which labyrinthine neurochemically specialized zones called striosomes lie embedded within the much larger matrix compartment (Graybiel and Ragsdale, 1978Graybiel A.M. Ragsdale Jr., C.W. Histochemically distinct compartments in the striatum of human, monkeys, and cat demonstrated by acetylthiocholinesterase staining.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1978; 75: 5723-5726Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). This striosome-matrix architecture contributes to the functional input and output connectivity of the striatum. The SPNs of striosomes receive preferential input from particular limbic regions and have privileged output to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and indirectly to the lateral habenula, thus engaging crucial dopamine- and serotonin-related neuromodulatory systems (Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2017Brimblecombe K.R.

By contrast, SPNs of the matrix compartment receive inputs from sensorimotor and associative cortical regions and in turn project to the main pallidonigral output nuclei of the basal ganglia that target downstream premotor regions and thalamocortical circuits (Flaherty and Graybiel, 1994Flaherty A.W.

The developmental basis of this striosome and matrix segregation is not well understood. Superimposed upon striosome-matrix compartmentalization is a split between the projections of SPNs to the basal ganglia output nuclei: the pallidum and the substantial nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (Gerfen, 1992Gerfen C.R.

Parallel basal ganglia circuits for voluntary and automatic behaviour to reach rewards.Brain. 2015; 138: 1776-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). SPNs projecting to the internal pallidum and SNr constitute the so-called direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs), considered to release basal ganglia-mediated inhibition or inhibition-excitation sequences and to promote action. By contrast, the SPNs projecting to the external pallidum give rise to the indirect pathway (iSPNs), conventionally considered to inhibit actions, potentially those with unwanted characteristics (Freeze et al., 2013Freeze B.S. Kravitz A.V. Hammack N. Berke J.D. Kreitzer A.C. Control of basal ganglia output by direct and indirect pathway projection neurons.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 18531-18539Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The direct-indirect pathway dichotomy has been formulated as a center-surround system in which wanted movements are promoted by the direct pathway and competing, interfering motor programs are inhibited (Mink, 1996Mink J.W. The basal ganglia: focused selection and inhibition of competing motor programs.Prog. Neurobiol. 1996; 50: 381-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar) and fresh evidence suggests different roles in aversive versus rewarding actions (Kravitz et al., 2012Kravitz A.V. Tye L.D. Kreitzer A.C. Distinct roles for direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons in reinforcement.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). With its large size and output organization, the matrix compartment is the main source of the direct and indirect pathways, but striosomes as well as matrix contain both dSPNs and iSPNs, at least as categorized by the expression of dopamine D1 (in dSPNs) and D2 (in iSPNs) receptors (Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2017Brimblecombe K.R.

Despite strong evidence for the coexistence of the striosome and matrix compartments and the direct and indirect pathways, little is known about the relationship between these two fundamental axes of striatal organization. A clue to the importance of developmental mechanisms underlying the compartmental divisions first came from findings that SPNs making up striosomes and matrix have different birthdates, with striosomal SPNs generated earlier than those of matrix (Graybiel and Hickey, 1982Graybiel A.M. Hickey T.L. Chemospecificity of ontogenetic units in the striatum: demonstration by combining [3H]thymidine neuronography and histochemical staining.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neuronal birthdate underlies the development of striatal compartments.Brain Res. 1987; 401: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Here we link this evidence to neural progenitors and lineage mechanisms known to be crucial in the striatal developmental program (Rubenstein and Campbell, 2013Rubenstein J.L.R. Campbell K. Neurogenesis in the Basal Ganglia.in: Patterning and Cell Type Specification in the Developing CNS and PNS. Chapter 24. Academic Press, 2013: 455-473Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The neuroepithelium of the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) of the embryonic ventral telencephalon consists of diverse types of progenitors that emerge and differentiate across several phases of striatal neurogenesis (Turrero García and Harwell, 2017Turrero García M. Harwell C.C. Radial glia in the ventral telencephalon.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 3942-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These include regenerative radial glial progenitors (RGs), which give rise to apical intermediate progenitors (aIPs) such as short neural progenitors (SNPs) and subapical progenitors (SAPs), as well as basal intermediate progenitors (bIPs) (Pilz et al., 2013Pilz G.-A. Shitamukai A. Reillo I. Pacary E. Schwausch J. Stahl R. Ninkovic J. Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Godinho L. et al.Amplification of progenitors in the mammalian telencephalon includes a new radial glial cell type.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although certain lineage relationships and neurogenic capacity of some of these progenitor types have been characterized (e.g., Pilz et al., 2013Pilz G.-A. Shitamukai A. Reillo I. Pacary E. Schwausch J. Stahl R. Ninkovic J. Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Godinho L. et al.Amplification of progenitors in the mammalian telencephalon includes a new radial glial cell type.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), their developmental trajectory during LGE neurogenesis and especially their link to different SPN types and striatal circuit organization remain unknown. Tapping into the molecular mechanisms expressed in different progenitor types, we performed systematic genetic fate mapping to resolve different progenitor types and trace their developmental trajectories from lineage progression to the distinct SPN types that they give rise to. Here, we demonstrate that striosomal and matrix SPNs are sequentially generated from an RG lineage program through sequential allocation of distinct types of IPs with different amplification capacities. Whereas the early phase of this program produces striosomal SPNs through fate-restricted Ascl1+ aIPSs with limited neurogenic capacity, the late phase amplifies matrix SPN production through the deployment of fate-restricted Ascl1+/Dlx1+ bIPMs with expanded neurogenic capacity. During the final phase, Dlx1+ bIPs specifically generate SPNs of the annular compartment adjoining striosomes. Notably, a similarly clear temporal and progenitor type split was not observed for the genesis of D1 and D2 receptor bearing direct and indirect pathway SPNs. We found that each of these pathways is derived in parallel from both aIPSs and bIPMs throughout the course of RG lineage progression, with a bias toward D1 early and D2 late in post-mitotic stages of differentiation. These findings suggest that a primary LGE lineage program gives rise to striosome-matrix compartmentalization, superimposed upon which a secondary and different mechanism gives rise to direct and indirect pathway SPNs within each compartment. Thus, the major components of striatal architecture are rooted in a radial glia lineage program at the inception of striatal development, which differentiates the striosome and matrix compartments through sequential phases of lineage progression and distinct intermediate progenitor types. These findings establish a lineage framework for exploring the assembly of cortico-basal ganglia circuitry and should provide new clues to the differential vulnerabilities of the striosome-matrix compartments and direct-indirect pathways in human disease states. The formation of the LGE around embryonic day (E) 9.5 along the subpallium is followed shortly by the onset of neurogenesis, when proliferative neuroepithelial cells (NEs) begin to transform into neurogenic radial glial progenitors (RGs) (Sousa and Fishell, 2010Sousa V.H. Fishell G. Sonic hedgehog functions through dynamic changes in temporal competence in the developing forebrain.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2010; 20: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although all striatal SPNs are generated from LGE RGs, recent studies have identified multiple types of progenitors with distinct molecular and morphological characteristics that are derived from RGs at different embryonic times (Pilz et al., 2013Pilz G.-A. Shitamukai A. Reillo I. Pacary E. Schwausch J. Stahl R. Ninkovic J. Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Godinho L. et al.Amplification of progenitors in the mammalian telencephalon includes a new radial glial cell type.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Turrero García and Harwell, 2017Turrero García M. Harwell C.C. Radial glia in the ventral telencephalon.FEBS Lett. 2017; 591: 3942-3959Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These include apical progenitors (aIPs, e.g., SNPs and SAPs) and also basal progenitors (bIPs). How these different progenitor types relate to distinct striatal SPN types remains largely unknown. We used several inducible CreER drivers to perform comprehensive genetic fate mapping of multiple LGE progenitor types. Among the markers expressed in telencephalic progenitors (i.e., pallium and subpallium), the anti-proliferative protein TIS21 is unique in its specific expression in all progenitors undergoing neurogenic divisions, including subsets of RGs, aIPs, and bIPs (Attardo et al., 2008Attardo A. Calegari F. Haubensak W. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. Huttner W.B. Live imaging at the onset of cortical neurogenesis reveals differential appearance of the neuronal phenotype in apical versus basal progenitor progeny.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To fate map different types of neurogenic progenitors, especially self-renewing RGs in the process of neurogenesis, we generated a knockin Tis21-CreER driver and demonstrated that tamoxifen (TM)-induced activation of the Ai14 reporter reliably and efficiently captured neuron-producing progenitors (Figures 1 and S1). The Tis21-CreER driver thus provided a unique and powerful fate-mapping tool for LGE neurogenic RGs starting from the very onset of neurogenesis. In this context, transiently neurogenic IPs were distinguished from self-renewing RGs using multiple criteria, including high expression of Ascl1 and morphology of basal processes (Harwell et al., 2015Harwell C.C. Fuentealba L.C. Gonzalez-Cerrillo A. Parker P.R.L. Gertz C.C. Mazzola E. Garcia M.T. Alvarez-Buylla A. Cepko C.L. Kriegstein A.R. Wide Dispersion and Diversity of Clonally Related Inhibitory Interneurons.Neuron. 2015; 87: 999-1007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This enabled tracing of the RG lineage progression through sets of embryonic IPs to their SPN progenies in the postnatal striatum (Figures 1A and 1B). At the onset of neurogenesis at ∼E10, 8-hr pulse-chase of Tis21+ progenitors labeled both RGs and aIPs (Figures 1C, 1F, and 1G). We could not strictly distinguish between SNPs and SAPs, as these aIP subtypes are defined by their cell division patterns best captured by live imaging experiments (Pilz et al., 2013Pilz G.-A. Shitamukai A. Reillo I. Pacary E. Schwausch J. Stahl R. Ninkovic J. Snippert H.J. Clevers H. Godinho L. et al.Amplification of progenitors in the mammalian telencephalon includes a new radial glial cell type.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Importantly, 48 hr after E10 TM induction (i.e., at E12), dozens of RFP+ RGs and aIPs remained in the ventricular zone (VZ), indicating that fate-mapped RGs self-renewed and continued to generate aIPs (Tables 1 and S1). Sparse labeling allowed identification of elongated cell clusters comprised of RGs with multiple closely associated IPs and newly postmitotic neurons. These clusters became increasingly spatially isolated over time and likely represented clonal descendants from an initial neurogenic RG (Figures 1D, 1H, 1I, and S1D). Even at 96 hr after E10 TM induction (i.e., at E14), dozens of RFP+ RGs still remained in VZ of each brain sampled, indicating persistent self-renewal (Figures 1E, 1J–1L, S1E, and S1F; Tables 1 and S1). Particularly large cell clones were frequent, which consisted of a “founder RG,” multiple Ascl1+ IPs, and larger number of postmitotic neurons likely migrating along the RG radial fiber (Figures 1L and S1F; Table S2, Video S1). Whereas E10-labeled RGs gave rise to aIPs contacting the lateral ventricle from E10–E12 (Figures 1D and 1H and 1I), they mainly led to the generation of bIPs in the subventricular zone (SVZ) by E14 (Figures 1E and 1J-1L). All Ascl1+RFP+ contacted the lateral ventricle at 8 hr following E10 TM induction, distinguishing this population as aIPs and not bIPs.Table 1Average Number of Progenitors Per Brain in Tis21-CreER;Ai14 MiceRadial Glia (Ascl1−)Apical (Ascl1+)Basal (Ascl1+)Total RFP+ cells per LGEAverage number of fate-mapped progenitors per brainaRounded to the nearest single cell8-hr pulse-chase106791233948-hr pulse-chase35283114996-hr pulse-chase26242226Scored as RG, aIP, bIP, and the total number RFP+ cells within the ventricular and subventricular zone of the LGE at 8 hr, 48 hr, or 96 hr following E10 TM induction.a Rounded to the nearest single cell Open table in a new tab Scored as RG, aIP, bIP, and the total number RFP+ cells within the ventricular and subventricular zone of the LGE at 8 hr, 48 hr, or 96 hr following E10 TM induction. https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/1ea3aae9-b164-44a1-acc4-b1692ec889e0/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

Large Isolated Progenitor Cluster at 96 hr, Related to Figures 1 and S1 To determine the identity of SPNs derived from early Tis21+ RGs, we assayed the striatum on postnatal day (P) 28 (Figures 1M–1O). Both striosomal (S) and matrix (M) SPNs were generated, roughly in a 1:4 ratio (Figure 1O). We then combined genetic fate mapping of RGs at E10 and consecutive birth dating by EdU at E11 and BrdU at E14. We found that RFP+ S cells were predominantly double labeled by EdU at E11, whereas RFP+ M cells were predominantly double labeled by BrdU at E14 (Figures 1P–1W). Additionally, rare examples of EdU+BrdU+RFP+ triple-labeled cells were observed in the matrix, suggesting that they derived from a single progenitor that was actively dividing both on E11 (S cell production period) and E14 (M cell production period; Figure 1X). These results suggest that along the lineage progression, the same early Tis21+ RG population first generates S cells and then M cells, likely via production of several types of IPs. The proneural protein ASCL1 is restricted more to differentiated neurogenic progenitors than to self-renewing RGs, and it is important in coordinating the balance between neural progenitor proliferation and cell-cycle exit toward neurogenesis (Guillemot and Hassan, 2017Guillemot F. Hassan B.A. Beyond proneural: emerging functions and regulations of proneural proteins.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2017; 42: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). ASCL1 expression exhibits two distinct dynamic patterns: an oscillatory pattern of relatively low ASCL1 levels correlating with cell-cycle progression and proliferation, versus sustained expression at higher levels driving neurogenic cell division and neuronal differentiation (Imayoshi et al., 2013Imayoshi I. Isomura A. Harima Y. Kawaguchi K. Kori H. Miyachi H. Fujiwara T. Ishidate F. Kageyama R.

Kageyama R. bHLH factors in self-renewal, multipotency, and fate choice of neural progenitor cells.Neuron. 2014; 82: 9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ascl1-CreER driver is an effective tool for selectively labeling progenitors biased toward adopting a neurogenic path (Sudarov et al., 2011Sudarov A. Turnbull R.K. Kim E.J. Lebel-Potter M. Guillemot F. Joyner A.L. Ascl1 genetics reveals insights into cerebellum local circuit assembly.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11055-11069Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar; Figures 2A–2D). Throughout the E10 LGE, we detected both low and high levels of ASCL1 immunoreactivity in cells within the VZ, suggesting intermingling of cells in various proliferative (oscillatory expression) and neurogenic (sustained expression) states, as supported by their expression patterns of progenitor or postmitotic cell markers (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2A–SD). We used relatively low-dose TM induction to achieve sparse labeling and to target progenitors with high-level Ascl1 expression, which we verified by co-labeling with anti-ASCL1 antibody (Figure 2H). A brief 8-hr pulse-chase labeling with TM induction in E10.5 Ascl1-CreER;Ai14 embryos reliably labeled aIPs with endfeet at the ventricle surface, with or without basal radial fibers (Figure 2D). At 18 and 24 hr following induction at E10.5, few or no RFP+ progenitors remained in the VZ, in sharp contrast to Tis21+ RGs (Figure 1D), indicating that E10 Ascl1+ progenitors are aIPs, rather than RGs endowed with extensive capacity for self-renewal. It is possible that a lower level of Ascl1 might have been expressed in RGs as well as in aIPs, not captured by our low-dose TM induction. Newly postmitotic RFP+ cells expressed typical SPN markers such as CTIP2 as they reached the striatum, but not Nkx2.1, a marker of GABAergic interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), suggesting that all fate-mapped cells were SPNs (Figures S2G–S2J). We then examined the types of mature SPNs in P28 striatum derived from E10.5-labeled Ascl1+ aIPs (Figures 2J–2N). Strikingly, early Ascl1+ aIPs gave rise almost exclusively to SPNs located within striosomes. These neurons exhibited spiny dendrites and clustered into relatively discrete, widely distributed zones that were positive for the striosome marker mu opioid receptor 1 (MOR1) and negative for the matrix marker CalDAG-GEFI (CDGI) (Figures 2J–2L; Videos S2 and S3) (Kawasaki et al., 1998Kawasaki H.

These are likely cells that have not fully completed migration to striosomes but are S cell in type, as the axons of labeled SPNs formed dense projections to SNc, characteristic of S cells. Throughout the period from E9.5 to E12.5, these Ascl1+ aIPs almost exclusively generated S cells and not M cells (Figures 2P, 2Q, 5, and S4B). eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2NTM2MDE1YzIzNTMxODFkMjEwMTQ3YTI2NGZkYzAwNCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MDkyMjMzfQ.qvdxHHuC6uLHm-QSLYhoGxkq9f6XTPmATq9mwryaxOtb1dMTmdMxErBU4Le4W6frPh3kcekcnA1cEi76ySYD21FZ7yr3tuoUMwNM7lYetC8yhaEqEdFPJeWeEVz_wAltuu4zuwwTv_KHJkxdrjFCRlYj3S-OW0MHXqtBihn5dYNY64dH_8x8yDTOUh5qIeJCnjiHF5fUoUDKjKEeUcScxMGEGnJRLdppdR2qvs-NC3sl7F9gOagXKU7qWoxJqS387FfdqRQUcdIWRYeRwFO0ziw-Og5GqkRWePy8EVJxe3TXs2UocWZn8ub56wjVP76dT30Q6FXfz7U7UzWoANeWyA Download .mp4 (7.8 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S2.

https://openalex.org/W2883054445,"Osteoarthritis is a common disease in joint cartilages. Because the molecular pathogenesis of osteoarthritis remains elusive, early diagnostic markers and effective therapeutic agents have not been developed. To understand the molecular mechanisms, we attempted to identify transcription factors involved in the onset of osteoarthritis. Microarray analysis of mouse articular cartilage cells indicated that retinoic acid, a destructive stimulus in articular cartilage, up-regulated expression of sex-determining region Y-box (Sox)4, a SoxC family transcription factor, together with increases in Adamts4 and Adamts5, both of which are aggrecanases of articular cartilages. Overexpression of Sox4 induced a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 4 and 5 motif (ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5, respectively) expression in chondrogenic cell lines C3H10T1/2 and SW1353. In addition, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Sox4 up-regulated ADAMTS4 and Adamts5 gene promoter activities by binding to their gene promoters. Another SoxC family member, Sox11, evoked similar effects. To evaluate the roles of Sox4 and Sox11 in articular cartilage destruction, we performed organ culture experiments using mouse femoral head cartilages. Sox4 and Sox11 adenovirus infections caused destruction of articular cartilage associated with increased Adamts5 expression. Finally, SOX4 and SOX11 mRNA expression was increased in cartilage of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonosteoarthritic subjects. Thus, Sox4, and presumably Sox11, are involved in osteoarthritis onset by up-regulating ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5.-Takahata, Y., Nakamura, E., Hata, K., Wakabayashi, M., Murakami, T., Wakamori, K., Yoshikawa, H., Matsuda, A., Fukui, N., Nishimura, R.

Adolescents with poor diet in early childhood and/or females with an early onset of menarche may be at greater risk for developing anemia due to the rapid depletion of iron stores in their bodies.The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and severity of anemia among school adolescents in Wonago district, Gedeo Zone, South Ethiopia.A school based cross-sectional study was conducted among 443 randomly selected school adolescents across 15 schools (2 secondary schools and 13 primary schools) in the district. Hemoglobin concentration from a capillary blood sample was determined by portable hemoglobin meter (HemoCue). Descriptive statistics were computed for prevalence of anemia, anthropometric measurements, socio-economic and socio-demographic variables. A hierarchical multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify determinants of anemia among adolescents.The prevalence of anemia among adolescents in the study area was 22%. Anemia was higher among those in early adolescence period (10-13 years) (AOR: 4.75, CI: 1.69-13.35) compared to late adolescence (17-19 years) and among those with height for age z-score less than -2 (AOR: 6.23, CI: 1.98-19.62). Similarly, anemia was higher among those in households with a family size greater than five members (AOR: 9.82, CI: 2.42-39.88), adolescents from rural areas (AOR: 4.37, CI: 1.54-12.46) and families who purchase food needed for daily consumption (AOR: 3.25, CI: 1.42-7.45). On the other hand, adolescents from middle wealth quintiles (AOR: 0.26 (CI: 0.07-0.98)) and female adolescents (AOR: 0.34 (CI: 0.15-0.79) were less likely to be anemic in this study.The prevalence of anemia in this population is of moderate public health concern, adolescents of both sexes are among groups at risk for the development of anemia. The need for further assessment of the etiology of anemia should be considered to design pragmatic intervention programs."

In yeast, the stability of the HMGR isozyme Hmg2 is controlled by the 20-carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Increasing GGPP levels cause more efficient degradation by the HMG-CoA reductase degradation (HRD) pathway, allowing for feedback regulation of HMGR. The HRD pathway is critical for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded ER proteins. Here, we have explored GGPP's role in HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. We found that GGPP potently regulates Hmg2 levels in vivo and causes reversible Hmg2 misfolding at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. These GGPP-mediated effects were absent in several stabilized or nonregulated Hmg2 mutants. Consistent with its high potency, GGPP's effects were highly specific such that other structurally related molecules were ineffective in altering Hmg2 structure. For instance, two closely related GGPP analogues, 2F-GGPP and GGSPP, were completely inactive at all concentrations tested. Furthermore, GGSPP antagonized GGPP's effects in vivo and in vitro. Chemical chaperones reversed GGPP's effects on Hmg2 structure and degradation, suggesting that GGPP causes selective Hmg2 misfolding. These results indicate that GGPP functions in a manner similar to an allosteric ligand, causing Hmg2 misfolding through interaction with a reversible, specific binding site. Consistent with this, the Hmg2 protein formed multimers, typical of allosteric proteins. We propose that this “allosteric misfolding,” or mallostery, observed here for Hmg2 may be a widely used tactic of biological regulation with potential for development of therapeutic small molecules that induce selective misfolding.

https://openalex.org/W2883275350,"Both obesity and DENV infections are growing public health concerns that have far-ranging socioeconomic effects, especially in developing countries. Despite the increasing prevalence of these conditions, there is a scarcity of data investigating the potential relationships between these two entities. Our study aims to examine the influence of obesity on various clinical and laboratory parameters amongst patients with DENV infections. A total of 335 hospitalized patients aged >12 years who were DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen-positive were enrolled in this study. Clinical and laboratory variables were compared between patients with and without obesity. Multivariate analysis showed that the following admission clinical findings and laboratory results were independently associated with obesity; chills and rigors (AOR:2.653, 95% CI: 1.286-5.474), higher temperature (AOR:1.485, 95% CI: 1.080-2.042), higher systolic BP (AOR:1.057, 95% CI:1.037-1.078), raised haematocrit (AOR: 1.953, 95% CI: 1.010-3.778), elevated creatinine (AOR:3.504, 95% CI:1.351-9.008) and elevated ALT (AOR: 4.146, 95% CI:1.878-9.154). Obesity was found to be significantly associated with hospitalization >3 days (AOR: 1.990, 95% CI: 1.134-3.494) and the presence of increasing haematocrit with decreasing platelets (AOR: 2.134, 95% CI = 1.235-3.688). Serial assessment of laboratory data revealed that peak haematocrit was significantly higher and nadir platelets levels were significantly lower in obese patients. Both peak and admission levels of leukocyte counts, AST, ALT and creatinine were significantly higher in the obese group. Conversely, both admission and nadir albumin levels were lower for the obese group, although only nadir albumin levels achieved statistical significance. These findings support closer clinical monitoring of obese patients who present with DENV infections, as this patient cohort may possess an increased tendency towards developing more severe clinical manifestations of DENV infections as compared to non-obese patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883027381,"The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] represents a promising pharmacologic target for the treatment of metabolic disorders, including obesity and cachexia, via central appetite modulation. The GHSR-1a has a complex pharmacology, highlighted by G-protein–dependent and—independent downstream signaling pathways and high basal constitutive activity. The functional selectivity and signaling bias of many GHSR-1a–specific ligands has not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the pharmacologic properties of ghrelin, MK-0677, L692,585, and [d-Lys3]-growth hormone–releasing peptide-6 (Dlys), JMV2959, and [d-Arg(1),d-Phe(5),d-Trp(7, 9), Leu(11)]-substance P (SP-analog). We investigated their effect on basal GHSR-1a constitutive signaling, ligand-directed downstream GHSR-1a signaling, functional selectivity, and signaling bias. Dlys behaved as a partial antagonist with a strong bias toward GHSR-1a–β-arrestin signaling, whereas JMV2959 acted as a full unbiased GHSR-1a antagonist. Moreover, the SP-analog behaved as an inverse agonist increasing G-protein–dependent signaling, but only at high concentrations, whereas, at low concentrations, the SP-analog attenuated β-arrestin–dependent signaling. Considering the limited success in the clinical development of GHSR-1a–targeted drugs so far, these findings provide a novel insight into the pharmacologic characteristics of GHSR-1a ligands and their signaling bias, which has important implications in the design of novel, more selective GHSR-1a ligands with predictable functional outcome and selectivity for preclinical and clinical drug development.—Ramirez, V.

Oxidative stress (OS) and defective placental dysfunction are contributing factors. This study determined the association between AMA and adverse pregnancy outcomes, OS biomarkers and angiogenic growth mediators (AGMs) in normal pregnancies. Methods This prospective cohort study conducted at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O&G) Department of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) finally included 175 normal pregnant women comprising, 58 AMA (35–45 years), 55 (30–34 years) and 62 optimal childbearing age (20–29 years). Venous blood samples were collected at 28–32 weeks for soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PIGF), 8-epiprostaglandinF2-α (8-epi-PGF2α) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) assays. Results Pregnancies of AMA had a significantly higher levels of sFlt-1, 8-epi-PGF2α and 8-epi-PGF2α: PIGF ratio but a reduced level of PIGF, TAC and PIGF: sFlt-1 ratio compared to 20–29 years (p<0.0001). A significant negative correlation between AMA and PIGF (r = -0.294; p = 0.038); TAC (r = -0.215; p = 0.001) and PIGF: sFlt-1 ratio (r = -0.457; p<0.0001) and a positive correlation with sFlt-1 (r = 0.269; p = 0.017), 8-epiPGF2α (r = 0.277; p = 0.029) and 8-epi-PGF2: PIGF ratio (r = 0.461; p<0.0001) levels were observed. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR), and 95% confidence interval, and p value for the significant independent adverse outcomes associated with AMA were emergency caesarean section [21.7 (5.9–121.3), p<00001], elective caesarean section [2.7(0.9–5.8), p = 0.0105], stillbirth [12.6(1.4–82.1), p<0.0001], post-partum haemorrhage [4.3(1.1–18.5), p = 0.0094], preterm delivery [8.2(3.5–28.4), p<0.0001], low birth weight babies [9.7(2.8–29.3), p<0.0001], birth asphyxia [3.8(1.6–12.7), p = 0.0054], Apgar score ≤ 7 after 5 min for babies [10.1(4.7–23.2), p<0.0001], placental abruption [3.5(1.3–8.4), p = 0.0117] and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) [4.6(2.3–12.9), p = 0.0001]. Conclusion AMA pregnancies correlate with adverse pregnancy outcomes and imbalance in OS biomarkers and AGMs. It is incumbent on health care givers to provide effective antenatal care among AMA mothers as early identification of these imbalance and treatment can prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes."

To understand this receptor heterodimer and its regulation, we characterized the molecular mechanisms required for TCR-mediated TCR–CXCR4 complex formation. We found that the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of CXCR4 and specifically phosphorylation of Ser-339 within this region were required for TCR–CXCR4 complex formation. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated depletion of G protein–coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) or inhibition by the GRK2-specific inhibitor, paroxetine, inhibited TCR-induced phosphorylation of CXCR4–Ser-339 and TCR–CXCR4 complex formation.

Despite progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of RTK cross-regulation of CXCR4, little is currently understood about how an antigen-recognition receptor such as the TCR is able to transactivate and form heterodimers with CXCR4. RTK transactivation of CXCR4 has been shown in several cases to be associated with serine phosphorylation of CXCR4, which stimulates downstream outcomes such as cell motility, tumorigenesis, MAPK signaling, β-arrestin–mediated signaling, and receptor desensitization (25Zuo K.

The seven GRK family members represent three distinct families: the GRK1 family (GRK1 and GRK7), the GRK2 family (GRK2 and GRK3), and the GRK4 family (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6). The GRK families share the N-terminal, catalytic, and RH domains; however, the GRK2 family has an additional pleckstrin homology domain that can bind to Gβγ (31Yang J. Villar V.A. Armando I. Jose P.A. Zeng C. G protein-coupled receptor kinases: crucial regulators of blood pressure.J. Am.

T cells have been shown to express high levels of GRK2 and GRK3, and TCR stimulation further increases their expression (32De Blasi A. Parruti G. Sallese M.

Yet, until now, no role for a GRK in the mediation of TCR-induced cytokine production, CXCR4 transactivation, or TCR–CXCR4 complex formation has been described. Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrated that CXCR4 is required for the TCR to stimulate a PREX1/Rac-1 signaling pathway that is required for stabilization of the cytokine mRNA transcripts (12Kremer K.N. Dinkel B.A. Sterner R.M. Osborne D.G. Jevremovic D. Hedin K.E.

However, the molecular mechanism responsible for the coupling of these receptors to PREX1 following TCR stimulation was not known. In other cell types, the Rac–GEF PREX1 can be regulated downstream of GPCRs via the G protein subunits Gβγ and via the generation of PIP3 by PI3Kγ, which results in the plasma membrane recruitment and activation of PREX1 (24Sosa M.S.

PI3Kγ is composed of the catalytic subunit p110-γ and either of the p101 or p85 regulatory subunits, and it can be activated via Gβγ signaling downstream of GPCRs (34Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R.

PI3Kδ has previously been linked to TCR signaling, T cell development, and immune function (35Stark A.K. Sriskantharajah S. Hessel E.M. Okkenhaug K.

Here, we identify a previously unknown function of GRK2 as a target of TCR-stimulated tyrosine kinases. We also show that GRK2 is required for the TCR-mediated transactivation of CXCR4, mediating phosphorylation of the CXCR4 residue Ser-339, which is required for TCR–CXCR4 complex formation. Consistent with these results, we additionally show that either depletion or inhibition of GRK2 significantly impaired the ability of T cells to produce high levels of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines. Furthermore, PREX1 localization was inhibited using the PI3Kγ inhibitor IPI-549, and either inhibition or depletion of PI3Kγ significantly reduced TCR-mediated cytokine production. Together, these results significantly expand understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for cross-regulation of CXCR4 and the TCR in T cells. We previously reported that the association of TCR with CXCR4 in response to ligation of the TCR is required for activation of a cytokine mRNA stabilization pathway that leads to robust production of IL-2 and IL-10 (12Kremer K.N.

These changes are robust to many task variations and can occur quite rapidly. For instance, our previous study found both motor and sensory shifts arise in as few as 6 rotated-cursor training trials. The aim of this study is to investigate one of the training signals that contribute to these rapid sensory and motor changes. We do this by removing the visuomotor error signals associated with classic visuomotor rotation training; and provide only experience with a visual-proprioceptive discrepancy for training. While a force channel constrains reach direction 30o away from the target, the cursor representing the hand unerringly moves straight to the target. The resulting visual-proprioceptive discrepancy drives significant and rapid changes in no-cursor reaches and felt hand position, again within only 6 training trials. The extent of the sensory change is unexpectedly larger following the visual-proprioceptive discrepancy training. Not surprisingly the size of the reach aftereffects is substantially smaller than following classic visuomotor rotation training. However, the time course by which both changes emerge is similar in the two training types. These results suggest that even the mere exposure to a discrepancy between felt and seen hand location is a sufficient training signal to drive robust motor and sensory plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2883622310,"Introduction Frailty is a geriatric syndrome that has been defined differently with various indices. Without a uniform definition, it remains unclear how to interpret and compare different frailty indices (FIs). With the advances in index mining, we find it necessary to review the implicit assumptions about the creation of FIs. We are concerned the processing of frailty data may introduce measurement error and bias. We aim to review the assumptions, interpretability and predictive power of FIs regarding mortality. Methods Three FIs, the Functional Domains Model proposed by Strawbridge et al. (1998), the Burden Model by Rockwood et al. (2007) and the Biologic Syndrome Model by Fried et al. (2004), were directly compared using the data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal study since 1996 mainly following up Americans aged 50 years and over. The FIs were reproduced according to Cigolle et al. (2009) and interpreted with their input variables through forward-stepwise regression. Biases were the residuals of the FIs that could not be explained by own input variables. Any four of the input variables were used to create alternative indices. Discrete-time survival analysis was conducted to compare the predictive power of FIs, input variables and alternative indices on mortality. Results We found frailty a syndrome not unique to the elderly. The FIs were produced with different degrees of bias. The FIs could not be fully interpreted with the theory-based input variables. The bias induced by the Biological Syndrome Model better predicted mortality than frailty status. A complicated FI, the Burden Model, could be simplified. The input variables better predicted mortality than the FIs. The continuous FIs predicted mortality better than the frailty statuses. At least 6865 alternative indices better predicted mortality than the FIs. Conclusion FIs have been used as outcome in clinical trials and need to be reviewed for adequacy based on our findings. The three FIs are not closely linked to the theories because of bias introduced by data manipulation and excessive numbers of input variables. We are developing new algorithms to develop and validate innovative indices."

We investigated hyperglycemia-mediated pulmonary vascular leakage and metastasis and C-peptide inhibition of these molecular events using human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. VEGF, which is elevated in the lungs of diabetic mice, activated transglutaminase 2 (TGase2) in HPMVECs by sequential elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. VEGF also induced vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin disruption and increased the permeability of endothelial cells, both of which were prevented by the TGase inhibitors monodansylcadaverine and cystamine or TGM2-specific small interfering RNA. C-peptide prevented VEGF-induced VE-cadherin disruption and endothelial cell permeability through inhibiting ROS-mediated activation of TGase2. C-peptide supplementation inhibited hyperglycemia-induced ROS generation and TGase2 activation and prevented vascular leakage and metastasis in the lungs of diabetic mice. The role of TGase2 in hyperglycemia-induced pulmonary vascular leakage and metastasis was further demonstrated in diabetic Tgm2−/− mice.

The purpose of the present study was to quantify the horizontal movement of the head and eyes while baseball batters hit a fastball to clarify a visual strategy for this highly trained interceptive task. Six collegiate baseball players hit a fastball that was launched from a pitching machine. The ball speed was 31.9 m·s-1 for the Slow Ball Task and 40.3 m·s-1 for the Fast Ball Task. Horizontal head movements were analysed using images that were captured by two high-speed video cameras. The Horizontal eye movement was recorded with electrooculography. The angular speed of the horizontal head and eye movements during hitting were divided into four time periods (I-40 = 21–40% of total ball-flight, I-60 = 41–60% of total ball-flight, I-80 = 61–80% of total ball-flight, I-100 = 81–100% of total ball-flight) and analysed using analysis of variance and a Tukey post-hoc multiple-comparison. In the Slow Ball Task, the horizontal angular velocity of the head during I-80 was significantly faster than that during I-40 (p < 0.05). In the Fast Ball Task, the horizontal angular velocity of the head during I-80 was significantly faster than that during I-40 and I-60 (p < 0.05). These results indicated that the tracking motion of the head became faster as the launched ball came close to the batters, but there was no change in the angular tracking motion of the eyes. Therefore, rapid eye movement may not be suitable to accurately estimate the ball’s future location during fastball hitting based on the eye-centered coordinates. Our findings suggest that conventional vision training with a wide range of saccadic or smooth-pursuit eye movements does not reflect the characteristics of tracking strategies during baseball hitting."
https://openalex.org/W2884376459,"The skin represents a physical and chemical barrier against invading pathogens, which is additionally supported by restriction factors that provide intrinsic cellular immunity. These factors detect viruses to block their replication cycle. Here, we uncover the Myb-related transcription factor, partner of profilin (MYPOP) as a novel antiviral protein. It is highly expressed in the epithelium and binds to the minor capsid protein L2 and the DNA of human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are the primary causative agents of cervical cancer and other tumors. The early promoter activity and early gene expression of the oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 is potently silenced by MYPOP. Cellular MYPOP-depletion relieves the restriction of HPV16 infection, demonstrating that MYPOP acts as a restriction factor. Interestingly, we found that MYPOP protein levels are significantly reduced in diverse HPV-transformed cell lines and in HPV-induced cervical cancer. Decades ago it became clear that the early oncoproteins E6 and E7 cooperate to immortalize keratinocytes by promoting degradation of tumor suppressor proteins. Our findings suggest that E7 stimulates MYPOP degradation. Moreover, overexpression of MYPOP blocks colony formation of HPV and non-virally transformed keratinocytes, suggesting that MYPOP exhibits tumor suppressor properties."

In Escherichia coli, damage is recognized by 2 key enzymes: UvrA and UvrB. Despite extensive investigation, the role of UvrA's 2 ATPase domains in NER remains elusive. Combining single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and classic biochemical methods, we have investigated the role of nucleotide binding in UvrA's kinetic cycle. Measurement of UvrA's steady-state ATPase activity shows it is stimulated upon binding DNA ( kcat 0.71-1.07/s). Despite UvrA's ability to discriminate damage, we find UV-damaged DNA does not alter the steady-state ATPase. To understand how damage affects UvrA, we studied its binding to DNA under various nucleotide conditions at the single molecule level. We have found that both UV damage and nucleotide cofactors affect the attached lifetime of UvrA. In the presence of ATP and UV damage, the lifetime is significantly greater compared with undamaged DNA. To reconcile these observations, we suggest that UvrA uses negative cooperativity between its ATPase sites that is gated by damage recognition. Only in the presence of damage is the second site activated, most likely in a sequential manner.-Barnett, J. T., Kad, N. M.

Traditional methods for establishing monitoring indexes are mostly focused on single point displacements, and rational monitoring indexes based on multi-point displacements are rare. This study establishes monitoring indexes based on correlation and discreteness of multi-point displacements. The proposed method is applicable when several monitoring points show strong correlation. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was introduced for preprocessing the observations of multi-point displacements. Correlation and discreteness of multi-point displacements were extracted and constructed. The correlation and discreteness parts described the integral and local variance of the displacement field. On this basis, the annual maximum values of the correlation and discreteness parts were selected and their probability density functions (PDF) could be generated by employing the principle of maximum entropy. PDF was constructed using maximum entropy method and was least subjective because it barely provided the moment information of the observations. The multi-point monitoring indexes were then determined by the typical low probability method based on the obtained PDFs. Finally, the proposed method was analyzed using a practical engineering and was verified in terms of its feasibility."

However, the exact mechanism and potential molecular targets of this effect remain unclear. Thus, in this study we investigated the neuroprotective effects of leonurine on hypoxia ischemia injury and explored the underlying mechanisms. An in vitro model of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced PC12 cells was established to mimic ischemic-like conditions. Cell viability, apoptosis, Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII expression levels were evaluated after treatment with leonurine. The Cx36-selective antagonist mefloquine and CaMKII Inhibitor KN-93 were used to investigate the neuroprotective effect of leonurine on and the involvement of Cx36/CaMKII in this process. The results revealed that cell viability decreased and cell apoptosis and the protein expression of Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII increased in the OGD-induced PC12 cells. Leonurine significantly increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis and the protein expression of Cx36 and pCaMKII/CaMKII in the OGD-induced PC12 cells. The specific inhibitor of Cx36 and CaMKII displayed similar protective effects. Moreover, the inhibition of Cx36 reduced pCaMKII levels and the ratio of pCaMKII/CaMKII in the OGD-induced PC12 cells, and vice versa. Taken together, these results suggest that leonurine might have a protective effect on OGD-induced PC12 cells through targeting the Cx36/CaMKII pathway. Thus, leonurine appears to have potential as a preventive or therapeutic drug against ischemic-induced neuronal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2884965396,"Glucosamine (GlcN) is a naturally occurring derivative of glucose and an over-the-counter food additive. However, the mechanism underlying GlcN action on cells is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of GlcN on natural killer (NK) cells. We demonstrate that GlcN affects NK-92 cell cytotoxicity by altering the distribution of cathepsin C, a cysteine protease required for granzyme processing in cytotoxic granules. The relocation of cathepsin C due to GlcN was shown to be accompanied by a decrease in the intracellular enzyme activity and its extracellular secretion. Similarly, the relocation of endosomal aspartic cathepsin E was observed. Furthermore, we elucidated that repositioning of cathepsin C is a consequence of altered signaling pathways of cytotoxic granule movement. The inhibition of phosphorylation upstream and downstream of ERK by GlcN disturbed the polarized release of cytotoxic vesicles. Considerable changes in the ERK phosphorylation dynamics, but not in those of p38 kinase or JNK, were observed in the IL2-activated NK-92 cells. We found decreased phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1 and simultaneous prolonged phosphorylation of ERK as well as its nuclear translocation. Additionally, a protein downstream of the ERK phosphorylation cascade, paxillin, was less phosphorylated, resulting in a diffuse distribution of cytotoxic granules. Taken together, our results suggest that dietary GlcN affects signaling pathway activation of NK-92 immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2883424461,"Here we describe development of a microfluidic viscometer based on arrays of magnetically actuated micro-posts. Quantitative viscosities over a range of three orders of magnitude were determined for samples of less than 20 μL. This represents the first demonstration of quantitative viscometry using driven flexible micropost arrays. Critical to the success of our system is a comprehensive analytical model that includes the mechanical and magnetic properties of the actuating posts, the optical readout, and fluid-structure interactions. We found that alterations of the actuator beat shape as parameterized by the dimensionless ""sperm number"" must be taken into account to determine the fluid properties from the measured actuator dynamics. Beyond our particular system, the model described here can provide dynamics predictions for a broad class of flexible microactuator designs. We also show how the model can guide the design of new arrays that expand the accessible range of measurements."
https://openalex.org/W2883094164,"Recent studies have revealed that relationships between plant pathogens and their vectors differ depending on species, strains and associated host plants. Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) is one of the most important plant viruses worldwide and is transmitted by at least 89 aphid species in a non-persistent manner. TuMV is fundamentally divided into six phylogenetic groups; among which Asian-BR, basal-BR and world-B groups are known to occur in Japan. In Kyushu Japan, basal-BR has invaded approximately 2000 and immediately replaced the predominant world-B virus group. To clarify the relationships between TuMV and vector aphids, we examined the effects of the TuMV phylogenetic group on the population growth of aphid vectors in turnip plants. The population growth of a generalist aphid, Myzus persicae, was not significantly different between non-infected and TuMV-infected treatments. The population growth of a specialist aphid, Lipaphis erysimi, was higher in TuMV-infected plants than non-infected ones. Similar results were obtained in experiments using world-B and basal-BR groups of TuMV. Therefore, we conclude that L. erysimi is more mutualistic with TuMV than M. persicae, and differences in TuMV phylogenetic groups do not affect the growth of aphid vectors on turnip plants."
https://openalex.org/W2883149336,"Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA (PLA2G2A) is a phospholipase which has a role in inflammation, atherogenesis, and host defense. Previously, we found that PLA2G2A protects mice on high-fat diets from weight gain and insulin resistance. Here, we examined the regulation of PLA2G2A and the metabolic changes that occur in response to variations in thyroid status. In particular, the impact of PLA2G2A on the brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic gene expression was explored. We induced hypothyroidism in C57BL/6 and PLA2G2A-overexpressing (IIA+) mice over a 10 wk period or treated them with thyroid hormone (T3) for 5 wk. There were no significant changes in PLA2G2A abundance in response to thyroid status. The energy expenditure of hypothyroid IIA+ mice did not increase; however, the energy expenditure, substrate utilization, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance were all elevated in the IIA+ mice given T3. Moreover, white adipocytes from IIA+ mice were much more prone to ""beiging,"" including increased expression of brown adipose thermogenic markers such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PR domain containing 16, and early B cell factor 2. Finally, the BAT of IIA+ mice had increased UCP1 and other proteins indicative of mitochondrial uncoupling and nonshivering adaptive thermogenesis. These data reveal a novel role for PLA2G2A on adipose tissue thermogenesis depending on thyroid status.-Kuefner, M. S., Deng, X., Stephenson, E. J., Pham, K., Park, E. A. Secretory phospholipase A2 group IIA enhances the metabolic rate and increases glucose utilization in response to thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2884363365,"Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with more than 53,000 expected to be diagnosed with the disease in 2018. The median survival time after diagnosis is four to six months. The poor survival statistics are due in part to the fact that pancreatic cancer is typically asymptomatic until it reaches advanced stages of the disease. Although surgical resection provides the best chance of survival, pancreatic cancer is rarely detected when surgery is still possible due, in part, to lack of effective biomarkers for early detection. The goal of the research reported here was to determine if it was possible to identify metabolic biomarkers for detection of pre-cancerous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) that precede pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The transgenic Ptf1a-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D mouse strain was used as a model of pancreatic cancer progression. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was employed to compare metabolic profiles of urine, sera, fecal extracts, and pancreatic tissue extracts collected from control and study mice aged 5, 11, and 15 months, including 47 mice with tumors. We were able to identify the following potential biomarkers: decreased 3-indoxylsulfate, benzoate and citrate in urine, decreased glucose, choline, and lactate in blood, and decreased phenylalanine and benzoate and increased acetoin in fecal extracts. Potential biomarkers were validated by p-values, PLS-DA VIP scores, and accuracies based on area under ROC curve analyses. Essentially, all of the metabolic profiling changes could be explained as being associated with the consequences of bicarbonate wasting caused by a complete substitution of the normal pancreatic acinar tissue by tissue entirely composed of PanIN. Given the nature of the mouse model used here, our results indicate that it may be possible to use NMR-based metabolic profiling to identify biomarkers for detection of precancerous PanIN that immediately precede pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2884583042,"In the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, the employed bee and the onlooker bee phase involve updating the candidate solutions by changing a value in one dimension, dubbed one-dimension update process. For some problems which the number of dimensions is very high, the one-dimension update process can cause the solution quality and convergence speed drop. This paper proposes a new algorithm, using reinforcement learning for solution updating in ABC algorithm, called R-ABC. After updating a solution by an employed bee, the new solution results in positive or negative reinforcement applied to the solution dimensions in the onlooker bee phase. Positive reinforcement is given when the candidate solution from the employed bee phase provides a better fitness value. The more often a dimension provides a better fitness value when changed, the higher the value of update becomes in the onlooker bee phase. Conversely, negative reinforcement is given when the candidate solution does not provide a better fitness value. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on eight basic numerical benchmark functions in four categories with 100, 500, 700, and 900 dimensions, seven CEC2005’s shifted functions with 100, 500, 700, and 900 dimensions, and six CEC2014’s hybrid functions with 100 dimensions. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides solutions which are significantly better than all other algorithms for all tested dimensions on basic benchmark functions. The number of solutions provided by the R-ABC algorithm which are significantly better than those of other algorithms increases when the number of dimensions increases on the CEC2005’s shifted functions. The R-ABC algorithm is at least comparable to the state-of-the-art ABC variants on the CEC2014’s hybrid functions."

https://openalex.org/W2883802291,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays a key role in the development and maintenance of animal tissues. This signaling is mediated by the atypical G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (Smo). Smo activation leads to signaling through several well-characterized effectors to activate Hh target gene expression. Recent studies have implicated activation of the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gαi and the subsequent decrease in cellular cAMP levels in promoting the Hh response in flies and mammals. Although Hh stimulation decreases cAMP levels in some insect cell lines, here using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay we found that this stimulation had no detectable effect in Drosophila S2-R+ cells. However, we observed an unexpected and significant Gαs-dependent increase in cAMP levels in response to strong Smo activation in Smo-transfected cells. This effect was mediated by Smo's broadly conserved core, and was specifically activated in response to phosphorylation of the Smo C-terminus by GPCR kinase 2 (Gprk2). Genetic analysis of heterotrimeric G protein function in the developing Drosophila wing revealed a positive role for cAMP in the endogenous Hh response. Specifically, we found that mutation or depletion of Gαs diminished low-threshold Hh responses in Drosophila, whereas depletion of Gαi potentiated them (in contrast to previous findings). Our analysis suggested that regulated cAMP production is important for controlling the sensitivity of cellular responses to Hh in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2884225568,"Hydrostatic pressure is an important physical stimulus which can cause various responses in bacterial cells. The survival and cellular processes of Escherichia coli under hydrostatic pressures between 10 MPa and 110 MPa have been studied. However, understanding bacterial responses to moderately elevated pressure of up to 10 MPa is useful for a range of different applications including for example in smart and responsive materials. In this study, the genetic responses of E. coli K-12 MG1655 to 1 MPa pressure was examined using transcriptomic analysis by RNA-Seq. The results show that 101 genes were differentially expressed under 1 MPa pressure in E. coli cells, with 85 of them up-regulated. The analysis suggested that some genes were over expressed to adapt the increase of oxygen levels in our system, and several functional categories are involved including oxidative stress responses, Fe-S cluster assembly and iron acquisition. Two differentially expressed genes azuC and entC were further investigated using RT-qPCR, and GFP reported strains of those two genes were created, AG1319 (PazuC azuC-msfgfp) and AG1321 (PentC entC-msfgfp). A linear response of azuC expression was observed between 0 MPa to 1 MPa by monitoring the fluorescence signal of strain AG1319 (PazuC azuC-msfgfp). This study is the first report to demonstrate the genetic response of bacterial cells under 1 MPa hydrostatic pressure, and provides preliminary data for creating pressure sensing bacterial strains for a wide range of applications."

Records of the patients who underwent thyroidectomy with prophylactic central lymph node dissection due to clinically node negative PTC (size, 1.0–3.0 cm) were reviewed. Of a total of 174 patients, 71 (40.8%) had CLNMs. CLNM was more associated with capsule invasion than capsule non-invasion on ultrasonography (68.4% vs. 37.4%, p = 0.009). In the 155 patients without capsule invasion, a distance from the capsule < 1.9 mm was associated with CLNM in univariable (p = 0.002) and multivariable analysis (p < 0.001). Any PTC patient with a distance from the capsule ≥ 1.9 mm did not have CLNM whereas 40.8% (58/142) of PTC patients with a distance from the capsule < 1.9 mm had CLNM. CLNM was not associated with age, gender, or tumor size on ultrasonography. Distance from capsule ≥ 1.9 mm on preoperative ultrasonography was a significant indicator for not having CLNM in clinically node negative PTC patients. Measuring distance from the capsule on preoperative ultrasonography images could help select patients with PTC who could benefit from prophylactic central lymph node dissection."
https://openalex.org/W2884798178,"Fat storage–inducing transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) aids in partitioning of cellular triacylglycerol into lipid droplets. A genome-wide association study reported FITM2-R3H domain containing like-HNF4A locus to be associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in East Asian populations. Mice with adipose tissue (AT)-specific FIT2 knockout exhibited lipodystrophic features, with reduced AT mass, insulin resistance, and greater inflammation in AT when fed a high-fat diet. The role of FIT2 in regulating human adipocyte function is not known. Here, we found FIT2 protein abundance is lower in subcutaneous and omental AT obtained from patients with T2DM compared with nondiabetic control subjects. Partial loss of FIT2 protein in primary human adipocytes attenuated their lipid storage capacity and induced insulin resistance. After palmitate treatment, triacylglycerol accumulation, insulininduced Akt (Ser-473) phosphorylation, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake were significantly reduced in FIT2 knockdown adipocytes compared with control cells. Gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-6 and phosphorylation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker inositol-requiring enzyme la were greater in FIT2 knockdown adipocytes than in control cells. Our results show for the first time that FIT2 is associated with T2DM in humans and plays an integral role in maintaining metabolically healthy AT function.—Agrawal, M., Yeo, C.

https://openalex.org/W2883472814,"Background Alcohol craving, a known correlate of vulnerability to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), has been found to be inversely related to cardiac vagal tone (CVT). Here we examine how resting CVT, CVT reactivity to a postural challenge, and their interaction influence craving during imposed alcohol abstinence and their usual drinking among moderate to heavy drinkers. Methods Participants were recruited from the local community (final n = 29) and assessed for CVT functioning via respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) at rest (RSA-rest) and during a postural challenge (RSA-react). Craving intensity was assessed throughout the day during 3-day periods of imposed alcohol abstinence (abstained days) and drinking as usual (normal days) via Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). Multilevel statistical modeling assessed relationships between patterns of CVT and diurnal craving. The primary hypothesis of interest was that the interaction of RSA-rest with RSA-react would be significantly associated with increased craving across the day. Results Overall, craving increased throughout the day and significantly decreased after drinking (p < 0.001). There was a significant interaction between RSA-rest and RSA-react with plots revealing that this effect was driven by an aberrant craving pattern among participants with higher RSA-rest and a sluggish vagal brake in response to a postural shift—atypical RSA-react. Conclusion Although additional research is needed to corroborate these findings, our results suggest that moderate-heavy drinkers characterized by higher RSA-rest and atypical RSA-react exhibit aberrant patterns of craving across the day that may represent a risk factor for AUD."
https://openalex.org/W2883904992,"Stroke effects millions of people each year and can have a significant impact on the ability to use the impaired arm and hand. One of the results of stroke is the development of an abnormal shoulder-elbow flexion synergy, where lifting the arm can cause the elbow, wrist, and finger flexors to involuntarily contract, reducing the ability to reach with the arm and hand opening. This study explored the effect of using support at the upper arm to improve hand and arm reaching performance. Nine participants were studied while performing a virtual reaching task under three conditions: while the weight of their impaired arm was supported by a robot arm, while unsupported, and while using their non-impaired arm. Most subjects exhibited faster and more accurate reaching while supported compared to unsupported. For the subjects who could voluntarily open their hand, most were able to more swiftly open their hand when using upper arm support. In many cases, performance with support was not statistically different than the unaffected arm and hand. Muscle activity of the impaired limb with upper arm support showed decreased effort to lift the arm and reduced biceps activity in most subjects, pointing to a reduction in the abnormal flexion synergy while using upper arm support. While arm support can help to reduce the activation of abnormal synergies, weakness resulting from hemiparesis remains an issue impacting performance. Future systems will need to address both of these causes of disability to more fully restore function after stroke."

If general practitioners (GPs) are unaware of such complaints, this could lead to a mismatch in provided care and needed or expected care. In this qualitative study with community-dwelling older persons we investigated how older persons experience hindering health complaints, how they deal with them, and what they expect from their GP.Participants (aged ≥80 years) with pain and/or problems with walking/standing were invited to participate in a (group)interview about hindering health problems and expectations from general practice. Data were analysed using the framework method and results were discussed with a client panel.Participants experienced various hindering health complaints in addition to pain and/or problems with walking/standing. Complaints affecting social activities were experienced as the most hindering. Participants actively tried to remain independent and, to achieve this, GPs were expected to be involved and be easily accessible. However, they did not expect specific help from their GP for pain or problems with walking/standing. Suggestions for improvement of care from GPs included optimisation of accessibility (continuous availability by telephone), a yearly check including medication review, open communication, and empathy and support during major life events.According to older persons with hindering health complaints, GPs could improve their accessibility/relationship with patients by: 1) continuous telephonic availability, 2) initiating regular contact with medication reviews, and 3) initiating support during major life events. This might lower the reported barriers to contact the GP for hindering health complaints."

Given the potential therapeutic efficacy of fosfomycin against Campylobacter spp., the aim of the present study was to determine the in vitro fosfomycin susceptibility of Campylobacter isolates from avian sources including poultry and wild birds. A total of eight (1.8%) strains of Campylobacter including five C. jejuni strains isolated from ducks and three C. coli strains isolated from chickens and duck showed resistance to fosfomycin, with MICs ranging from 64 to ≥ 256 μg/mL. The extent of fosfomycin resistance was 0%, 0.9% and 3.9% in wild birds, chicken and ducks respectively. The MIC50, MIC90, and MIC100 values were 8, 32, and 32 μg/mL respectively in wild bird, 32, 32, and 64 μg/mL respectively in chicken, and 32, 32, and ≥ 256 μg/mL respectively in ducks. All eight fosfomycin-resistant Campylobacter strains were multidrug resistant; six were also resistant to fluoroquinolones, ampicillin, and tetracycline, and two were also resistant to fluoroquinolones, ampicillin, tetracycline, and macrolides. However, the fosfomycin resistance gene fosXCC was not detected in the eight fosfomycin-resistant strains. Because food animals can harbor fosfomycin-resistant Campylobacter and transmit them to humans, greater efforts are needed to monitor the prevalence of fosfomycin resistance in Campylobacter strains isolated from such animals."
https://openalex.org/W2883193089,"Endonucleases of the HUH family are specialized in processing single-stranded DNA in a variety of evolutionarily highly conserved biological processes related to mobile genetic elements. They share a structurally defined catalytic domain for site-specific nicking and strand-transfer reactions, which is often linked to the activities of additional functional domains, contributing to their overall versatility. To assess if these HUH domains could be interchanged, we created a chimeric protein from two distantly related HUH endonucleases, containing the N-terminal HUH domain of the bacterial conjugative relaxase TrwC and the C-terminal DNA helicase domain of the human adeno-associated virus (AAV) replicase and site-specific integrase. The purified chimeric protein retained oligomerization properties and DNA helicase activities similar to Rep68, while its DNA binding specificity and cleaving-joining activity at oriT was similar to TrwC. Interestingly, the chimeric protein could catalyse site-specific integration in bacteria with an efficiency comparable to that of TrwC, while the HUH domain of TrwC alone was unable to catalyze this reaction, implying that the Rep68 C-terminal helicase domain is complementing the TrwC HUH domain to achieve site-specific integration into TrwC targets in bacteria. Our results illustrate how HUH domains could have acquired through evolution other domains in order to attain new roles, contributing to the functional flexibility observed in this protein superfamily."
