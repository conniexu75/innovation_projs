https://openalex.org/W2041357689,"Analysis of the Greenland ice core covering the period from 3000 to 500 years ago-the Greek, Roman, Medieval and Renaissance times-shows that lead is present at concentrations four times as great as natural values from about 2500 to 1700 years ago (500 B.C. to 300 A.D.). These results show that Greek and Roman lead and silver mining and smelting activities polluted the middle troposphere of the Northern Hemisphere on a hemispheric scale two millennia ago, long before the Industrial Revolution. Cumulative lead fallout to the Greenland Ice Sheet during these eight centuries was as high as 15 percent of that caused by the massive use of lead alkyl additives in gasoline since the 1930s. Pronounced lead pollution is also observed during Medieval and Renaissance times."
https://openalex.org/W2066446660,"In oceanic, coastal, and estuarine environments, an average of 25 to 41 percent of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (NH(4) (+) and NO(3) (-)) taken up by phytoplankton is released as dissolved organic nitrogen (DON). Release rates for DON in oceanic systems range from 4 to 26 nanogram-atoms of nitrogen per liter per hour. Failure to account for the production of DON during nitrogen-15 uptake experiments results in an underestimate of gross nitrogen uptake rates and thus an underestimate of new and regenerated production. In these studies, traditional nitrogen-15 techniques were found to underestimate new and regenerated production by up to 74 and 50 percent, respectively. Total DON turnover times, estimated from DON release resulting from both NH(4) (+) and NO(3) (-) uptake, were 10 +/- 1, 18 +/- 14, and 4 days for oceanic, coastal, and estuarine sites, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2085219180,"Highly vibrationally excited O(2)(X(3)sigmag(-), v >/= 26) has been observed from the photodissociation of ozone (O(3)), and the quantum yield for this reaction has been determined for excitation at 226 nanometers. This observation may help to address the ""ozone deficit"" problem, or why the previously predicted stratospheric O(3) concentration is less than that observed. Recent kinetic studies have suggested that O(2)(X(3)sigmag(-), v >/= 26) can react rapidly with O(2) to form O(3) + O and have led to speculation that, if produced in the photodissociation of O(3), this species might be involved in resolving the discrepancy. The sequence O(3) + hv --> O(2)(X(3)sigmag(-), v >/= 26) + O; O(2)(X(3)sigmag(-), v >/= 26) + O(2) --> O(3) + O (where hv is a photon) would be an autocatalytic mechanism for production of odd oxygen. A two-dimensional atmospheric model has been used to evaluate the importance of this new mechanism. The new mechanism can completely account for the tropical O(3) deficit at an altitude of 43 kilometers, but it does not completely account for the deficit at higher altitudes. The mechanism also provides for isotopic fractionation and may contribute to an explanation for the anomalously high concentration of heavy O(3) in the stratosphere."

To induce surface nucleation and oriented growth of AIPO4-5 crystals, organophosphonate layers cross-linked with Zr(IV) were assembled on a gold substrate and the modified substrate was immersed in a hydrothermal bath containing reagents for the synthesis of the molecular sieve. Reflection-absorption infrared studies demonstrated the stability of the phosphonate layers under these conditions. Drastic changes in the morphology of the surface-grown crystals from spherical agglomerates to vertical needles to thin tilted needles could be achieved by adjusting the water content of the synthesis bath. Nitrogen sorption in these structures on a piezoelectric device confirmed the presence of zeolitic microporosity."

https://openalex.org/W2083623119,"Industrialized nations now devote a substantial amount of atmospheric research to studies of ozone photochemistry. However relatively little attention has been paid to the details of how atmospheric ozone is created. Miller proposes a mechanism for atmospheric ozone production - reaction between highly vibrationally excited O2 and groundstate O2 - that may have relevance to the overall ozone balance. This article describes the interaction and discusses its implications. 14 refs., 1 fig."

https://openalex.org/W2092818865,"Depending on the sign of the spin temperature in the picokelvin range, antiferromagnetic nuclear and ferromagnetic nuclear orders in silver are caused by the same interactions. In rhodium, the antiferromagnetic state is preferred both at temperatures greater than and temperatures less than zero. The lowest and ""highest"" temperatures ever produced on this scale and measured, 280 and -750 picokelvin, respectively, have been reached in the course of these experiments. The results on silver, in particular, show that negative temperatures are real, not fictitious, quantities."
