https://openalex.org/W2095410318,"Quantum entanglement between spatially separated objects is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics. The outcomes of independent measurements on entangled objects show correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics. Besides being of fundamental interest, entanglement is a unique resource for quantum information processing and communication. Entangled qubits can be used to establish private information or implement quantum logical gates. Such capabilities are particularly useful when the entangled qubits are spatially separated, opening the opportunity to create highly connected quantum networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we present a key experiment towards the realization of long-distance quantum networks with solid-state quantum registers. We have entangled two electron spin qubits in diamond that are separated by a three-meter distance. We establish this entanglement using a robust protocol based on local creation of spin-photon entanglement and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state. We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved initialization, readout and entanglement operations on local long-lived nuclear spin registers, enabling deterministic long-distance teleportation, quantum repeaters and extended quantum networks."
https://openalex.org/W2085567058,"Transcript function is determined by sequence elements arranged on an individual RNA molecule. Variation in transcripts can affect messenger RNA stability, localization and translation, or produce truncated proteins that differ in localization or function. Given the existence of overlapping, variable transcript isoforms, determining the functional impact of the transcriptome requires identification of full-length transcripts, rather than just the genomic regions that are transcribed. Here, by jointly determining both transcript ends for millions of RNA molecules, we reveal an extensive layer of isoform diversity previously hidden among overlapping RNA molecules. Variation in transcript boundaries seems to be the rule rather than the exception, even within a single population of yeast cells. Over 26 major transcript isoforms per protein-coding gene were expressed in yeast. Hundreds of short coding RNAs and truncated versions of proteins are concomitantly encoded by alternative transcript isoforms, increasing protein diversity. In addition, approximately 70% of genes express alternative isoforms that vary in post-transcriptional regulatory elements, and tandem genes frequently produce overlapping or even bicistronic transcripts. This extensive transcript diversity is generated by a relatively simple eukaryotic genome with limited splicing, and within a genetically homogeneous population of cells. Our findings have implications for genome compaction, evolution and phenotypic diversity between single cells. These data also indicate that isoform diversity as well as RNA abundance should be considered when assessing the functional repertoire of genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2004437322,"In Drosophila, olfactory sensory neurons project to spatially invariant loci (glomeruli) and stereotyped circuitry is maintained in projections to a brain centre thought to mediate innate behaviours; here it is shown that neurons of the mushroom body, a centre that translates olfactory information into learned behaviours, integrate input from an apparently random combination of glomeruli, which could allow the fly to contextualize novel sensory experiences. Some odours elicit fixed, innate behavioural responses, based on stereotyped neuronal circuits — or 'labelled lines' — that form direct links to the deeper layers of the brain. It has been suggested that less stereotyped circuits allow other odours to acquire their behavioural 'valence' based on individual experience, but such randomness is harder to demonstrate than structure. Now Richard Axel and colleagues have used sophisticated tracing of neural connectivity in the fruitfly to show that projections from the peripheral olfactory system to the associative memory centre in the mushroom bodies are largely random, which may allow the animal to contextualize new sensory experiences. The mushroom body in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster is an associative brain centre that translates odour representations into learned behavioural responses1. Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body, integrate input from olfactory glomeruli to encode odours as sparse distributed patterns of neural activity2,3. We have developed anatomic tracing techniques to identify the glomerular origin of the inputs that converge onto 200 individual Kenyon cells. Here we show that each Kenyon cell integrates input from a different and apparently random combination of glomeruli. The glomerular inputs to individual Kenyon cells show no discernible organization with respect to their odour tuning, anatomic features or developmental origins. Moreover, different classes of Kenyon cells do not seem to preferentially integrate inputs from specific combinations of glomeruli. This organization of glomerular connections to the mushroom body could allow the fly to contextualize novel sensory experiences, a feature consistent with the role of this brain centre in mediating learned olfactory associations and behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W1988896202,"This paper identifies a specific population of subventricular-zone-generated astrocytes that increases in population density after cortical injury; these activated astrocytes migrate to the site of injury, unlike described properties for their counterparts residing in the cortex. The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the rodent brain is known to host precursor cells that can generate neurons or glia, depending on the microenvironment. The question arises, might activating this niche following brain injury play a role in tissue repair? Here, Chay Kuo and colleagues identify a specific population of SVZ-generated astrocytes in mice that increases in number post-injury. These activated astrocytes migrate to the site of injury, unlike their cortex-generated counterparts. This robust post-injury response requires Notch signalling, and when this population of astrocytes is disrupted tissue recovery is compromised. Postnatal/adult neural stem cells (NSCs) within the rodent subventricular zone (SVZ; also called subependymal zone) generate doublecortin (Dcx)+ neuroblasts that migrate and integrate into olfactory bulb circuitry1,2. Continuous production of neuroblasts is controlled by the SVZ microenvironmental niche3,4. It is generally thought that enhancing the neurogenic activities of endogenous NSCs may provide needed therapeutic options for disease states and after brain injury. However, SVZ NSCs can also differentiate into astrocytes. It remains unclear whether there are conditions that favour astrogenesis over neurogenesis in the SVZ niche, and whether astrocytes produced there have different properties compared with astrocytes produced elsewhere in the brain5. Here we show in mice that SVZ-generated astrocytes express high levels of thrombospondin 4 (Thbs4)6,7, a secreted homopentameric glycoprotein, in contrast to cortical astrocytes, which express low levels of Thbs4. We found that localized photothrombotic/ischaemic cortical injury initiates a marked increase in Thbs4hi astrocyte production from the postnatal SVZ niche. Tamoxifen-inducible nestin-creERtm4 lineage tracing demonstrated that it is these SVZ-generated Thbs4hi astrocytes, and not Dcx+ neuroblasts, that home-in on the injured cortex. This robust post-injury astrogenic response required SVZ Notch activation modulated by Thbs4 via direct Notch1 receptor binding and endocytosis to activate downstream signals, including increased Nfia transcription factor expression important for glia production8. Consequently, Thbs4 homozygous knockout mice (Thbs4KO/KO) showed severe defects in cortical-injury-induced SVZ astrogenesis, instead producing cells expressing Dcx migrating from SVZ to the injury sites. These alterations in cellular responses resulted in abnormal glial scar formation after injury, and significantly increased microvascular haemorrhage into the brain parenchyma of Thbs4KO/KO mice. Taken together, these findings have important implications for post-injury applications of endogenous and transplanted NSCs in the therapeutic setting, as well as disease states where Thbs family members have important roles9,10."
https://openalex.org/W2080689645,"Skeletal muscle arises from the fusion of precursor myoblasts into multinucleated myofibres. Although conserved transcription factors and signalling proteins involved in myogenesis have been identified, upstream regulators are less well understood. Here we report an unexpected discovery that the membrane protein BAI1, previously linked to recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, promotes myoblast fusion. Endogenous BAI1 expression increased during myoblast fusion, and BAI1 overexpression enhanced myoblast fusion by means of signalling through ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 proteins. During myoblast fusion, a fraction of myoblasts within the population underwent apoptosis and exposed phosphatidylserine, an established ligand for BAI1 (ref. 3). Blocking apoptosis potently impaired myoblast fusion, and adding back apoptotic myoblasts restored fusion. Furthermore, primary human myoblasts could be induced to form myotubes by adding apoptotic myoblasts, even under normal growth conditions. Mechanistically, apoptotic cells did not directly fuse with the healthy myoblasts, rather the apoptotic cells induced a contact-dependent signalling with neighbours to promote fusion among the healthy myoblasts. In vivo, myofibres from Bai1(-/-) mice are smaller than those from wild-type littermates. Muscle regeneration after injury was also impaired in Bai1(-/-)mice, highlighting a role for BAI1 in mammalian myogenesis. Collectively, these data identify apoptotic cells as a new type of cue that induces signalling via the phosphatidylserine receptor BAI1 to promote fusion of healthy myoblasts, with important implications for muscle development and repair."
https://openalex.org/W2049228937,"The fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda is an economically important pest of small grain crops that occurs in all maize growing regions of the Americas. The intensive use of chemical pesticides for its control has led to the selection of resistant populations, however, to date, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance have not been characterised. In this study the mechanisms involved in the resistance of two S. frugiperda strains collected in Brazil to chlorpyrifos (OP strain) or lambda-cyhalothrin (PYR strain) were investigated using molecular and genomic approaches. To examine the possible role of target-site insensitivity the genes encoding the organophosphate (acetylcholinesterase, AChE) and pyrethroid (voltage-gated sodium channel, VGSC) target-site proteins were PCR amplified. Sequencing of the S. frugiperda ace-1 gene identified several nucleotide changes in the OP strain when compared to a susceptible reference strain (SUS). These result in three amino acid substitutions, A201S, G227A and F290V, that have all been shown previously to confer organophosphate resistance in several other insect species. Sequencing of the gene encoding the VGSC in the PYR strain, identified mutations that result in three amino acid substitutions, T929I, L932F and L1014F, all of which have been shown previously to confer knockdown/super knockdown-type resistance in several arthropod species. To investigate the possible role of metabolic detoxification in the resistant phenotype of the OP and PYR stains all EST sequences available for S. frugiperda were used to design a gene-expression microarray. This was then used to compare gene expression in the resistant strains with the susceptible reference strain. Members of several gene families, previously implicated in metabolic resistance in other insects were found to be overexpressed in the resistant strains including glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450s and carboxylesterases. Taken together these results provide evidence that both target-site and metabolic mechanisms underlie the resistance of S. frugiperda to pyrethroids and organophosphates."
https://openalex.org/W2047128135,"Extracellular polysaccharides are major immunogenic components of the bacterial cell envelope. However, little is known about their biosynthesis in the genus Acinetobacter, which includes A. baumannii, an important nosocomial pathogen. Whether Acinetobacter sp. produce a capsule or a lipopolysaccharide carrying an O antigen or both is not resolved. To explore these issues, genes involved in the synthesis of complex polysaccharides were located in 10 complete A. baumannii genome sequences, and the function of each of their products was predicted via comparison to enzymes with a known function. The absence of a gene encoding a WaaL ligase, required to link the carbohydrate polymer to the lipid A-core oligosaccharide (lipooligosaccharide) forming lipopolysaccharide, suggests that only a capsule is produced. Nine distinct arrangements of a large capsule biosynthesis locus, designated KL1 to KL9, were found in the genomes. Three forms of a second, smaller variable locus, likely to be required for synthesis of the outer core of the lipid A-core moiety, were designated OCL1 to OCL3 and also annotated. Each K locus includes genes for capsule export as well as genes for synthesis of activated sugar precursors, and for glycosyltransfer, glycan modification and oligosaccharide repeat-unit processing. The K loci all include the export genes at one end and genes for synthesis of common sugar precursors at the other, with a highly variable region that includes the remaining genes in between. Five different capsule loci, KL2, KL6, KL7, KL8 and KL9 were detected in multiply antibiotic resistant isolates belonging to global clone 2, and two other loci, KL1 and KL4, in global clone 1. This indicates that this region is being substituted repeatedly in multiply antibiotic resistant isolates from these clones."
https://openalex.org/W2079655614,"Building on previous work that identified a mutant avian H5 virus that is transmissible between ferrets, the authors present an algorithm to predict virus avidity from the affinity of single haemagglutinin (HA)–receptor interactions; these studies predict that the mutant has a 200-fold preference for the human over the avian receptor, and crystal structures of the mutant HA in complex with human and avian receptors shed light on the molecular basis for these altered binding properties. The recent identification of an avian H5 haemagglutinin (HA) that can mediate aerosol transmission in ferrets when incorporated into a human influenza virus backbone has provided a model in which the nature of transmission of this type of virus can be closely examined. This new study goes further in demonstrating that this same transmissible-mutant virus has acquired a small increase in affinity for the human receptor, but a marked decrease in affinity for the avian receptor, leading to a 200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The authors provide a crystal structure of this mutant HA in complex with human and avian receptor analogues, revealing something of the molecular basis for the altered binding properties. Cell-surface-receptor binding by influenza viruses is a key determinant of their transmissibility, both from avian and animal species to humans as well as from human to human. Highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses that are a threat to public health have been observed to acquire affinity for human receptors, and transmissible-mutant-selection experiments have identified a virus that is transmissible in ferrets1,2,3, the generally accepted experimental model for influenza in humans. Here, our quantitative biophysical measurements of the receptor-binding properties of haemagglutinin (HA) from the transmissible mutant indicate a small increase in affinity for human receptor and a marked decrease in affinity for avian receptor. From analysis of virus and HA binding data we have derived an algorithm that predicts virus avidity from the affinity of individual HA–receptor interactions. It reveals that the transmissible-mutant virus has a 200-fold preference for binding human over avian receptors. The crystal structure of the transmissible-mutant HA in complex with receptor analogues shows that it has acquired the ability to bind human receptor in the same folded-back conformation as seen for HA from the 1918, 1957 (ref. 4), 1968 (ref. 5) and 2009 (ref. 6) pandemic viruses. This binding mode is substantially different from that by which non-transmissible wild-type H5 virus HA binds human receptor. The structure of the complex also explains how the change in preference from avian to human receptors arises from the Gln226Leu substitution, which facilitates binding to human receptor but restricts binding to avian receptor. Both features probably contribute to the acquisition of transmissibility by this mutant virus."
https://openalex.org/W1964093149,"Background The epidemiology of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is not well illustrated, particularly for Asian countries. Methods The age-standardized incidence rates and observed survival rates of NETs diagnosed in Taiwan from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2008 were calculated using data of the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) and compared to those of the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC) and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Results During the study period, a total of 2,187 NET cases were diagnosed in Taiwan, with 62% males and a mean age of 57.9 years-old. The age-standardized incidence rate of NETs increased from 0.30 per 100,000 in 1996 to 1.51 per 100,000 in 2008. The most common primary sites were rectum (25.4%), lung and bronchus (20%) and stomach (7.4%). The 5-year observed survival was 50.4% for all NETs (43.4% for men and 61.8% for women, P<0.0001). The best 5-year observed survivals for NETs by sites were rectum (80.9%), appendix (75.7%), and breast (64.8%). Conclusions Compared to the data of Norway and the US, the age-standardized incidence rate of NETs in Taiwan is lower and the major primary sites are different, whereas the long-term outcome is similar. More studies on the pathogenesis of NETs are warranted to devise preventive strategies and improve treatment outcomes for NETs."
https://openalex.org/W1993463286,"Background Prevention and control of hypertension are critical in reducing morbidity and mortality attributable to cardiovascular diseases. Awareness of hypertension is a pre-condition for control and prevention. This study estimated the proportion of adults who were hypertensive, were aware of their hypertension and those that achieved adequate control. Methods We conducted a community based cross sectional survey among people≥15 years in Buikwe and Mukono districts of Uganda. People had their blood pressure measured and were interviewed about their social-demographic characteristics. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, or previous diagnosis of hypertension. Participants were classified as hypertensive aware if they reported that they had previously been informed by a health professional that they had hypertension. Control of hypertension among those aware was if systolic blood pressure was <140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was <90 mmHg. Results The age standardized prevalence of hypertension was 27.2% (95% CI 25.9–28.5) similar among females (27.7%) and males (26.4%). Prevalence increased linearly with age, and age effect was more marked among females. Among the hypertensive participants, awareness was 28.2% (95% CI 25.4–31.0) higher among females (37.0%) compared to males (12.4%). Only 9.4% (95% CI 7.5–11.1) of all hypertensive participants were controlled. Control was higher among females (13.2%) compared to males (2.5%). Conclusion More than a quarter of the adult population had hypertension but awareness and control was very low. Measures are needed to enhance control, awareness and prevention of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2095233827,"Estimations of body shape and three-dimensional digital reconstructions of representative archosaurs along the ancestral bird line support hypotheses of a gradual, stepwise acquisition of more-crouched limb postures across much of theropod evolution but indicate that an accelerated change, rather than a discrete transition from more-upright postures, occurred within the clade Maniraptora (birds and their closest relatives, such as deinonychosaurs). Three-dimensional digital reconstructions of birds and dinosaur species successively more closely related to them have allowed John Hutchinson and colleagues to establish how and when the 'dinosaurian' body plan transformed into the typical 'avian' body plan. Birds have adopted a uniquely crouched hindlimb posture. Reconstructions of 17 archosaur species — including whole skeletons and bodies of Chinese fossil birds, Velociraptor and Archaeopteryx — indicate a gradual, stepwise acquisition of more-crouched limb postures across much of theropod evolution, with more rapid change in the maniraptorans (true birds and their immediate deinonychosaur relatives). Skeletal changes imply that pectoral limb modifications were important in shifting the mechanical balance of the body and hence the transformation of two key behaviours of birds — bipedalism and flight. Locomotion in living birds (Neornithes) has two remarkable features: feather-assisted flight, and the use of unusually crouched hindlimbs for bipedal support and movement. When and how these defining functional traits evolved remains controversial1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the advent of computer modelling approaches and the discoveries of exceptionally preserved key specimens now make it possible to use quantitative data on whole-body morphology to address the biomechanics underlying this issue. Here we use digital body reconstructions to quantify evolutionary trends in locomotor biomechanics (whole-body proportions and centre-of-mass position) across the clade Archosauria. We use three-dimensional digital reconstruction to estimate body shape from skeletal dimensions for 17 archosaurs along the ancestral bird line, including the exceptionally preserved, feathered taxa Microraptor, Archaeopteryx, Pengornis and Yixianornis, which represent key stages in the evolution of the avian body plan. Rather than a discrete transition from more-upright postures in the basal-most birds (Avialae) and their immediate outgroup deinonychosauria5,6, our results support hypotheses of a gradual, stepwise acquisition of more-crouched limb postures across much of theropod evolution1,2,3,4, although we find evidence of an accelerated change within the clade Maniraptora (birds and their closest relatives, such as deinonychosaurs). In addition, whereas reduction of the tail is widely accepted to be the primary morphological factor correlated with centre-of-mass position and, hence, evolution of hindlimb posture1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, we instead find that enlargement of the pectoral limb and several associated trends have a much stronger influence. Intriguingly, our support for the onset of accelerated morpho-functional trends within Maniraptora is closely correlated with the evolution of flight. Because we find that the evolution of enlarged forelimbs is strongly linked, via whole-body centre of mass, to hindlimb function during terrestrial locomotion, we suggest that the evolution of avian flight is linked to anatomical novelties in the pelvic limb as well as the pectoral."
https://openalex.org/W2078781685,"Background Expansins are proteins that loosen plant cell walls in a pH-dependent manner, probably by increasing the relative movement among polymers thus causing irreversible expansion. The expansin superfamily (EXP) comprises four distinct families: expansin A (EXPA), expansin B (EXPB), expansin-like A (EXLA) and expansin-like B (EXLB). There is experimental evidence that EXPA and EXPB proteins are required for cell expansion and developmental processes involving cell wall modification, whereas the exact functions of EXLA and EXLB remain unclear. The complete grapevine (Vitis vinifera) genome sequence has allowed the characterization of many gene families, but an exhaustive genome-wide analysis of expansin gene expression has not been attempted thus far. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified 29 EXP superfamily genes in the grapevine genome, representing all four EXP families. Members of the same EXP family shared the same exon–intron structure, and phylogenetic analysis confirmed a closer relationship between EXP genes from woody species, i.e. grapevine and poplar (Populus trichocarpa), compared to those from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). We also identified grapevine-specific duplication events involving the EXLB family. Global gene expression analysis confirmed a strong correlation among EXP genes expressed in mature and green/vegetative samples, respectively, as reported for other gene families in the recently-published grapevine gene expression atlas. We also observed the specific co-expression of EXLB genes in woody organs, and the involvement of certain grapevine EXP genes in berry development and post-harvest withering. Conclusion Our comprehensive analysis of the grapevine EXP superfamily confirmed and extended current knowledge about the structural and functional characteristics of this gene family, and also identified properties that are currently unique to grapevine expansin genes. Our data provide a model for the functional characterization of grapevine gene families by combining phylogenetic analysis with global gene expression profiling."

Selection of viral strains under ALLINI pressure has revealed an A128T substitution in HIV-1 IN as a primary mechanism of resistance. Here, we elucidated the structural and mechanistic basis for this resistance. The A128T substitution did not affect the hydrogen bonding between ALLINI and IN that mimics the IN-LEDGF/p75 interaction but instead altered the positioning of the inhibitor at the IN dimer interface.

The cornerstone of this protein-protein interaction is a hydrogen bonding network between the side chain oxygen atoms of LEDGF/p75 Asp-366 and the IN backbone amides of Glu-170 and His-171 (10Hare S.

Using a structure-based rational drug design approach, Christ et al. (12Christ F. Voet A. Marchand A. Nicolet S. Desimmie B.A. Marchand D. Bardiot D. Van der Veken N.J. Van Remoortel B. Strelkov S.V.

Paradoxically, the identical class of compounds has emerged from a high-throughput screen for IN 3′-processing activity (13.Tsantrizos, Y. S., Boes, M., Brochu, C., Fenwick, C., Malenfant, E., Mason, S., Pesant, M., (November 22, 2007) Inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus replication. International Patent PCT/CA2007/000845,Google Scholar). Subsequent studies from our group and others demonstrated that 2-(quinolin-3-yl)acetic acid derivatives exhibit a multimodal mechanism of action by allosterically modulating the IN structure, which affects both IN-LEDGF/p75 binding and catalytic activity (14Kessl J.J.

Accordingly, we have proposed to name this class of inhibitors as allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs). Structural studies have shown that the carboxylic acid of ALLINIs hydrogen bonds with the backbone amides of Glu-170 and His-171 and thus occupy the principal LEDGF/p75-binding interface (12Christ F.

At the same time, the quinoline core and the substituted phenyl group of the inhibitor bridge the two IN subunits and promote allosteric multimerization of the protein. As a result, ALLINIs potently inhibit both IN-LEDGF/p75 binding and LEDGF/p75-independent IN catalytic activities. The ability of ALLINIs to impair steps in the viral replication cycle that extend beyond IN catalytic function results in a highly cooperative inhibition of HIV-1 replication (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H. Slaughter A. Feng L. de Silva S. Wu L. Le Grice S.F. Engelman A. Fuchs J.R. Kvaratskhelia M.

Along these lines, it was recently reported that HIV-1 particles made in the presence of ALLINIs are noninfectious (15Christ F. Shaw S. Demeulemeester J. Desimmie B.A. Marchand A. Butler S. Smets W. Chaltin P. Westby M. Debyser Z. Pickford C.

Whereas the Food and Drug Administration-approved HIV-1 IN strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir (RAL) exhibits a Hill coefficient of 1, which is consistent with only a single or non-cooperative mode of action, ALLINIs impair viral replication with a Hill coefficient of ∼4, indicating a highly cooperative mode of action (14Kessl J.J.

Compounds with a high cooperativity are particularly desirable for superior clinical outcomes because they enable stronger viral suppression at clinical drug concentrations (17Shen L. Rabi S.A.

The A128T substitution in HIV-1 IN has been identified from cell culture assays as a primary mechanism for resistance to ALLINI compounds (12Christ F. Voet A. Marchand A. Nicolet S.

International Workshop on HIV and Hepatitis Virus Drug Resistance and Curative Strategies, Los Cabos, Mexico, June 7–11, 2011,Google Scholar). Ala-128 is located at the IN dimer interface in the pocket occupied by ALLINIs or LEDGF/p75. Here, we have investigated the structural and mechanistic properties for the resistance of A128T IN to ALLINIs. Strikingly, the A128T substitution only modestly affected ALLINI IC50 values for IN-LEDGF/p75 binding but markedly altered the multimerization of IN in the presence of the inhibitors. As a result, the catalytic activities of the WT protein were potently inhibited by ALLINIs, whereas A128T IN exhibited significant resistance to the inhibitor. Furthermore, considerably higher concentrations of ALLINIs were required to inhibit the infectivity of the A128T mutant virus compared with the WT counterpart. Taken together, our studies highlight that aberrant IN multimerization is the primary target of this class of inhibitors and thus provide the structural foundations for the development of second-generation ALLINIs with increased potency and decreased potential to select for drug resistance. ALLINI-1, referred to as BI-1001 previously, was synthesized as described (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H. Slaughter A. Feng L. de Silva S. Wu L. Le Grice S.F. Engelman A. Fuchs J.R.

RAL and saquinavir were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. LEDGF/p75 and WT and A128T HIV-1 IN recombinant proteins with His or FLAG tags were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H.

Homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based IN-LEDGF/p75 binding and IN multimerization assays were performed as described previously (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H.

WT IN was diluted to a final concentration of 100 nm in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg/ml BSA, and either 150 or 750 mm NaCl. Increasing concentrations of ALLINI-1 or ALLINI-2 were then added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was subjected to centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was washed three times with the same buffer. The supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and IN was detected with anti-His antibody (Abcam). Gel-based LEDGF/p75-dependent and LEDGF/p75-independent integration activity assays were performed as described previously (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H. Slaughter A.

The HTRF-based LEDGF/p75-dependent integration activity was measured by adding recombinant LEDGF/p75 protein to the assay mixture prior to the incubation with labeled DNA substrates. The time-resolved fluorescence signal was recorded using a PerkinElmer EnSpire multimode plate reader. Experiments were performed with a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) at 0.5 ml/min in elution buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 750 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 200 μm ZnCl2. IN (20 μm) was incubated with ALLINIs or Me2SO (control) for 30 min and then subjected to size exclusion chromatography. The column was calibrated with the following proteins: bovine thyroglobulin (670,000 Da), bovine γ-globulin (158,000 Da), chicken ovalbumin (44,000 Da), horse myoglobin (17,000 Da), and vitamin B12 (1,350 Da). Proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. All the procedures were performed at 4 °C. The HIV-1 IN CCD (residues 50–212 containing the F185K substitution) and A128T CCD (with an extra substitution of A128T) were expressed and purified as described (20Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M.

The CCD was concentrated to 8 mg/ml and crystallized at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization buffer contained 10% PEG 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, and 5 mm DTT. Crystals reached 0.1–0.2 mm within 4 weeks. The A128T CCD was concentrated to 8.5 mg/ml and crystallized at room temperature (20 °C) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization buffer contained 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 1.4 m sodium acetate, and 5 mm DTT. The crystals reached 0.2–0.4 mm within 1 week. A soaking buffer containing 5 mm ALLINI-1 or ALLINI-2 was prepared by dissolving the compound in crystallization buffer supplemented with 10% Me2SO. The protein crystal was soaked in the buffer for 8 h before flash-freezing in liquid N2. Diffraction data were collected at 100 F on a Rigaku R-AXIS 4++ image plate detector at the Ohio State University Crystallography Facility. Intensity data integration and reduction were performed using the HKL2000 program (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

HEK293T and HeLa TZM-bl cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (Invitrogen), 10% FBS (Invitrogen), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cultures of HEK293T cells (2 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate in 2 ml of complete medium) were transfected with 2 μg of pNL4–3 (WT or A128T mutant) at a 1:3 ratio of DNA to X-tremeGENE HP (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed once with complete medium, and the culture supernatant was replaced with complete medium containing Me2SO, RAL (250 nm), ALLINI-1, or ALLINI-2 (at the indicated concentrations). After 1 h, the culture supernatant was again replaced with fresh complete medium containing either Me2SO or the indicated inhibitors. The virus-containing cell-free supernatant was collected after 24 h, and HIV-1 Gag p24 ELISA (ZeptoMetrix) was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Virions equivalent to 2–4 ng of HIV-1 p24 was used to infect 2 × 105 HeLa TZM-bl cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). HeLa TZM-bl cultures were extracted in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and virion infectivity was measured using the luciferase assay (Promega). ALLINI EC50 values were determined in spreading HIV-1 replication assays as described previously (14Kessl J.J. Jena N. Koh Y. Taskent-Sezgin H. Slaughter A. Feng L. de Silva S. Wu L. Le Grice S.F.

To examine the effects of the A128T substitution on HIV-1 IN function, we compared the catalytic activities of purified recombinant WT and mutant proteins. The two proteins exhibited comparable levels of LEDGF/p75-independent and LEDGF/p75-dependent integration activities (Fig. 1). Thus, the A128T substitution does not significantly alter the function of IN. The A128T mutation has been shown to confer resistance to four different ALLINI compounds in cell culture assays (12Christ F. Voet A. Marchand A. Nicolet S. Desimmie B.A. Marchand D. Bardiot D.

Zúñiga E.I. Rosario D. García-Sastre A. de la Torre J.C. Inhibition of the type I interferon response by the nucleoprotein of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.J.

Differential inhibition of type I interferon induction by arenavirus nucleoproteins.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 12696-12703Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have provided strong evidence in the current study to show that the TCRV NP protein can also inhibit IFNs, which is contradictory to previous reports. NP is a multifunctional protein involved in viral genomic RNA encapsidation, viral RNA synthesis, and immune evasion. We reported the first crystal structure of a full-length LASV NP protein (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), which has uncovered a unique molecular mechanism of NP in mediating IFN suppression. Our structural, biochemical, and cell-based analyses have demonstrated that NP encodes a functional 3′-5′ exoribonuclease of the DEDDH family at its C terminus and that this RNase activity plays a strikingly important role in IFN suppression (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Our findings have subsequently been corroborated by an independent study on the structural and biochemical characterization of the C-terminal domain of LASV NP (9Hastie K.M. Kimberlin C.R. Zandonatti M.A. MacRae I.J. Saphire E.O. Structure of the Lassa virus nucleoprotein reveals a dsRNA-specific 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity essential for immune suppression.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2396-2401Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We proposed a novel immune evasion mechanism by which LASV NP preferentially degrades the immune stimulatory RNAs to avoid the induction of type I IFNs (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no other known host or viral RNase has a similar function in suppressing type I IFN induction. The closest equivalent would be the cellular DNA exonuclease Trex1, which inhibits innate immunity by degrading ssDNA and dsDNA templates that would otherwise be recognized by the cellular DNA sensors to induce IFN production (10Crow Y.J.

Trex1 prevents cell-intrinsic initiation of autoimmunity.Cell. 2008; 134: 587-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). How this unique exoribonuclease activity of LASV NP recognizes and degrades the immune-stimulatory RNAs to avoid IFN induction remains a mystery. While this manuscript was in preparation, a 2.9-Å structure of a catalytically inactive mutant version of LASV NP-C in complex with a dsRNA was reported (12Hastie K.M. King L.B. Zandonatti M.A. Saphire E.O. Structural basis for the dsRNA specificity of the Lassa virus NP exonuclease.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e44211Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At this resolution, however, it was not possible to visualize the sequence of the dsRNA and water molecules in the active site as well as to identify all possible side chain interactions. Additionally, using an inactive mutant enzyme limits the ability to understand how this unique exoribonuclease cleaves dsRNA. In the current study, we provide an atomic view of the intermediate conformation of the active 3′-5′ exoribonuclease domain of LASV NP in the process of degrading a 5′-triphosphate dsRNA template, which is a typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule. Together with the time course soaking crystallographic study, our structural analyses provide important and novel insights into the mechanism of this unique exoribonuclease in binding and cleaving its substrates. Furthermore, we have provided compelling structural, enzymatic, and biological data to demonstrate that, in contrast to a long-standing belief, the TCRV NP protein closely resembles LASV NP in the tertiary structure, exoribonuclease enzymatic activity, and the IFN suppressive function. Collectively, these data support a novel and unified model for arenaviruses to suppress IFN production via the unique exoribonuclease activity of viral NP protein. For bacterial cell expression of the LASV NP C-terminal domain (LASV NP-C), the fragment spanning residues 364 to 569 of LASV NP was subcloned into the pLou3 plasmid. The full-length TCRV NP gene was kindly provided by J. Nunberg, University of Montana. For bacterial expression of the TCRV NP-C domain, the fragment of residues 364 to 569 was cloned into the pHisTEV plasmid. For protein expression in mammalian cells, full-length LASV or the TCRV NP gene was cloned into the pCAGGS expression vector. 293T cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Full-length LASV NP and NP mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli from pLou3-based plasmids and purified as previously described (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). LASV NP-C protein was expressed in Rosetta cells after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 20 °C and purified as previously described (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). TCRV NP-C protein expression was induced overnight by 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C and purified through a nickel column followed by a gel filtration column. RNA oligos used in this study were either chemically synthesized (5′-hydroxylate, 5′-OH) or in vitro transcribed (5′-triphosphate, 5′-ppp) using the MEGAscript kit (Ambion). The dsRNA substrate used in the co-crystallization was generated by hybridization of an 8-nt 5′-triphosphate RNA oligo 5′-pppGGGCGCCCC-3′ by itself in a hybridization buffer that contains 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The 15-nt RNA oligos used in the in vitro RNase assay, 5′-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′, were chemically synthesized, and 5′ labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using a T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The LASV NP-C protein was mixed with the 5′-triphosphate dsRNA substrate at a 1:1 molar ratio on ice for 30 min. Although several dsRNAs of different sizes could form crystals with LASV NP-C, the best crystals were obtained with the 8-bp 5′-triphosphate dsRNA. These crystals were obtained in 18.5% PEG MME 5000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and 2.4% PEG MME350. Crystals of TCRV NP-C were grown in 32% PEG3350, 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.0, and 0.11 m ammonium citrate. The data were collected at beamlines IO2, IO3, and IO4 of Diamond light resources, processed using MOSFLM (13Battye T.G. Kontogiannis L. Johnson O.' Powell R. Leslie G., A Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The structures were evaluated using Molproperty and structural statistics are listed in Table 1. The crystals of NP-C coupled with dsRNA were soaked at room temperature in cryoprotectant containing 20% glycerol, 18.5% PEG MME 5000, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 2.4% PEG MME350, and 100 mm MnCl2 for 1, 1.5, 5, and 10 min, respectively. The crystals were frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection. The data collection, integration, and structural determination were performed as described above. Single, double, and triple point mutations were generated using either the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) or overlapped PCR. All the mutations have been confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 15-nt RNA oligo was 5′ labeled with 32P in a polynucleotide kinase reaction and unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passing through the Illustra MicroSpin G25 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The 5′ 32P-labeled RNA oligo was annealed with a 5-fold amount of unlabeled RNA oligos of either the same or the complementary oligo to form either ssRNA or dsRNA substrates. The exoribonuclease reaction contained 1 pmol of radiolabeled RNA substrates in either ss or ds forms and various concentrations of NP proteins (1 to 100 nm) in an RNase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to terminate the reaction. Radiolabeled RNA products were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, rapidly cooled on ice, separated in a 17% urea-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by exposure onto an x-ray film. Using a calcium phosphate transfection method, 293T cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of a plasmid that expresses the firefly luciferase (FLuc) gene from the IFN-β promoter (pIFNb-luc), different amounts (10 and 100 ng) of LASV NP or TCRV NP expression vectors, as well as 50 ng of the β-galactosidase (β-gal) expressing plasmid for normalization purpose. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with Sendai virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1 to induce IFN expression. At 24 h post-infection, cell lysates were prepared for luciferase and β-Gal assays (Promega). FLuc levels were normalized by β-Gal values. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Student's t test. To identify the preferred RNA substrates of LASV NP exoribonuclease, we first compared the efficiency of LASV NP in degrading ssRNA versus dsRNA substrates. Synthetic 15-nt RNA oligos were radiolabeled with 32P at the 5′ end, and incubated with unlabeled RNA oligos of either the same or complementary strand to form either ssRNA or dsRNA substrates. The in vitro exoribonuclease assay was conducted at a predetermined optimal condition (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) with various concentrations of full-length LASV NP, NP C-terminal domain (NP-C) of residues 364 to 569, and catalytic mutant D389A. NP and NP-C degraded dsRNA substrate at a much lower concentration than ssRNA (by at least 10-fold) (Fig. 1A). As a control, the NP-D389A mutant, in which the first aspartate of the catalytic residues (DEDDH) was changed to alanine, completely lost the ability to cleave any of the RNA species, which is consistent with our previous observation (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C. Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure.Nature. 2010; 468: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The integrity of the NP proteins during the in vitro RNase assay was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis of the proteins after 0 and 90 min incubation at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S1). Our data clearly demonstrate that dsRNA is the preferred substrate for NP RNase activity and that the NP-C domain alone has similar substrate selectivity and catalysis as the full-length protein. This dsRNA substrate preference of LASV NP exoribonuclease activity correlates well with the fact that dsRNA is a typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecule to induce type I IFN production (18Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Rehwinkel J. Kato H. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Way M. Schiavo G. Reis e Sousa C. Activation of MDA5 requires higher-order RNA structures generated during virus infection.J.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12067-12072Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for the NP RNase substrate selectivity and enzymatic mechanism, we attempted to co-crystallize the catalytically active LASV NP-C domain with different dsRNA substrates. We obtained crystals of NP-C in the presence of an 8-bp dsRNA oligo (5′-GGGCGCCC-3′/3′-CCCGCGGG-5′) with either 5′-OH or 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp), with the 5′-ppp dsRNA complex diffracted to a much higher resolution (1.68 Å). These crystals belong to a space group of P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 46.74 Å, b = 46.74 Å, c = 217.31 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°. The complex structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser (14Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G. McCoy A.

Single asymmetric unit cells contain one NP-C monomer bound to an RNA substrate (Fig. 2A). The electrostatic surface potential map shows that the dsRNA-binding surface, with a surface area of 606 Å2, is highly positively charged (Fig. 2B). Superimposition of Cα atoms of NP-C with and without RNA substrate (i.e. the current structure and one in the PDB 3MWP, respectively) showed highly similar overall structures, with a root mean square deviation of 0.8554 Å from residues 364 to 561 (supplemental Fig. 2). Nevertheless, in the presence of RNA substrate, the side chains of a few residues (e.g. Tyr-429, Arg-393, Asp-465, Lys-488, Arg-492, Ser-430, Gln-462, and Lys-469) showed significant conformational changes, suggesting their potential roles in substrate binding and processing. The five catalytic residues (Asp-389, Glu-391, His-522, Asp-466, and Asp-533) also showed some minor conformational changes. In addition, compared with the RNA-free NP structure (PDB 3MWP), residues 562 to 566 at the C-terminal end in the NP-C·dsRNA complex folded into an ordered conformation (supplemental Fig. S2). Electron density of the RNA substrate clearly showed the presence of 4 bp (5′-GGGC-3′/3′-CCCG-5′) in the catalytic cavity (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the 3′-5′ exonucleases Trex1 and Trex2 also contain 4 bases of their ssDNA substrates in the catalytic pockets (20Brucet M. Querol-Audí J. Serra M. Ramirez-Espain X. Bertlik K. Ruiz L.

DNA binding induces active site conformational change in the human TREX2 3′-exonuclease.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2411-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dsRNA substrate in the LASV NP-C catalytic site corresponds to the first 4 bp (5′-GGGC-3′/3′-CCCG-5′) of the input 8-bp dsRNA (5′-GGGCGCCC-3′/3′-CCCGCGGG-5′. For convenience, the 8-bp RNA is numbered as 5′-G1G2G3C4G5C6C7C8–3′ (Fig. 3A). This was because a catalytically active NP-C domain was used in the co-crystallization process and was predicted to have removed the last 4 nucleotides from the 3′ end of the cleaving strand, resulting in an intermediate dsRNA product with a 5′ protruding end of the complementary strand (5′-GGGC-3′/3′-CCCGCGGG-5′). The 4 nucleotides 5′-GGGC-3′ of the cleaving strand were almost completely buried in the catalytic cavity (Fig. 3A). Residues Asp-426, Glu-391, Asp-466, Gln-462, and Lys-488 in the cavity interacted directly with the cleaving stand, whereas other residues in the cavity coordinated the binding indirectly through water molecules (Fig. 3, A and B). Most of the residues interacting with the cleaving strand are phylogenetically conserved among arenaviruses, such as Gly-392, His-431, Glu-391, Asp-466, Gln-462, Arg-492, and Ser-430. In particular, the 3′-end ribonucleotide C at position 4 of the cleaving strand was coordinately anchored by several residues: Arg-492 through a water molecule forming a hydrogen bridge with the phosphate group, and Arg-426 and Glu-391 through their side chains forming a hydrogen bond with the 2′- and 3′-oxygen of the ribose of the cytosine ribonucleoside, respectively (Fig. 3B). Gln-462 and Asp-466 bound the guanine ribonucleotide (G) at the 3 position through the side chains forming a hydrogen bond with the phosphoryl oxygen and 2′-oxygen of the ribose (Fig. 3B). Lys-488 formed two salt bridges with the phosphates of the two Gs at the 3 and 2 positions, respectively (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, the 3′-CCCG-5′ nucleotides of the complementary strand were stacked against the aromatic side chain of Tyr-429 and were anchored by the side chains of residues Arg-393, Gln-425, Asp-426, Gln-422, and Asp-465, whereas the rest of the nucleotides of the complementary strand (3′-CGGG-5′) were exposed to solvent (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, residues involved in the complementary strand binding are not phylogenetically conserved. Remarkably, the 3′-end ribonucleotide C of the cleaving strand was positioned precisely in the deep pocket of the catalytic site, with the terminal bond of the ribonucleotide completely exposed to the catalytic residues for hydrolysis. This provides strong structural evidence for LASV NP being a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease as has recently been proposed (8Qi X. Lan S. Wang W. Schelde L.M. Dong H. Wallat G.D. Ly H. Liang Y. Dong C.

https://openalex.org/W2054502096,"Male moths can accurately perceive the sex pheromone emitted from conspecific females by their highly accurate and specific olfactory sensory system. Pheromone receptors are of special importance in moth pheromone reception because of their central role in chemosensory signal transduction processes that occur in olfactory receptor neurons in the male antennae. There are a number of pheromone receptor genes have been cloned, however, only a few have been functionally characterized. Here we cloned six full-length pheromone receptor genes from Helicoverpa armigera male antennae. Real-time PCR showing all genes exhibited male-biased expression in adult antennae. Functional analyses of the six pheromone receptor genes were then conducted in the heterologous expression system of Xenopus oocytes. HarmOR13 was found to be a specific receptor for the major sex pheromone component Z11-16:Ald. HarmOR6 was equally tuned to both of Z9-16: Ald and Z9-14: Ald. HarmOR16 was sensitively tuned to Z11-16: OH. HarmOR11, HarmOR14 and HarmOR15 failed to respond to the tested candidate pheromone compounds. Our experiments elucidated the functions of some pheromone receptor genes of H. armigera. These advances may provide remarkable evidence for intraspecific mating choice and speciation extension in moths at molecular level."
https://openalex.org/W1974405354,"Symptom screening is a recommended component of intensified case-finding (ICF) for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) among HIV-infected individuals. Symptomatic individuals are further investigated to either exclude or diagnose pulmonary TB, thus reducing the number of individuals requiring costly laboratory investigation. Those with laboratory evaluations negative for pulmonary TB or who lack symptoms may be eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) and/or TB isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). A four-part symptom screen has been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for identifying TB suspects and those unlikely to have TB. A meta-analysis of studies among HIV-infected individuals calculated a sensitivity of 90.1% for the four-part symptoms screen - of any of cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss - among patients in clinical care, making it an effective tool for identifying most patients with TB. An important population for intensified case-finding not included in that meta-analysis was HIV-infected pregnant women. We undertook a cross-sectional survey among HIV-infected pregnant women receiving prenatal care at community clinics in South Africa. We obtained a four-symptom review and sputum smear microscopy and mycobacterial culture on all participants. Among 1415 women, 226 (16%) had a positive symptom screen, and 35 (2.5%) were newly diagnosed with culture-positive TB. Twelve were on TB treatment at the time of screening, yielding 47 (3.3%) women with prevalent TB. Symptom screening among women without known TB had a sensitivity of 28% and specificity of 84%. The poor performance of symptom screening to identify women with TB suggests that other approaches may be needed for intensified case-finding to be effective for this population."
https://openalex.org/W2081889686,"Ecological indicators for monitoring strategies are expected to combine three major characteristics: ecological significance, statistical credibility, and cost-effectiveness. Strategies based on stranding networks rank highly in cost-effectiveness, but their ecological significance and statistical credibility are disputed. Our present goal is to improve the value of stranding data as population indicator as part of monitoring strategies by constructing the spatial and temporal null hypothesis for strandings. The null hypothesis is defined as: small cetacean distribution and mortality are uniform in space and constant in time. We used a drift model to map stranding probabilities and predict stranding patterns of cetacean carcasses under H0 across the North Sea, the Channel and the Bay of Biscay, for the period 1990-2009. As the most common cetacean occurring in this area, we chose the harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena for our modelling. The difference between these strandings expected under H0 and observed strandings is defined as the stranding anomaly. It constituted the stranding data series corrected for drift conditions. Seasonal decomposition of stranding anomaly suggested that drift conditions did not explain observed seasonal variations of porpoise strandings. Long-term stranding anomalies increased first in the southern North Sea, the Channel and Bay of Biscay coasts, and finally the eastern North Sea. The hypothesis of changes in porpoise distribution was consistent with local visual surveys, mostly SCANS surveys (1994 and 2005). This new indicator could be applied to cetacean populations across the world and more widely to marine megafauna."

The halophilic and highly halotolerant bacterium Chromohalobacter salexigens is able to grow up to 3 m NaCl in a minimal medium due to the de novo synthesis of ectoines.

Conclusion: Evolution optimized the metabolism of C. salexigens to support high production of ectoines. Significance: Metabolic adaptations in a compatible solute-accumulating halophile are described for the first time. Halophilic microorganisms demand relatively high salt concentrations to grow. Because of the diversity of environments where they can thrive, their physiology is widely varied. The metabolic diversity of halophilic and halotolerant microorganisms is conditioned by the adaptation to specific environmental niches (especially evident in the case of alkalophilic, methanotrophic, or thermophilic halophilic bacteria) and also by osmoadaptation mechanisms that these microorganisms developed to cope with salinity (1Cayol J.L. Ducerf S. Patel B.K. Garcia J.L. Thomas P. Ollivier B. Thermohalobacter berrensis gen. nov., sp. nov., a thermophilic, strictly halophilic bacterium from a solar saltern.Int. J. Syst. Evol.

The biology and osmoadaptation of haloalkaliphilic methanotrophs.Mikrobiologia. 2002; 71: 149-159PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the preferred metabolic pathways used to assimilate carbon sources are also diverse. Strategies of osmoadaptation can be roughly classified in two main types. The “salt-in” strategy, which consists of the accumulation of K+ and Cl− in the cytoplasm of the cells, is used by extremely halophilic aerobic archaea, halophilic fermentative bacteria, and the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber (4Oren A. Bioenergetic aspects of halophilism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 334-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Oren A. Heldal M. Norland S. Galinski E.A.

Osmoadaptation and osmoregulation in archaea: update 2004.Front. Biosci. 2004; 9: 1999-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The “organic solutes-in” strategy, which involves the accumulation of organic “compatible” solutes, is used by a larger variety of organisms, including all mesophilic bacteria, halophilic algae, halophilic methanogenic archaea, and halotolerant and halophilic aerobic bacteria (7Severin J. Wohlfarth A. Galinslki E.A. The predominant role of recently discovered tetrahydropyrimidines for the osmoadaptation of halophilic eubacteria.J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 1629-1638Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Among the halophilic eubacteria that use the organic solutes-in strategy, strict aerobiosis is more frequent because compatible solute synthesis is energetically and metabolically a very demanding process (4Oren A. Bioenergetic aspects of halophilism.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 334-348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compatible solutes belong to a few chemical families: sugars (sucrose and trehalose), polyols (glycerol, glucosylglycerol, mannosylglycerol, and arabitol, among others), amino acids (glutamine and derivatives, proline, alanine), quaternary amines (betaines and choline), and ectoines (ectoine and β-hydroxyectoine). Ectoine is one of the most widely distributed compatible solutes. Hydroxyectoine is often synthesized at lower amounts together with ectoine by many ectoine-producing species (8Pastor J.M. Salvador M. Argandoña M. Bernal V. Reina-Bueno M. Csonka L.N. Iborra J.L. Vargas C. Nieto J.J. Cánovas M. Ectoines in cell stress protection: uses and biotechnological production.Biotechnol. Adv. 2010; 28: 782-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). When present in the medium, either these compounds or their precursors can be taken up from the environment. When cells are growing in media lacking compatible solutes, these compounds can only be accumulated by de novo synthesis (9Vargas C. Argandoña M. Reina-Bueno M. Rodríguez-Moya J. Fernández-Aunión C.

During active growth, metabolite fluxes are substantially directed toward biosynthetic pathways, draining intermediaries of central metabolism. Therefore, the perfect coupling and efficiency of the metabolic pathways linking carbon sources to the end products (in our case, compatible solutes) is crucial. There are two major pathways for the catabolism of sugars to pyruvate: glycolysis (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) (EM) 8The abbreviations used are: EM, Embden-Meyerhof; ED, Entner-Doudoroff; OAA, oxaloacetate; Gdh, glutamate dehydrogenase; Pc, pyruvate carboxylase; Ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Icdh, isocitrate dehydrogenase; Cs, citrate synthase; Pfk, 6-phosphofructokinase; Gdh, glutamate dehydrogenase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pdh, pyruvate dehydrogenase. and the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway (17Werner S.

The synthesis of ectoines consumes acetyl-CoA, which is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, and oxaloacetate (OAA), which is an intermediate in the TCA cycle and has to be replenished by anaplerotic pathways (16Copeland A. O'Connor K. Lucas S. Lapidus A. Berry K.W. Detter J.C. Del Rio T.G. Hammon N. Dalin E. Tice H. Pitluck S. Bruce D. Goodwin L. Han C. Tapia R. Saunders E. Schmutz J. Brettin T. Larimer F. Land M.

The flux ratios between anaplerotic and catabolic pathways are highly relevant for metabolic adaptation. Metabolic studies in halophilic and halotolerant bacteria are scarce, especially if a focus on the biosynthesis of compatible solutes is sought. In this work, we gained new insights into the role of central metabolism in the osmoadaptation of C. salexigens. Using isotope label tracing, we analyzed the pathways for glucose catabolism and how central metabolism copes with the high metabolic burden caused by ectoines biosynthesis. Our results show how the adaptations developed by this bacterium affect metabolic efficiency at different salinities and represent a step further in the understanding of the physiology of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria. C. salexigens CHR61, a rifampicin-resistant spontaneous mutant of C. salexigens DSM 3043T, was used throughout this study. For ectoine production and for characterization of metabolic pathways, the strain was grown in minimal medium M63 (pH 7.2) containing 16.3 g/liter KH2PO4, 4.2 g/liter KOH, 2 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 39.5 mg/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 mg/liter FeSO4·7H2O. M63 was supplemented with 35.0, 43.8, 146.0, or 175.2 g/liter NaCl (corresponding to 0.6, 0.75, 2.5, or 3 m). As a carbon source, 20 mm glucose was used. Aerobic 100-ml batch cultures were grown in 0.5-liter flasks at 37 °C on a rotary shaker at 210 rpm. Cultures were started from frozen 20% glycerol stocks. Precultures were grown in SW-2 medium (containing 2% (w/v), or 0.3 m, total salts) composed of 15.6 g/liter NaCl, 4.07 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 2.6 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O, 0.4 g/liter KCl, 67 mg/liter CaCl2·2H2O, 47 mg/liter NaBr, and 13 mg/liter NaHCO3 (20Vargas C.

M63 cultures were inoculated to an initial absorbance (A600) of 0.025 with an exponential phase preculture grown overnight in SW-2 medium. Glycerol stocks, solid culture media, and precultures were supplemented with rifampicin to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml. To measure cell concentration, cells were resuspended in a NaCl solution (0.6 to 3.0 m), and absorbance was measured at 600 nm (Novaspec Plus Visible Spectrophotometer, Amersham Biosciences). A600 and gram of dry cell weight (gDCW) were correlated for the strain used, according to the following empirical equations: gDCW/liter = 0.597·A600 (for 0.6 m grown cultures), gDCW/liter = 0.557·A600 (for 0.75 m grown cultures), and gDCW/liter = 0.532·A600 (for 2.5 and 3 m grown cultures). Extracellular organic acids were determined by ion exchange chromatography. Acetate was analyzed in a Shimadzu LC-10 HPLC instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD), equipped with differential refractive index and diode array (UV) detectors (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD). A cation exchange HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad) was used for the separation of organic acids. The mobile phase was 5 mm H2SO4 at a 0.5 ml·min−1 flow rate and 45 °C. Gluconate (m/z 195), pyruvate (m/z 87), lactate (m/z 89), and citrate (m/z 191) were measured using HPLC-MS. Analysis was performed with an Agilent 1200 series HPLC instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to an Agilent 6120 single quadrupole mass spectrometer with orthogonal electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative electrospray ionization mode, using the SCAN mode at a range of m/z 50–300, whereas the selected ion monitoring mode was used for the m/z of each compound. The ion spray voltage was set at 3500 V. Nitrogen with a flux of 12 liters/min was used as the sheath gas (40 p.s.i.) and the auxiliary gas. The ion transfer capillary was heated to 350 °C. The fragmentation voltage was set at 70 V. Separation was carried out on an injection volume of 10 μl using the same column and conditions as the previous method, substituting 5 mm H2SO4 with 0.1% formic acid. Data were acquired by a PC using the Agilent Chemstation software. For the labeling experiments, cells were grown in 100 ml of M63 medium in the presence of isotopically labeled glucose (CortecNet, Voisins-Le Bretonneux, France). Isotopically labeled substrates used were 100% [1-13C]-, [2-13C]-, [6-13C]glucose, or 20% [U-13C6]glucose. Cultures were harvested in the mid to late exponential phase (A600 1.5 to 3), and cells were separated from supernatants by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were concentrated by lyophilization, redissolved in 1 ml of deuterated methanol (Sigma) and used for the identification of extracellular by-products. 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were recorded on a Brucker AV200 spectrometer at 200 MHz and 25 °C, with a relaxation time of 1.5 s. Signals for pyruvate, gluconate, and acetate were assigned by comparison with previously published chemical shifts (Spectral Database for Organic Compounds) and confirmed by comparison with 13C NMR spectra of pure compounds. Compatible solutes (ectoines, glutamate, and trehalose) and membrane lipids were extracted from the cell pellets by a variation of the protocol described by García-Estepa et al. (12García-Estepa R. Argandoña M. Reina-Bueno M. Capote N. Iglesias-Guerra F. Nieto J.J. Vargas C.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3774-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was used for the analysis of compatible solutes, and the chloroform phase for membrane lipids. Spectra were recorded at 25 °C using Brucker AV400 and Brucker AV600 spectrometers at 400 and 600 MHz, respectively, and a relaxation time of 3 s. Peak areas were integrated for relative quantification. Glucose was assayed by a glucose (hexokinase) assay kit (GAHK20, Sigma). Ammonium was assayed by an enzymatic assay kit (11112732035, from R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany). Kits were used according to the recommendations of the manufacturers.

Measurements were carried out in a 96-well microplate reader Synergy HT (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). A unit of enzyme activity was defined as micromoles of substrate consumed or product formed per min and was normalized to milligrams of protein (units·mg−1). In each case, reactor bulk samples were withdrawn, and cells were centrifuged (16,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 65 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Cells were sonicated on ice with a 3-mm diameter probe using a Vibra Cell VC 375 ultrasonic processor (Sonics Materials, Danbury, CT) and centrifuged (16,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C). The supernatant (cell-free extract) was used for subsequent activity measurements.

The CS shell can associate the antigen on its surface, whereas the oily core might provide additional immunostimulating properties. In this first characterization of the system, we intended to study the influence of different antigen organizations on the nanocarrier's surface (using the recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen –rHBsAg– as a model antigen) on their long-term immunopotentiating effect, without any additional immunostimulant. Thus, two prototypes of antigen-loaded CSNC (CSNC+ and CSNC−), exhibiting similar particle size (200 nm) and high antigen association efficiency (>80%), were developed with different surface composition (polymer/antigen ratios) and surface charge (positive/negative, respectively). The biological evaluation of these nanovaccines evidenced the superiority of the CSNC+ as compared to CSNC- and alum-rHBsAg in terms of neutralizing antibody responses, following intramuscular vaccination. Moreover, a single dose of CSNC+ led to similar IgG levels to the positive control. The IgG1/IgG2a ratio suggested a mixed Th1/Th2 response elicited by CSNC+, in contrast to the typical Th2-biased response of alum. Finally, CSNC+ could be freeze-dried without altering its physicochemical properties and adjuvant effect in vivo. In conclusion, the evaluation of CSNC+ confirms its interesting features for enhancing, prolonging and modulating the type of immune response against subunit antigens, such as rHBsAg."

Certain antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) can penetrate the CNS, and are therefore often used in neurologically active combined antiretroviral therapy (Neuro-cART) regimens, but their relative activity in the different susceptible CNS cell populations is unknown. Here, we determined the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of CNS-penetrating ARVs in astrocytes and macrophage-lineage cells. Primary human fetal astrocytes (PFA) and the SVG human astrocyte cell line were used as in vitro models for astrocyte infection, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were used as an in vitro model for infection of macrophage-lineage cells. The CNS-penetrating ARVs tested were the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) abacavir (ABC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T) and zidovudine (ZDV), the non-NRTIs efavirenz (EFV), etravirine (ETR) and nevirapine (NVP), and the integrase inhibitor raltegravir (RAL). Drug inhibition assays were performed using single-round HIV-1 entry assays with luciferase viruses pseudotyped with HIV-1 YU-2 envelope or vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G). All the ARVs tested could effectively inhibit HIV-1 infection in macrophages, with EC90s below concentrations known to be achievable in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Most of the ARVs had similar potency in astrocytes, however the NRTIs 3TC, d4T and ZDV had insufficient HIV-1 inhibitory activity in astrocytes, with EC90s 12-, 187- and 110-fold greater than achievable CSF concentrations, respectively. Our data suggest that 3TC, d4T and ZDV may not adequately target astrocyte infection in vivo, which has potential implications for their inclusion in Neuro-cART regimens."
https://openalex.org/W2133290549,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Radiotherapy is often applied for treating lung cancer, but it often fails because of the relative non-susceptibility of lung cancer cells to radiation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to modulate the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells and have the potential to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to identify a miRNA that can adjust radiosensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma cells. Two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (CL1-0 and CL1-5) with different metastatic ability and radiosensitivity were used. In order to understand the regulatory mechanisms of differential radiosensitivity in these isogenic tumor cells, both CL1-0 and CL1-5 were treated with 10 Gy radiation, and were harvested respectively at 0, 1, 4, and 24 h after radiation exposure. The changes in expression of miRNA upon irradiation were examined using Illumina Human microRNA BeadChips. Twenty-six miRNAs were identified as having differential expression post-irradiation in CL1-0 or CL1-5 cells. Among these miRNAs, miR-449a, which was down-regulated in CL1-0 cells at 24 h after irradiation, was chosen for further investigation. Overexpression of miR-449a in CL1-0 cells effectively increased irradiation-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, altered the cell cycle distribution and eventually led to sensitization of CL1-0 to irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2322419528,"Introduction In humans, cortical mechanisms can interfere with autonomic breathing. Respiratory-related activation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) has been documented during voluntary breathing and in response to inspiratory constraints. The SMA could therefore participate in the increased resting state of the respiratory motor system during wake (i.e. ""wakefulness drive to breathe""). Methods The SMA was conditioned by continuous theta burst magnetic stimulation (cTBS, inhibitory) and 5 Hz conventional rTMS (5 Hz, excitatory). The ensuing effects were described in terms of the diaphragm motor evoked response (DiMEPs) to single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex. DiMEPs were recorded at baseline, and at 3 time-points (""post1"", ""post2"", ""post3"") up to 15 minutes following conditioning of the SMA. Results cTBS reduced the amplitude of DiMEPs from 327.5±159.8 µV at baseline to 243.3±118.7 µV, 217.8±102.9 µV and 240.6±123.9 µV at post 1, post 2 and post 3, respectively (F = 6.341, p = 0.002). 5 Hz conditioning increased the amplitude of DiMEPs from 184.7±96.5 µV at baseline to 270.7±135.4 µV at post 3 (F = 4.844, p = 0.009). Conclusions The corticospinal pathway to the diaphragm can be modulated in both directions by conditioning the SMA. This suggests that the baseline respiratory activity of the SMA represents an equipoise from which it is possible to move in either direction. The resting corticofugal outflow from the SMA to phrenic motoneurones that this study evidences could putatively contribute to the wakefulness drive to breathe."

Among inorganic cores, the importance of gold NPs (AuNPs) derives from the ability of material scientists to functionalize their surface to control uptake and physiological interactions with cells (4Agasti S.S. Chompoosor A. You C.-C. Ghosh P. Kim C.K. Rotello V.M. Photoregulated release of caged anticancer drugs from gold nanoparticles.J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2008; 130: 14139-14143Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). On the one hand, their biocompatibility and lack of core-based toxicity can be used to design AuNPs that are relatively nontoxic for targeting specific intracellular mechanisms. Conversely, AuNPs can be designed to be highly toxic, e.g. to destroy malignant cells (6Massich M.D. Giljohann D.A. Schmucker A.L. Patel P.C. Mirkin C.A. Cellular response of polyvalent oligonucleotide-gold nanoparticle conjugates.ACS Nano. 2010; 4: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 7Kim C. Agasti Sarit S. Zhu Zhengjiang Isaacs Lyle Rotello Vincent M. Recognition-mediated activation of therapeutic gold nanoparticles inside living cells.Nat. Chem. 2010; 2: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Accordingly, understanding AuNP-cell interactions is critical to furthering their use in medicine. An important potential application that has not been explored so far is the utilization of NPs as tools to understand cellular processes such as calcium regulation, cell proliferation/migration, and cell death that are relevant not only to NP effects, but also to their potential use in therapy. In a previous study, we demonstrated that positively charged AuNPs (+AuNPs) increase cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyto) in a variety of cells, whereas negatively charged particles are largely without effect (8Arvizo R.R. Miranda O.R. Thompson M.A. Pabelick C.M. Bhattacharya R. Robertson J.D. Rotello V.M. Prakash Y.S. Mukherjee P. Effect of nanoparticle surface charge at the plasma membrane and beyond.Nano Lett. 2010; 10: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). An interesting observation was that +AuNPs cause substantial cytotoxicity in normal cells (an obviously undesirable effect), yet malignant cells (e.g. ovarian cancer) are highly resistant to +AuNPs despite substantially increased [Ca2+]cyto levels induced by +AuNPs. This raises the intriguing question as to why malignant cells are resistant to +AuNP-induced cytotoxicity, and conversely provides the opportunity to utilize +AuNPs as a tool to uncover the underlying mechanisms of such resistance. In the present study, we hypothesized that mitochondria, via buffering of [Ca2+]cyto, render resistance to +AuNP-induced cytotoxicity in malignant cells (Scheme 1). Beyond their well known role as the energy source within cells, mitochondria are involved in [Ca2+]cyto buffering and regulation of programmed apoptotic cell death (9Ni Chonghaile T. Sarosiek K.A.

Mitochondria and cell signalling.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 807-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although mitochondria express a number of ion transporters capable of Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria, the predominant mechanism is the Ca2+ uniporter, whose identity (MICU1) has been only recently reported (11De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Teardo E. Szabò I. Rizzuto R.

Furthermore, the role of the uniporter regulator MICU1 beyond Ca2+ uptake per se has not yet been established. Release of mitochondrial Ca2+ ([Ca2+]mito) back into the cytosol occurs through Na+/H+-dependent Ca2+ exchange or mitochondrial permeability transition pore (13Kilbride S.M. Prehn J.H.M. Central roles of apoptotic proteins in mitochondrial function.Oncogene. 2012; (August, 6, 10.1038/onc.2012.348)PubMed Google Scholar, 14Whelan R.S. Konstantinidis K. Wei A.-C. Chen Y. Reyna D.E.

Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6566-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Thus, alterations in the expression or function of mitochondrial Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms can have profound cellular effects. Here, the link between high levels of [Ca2+]mito and apoptosis are well established, and there is increasing recognition that mitochondria can regulate the behavior of cancer cells (15Bianchi K. Rimessi A. Prandini A. Szabadkai G. Rizzuto R. Calcium and mitochondria: mechanisms and functions of a troubled relationship.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, the molecular machineries regulating such processes are poorly understood. It has been theorized that the apoptotic resistance of cancer cells is related to distinct properties of their mitochondria as compared with nonmalignant cells (16Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Tumor cell metabolism: Cancer's Achilles' heel.Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 472-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). One of these properties is stabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane against permeabilization, a key event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (14Whelan R.S. Konstantinidis K. Wei A.-C.

Bax regulates primary necrosis through mitochondrial dynamics.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 6566-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, induction of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is dependent on Ca2+ (17Deniaud A. Sharaf el dein O. Maillier E. Poncet D. Kroemer G. Lemaire C. Brenner C. Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces calcium-dependent permeability transition, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and apoptosis.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and the proapoptotic protein Bax (18Youle R.J.

Thus, the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering in modulating cell death cannot be underestimated, making it critical to understand how and why mitochondrial function differs in cancer cells and whether this can explain the resistance of malignant cells to +AuNP-induced cytotoxicity.

Then, dichloromethane was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the oily residue was dissolved in a small amount of distilled water. Dialysis was performed during 5 days (membrane molecular weight cut-off = 10,000) to remove excess ligand and salts remaining in the nanoparticle solution. After dialysis, the particles were lyophilized, redissolved in deionized water, and diluted in buffer to the necessary concentrations. Human ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR5, OV167, and OV202 were grown in DMEM, A2780 was grown in RPMI, and SKOV3-ip was grown in McCoy's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics, and cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere consisting of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) cells were grown in MCDB105 (Sigma, M6395)/Medium 199 (Sigma, M5017) supplemented with 15% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Ovarian cancer cells were plated in 60-mm dishes with 3 ml of their respective cell culture medium. Cells were transfected with 20 μl of 20 μm siRNA (see results for siRNA targets) purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) along with 40 μl of HiPerfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 500 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Scrambled siRNA (Abcam) was used as a control. After 48 h, cells were collected to detect siRNA knockdown efficiency using RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cells using an RNA mini kit (Qiagen: 74104). Quantitative PCR primer assay for MICU1 (Qiagen: PPR50304A) was carried out using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems: 4309155). The comparative Ct method was used to calculate the relative abundance of RNA in various cell lines and compared with that with β-actin expression (-fold difference relative to OSE cells). MICU1 and β-actin primers were from Qiagen (PPH09688A and PPH0073G, respectively). The primer sequence for MT-ND1 (gene for mitochondrial Complex I) is as follows: forward, GGCTATATACAACTACGCAAAGGC, and reverse, GGTAGATGTGGCGGGTTTTAGG. MT-ND1 was used to evaluate mitochondrial copy number. Cells transfected with siRNA were seeded (2 × 104) in 24-well plates and cultured overnight under standard conditions. Following treatment, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added; 4 h later, the cells were washed with chilled PBS, fixed with 100% cold methanol, and collected for measurement of TCA-precipitable radioactivity (23Mukherjee P. Bhattacharya R. Wang P. Wang L. Basu S. Nagy J.A. Atala A. Mukhopadhyay D. Soker S. Antiangiogenic properties of gold nanoparticles.Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 3530-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least three separate times, with each repeat performed in triplicate. Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (1Arvizo R.R. Rana S. Miranda O.R. Bhattacharya R. Rotello V.M. Mukherjee P. Mechanism of anti-angiogenic property of gold nanoparticles: role of nanoparticle size and surface charge.Nanomedicine. 2011; 7: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (catalogue number 500-0006). Cell lysates (20 μg) were electrophoresed through 4–15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were probed with the appropriate antibodies, and bound antibody was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). Primary antibody dilution was 1:500 for ERK1/2 (phospho and total) and 1:250 for Bcl2, Bax, and cytochrome c. The dilution factor for α-tubulin was 1:5,000. Phospho-PERK and total PERK, BiP, IRE1, and protein disulfide isomerase were diluted 1:1,000. Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution. A2780 cells were plated at 5,000 cells/well of a four-chamber slide (Labtek) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics and allowed to rest overnight. Subsequently, two wells were treated with Ru360, and 1 h after treatment, +AuNPs were added to one of the Ru360 wells (Ru360/+AuNP) and to an untreated well (+AuNP) overnight. After treatment, samples were acid-stripped on ice for 1 min with stripping buffer (14.6 g of NaCl, 2.5 ml of acetic acid in 500 ml of H2O) to remove surface-bound nanoparticles. The cells were stained for 10 min with either JC1 (mitochondrial membrane potential; ΔΨm) or MitoTracker Green (mitochondrial tracker) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Separately, TUNEL stains were performed in fixed cells. Nuclei were labeled using DAPI. Samples were then mounted with VECTASHIELD and imaged using an LSM780 confocal microscope, and images were processed using the National Institutes of Health ImageJ software (24Bhattacharyya S. Bhattacharya R. Curley S. McNiven M.A. Mukherjee P. Nanoconjugation modulates the trafficking and mechanism of antibody induced receptor endocytosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For TUNEL analysis, the number of healthy cells and the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted and totaled. Cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes at 3 × 105. At ∼80% confluence, Scr siRNA and MICU siRNA cells were treated with +AuNPs overnight (medium alone for control cells). After treatment, cells were thoroughly rinsed with 1× PBS. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining flow cytometry was performed according to manufacturer-provided protocol. A2780 cells were seeded 1 × 106 in 10-cm dishes and allowed to grow overnight under standard conditions. Plates were treated overnight (16 h) with Ru360 only, +AuNPs only, or with both Ru360 and +AuNPs. The assay was carried out following the manufacturer's protocol, and was read at 405 nm. Treated cells were compared with nontreated cells (noninduced). The assay was repeated in triplicate on different days. Real-time fluorescence imaging of different parameters was performed using a Molecular Devices FlexStation 3 microplate reader with micropipetting capabilities. 1 × 104 A2780 cells were seeded onto a 96-well clear bottom plate (CoStar catalogue number 3603) and allowed to grow overnight in standard conditions. Plates were rinsed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and subsequently loaded with one of the following: 2 μm DisBAC2(3) (cell-permeant plasma membrane potential-sensitive dye; excitation 488/emission 530), 2 μm JC-1 (cell-permeant mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) dye; excitation 488/emission 590), 5 μm mag-Fluo-4 (ER Ca2+ [Ca2+]ER-sensitive dye; excitation 495/emission 525), 5 μm fura-2 ([Ca2+]cyto-sensitive dye; excitation 340 or 380/emission 510); or 5 μm rhod-2 ([Ca2+]mito-sensitive dye; excitation 568/emission 590). For plasma membrane potential and ΔΨm, calibration was performed in situ by exposing a subset of cells to a range of KCl concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 mm KCl in Hanks' balanced salt solution). [Ca2+]ER and [Ca2+]mito calibrations were performed as described previously (25Delmotte P. Yang B. Thompson M.A. Pabelick C.M. Prakash Y.S. Sieck G.C. Inflammation alters regional mitochondrial Ca2+ in human airway smooth muscle cells.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2012; 303: C244-C256Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All values are expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using two-sided Student's t test. To determine whether the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter contributes to cellular responses to AuNPs, we initially examined MICU1 mRNA expression in various ovarian cancer cells, comparing them with normal OSE, and found both A2780 and OV202 to have more than ∼3-fold higher MICU1 expression (Fig. 1A). Such high expression of MICU1 could be due to increased number of total mitochondria, a prominent feature of malignancy (26Fulda S. Galluzzi L. Kroemer G. Targeting mitochondria for cancer therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 447-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 27Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Mitochondria in cancer cells: what is so special about them?.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 165-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells undergoing malignant transformations often increase and include ion channels, especially those that transport Ca2+ (28Prevarskaya N. Skryma R. Shuba Y. Ion channels and the hallmarks of cancer.Trends Mol. Med. 2010; 16: 107-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); however, it is unknown whether mitochondrial ion channels are similarly up-regulated. We determined the mitochondrial copy number in OSE and in different ovarian cancer cells using RT-PCR for the Complex I gene MT-ND1 (Fig. 1B). It was evident that mitochondrial copy numbers in ovarian cancer cells relative to OSE were generally higher. This is further demonstrated in Fig. 1C showing more than a 2-fold increase in green fluorescence (via MitoTracker) in A2780 cells as compared with OSE, indicative of an increased number of mitochondria in malignant cells as compared with nonmalignant cells. However, most relevant to this study, normalization of MICU1 expression to mitochondrial copy number demonstrated comparable expression of MICU1 per mitochondrion in malignant ovarian cells relative to OSE (nonmalignant cells; Fig. 1D). The functional significance of the increased number of mitochondria in malignant cells may then be that the net greater total amount of MICU1 allows for greater mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering. We tested this in A2780 cells loaded with the fluorescent [Ca2+]cyto and [Ca2+]mito indicators fura-2/AM and rhod-2/AM, respectively. Exposure of A2780 cells to 1 μm +AuNPs resulted in rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyto (as we observed previously (8Arvizo R.R. Miranda O.R. Thompson M.A. Pabelick C.M. Bhattacharya R. Robertson J.D. Rotello V.M. Prakash Y.S. Mukherjee P. Effect of nanoparticle surface charge at the plasma membrane and beyond.Nano Lett. 2010; 10: 2543-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), Fig. 2 A) as well as a slow sustained increase in [Ca2+]mito (Fig. 2B), the latter suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, rather than the more rapid Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. As compared with A2780, +AuNPs caused smaller [Ca2+]cyto and [Ca2+]mito responses in nonmalignant OSE cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Pretreatment with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake inhibitor Ru360 entirely abrogated the [Ca2+]mito response to +AuNPs, especially in A2780 cells (Fig. 2B). siRNA-mediated knockdown (MICU siRNA) had effects comparable with Ru360, whereas scrambled siRNA (Scr siRNA) was without effect (i.e. +AuNPs increased [Ca2+]mito; Fig. 2B). However, the converse effect of inhibited mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was a substantial increase in [Ca2+]cyto in the presence of Ru360 or MICU siRNA (Fig. 2A). These differences of responses were further validated in other ovarian cancer cell lines. When normalized to OSE (nonmalignant cell line), SKOV3-ip and OV202 had a comparable response to +AuNPs and MICU inhibition analogous to A2780 (Fig. 2, E and F). This difference in amplitude (relative to OSE) demonstrates how mitochondrial buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ correlates to MICU1 expression (Fig. 1). It is also evident from Figs. 1B and 2, E and F, that when normalized with respect to mitochondrial copy number, the ability of MICU1 to regulate buffering of cytosolic calcium is higher in malignant cells as compared with normal OSE cells. Specifically, these data highlight the functional importance of MICU1 in the mitochondrial response of malignant cells, showing that increase in MICU1 expression translated to enhanced ability to buffer increases in [Ca2+]cyto induced by +AuNPs.FIGURE 2.MICU1-mediated calcium buffering in ovarian cancer cells evaluated using +AuNPs. A and B, in A2780 cells loaded with the fluorescent dyes fura-2 ([Ca2+]cyto) and rhod-2 ([Ca2+]mito), 1 μm +AuNPs caused rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyto (A) but slower sustained increases in [Ca2+]mito (B). Inhibition of uniporter using Ru360 or MICU1 siRNA abrogated [Ca2+]mito responses to +AuNPs, and conversely enhanced [Ca2+]cyto responses. C and D, in contrast to A2780, [Ca2+]cyto and especially [Ca2+]mito responses, or the effects of uniporter inhibition, were substantially smaller in nonmalignant OSE cells. NT, nontreated controls. E and F, the greater role of uniporter in [Ca2+]cyto (E) buffering and [Ca2+]mito (F) responses to +AuNPs is valid in different types of ovarian cancer cells (A2780, OV202, and SKOV3-ip), highlighting the functional importance of MICU1 in malignant cells. Values are means ± S.D., n = 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Given its only recent recognition, beyond mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, the functions of MICU1 are currently unknown. In A2780 cells loaded with the plasma membrane potential indicator DisBAC2(3), we found that +AuNPs produce substantial membrane depolarization (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, inhibition of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter with Ru360, or MICU siRNA resulted in substantial enhancement of +AuNP-induced membrane depolarization. However, in OSE cells, +AuNPs induced hyperpolarization, which was further enhanced in the presence of Ru360 (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in A2780 cells loaded with the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) indicator JC-1, +AuNPs also produced mitochondrial depolarization to some extent, but Ru360 as well as MICU siRNA substantially enhanced such depolarization. ΔΨm is the driving force behind the influx of ions (H+, Ca2+) into mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3C, upon depolarization, the punctate orange-red fluorescent JC1 staining was replaced by diffuse green monomer fluorescence, whereas no change was seen in OSE cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3D). Although a slight decrease in ΔΨm occurred in cells treated with Ru360 only or +AuNPs only, in the presence of both Ru360 and +AuNPs, there was substantial change in ΔΨm in A2780 cells (Fig. 3, C and E), but only a slight change in OSE cells (Fig. 3, D and F). These data suggest that inhibiting MICU1 allows +AuNPs to induce a robust mitochondrial membrane depolarization in malignant ovarian cells, substantially larger than in normal OSE. These differences may have downstream effects of sensitizing malignant cells to the antiproliferative and/or proapoptotic effects of +AuNPs. In our previous work, we had observed that unlike nonmalignant human bronchial epithelial cells and airway smooth muscle cells, cancer cells are able to tolerate the substantial increases in [Ca2+]cyto induced by +AuNPs without changes in cell"
https://openalex.org/W2046000835,"Aphids commonly harbor bacterial facultative symbionts that have a variety of effects upon their aphid hosts, including defense against hymenopteran parasitoids and fungal pathogens. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is infected with the symbiont Arsenophonus sp., which has an unknown role in its aphid host. Our research goals were to document the infection frequency and diversity of the symbiont in field-collected soybean aphids, and to determine whether Arsenophonus is defending soybean aphid against natural enemies. We performed diagnostic PCR and sequenced four Arsenophonus genes in soybean aphids from their native and introduced range to estimate infection frequency and genetic diversity, and found that Arsenophonus infection is highly prevalent and genetically uniform. To evaluate the defensive role of Arsenophonus, we cured two aphid genotypes of their natural Arsenophonus infection through ampicillin microinjection, resulting in infected and uninfected isolines within the same genetic background. These isolines were subjected to parasitoid assays using a recently introduced biological control agent, Binodoxys communis [Braconidae], a naturally recruited parasitoid, Aphelinus certus [Aphelinidae], and a commercially available biological control agent, Aphidius colemani [Braconidae]. We also assayed the effect of the common aphid fungal pathogen, Pandora neoaphidis (Remaudiere & Hennebert) Humber (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae), on the same aphid isolines. We did not find differences in successful parasitism for any of the parasitoid species, nor did we find differences in P. neoaphidis infection between our treatments. Our conclusion is that Arsenophonus does not defend its soybean aphid host against these major parasitoid and fungal natural enemies."
https://openalex.org/W2077355876,"Selenoprotein S (SelS) is a 189 amino acid trans-membrane protein that plays an important yet undefined role in the unfolded protein response. It has been proposed that SelS may function as a reductase, with the penultimate selenocysteine (Sec(188)) residue participating in a selenosulfide bond with cysteine (Cys(174)). Cotranslational incorporation of Sec into SelS depends on the recoding of the UGA codon, which requires a Selenocysteine Insertion Sequence (SECIS) element in the 3'UTR of the transcript. Here we identify multiple mechanisms that regulate the expression of SelS. The human SelS gene encodes two transcripts (variants 1 and 2), which differ in their 3'UTR sequences due to an alternative splicing event that removes the SECIS element from the variant 1 transcript. Both transcripts are widely expressed in human cell lines, with the SECIS-containing variant 2 mRNA being more abundant. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the variant 1 3'UTR does not allow readthrough of the UGA/Sec codon. Thus, this transcript would produce a truncated protein that does not contain Sec and cannot make the selenosulfide bond. While the variant 2 3'UTR does support Sec insertion, its activity is weak. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two highly conserved stem-loop structures, one in the proximal part of the variant 2 3'UTR and the other immediately downstream of the SECIS element. The proximal stem-loop promotes Sec insertion in the native context but not when positioned far from the UGA/Sec codon in a heterologous mRNA. In contrast, the 140 nucleotides downstream of the SECIS element inhibit Sec insertion. We also show that endogenous SelS is enriched at perinuclear speckles, in addition to its known localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results suggest the expression of endogenous SelS is more complex than previously appreciated, which has implications for past and future studies on the function of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2075109404,"Background Head and neck cancer (HNC) is associated with a high rate of developing second primary malignancies(SPMs). But the impact on survival remains poorly understood before. Therefore, we want to estimate the impact of SPMs on HNC survivors. Methods and Findings Between 1986 and 2008, a total of 9,996 SPMs were recorded for 93,891 patients with an initial diagnosis of HNC by the Taiwan Cancer Registry. Patients were followed with national death registry database to 2011.Using the Kaplan–Meier method, a time-dependent covariate was employed to compare the survival rates between patients with and without SPMs. A Cox proportional hazards model that treated age and sex as confounders was used to examine the hazard ratios of SPMs. The relative survival rates were calculated using age- and sex-specific life tables for the population. Parametric mixture cure fraction models were then employed to estimate the percentage of cancer survivors who would be cured. Use of the Kaplan–Meier method showed that the crude survival rates differed significantly for patients with and patients without SPMs (log-rank test <0.01). For the results of Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, SPMs had a significant influence on survival rates with univariate (HR 2.59,95% CI 2.53to 2.65) and multivariate analysis (HR 2.34, 2.28 to 2.40). Patients with SPMs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) had the highest cure rate at 39%, where as esophageal and lung cancer had the worst prognosis, with a cure rate of 11%. Conclusions A worse prognosis was found for second primary cancer such as esophageal or lung cancer. Patients and healthcare providers must strongly consider and have a high clinical suspicion of these SPMs."
https://openalex.org/W2086376250,"The genetic mechanisms governing human pre-implantation embryo development and the in vitro counterparts, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), still remain incomplete. Previous global genome studies demonstrated that totipotent blastomeres from day-3 human embryos and pluripotent inner cell masses (ICMs) from blastocysts, display unique and differing transcriptomes. Nevertheless, comparative gene expression analysis has revealed that no significant differences exist between hESCs derived from blastomeres versus those obtained from ICMs, suggesting that pluripotent hESCs involve a new developmental progression. To understand early human stages evolution, we developed an undifferentiation network signature (UNS) and applied it to a differential gene expression profile between single blastomeres from day-3 embryos, ICMs and hESCs. This allowed us to establish a unique signature composed of highly interconnected genes characteristic of totipotency (61 genes), in vivo pluripotency (20 genes), and in vitro pluripotency (107 genes), and which are also proprietary according to functional analysis. This systems biology approach has led to an improved understanding of the molecular and signaling processes governing human pre-implantation embryo development, as well as enabling us to comprehend how hESCs might adapt to in vitro culture conditions."

The spectral sensitivities of the V, O, R and dR receptors did not match the predicted spectra of any visual pigments, but with the filtering effects of the pigments around the rhabdom, they can be reasonably explained. In some of the receptors, negative-going responses were observed when they were stimulated at certain wavelengths, indicating antagonistic interactions between photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2057600896,"Since its introduction to the market in the 1970s, the synthetic biocide triclosan has had widespread use in household and medical products. Although decreased triclosan susceptibility has been observed for several bacterial species, when exposed under laboratory settings, no in vivo studies have associated triclosan use with decreased triclosan susceptibility or cross-resistance to antibiotics. One major challenge of such studies is the lack of strains that with certainty have not been exposed to triclosan. Here we have overcome this challenge by comparing current isolates of the human opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis with isolates collected in the 1960s prior to introduction of triclosan to the market. Of 64 current S. epidermidis isolates 12.5% were found to have tolerance towards triclosan defined as MIC≥0.25 mg/l compared to none of 34 isolates obtained in the 1960s. When passaged in the laboratory in the presence of triclosan, old and current susceptible isolates could be adapted to the same triclosan MIC level as found in current tolerant isolates. DNA sequence analysis revealed that laboratory-adapted strains carried mutations in fabI encoding the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase isoform, FabI, that is the target of triclosan, and the expression of fabI was also increased. However, the majority of the tolerant current isolates carried no mutations in fabI or the putative promoter region. Thus, this study indicates that the widespread use of triclosan has resulted in the occurrence of S. epidermidis with tolerance towards triclosan and that the adaptation involves FabI as well as other factors. We suggest increased caution in the general application of triclosan as triclosan has not shown efficacy in reducing infections and is toxic to aquatic organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2086567174,"Purpose Mistletoe extracts are often used in complementary cancer therapy although the efficacy of that therapy is controversially discussed. Approved mistletoe extracts contain mainly water soluble compounds of the mistletoe plant, i.e. mistletoe lectins. However, mistletoe also contains water-insoluble triterpenoids (mainly oleanolic acid) that have anti-tumorigenic effects. To overcome their loss in watery extracts we have solubilized mistletoe triterpenoids with cyclodextrins, thus making them available for in vivo cancer experiments. Experimental design B16.F10 subcutaneous melanoma bearing C57BL/6 mice were treated with new mistletoe extracts containing both water soluble compounds and solubilized triterpenoids. Tumor growth and survival was monitored. In addition, histological examinations of the tumor material and tumor surrounding tissue were performed. Results Addition of solubilized triterpenoids increased the anti-tumor effects of the mistletoe extracts, resulting in reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Histological examination of the treated tumors showed mainly tumor necrosis and some apoptotic cells with active caspase-3 and TUNEL staining. A significant decrease of CD31-positive tumor blood vessels was observed after treatment with solubilized triterpenoids and different mistletoe extracts. Conclusion We conclude that the addition of solubilized mistletoe triterpenoids to conventional mistletoe extracts improves the efficacy of mistletoe treatment and may represent a novel treatment option for malignant melanoma."

A model of PH induced by drug (monocrotaline, MCT) has been extensively used in mice to examine the etiology of PH. However, it is unclear if PH induced by MCT in mice reproduces the loss of body weight and diaphragm muscle dysfunction seen in patients. This is a pre-requisite for widespread use of mice to examine mechanisms of cachexia and diaphragm abnormalities in PH. Thus, we measured body and soleus muscle weight, food intake, and diaphragm contractile properties in mice after 6–8 weeks of saline (control) or MCT (600 mg/kg) injections. Body weight progressively decreased in PH mice, while food intake was similar in both groups. PH decreased (P<0.05) diaphragm maximal isometric specific force, maximal shortening velocity, and peak power. Protein carbonyls in whole-diaphragm lysates and the abundance of select myofibrillar proteins were unchanged by PH. Our findings show diaphragm isometric and isotonic contractile abnormalities in a murine model of PH induced by MCT. Overall, the murine model of PH elicited by MCT mimics loss of body weight and diaphragm muscle weakness reported in PH patients."
https://openalex.org/W2015475084,"We investigated sex chromosome diversity in Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (Z. rouxii). In the current study, we show that the organization of the mating-type (MAT) locus is highly variable in the Z. rouxii population, indicating the MAT, HML, and HMR loci are translocation hotspots. Although NBRC1130 and CBS732 were originally two stocks of the type strain of the species, only NBRC1130 retains the original karyotype. A reciprocal translocation between the MAT and HMR loci appears to have occurred during the early passage culture of CBS732, which was used for genome sequencing. In NBRC1733, NBRC0686, NBRC0740 and NBRC1053, the terminal region of the chromosome containing the HMR locus was replaced with the chromosomal region to the left of the MAT or HML loci. The translocation events found in NBRC1733, NBRC0686, NBRC0740, and NBRC1053 were reconstructed under our experimental conditions using the DA2 background, and the reconstruction suggests that the frequency of this type of translocation is approximately 10−7. These results suggest that the MAT and MAT-like loci were the susceptible regions in the genome, and the diversity of mating-type chromosome structures in Z. rouxii was caused by ectopic exchanges between MAT-like loci."
https://openalex.org/W2018445940,"Nelfinavir (NLF), an antiretroviral agent, preserves mitochondrial membranes integrity and protects mature brain against ischemic injury in rodents. Our study demonstrates that in neonatal mice NLF significantly limits mitochondrial calcium influx, the event associated with protection of the brain against hypoxic-ischemic insult (HI). Compared to the vehicle-treated mice, cerebral mitochondria from NLF-treated mice exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to the Ca(2+)-induced membrane permeabilization, greater ADP-phosphorylating activity and reduced cytochrome C release during reperfusion. Pre-treatment with NLF or Ruthenium red (RuR) significantly improved viability of murine hippocampal HT-22 cells, reduced Ca(2+) content and preserved membrane potential (Ψm) in mitochondria following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Following histamine-stimulated Ca(2+) release from endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to the vehicle-treated cells, the cells treated with NLF or RuR also demonstrated reduced Ca(2+) content in their mitochondria, the event associated with preserved Ψm. Because RuR inhibits mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter, we tested whether the NLF acts via the mechanism similar to the RuR. However, in contrast to the RuR, in the experiment with direct interaction of these agents with mitochondria isolated from naïve mice, the NLF did not alter mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx, and did not prevent Ca(2+) induced collapse of the Ψm. These data strongly argues against interaction of NLF and mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, our study is the first to show that NLF inhibits intramitochondrial Ca(2+) flux and protects developing brain against HI-reperfusion injury. This novel action of NLF has important clinical implication, because it targets a fundamental mechanism of post-ischemic cell death: intramitochondrial Ca(2+) overload → mitochondrial membrane permeabilization → secondary energy failure."
https://openalex.org/W2088440422,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease. It is thought to be mediated by CD4(+) Th1/Th17 cells. More recently, cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells have been in focus. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is an approved drug for treating MS patients.In the current study we examined the activities of NK and DCs in nine relapsing remitting MS patients for up to one year after initiation of GA treatment. We observed that NK cells isolated from most of these patients have increased cytotoxic activity against K562 cells. Further analysis showed that the same NK cells lysed both autologous immature (i) and mature (m) DCs. In most patients this increased activity was correlated with increased NK cell activating cytotoxicity receptors such as NKp30, NKp44, NKp46 and NKG2D, and reduced expression of the inhibitory molecule CD158 on the surface of these NK cells. The expression of HLA-DR was increased on iDCs and mDCs in the majority of the patients, but no consistency was observed for the expression of HLA-I or HLA-E. Also, the co-stimulatory receptors CD80, CD83 or CD86 expression was down-regulated on iDCs and mDCs in most cases. Further, the expression of CCR6 was increased on mDCs at later time points of therapy (between 32-48 weeks).Our results are the first showing the effects of GA treatment on NK cells in MS patients, which may impact future use of this and other drugs to treat this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2165007673,"The tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system PCR (T-ARMS-PCR) is a fast and economical means of assaying SNP's, requiring only PCR amplification and subsequent electrophoresis for the determination of genotypes. To improve the throughput and efficiency of T-ARMS-PCR, we combined T-ARMS-PCR with a chimeric primer-based temperature switch PCR (TSP) strategy, and used capillary electrophoresis (CE) for amplicon separation and identification. We assessed this process in the simultaneous genotyping of four breast cancer-and two cervical cancer risk-related SNPs.A total of 24 T-ARMS-PCR primers, each 5'-tagged with a universal sequence and a pair of universal primers, were pooled together to amplify the 12 target alleles of 6 SNPs in 186 control female blood samples. Direct sequencing of all samples was also performed to assess the accuracy of this method.Of the 186 samples, as many as 11 amplicons can be produced in one single PCR and separated by CE. Genotyping results of the multiplex T-ARMS-PCR were in complete agreement with direct sequencing of all samples.This novel multiplex T-ARMS-PCR method is the first reported method allowing one to genotype six SNPs in a single reaction with no post-PCR treatment other than electrophoresis. This method is reliable, fast, and easy to perform."
https://openalex.org/W1988313845,"Disturbances in cognitive functioning are among the most debilitating problems experienced by patients with major depression. Investigations of these deficits in animals help to extend and refine our understanding of human emotional disorder, while at the same time providing valid tools to study higher executive functions in animals. We employ the ""learned helplessness"" genetic rat model of depression in studying working memory using an eight arm radial maze procedure with temporal delay. This so-called delayed spatial win-shift task consists of three phases, training, delay and test, requiring rats to hold information on-line across a retention interval and making choices based on this information in the test phase. According to a 2×2 factorial design, working memory performance of thirty-one congenitally helpless (cLH) and non-helpless (cNLH) rats was tested on eighteen trials, additionally imposing two different delay durations, 30 s and 15 min, respectively. While not observing a general cognitive deficit in cLH rats, the delay length greatly influenced maze performance. Notably, performance was most impaired in cLH rats tested with the shorter 30 s delay, suggesting a stress-related disruption of attentional processes in rats that are more sensitive to stress. Our study provides direct animal homologues of clinically important measures in human research, and contributes to the non-invasive assessment of cognitive deficits associated with depression."
https://openalex.org/W2015900537,"The repressor element silencing transcription factor (REST) is a coordinate transcriptional and epigenetic regulator which functions as a tumor suppressor or an oncogene depending on cellular context, and a truncated splice variant REST4 has been linked to various types of cancer. We performed a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing (AS) of REST by rapid amplification of cDNA ends and PCR amplification of cDNAs from various tissues and cell lines with specific primers. We identified 8 novel alternative exons including an alternate last exon which doubles the REST gene boundary, along with numerous 5′/3′ splice sites and ends in the constitutive exons. With the combination of various splicing patterns (e.g. exon skipping and alternative usage of the first and last exons) that are predictive of altered REST activity, at least 45 alternatively spliced variants of coding and non-coding mRNA were expressed in a species- and cell-type/tissue-specific manner with individual differences. By examining the repertoire of REST pre-mRNA splicing in 27 patients with kidney, liver and lung cancer, we found that all patients without exception showed differential expression of various REST splice variants between paired tumor and adjacent normal tissues, with striking cell-type/tissue and individual differences. Moreover, we revealed that exon 3 skipping, which causes no frame shift but loss of a domain essential for nuclear translocation, was affected by pioglitazone, a highly selective activator of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) which contributes to cell differentiation and tumorigenesis besides its metabolic actions. Accordingly, this study demonstrates an extensive AS of REST pre-mRNA which redefines REST gene boundary and structure, along with a general but differential link between REST pre-mRNA splicing and various types of cancer. These findings advance our understanding of the complex, context-dependent regulation of REST gene expression and function, and provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2142232504,"Groups of neurons firing synchronously are hypothesized to underlie many cognitive functions such as attention, associative learning, memory, and sensory selection. Recent theories suggest that transient periods of synchronization and desynchronization provide a mechanism for dynamically integrating and forming coalitions of functionally related neural areas, and that at these times conditions are optimal for information transfer. Oscillating neural populations display a great amount of spectral complexity, with several rhythms temporally coexisting in different structures and interacting with each other. This paper explores inter-band frequency modulation between neural oscillators using models of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. We vary the structural connectivity in a network of neural oscillators, assess the spectral complexity, and correlate the inter-band frequency modulation. We contrast this correlation against measures of metastable coalition entropy and synchrony. Our results show that oscillations in different neural populations modulate each other so as to change frequency, and that the interaction of these fluctuating frequencies in the network as a whole is able to drive different neural populations towards episodes of synchrony. Further to this, we locate an area in the connectivity space in which the system directs itself in this way so as to explore a large repertoire of synchronous coalitions. We suggest that such dynamics facilitate versatile exploration, integration, and communication between functionally related neural areas, and thereby supports sophisticated cognitive processing in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2087512076,"Rho family GTPases are critical regulators of many important cellular processes and the dysregulation of their activities is implicated in a variety of human diseases including oncogenesis and propagation of malignancy. The traditional methods, such as ""pull-down"" or two-hybrid procedures, are poorly suited to dynamically evaluate the activity of Rho GTPases, especially in living mammalian cells. To provide a novel alternative approach to analyzing Rho GTPase-associated signaling pathways in vivo, we developed a series of bioluminescent biosensors based on the genetically engineered firefly luciferase. These split-luciferase-based biosensors enable non-invasive visualization and quantification of the activity of Rho GTPases in living subjects. The strategy is to reasonably split the gene of firefly luciferase protein into two inactive fragments and then respectively fuse the two fragments to Rho GTPase and the GTPase-binding domain (GBD) of the specific effector. Upon Rho GTPase interacting with the binding domain in a GTP-dependent manner, these two luciferase fragments are brought into close proximity, leading to luciferase reconstitution and photon production in the presence of the substrate. Using these bimolecular luminescence complementation (BiLC) biosensors, we successfully visualized and quantified the activities of the three best characterized Rho GTPases by measuring the luminescence in living cells. We also experimentally investigated the sensitivity of these Rho GTPase biosensors to upstream regulatory proteins and extracellular ligands without lysing cells and doing labor-intensive works. By virtue of the unique functional characteristics of bioluminescence imaging, the BiLC-based biosensors provide an enormous potential for in vivo imaging of Rho GTPase signaling pathways and high-throughput screening of therapeutic drugs targeted to Rho GTPases and (or) upstream molecules in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W1992695593,"Adenosine is an inhibitory neuromodulator that exerts antiepileptic effects in the brain and the entorhinal cortex (EC) is an essential structure involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas microinjection of adenosine into the EC has been shown to exert powerful antiepileptic effects, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms in the EC have not been determined yet. We tested the hypothesis that adenosine-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission contributes to its antiepileptic effects in the EC. Our results demonstrate that adenosine reversibly inhibited glutamatergic transmission via activation of adenosine A1 receptors without effects on GABAergic transmission in layer III pyramidal neurons in the EC. Adenosine-induced depression of glutamatergic transmission was mediated by inhibiting presynaptic glutamate release probability and decreasing the number of readily releasable vesicles. Bath application of adenosine also reduced the frequency of the miniature EPSCs recorded in the presence of TTX suggesting that adenosine may interact with the exocytosis processes downstream of Ca2+ influx. Both Gαi/o proteins and the protein kinase A pathway were required for adenosine-induced depression of glutamatergic transmission. We further showed that bath application of picrotoxin to the EC slices induced stable epileptiform activity and bath application of adenosine dose-dependently inhibited the epileptiform activity in this seizure model. Adenosine-mediated depression of epileptiform activity was mediated by activation of adenosine A1 receptors and required the functions of Gαi/o proteins and protein kinase A pathway. Our results suggest that the depression of glutamatergic transmission induced by adenosine contributes to its antiepileptic effects in the EC."
https://openalex.org/W2012555015,"Sorting nexins are phox homology (PX) domain-containing proteins involved in diverse intracellular endosomal trafficking pathways. The PX domain binds to certain phosphatidylinositols and is recruited to vesicles rich in these lipids. The structure of the PX domain is highly conserved, containing a three-stranded β-sheet, followed by three α-helices. Here, we report the crystal structures of truncated human SNX11 (sorting nexin 11). The structures reveal that SNX11 contains a novel PX domain, hereby named the extended PX (PXe) domain, with two additional α-helices at the C terminus. We demonstrate that these α-helices are indispensible for the in vitro functions of SNX11. We propose that this PXe domain is present in SNX10 and is responsible for the vacuolation activity of SNX10. Thus, this novel PXe domain constitutes a structurally and functionally important PX domain subfamily."

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of serum CK level in breast cancer patients.823 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer were consecutively recruited as cases, and 823 age-match patients with benign breast disease were selected as controls. Serum CK was analyzed by commercially available standardized methods.Serum CK level was significantly associated with breast cancer (P = 0.005) and subtypes of breast cancer, including breast cancer with diameter>2 cm (P = 0.031) and stage IIIbreast cancer (P = 0.025). The mean serum CK level in patients with>2 cm tumor was significantly lower than that in≤2 cm (P = 0.0475), and the mean serum CK level of stage III breast cancer patients was significantly lower than that of stage I and II breast cancer patients (P = 0.0246). Furthermore, a significant difference (P = 0.004) was observed between serum CK level and ERBB2+breast cancer not other molecular subtypes.Serum CK levels in cases was significantly lower compared with controls. Notably, our results indicated for the first time that there was a negative correlation between serum CK levels and breast cancer stage. Serum CK level, which may reflect the status of host immunity, may be an important factor in determining breast cancer development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2060199665,"Many zoophilous plants attract their pollinators by offering nectar as a reward. In gynodioecious plants (i.e. populations are composed of female and hermaphrodite individuals) nectar production has been repeatedly reported to be larger in hermaphrodite compared to female flowers even though nectar production across the different floral phases in dichogamous plants (i.e. plants with time separation of pollen dispersal and stigma receptivity) has rarely been examined. In this study, sugar production in nectar standing crop and secretion rate were investigated in Geranium sylvaticum, a gynodioecious plant species with protandry (i.e. with hermaphrodite flowers releasing their pollen before the stigma is receptive). We found that flowers from hermaphrodites produced more nectar than female flowers in terms of total nectar sugar content. In addition, differences in nectar production among floral phases were found in hermaphrodite flowers but not in female flowers. In hermaphrodite flowers, maximum sugar content coincided with pollen presentation and declined slightly towards the female phase, indicating nectar reabsorption, whereas in female flowers sugar content did not differ between the floral phases. These differences in floral reward are discussed in relation to visitation patterns by pollinators and seed production in this species."

Between patients and HLA-B27-negative controls no significant difference in the genotype distribution of the rs703842 A>G polymorphism was found (p = 0.97).Our data suggest that the rs703842 A>G polymorphism may play a role in HLA-B27-associated uveitis."

Significance: Our findings reveal a new mechanism for regulating CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. The CD1 family of antigen-presenting molecules has been studied extensively and with increasing interest over the last several years. These non-polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like proteins are distinguished by their ability to present lipid antigens as opposed to peptides. CD1d, the sole member of the Group 2 CD1 molecules (1De Libero G. Mori L.

The most studied NKT cells (called invariant NKT (iNKT) cells) have T-cell receptors (TCRs) with limited diversity (3Bendelac A. Savage P.B. Teyton L. The biology of NKT cells.Annu. Rev.

This property, along with the ability of CD1d to bind and present a wide variety of lipids, allows for polyclonal activation in response to both exogenous and endogenous lipids. iNKT cells also have a memory-like phenotype and can respond to antigens in a matter of hours without the need for sensitization. This rapid response coupled with the ability to secrete copious amounts of cytokines enables iNKT cells to exert a major influence on ensuing immune responses. iNKT cells have been implicated in protective immunity to a large number of infections (6Tupin E.

Natural killer T cell defects and human disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Similarly, iNKT cells have been implicated in tumor immunity and have potential as mediators of tumor immunotherapy (8Terabe M. Berzofsky J.A. The role of NKT cells in tumor immunity.Adv. Cancer Res. 2008; 101: 277-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). There is significant variation in the nature and amplitude of the iNKT cell response elicited by various CD1d-presented lipids (for review, see Ref. 9Mallevaey T. Selvanantham T. Strategy of lipid recognition by invariant natural killer T cells. “One for all and all for one.”.Immunology. 2012; 136: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There has been great interest in uncovering the basis for these differences, and the mechanisms are manifold. Many reports have focused on the molecular underpinnings of CD1d-lipid-TCR interactions and their effect on NKT cell activation (for review, see Refs. 10Rossjohn J. Pellicci D.G. Patel O. Gapin L.

Structural studies have revealed that CD1d has an MHC-like antigen binding groove with two hydrophobic pockets. CD1d antigens, although varied, are all amphipathic. The hydrophobic portion (usually consisting of two aliphatic carbon chains) is buried in the two hydrophobic channels, and the polar head group (either sugar- or phosphate-based) is solvent-exposed. Because of this orientation, most of the actual contacts at the CD1d-TCR interface are mediated by the lipid head group and the CD1d α1 and α2 chains themselves. However, differences in the buried hydrophobic portions of the lipid clearly affect the function of the CD1d-lipid complex (12McCarthy C. Shepherd D. Fleire S. Stronge V.S. Koch M. Illarionov P.A.

Similar to MHC class I, CD1d consists of a single-pass transmembrane polypeptide (the free heavy chain) complexed to soluble β2-microglobulin (β2m). After synthesis and translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), newly synthesized CD1d heavy chains are stabilized by interaction with the ER lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (CRT) (16Kang S.J. Cresswell P. Calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 cooperate in disulfide bond formation in human CD1d heavy chain.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44838-44844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Chaperone binding recruits ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase that facilitates disulfide bond maturation. In contrast to MHC class I, β2m binding to CD1d occurs after heavy chain dissociation from the lectin chaperones. CD1d may also bind another ER-localized molecule, the lipid transfer protein microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) (17Brozovic S. Nagaishi T. Yoshida M. Betz S. Salas A. Chen D. Kaser A.

Cell surface CD1d can be internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and recycles multiple times through the endocytic pathway. A number of accessory molecules facilitate lipid exchange in the endocytic pathway, and this is believed to be a major site of antigen acquisition (for review, see Refs. 1De Libero G. Mori L.

Recent advances in processing and presentation of CD1 bound lipid antigens.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2010; 22: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given that the structure of the CD1d-lipid complex is a key determinant of downstream NKT cell responses, we have been interested in exploring cellular quality control mechanisms that regulate the assembly of these complexes. A related question has been whether there is selectivity in the lipids loaded onto CD1d during assembly. Specific ER-loaded lipids may affect CD1d function by influencing the structure of the CD1d-β2m complex, by being directly sensed by iNKT cells (23Zeissig S. Murata K. Sweet L. Publicover J. Hu Z.

Hepatitis B virus-induced lipid alterations contribute to natural killer T cell-dependent protective immunity.Nat. Med. 2012; 18: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), or by influencing the efficiency with which antigenic lipids can be exchanged for ER-derived lipids in post-ER compartments. The profile of lipids eluted from an ER-retained CD1d variant appears to reflect the composition of bulk ER lipids (21Yuan W. Kang S.J. Evans J.E. Cresswell P. Natural lipid ligands associated with human CD1d targeted to different subcellular compartments.J.

Interestingly, in addition to facilitating folding, CRT binding also controls the rate of export of CD1d from the ER (24Zhu Y. Zhang W. Veerapen N. Besra G. Cresswell P. Calreticulin controls the rate of assembly of CD1d molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 38283-38292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the absence of CRT, functional (and therefore presumably folded) CD1d-β2m complexes form and exit the ER at an accelerated rate. This suggests that CRT has a role in the active retention of folded heavy chains. Therefore, we hypothesized that CRT and the UGT1-mediated ER glycoprotein quality control cycle involving CRT may have a critical functional role in CD1d assembly. UGT1-mediated glycoprotein quality control functions by modification of N-linked glycans on nascent glycoproteins (for review, see Refs. 25Dejgaard S. Nicolay J. Taheri M. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. The ER glycoprotein quality control system.Curr. Issues Mol. Biol. 2004; 6: 29-42PubMed Google Scholar and 26Tamura T. Sunryd J.C. Hebert D.N. Sorting things out through endoplasmic reticulum quality control.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2010; 27: 412-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)). Newly synthesized glycoproteins are co-translationally modified with Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 glycans. These glycans are trimmed to a monoglucosylated form by the sequential action of glucosidase I and glucosidase II. These monoglucosylated glycans mediate interaction of the nascent glycoprotein with the lectin chaperones calnexin and CRT, which facilitate folding and disulfide bond maturation by recruiting the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57. Trimming of the final glucose by glucosidase II releases the glycoprotein from the chaperones. After further glycan processing, properly folded proteins are exported from the ER whereas terminally misfolded proteins are targeted for ER-associated degradation. Substrates that are near-native but not completely folded can enter a rescue pathway mediated by UGT1. The enzyme appears to preferentially recognize such substrates, possibly by sensing surface-exposed hydrophobic patches proximal to N-linked glycosylation sites in near-native molten globule like conformations, and reglucosylates the Man9GlcNAc2 glycan (27Caramelo J.J.

This allows reentry of the glycoprotein into the calnexin/CRT-mediated folding cycle (30Molinari M. N-Glycan structure dictates extension of protein folding or onset of disposal.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that UGT1 preferentially reglucosylates MHC Class I molecules loaded with suboptimal peptides and is thereby able to rescue unstable, suboptimally loaded MHC Class I molecules from degradation (31Wearsch P.A.

In this study we have used UGT1-deficient cells to assess the role of glycoprotein quality control in CD1d assembly and function. The results demonstrate that UGT1-mediated quality control regulates the assembly of CD1d-β2m complexes. In the absence of UGT1, we observe premature release of shorter-lived, potentially unstable complexes. Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that the quality control process affects the antigen presentation function of CD1d, possibly by affecting the repertoire of CD1d-bound lipids.

Other antibodies used were biotinylated goat anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals) and rabbit anti-UGT1 (VAP-PT068; Stressgen). Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and peptide N-glycanase F were obtained from New England Biolabs. Chloroquine was from Sigma. IL-2 was measured using an IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BD Biosciences). α-Galactosylceramide (αGC) and α-galactosyl-(1–2)-galactosylceramide (GGC) were synthesized using established methods. The indicated cell lines were plated in 150-mm plates at either 2.5 million cells/plate on day −2 or 5 million cells/plate on day −1. On day 0, cells were detached and counted, and equal numbers of cells/sample were solubilized on ice in 1% Triton/Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). The lysate was spun at 20,000 × g on a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min to prepare post-nuclear supernatant. Protein concentration was measured using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein, as indicated, were electrophoresed and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Primary antibody dilutions used were: D5, 1:5000; UGT1, 1:1000; GFP, 1:2000. After primary antibody incubation, membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase coupled secondary antibody (1:5000) or streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Detection was done using the Supersignal reagent (Thermo Scientific). For experiments involving EndoH or peptide N-glycanase F digestion, 30 μg of denatured lysate was digested overnight with 200 units of enzyme according to the manufacturer's protocol. On day −1, mouse embryonic fibroblast transfectants were plated at 5 × 106 cells/plate in 150-mm plates. On day 0, cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min with 35S labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 mCi/2.4 × 107 cells. The number of cells to be labeled was calculated such that there would 1.5–2 × 106 cells/lane on the final gels. After labeling, cells were chased in fresh medium with excess unlabeled methionine/cysteine. At the indicated time points, equal aliquots were removed, pelleted, and washed with cold PBS. Cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of 1% digitonin, TBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, EDTA-free). After preparation of post-nuclear supernatant, lysates were precleared with Protein A beads and normal rabbit serum. Lysates were then immunoprecipitated with antibody CD1d51 (specific for CD1d-β2m, 6 μg/sample), D5 (specific for free heavy chain, 3 μg/sample), or both, as indicated in the figure legends. The beads were then stripped by heating to 95 °C in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), TBS, pH 7.4, with 5 mm dithiothreitol. The eluted material was then diluted 10-fold into 1% Triton X-100, TBS with 10 mm iodoacetamide, and the denatured stripped protein was re-immunoprecipitated with D5 antibody (3 μg/sample) and protein A-Sepharose to increase specificity. Immunoprecipitates were then electrophoresed on 12% gels. CD1d-β2m and free heavy chain were quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (Molecular Dynamics) after exposure of dried gels to phosphorimaging screens. When Endo H digestion was performed, precipitated proteins were eluted using Endo H denaturing buffer and incubated overnight with 100 units of EndoH. 0.5 × 106 cells/sample were stained using indicated antibody concentrations as previously described (38Paduraru C. Spiridon L. Yuan W. Bricard G. Valencia X. Porcelli S.A. Illarionov P.A. Besra G.S. Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Cresswell P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 40369-40378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur. The data were analyzed and plotted using the FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc, Ashland, OR). CD1d-transduced KO.UGT1− or KO.UGT1+ cells were used as the APCs for these assays. On day −1, cells were plated at 5 × 106 cells/plate in 150-mm tissue culture plates. On day 0, cells were detached and replated in 100λ hybridoma culture medium at the indicated concentrations (from 30,000 to 100,000 cells/well) in 96-well plates. After allowing 5 h for cells to attach, indicated hybridomas were added at 100,000 cells/well. After an overnight co-culture, the IL-2 concentration in the supernatant was measured using the Opti-ELISA kit from BD Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments involving glycolipid loading, the glycolipid was dispersed from a DMSO stock into culture medium at the indicated concentration by sonication at 37 °C for 15 min. The glycolipid was pulsed for 5 h during the APC reattachment period. APCs were then thoroughly washed with medium five times to remove excess lipid, and hybridoma cells were then added in the absence of lipid for overnight co-culture. To investigate the role of UGT1-mediated quality control in CD1d assembly, we used wild-type (WT) and UGT1-deficient (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (33Soldà T. Galli C. Kaufman R.J. Molinari M. Substrate-specific requirements for UGT1-dependent release from calnexin.Molecular cell. 2007; 27: 238-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As a more stringent test of the specific effects of UGT1 deficiency, we compared KO cells with cells in which UGT1 expression had been reconstituted. To generate the reconstituted cells, KO cells were transduced with the bicistronic retroviral vector MSCV-UGT1-IRES-Thy1.1. The “empty” vector MSCV-IRES-Thy1.1 was used as a negative control. Using Thy1.1 as a surrogate marker for fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS), we separated out a cell line expressing levels of UGT1 close to those seen in WT cells. These cells are henceforth referred to as KO.UGT1+ cells, and cells transduced with the empty vector are referred to as KO.UGT1− cells. All cell lines were also transduced with constructs expressing human CD1d (MSCV-CD1d-IRES-GFP). Using GFP as a transduction marker, we used FACS sorting to isolate pure populations of transduced cells with similar CD1d expression levels. Fig. 1A shows the expression of CD1d, GFP, and UGT1 in WT, UGT1-deficient (KO and KO.UGT1−), and reconstituted cell lines (KO.UGT1+ and KO.UGT1lo). KO.UGT1+ and KO.UGT1lo are cell lin"
https://openalex.org/W2081534049,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bdf1p associates with the basal transcription complexes TFIID and acts as a transcriptional regulator. Lack of Bdf1p is salt sensitive and displays abnormal mitochondrial function. The nucleotidase Hal2p detoxifies the toxic compound 3′ -phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate (pAp), which blocks the biosynthesis of methionine. Hal2p is also a target of high concentration of Na+. Here, we reported that HAL2 overexpression recovered the salt stress sensitivity of bdf1Δ. Further evidence demonstrated that HAL2 expression was regulated indirectly by Bdf1p. The salt stress response mechanisms mediated by Bdf1p and Hal2p were different. Unlike hal2Δ, high Na+ or Li+ stress did not cause pAp accumulation in bdf1Δ and methionine supplementation did not recover its salt sensitivity. HAL2 overexpression in bdf1Δ reduced ROS level and improved mitochondrial function, but not respiration. Further analyses suggested that autophagy was apparently defective in bdf1Δ, and autophagy stimulated by Hal2p may play an important role in recovering mitochondrial functions and Na+ sensitivity of bdf1Δ. Our findings shed new light towards our understanding about the molecular mechanism of Bdf1p-involved salt stress response in budding yeast."

Methods We analyzed a cohort of infants born at 24–31 weeks gestation, admitted to the tertiary intensive care unit of a university hospital over 10.5 years. The outcome measure was “severe adverse outcome” defined as death before discharge or severe neurological injury on cranial ultrasound. The adjusted odd ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of severe adverse outcome for hypoproteinemia (total plasma protein level <40 g/L) was calculated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit) was performed and the predictive ability for severe adverse outcome was assessed for total plasma protein and compared with CRIB, CRIB-II, SNAP-II and SNAPPE-II, by calculating receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and their associated area under the curve (AUC). Results 761 infants were studied: 14.4% died and 4.1% survived with severe cerebral ultrasound findings. The aOR of severe adverse outcome for hypoproteinemia was 6.1 (95% CI 3.8–9.9). The rank order for variables, as assessed by AUCs and 95% CIs, in predicting outcome was: total plasma protein [0.849 (0.821–0.873)], SNAPPE-II [0.822 (0.792–0.848)], CRIB [0.821 (0.792–0.848)], SNAP-II [0.810 (0.780–0.837)] and CRIB-II [0.803 (0.772–0.830)]. Total plasma protein predicted severe adverse outcome significantly better than CRIB-II and SNAP-II (both p<0.05). Calibration for total plasma protein was very good. Conclusions Early hypoproteinemia has prognostic value for severe adverse outcome in very preterm, sick infants. Total plasma protein has a predictive performance comparable with CRIB and SNAPPE-II and greater than other validated severity scores."
https://openalex.org/W1976413847,"Understanding the process of speciation requires understanding how gene flow influences divergence. Recent analyses indicate that divergence can take place despite gene flow and that the sex chromosomes can exhibit different levels of gene flow than autosomes and mitochondrial DNA. Using an eight marker dataset including autosomal, z-linked, and mitochondrial loci we tested the hypothesis that blue-footed (Sula nebouxii) and Peruvian (S. variegata) boobies diverged from their common ancestor with gene flow, paying specific attention to the differences in gene flow estimates from nuclear and mitochondrial markers. We found no gene flow at mitochondrial markers, but found evidence from the combined autosomal and z-linked dataset that blue-footed and Peruvian boobies experienced asymmetrical gene flow during or after their initial divergence, predominantly from Peruvian boobies into blue-footed boobies. This gene exchange may have occurred either sporadically between periods of allopatry, or regularly throughout the divergence process. Our results add to growing evidence that diverging species can remain distinct but exchange genes."
