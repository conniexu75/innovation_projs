https://openalex.org/W2069463594,"A study of the role of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae — a popular vertebrate model for inflammatory and regenerative responses to wounds — reveals a that tissue gradient of H2O2 forms in response to injury of the zebrafish tail fin. The gradient, made visible by the use of a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor protein, is created by the activity of dual oxidase (DUOX) and acts to attract leukocytes to the wound margin during the initial phase of inflammation. This is the first report of a role for H2O2 in signalling to leukocytes, in addition to its established role as an antiseptic. In animals, within minutes of wounding, leukocytes are recruited to the site of injury across distances of hundreds of micrometres. Early leukocyte recruitment after injury is now shown to be driven by the establishment of an H2O2 gradient from the epithelium to the vasculature in zebrafish. Barrier structures (for example, epithelia around tissues and plasma membranes around cells) are required for internal homeostasis and protection from pathogens. Wound detection and healing represent a dormant morphogenetic program that can be rapidly executed to restore barrier integrity and tissue homeostasis. In animals, initial steps include recruitment of leukocytes to the site of injury across distances of hundreds of micrometres within minutes of wounding. The spatial signals that direct this immediate tissue response are unknown. Owing to their fast diffusion and versatile biological activities, reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are interesting candidates for wound-to-leukocyte signalling. Here we probe the role of H2O2 during the early events of wound responses in zebrafish larvae expressing a genetically encoded H2O2 sensor1. This reporter revealed a sustained rise in H2O2 concentration at the wound margin, starting ∼3 min after wounding and peaking at ∼20 min, which extended ∼100–200 μm into the tail-fin epithelium as a decreasing concentration gradient. Using pharmacological and genetic inhibition, we show that this gradient is created by dual oxidase (Duox), and that it is required for rapid recruitment of leukocytes to the wound. This is the first observation, to our knowledge, of a tissue-scale H2O2 pattern, and the first evidence that H2O2 signals to leukocytes in tissues, in addition to its known antiseptic role."
https://openalex.org/W1999324987,"CD8 T cells, which have a crucial role in immunity to infection and cancer, are maintained in constant numbers, but on antigen stimulation undergo a developmental program characterized by distinct phases encompassing the expansion and then contraction of antigen-specific effector (T(E)) populations, followed by the persistence of long-lived memory (T(M)) cells. Although this predictable pattern of CD8 T-cell responses is well established, the underlying cellular mechanisms regulating the transition to T(M) cells remain undefined. Here we show that tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an adaptor protein in the TNF-receptor and interleukin-1R/Toll-like receptor superfamily, regulates CD8 T(M)-cell development after infection by modulating fatty acid metabolism. We show that mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of TRAF6 mount robust CD8 T(E)-cell responses, but have a profound defect in their ability to generate T(M) cells that is characterized by the disappearance of antigen-specific cells in the weeks after primary immunization. Microarray analyses revealed that TRAF6-deficient CD8 T cells exhibit altered expression of genes that regulate fatty acid metabolism. Consistent with this, activated CD8 T cells lacking TRAF6 display defective AMP-activated kinase activation and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in response to growth factor withdrawal. Administration of the anti-diabetic drug metformin restored FAO and CD8 T(M)-cell generation in the absence of TRAF6. This treatment also increased CD8 T(M) cells in wild-type mice, and consequently was able to considerably improve the efficacy of an experimental anti-cancer vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2152817972,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an adult-onset movement disorder of largely unknown etiology. We have previously shown that loss-of-function mutations of the mitochondrial protein kinase PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) cause the recessive PARK6 variant of PD.Now we generated a PINK1 deficient mouse and observed several novel phenotypes: A progressive reduction of weight and of locomotor activity selectively for spontaneous movements occurred at old age. As in PD, abnormal dopamine levels in the aged nigrostriatal projection accompanied the reduced movements. Possibly in line with the PARK6 syndrome but in contrast to sporadic PD, a reduced lifespan, dysfunction of brainstem and sympathetic nerves, visible aggregates of alpha-synuclein within Lewy bodies or nigrostriatal neurodegeneration were not present in aged PINK1-deficient mice. However, we demonstrate PINK1 mutant mice to exhibit a progressive reduction in mitochondrial preprotein import correlating with defects of core mitochondrial functions like ATP-generation and respiration. In contrast to the strong effect of PINK1 on mitochondrial dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster and in spite of reduced expression of fission factor Mtp18, we show reduced fission and increased aggregation of mitochondria only under stress in PINK1-deficient mouse neurons.Thus, aging Pink1(-/-) mice show increasing mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in impaired neural activity similar to PD, in absence of overt neuronal death."

https://openalex.org/W2015323675,"Background Periods of anomalously warm ocean temperatures can lead to mass coral bleaching. Past studies have concluded that anthropogenic climate change may rapidly increase the frequency of these thermal stress events, leading to declines in coral cover, shifts in the composition of corals and other reef-dwelling organisms, and stress on the human populations who depend on coral reef ecosystems for food, income and shoreline protection. The ability of greenhouse gas mitigation to alter the near-term forecast for coral reefs is limited by the time lag between greenhouse gas emissions and the physical climate response. Methodology/Principal Findings This study uses observed sea surface temperatures and the results of global climate model forced with five different future emissions scenarios to evaluate the “committed warming” for coral reefs worldwide. The results show that the physical warming commitment from current accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause over half of the world's coral reefs to experience harmfully frequent (p≥0.2 year−1) thermal stress by 2080. An additional “societal” warming commitment, caused by the time required to shift from a business-as-usual emissions trajectory to a 550 ppm CO2 stabilization trajectory, may cause over 80% of the world's coral reefs to experience harmfully frequent events by 2030. Thermal adaptation of 1.5°C would delay the thermal stress forecast by 50–80 years. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that adaptation – via biological mechanisms, coral community shifts and/or management interventions – could provide time to change the trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions and possibly avoid the recurrence of harmfully frequent events at the majority (97%) of the world's coral reefs this century. Without any thermal adaptation, atmospheric CO2 concentrations may need to be stabilized below current levels to avoid the degradation of coral reef ecosystems from frequent thermal stress events."
https://openalex.org/W2007645750,"Background Skeletons are formed in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and compositions of organic and mineral components. Many invertebrate skeletons are constructed from carbonate or silicate minerals, whereas vertebrate skeletons are instead composed of a calcium phosphate mineral known as apatite. No one yet knows why the dynamic vertebrate skeleton, which is continually rebuilt, repaired, and resorbed during growth and normal remodeling, is composed of apatite. Nor is the control of bone and calcifying cartilage mineralization well understood, though it is thought to be associated with phosphate-cleaving proteins. Researchers have assumed that skeletal mineralization is also associated with non-crystalline, calcium- and phosphate-containing electron-dense granules that have been detected in vertebrate skeletal tissue prepared under non-aqueous conditions. Again, however, the role of these granules remains poorly understood. Here, we review bone and growth plate mineralization before showing that polymers of phosphate ions (polyphosphates: (PO3−)n) are co-located with mineralizing cartilage and resorbing bone. We propose that the electron-dense granules contain polyphosphates, and explain how these polyphosphates may play an important role in apatite biomineralization. Principal Findings/Methodology The enzymatic formation (condensation) and destruction (hydrolytic degradation) of polyphosphates offers a simple mechanism for enzymatic control of phosphate accumulation and the relative saturation of apatite. Under circumstances in which apatite mineral formation is undesirable, such as within cartilage tissue or during bone resorption, the production of polyphosphates reduces the free orthophosphate (PO43−) concentration while permitting the accumulation of a high total PO43− concentration. Sequestering calcium into amorphous calcium polyphosphate complexes can reduce the concentration of free calcium. The resulting reduction of both free PO43− and free calcium lowers the relative apatite saturation, preventing formation of apatite crystals. Identified in situ within resorbing bone and mineralizing cartilage by the fluorescent reporter DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), polyphosphate formation prevents apatite crystal precipitation while accumulating high local concentrations of total calcium and phosphate. When mineralization is required, tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme associated with skeletal and cartilage mineralization, cleaves orthophosphates from polyphosphates. The hydrolytic degradation of polyphosphates in the calcium-polyphosphate complex increases orthophosphate and calcium concentrations and thereby favors apatite mineral formation. The correlation of alkaline phosphatase with this process may be explained by the destruction of polyphosphates in calcifying cartilage and areas of bone formation. Conclusions/Significance We hypothesize that polyphosphate formation and hydrolytic degradation constitute a simple mechanism for phosphate accumulation and enzymatic control of biological apatite saturation. This enzymatic control of calcified tissue mineralization may have permitted the development of a phosphate-based, mineralized endoskeleton that can be continually remodeled."
https://openalex.org/W2048621445,"PTEN-induced novel kinase 1 (PINK1) mutations are associated with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Previous studies have shown that PINK1 influences both mitochondrial function and morphology although it is not clearly established which of these are primary events and which are secondary. Here, we describe a novel mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial morphology related to PINK1. Cell lines were generated by stably transducing human dopaminergic M17 cells with lentiviral constructs that increased or knocked down PINK1. As in previous studies, PINK1 deficient cells have lower mitochondrial membrane potential and are more sensitive to the toxic effects of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We also show that wild-type PINK1, but not recessive mutant or kinase dead versions, protects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial fragmentation whereas PINK1 deficient cells show lower mitochondrial connectivity. Expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) exaggerates PINK1 deficiency phenotypes and Drp1 RNAi rescues them. We also show that Drp1 is dephosphorylated in PINK1 deficient cells due to activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Accordingly, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocks both Drp1 dephosphorylation and loss of mitochondrial integrity in PINK1 deficient cells but does not fully rescue mitochondrial membrane potential. We propose that alterations in mitochondrial connectivity in this system are secondary to functional effects on mitochondrial membrane potential."
https://openalex.org/W2127883880,"Background Exploration of the cognitive systems underlying human friendship will be advanced by identifying the evolved functions these systems perform. Here we propose that human friendship is caused, in part, by cognitive mechanisms designed to assemble support groups for potential conflicts. We use game theory to identify computations about friends that can increase performance in multi-agent conflicts. This analysis suggests that people would benefit from: 1) ranking friends, 2) hiding friend-ranking, and 3) ranking friends according to their own position in partners' rankings. These possible tactics motivate the hypotheses that people possess egocentric and allocentric representations of the social world, that people are motivated to conceal this information, and that egocentric friend-ranking is determined by allocentric representations of partners' friend-rankings (more than others' traits). Methodology/Principal Findings We report results from three studies that confirm predictions derived from the alliance hypothesis. Our main empirical finding, replicated in three studies, was that people's rankings of their ten closest friends were predicted by their own perceived rank among their partners' other friends. This relationship remained strong after controlling for a variety of factors such as perceived similarity, familiarity, and benefits. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the alliance hypothesis merits further attention as a candidate explanation for human friendship."
https://openalex.org/W2046260780,"The recent identification of copy-number variation in the human genome has opened up new avenues for the discovery of positional candidate genes underlying complex genetic disorders, especially in the field of psychiatric disease. One major challenge that remains is pinpointing the susceptibility genes in the multitude of disease-associated loci. This challenge may be tackled by reconstruction of functional gene-networks from the genes residing in these loci. We applied this approach to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and identified the copy-number changes in the DNA of 105 ASD patients and 267 healthy individuals with Illumina Humanhap300 Beadchips. Subsequently, we used a human reconstructed gene-network, Prioritizer, to rank candidate genes in the segmental gains and losses in our autism cohort. This analysis highlighted several candidate genes already known to be mutated in cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, including RAI1, BRD1, and LARGE. In addition, the LARGE gene was part of a sub-network of seven genes functioning in glycobiology, present in seven copy-number changes specifically identified in autism patients with limited co-morbidity. Three of these seven copy-number changes were de novo in the patients. In autism patients with a complex phenotype and healthy controls no such sub-network was identified. An independent systematic analysis of 13 published autism susceptibility loci supports the involvement of genes related to glycobiology as we also identified the same or similar genes from those loci. Our findings suggest that the occurrence of genomic gains and losses of genes associated with glycobiology are important contributors to the development of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2028077749,"HIV-1 can infect and replicate in both CD4 T cells and macrophages. In these cell types, HIV-1 entry is mediated by the binding of envelope glycoproteins (gp120 and gp41, Env) to the receptor CD4 and a coreceptor, principally CCR5 or CXCR4, depending on the viral strain (R5 or X4, respectively). Uninfected CD4 T cells undergo X4 Env-mediated autophagy, leading to their apoptosis, a mechanism now recognized as central to immunodeficiency.We demonstrate here that autophagy and cell death are also induced in the uninfected CD4 T cells by HIV-1 R5 Env, while autophagy is inhibited in productively X4 or R5-infected CD4 T cells. In contrast, uninfected macrophages, a preserved cell population during HIV-1 infection, do not undergo X4 or R5 Env-mediated autophagy. Autophagosomes, however, are present in macrophages exposed to infectious HIV-1 particles, independently of coreceptor use. Interestingly, we observed two populations of autophagic cells: one highly autophagic and the other weakly autophagic. Surprisingly, viruses could be detected in the weakly autophagic cells but not in the highly autophagic cells. In addition, we show that the triggering of autophagy in macrophages is necessary for viral replication but addition of Bafilomycin A1, which blocks the final stages of autophagy, strongly increases productive infection.Taken together, our data suggest that autophagy plays a complex, but essential, role in HIV pathology by regulating both viral replication and the fate of the target cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036276565,"Oncogenic RAS is a highly validated cancer target. Attempts at targeting RAS directly have so far not succeeded in the clinic. Understanding downstream RAS-effectors that mediate oncogenesis in a RAS mutant setting will help tailor treatments that use RAS-effector inhibitors either alone or in combination to target RAS-driven tumors.In this study, we have investigated the sufficiency of targeting RAS-effectors, RAF, MEK and PI3-Kinase either alone or in combination in RAS mutant lines, using an inducible shRNA in vivo mouse model system. We find that in colon cancer cells harboring a KRAS(G13D) mutant allele, knocking down KRAS alone or the RAFs in combination or the RAF effectors, MEK1 and MEK2, together is effective in delaying tumor growth in vivo. In melanoma cells harboring an NRAS(Q61L) or NRAS(Q61K) mutant allele, we find that targeting NRAS alone or both BRAF and CRAF in combination or both BRAF and PIK3CA together showed efficacy.Our data indicates that targeting oncogenic NRAS-driven melanomas require decrease in both pERK and pAKT downstream of RAS-effectors for efficacy. This can be achieved by either targeting both BRAF and CRAF or BRAF and PIK3CA simultaneously in NRAS mutant tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2169286917,"Background The 1400 species of hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) comprise one of most conspicuous and well-studied groups of insects, and provide model systems for diverse biological disciplines. However, a robust phylogenetic framework for the family is currently lacking. Morphology is unable to confidently determine relationships among most groups. As a major step toward understanding relationships of this model group, we have undertaken the first large-scale molecular phylogenetic analysis of hawkmoths representing all subfamilies, tribes and subtribes. Methodology/Principal Findings The data set consisted of 131 sphingid species and 6793 bp of sequence from five protein-coding nuclear genes. Maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses provided strong support for more than two-thirds of all nodes, including strong signal for or against nearly all of the fifteen current subfamily, tribal and sub-tribal groupings. Monophyly was strongly supported for some of these, including Macroglossinae, Sphinginae, Acherontiini, Ambulycini, Philampelini, Choerocampina, and Hemarina. Other groupings proved para- or polyphyletic, and will need significant redefinition; these include Smerinthinae, Smerinthini, Sphingini, Sphingulini, Dilophonotini, Dilophonotina, Macroglossini, and Macroglossina. The basal divergence, strongly supported, is between Macroglossinae and Smerinthinae+Sphinginae. All genes contribute significantly to the signal from the combined data set, and there is little conflict between genes. Ancestral state reconstruction reveals multiple separate origins of New World and Old World radiations. Conclusions/Significance Our study provides the first comprehensive phylogeny of one of the most conspicuous and well-studied insects. The molecular phylogeny challenges current concepts of Sphingidae based on morphology, and provides a foundation for a new classification. While there are multiple independent origins of New World and Old World radiations, we conclude that broad-scale geographic distribution in hawkmoths is more phylogenetically conserved than previously postulated."
https://openalex.org/W2053910444,"Members of the Acr3 family of arsenite permeases confer resistance to trivalent arsenic by extrusion from cells, with members in every phylogenetic domain. In this study bacterial Acr3 homologues from Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Corynebacterium glutamicum were cloned and expressed in Esch e richia coli. Modification of a single cysteine residue that is conserved in all analyzed Acr3 homologues resulted in loss of transport activity, indicating that it plays a role in Acr3 function. The results of treatment with thiol reagents suggested that the conserved cysteine is located in a hydrophobic region of the permease. A scanning cysteine accessibility method was used to show that Acr3 has 10 transmembrane segments, and the conserved cysteine would be predicted to be in the fourth transmembrane segment. Members of the Acr3 family of arsenite permeases confer resistance to trivalent arsenic by extrusion from cells, with members in every phylogenetic domain. In this study bacterial Acr3 homologues from Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Corynebacterium glutamicum were cloned and expressed in Esch e richia coli. Modification of a single cysteine residue that is conserved in all analyzed Acr3 homologues resulted in loss of transport activity, indicating that it plays a role in Acr3 function.

A scanning cysteine accessibility method was used to show that Acr3 has 10 transmembrane segments, and the conserved cysteine would be predicted to be in the fourth transmembrane segment. Arsenic is a carcinogen that ranks first on the Superfund List of Hazardous Substances (www.atsdr.cdc.gov). As a consequence of its environmental ubiquity, nearly every organism, from bacteria to humans, has genes that confer resistance to arsenic (1Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. Nies D.H. Silver S. Molecular Microbiology of Heavy Metals. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York2007: 205-219Google Scholar). The most common mechanism of arsenite resistance is efflux from cells catalyzed by members of three unrelated families of transporters. Homologues of the Mrp members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily catalyze ATP-dependent pumping of As(III)-thiol complexes out of the cytosol. These include Mrp1 and Mrp2 in mammals that extrude As(GS)3 into blood or bile (2Deeley R.G. Westlake C. Cole S.P. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 849-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), Ycf1p in yeast that extrudes As(GS)3 into the vacuole (3Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and PgpA in Leishmania that extrudes the As(III)-trypanothione complex into intracellular compartments (4Légaré D. Richard D. Mukhopadhyay R. Stierhof Y.D. Rosen B.P. Haimeur A. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26301-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). These pumps are generalized resistance pumps and are not specific for arsenite. In contrast, ArsB, the first identified member of the second family of arsenite efflux proteins, has the physiological role of conferring resistance to inorganic As(III) and Sb(III) (5Chen C.M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15030-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The best characterized member of the ArsB family is that encoded by the arsRDABC operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 of Escherichia coli. ArsB is widespread in bacteria and archaea. It has 12 membrane-spanning segments (7Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is similar to members of the Major Facilitator Superfamily (8Marger M.D. Saier Jr., M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 13-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). It transports As(III) but has higher affinity for Sb(III). ArsB is an antiporter that catalyzes the exchange of trivalent metalloid for protons, coupling arsenite efflux to the electrochemical proton gradient (9Meng Y.L. Liu Z. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18334-18341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The third arsenic resistance transporter is Acr3, which is a member of the BART (bile/arsenite/riboflavin transporter) superfamily and includes members found in bacteria, archaea, and fungi and is more widely distributed than members of the ArsB family (10Mansour N.M. Sawhney M. Tamang D.G. Vogl C. Saier Jr., M.H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 612-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Homologues have recently been identified in plant (Pteris vittata, NCBI accession number ACN65413) and animal genomes (Danio rerio, NCBI accession number XP_001921075). Unfortunately, the literature is confused by the fact that many members of the Acr3 family are annotated as ArsB even though they exhibit no significant sequence similarity to ArsB. The first identified member of this family is encoded by the ars operon of the skin (sigK intervening) element in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis (11Sato T. Kobayashi Y. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane topology of the B. subtilis Acr3 was recently investigated using translational fusions, but the results could not distinguish between 8 and 10 transmembrane-spanning segments (TMs) 2The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembrane-spanning segmentSCAMscanning cysteine accessibility methodLBLuria brothAMS4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2-2′disulfonic acidBMbiotin-PE-maleimide(N′-[2-N-maleimido)ethyl]-N-piperazinyl-d-biotinamide hydrochloride. (12Aaltonen E.K. Silow M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fungal members of this family include the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Acr3p metalloid efflux protein (3Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Bobrowicz P. Wysocki R. Owsianik G. Goffeau A. Ułaszewski S. Yeast. 1997; 13: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast Acr3p appears to be selective for As(III) over Sb(III), which is surprising considering the similarity in chemical properties between the two metalloids. The properties of a more distant homologue from Shewanella oneidensis was examined recently (14Xia X. Postis V.L. Rahman M. Wright G.S. Roach P.C. Deacon S.E. Ingram J.C. Henderson P.J. Findlay J.B. Phillips S.E. McPherson M.J. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The S. oneidensis homologue confers resistance to arsenate but not arsenite. Similarly, the purified protein binds arsenate, not arsenite, indicating that this protein is not an Acr3 orthologue. transmembrane-spanning segment scanning cysteine accessibility method Luria broth 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2-2′disulfonic acid biotin-PE-maleimide(N′-[2-N-maleimido)ethyl]-N-piperazinyl-d-biotinamide hydrochloride. Here we examined the properties of Acr3 orthologues from Alkaliphilus metalliredigens and Corynebacterium glutamicum (supplemental Fig. 1). A. metalliredigens is a borate-tolerant Gram-positive alkaliphile and strict anaerobe that uses reduction of metals as electron acceptors (15Ye Q. Roh Y. Carroll S.L. Blair B. Zhou J. Zhang C.L. Fields M.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5595-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is a novel metal-reducing bacterium that is distantly related to other commonly studied iron-reducing microorganisms. The genome of A. metalliredigens QYMF (NCBI accession number NC_009633) contains two novel ars operons, arsR1Bacr3–1D1A1–1A1–2 and arsR2CBacr3–2D2A2–1A2–2. The two genes for the AmAcr3s were designated arsacr3 because they are both in ars operons and are controlled by ArsR repressors, even though they are not homologues of ArsB. Interestingly, both ars operons have genes for ArsD and two genes corresponding to the two homologous halves of ArsA, which we designate AmArsA1 and AmArsA2. ArsD is an arsenic chaperone that transfers As(III) to ArsA (16Lin Y.F. Walmsley A.R. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15617-15622Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which then interacts with ArsB to extrude As(III) from the cells in an ATP-dependent manner (6Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 190-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Dey S. Dou D. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25442-25446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dey S. Dou D. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 418-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Whether or how Acr3 can replace ArsB in this process is a question of considerable interest. C. glutamicum is a Gram-positive soil bacterium that is used for commercial production of glutamate, lysine, and other amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins and from which the genome sequence has been described (NCBI accession number NC_006958). It is highly arsenic-resistant and has three genes encoding Acr3 homologues (19Ordóñez E. Letek M. Valbuena N. Gil J.A. Mateos L.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6206-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Two of the homologues are in ars operons regulated by ArsRs (arsR1Bacr3–1C1C1′ and arsR2Bacr3–2arsC2) and a third orphan gene (arsBacr3–3) that is not in an operon and may not be expressed to the same extent as the other two. (Again, the genes were misnamed arsB even though they encode Acr3 homologues.) The genes for AmAcr3 and CgAcr3 from the ars1 operons of the respective species were cloned and expressed in the arsenite-hypersensitive E. coli strain AW3110, in which the chromosomal arsRBC operon had been deleted (20Carlin A. Shi W. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 981-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Both conferred resistance to arsenite but not arsenate or antimonite. Examination of the sequence of Acr3 homologues from many species indicates that there is conserved cysteine residues, Cys138 in AmAcr3 and Cys129 in CgAcr3 (supplemental Fig. 1). Those and other nonconserved cysteine residues were changed by mutagenesis, and substitution of only Cys138 in AmAcr3 and Cys129 in CgAcr3 led to loss of function, suggesting that the conserved cysteine residue participates in As(III) transport. A scanning cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) (21Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods. 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used to determine the transmembrane topology of AmAcr3. SCAM analysis is preferable to the use of gene fusions because there are minimal structural changes in the membrane protein, and the sidedness of inserted cysteines can be unambiguously determined with maleimide reagents of differing membrane permeability. A series of single cysteine mutants of AmAcr3 was constructed and the reactivity of each cysteine residue assayed. The results unambiguously demonstrate that Acr3 has 10 TMs. Strains and plasmids used are given in supplemental Tables 1 and 2. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin, as required. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring the A600 nm. The thiol reagents iodoacetamide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and methyl methanethiosulfonate were from Sigma. N-Ethylmaleimide was from Pierce. Biotin-PE-maleimide (N′-[2-N-maleimido)ethyl]-N-piperazinyl-d-biotinamide hydrochloride (BM), and 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were obtained from commercial sources. The acr3 genes were cloned by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotide primers for PCR are given in supplemental Table 3. For expression of acr3 from A. metalliredigens in E. coli, plasmid pTrcHis2A-AmAcr3-His, in which the Amacr3 gene is under the control of the trc promoter and has the sequence for a C-terminal His tag, was constructed. Chromosomal DNA from A. metalliredigens QYMF was provided by Matthew W. Fields (Miami University, Oxford, OH) (15Ye Q. Roh Y. Carroll S.L. Blair B. Zhou J. Zhang C.L. Fields M.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5595-5602Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). After the PCR, the 1.1-kb DNA fragment was gel-purified (Qiagen) and digested with NcoI and HindIII overnight. After gel purification, the DNA fragment was ligated into vector plasmid pTrcHis2A accordingly digested, generating plasmid pTrcHis2A-AmAcr3-His. A similar strategy was used to clone the Cgacr3 gene using chromosomal DNA from C. glutamicum strain ATCC 13032 (19Ordóñez E. Letek M. Valbuena N. Gil J.A. Mateos L.M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2005; 71: 6206-6215Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and the corresponding primers indicated in supplemental Table 3. The PCR-amplified band (1,113 bp) was subcloned into pGEM®-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The Cgacr3 gene was then PCR-amplified using the primer pair Cgacr3-NcoI forward/HindIII reverse, and the isolated 1.1-kb band was NcoI and HindIII digested and further ligated into pTrcHis2A generating plasmid pTrcHis2A-CgAcr3-His. Mutants in acr3 genes from both organisms were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers listed in supplemental Table 4. The identity of the mutated nucleotides was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cys129 and Cys141 in CgAcr3 were changed to C129S, C141S, C129A, and C129S/C141S. Residues Cys27, Cys91, and Cys138 in AmAcr3 were changed to C27S, C91S, C138S, C138A, C27S/C91S, and C27S/C91S/C138S. For the topological studies by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, the AmAcr3 C27S/C91S double mutant was used as the “Cys-less” backbone, and 33 single cysteine derivatives from the Cys-less were created by PCR mutagenesis (23Kirsch R.D. Joly E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table 2). For arsenite resistance assays, cultures of E. coli strain AW3110 harboring plasmids were grown in LB medium overnight and diluted 100-fold into fresh LB medium containing the indicated concentrations of sodium arsenite or potassium antimonyl tartrate at 37 °C with shaking. After 6 h of growth at 37 °C, A600 nm was measured. SCAM analysis of the topology of AmAcr3 was performed by labeling site-directed cysteines with sulfhydryl reagents, as described (21Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods. 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with a few minor modifications. Mutant Amacr3 genes were transformed into cells of E. coli strain AW3110 Δars, which lacks arsB, and grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C, diluted 50-fold into fresh LB, and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, when the A600 nm reached 0.5–0.6. After induction, the cells were washed with a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m KCl (buffer A). To block cysteines exposed in the periplasm, the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent AMS was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for 10 min at 30 °C. Next 2 μl of 25 mm BM was added to label cysteine residues exposed in the cytosol. BM is membrane-permeable and can react with thiol groups on either side of the membrane, but cysteine residues buried in hydrophobic TMs are not labeled. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 1 ml of the same buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were washed once with buffer A and suspended in 2 ml of a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer B). The cells were lysed by a single pass through a French press cell at 20,000 p.s.i., and 2.5 μl of di-isopropyl fluorophosphates/g of wet cell was added immediately. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min to remove cell debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h, and the membrane fraction obtained was suspended in 1 ml of buffer B containing 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize the inner membrane. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, following which the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant solution was mixed with 15 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Invitrogen) and incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed five times with 0.5 ml of buffer B and then suspended in 15 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and boiled for 10 min. SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels. AmAcr3 was detected by immunoblotting using mouse anti-His tag antibody (Novagen, Madison, WI) and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For uptake assays, 50-ml cultures were grown to A600 nm = 1 at 37 °C with aeration in LB medium. The cells were harvested, washed, and suspended in a buffer consisting of 75 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, and 1 mm MgSO4 (buffer C) at a density of A600 nm = 10. To initiate the transport reaction, either sodium arsenite (100 μm, final concentration) or potassium antimonyl tartrate (50 μm, final concentration) was added to 1 ml of cell suspension. Portions (0.1 ml) were withdrawn at the indicated time, filtered through 0.2-μm pore size nitrocellulose filters (Whatman), washed twice with 4 ml of buffer C, and air dried. For assays in which the cells were treated with thiol-modifying reagents, 50 ml of freshly grown cells were centrifuged and washed twice at A600 nm = 1 with buffer C lacking MgSO4 and suspended in 25 ml of the same buffer. The cells were then equilibrated at 37 °C, and an equal volume of the same buffer containing 2 mm EDTA was added. After 5 min, 10 mm MgSO4 was added. The EDTA-treated cells were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in the buffer C at a density of A600 nm = 10. Thiol-modifying reagents were added as indicated for 10 min before initiating the transport reaction by addition of 100 μm sodium arsenite. The filters were digested with 0.3 ml of concentrated HNO3 (69–70%) (EM Science, Gibbstown, NJ) at 70 °C for 30 min, allowed to cool to room temperature, and diluted with 5.7 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography grade water (Sigma) to produce a final concentration of HNO3 of ∼4%. Arsenic and antimony were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Standard solutions were made in the range of 0.5–150 ppb in 4% HNO3 using arsenic and antimony standards (Ultra Scientific, N. Kingstown, RI). Both C. glutamicum and A. metalliredigens have two operons containing acr3 genes, and all four Acr3s exhibit considerable similarity with other Acr3 homologues (supplemental Fig. 1). Of interest is that one cysteine residue, Cys138 in AmAcr3 and Cys129 in CgAcr3, is conserved in all homologues examined. One acr3 gene was cloned from each organism and expressed in E. coli strain AW3110. Both CgAcr3 (Fig. 1, A and B) and AmAcr3 (data not shown) were functional in arsenite resistance and able to reduce the intracellular concentration of As(III), which reflects the ability to catalyze extrusion. Neither CgAcr3 (Fig. 1, C and D) nor AmAcr3 (data not shown) could confer resistance or extrude Sb(III). This is consistent with the observation that yeast ScAcr3p confers resistance to As(III) but not Sb(III) (3Ghosh M. Shen J. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5001-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 25Wysocki R. Bobrowicz P. Ułaszewski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30061-30066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This is a striking finding considering the chemical similarities of the two trivalent metalloids. Note that ArsB extrudes both trivalent metalloids and confers resistance to both (Fig. 1), indicating that there might be a fundamental mechanistic difference between ArsB and Acr3. There are three cysteines in AmAcr3 (Cys27, Cys91, and Cys138). Each was altered to serine or alanine, generating single mutants C27S, C91S, C138S, and C138A, the double mutant C27S/C91S, and the triple mutant C27S/C91S/C138S. The function of each cysteine residue was analyzed by the ability to confer As(III) resistance in the arsenite-hypersensitive E. coli strain AW3110 (Fig. 2A) and to reduce the intracellular concentration of As(III) (Fig. 2B). The data show that neither Cys27 nor Cys91 are crucial for AmAcr3 function. In contrast, cells expressing mutants C138S and C138A were sensitive to and unable to extrude arsenite, suggesting that conserved Cys138 plays a role in Acr3 function. To examine further whether the conserved cysteine is required for Acr3 function, Cys129 and Cys141 in CgAcr3 were mutated to C129S, C141S, C129A, and C129S/C141S, and the effect of the substitutions on resistance (Fig. 2C) and transport (Fig. 2D) was assayed. Consistent with the results with AmAcr3, only cells expressing the Cys129 mutants of CgAcr3 exhibited arsenite sensitivity and loss of transport activity, supporting the view that the conserved cysteine plays a role in Acr3 function. To investigate the requirement for the conserved cysteine in more detail, uptake of As(III) was assayed in cells of AW3110 expressing wild type CgAcr3 and the C141S mutant, which has only conserved Cys129 treated with several different thiol reagents (Fig. 3). The cells were first treated with EDTA to permeabilize the outer membrane and then with 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Fig. 3B) or p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (Fig. 3C), which are membrane-impermeant, or the membrane-permeable thiol reagent N-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 3D) (26Olsowski A. Monden I. Keller K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10738-10745Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 27Zoccarato F. Cavallini L. Valente M. Alexandre A. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 274: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Tamura N. Konishi S. Iwaki S. Kimura-Someya T. Nada S. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20330-20339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Arsenite accumulation in cells expressing wild type CgAcr3 and the C141S mutant was not affected by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) or p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate. In contrast, the permeable reagent N-ethylmaleimide inactivated As(III) efflux. Similarly, accumulation was inhibited by the permeant thiol-modifying reagents methyl methanethiosulfonate and iodoacetamide (data not shown). As a control, arsenite accumulation in cells of E. coli AW3110 expressing ArsB, which has no critical thiols (29Chen Y. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 911-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was unaffected by any of the thiol reagents. These results suggest first that the conserved cysteine in Acr3 participates in As(III) translocation and second that it may be located in a hydrophobic transmembrane region, a prediction verified by the topological analysis below. Although ArsB has 12 TM segments (7Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Acr3 has been predicted to have only 10 TMs (12Aaltonen E.K. Silow M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We compared predictions for AmAcr3 from three different topological analysis programs, TopPred2, SOSUI, and S-TMHMM. These generated two different theoretical models, one with nine TMs (TopPred 2) and the other with 10 TMs (SOSUI and S-TMHMM) (Fig. 4). It is worth mentioning that in all predicted models, the conserved residue Cys138 is located in a transmembrane region. An incomplete topological analysis of the B. subtilis Acr3 generated using translational fusions could not distinguish between 8 and 10 transmembrane segments (12Aaltonen E.K. Silow M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, SCAM (21Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods. 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) was used to determine experimentally the transmembrane topology of AmAcr3. Starting with the C27S/C91S double mutant of AmAcr3, which has only Cys138, 33 single mutants containing only a single additional cysteine residue were constructed covering all predicted hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Cys138 is necessary for function, but as shown below, it does not react with any of the SCAM reagents, and therefore the C27S/C91S mutant in effect provides the Cys-less backbone required for SCAM analysis. The expression of each in E. coli AW3110 was examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Each of the mutants was expressed, although some (V6C, T156C, T182C, and L258C) were expressed at lower levels than wild type. Their ability to confer resistance to arsenite was determined (Fig. 5B). Except for the G151C mutant, each conferred resistance. Some mutants such as T81C, T190C, L203C, A307C, S319C, and S343C were somewhat less resistant at higher concentrations of arsenite. However, more important than the absolute levels of expression or resistance, the fact that they clearly retain function indicates that they should have an overall topology similar to that of the wild type, which makes them useful for SCAM analysis. To determine topology using SCAM, the cells were first treated with BM, and the BM-labeled Acr3 proteins were pulled down with streptavidin-conjugated beads after solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100. Biotinylated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with His tag antibody. BM is membrane-permeable and reacts with cysteine thiolates accessible on either side of the membrane but not with cysteines in TMs. The wild type, the mutants with Cys27 or Cys91, and 16 mutants with introduced cysteine residues (A40C, S54C, I97C, L127C, A130C, T149C, I174C, T190C, L203C, V236C, V252C, I263C, S282C, A307C, T313C, and T325C) did not react with BM (Fig. 6A), indicating that they are in a TM or otherwise not exposed to bulk solvent. Note that neither wild type AmAcr3 nor the Cys-less variant reacted with BM, indicating that none of the three native cysteine residues (Cys27, Cys91, and conserved Cys138) are solvent-exposed and are quite possibly in transmembrane regions. The 17 mutants that reacted with BM were analyzed further by reacting with AMS, which is impermeant and reacts with periplasmic cysteine residues. The mutants were then reacted with BM, which would react with the remaining cysteine residues that are exposed in the cytosol. AMS prevented biotinylation of seven mutants (S46C, S121C, T182C, V186C, S255C, L258C, and S319C) (Fig. 6B), indicating that these residues are exposed to the periplasm. The other 10 residues (V6C, S76C, T81C, G151C, T156C, I219C, L287C, S293C, S343C, and T346C) reacted with BM even after AMS treatment, indicating that the residues in those mutants are most likely exposed to the cytosol. These results are consistent with a topological model of 10 TMs with the N and C termini in the cytosol (Fig. 7). Note that this model makes several predictions. First, the conserved cysteine residue is located in TM4, and second that Gly151 is in a short cytosolic loop. The G151C mutant may not have sufficient flexibility to allow for proper orientation of TM4 and TM5, which may explain its inability to confer arsenite resistance.FIGURE 7Topology of AmAcr3.

One of the most widespread arsenic efflux proteins is Acr3, which is found in members of every kingdom. Yet little is known about the mechanism of Acr3 transport. In this study we examined the transport properties of two Acr3 permeases from two quite different bacteria, the iron-reducing alkaliphile, A. metalliredigens QYMF, and a soil bacterium, C. glutamicum. Both organisms have two ars operons, each containing an acr3 gene, and consequently, both organisms are extremely arsenic-resistant. One acr3 gene from each was cloned and expressed in a strain of E. coli in which the chromosomal arsRBC operon had been deleted and so is extremely arsenic-sensitive. Both acr3 genes complemented the arsenite sensitivity quite well, and both catalyzed arsenite efflux from cells, allowing the first in vivo analysis of Acr3 transport properties. The first very striking observation is that Acr3 can distinguish between As(III) and Sb(III) (Fig. 1). This had been inferred from the phenotype of yeast expressing ScAcr3p but never directly demonstrated before (25Wysocki R. Bobrowicz P. Ułaszewski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30061-30066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Considering metalloid chemistry, this is unexpected. Both As(III) and Sb(III) are three-coordinate metals that bind to two or three cysteines in other arsenic resistance proteins, including ArsA (30Ruan X. Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9925-9934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), ArsD (31Lin Y.F. Yang J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16783-16791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and three different ArsRs (32Qin J. Fu H.L. Ye J. Bencze K.Z. Stemmler T.L. Rawlings D.E. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34346-34355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Shi W. Dong J. Scott R.A. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25706-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Even ArsB, which uses no cysteines in its translocation mechanism, is not selective for As(III) over Sb(III) (29Chen Y. Dey S. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 911-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a somewhat related arsenic resistance protein from a Gram-negative anaerobe, S. oneidensis, transports pentavalent arsenate and not As(III) or Sb(III) (14Xia X. Postis V.L. Rahman M. Wright G.S. Roach P.C. Deacon S.E. Ingram J.C. Henderson P.J. Findlay J.B. Phillips S.E. McPherson M.J. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2008; 25: 691-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Other members of the BART superfamily transport a variety of substrates, including riboflavin, bile salts, and other organic anions (10Mansour N.M. Sawhney M. Tamang D.G. Vogl C. Saier Jr., M.H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 612-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The basis for substrate specificity in members of this superfamily is not clear. However, one feature that distinguishes the As(III) carriers from other superfamily members appears to be a conserved cysteine residue (supplemental Fig. 1). Modification of this cysteine, either by mutagenesis (Fig. 2) or chemical modification (Fig. 3), leads to loss of transport activity. A reasonable deduction is that the conserved cysteine is involved in As(III) translocation. This residue is located in the middle of a transmembrane segment (Fig. 7), and it is tempting to speculate that thiol chemistry is involved in translocation. Even though single thiols bind trivalent arsenic with low affinity, so that As(III) might bind weakly on one side of the membrane, the low affinity would facilitate release of As(III) from the carrier on the other side of the membrane. Acr3 and ArsB are similar in that both are secondary carriers that extrude As(III) from cells. However, they differ not only in selectivity but also in transmembrane topology. ArsB has 12 TMs (7Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretical topological analysis of Acr3 suggested 9 or 10 TMs (Fig. 4), and experimental analysis of the B. subtilis Acr3 indicated either 8 or 10 TMs (12Aaltonen E.K. Silow M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, gene fusions were used in that study, so the results give the topology of inactive truncated membrane proteins and not the native active permease. The use of SCAM provides for topological determination of intact and active membrane proteins (21Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods. 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using this method, Acr3 was shown to have 10 TMs (Fig. 7). The location of the conserved cysteine residue in TM4 is consistent with a role in As(III) translocation. Preliminary data indicate that arsenite efflux via Acr3 is coupled to the protonmotive force, 3H. L. Fu and B. P. Rosen, manuscript in preparation. but how is not clear. ArsB is an antiporter in which As(OH)3 is exchanged for H+, and the counter-transport is driven by the protonmotive force. It is possible that Acr3 functions similarly. However, another possibility is that Acr3 is a uniporter that transports the arsenite anion As(OH)2O− coupled to the membrane potential, which is positive outside in cells and positive inside in membrane vesicles (Fig. 8). The pKa of As(OH)3 is 9.2, so a few percent would be ionized in the cytosol of E. coli and even more in the cytosol of alkaliphiles. In contrast, the pKa of Sb(OH)3 is 11.8; hence, at the neutral pH of the E. coli cytosol, there would essentially be no antimonite anion. This difference in pKa between the two trivalent metalloids might explain the ability of Acr3 to discriminate between As(III) and Sb(III). To elucidate the mechanism of Acr3 catalysis requires a more detailed structure-function analysis. We thank Matthew W.

In INS-1E cells 2 mM glucose down-regulated ZnT-3 and up-regulated ZnT-5 expression relative to 5 mM. 16 mM glucose increased ZnT-3 and decreased ZnT-8 expression. Zinc chelation by DEDTC lowered INS-1E insulin content and insulin expression. Furthermore, zinc depletion increased ZnT-3- and decreased ZnT-8 gene expression whereas the amount of ZnT-3 protein in the cells was decreased. Zinc depletion and high glucose induced apoptosis and necrosis in INS-1E cells. The most responsive zinc transporter, ZnT-3, was investigated further; by immunohistochemistry and western blotting ZnT-3 was demonstrated in INS-1E cells. 44% knock-down of ZnT-3 by siRNA transfection in INS-1E cells decreased insulin expression and secretion. Streptozotocin-treated mice had higher glucose levels after ZnT-3 knock-out, particularly in overt diabetic animals.Zinc transporting proteins in beta-cells respond to variations in glucose and zinc levels. ZnT-3, which is pivotal in the development of cellular changes as also seen in type 2 diabetes (e.g. amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease) but not previously described in beta-cells, is present in this cell type, up-regulated by glucose in a concentration dependent manner and up-regulated by zinc depletion which by contrast decreased ZnT-3 protein levels. Knock-down of the ZnT-3 gene lowers insulin secretion in vitro and affects in vivo glucose metabolism after streptozotocin treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2040966958,"Density-enhanced phosphatase-1 (DEP-1) is a trans-membrane receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase that plays a recognized prominent role as a tumor suppressor. However, the mechanistic details underlying its function are poorly understood because its primary physiological substrate(s) have not been firmly established. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative role of this phosphatase, we set out to identify new DEP-1 substrates by a novel approach based on screening of high density peptide arrays. The results of the array experiment were combined with a bioinformatics filter to identify eight potential DEP-1 targets among the proteins annotated in the MAPK pathway. In this study we show that one of these potential targets, the ERK1/2, is indeed a direct DEP-1 substrate in vivo. Pulldown and in vitro dephosphorylation assays confirmed our prediction and demonstrated an overall specificity of DEP-1 in targeting the phosphorylated tyrosine 204 of ERK1/2. After epidermal growth factor stimulation, the phosphorylation of the activation loop of ERK1/2 can be modulated by changing the concentration of DEP-1, without affecting the activity of the upstream kinase MEK. In addition, we show that DEP-1 contains a KIM-like motif to recruit ERK1/2 proteins by a docking mechanism mediated by the common docking domain in ERK1/2. ERK proteins that are mutated in the conserved docking domain become insensitive to DEP-1 de-phosphorylation.

In addition, several epithelial cell types display DEP-1 on their cell membranes (3Autschbach F. Palou E. Mechtersheimer G. Rohr C. Pirotto F. Gassler N. Otto H.F. Schraven B. Gaya A.

Moreover, accumulating evidence supports a prominent role for DEP-1 as a tumor suppressor as it negatively regulates cell proliferation and is poorly expressed in many cancer cell lines (6Balavenkatraman K.K.

The observed anti-proliferative effect may be accounted for by the ability of DEP-1 to down-regulate growth factor signaling through the dephosphorylation of various receptor tyrosine kinases, such as PDGFR, VEGFR2, and MET (11Kovalenko M.

However, given the complex pleiotropic functions of DEP-1, it is also possible that additional regulatory circuits mediated by yet unknown DEP-1 substrates may play a functional role in contact inhibition and control of cell proliferation. density-enhanced phosphatase-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase epidermal growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphate-buffered saline human embryonic kidney glutathione S-transferase protein-tyrosine phosphatase tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate kinase interaction motif short hairpin RNA common docking. density-enhanced phosphatase-1 mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase epidermal growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphate-buffered saline human embryonic kidney glutathione S-transferase protein-tyrosine phosphatase tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate kinase interaction motif short hairpin RNA common docking. A variety of in vivo and in vitro approaches has led us to propose a number of DEP-1 substrates as mediators of its function.

Here we report a novel, unbiased strategy based on the screening of high density phosphopeptide arrays for their ability to bind phosphatase trapping mutants. A large portion of the phosphoproteome could be explored by this approach, thus unveiling a long list of potential substrates. A selected list of potentially relevant substrates has been obtained by applying a bioinformatics context filter. In this study we report the detailed characterization of one of these substrates, and we propose that DEP-1 modulates the RAS pathway by directly dephosphorylating Tyr-204 of ERK1/2. In addition, we show that the efficient removal of the phosphate group from Tyr-204 requires the integrity of a docking site on the ERK1/2 proteins.

The FLAG-ERK2 D319A and HA-DEP-1 K1016A mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). After transformation, colonies of Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta containing the indicated GST fusion proteins were used to inoculate LB cultures with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.5 was reached. Protein expression was at 30 °C for 4 h after the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 100 μm. Pelleted bacteria were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl) plus a 250 mm proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by treatment with lysozyme (200 μg/ml final) for 1 h on ice followed by three rounds of sonication. The lysates were clarified by spinning at 14,000 rpm for 20 min and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h. Finally, beads were extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 100 mm dithiothreitol, and the PTPs were eluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, with 10 mm glutathione. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%; the amount of proteins produced was determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay, and aliquots were stocked at −80 °C until use. A chip containing ∼6000 phosphopeptides in three repeated subarrays was used. 5M. Tinti, S. Costa, L. Kiemer, M. Miller, F. Sacco, J. Olsen, M. Carducci, S. Paoluzi, C. Workman, N. Blom, K. Machida, C. Thomson, M. Schutkowski, S. Brunak, M. Mann, B. Mayer, L. Castagnoli, and G. Cesareni, manuscript in preparation. To choose the peptides to be synthesized and printed, we first downloaded from Phospho-ELM (20Diella F. Cameron S. Gemünd C. Linding R. Via A. Kuster B. Sicheritz-Pontén T. Blom N. Gibson T.J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2004; 5: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) 1604 phosphorylated peptides that have been identified in high and low throughput experiments with the aim to characterize the phospho-proteome in Homo sapiens. To this list we added 4453 peptides that had a high score according to the NetPhos predictive algorithm (21Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Each chip contains three identical replicated arrays (subarray), and each subarray contains the phosphorylated peptides and several control spots arranged in a grid of 6400 positions. As shown in the Fig. 1, each peptide maintains the same grid position in the three subarrays. The peptides were synthesized and arrayed by Jerini Peptide Technology according to their proprietary technology. After 1 h of blocking in 5% PBS/bovine serum albumin, the phosphopeptide array was incubated with 1 μg/ml GST-DEP-1. The chip was washed in PBS and incubated at 1:1000 with anti-GST Cy-5-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) avoiding light exposure. The chip was extensively washed in PBS, and fluorescence intensity was revealed with ScanArray Gx Plus (PerkinElmer Life Science). Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells and human epithelial carcinoma (HeLa) cells were purchased from the ATCC. Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco舗s modified Eagle舗s medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer舗s protocol. After 5 h of starvation in fetal calf serum-free media, cell were stimulated with 100 μg/ml EGF (Invitrogen) for the indicated time. After EGF stimulation, confluent HeLa cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 1 mm pervanadate, 1 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture 200× (Sigma), inhibitor phosphatase mixture I and II 100× (Sigma). The samples were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected, and the total amount of protein was determined by Bradford colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). The whole cell lysates were incubated with 50 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein at 4 °C for 1 h. Thus glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were blocked by incubating with 3% bovine serum albumin with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, and then after centrifugation for 3 min at 4000 × g, at 4 °C, the dry beads were bound to lysates mixed with GST fusion proteins at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatant was discarded by centrifugation, and the beads were washed six times with lysis buffer for 3 min at 4000 × g, at 4 °C, and then the dry beads were resuspended in 50 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting on nitrocellulose membrane. HEK293 cells were transfected with SRC and HA-ERK2 expression plasmids. Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm pervanadate, 1 mm NaF, protease inhibitor mixture 200× (Sigma), inhibitor phosphatases mixture I and II 100×, and supernatants were clarified by spinning at 15,000 rpm, at 4 °C, for 30 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody anti-HA overnight at 4 °C, and then protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer, the dry beads were incubated with 1 μg of the indicated GST fusion protein in reaction buffer for 15 or 30 min. For the vanadate competition assay, 1 mm Na3VO4 was added to PTPase assay buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies. The catalytic activity of the fusion proteins was checked using p-nitrophenyl phosphate assay. The reaction was stopped by adding 2 m NaOH, and the enzymatic activity was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405. The enzyme activity (μmol/min/μg) was calculated from Beer-Lambert law. HEK293 cells were lysed as described previously. The whole cell lysates were incubated with antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and then protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies. The immunoreactions were visualized using ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells plated onto glass coverslips at ∼50% confluency were cotransfected using Lipofectamine with pRSα DEP-1WT/HA and pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). 24 h following transfection cells were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (EM Sciences), washed with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and permeabilized with the blocking solution (0.1% Triton 10% fetal calf serum) for 30 min. Coverslips were incubated in humidified chambers, in blocking solution, with anti-DEP-1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed in PBS and stained with anti-mouse TRITC antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS, 0.1% Triton for 5 min at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted on slides as described and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy Leica DMR. The interactions described in this study have been submitted to the MINT data base (22Chatr-aryamontri A. Ceol A. Palazzi L.M. Nardelli G. Schneider M.V. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) following the MIMIX recommendations (23Orchard S. Salwinski L. Kerrien S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Oesterheld M.

To investigate the enzymatic specificity of DEP-1 and to define its substrate landscape, we purified the trapping mutant phosphatase enzymatic domain as a GST fusion, and we probed it with a library of ∼6,000 tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides arrayed on a glass surface. After measuring phosphatase binding with an anti-GST antibody conjugated to a fluorophore, we defined “DEP-1 putative targets” as the 215 peptides with a signal intensity larger than the median signal plus two standard deviations (Fig. 1). This relatively large list of putative DEP-1 substrates was mapped onto the MAPK pathway, as annotated in the KEGG data base (24Kanehisa M. Novartis Found. Symp. 2002; 247 (119– 128, 244– 252): 91-101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and only peptides whose in vivo phosphorylation could be supported by experimental evidence in the Phosphosite data base (25Hornbeck P.V. Chabra I. Kornhauser J.M. Skrzypek E. Zhang B. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1551-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) were considered. Using this filtering procedure, we re-discovered PDGFR, a known DEP-1 substrate (11Kovalenko M. Denner K. Sandström J. Persson C. Gross S. Jandt E. Vilella R. Böhmer F. Ostman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16219-16226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and we inferred seven new putative substrates (EGF receptor, GRB2, RAF-1, ERK1/2, AKT, FLNA, and JIP3). In this study we focused on the 199TGFLTEpYVATRWY210 peptide shared by ERK1/2 proteins, as previous experimental evidence had already revealed a negative correlation between DEP-1 expression and ERK1/2 activation in tumor cell lines and in response to different growth stimuli (11Kovalenko M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Validation of the remaining inferred substrates is hampered by the presence of multiple phosphorylated tyrosine residues and requires the development of reagents to specifically monitor their phosphorylation levels. The results of the array experiment suggested that the DEP-1 trapping mutant binds the ERK1/2 peptide containing Tyr-204 in its phosphorylated form. To confirm this interaction in a full-length protein and cellular context and to assess its specificity, we performed a pulldown assay with 15 trapping mutants of different PTPs. As shown in Fig. 2A, DEP-1 can efficiently bind ERK1/2, whereas other phosphatases bind to different phosphorylated proteins but cannot affinity purify ERK1/2. Interestingly SAP-1, whose amino acid sequence is related to DEP-1, also binds ERK1/2. Next, to exclude that the observed interaction could occur outside the PTP catalytic pocket, we compared two pulldown experiments using as a bait the wild type or the trapping mutant version of the catalytic domain of DEP-1 (Fig. 2B). Only the trapping mutant could be shown to bind to ERK1/2 proteins providing further support to the notion of a direct interaction of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and the catalytic site of the DEP-1 phosphatase. To demonstrate that the observed binding is dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr-204, we performed the pulldown experiment at different times after EGF induction. The observation that the amount of affinity-purified ERK1/2 is proportional to Tyr-204 phosphorylation levels, as probed with a specific antibody recognizing the phosphorylated Tyr-204, indicates that the interaction occurs only when ERK1/2 is phosphorylated in the activation loop (Fig. 2, C and D). The association of phospho-ERK1/2 proteins with the DEP-1 trapping mutant but not with the wild type catalytic domain implies that ERK1/2 is a substrate of DEP-1 enzymatic activity. To investigate whether purified ERK1/2 can be dephosphorylated in vitro by this phosphatase, the same amount of purified DEP-1 and PTPβ wild type catalytic domains were incubated with immunoprecipitated ERK2, after co-expression with a constitutively active SRC kinase in HEK293 cells. Although the two enzymes have the same activity on a generic synthetic substrate (Fig. 3A), only DEP-1 dephosphorylated ERK2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). These results taken together are consistent with DEP-1 phosphatase directly and specifically targeting the phosphorylated Tyr-204 in ERK1/2. Next we asked whether ERK1/2 dephosphorylation by DEP-1 could also occur in vivo. To this end, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with an HA-tagged construct directing the expression of full-length DEP-1 phosphatase. Similar transfections were carried out with mutant versions of DEP-1 carrying single substitutions in the catalytic site (D1205A or C1239S trapping mutants) or a deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain (ΔCy). The transfected cell cultures were stimulated for 5 min with EGF to induce ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4, wild type DEP-1 overexpression remarkably reduced Tyr-204 phosphorylation levels without affecting the activation of the upstream kinase MEK, as measured with antibody specific for the phosphorylation of the MEK activation loop. By contrast, the DEP-1 C1239S and ΔCy mutants did not affect ERK1/2 or MEK phosphorylation levels. Moreover, the overexpression of a third DEP-1 mutant carrying an Asp-1205 to Ala substitution (D/A trapping mutant) increased ERK1/2 kinase phosphorylation acting as a dominant negative effector. Presumably, the stable association between trapping mutant phosphatase and its substrate prevents ERK1/2 dephosphorylation by cellular wild type DEP-1 or other phosphatases. These results suggest that DEP-1 directly inactivates ERK1/2 in a RAS-MEK independent manner. Because DEP-1 is known to suppress the activity of various growth factor receptors by direct de-phosphorylation (11Kovalenko M. Denner K. Sandström J. Persson C. Gross S. Jandt E. Vilella R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 5728-5735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), we also analyzed the DEP-1/ERK1/2 interaction in a growth factor independent experimental system. To enhance ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the constitutively active mutant of SRC tyrosine kinase (Y527F) and with expression plasmids coding for wild type or substrate trapping mutants (C/S or D/A) of the DEP-1 phosphatase. As shown in Fig. 5A, DEP-1 overexpression resulted in a marked reduction of the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 proteins, whereas ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not affected by DEP-1 C/S, and it was remarkably increased by the DEP-1 D/A trapping mutant. The inactivation of ERK1/2 proteins in c-SRC-transfected cells was not observed upon TC-PTP overexpression (Fig. 5B) confirming the selective dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinases by DEP-1. To assess whether down-regulation of endogenous DEP-1 levels would have any effect on ERK1/2 activation, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with two interfering shRNA constructs targeting different sites on the phosphatase transcript. After 5 min of EGF induction, the decrease in DEP-1 expression was assessed by immunoblot (Fig. 6). Consistent with the observed decrease in activated ERK under conditions of DEP-1 overexpression, cells transfected with DEP-1 shRNA constructs showed a sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation when compared with cells transfected with a shRNA plasmid targeting an unrelated sequence. The fraction of activated MEK was comparable in the two conditions (Fig. 6). These results are consistent with the DEP-1 phosphatase directly targeting the ERK1/2 kinases. To explore whether ERK1/2 form a physical complex with DEP-1, HEK293 were transfected with HA-tagged DEP-1. After lysis and immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, phosphorylated ERK1/2 was found to associate strongly with the DEP-1 D/A trapping mutant and, to a much lesser extent, with the wild type and the C/S phosphatase mutant (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, some significant association was also observed with the wild type and D/A trapping mutant in conditions where ERK1/2 is not phosphorylated. By contrast GRB2, a second DEP-1 target predicted by our approach, only formed a complex with the D/A trapping mutant when the cells were stimulated with EGF. As shown in Fig. 7B, the interaction between DEP-1 and ERK1/2 can be detected at endogenous expression levels in HeLa cells, in the absence of EGF. Taken together these results are consistent with the presence of an ERK1/2 docking site in the intracellular domain of DEP-1. In the D/A trapping mutant this complex was stabilized by the synergic interaction of the inactive “trapping” catalytic domain with the target pho"
https://openalex.org/W2045121176,"The tumor suppressor p53 induces apo pto sis by altering the transcription of pro-apo pto tic targets in the nucleus and by a direct, nontranscriptional role at the mitochondria. Although the post-translational modifications regulating nuclear apo pto tic functions of p53 have been thoroughly characterized, little is known of how transcription-independent functions are controlled. We and others identified acetylation of the p53 DNA binding domain at lysine 120 as a critical event in apo pto sis induction. Although initial studies showed that Lys-120 acetylation plays a role in p53 function in the nucleus, we report here a role for Lys-120 acetylation in transcription-independent apo pto sis. We demonstrate that the Lys-120-acetylated isoform of p53 is enriched at mitochondria. The acetylation of Lys-120 does not appear to regulate the ability of p53 to interact with the pro-apo pto tic proteins BCL-XL and BAK. However, displacement of the inhibitory MCL-1 protein from BAK is compromised when Lys-120 acetylation is blocked. Functional studies show that mutation of Lys-120 to a nonacetylated residue, as occurs in human cancer, inhibits transcription-independent apo pto sis, and enforced acetylation of Lys-120 enhances transcription-independent apo pto sis. These data support a model whereby Lys-120 acetylation contributes to both the transcription-dependent and -independent apo pto tic pathways induced by p53. The tumor suppressor p53 induces apo pto sis by altering the transcription of pro-apo pto tic targets in the nucleus and by a direct, nontranscriptional role at the mitochondria. Although the post-translational modifications regulating nuclear apo pto tic functions of p53 have been thoroughly characterized, little is known of how transcription-independent functions are controlled. We and others identified acetylation of the p53 DNA binding domain at lysine 120 as a critical event in apo pto sis induction. Although initial studies showed that Lys-120 acetylation plays a role in p53 function in the nucleus, we report here a role for Lys-120 acetylation in transcription-independent apo pto sis. We demonstrate that the Lys-120-acetylated isoform of p53 is enriched at mitochondria. The acetylation of Lys-120 does not appear to regulate the ability of p53 to interact with the pro-apo pto tic proteins BCL-XL and BAK. However, displacement of the inhibitory MCL-1 protein from BAK is compromised when Lys-120 acetylation is blocked. Functional studies show that mutation of Lys-120 to a nonacetylated residue, as occurs in human cancer, inhibits transcription-independent apo pto sis, and enforced acetylation of Lys-120 enhances transcription-independent apo pto sis. These data support a model whereby Lys-120 acetylation contributes to both the transcription-dependent and -independent apo pto tic pathways induced by p53. The tumor suppressor p53 protects mammalian cells from malignant transformation by preventing the propagation of genetic aberrations required for tumorigenicity (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Genotoxic insults that cause DNA damage are among the major stimuli that threaten genomic integrity. In cells that are exposed to such insults, p53 can induce either a cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending in part on the severity of cellular damage incurred (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). To promote cell cycle arrest, p53 acts as a transcription factor to directly up-regulate the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF1/CDKN1 (2el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7936) Google Scholar), and other genes. In contrast, the maximal apoptotic response requires both transcription-dependent and -independent functions of p53 (3Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). For example, in response to excessive DNA damage, p53 directly activates the transcription of genes that promote apoptosis such as BAX, PUMA, NOXA, BAD, FAS, PERP, p53AIP1, and DRAM (reviewed in Ref. 4Kuribayashi K. El-Deiry W.S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 615: 201-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, following an apoptotic stimulus, a fraction of total cellular p53 localizes to mitochondria and directly induces cytochrome c release (5Erster S. Mihara M. Kim R.H. Petrenko O. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6728-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16202-16212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Part of the cytochrome c release is mediated by the ability of p53 to interact with and inhibit anti-apoptotic BCL-XL and BCL-2. These interactions promote the oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 9Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Additionally, mitochondrial p53 can interact with the pro-apoptotic BAK protein. Binding of p53 liberates BAK from the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, leading to BAK oligomerization (6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). The culmination of these events promotes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and subsequent cytochrome c release. The localization of p53 to the mitochondria is regulated by at least two different pathways. Recent evidence suggests that there is a population of p53 in the cytoplasm that is stabilized following DNA damage and subsequently shuttles to the mitochondria (11Marchenko N.D. Wolff S. Erster S. Becker K. Moll U.M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that MDM2-mediated mono-ubiquitylation of cytoplasmic p53 is essential for p53 to re-locate to the mitochondria. Once at the mitochondria p53 must be de-ubiquitylated by the ubiquitin hydrolase USP7/HAUSP to function in a pro-apoptotic manner. The mitochondrial localization of p53 is also influenced by a common polymorphism in p53 that influences MDM2 binding. Specifically the p53-R72 isoform displays both increased levels of mitochondrial p53 and increased apoptotic potential, compared with the p53-P72 isoform (12Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra 3rd, A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of the mitochondrial and nuclear functions of p53 to apoptosis remain unresolved. However, intriguing data suggest the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic functions of p53 are coupled to maximize apoptosis. Specifically, it has been found that the p53 target gene PUMA influences the fraction of anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members that interact with pro-apoptotic members, thereby controlling the threshold of efficacy of mitochondrial p53 (13Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In support of a model whereby the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic activities of p53 are coordinated, we report here that the form of p53 that is acetylated on Lys-120, and which has enhanced ability to activate pro-apoptotic target gene transcription, is also enriched at mitochondria. Loss of Lys-120 acetylation, such as occurs when this residue is mutated in human cancer, prevents transcription-independent apoptosis by p53. Mechanistically, acetylation of Lys-120 does not affect the localization or stability of mitochondrial or cytoplasmic p53. Furthermore, acetylation at Lys-120 is not required for p53 to interact with the apoptotic mediators BCL-XL and BAK. However, acetylation of Lys-120 is essential for p53 to effectively liberate the pro-apoptotic protein BAK from the oncoprotein MCL-1. These data elucidate a mechanism whereby the transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic functions of p53 are coordinated. pcDNA3-FLAG-hMOF was generated by PCR amplification and ligation into the pcDNA3.1-TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). pcDNA3-FLAG-p53 was a kind gift of K. Adler-Storthz. All p53-Lys-120 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Primer sequences are available upon request. The retroviral pBABE-puro-p53/ER construct was a kind gift of M. Schuler. H1299 cells, 293T, LNCaP, and MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Retroviral packaging plasmid (SVΨ-A-MLV) was described previously (14Sykes S.M.

The VirapowerTM T-RexTM lentiviral expression system was used to generate a p53 lentivirus expression vector (Invitrogen). For lentiviral packaging, 3 μg of each pLenti4-TO-p53 or pLenti6-TetR vector were co-transfected into 293T cells with the lentiviral packaging plasmids (2 μg of pCMV-ΔR8.2 and 1 μg of pCMV-VSV-G), and viral supernatants were collected, supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene, and added to target cells. Target H1299 cells were first engineered to express the tetracycline repressor protein, and H1299-TetR-expressing cells were subsequently infected with pLenti4-TO-p53 (or p53 mutants) recombinant lentiviruses and selected with 100 μg/ml Zeocin. To generate whole cell extracts, cells were lysed with a Nonidet P-40-based lysis buffer supplemented with 30 mm sodium butyrate and protease inhibitors. The following antibodies were used to detect protein expression by Western blot, p53 (FL-393G), actin (C-2), and p21 (C-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The PUMA antibody used was a kind gift of L. Zhang (University of Pittsburgh). For cell fractionation experiments, mitochondrial fractions were blotted with anti-p53 (FL-393G) and either anti-BAK-NT (Upstate) or anti-voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (Abcam). Cytosol was blotted with anti-p53 (FL-393G) and anti-tubulin (Sigma). Nuclear fractions were blotted with p53 (FL-393G), anti-hMOF antibody (where hMOF is the human ortholog of the Drosophila protein males absent of first, the kind gift of E. Smith and J.

Following lysis, 300–500 μg of protein lysate was aliquoted and incubated with 0.25 μg of acetyl-Lys-120 antibody or 1.0 μg of pan-acetyl-lysine antibody (Upstate). Antibody-bound protein complexes were then precipitated with protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Co-immunoprecipitation of p53 was performed using 0.5–1.0 μg of anti-BAK-NT (Upstate) or 0.5–1.0 μg of anti-BCL-XL (S-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Precipitates were then blotted with anti-p53 (FL-393G) or anti-MCL-1 (Abcam) to detect co-precipitation with BAK. The ApoAlertTM cell fractionation kit (BD Biosciences) was used to separate nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial cell fractions, according to manufacturer's instructions, with the modifications described in the supplemental material.

The p53 tumor suppressor has the ability to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). Although both of these processes require the transcriptional activities of p53, emerging evidence suggests that p53 also has transcription-independent functions that specifically contribute to its ability to induce apoptosis (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 10Chipuk J.E. Maurer U. Green D.R. Schuler M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transcription-dependent and -independent functions of p53 appear to be coupled to maximize apoptotic potential (13Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which p53 coordinates transcription-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways remains unresolved. Several post-translational modifications on p53 have been specifically associated with p53-mediated apoptosis. These include phosphorylation of serines 15, 20, and 46 as well as acetylation of lysines 373 and 382 (15Chao C. Herr D. Chun J. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2615-2622PubMed Google Scholar, 16Feng L. Hollstein M. Xu Y. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2812-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Knights C.D. Catania J. Di Giovanni S. Muratoglu S. Perez R. Swartzbeck A. Quong A.A. Zhang X. Beerman T. Pestell R.G. Avantaggiati M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although these modifications influence the transcriptional activities of p53, evidence suggests that these modifications are dispensable for p53 transcription-independent apoptosis (18Nemajerova A. Erster S. Moll U.M. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, mono-ubiquitylation of p53 at an unknown residue was recently shown to be important for transcription-independent apoptosis (11Marchenko N.D. Wolff S. Erster S. Becker K. Moll U.M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, acetylation of Lys-120 within the p53 DNA binding domain is also specifically required for p53-induced apoptosis (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, Lys-120 acetylation is necessary for p53 to activate the transcription of a subset of pro-apoptotic target genes, such as PUMA and BAX. Specifically, p53 acetylated at Lys-120 (AcLys-120-p53) specifically localizes to certain pro-apoptotic promoters (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). These observations prompted an examination of whether Lys-120 acetylation might also contribute to transcription-independent apoptosis by p53. To induce transcription-independent apoptosis, p53 localizes to the outer membrane of mitochondria (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 20Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. J. Clin. Immunol. 2003; 23: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the mitochondrial localization of AcLys-120-p53. A major regulatory step in the localization of p53 to mitochondria occurs at the level of nuclear export (12Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra 3rd, A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Therefore, cytoplasmic levels of p53 are a surrogate for the amount of p53 at the mitochondria (12Dumont P. Leu J.I. Della Pietra 3rd, A.C. George D.L. Murphy M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). As an initial test, both the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP were biochemically separated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Additionally, the nuclear fractions of each condition were biochemically separated into chromatin-bound and unbound fractions (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). Following fractionation, extracts from each cellular compartment were divided into aliquots assessed by immunoprecipitation for either lysine 120-acetylated p53 (AcLys-120-p53) or the total cohort of proteins containing acetylated lysines. To quantify p53 acetylation, these precipitates were then Western-blotted with antibodies that recognize all isoforms of p53. In both cell lines, a large portion (∼40% in MCF-7 and ∼30% in LNCaP) of AcLys-120-p53 was found in the chromatin-bound fraction. This observation is consistent with AcLys-120-p53 localizing to select pro-apoptotic promoters (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In comparison, both total Ac-p53 and overall p53 levels (∼70% each in MCF-7 cells) were present in the chromatin-bound fraction to a far greater extent than AcLys-120-p53 in both cell lines (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. 1). Analysis of cytoplasmic fractions from MCF-7 cells revealed that ∼45% of AcLys-120-p53 is localized in this compartment, whereas only ∼15% of Ac-p53 and ∼5% of total p53 are found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Similar observations were made in LNCaP cells (supplemental Fig. 1). To extend these observations, mitochondria were biochemically purified from cytoplasmic extracts of the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, and assessed for the presence AcLys-120-p53 as described above. Although between 4 and 6% of the total p53 population in the cell is acetylated at Lys-120, 24–40% of mitochondrial p53 is acetylated at Lys-120 (Fig. 1B). Also, consistent with the results observed in Fig. 1A, ∼20% of the total AcLys-120-p53 population in the cell is localized at the mitochondria, whereas ∼30 and 50% of AcLys-120-p53 are found in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, respectively (data not shown). Together these data show that AcLys-120-p53 is enriched at the mitochondria and that a significant fraction of mitochondrial p53 is acetylated at Lys-120. The mitochondrial function of p53 is partly controlled by the regulation of p53 transport to the mitochondria. Therefore, the tetracycline-regulated p53 expression system (TET-p53) was utilized to evaluate whether the Lys-120 acetylation influences the localization of p53 to the mitochondria. In this system apoptosis is induced by the combination of tetracycline to up-regulate p53 and a DNA-damaging agent, such as camptothecin (supplemental Fig. 2). H1299 cells expressing tetracycline-regulated p53 or p53(K120R) were either treated with tetracycline alone, camptothecin alone, or both. Mitochondria recovered from cells of each condition were subjected to Western blot to assess the levels of p53. Although tetracycline treatment alone leads to a small increase in p53 at the mitochondria, the combination of tetracycline and camptothecin strongly increases p53 at the mitochondria (Fig. 2A). It is important to note that eliminating Lys-120 acetylation did not affect the ability of p53 to localize to the mitochondria, indicating that Lys-120 acetylation is not required for p53 mitochondrial localization (Fig. 2A). As mutation of Lys-120 to arginine may mask the requirement for acetylation of this residue in mitochondrial localization of p53, we examined the ability of hMOF, which acetylates p53 on Lys-120, to influence mitochondrial localization of p53. In these studies, the acetyltransferase hMOF was transiently transfected into H1299 cells carrying the tetracycline-regulated p53 transgene. Cells transfected with hMOF or empty vector were treated with either tetracycline alone or in combination with the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin. Overexpression of hMOF in these cells substantially increased Lys-120 acetylation both in the presence and absence of adriamycin (Fig. 2B). However, ectopic expression of hMOF was unable to reproducibly increase steady-state levels of p53 protein at the mitochondria (Fig. 2C). Once at mitochondria, p53 can interact with BCL-2 family proteins. For example, p53 binds to the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2 and BCL-XL, leading to the liberation and oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 9Chipuk J.E. Kuwana T. Bouchier-Hayes L. Droin N.M. Newmeyer D.D. Schuler M. Green D.R. Science. 2004; 303: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 10Chipuk J.E. Maurer U. Green D.R. Schuler M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p53 directly interacts with and promotes oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic protein BAK (6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). All of these p53-BCL-2 family member interactions utilize the DNA binding domain of p53. Moreover, BAK directly binds to p53 within residues 92–160 of the p53 DNA binding domain. Therefore, the possibility that Lys-120 acetylation influences the binding to BAK or BCL-XL was tested. H1299 cells expressing tetracycline-regulated p53 or p53(K120R) were treated with either tetracycline alone, camptothecin alone, or both. Following treatment, cells were biochemically fractionated into crude cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. Crude cytoplasmic fractions were then separated into 2 aliquots. From each condition, 1 aliquot was subjected to IP with antisera raised against BAK, whereas the other aliquot was immunoprecipitated with BCL-XL antibodies. Following IP, anti-BAK and anti-BCL-XL precipitates were analyzed for the presence of p53 by Western blot. In cells treated with tetracycline alone, some p53 co-precipitated with both BAK and BCL-XL (Fig. 3). However, the amount of p53 bound to each protein was dramatically higher in cells treated with a combination of tetracycline and camptothecin (Fig. 3). Furthermore, both BAK and BCL-XL were able to associate quite well with p53 and p53(K120R), suggesting that Lys-120 acetylation is dispensable for the initial interaction of p53 with BAK or BCL-XL. At the mitochondria, p53 promotes BAK oligomerization by directly binding to BAK and displacing the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, which normally binds and inhibits BAK (6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that Lys-120 acetylation is dispensable for p53 to bind BAK, the requirement of Lys-120 acetylation for p53 to displace MCL-1 from BAK remained untested. H1299 cells expressing tetracycline-regulated p53 or p53(K120R) were treated with and without tetracycline. Following treatment cells were lysed and subjected to IP with antisera raised against BAK. IPs were subsequently blotted with antibodies that specifically recognize p53 or MCL-1. As reported previously, increased expression of p53 decreases the interaction between BAK and MCL-1 (Fig. 4A). However, when Lys-120 acetylation was abrogated, p53 showed decreased ability to dissociate MCL-1 from BAK (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the combination of tetracycline and adriamycin, which dramatically enhances p53-BAK interactions, was also insufficient for K120R to fully displace MCL-1 from BAK (Fig. 4B). In these anti-BAK precipitates, both p53 and MCL-1 were detected by Western blotting. This observation is consistent with the possibility that BAK, p53, and MCL-1 associate in a trimeric complex. Together, these data suggest that the acetylation of p53 at Lys-120 is important for transcription-independent apoptosis because of the role of this modification in regulating the disruption of the BAK-MCL-1 complex. A defect in MCL-1 displacement should lead to decreased levels of transcription-independent apoptosis. To formally evaluate whether Lys-120 acetylation contributes to induction of transcription-independent apoptosis by p53, the p53ER system was employed (10Chipuk J.E. Maurer U. Green D.R. Schuler M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Here full-length human p53 is fused to a modified version of the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor. When stably expressed in the p53 null human lung cancer line H1299, the p53ER protein is produced but remains inactive. Upon exposure to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), p53ER becomes active for gene transcription and apoptosis (Fig. 5A). To evaluate transcription-independent apoptosis, p53ER-expressing cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX) to block de novo protein translation (10Chipuk J.E. Maurer U. Green D.R. Schuler M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 371-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because p53ER is activated post-translationally, CHX treatment does not block p53ER expression or activity. However, p53 target genes transcribed are not translated, and any apoptotic effects of p53 here are thus independent of its transcriptional targets. As CHX is partially toxic to H1299 cells, it is difficult to directly compare the actual percentage of apoptosis between the CHX-treated and -untreated conditions. (Basal levels of apoptosis are ∼2% in the absence of CHX treatment but rise to 15% in the presence of CHX.) Therefore, we plotted p53-mediated apoptosis as the fold induction of apoptosis in response to p53 activation by 4-OHT treatment. Although the presence of CHX inhibits the production of p53 transcriptional targets (Fig. 5A, left panel), p53ER is still partially competent for inducing apoptosis (Fig. 5A, right panel) albeit to a lesser extent than transcriptionally competent p53ER. Although increased levels of PUMA are required for optimal p53-mediated apoptosis, there are sufficient basal levels of PUMA present in the cell that even when transcription of this p53 target is blocked, some apoptosis can proceed. This basal level of PUMA expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5, A and B). Our findings are consistent with those of other groups who demonstrated that transcription-independent apoptosis proceeds in the presence of basal PUMA levels, whereas a p53-mediated increase in the levels of PUMA is required for maximum apoptosis (7Mihara M.

As a test of the role of Lys-120 acetylation in this process, cells stably expressing mutant p53ER protein where Lys-120 has been converted to a nonacetylatable arginine (p53ER(K120R)) were evaluated for both p53 transcription-dependent and -independent apoptosis. As reported, loss of Lys-120 acetylation diminishes p53-mediated apoptosis in the absence of CHX (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol.

Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, p53ER(K120R) was also incapable of promoting transcription-independent apoptosis, consistent with acetylation at this site playing a role in this process (Fig. 5A, right panel). To ensure that this observation was not specific to the p53ER fusion protein, effects of Lys-120 acetylation on p53 transcription-independent apoptosis were also evaluated in a tetracycline-regulated system. H1299 expressing the tetracycline repressor protein and a transgene that expresses p53 under the regulation of a tetracycline-responsive element were generated. Here, levels of p53 are undetectable in the absence of tetracycline. Upon the application of tetracycline, p53 protein levels begin to increase by 2 h, and p53 target gene expression begins to increase at 4 h (data not shown). To assess p53 transcription-independent apoptosis, cells capable of expressing p53 or the p53(K120R) mutant were treated with tetracycline. Two hours following tetracycline or mock treatment, cells were treated with α-amanitin, which inhibits RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription and simultaneously promotes p53 transcription-independent apoptosis by providing a cellular stress signal (21Arima Y. Nitta M. Kuninaka S. Zhang D. Fujiwara T. Taya Y. Nakao M. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19166-19176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As expected, α-amanitin treatment suppressed the ability of p53 to up-regulate the expression of its target genes p21WAF1/CDKN1, MDM2, and PUMA (Fig. 5B, left panel). However, even in the absence of transcription, p53 still induced a substantial apoptotic response. As shown, activation of the transcription-independent response resulted in a 2-fold increase in apoptosis, with the total fraction of apoptotic cells reaching ∼10% (Fig. 5B, right panel). Consistent with results obtained using the p53ER system, p53(K120R) was unable to induce transcription-independent apoptosis in the presence of α-amanitin. The total fraction of apoptotic cells remained at ∼5% under these conditions, which is equivalent to the level observed for non-p53 expressing H1299 cells treated with α-amanitin. We and others have recently reported that loss of Lys-120 acetylation specifically diminishes p53-induced apoptosis but does not affect the ability of p53 to promote cell cycle arrest (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, H1299 cells lacking endogenous p53 and transiently transfected with either wild-type p53 or the K120R mutant display severe viability defects as assessed by colony formation assays (Fig. 6B). As the K120R mutant is defective for apoptosis but not growth arrest, the suppression of colony formation by this mutant reflects the growth arrest function of p53, whereas wild-type p53 induces both arrest and apoptosis. Fusion of the mitochondrial import signal from ornithine transcarbamylase to the amino terminus of the p53 protein (L-p53) leads to constitutive localization of p53 at mitochondria (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because L-p53 is excluded from the nucleus, it cannot induce either cell cycle arrest or transcription of pro-apoptotic target genes. Instead, the L-p53 allele can only suppress colony formation via transcription-independent apoptosis. Similar to previously published data (7Mihara M. Erster S. Zaika A. Petrenko O. Chittenden T. Pancoska P. Moll U.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar), we found that expression of L-p53 effectively suppresses colony formation (Fig. 6B). Remarkably, the L-K120R mutant exhibited reduced ability to suppress colony formation (Fig. 6B). This result was not because of differences in protein expression between experimental conditions, as confirmed by Western blotting. Quantitation of these data confirmed the defect in transcription-dependent apoptosis exhibited by the K120R mutant, a result that was consistently observed over the course of independent experiments (Fig. 6B, experiments 1 and 2). As the K120R mutant displayed only moderate defects in transcription-independent apoptosis, we reasoned that enforced Lys-120 acetylation might enhance transcription-independent apoptosis. To test this prediction, Lys-120 acetylation was increased by co-transfection of the acetyltransferase hMOF into H1299 cells along with mitochondria-targeted wild-type and K120R p53 expression vectors (Fig. 6C). As demonstrated by increased colony growth suppression when L-p53 was expressed with hMOF, transcription-independent apoptosis was enhanced by increased Lys-120 acetylation (Fig. 6C). This effect of hMOF was in large part related to its ability to acetylate Lys-120, because co-expression of hMOF was substantially less efficient at enhancing transcription-independent apoptosis by the K120R mutant. Quantitation of these results over the course of independent experiments confirmed these observations (Fig. 6C). Combined, both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies support a model in which Lys-120 acetylation is important for p53 transcription-independent apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis is a central tumor suppressor function of the p53 protein. It has become clear in recent years that maximal apoptosis requires both nuclear and mitochondrial functions of p53 (13Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Although the ability of p53 to regulate the transcription of pro-apoptotic targets within the nucleus has been intensely studied, comparatively little is known about how the mitochondrial function of p53 is regulated. We and others have recently reported that acetylation of Lys-120 within the DNA binding domain of p53 is critical for its pro-apoptotic function in the nucleus (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). As shown in this study, blocking Lys-120 acetylation by conservative mutation to arginine also blocks transcription-independent apoptosis by p53. Although somewhat rare, lysine to arginine mutations at Lys-120 have been identified in human cancer (22Hashimoto T. Tokuchi Y. Hayashi M. Kobayashi Y. Nishida K. Hayashi S. Ishikawa Y. Tsuchiya S. Nakagawa K. Hayashi J. Tsuchiya E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5572-5577PubMed Google Scholar, 23Meyers F.J. Chi S.G. Fishman J.R. deVere White R.W. Gumerlock P.H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1856-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This study also reports our efforts at defining the precise biochemical event regulated by Lys-120 acetylation during transcription-independent apoptosis. Although the Lys-120-acetylated isoform of p53 is highly enriched at the mitochondria after DNA damage, our data suggest that this modification is not required for directing p53 to this organelle. Similarly, acetylation of Lys-120 is not required for the interaction of p53 with the BCL-2 family members BCL-XL or BAK. However, subsequent analysis has demonstrated that Lys-120 acetylation is required for efficient displacement of the MCL-1 protein from BAK by p53. This displacement event is critical for the induction of transcription-independent apoptosis by p53 (6Leu J.I. Dumont P. Hafey M. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), presumably because it facilitates BAK oligomerization and permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The results reported here raise several interesting questions about how p53 acetylation at Lys-120 might enhance displacement of MCL-1 from BAK. For example, it is possible that acetylation of Lys-120 causes a conformational change in p53 that disrupts the otherwise stable trimeric complex of p53, BAK, and MCL-1. Most structural information available for p53 suggests that Lys-120 resides in a flexible domain termed the L1 loop (24Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 25Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Upon acetylation, this loop may become more rigid or acquire new steric attributes that allow it to block the MCL-1 interface on BAK. The fact that we observe no acetylation-induced change in the ability of p53 to bind BAK itself suggests that it is the displacement event that is directly affected, rather than the ability of p53 to target the BAK/MCL-1 dimer. Future efforts will include the detailed structural analysis required to fully understand the role of Lys-120 acetylation in disruption of the BAK-MCL-1 interaction. It has recently been reported that the de-ubiquitylation of an unknown lysine plays an important role in activating p53 function at the mitochondria (11Marchenko N.D. Wolff S. Erster S. Becker K. Moll U.M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It is possible that Lys-120 acetylation is important for transcription-independent apoptosis because it directly or indirectly participates in controlling the ubiquitylation status of this unknown residue. In fact, Lys-120 can be ubiquitylated (26Chan W.M. Mak M.C. Fung T.K. Lau A. Siu W.Y. Poon R.Y. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and it is thus tempting to speculate that acetylation at this residue enhances p53 function by blocking ubiquitylation of the same lysine. An intriguing extension of the results reported here relates to the use of therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating mutant forms of p53 in human cancer. Many of the common cancer-causing mutations in p53 debilitate its nuclear function by eliminating DNA binding capability (24Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar, 25Kitayner M. Rozenberg H. Kessler N. Rabinovich D. Shaulov L. Haran T.E. Shakked Z. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that many tumor-derived mutants of p53 constitutively localize to mitochondria but are somehow impaired for apoptotic function (27Erster S. Moll U.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that relieving this block might be a beneficial therapeutic strategy in some human tumors (28Galluzzi L. Morselli E. Kepp O. Tajeddine N. Kroemer G. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1949-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Results such as those reported here will be important for the rational design of these strategies. Previous studies by us and others have shown that Lys-120 acetylation is critical for the nuclear, transcription-dependent apoptotic function of p53 (14Sykes S.M. Mellert H.S. Holbert M.A. Li K. Marmorstein R. Lane W.S. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 19Tang Y. Luo J. Zhang W. Gu W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). We report here that Lys-120 acetylation also plays an important role in activating the mitochondrial, transcription-independent function of p53. Ultimately these data suggest a model in which Lys-120 acetylation coordinates the activation of the two critical pro-apoptotic pathways downstream of p53. We thank H. Mellert and A.

https://openalex.org/W2103993315,"Background The fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of illness and death in persons with predisposing factors, including: malignancies, solid organ transplants, and corticosteroid use. C. neoformans is ubiquitous in the environment and enters into the lungs via inhalation, where it can disseminate through the bloodstream and penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in a difficult to treat and often-fatal infection of the brain, called meningoencephalitis. Plasminogen is a highly abundant protein found in the plasma component of blood and is necessary for the degradation of fibrin, collagen, and other structural components of tissues. This fibrinolytic system is utilized by cancer cells during metastasis and several pathogenic species of bacteria have been found to manipulate the host plasminogen system to facilitate invasion of tissues during infection by modifying the activation of this process through the binding of plasminogen at their surface. Methodology The invasion of the brain and the central nervous system by penetration of the protective blood-brain barrier is a prerequisite to the establishment of meningoencephalitis by the opportunistic fungal pathogen C. neoformans. In this study, we examined the ability of C. neoformans to subvert the host plasminogen system to facilitate tissue barrier invasion. Through a combination of biochemical, cell biology, and proteomic approaches, we have shown that C. neoformans utilizes the host plasminogen system to cross tissue barriers, providing support for the hypothesis that plasminogen-binding may contribute to the invasion of the blood-brain barrier by penetration of the brain endothelial cells and underlying matrix. In addition, we have identified the cell wall-associated proteins that serve as plasminogen receptors and characterized both the plasminogen-binding and plasmin-activation potential for this significant human pathogen. Conclusions The results of this study provide evidence for the cooperative role of multiple virulence determinants in C. neoformans pathogenesis and suggest new avenues for the development of anti-infective agents in the prevention of fungal tissue invasion."

Efforts at identifying factors that attract and recruit ATMs have mostly focused on the CC chemokine MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and its receptor CCR2. These studies have led to contradicting results with several publications showing that MCP-1 and CCR2 are important for ATM recruitment and the subsequent development of IR (3Kanda H. Tateya S.

Furthermore, the studies that claim a role for MCP-1 and CCR2 in ATM recruitment and IR show that deficiency of the ligand or the receptor did not result in normalization of ATM content, indicating that other factors also participate in ATM recruitment. These findings suggest that the precise role of the MCP-1/CCR2 axis in ATM recruitment and IR is unclear, and that other chemokines and their receptors could also play a role in these processes. One such chemokine is interleukin 8 (IL-8), the prototypical CXC chemokine known to recruit and activate monocytes and to attract polymorphonuclear leukocytes to sites of inflammation (9Remick D.G. Crit. Care Med. 2005; 33: S466-S467Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). IL-8 is elevated in plasma of obese subjects (10Straczkowski M. Dzienis-Straczkowska S. Stêpieñ A. Kowalska I.

Scherbaum W.A. Martin S. Kolb H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: S11-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Additionally, IL-8 is implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, two obesity-associated disorders (15Boisvert W.A. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. Immunol. Res. 2000; 21: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Finally, IL-8 is an angiogenic factor, and angiogenesis is a hallmark of AT expansion in obesity (16Trayhurn P. Wood I.S. Br. J. Nutr. 2004; 92: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). Although these findings suggest an important role for IL-8 in AT biology and pathology, little is known regarding the mechanism of regulation of IL-8 in obesity and its role in AT biology and pathology. This is probably due, in part, to the absence of suitable animal models because mice and rats do not have a clear-cut IL-8 ortholog (17Modi W.S. Yoshimura T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1999; 16: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although rodent keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) shows the highest homology with human growth-related oncogene (GRO-α), it appears to be the closest equivalent to IL-8, as judged by its pattern of expression and putative function (18Watanabe K. Iida M. Takaishi K. Suzuki T. Hamada Y. Iizuka Y. Tsurufuji S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Monocytes express the KC receptor (CXCR2), and KC triggers monocyte arrest on early atherosclerotic endothelium, one of the first steps in the invasion of tissues by macrophages (19Huo Y. Weber C. Forlow S.B. Sperandio M. Thatte J. Mack M. Jung S. Littman D.R. Ley K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interaction of monocyte CXCR2 with its ligand KC leads to up-regulation of α4β1 integrin affinity and firm adhesion to the endothelium (19Huo Y. Weber C. Forlow S.B. Sperandio M. Thatte J. Mack M. Jung S. Littman D.R. Ley K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both KC and its receptor play a central role in macrophage infiltration and accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions in mice (20Boisvert W.A. Santiago R. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. J.

However, no information is currently available regarding the role of KC in macrophage recruitment in obese AT or its role in AT biology and pathology. In this study, we show that KC expression is elevated in AT and plasma of genetically (ob/ob) and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, probably as the result of increased leptin and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels associated with obesity. We also show that obesity-induced KC is mostly derived from nonadipocyte sources in AT and that KC does not affect adipocyte differentiation but does increase pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in adipocytes. Finally, we show in a DIO model in chimeric mice lacking CXCR2 on their macrophages that the KC receptor plays an important role in macrophage accumulation in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue and subsequent development of IR. Animal studies were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Animal Research Committee, in accordance with Public Health Policy regarding the use and care of laboratory animals. Genetically obese mice deficient for leptin (C57BL/6J-Lepob; ob/ob), their respective lean counterparts (C57BL/6J WT), and CXCR2-deficient mice (C.129S2(B6)-Il8rbtm1MwmJ) and their appropriate WT controls (Balb/cJ) were from The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME. The p55−/−, p75−/−, and p55p75−/− mice were kindly provided by G. S Hotamisligil (Harvard School of Public Health). In some experiments, C57BL/6J WT mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 μg of recombinant murine TNF-α (Genzyme Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA) or 10 μg of leptin (R & D Systems). Control animals were injected with 100 μl of saline. Three hours later, AT was removed and processed for the preparation of total RNA. For the DIO model, C57BL/6J (8-week-old) male or bone marrow transplanted male mice (see below) were placed for 16 weeks on HFD (D12492, 60% fat, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ). AT digestion and cell fractionation, bone marrow transplantations, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed as described previously (22Lumeng C.N. Bodzin J.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin.

These cells were cultured and differentiated into adipocytes as described previously (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In some experiments, total RNA and conditioned media were harvested from the differentiating cells at different time points to measure KC mRNA and protein expression, respectively. In other experiments, cells were treated with saline (control) or KC (10 or 100 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) either initially before starting the differentiation process (at pre-confluent and confluent stage) or chronically throughout the whole differentiation process, where KC was added every 3 days when culture media were changed, beginning at the pre-confluent stage. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells were fixed by incubation with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 20 min and stained with Oil Red O as described previously (25Ding S.T. McNeel R.L. Mersmann H.J.

The dye was extracted from the cells with isopropyl alcohol, and the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 510 nm. For gene expression studies, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes (day 11) were treated either with saline (control) or KC (10 or 100 ng/ml) for 24 h before harvesting total RNA. F4/80 immunohistochemistry was carried out on 6-μm deparaffinized sections of mouse fat pads. Details are available as supplemental material. Adipocyte diameters were measured using the SPOT software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc). Five microscopic photographs were taken from the AT sections of each mouse. Adipocyte diameters were measured from three random fields (25 cells/field) from each photograph. Crown-like structures were quantified as described previously (23Solinas G. Vilcu C. Neels J.G. Bandyopadhyay G.K. Luo J.L. Naugler W. Grivennikov S. Wynshaw-Boris A. Scadeng M. Olefsky J.M. Karin M. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Details are available as supplemental material. Concentrations of KC in plasma and conditioned cell culture medium were determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Quantikine, R & D Systems). Statistical significance between two groups was determined by the Student's t test. Comparisons among several groups were performed by analysis of variance, and statistical significance was calculated using the Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Although KC is the functional analog of human IL-8, which is increased in human obesity (10Straczkowski M. Dzienis-Straczkowska S. Stêpieñ A. Kowalska I. Szelachowska M. Kinalska I. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 4602-4606Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 11Kim C.S. Park H.S. Kawada T. Kim J.H. Lim D. Hubbard N.E. Kwon B.S. Erickson K.L. Yu R. Int. J. Obes. 2006; 30: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), no information is available regarding the expression of KC in obese mice. We therefore measured KC expression in lean, genetically obese (ob/ob), and DIO mice (Fig. 1). KC mRNA levels in epididymal AT from the genetically obese ob/ob and DIO mice are 5- and 9-fold higher, respectively (Fig. 1A), when compared with their lean counterparts. In parallel, KC antigen in the plasma was elevated by 1.8-fold in ob/ob and 2.1-fold in DIO mice (Fig. 1B). Because obesity is associated with hyperleptinemia and elevated levels of TNF-α (26Eckel R.H. Grundy S.M. Zimmet P.Z. Lancet. 2005; 365: 1415-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4993) Google Scholar), we determined whether either TNF-α or leptin regulates the expression of KC in vivo. Lean mice, injected with TNF-α or leptin, showed an increase in AT KC mRNA levels by 21- or 25-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). The regulatory effect of leptin on KC expression is also apparent from Fig. 1, A and B; even though the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have a higher body weight (58.1 ± 2.5 g) than the DIO mice (48.6 ± 3.6 g), KC mRNA and protein levels are less pronounced, confirming a role for leptin in KC regulation. However, the same data show that leptin is only partially responsible for the increased KC expression in obese mice, as is evidenced by the KC increase that remains in the leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. To further assess the contribution of TNF-α to the observed increase in KC expression, we analyzed adipose tissue KC mRNA levels in wild-type and TNF-α receptor-deficient (p55−/−, p75−/−, and p55p75−/−) lean mice, injected with either saline or TNF-α. Fig. 1D shows that TNF-α injection results in an induction of KC mRNA levels in adipose tissue of wild-type and p75−/− mice, but not in p55−/− and p55p75−/− mice, confirming that TNF-α is a major inducer of KC expression in adipose tissue and that the p55 TNF-α receptor is crucial for this induction. Together, these results show that AT KC mRNA expression and plasma levels of KC are significantly increased in both genetically and diet-induced obese mice, probably as the result of the high levels of leptin and TNF-α associated with obesity. Next, we investigated the cellular sources responsible for KC expression in obese and lean AT. Cell fractionation experiments were performed to determine relative KC mRNA levels in both adipocyte and stromal vascular (SV) fractions of AT from lean and obese (ob/ob) mice. As shown in Fig. 2A, KC mRNA levels were similar in both adipocytes and SV cells from lean AT, suggesting that both fractions are sources of KC. However, in ob/ob mice, although KC expression in the adipocyte fraction was similar to that observed for lean adipocytes, its expression in the SV fraction was significantly increased compared with lean mice. This suggests that the increase in KC in the AT of obese mice is primarily due to increased expression from cells within the SV fraction and not from adipocytes. The AT SV fraction consists of multiple cell types (e.g. endothelial cells, fibroblasts, preadipocytes, and macrophages) (27Schäffler A. Schölmerich J. Buechler C. Nat. Clin. Pract. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 3: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To analyze the expression of KC in preadipocytes and during adipocyte differentiation, we studied an in vitro model of adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 cells. KC gene expression was high in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (day 0), and this expression decreased during adipocyte differentiation, to a level in mature adipocytes (day 11) that was ∼500-fold lower than in preadipocytes (Fig. 2B). A parallel decrease was observed in KC protein expression in conditioned media from differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 2C). For example, preadipocytes (day 0) express 145 pg/ml/day, and this decreased to 26 pg/ml/day in mature adipocytes (day 11). Together, these in vitro results show that KC is highly expressed in preadipocytes and decreases during adipogenesis. Several studies have shown that the expression of cytokines/chemokines, including IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1, decreases during adipogenesis, similar to what we observe for KC (Fig. 2, B and C). These cytokines/chemokines inhibit adipocyte differentiation (28Gerhardt C.C. Romero I.A. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 29Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 30Xing H. Northrop J.P. Grove J.R. Kilpatrick K.E. Su J.L. Ringold G.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2776-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Ohsumi J. Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi J. Miyadai K. Yoshioka S. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Serizawa N. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2279-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that KC may also inhibit adipogenesis. We therefore analyzed the effect of exogenous KC on 3T3-L1 differentiation. Neither initial (acute, 1 day) nor chronic treatment (i.e. 11 days) of 3T3-L1 cells with 10 or 100 ng/ml KC inhibited adipogenesis as revealed by the lack of difference in the appearance and extent of Oil Red O staining and quantification of lipid accumulation of the differentiated cells (Fig. 3). Although KC does not seem to affect adipogenesis (Fig. 3), and its expression is not increased in adipocytes in obese AT (Fig. 2A), we hypothesized that increased KC in obese AT by SV cells (e.g. preadipocytes) could affect the expression of inflammatory genes in neighboring adipocytes. As shown in Fig. 4, KC treatment of adipocytes (10 or 100 ng/ml for 24 h) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in expression of the inflammatory adipokines leptin, MCP-1, IL-6, and TNF-α but no change in the adipokines PAI-1 resistin and adiponectin. Interestingly, KC also induced the expression of SOCS3, a well established mediator of insulin resistance (32Howard J.K. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the obesity-induced increase in AT KC expression may contribute to adipose inflammation via the induction of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in adipocytes. These changes together with increased SOCS3 expression may ultimately lead to the development of insulin resistance. Because both KC and its receptor play a central role in macrophage infiltration and accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions in mice (20Boisvert W.A. Santiago R. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 21Boisvert W.A. Rose D.M. Johnson K.A. Fuentes M.E. Lira S.A. Curtiss L.K. Terkeltaub R.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1385-1395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the KC/CXCR2 axis could play an important role in adipose tissue macrophage infiltration associated with obesity. We therefore studied chimeric mice deficient in the KC receptor CXCR2 in their bone marrow (BM) and, as a result, in all BM-derived cells (e.g. macrophages). Animals that received wild-type BM were used as a control group. Half of the animals of each group received a normal chow (NC) diet (10% fat) and the other half a HFD (60% fat). Mice fed the HFD gained more weight than the NC control group; this was not influenced by the BM genotype. After 8 weeks of diet, body weight of control WT BMT mice was 34.8 ± 0.6 g at HFD versus 28.1 ± 1.0 g at NC (p < 0.001, mean ± S.E., n = 5). The body weights of CXCR2−/− BMT mice were 35.1 ± 0.4 g at HFD versus 28.3 ± 1.3 at NC (p < 0.001, mean ± S.E., n = 5). Average weekly food intake was stable throughout the study in both NC and HFD groups and was not different between BM genotypes (data not shown). No significant differences were observed between the different groups when comparing the white blood cell count and differential (supplemental Table I). AT sections stained for the macrophage marker F4/80 indicated that less macrophages infiltrated the AT of the HFD-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice compared with HFD-fed WT BMT mice (Fig. 5, A and B). We obtained similar results when staining for MAC2 (data not shown). Macrophages were rarely observed in AT from the lean NC-fed mice (data not shown). The infiltrated macrophages formed crown-like structures around presumably dead adipocytes as described previously (Fig. 5A, inset) (33Strissel K.J. Stancheva Z. Miyoshi H. Perfield 2nd, J.W. DeFuria J. Jick Z. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2910-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Quantification of the adipocyte diameters as a measure of adipocyte size showed a 20–30% increase in adipocyte size in HFD- versus NC-fed mice but no differences between genotypes (Fig. 5C). Quantification of the number of crown-like structures per field as a measure of macrophage infiltration of the AT showed a 66% reduction in the HFD-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 5D). We and others have shown previously that obesity is also associated with increased macrophage content in skeletal muscle (34Hevener A.L. Olefsky J.M. Reichart D. Nguyen M.T. Bandyopadyhay G. Leung H.Y. Watt M.J. Benner C. Febbraio M.A. Nguyen A.K. Folian B. Subramaniam S. Gonzalez F.J. Glass C.K. Ricote M. J. Clin.

Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 301-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured muscle mRNA levels of the macrophage marker CD68. As shown in Fig. 5E, the expression of this marker is 3-fold lower in HFD-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice compared with their WT counterparts. Because liver contains its own specialized resident macrophages (i.e. Kupffer cells), we analyzed whether the lack of CXCR2 on BM-derived cells affected macrophage content in the liver. As shown in Fig. 5F, CD68 expression levels in livers of HFD-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice did not differ from that of their WT counterparts. Together, these results demonstrate that although the lack of the KC receptor CXCR2 on BM-derived cells has no effect on weight gain and adipocyte size in a DIO mouse model, it results in a dramatic reduction of macrophage infiltration of obese adipose and muscle tissue, confirming a role for the KC/CXCR2 nexus in macrophage infiltration. As it has now been well established that macrophage recruitment and proinflammatory activation are required for the development of IR in obese mice (1Pradhan A. Nutr. Rev. 2007; 65: S152-S156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed insulin and glucose tolerance tests to evaluate the insulin sensitivity in both WT and CXCR2−/− BMT mice fed either NC or HFD. Fasting glucose levels increased with HFD in WT BMT mice (171.6 ± 5.3 mg/dl in HFD-fed versus 141.0 ± 7.2 mg/dl in NC-fed, p < 0.05, mean ± S.E., n = 5) but not in CXCR2−/− BMT mice (146.1 ± 11.1 mg/dl in HFD-fed versus 147.5 ± 5.6 mg/dl in NC-fed, mean ± S.E., n = 5). Furthermore, fasting insulin levels increased with HFD in both WT and CXCR2−/− BMT mice (3.85 ± 0.61 μg/liter in HFD-fed versus 1.64 ± 0.18 μg/liter in NC-fed WT BMT mice and 3.02 ± 0.77 μg/liter in HFD-fed versus 1.07 ± 0.30 μg/liter in NC-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice, p < 0.05, mean ± S.E., n = 5), but there were no significant differences between BM genotypes. As shown in Fig. 6A, injection of insulin in NC-fed mice resulted in a similar drop in blood glucose levels regardless of BM genotype. However, HFD-fed WT BMT mice were less responsive to insulin and only showed a slight drop in blood glucose level. In contrast, the HFD-fed CXCR2−/− BMT mice behaved like the NC-fed mice and showed a large drop in blood glucose levels after insulin administration. We also performed a glucose tolerance test (GTT) and made similar observations (Fig. 6B). HFD-induced obesity led to glucose intolerance in WT BMT mice, whereas CXCR2−/− BMT mice were partially protected. Finally, the glucose-induced insulin secretion during the GTT was increased by high fat feeding, but no significant differences were observed between BM genotypes (Fig. 6C). Together, these results indicate that CXCR2−/− BMT mice are partially protected against HFD-induced IR. The present study provides novel information on the expression and regulation of KC in AT of obese mice, and it demonstrates a potential role for KC and its receptor CXCR2 in the inflammation, macrophage recruitment, and insulin resistance associated with obesity. Our studies demonstrating elevated KC expression in AT and plasma of obese mice are consistent with what has been reported for IL-8 expression in human obesity (38Bruun J.M. Lihn A.S. Madan A.K. Pedersen S.B. Schiøtt K.M. Fain J.N. Richelsen B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Elevated KC in AT of obese mice appeared to be derived primarily from stromal/vascular cells, likely to be preadipocytes and/or invading macrophages, again consistent with IL-8 expression in human obesity (38Bruun J.M. Lihn A.S. Madan A.K. Pedersen S.B. Schiøtt K.M. Fain J.N. Richelsen B. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 286: E8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In obese individuals the AT becomes the largest endocrine organ, and adipose-derived proteins have systemic effects on other organs (2de Luca C. Olefsky J.M. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Thus, increased adipose KC expression may contribute both to local inflammation and to systemic increase in KC and therefore may also contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis associated with obesity. Bone marrow transplantation from CXCR2-deficient mice demonstrates that the lack of CXCR2 on bone marrow-derived cells results in a dramatic reduction of obese adipose and muscle tissue macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, the lack of CXCR2 on bone marrow transplanted cells also resulted in significant protection against HFD-induced IR, thereby identifying a crucial role for this chemokine receptor not only in the inflammation but also the subsequent manifestation of IR in obesity. It should be noted that CXCR2 affinity is associated with the presence of a conserved Glu-Leu-Arg (ELR) motif in chemokines (39Addison C.L. Daniel T.O. Burdick M.D. Liu H. Ehlert J.E. Xue Y.Y. Buechi L. Walz A. Richmond A. Strieter R.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5269-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Thus, absence of CXCR2 will not only disrupt KC signaling but also the other ELR+ members of the CXC chemokine family. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the in vivo effects observed in the CXCR2−/− BMT mice are because of disruption of signaling through multiple chemokines and not just KC alone. While this manuscript was undergoing revisions, Chavey et al. (40Chavey C. Lazennec G. Lagarrigue S. Clapé C. Iankova I. Teyssier J. Annicotte J.S. Schmidt J. Mataki C. Yamamoto H. Sanches R. Guma A. Stich V. Vitkova M. Jardin-Watelet B. Renard E. Strieter R. Tuthill A. Hotamisligil G.S. Vidal-Puig A. Zorzano A. Langin D. Fajas L. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) published a study showing that like KC another ligand of CXCR2, called CXCL5, is also expressed in white adipose tissue, is increased in obesity, and is regulated by TNF-α. Based on immunoselective isolation of cell fractions, they suggest that the major contributors of CXCL5 in adipose tissue are macrophages present in the stromal vascular fraction. However, the use of IL-6 and MCP-1 as specific markers for macrophages in the selection process is misleading because these proteins are also highly expressed in preadipocytes (29Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 41Harkins J.M. Moustaid-Moussa N. Chung Y.J. Penner K.M. Pestka J.J. North C.M. Claycombe K.J. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2673-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relative contribution of macrophages and preadipocytes to both CXCL5 and KC expression by the stromal vascular fraction deserves further study. Similar to our observations of protection from insulin resistance in CXCR2−/− BMT mice, Chavey et al. (40Chavey C. Lazennec G. Lagarrigue S. Clapé C. Iankova I. Teyssier J. Annicotte J.S. Schmidt J. Mataki C. Yamamoto H. Sanches R. Guma A. Stich V. Vitkova M. Jardin-Watelet B. Renard E. Strieter R. Tuthill A. Hotamisligil G.S. Vidal-Puig A. Zorzano A. Langin D. Fajas L. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) show that whole-body CXCR2 knock-out mice are also protected against obesity-induced IR. Although we did not observe any significant differences in fasting insulin levels between BM genotypes, Chavey et al. (40Chavey C. Lazennec G. Lagarrigue S. Clapé C. Iankova I. Teyssier J. Annicotte J.S. Schmidt J. Mataki C. Yamamoto H. Sanches R. Guma A. Stich V. Vitkova M. Jardin-Watelet B. Renard E. Strieter R. Tuthill A. Hotamisligil G.S. Vidal-Puig A. Zorzano A. Langin D. Fajas L. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) noted an unexpected increase in fasting insulin levels in their whole-body CXCR2−/− mice. This suggests that the systemic genetic deletion of CXCR2 could also affect other pathways, and it may be that the observed increase in insulin sensitivity merely reflects the higher insulin levels in these whole-body knock-outs. Chavey et al. (40Chavey C. Lazennec G. Lagarrigue S. Clapé C. Iankova I. Teyssier J. Annicotte J.S. Schmidt J. Mataki C. Yamamoto H. Sanches R. Guma A. Stich V. Vitkova M. Jardin-Watelet B. Renard E.

Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggest that increased CXCL5 expression by adipose tissue directly promotes IR by negative modulation of the insulin signaling pathway through binding to the CXCR2 receptor in distant muscle cells. However, we also observed protection against obesity-induced IR in our CXCR2−/− BMT mice, and these animals are only deficient for the receptor in their bone marrow-derived cells (e.g. macrophages), but still have an intact CXCR2 receptor on their muscle cells. Based on these data, we would therefore argue that the protection for obesity-induced IR in CXCR2−/− mice is not related to the observation that CXCL5 treatment causes IR in muscle cells, but more likely to the known role of CXCR2 and its ligands in inflammation, as is evidenced by our data on adipose and muscle tissue macrophage infiltration in CXCR2−/− BMT mice. Increasing evidence suggest that the SOCS family of proteins play central mechanistic roles in the development of insulin resistance. SOCS3 binds the insulin receptor and prevent its binding to insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), thus inhibiting IRS-1 phosphorylation and downstream insulin signaling (32Howard J.K. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). SOCS3 also inhibits insulin signaling by targeting both IRS-1 and IRS-2 for proteosomal degradation (32Howard J.K. Flier J.S. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Our studies showing that KC can directly induce SOCS3 expression in adipocytes provides an additional mechanistic link by which the KC/CXCR2 axis may lead to insulin resistance in the setting of obesity. While preparing this manuscript, a study was published showing that neutrophils transiently infiltrate intra-abdominal adipose tissue early in the course of high fat feeding (42Elgazar-Carmon V. Rudich A. Hadad N. Levy R. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1894-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Between days 3 and 7 after commencing high fat feeding, neutrophils were present within the parenchyma of the adipose tissue in-between adipocytes but were absent at later time points (42Elgazar-Carmon V. Rudich A. Hadad N. Levy R. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1894-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because KC is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (43Kobayashi Y. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 26: 307-316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not unlikely that KC and CXCR2 play an important role in this transient neutrophil infiltration of adipose tissue. However, because we did not harvest tissues at such early time points during the high fat feeding of our CXCR2−/− BMT mice, we could not draw any conclusions regarding a potential role for CXCR2 in this transient neutrophil infiltration. This will be a subject of future investigations. Several independent studies have demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) and chemokines (e.g. MCP-1, MIP-1α, and IL-8) can inhibit adipogenesis by blocking stem cell commitment and differentiation as well as induce dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes (28Gerhardt C.C. Romero I.A. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A.D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 29Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2279-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, in our study, KC did not affect adipogenesis nor did it induce dedifferentiation of mature adipocytes as determined by Oil Red O staining, and by the demonstration that KC treatment did not change the expression of the adipogenesis markers adipsin and lipoprotein lipase (data not shown). Similarly, CXCL5 also did not affect adipogenesis (40Chavey C. Lazennec G. Lagarrigue S. Clapé C. Iankova I. Teyssier J. Annicotte J.S. Schmidt J. Mataki C. Yamamoto H. Sanches R. Guma A. Stich V. Vitkova M. Jardin-Watelet B. Renard E. Strieter R. Tuthill A. Hotamisligil G.S. Vidal-Puig A. Zorzano A. Langin D. Fajas L. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 339-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, KC and CXCL5 appear to be unique with respect to their effects on adipogenesis. The mechanistic nature of this difference warrants further investigation. In summary, this study demonstrates that expression of the chemokine KC, the functional IL-8 analog in rodents, is increased in plasma and adipose tissue of obese mice and that one or more cell types in the stromal vascular cell population in the adipose tissues (i.e. nonadipocytes) are responsible for this increased expression. We show that KC can induce the expression of inflammatory factors and SOCS3 in adipocytes and that the absence of its receptor CXCR2 on bone marrow-derived cells leads to a reduction of macrophage infiltration of obese adipose and muscle tissue and protection from obesity-induced insulin resistance. These studies suggest that KC and its receptor CXCR2 are potential targets for the development of new therapeutic approaches for treatment of obesity-related insulin resistance and type II diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2093675450,"Background The production of staphylocoagulase (SC) causing the plasma coagulation is one of the important characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus. Although SCs have been classified into 10 serotypes based on the differences in the antigenicity, genetic bases for their diversities and relatedness to chromosome types are poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We compared the nucleotide sequences of 105 SC genes (coa), 59 of which were determined in this study. D1 regions, which contain prothrombin-activating and -binding domains and are presumed to be the binding site of each type-specific antiserum, were classified into twelve clusters having more than 90% nucleotide identities, resulting to create two novel SC types, XI and XII, in addition to extant 10 types. Nine of the twelve SC types were further subdivided into subtypes based on the differences of the D2 or the central regions. The phylogenetical relations of the D1 regions did not correlate exactly with either one of agr types and multilocus sequence types (STs). In addition, genetic analysis showed that recombination events have occurred in and around coa. So far tested, STs of 126 S. aureus strains correspond to the combination of SC type and agr type except for the cases of CC1 and CC8, which contained two and three different SC types, respectively. Conclusion The data suggested that the evolution of coa was not monophyletic in the species. Chromosomal recombination had occurred at coa and agr loci, resulting in the carriage of the combinations of allotypically different important virulence determinants in staphylococcal chromosome."

A chimeric protein, mNectarine fused to the N terminus of hCNT3 (mNect.hCNT3), enabled measurement of pH at the intracellular surface of hCNT3. mNectarine fluorescence was monitored in HEK293 cells expressing mNect.hCNT3 or mNect.hCNT3-F563C, an inactive hCNT3 mutant. Free cytosolic mNect, mNect.hCNT3, and the traditional pH-sensitive dye, BCECF, reported cytosolic pH similarly in pH-clamped HEK293 cells. Cells were incubated at the permissive pH for H(+)-coupled nucleoside transport, pH 5.5, under both Na(+)-free and Na(+)-containing conditions. In mNect.hCNT3-expressing cells (but not under negative control conditions) the rate of acidification increased in media containing 0.5 mm uridine, providing the first direct evidence for H(+)-coupled uridine transport. At pH 5.5, there was no significant difference in uridine transport rates (coupled H+ flux) in the presence or absence of Na+ (1.09 +/- 0.11 or 1.18 +/- 0.32 mm min(-1), respectively). This suggests that in acidic Na(+)-containing conditions, 1 Na+ and 1 H+ are transported per uridine molecule, while in acidic Na(+)-free conditions, 1 H+ alone is transported/uridine. In acid environments, including renal proximal tubule, H+/nucleoside co-transport may drive nucleoside accumulation by hCNT3. Fusion of mNect to hCNT3 provided a simple, self-referencing, and effective way to monitor nucleoside transport, suggesting an approach that may have applications in assays of transport activity of other H(+)-coupled transport proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2017950916,"The potential regulation of protein trafficking by calmodulin (CaM) is a novel concept that remains to be substantiated. We proposed that KCNQ2 K+ channel trafficking is regulated by CaM binding to the C-terminal A and B helices. Here we show that the L339R mutation in helix A, which is linked to human benign neonatal convulsions, perturbs CaM binding to KCNQ2 channels and prevents their correct trafficking to the plasma membrane. We used glutathione S-transferase fused to helices A and B to examine the impact of this and other mutations in helix A (I340A, I340E, A343D, and R353G) on the interaction with CaM. The process appears to require at least two steps; the first involves the transient association of CaM with KCNQ2, and in the second, the complex adopts an “active” conformation that is more stable and is that which confers the capacity to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Significantly, the mutations that we have analyzed mainly affect the stability of the active configuration of the complex, whereas Ca2+ alone appears to affect the initial binding step. The spectrum of responses from this collection of mutants revealed a strong correlation between adopting the active conformation and channel trafficking in mammalian cells. These data are entirely consistent with the concept that CaM bound to KCNQ2 acts as a Ca2+ sensor, conferring Ca2+ dependence to the trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane and fully explaining the requirement of CaM binding for KCNQ2 function.

M-type channels are generated by the KCNQ (Kv7) family of voltage-gated subtypes (1Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar), and they are found throughout the nervous system where they fulfill dominant roles in the control of excitability and neural discharges (2Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Like all Kv channels, the KCNQ α subunits share a common core structure of six transmembrane segments with a voltage sensing domain (S1–S4) and a pore domain (S5 and S6; see Fig. 1) (3Haitin Y. Attali B. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1803-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts the presence of four helical regions (A–D) in all family members (4Yus-Nájera E.

CaM is a prototypical Ca2+ sensor that confers Ca2+ sensitivity to a wide array of proteins, including ion channels (5Saimi Y. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). CaM is thought to mediate Ca2+-dependent inhibition of KCNQ channels (6Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and in addition, we have postulated that a direct association with CaM is required for KCNQ2 channels to exit the endoplasmic reticulum (7Etxeberria A. Aivar P. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Alaimo A. Villacé P. Gómez-Posada J.C. Areso P. Villarroel A.

To gain a deeper understanding into the involvement of CaM in channel trafficking, we have studied this interaction in vitro with a set of CaM-binding site-specific mutants. Although we had previously explored the impact of some of these mutants on channel trafficking (7Etxeberria A. Aivar P. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Alaimo A. Villacé P. Gómez-Posada J.C. Areso P. Villarroel A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), here we have extended this study to the mutant L339R located in helix A. This mutation, as well as the R353G mutation in helix A, has been linked to benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC), a human epileptic syndrome of newborn children (2Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the impact of these mutations on the adoption of an “active” conformation by CaM and channel subunit exit from the ER, lending further support to the concept that CaM is a critical regulator for the exit of the channel from the ER. The human KCNQ2 (Y15065) and KCNQ3 (NM004519) cDNAs were kindly provided by T. J. Jentsch (Leibniz-Institut für Molekulare Pharmakologie, Berlin, Germany), and all of the deletions, point mutations, and epitope insertions in KCNQ subunits were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis. The cDNAs encoding the rat CaM and the Ca2+-independent form of CaM (CaM1234), in which the first aspartate of each EF hand is replaced by alanine, were provided by the group of J. P. Adelman (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). For immunoprecipitation experiments, the KCNQ2 subunit was tagged at the N terminus with a tandem repeat of five Myc epitopes (MEQKLISEEDLN), whereas the KCNQ3 subunit was tagged with a tandem repeat of two HA epitopes (YPYDVPDYA). All of the constructs were subcloned into pCAGGS (provided by J. C. de la Torre, The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA). For imaging, KCNQ2 was tagged at the N terminus with mCFP in pSRC5, a low copy number vector, and CaM was tagged at the N terminus with YFP and cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The electrophysiological properties recorded in Xenopus oocytes of tagged KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 constructs were indistinguishable from those of the nontagged equivalents. The Tac-CFP construct was generated using the Tac receptor provided by Dr. Steve Standley (Laboratory of Neurochemistry, NIDCD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), which was cloned into a modified version of the expression vector pEGFP (Clontech) where the eGFP has been exchanged by mCFP. The ER marker pDsRed2-ER was obtained from Clontech. The Gly310–Leu548 region of KCNQ2 (WT and the I340E, I340A, A343D, L339R, and R353G mutants), neurogranin (amino acids 1–78, NP006167), and the C terminus of the NR1a NMDA receptor (amino acids 818–922; NP015566) were subcloned into the pGEX-3X GST fusion vector (Pharmacia). The expression of these fusion proteins in transformed BL21 DE3 bacteria was induced with 0.3 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of chilled GST buffer that included protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton, 2 mm dithiothreitol, plus half tablet of protease inhibitor mixture; 1× Complete; Roche Applied Science). The resuspended pellet was sonicated at 4 °C and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm (80,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C with a TFT 50.38 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Finally, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, whereas the insoluble cell lysate (inclusion bodies) was treated separately. The initial experiments were performed with proteins purified from the soluble fraction to assure that they were properly folded. In latter experiments, the fusion proteins were solubilized from inclusion bodies with 6 m urea and then refolded. The results obtained with these proteins were indistinguishable from the soluble material. The insoluble cell lysates (inclusion bodies) isolated by centrifugation were suspended three times in 10 ml of the same buffer used for sonication, and they were centrifuged to remove any remaining soluble material. The precipitate was dissolved for 30 min at 4 °C in 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m urea (pH 7.4), mixing occasionally. The solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The diluted supernatant was centrifuged, and the new supernatant was dialyzed for 14 h against 2 liters of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 m urea, pH 7.4, and for 10 h against the same buffer without urea. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford method. Dispersion of the samples was evaluated by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd.) to exclude the presence of aggregates. The correlation function and the polydispersity index (less than 0.2) demonstrated that the proteins were monodispersed, and no aggregates were found. Recombinant rat brain calmodulin was produced in BL21 DE3 bacteria, purified, and dansylated as described (4Yus-Nájera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, CaM (100 μl at 10 mg/ml) was diluted 10-fold in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 8.5. Dansyl chloride dissolved in acetone (2.17 mg/ml) was added (12.5 μl) to a final concentration of 100 μm, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 h, vortexing every 20 min. Unincorporated dansyl was eliminated using a 1-ml G-25 Sepharose column. EGTA was added to dansyl-calmodulin (D-CaM) to a final concentration of 500 mm to facilitate the elimination of Ca2+. D-CaM and GST-KCNQ2 fusion proteins were dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) for 48 h, changing the buffer every 10–12 h. The levels of contaminant Ca2+ in the D-CaM preparations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy at the Department of Analytical Chemistry (University of the Basque Country), and they were found to be less than 40 nm. The concentration of D-CaM used was 12.5 nm. The fluorescence emission spectrum was obtained with an Aminco Bowman series 2 (SLM Aminco) fluorescence spectrophotometer in a final volume of 1 ml or 100 μl (using quartz cuvette) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was 340 nm, and emissions were registered from 400 to 660 nm. For the titration experiment, increasing concentrations of each GST' protein were added to a cuvette containing D-CaM alone (in the presence of EGTA 10 mm) or in the presence of excess of calcium (by adding 5.1 mm Ca2+ to give a concentration of 1.6 μm free Ca2+) in D-CaM binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). The primary antibodies used were: mouse polyclonal anti-Myc (9E10; a gift of Dr. Sebastian Pons, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas de Barcelona, Spain); rat monoclonal anti-HA (3F10; Roche Applied Science); mouse monoclonal anti-CaM (Upstate Biotechnology); rabbit anti-cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (Upstate Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (clones 7.1 and 13.1; Roche Applied Science); or a mouse monoclonal anti-α tubulin (DM1A; Sigma). The peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies used were raised against mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), rat IgG, or rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch). Standard two-electrode voltage clamp procedures were employed to record currents from Xenopus oocytes (8Etxeberria A. Santana-Castro I. Regalado M.P. Aivar P. Villarroel A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9146-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Three days after mRNA injection, whole cell currents were recorded in oocytes at room temperature (∼22 °C) using a virtual ground two-electrode voltage clamp Geneclamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Borosilicate electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of ∼1 MΩ. The oocytes were continuously perfused with Xenopus saline containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The data were acquired at a sampling rate of 1 KHz and filtered at 100 Hz; voltage step protocols, and current analyses were performed with pCLAMP 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). The current values represent the averages (±S.E.) of the maximal conductance obtained from the fit of the γ-V relationship to a Boltzmann equation,γ=Gmax/[1+exp((V1/2-Vm)/slope)](Eq. 1) where Gmax = Imax/(Vstep − Vrev), Imax is the maximal current, Vrev is the reversal potential (−87.3 ± 0.34 mV, in our recording conditions; n = 387), γ is the tail current amplitude in a 800-ms voltage step to −20 mV (Vstep) elicited after 800-ms depolarizing voltage pulses from −120 to +50 mV in 10 mV increments (Vm) evoked every 20 s, and V½ is the membrane potential at which the current is half of Imax. To obtain the absolute amplitude, the tail current values were subtracted from the amplitude of the tail current preceded by a voltage step to −120 mV. The Gmax value was normalized to the averaged Gmax obtained the same day using five or more oocytes expressing KCNQ2/KCNQ3 heteromers. The data were normalized in Excel and plotted in Sigmaplot. A KCNQ3 subunit tagged with an HA epitope in the extracellular loop connecting transmembrane domains S1 and S2 was used for the single oocyte chemiluminescent assay (8Etxeberria A. Santana-Castro I. Regalado M.P. Aivar P. Villarroel A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9146-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using a calcium phosphate protocol, and the constructs expressed were analyzed 24–36 h after transfection. One day after transfection, HEK293T cells were solubilized for 30 min at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors (1× Complete; Roche Applied Science). The nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 3 min, and the insoluble material was removed after centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The lysates were precleared with 40 μl of equilibrated protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma P3391) for 1 h at 4 °C. Anti-Myc antibodies were immobilized with 40 μl of equilibrated protein A beads overnight at 4 °C and washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer. Precleared lysates were incubated with protein A-anti-Myc for 4 h at 4 °C, and after four washes with immunoprecipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were released by heating at 90 °C 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The chimeric Tac-AB-CFP protein was constructed by ligating a KCNQ2 fragment containing the CaM-binding domain (from amino acids Gly310 to Leu548) previously amplified by PCR into the Tac-CFP plasmid. HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 1 μg of DNA/M6 well, and expression of the fusion proteins was analyzed 36 h after transfection. The cells were removed from the plates, pelleted by centrifugation, lysed with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled before analyzing by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (A4503; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an anti-GFP primary antibody diluted 1:1,000 (Roche Applied Science) that was visualized with a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated to peroxidase diluted 1:5,000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20. The HEK293T cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline for 24 h after transfection using calcium phosphate, and they were then fixed in freshly diluted 3.5% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 min. Co-localization experiments were performed using a Nikon TE2000-U microscope (Melville, NY) equipped for epifluorescence and with a Nikon D-eclipse C1 Si confocal spectral detector, using a 60×, 1.45 numerical aperture, oil immersion objective. The fluorescent proteins were excited using a 437-nm laser line, and 32 images were acquired simultaneously at different emission wavelengths between 450 and 610 nm at 5-nm intervals. For each cell, ten optical sections (approximately 0.6 μm thick) were acquired using a 30-μm-diameter pinhole, and cells with similar levels of expression (as judged by their brightness) were selected for analysis. The signal from each fluorophore was isolated by performing spectral unmixing with EZ C1 3.00 software (Nikon). The reference spectra were acquired from cells expressing mCFP-KCNQ2, pDsRed2-ER, or YFP-tagged constructs alone. Each image was analyzed for co-localization using ImageJ software (version WCIF; National Institutes of Health), using the plug-in to calculate the Manders' coefficient (9Manders E.M. Stap J. Brakenhoff G.J. van Driel R. Aten J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 857-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The images were converted to 8-bits, the background was automatically subtracted, and both the brightness and contrast were adjusted. The perimeter of the cell was drawn manually for analysis. The induction of conformational changes to 12.5 nm D-CaM was studied in vitro using GST fusion proteins containing helices A and B of KCNQ2 (GST-Q2AB; FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). The impact of several mutations in helix A of KCNQ2 was examined, including two that cause BFNC in humans (L339R and R353G) (10Moulard B. Picard F. le Hellard S. Agulhon C. Weiland S. Favre I. Bertrand S. Malafosse A. Bertrand D. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2001; 36: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Richards M.C. Heron S.E. Spendlove H.E. Scheffer I.E. Grinton B. Berkovic S.F. Mulley J.C. Davy A. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Virtually no difference in fluorescence was observed when the interaction between D-CaM and the reference A343D and I340E mutants was assayed, although the two mutants linked to BFNC and the I340A mutant produced a moderate effect on the maximal fluorescence emission (Fig. 2 and Table 1). These results indicate that CaM adopted at least three configurations in the absence of Ca2+: free CaM, CaM-Q2AB, and CaM-Q2AB*. These results may be explained if the transition rate from free-CaM to CaM-Q2AB depends on the concentration of Q2AB, whereas the complex CaM-Q2AB undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement to adopt the active configuration CaM-Q2AB*, which displays stronger fluorescent emission. In this simple model, the intramolecular transition from CaM-Q2AB to CaM-Q2AB* does not depend on the concentration of the Q2AB protein.FIGURE 2Mutations in helix A of the KCNQ2 binding site affect the maximal D-CaM fluorescence emission. A, emission spectra of 12.5 nm D-CaM in the presence of 1.6 μm free Ca2+ (dotted lines) and in the absence of Ca2+ (solid lines; 10 mm EGTA added), as well as in the presence (bold traces) and absence (light traces) of the GST-Q2AB fusion protein (200 nm).

Open table in a new tab The results indicated that the main consequence of the mutations was a destabilization of the active CaM-Q2AB* conformation. Nevertheless, the relative maximal changes in fluorescent emission were similar in the presence and absence of Ca2+ for all the proteins tested (Table 1). Thus, Ca2+ had little influence on the intramolecular transitions to and from the Ca2+-CaM-Q2AB* conformation, but rather it affected the binding of the peptide (i.e. the first transition), causing a change in the EC50 (note that Ca2+-CaM-Q2AB* and CaM-Q2AB* represent different conformations of the complex). This model predicts that binding to CaM can take place even if it does not lead to an active configuration being adopted (that causes an enhancement in D-CaM fluorescence emission). We devised a competition assay to test this prediction for the A343D mutant, which barely produces an effect on D-CaM (Table 1). The basis of this assay is that the A343D mutant may displace D-CaM bound to a target peptide, leading to a reduction in fluorescence. We used two unrelated CaM target proteins as reporters of the interaction in the presence (NR1a) or absence (neurogranin) of Ca2+ (4Yus-Nájera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A complex of D-CaM (12.5 nm) with the C terminus of the NR1a receptor fused to GST was established in the presence of 1.6 μm free Ca2+, and the effects of introducing 50 nm of the mutant protein were assessed. To make the assay more sensitive, we chose to use the concentration of GST-NR1a that produced 50% of the effect, and hence, 8.75 nm of GST-NR1a was used. To test for competition in the absence of Ca2+, GST fused to neurogranin was used because only a weak signal was obtained with GST-NR1a under these conditions. The concentration of GST-neurogranin that caused 50% enhancement in D-CaM fluorescence was found to be 30 nm. These experiments showed that the mutant displaced D-CaM from the wild type binding site (Fig. 3), both in the presence and the absence of Ca2+. Thus, the results obtained with the A343D presented in Figs. 2B and 3 are consistent with the existence of an “inactive” CaM-peptide intermediate. Having an array of mutants that covers a wide range of responses provided us with the opportunity to ask how the in vitro behavior of D-CaM correlates with the proposed role of CaM in channel trafficking. To answer this question, we first characterized the BFNC-causing L339R mutant. To compare this mutant with the data reported for the other mutants (7Etxeberria A. Aivar P. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Alaimo A. Villacé P. Gómez-Posada J.C. Areso P. Villarroel A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we subjected L339R to a battery of assays, including electrophysiology, co-immunoprecipitation, surface expression, and co-localization with an ER marker (Fig. 4). When expressed in heterologous systems, homomeric KCNQ2 subunits yield very small currents. However, both the current and their surface expression increase when KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are co-expressed in a manner that is dependent on the heteromerization of the intracellular C-terminal region (8Etxeberria A. Santana-Castro I. Regalado M.P. Aivar P. Villarroel A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9146-9152Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 12Schwake M. Pusch M. Kharkovets T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13343-13348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, to be able to compare the data with that published previously, we assessed the functional consequences of this mutation when co-expressed with KCNQ3 subunits in Xenopus oocytes, resulting in a >80% reduction in the current and surface expression (Fig. 4A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the amount of CaM associated with KCNQ2-L339R was diminished in both homomeric KCNQ2 (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S1) and heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels (Fig. 4C). To monitor the intracellular distribution of the channels, the subunits were tagged at the N terminus with the blue emitting fluorescent protein mCFP, and they were co-expressed in HEK293T cells with a red emitting fluorescent ER marker. To compare the extent of co-localization quantitatively, 32 confocal images were acquired simultaneously at different wavelengths and subjected to spectral unmixing (to separate the emission of one fluorophore from another), followed by a pixel to pixel comparison of the mCFP and dsRed images (9Manders E.M. Stap J. Brakenhoff G.J. van Driel R. Aten J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 857-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CaM was overexpressed with the intention of obtaining the maximal CaM mediated effect, whereas in another set of experiments, a CaM mutant unable to bind Ca2+ (CaM1234) was overexpressed to assess the role of this cation. We have previously assessed the extent to which the WT channel and the I340A and R353G mutants co-localize (7Etxeberria A. Aivar P. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Alaimo A. Villacé P. Gómez-Posada J.C. Areso P. Villarroel A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The data from these mutants and from the L339R mutant were collected and plotted against the increase in D-CaM fluorescence. This analysis demonstrated a remarkable correlation between the extent of ER co-localization and D-CaM fluorescence emission (Fig. 5), suggesting that adopting the active CaM-Q2AB* and Ca2+-CaM-Q2AB* configurations are rate-limiting for homomeric KCNQ2 channels to exit the ER. In addition, more co-localization (i.e. greater retention in the ER) was evident for all of the mutants when CaM1234 was overexpressed, maintaining a linear correlation (Fig. 5) and suggesting that Ca2+ binding facilitates exit from the ER. To study the entry into the Golgi apparatus, helices A and B were fused at the intracellular C terminus of the single transmembrane protein, the interleukin-2 receptor α subunit (Tac). Tac harbors two N-glycosylation sites that are processed in the Golgi apparatus, thereby producing more complex forms with substantial differences in molecular weight (13Bonifacino J.S. Suzuki C.K. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 247: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In addition, when monitoring the transit to the Golgi compartment, the use of the Tac reporter protein simplifies the interpretation of the results because this protein is monomeric, and therefore the results obtained are independent of the possible impact of subunit assembly. When helices AB from KCNQ2 were attached after the transmembrane domain of a Tac-CFP chimera, a high molecular weight band that corresponded to the mature glycosylated protein was observed. The extent of glycosylation was quantified as described previously (7Etxeberria A. Aivar P. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Alaimo A. Villacé P. Gómez-Posada J.C. Areso P. Villarroel A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and the correlation between D-CaM fluorescence emission and the mature glycosylation of the different constructs was again remarkable. However, in contrast to the clear effect of the complete channel on ER co-localization, there was no significant impact of CaM1234 overexpression on the glycosylation of the Tac-Q2AB mutants. A small but significant reduction (22%) was only detected for the wild type Tac-Q2AB protein. These contrasting results suggested that the Ca2+-dependent regulation of CaM-mediated ER exit may depend on the context in which the helices AB reside. That is, the helices may confer greater Ca2+ dependence to the channel subunit than to the Tac protein. The relationship between D-CaM fluorescent emission and surface expression or ionic current from heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels expressed in oocytes showed that small reductions in D-CaM fluorescence emission corresponded to a large reduction in the number of functional channels (Fig. 5C). The interpolation of the data using a hyperbolic transfer function revealed that a 20% reduction in maximal D-CaM fluorescence translated into a 50% reduction in the number of channels at the plasma membrane. Conversely, an 80% reduction in the number of channels corresponded to halving the maximal D-CaM emission. The in vitro behavior of the recombinant KCNQ2 CaM-binding site corresponds beautifully with the ER retention observed with the complete channel expressed in a mammalian cell line. Thus, the intrinsic properties of the CaM-KCNQ2 interaction appear to govern the exit from the ER of homomeric KCNQ2 channels. These data imply that CaM binding is a requisite for ER exit but that binding is not sufficient for this event to occur. For instance, the A343D mutant binds CaM, but it does not reach the plasma membrane. The key to this process is the adoption of a novel active conformation that stabilizes the complex. Indeed, the BFNC mutants L339R and R353G and the remaining helix A mutants destabilize this active configuration. There are contrasting reports on the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction with KCNQ channels; although it has been suggested that such interactions are independent of Ca2+, there is also evidence that the interaction is stronger in the presence or the absence of Ca2+ (4Yus-Nájera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Bal M. Zaika O. Martin P. Shapiro M.S. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2307-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This apparent controversy is at least in part likely to reflect the inherent limitations of the different methods used to study the association of KCNQ channels with CaM. To clarify this important issue, we have studied the interaction in vitro using a robust and sensitive fluorescent assay under conditions that provide tight control of the free Ca2+ concentration. Our results clearly show that Ca2+ destabilizes the interaction of the KCNQ2-binding site with CaM. As a consequence, Ca2+ binding to CaM is weaker when CaM is complexed to the KCNQ channel binding site. Strong Ca2+ dependence was recently suggested for the interaction between CaM and KCNQ2 channels in living cells, and a robust interaction with CaM1234 was demonstrated, indicating that the interaction between KCNQ2 and CaM is likely to have Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent components (15Bal M. Zaika O. Martin P. Shapiro M.S. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 2307-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We show here that ER retention is increased by heterologous expression of CaM1234, which presumably displaces endogenous CaM and makes the complex Ca2+ insensitive. This is entirely consistent with the hypothesis that CaM bound to the channel acts as a Ca2+ sensor, conferring Ca2+ dependence to the trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane and fully explaining the requirement of CaM binding for KCNQ2/3 function. Future experiments will address the influence of intracellular Ca2+ levels on surface expression and ER retention. Our results are in sharp contrast with those suggesting that CaM binding is not required for mouse KCNQ2 subunits to traffic to the membrane (14Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of murine KCNQ2 has two insertions when compared with the human subunit used in the present study, one of 10 amino acids (exon 8) and another one of 18 amino acids (exon 11), which may account for the differences observed. This opens the intriguing possibility that alternative splicing could influence how CaM regulates channel trafficking. On the other hand, the evidence currently available does not indicate whether CaM must remain bound when the channel reaches the plasma membrane for the channel to be functional. Hence, the concept that CaM is an auxiliary subunit of KCNQ2/3 channels (14Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7991-8001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) should perhaps be treated with certain reservation until more convincing evidence is presented. CaM regulates the trafficking of SK K+ channels by affecting the assembly of subunits (16Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37980-37985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee W.S. Ngo-Anh T.J. Bruening-Wright A. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25940-25946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For KCNQ2, a different mechanism applies because the impact of helices AB on trafficking can be transplanted to a monomeric protein, indicating that this regulation does not require subunit assembly. This is not to say that assembly has no influence on the CaM-mediated regulation of trafficking. The reduced effect of CaM1234 on Tac-Q2AB trafficking indicates that the full Ca2+-dependent response is modulated by other regions of the channel. In other words, the impact of CaM on trafficking mediated by helix AB depends primarily on CaM binding and then on its subsequent “activation.” Thus, other regions of the channel may assist in the transduction of the Ca2+-dependent rearrangement into a more efficient exit from the ER. The relationship between D-CaM fluorescent emission and ionic current or surface expression of heteromeric KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels expressed in oocytes was not linear. This was expected for two reasons. On the one hand, the KCNQ3 subunit can bind CaM, such that there are at least two intact CaM-binding sites available in the heterotetramers. On the other hand, heteromerization causes an increase in surface expression that is dependent on the assembly domain formed by helices C and D (3Haitin Y. Attali B. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 1803-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Schwake M. Athanasiadu D. Beimgraben C. Blanz J. Beck C. Jentsch T.J. Saftig P. Friedrich T. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is important to note that small changes in adopting the active configuration translate into a large reduction in the number of functional channels at the plasma membrane. Thus, the effect of CaM appears to be amplified by other processes, and any regulation on the efficiency to adopt the active conformations will have a profound effect on the M-current. We have summarized our current hypothesis regarding CaM regulation of KCNQ2 trafficking in Fig. 6. In the absence of Ca2+, CaM binds transiently to helices A and B of KCNQ2, which undergoes a conformational change that stabilizes the complex and that partly conceals retention/retrieval signals, thereby facilitating the translocation of the channel to the plasma membrane. Ca2+ binding triggers a rearrangement of CaM that masks additional retention/retrieval signals that may be present in other regions of the channel. In the monomeric Tac protein, these additional retention signals may not be present or are not functional, and the conformational change triggered by Ca2+ barely improves ER exit.

https://openalex.org/W2036234771,"Spiroplasma is widespread as a heritable bacterial symbiont in insects and some other invertebrates, in which it sometimes acts as a male-killer and causes female-biased sex ratios in hosts. Besides Wolbachia, it is the only heritable bacterium known from Drosophila, having been found in 16 of over 200 Drosophila species screened, based on samples of one or few individuals per species. To assess the extent to which Spiroplasma infection varies within and among species of Drosophila, intensive sampling consisting of 50–281 individuals per species was conducted for natural populations of 19 Drosophila species. Infection rates varied among species and among populations of the same species, and 12 of 19 species tested negative for all individuals. Spiroplasma infection never was fixed, and the highest infection rates were 60% in certain populations of D. hydei and 85% in certain populations of D. mojavensis. In infected species, infection rates were similar for males and females, indicating that these Spiroplasma infections do not confer a strong male-killing effect. These findings suggest that Spiroplasma has other effects on hosts that allow it to persist, and that environmental or host variation affects transmission or persistence leading to differences among populations in infection frequencies."

It is amongst the most mutagenic lesions in cells because of its dual coding potential, wherein 8-oxoG(syn) can pair with an A in addition to normal base pairing of 8-oxoG(anti) with a C. Human DNA polymerase kappa (Polkappa) is a member of the newly discovered Y-family of DNA polymerases that possess the ability to replicate through DNA lesions. To understand the basis of Polkappa's preference for insertion of an A opposite 8-oxoG lesion, we have solved the structure of Polkappa in ternary complex with a template-primer presenting 8-oxoG in the active site and with dATP as the incoming nucleotide.We show that the Polkappa active site is well-adapted to accommodate 8-oxoG in the syn conformation. That is, the polymerase and the bound template-primer are almost identical in their conformations to that in the ternary complex with undamaged DNA. There is no steric hindrance to accommodating 8-oxoG in the syn conformation for Hoogsteen base-paring with incoming dATP.The structure we present here is the first for a eukaryotic translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase with an 8-oxoG:A base pair in the active site. The structure shows why Polkappa is more efficient at inserting an A opposite the 8-oxoG lesion than a C. The structure also provides a basis for why Polkappa is more efficient at inserting an A opposite the lesion than other Y-family DNA polymerases."

Here, we investigated the mechanism of TGFβ-mediated Bim expression in two hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apo pto sis with TGFβ, AML-12 and Hep3B. We show that TGFβ induces Bim protein and mRNA levels, and its expression is sufficient to induce cell death. Gene array results revealed that Runx1, a member of the Runx family of transcription factors, was induced by TGFβ, and this induction was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, TGFβ specifically induced the expression of Runx1 protein from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent, cap-independent, mRNA transcript, and its overexpression was sufficient to induce hepatocyte apo pto sis. Deletion and mutation analyses of the murine Bim promoter identified a putative forkhead binding element, at position −174 to −168 from the transcription start site, as the mediator of Runx1 induction. Co-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that Runx1 does not bind directly to the identified forkhead binding element but rather binds the transcriptional regulator FOXO3, which occupies this site. Finally, small interfering RNA knockdown of Runx1 or FOXO3 decreased TGFβ-induced Bim expression. Our results support a mechanism in which TGFβ stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating Runx1 expression, which binds FOXO3, and the two cooperate in the transcriptional induction of Bim.

In the FAO rat hepatoma cell line, TGFβ induces the caspase-dependent cleavage of Bad in a Smad3-dependent manner to produce a more potent, truncated Bad species (14Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We first demonstrated that TGFβ induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) through a Smad3-dependent mechanism to induce cell death in B-lymphocytes (15Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This induction of Bim has more recently been demonstrated in gastric epithelial cells undergoing TGFβ-induced apoptosis (16Ohgushi M. Kuroki S. Fukamachi H. O'Reilly L.A. Kuida K. Strasser A. Yonehara S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10017-10028Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and confirmed in AML12 hepatocytes and NMuMG mammary epithelial cells (17Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Bim is a member of the BH3-only family of pro-apoptotic proteins that also includes Bid, Bad, Bmf, Noxa, and Puma (18Strasser A. Nat. Rev.

These proteins share only the single BH3 domain, which allows heterodimerization with other Bcl-2 family members. Following a pro-apoptotic stimulus, Bim initiates the mitochondrial cell death pathway by either directly activating Bax-like proteins (direct activation model) or by binding to pro-survival Bcl-2 family members and thereby releasing Bax-like proteins (indirect activation model) (19Adams J.M. Cory S. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1324-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar, 20Galonek H.L. Hardwick J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1317-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Bim proteins are expressed by a wide variety of tissues but are most prominently expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin and have been shown to be critical for apoptosis in B- and T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes (18Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Experiments using Bim knock-out mice indicate that Bim is required for B-cell receptor- induced apoptosis in immature and mature B-cells and for the negative selection of autoreactive B-cells (18Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Although there is no reported hepatic phenotype in Bim knock-out mice (21Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C.

The pro-apoptotic activity of Bim is highly regulated by pro-survival and pro-apoptotic cytokines through both post-translational and transcriptional mechanisms. Studies on the post-translational control of Bim have demonstrated that Bim is phosphorylated by ERK, leading to its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (25Ewings K.E. Wiggins C.M. Cook S.J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 26Hübner A. Barrett T. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, we have recently demonstrated that TGFβ/Smad3 signaling induces the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP4 (MKP2) to inhibit ERK activity, thereby stabilizing Bim and promoting apoptosis (27Ramesh S. Qi X.J. Wildey G.M. Robinson J. Molkentin J. Letterio J. Howe P.H. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Studies on the transcriptional control of Bim have focused largely on FOXO3, a member of the forkhead family of transcriptional regulators, which directly stimulates Bim transcription (28Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 29Cai B. Xia Z. Apoptosis. 2008; 13: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Multiple reports have shown that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is a negative regulator of FOXO3-stimulated Bim transcription via phosphorylation of FOXO3, leading to the binding and sequestration of this transcription factor by cytosolic 14-3-3 proteins (30Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 73: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 31Fu Z. Tindall D.J. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2312-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The prominent role of Bim as a mediator of apoptosis is gaining in importance. Thus, an understanding of how Bim expression is regulated under various physiological and pathological conditions is of significance. There are relatively few studies that directly address the transcriptional regulation of Bim. Herein, we examined the mechanism through which TGFβ mediates the transcriptional induction of Bim using hepatocyte cell lines that undergo apoptosis in the presence of TGFβ. We demonstrate that TGFβ stimulates Bim transcription by up-regulating the expression of the transcription factor Runx1 through an IRES-dependent mechanism. TGFβ-induced Runx1, in turn, binds to FOXO3, residing at its forkhead binding site, and the two cooperate to stimulate Bim promoter transactivation. TGFβ was a generous gift from Genzyme Inc.

Whole cell lysates were prepared in TNMG buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were sonicated briefly and clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min in a Beckman tabletop microcentrifuge at maximum speed. Protein concentration of the extracts was determined using Bradford's reagent (Pierce). Western blot analysis was performed by standard SDS-PAGE, as described previously (33Qi X.J. Wildey G.M. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 813-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).

ELISA results are expressed as the ratio of the ABS405 signal of TGFβ-treated samples normalized to the ABS405 signal of the control sample. Northern blots were performed using mRNA as described previously (15Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Total RNA (∼200 μg) was isolated from a 150-mm dish of cells using an RNeasy Mini kit, and mRNA was purified from equal amounts of total RNA using an Oligotex mRNA Mini kit. Blots were hybridized in NorthernMax Prehyb/Hyb buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX) and typically washed with 0.1% SDS, 0.5× SSC at 55 °C.

Transient transfection of cells was accomplished using ExpressFect under serum-free conditions following the manufacturer's instructions. After 5–6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with complete medium with or without TGFβ as indicated. For reporter assays, about 100,000 cells/well were seeded into 12-well plates and typically transfected with 0.5 μg of the mouse 0.8 Bim luciferase promoter construct (34Bouillet P. Zhang L.C.

GFP was used as a negative control, to ensure that all cells received equal amounts of DNA. Approximately 24 h after the start of transfection, the cells were collected in 200 μl of lysis buffer, and a 20-μl aliquot was assayed for luciferase activity using Stop & Glo® reagent (Promega). For Western blot and DNA ladder experiments, 4 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes and transfected with up to 10 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA. GFP was again used to balance the amount of DNA transfected into cells. Cells were collected 24 h later for analyses. The human pLNCX-FLAG-AML1a (Runx1A) and pLNCX-FLAG-AML1b (Runx1B) expression plasmids have been described previously (35Kitabayashi I. Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Yokoyama A. Ohki M.

In siRNA experiments, cells were plated into a 24-well dish (50,000 cells/well) for Western blot and ELISA studies or a 6-well dish (400,000 cells/well) for RT-PCR studies. Cells were transfected with specific siRNAs or non-targeting siRNAs in serum-free medium for 5–6 h at a final concentration of 100 nm using DharmaFECT 4 reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. An equal volume of complete medium containing 2× fetal calf serum and antibiotics was then added, and the transfection was continued for 24 h. The next day, TGFβ was added, and the cells were incubated overnight. Cells were analyzed by Western blot, ELISA, and RT-PCR as described above and below. Microarray analysis was performed using the Illumina Mouse-6 BeadChip platform as described previously (27Ramesh S. Qi X.J. Wildey G.M. Robinson J. Molkentin J. Letterio J. Howe P.H. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 990-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was prepared as described above from control and TGFβ-treated (30 min and 1 h) AML-12 hepatocytes from two experiments. cRNA synthesis, hybridization, and washing were performed using Illumina reagents following the manufacturer's directions. The data output from the Illumina BeadChip scanner was normalized using the rank-invariant method and analyzed using BeadStudio software. Total RNA was prepared as described above using an RNeasy Mini kit. RNA was subjected to DNase digestion using DNA-free (Ambion), and cDNA was prepared using random primers supplied with the SuperScript III RT kit (Stratagene). The primers used to amplify the 3′-UTR of mouse Runx1 were 5′-AAACAAGTTGGTAGGTAACGCAGC-3′ for the top strand and 5′-TGACTGATTCCACTAAGACTGGGAG-3′ for the bottom strand. The PCR reaction was annealed at 55.1 °C and run for 28 cycles to generate a 524-bp product. The primers used to amplify the 3′-UTR of human Runx1 were 5′-CGCTGGAAAGCAAACAGGAAG-3′ for the top strand and 5′-GGTCAAAGCAAGAAAGAAGC AAGC-3′ for the bottom strand. The PCR reaction was annealed at 52.9 °C and run for 28 cycles to generate a 319-bp product. The primers for β-actin PCR were described previously (15Wildey G.M. Patil S. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18069-18077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The PCR reaction was annealed at 66 °C and run for 18 cycles. The IRES 5′-UTR of Runx1 was amplified from mouse primary B-cell cDNA using a top strand primer of 5′-GGCTGGCACTTCCATCCTG-3′ and a bottom strand primer of 5′-CACAACAAGCCGATTGAGTAAGG-3′. An approximate 1.4-kb product was generated after 35 cycles using an annealing temperature of 56.3 °C. The IRES PCR product was TA-cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega), which was digested with EcoRI to produce a probe for Northern blots. The primary B-cells were isolated and cultured as described previously (27Ramesh S. Qi X.J. Wildey G.M. Robinson J. Molkentin J. Letterio J. Howe P.H.

The cap 5′-UTR of Runx1 was amplified from cDNA prepared from a human B-cell line (Daudi) using a top strand primer of 5′-AACCACAAGTTGGGTAGCCTGG-3′ and a bottom strand primer of 5′-AAAATGCTGTCTGAAGCCATCG-3′. An approximate 171-bp product was generated after 32 cycles using an annealing temperature of 55.6 °C. The cap PCR product was purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and used for Northern blots. Daudi cells were cultured as described above. All PCR reactions used AccuPrime Taq polymerase using Buffer I (Invitrogen) except for the β-actin PCR reactions, which used Hot-Start Taq (Denville Scientific). Nuclear extract preparation for EMSA, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation experiments was performed following the method of Schreiber et al. (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Typically, cells from one 100-mm culture dish were resuspended in 400 μl of hypotonic buffer, and the nuclear pellet was extracted in 100 μl of a high salt buffer. Protein concentration of the extracts was determined using Bradford's reagent. Typically 5 μg of nuclear extract was analyzed in EMSA and 150 μg in Western blotting experiments. Hep3B cells were seeded into a 24-well dish at a density of 100,000 cells/well in serum-containing medium. The next day rapamycin (20 nm) was added for up to 24 h. During the last hour of each treatment [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to a concentration of 100 μCi/ml in serum-free medium lacking methionine. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 130 mm NaCl). The lysate was centrifuged, and 10 μl of the supernatant was added to 100 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml in lysis buffer). Proteins were precipitated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and collected by membrane filtration. Radioactivity on the membranes was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Whole cell lysates for immunoprecipitation (IP) were prepared in IP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors. Cell lysates (250 μg) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg of anti-FLAG antibody in 800 μl of IP lysis buffer containing protein G-agarose. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times in IP lysis buffer. The presence of forkhead protein in the immune complexes was detected by Western blotting. Nuclear extracts (1 mg) were prepared as described above, diluted 5-fold in IP lysis buffer, and precleared with protein G-agarose and rabbit IgG. After centrifugation, the supernatant was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with 15 ml of anti-Runx1 antibody and protein G. The immune complexes were collected and analyzed for forkhead protein as described above except that protein A-HRP was used as the secondary antibody. EMSAs were performed following the method of Lewis and Konradi (39Lewis S.E. Konradi C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1996; 10: 301-311Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a 20 μl volume. Nuclear extract was added to binding buffer and preincubated on ice for up to 1 h. Radiolabeled probe was then added, and the binding reaction was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. Where indicated, 2 μl of supershift antibody or “cold” excess oligonucleotide (200 ng) was added during the preincubation step. Samples were loaded onto 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gels and run at 250 V for 4–5 h. The gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis. The probe used in the EMSA was a 54-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a 3× concatamer of the sequence 5′-TCCGGTAAACACGCCAGG-3′ from the human Bim promoter. The underlined sequence indicates the consensus forkhead binding site (40Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5002-5012Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). This oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the T4 kinase reaction to generate the EMSA probe. Three unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used as cold competitors in the EMSA binding reactions were as follows: 6X-RBE, a 42-bp oligo containing a 6× concatamer of the consensus Runx binding sequence 5′-AACCACA-3′ (41Otto F. Lübbert M. Stock M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); FasL, a 40-bp oligo from the human FasL promoter containing four forkhead binding sites (underlined) within the sequence 5′-TCTCTATTTAAATAAATAAGTAAATAAATAAACTGGGCAA-3′ (42Holtz-Heppelmann C.J.

ChIP and reChIP assays were performed following the method of Shang et al. (43Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hep3B cells were seeded into 150-mm culture dishes and transiently transfected with Runx1B overnight. The next day the cells were fixed with formaldehyde, lysed in 500 μl of buffer, and sonicated. After centrifugation to clarify the lysates, 200 μl of the supernatant was precleared with IgG and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed at 4 °C and eluted twice at room temperature with 100-μl aliquots of a freshly made sodium bicarbonate/SDS buffer. In reChIP experiments, the initial Runx ChIP was eluted using 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C and then diluted 50× in buffer for subsequent immunoprecipitations. ChIP eluates were heated overnight at 65 °C with NaCl to reverse the protein-DNA cross-links and purified on a Qiagen PCR purification column. The column was eluted with 50 μl of buffer from which, typically, 2–5 μl of eluate was used in each 25-μl PCR reaction. PCR was performed using AccuPrime Taq with the supplied Buffer II (Invitrogen). The primers used to amplify the human Bim genomic fragment containing the FOXO3 site were 5′-GTAGGTGAGCGGGAG"
https://openalex.org/W1988363837,"Background Misfolding- and aggregation-prone proteins underlying Parkinson's, Huntington's and Machado-Joseph diseases, namely α-synuclein, huntingtin, and ataxin-3 respectively, adopt numerous intracellular conformations during pathogenesis, including globular intermediates and insoluble amyloid-like fibrils. Such conformational diversity has complicated research into amyloid-associated intracellular dysfunction and neurodegeneration. To this end, recombinant single-chain Fv antibodies (scFvs) are compelling molecular tools that can be selected against specific protein conformations, and expressed inside cells as intrabodies, for investigative and therapeutic purposes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and live-cell fluorescence microscopy, we report that a human scFv selected against the fibrillar form of α-synuclein targets isomorphic conformations of misfolded polyglutamine proteins. When expressed in the cytoplasm of striatal cells, this conformation-specific intrabody co-localizes with intracellular aggregates of misfolded ataxin-3 and a pathological fragment of huntingtin, and enhances the aggregation propensity of both disease-linked polyglutamine proteins. Using this intrabody as a tool for modulating the kinetics of amyloidogenesis, we show that escalating aggregate formation of a pathologic huntingtin fragment is not cytoprotective in striatal cells, but rather heightens oxidative stress and cell death as detected by flow cytometry. Instead, cellular protection is achieved by suppressing aggregation using a previously described intrabody that binds to the amyloidogenic N-terminus of huntingtin. Analogous cytotoxic results are observed following conformational targeting of normal or polyglutamine-expanded human ataxin-3, which partially aggregate through non-polyglutamine domains. Conclusions/Significance These findings validate that the rate of aggregation modulates polyglutamine-mediated intracellular dysfunction, and caution that molecules designed to specifically hasten aggregation may be detrimental as therapies for polyglutamine disorders. Moreover, our findings introduce a novel antibody-based tool that, as a consequence of its general specificity for fibrillar conformations and its ability to function intracellularly, offers broad research potential for a variety of human amyloid diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1964991608,"NSP-interacting kinase (NIK1) is a receptor-like kinase identified as a virulence target of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP). We found that NIK1 undergoes a stepwise pattern of phosphorylation within its activation-loop domain (A-loop) with distinct roles for different threonine residues. Mutations at Thr-474 or Thr-468 impaired autophosphorylation and were defective for kinase activation. In contrast, a mutation at Thr-469 did not impact autophosphorylation and increased substrate phosphorylation, suggesting an inhibitory role for Thr-469 in kinase function. To dissect the functional significance of these results, we used NSP-expressing virus infection as a mechanism to interfere with wild type and mutant NIK1 action in plants. The NIK1 knockout mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to virus infections, a phenotype that could be complemented with ectopic expression of a 35S-NIK1 or 35S-T469A NIK1 transgenes. However, ectopic expression of an inactive kinase or the 35S-T474A NIK1 mutant did not reverse the enhanced susceptibility phenotype of knockout lines, demonstrating that Thr-474 autophosphorylation was needed to transduce a defense response to geminiviruses. Furthermore, mutations at Thr-474 and Thr-469 residues antagonistically affected NIK-mediated nuclear relocation of the downstream effector rpL10. These results establish that NIK1 functions as an authentic defense receptor as it requires activation to elicit a defense response. Our data also suggest a model whereby phosphorylation-dependent activation of a plant receptor-like kinase enables the A-loop to control differentially auto- and substrate phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2142270194,"To further evaluate the role of Rft1 in the transbilayer movement of Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (M5-DLO), a series of experiments was conducted with intact cells and sealed microsomal vesicles. First, an unexpectedly large accumulation (37-fold) of M5-DLO was observed in Rft1-depleted cells (YG1137) relative to Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol in wild type (SS328) cells when glycolipid levels were compared by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis analysis. When sealed microsomes from wild type cells and cells depleted of Rft1 were incubated with GDP-[3H]mannose or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc in the presence of unlabeled GDP-Man, no difference was observed in the rate of synthesis of [3H]Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol or Man9[3H]GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol, respectively. In addition, no difference was seen in the level of M5-DLO flippase activity in sealed wild type and Rft1-depleted microsomal vesicles when the activity was assessed by the transport of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol15, a water-soluble analogue. The entry of the analogue into the lumenal compartment was confirmed by demonstrating that [3H]chitobiosyl units were transferred to endogenous peptide acceptors via the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase when sealed vesicles were incubated with [3H]GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol15 in the presence of an exogenously supplied acceptor peptide. In addition, several enzymes involved in Dol-P and lipid intermediate biosynthesis were found to be up-regulated in Rft1-depleted cells. All of these results indicate that although Rft1 may play a critical role in vivo, depletion of this protein does not impair the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO in sealed microsomal fractions prepared from disrupted cells.

In the first stage the lipid intermediates Man-P-dolichol (Man-P-Dol), Glc-P-dolichol (Glc-P-Dol), and Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (M5-DLO) are formed on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER with GDP-Man, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcNAc, serving as the glycosyl donors. The biosynthesis of the mature DLO is completed with the addition of four more mannosyl units and the formation of the triglucosyl cap in the second stage after the transbilayer movement of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and M5-DLO to the lumenal monolayer. Although many details about the genetics, enzymology, and regulation of these 14 glycosylation reactions are known, there is virtually nothing known about the ER proteins that are presumably required to allow the lipid-bound hydrophilic glycosyl groups to traverse the hydrophobic core of the ER bilayer.The PER5/RFT1 gene was originally identified by Walter and coworkers (5Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J.

However, a series of experiments conducted with sealed microsomal vesicles indicate that, although Rft1 may be required to overcome a biophysical constraint for the flipping of M5-DLO in vivo, its depletion does not hinder the flipping of M5-DLO in sealed microsomal preparations in vitro. The resemblance of these results to the loss of the requirement for the Lec35 gene (12Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 355-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Pomorski T. Menon A.K. Cell. Mol.

Of the many mechanistic and regulatory aspects of the dolichol pathway, progress has been extremely slow in devising assays for, and identifying, ER proteins involved in the flip-flopping of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and M5-DLO. Thus, the genetic evidence (7Helenius J. Ng D.T. Marolda C.L. Walter P. Valvano M.A. Aebi M. Nature. 2002; 415: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that implicated Rft1 in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO aroused considerable interest in this field. The objective of the in vitro studies reported here was to obtain more biochemical evidence to support a role of Rft1 in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO using sealed microsomal vesicles from yeast as a detergent-free model system.Although FACE analyses provided solid evidence that large chemical amounts of M5-DLO accumulated in Rft1-depleted yeast cells, several types of experiments indicate that Rft1 is not required for the transverse diffusion of M5-DLO from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the lumenal monolayer in sealed microsomal preparations.Although the precise extent of depletion of Rft1 in the vesicles used as a model system is uncertain, based on a dilution of endogenous Rft1 into the daughter cells after the switch from galactose to glucose as the primary carbon source, glucose-grown cells would contain less than 0.003% of the initial content of Rft1 after only 15 generations. This number declines to 0.00095% after 20 generations. This estimate is based on the assumptions that Rft1 synthesis ceases immediately upon the switch to glucose as carbon source and that Rft1 is not being actively degraded.In one approach the formation of M9-DLO was assayed by incubating sealed microsomes with GDP-[3H]Man. Under these in vitro conditions sealed vesicles from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells both formed [3H]M9-DLO, and no accumulation of [3H]M5-DLO was observed. The incorporation of [3H]mannose into Man-P-Dol and DLOs was actually higher in sealed vesicles from Rft1-depleted cells compared with wild type cells, suggesting that Man-P-Dol synthase was up-regulated in response to loss of Rft1 function. It should be noted that the enzymes that require Dol-P as acceptor substrate, Man-P-Dol synthase and GlcNAc phosphate transferase, show an even greater stimulation in the absence of exogenously added Dol-P, suggesting that microsomal fractions from Rft1-depleted cells contain higher levels of endogenous Dol-P available for lipid intermediate biosynthesis relative to wild type cells. Thus, it is possible that this global elevation of biosynthetic enzyme activities contributed to the marked increase of M5-DLO after Rft1 depletion (Fig. 1).To demonstrate directly that newly synthesized M5-DLO was flipped in sealed microsomes, the same comparison was done by pre-labeling endogenous GlcNAc1–2-P-P-Dol by incubating the microsomal preparations with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc followed by the addition of unlabeled GDP-Man. The observation that [3H]GlcNAc-labeled M9-DLO was synthesized by control and Rft1-depleted microsomes provides convincing evidence that newly formed M5-DLO was flipped in sealed microsomes from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells at approximately the same rate. It is interesting that the amount of M9-DLO formed by Rft1-depleted microsomes was actually higher than the control microsomes. It is also curious that despite the large amount of M5-DLO detected by FACE analysis, there was no evidence that the newly synthesized intermediate, [3H]GlcNAc-labeled M5-DLO, was isotopically diluted by the relatively large endogenous pool. It is possible that at least a portion of the M5-DLO pool accumulates in a metabolically inert compartment as observed in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis mouse models (39Cho S.K. Gao N. Pearce D.A. Lehrman M.A. Hofmann S.L. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).To obtain additional evidence for M5-DLO flippase activity, another approach was taken assaying the transport of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol15, a water-soluble analogue of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol95 that has been shown to be flipped, presumably by the same flippase mediating the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO, in microsomes from a variety of tissues and yeast (29Reuvers F. Habets-Willems C. Reinking A. Boer P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Lehle L. Tanner W. Eur. J.

The results from this experimental approach also indicated that the analogue entered the sealed microsomal vesicles from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells at essentially the same rate. The observation that transport of the water-soluble analogue appears to reach a higher equilibrium value in Rft1-depleted vesicles suggests that the Rft1-depleted microsomal vesicles are either more highly enriched in ER or may have a slightly larger volume, possibly as a consequence of the unfolded protein response. Entry of the analogue to the lumenal compartment was verified by showing that the labeled disaccharide was transferred to a permeant N-glycosylatable peptide acceptor.The results presented here using a detergent-free model system are in accord with recent related studies (9Frank C.G. Sanyal S. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Menon A.K. Nature. 2008; 454: E3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Sanyal S. Frank C.G. Menon A.K.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) which have demonstrated that the flipping of M5-DLO in reconstituted proteoliposomes, assessed by a concanavalin A-capture assay, occurs similarly in the presence or absence of Rft1. The reconstituted flippase activity could be clearly resolved from Rft1 and a glycerophospholipid translocase by Cibacron Blue dye resin chromatography (10Sanyal S. Frank C.G. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7937-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and very significantly, the flippase activity discriminated between the natural intermediate that is flipped, M5-DLO, and M7-DLO (11Sanyal S. Menon A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).This study also extends the description of the mutant cells by showing that several enzymes involved in Dol-P and lipid intermediate biosynthesis are elevated as a result of the loss of Rft1 function. In addition, the rate of transport of Man-P-Dol10 and Glc-P-Dol10 was slightly elevated in vesicles from Rft1-depleted cells relative to wild type cells (data not included), suggesting that Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol flippases as well as the enzymes involved in Dol-P and lipid intermediate synthesis assayed in Table 2 could also be up-regulated as a compensatory response to the impaired transbilayer movement or accumulation of M5-DLO in vivo. In related studies, per5/rft1 mutants were identified on the basis of their requirement for an intact unfolded protein response for survival (5Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and Travers et al. (40Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) have reported that genes encoding pertinent enzymes in the dolichol pathway, including DPM1, ALG7, and SEC59, are up-regulated during the unfolded protein response in S. cerevisiae based on mRNA levels.Finally, the results described in this report do not entirely exclude the possibility that Rft1 plays a role in the flipping of M5-DLO in intact living cells. However, it appears that whatever cellular or biophysical constraints that require Rft1 for flipping in vivo apparently no longer exist after cells are disrupted. This observation is reminiscent of the function of Lec35, which is essential for the utilization of Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol in intact cells but not in ER vesicles (12Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is quite possible that some structural aspects of the organization of the ER are lost when cells are disrupted during the preparation of microsomal fractions. In any case, more genetic and biochemical studies will be required to elucidate the precise function of Rft1 in vivo and to identify other ER proteins that are involved in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO as well as Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol.

In the first stage the lipid intermediates Man-P-dolichol (Man-P-Dol), Glc-P-dolichol (Glc-P-Dol), and Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol (M5-DLO) are formed on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER with GDP-Man, UDP-Glc, and UDP-GlcNAc, serving as the glycosyl donors. The biosynthesis of the mature DLO is completed with the addition of four more mannosyl units and the formation of the triglucosyl cap in the second stage after the transbilayer movement of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and M5-DLO to the lumenal monolayer. Although many details about the genetics, enzymology, and regulation of these 14 glycosylation reactions are known, there is virtually nothing known about the ER proteins that are presumably required to allow the lipid-bound hydrophilic glycosyl groups to traverse the hydrophobic core of the ER bilayer.

The PER5/RFT1 gene was originally identified by Walter and coworkers (5Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) as a gene that was up-regulated by the unfolded protein response and required for efficient protein N-glycosylation in yeast.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22556-22564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the rft1 mutation was shown to be inscrutably suppressed by p53, a soluble protein that has not been found in yeast. Helenius et al. (7Helenius J. Ng D.T. Marolda C.L. Walter P. Valvano M.A. Aebi M. Nature. 2002; 415: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) have reported evidence from metabolic labeling experiments indicating that the RFT1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a protein that is involved in the flipping of M5-DLO in vivo. More recently, a point mutation in the human orthologue of the RFT1 gene has been shown to result in the accumulation of M5-DLO in fibroblasts from a patient containing an R67C amino acid substitution (8Haeuptle M.A. Pujol F.M.

Although these results implicate Rft1 in the transverse diffusion of M5-DLO, the topological orientation of the accumulated intermediate in the mutant cells and the precise function of the protein in the transbilayer movement of the glycolipid intermediate remain to be defined. Two reports (9Frank C.G. Sanyal S. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Menon A.K. Nature. 2008; 454: E3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Sanyal S. Frank C.G. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7937-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Rft1 is not required for the “flipping” of M5-DLO in a reconstituted proteoliposomal system, raising questions about the precise relationship between Rft1 and the M5-DLO flippase. A more recent corroborative study further characterizing the reconstituted flippase activity indicates that the in vitro assay exhibits an impressive specificity for M5-DLO (11Sanyal S. Menon A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

It is quite possible that some structural aspects of the organization of the ER are lost when cells are disrupted during the preparation of microsomal fractions. In any case, more genetic and biochemical studies will be required to elucidate the precise function of Rft1 in vivo and to identify other ER proteins that are involved in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO as well as Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol. It has been recognized for many years that flippases play crucial roles in membrane biology in membrane bilayer biogenesis, glycerophospholipid asymmetry, and the translocation of polar glycolipid intermediates in glycoprotein and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor biosynthesis (35Menon A.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 355-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Pomorski T. Menon A.K. Cell. Mol.

Of the many mechanistic and regulatory aspects of the dolichol pathway, progress has been extremely slow in devising assays for, and identifying, ER proteins involved in the flip-flopping of Man-P-Dol, Glc-P-Dol, and M5-DLO. Thus, the genetic evidence (7Helenius J. Ng D.T. Marolda C.L. Walter P. Valvano M.A. Aebi M. Nature. 2002; 415: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) that implicated Rft1 in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO aroused considerable interest in this field. The objective of the in vitro studies reported here was to obtain more biochemical evidence to support a role of Rft1 in the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO using sealed microsomal vesicles from yeast as a detergent-free model system. Although FACE analyses provided solid evidence that large chemical amounts of M5-DLO accumulated in Rft1-depleted yeast cells, several types of experiments indicate that Rft1 is not required for the transverse diffusion of M5-DLO from the cytoplasmic leaflet to the lumenal monolayer in sealed microsomal preparations. Although the precise extent of depletion of Rft1 in the vesicles used as a model system is uncertain, based on a dilution of endogenous Rft1 into the daughter cells after the switch from galactose to glucose as the primary carbon source, glucose-grown cells would contain less than 0.003% of the initial content of Rft1 after only 15 generations. This number declines to 0.00095% after 20 generations. This estimate is based on the assumptions that Rft1 synthesis ceases immediately upon the switch to glucose as carbon source and that Rft1 is not being actively degraded. In one approach the formation of M9-DLO was assayed by incubating sealed microsomes with GDP-[3H]Man. Under these in vitro conditions sealed vesicles from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells both formed [3H]M9-DLO, and no accumulation of [3H]M5-DLO was observed. The incorporation of [3H]mannose into Man-P-Dol and DLOs was actually higher in sealed vesicles from Rft1-depleted cells compared with wild type cells, suggesting that Man-P-Dol synthase was up-regulated in response to loss of Rft1 function. It should be noted that the enzymes that require Dol-P as acceptor substrate, Man-P-Dol synthase and GlcNAc phosphate transferase, show an even greater stimulation in the absence of exogenously added Dol-P, suggesting that microsomal fractions from Rft1-depleted cells contain higher levels of endogenous Dol-P available for lipid intermediate biosynthesis relative to wild type cells. Thus, it is possible that this global elevation of biosynthetic enzyme activities contributed to the marked increase of M5-DLO after Rft1 depletion (Fig. 1). To demonstrate directly that newly synthesized M5-DLO was flipped in sealed microsomes, the same comparison was done by pre-labeling endogenous GlcNAc1–2-P-P-Dol by incubating the microsomal preparations with UDP-[3H]GlcNAc followed by the addition of unlabeled GDP-Man. The observation that [3H]GlcNAc-labeled M9-DLO was synthesized by control and Rft1-depleted microsomes provides convincing evidence that newly formed M5-DLO was flipped in sealed microsomes from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells at approximately the same rate. It is interesting that the amount of M9-DLO formed by Rft1-depleted microsomes was actually higher than the control microsomes. It is also curious that despite the large amount of M5-DLO detected by FACE analysis, there was no evidence that the newly synthesized intermediate, [3H]GlcNAc-labeled M5-DLO, was isotopically diluted by the relatively large endogenous pool. It is possible that at least a portion of the M5-DLO pool accumulates in a metabolically inert compartment as observed in neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis mouse models (39Cho S.K. Gao N. Pearce D.A. Lehrman M.A. Hofmann S.L. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To obtain additional evidence for M5-DLO flippase activity, another approach was taken assaying the transport of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol15, a water-soluble analogue of GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol95 that has been shown to be flipped, presumably by the same flippase mediating the transbilayer movement of M5-DLO, in microsomes from a variety of tissues and yeast (29Reuvers F. Habets-Willems C. Reinking A. Boer P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 486: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Lehle L. Tanner W. Eur. J.

The results from this experimental approach also indicated that the analogue entered the sealed microsomal vesicles from wild type and Rft1-depleted cells at essentially the same rate. The observation that transport of the water-soluble analogue appears to reach a higher equilibrium value in Rft1-depleted vesicles suggests that the Rft1-depleted microsomal vesicles are either more highly enriched in ER or may have a slightly larger volume, possibly as a consequence of the unfolded protein response. Entry of the analogue to the lumenal compartment was verified by showing that the labeled disaccharide was transferred to a permeant N-glycosylatable peptide acceptor. The results presented here using a detergent-free model system are in accord with recent related studies (9Frank C.G. Sanyal S. Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Menon A.K. Nature. 2008; 454: E3-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Sanyal S. Frank C.G. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7937-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Sanyal S.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) which have demonstrated that the flipping of M5-DLO in reconstituted proteoliposomes, assessed by a concanavalin A-capture assay, occurs similarly in the presence or absence of Rft1. The reconstituted flippase activity could be clearly resolved from Rft1 and a glycerophospholipid translocase by Cibacron Blue dye resin chromatography (10Sanyal S. Frank C.G. Menon A.K. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7937-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and very significantly, the flippase activity discriminated between the natural intermediate that is flipped, M5-DLO, and M7-DLO (11Sanyal S. Menon A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study also extends the description of the mutant cells by showing that several enzymes involved in Dol-P and lipid intermediate biosynthesis are elevated as a result of the loss of Rft1 function. In addition, the rate of transport of Man-P-Dol10 and Glc-P-Dol10 was slightly elevated in vesicles from Rft1-depleted cells relative to wild type cells (data not included), suggesting that Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol flippases as well as the enzymes involved in Dol-P and lipid intermediate synthesis assayed in Table 2 could also be up-regulated as a compensatory response to the impaired transbilayer movement or accumulation of M5-DLO in vivo. In related studies, per5/rft1 mutants were identified on the basis of their requirement for an intact unfolded protein response for survival (5Ng D.T. Spear E.D. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and Travers et al. (40Travers K.J. Patil C.K. Wodicka L. Lockhart D.J. Weissman J.S. Walter P. Cell. 2000; 101: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) have reported that genes encoding pertinent enzymes in the dolichol pathway, including DPM1, ALG7, and SEC59, are up-regulated during the unfolded protein response in S. cerevisiae based on mRNA levels. Finally, the results described in this report do not entirely exclude the possibility that Rft1 plays a role in the flipping of M5-DLO in intact living cells. However, it appears that whatever cellular or biophysical constraints that require Rft1 for flipping in vivo apparently no longer exist after cells are disrupted. This observation is reminiscent of the function of Lec35, which is essential for the utilization of Man-P-Dol and Glc-P-Dol in intact cells but not in ER vesicles (12Anand M. Rush J.S. Ray S. Doucey M.A. Weik J. Ware F.E. Hofsteenge J. Waechter C.J. Lehrman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 487-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2066133198,"The sarcoglycans are known as an integral subcomplex of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex, the function of which is best characterized in skeletal muscle in relation to muscular dystrophies. Here we demonstrate that the white adipocytes, which share a common precursor with the myocytes, express a cell-specific sarcoglycan complex containing β-, δ-, and ϵ-sarcoglycan. In addition, the adipose sarcoglycan complex associates with sarcospan and laminin binding dystroglycan. Using multiple sarcoglycan null mouse models, we show that loss of α-sarcoglycan has no consequence on the expression of the adipocyte sarcoglycan complex. However, loss of β- or δ-sarcoglycan leads to a concomitant loss of the sarcoglycan complex as well as sarcospan and a dramatic reduction in dystroglycan in adipocytes. We further demonstrate that β-sarcoglycan null mice, which lack the sarcoglycan complex in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, are glucose-intolerant and exhibit whole body insulin resistance specifically due to impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscles. Thus, our data demonstrate a novel function of the sarcoglycan complex in whole body glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle metabolism, suggesting that the impairment of the skeletal muscle metabolism influences the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2045292033,"Parental investment is a limited resource for which offspring compete in order to increase their own survival and reproductive success. However, parents might be selected to influence the outcome of sibling competition through differential investment. While evidence for this is widespread in egg-laying species, whether or not this may also be the case in viviparous species is more difficult to determine. We use pre-industrial Finns as our model system and an equal investment model as our null hypothesis, which predicts that (all else being equal) middleborns should be disadvantaged through competition. We found no overall evidence to suggest that middleborns in a family are disadvantaged in terms of their survival, age at first reproduction or lifetime reproductive success. However, when considering birth-order only among same-sexed siblings, first-, middle- and lastborn sons significantly differed in the number of offspring they were able to rear to adulthood, although there was no similar effect among females. Middleborn sons appeared to produce significantly less offspring than first- or lastborn sons, but they did not significantly differ from lastborn sons in the number of offspring reared to adulthood. Our results thus show that taking sex differences into account is important when modelling birth-order effects. We found clear evidence of firstborn sons being advantaged over other sons in the family, and over firstborn daughters. Therefore, our results suggest that parents invest differentially in their offspring in order to both preferentially favour particular offspring or reduce offspring inequalities arising from sibling competition."
https://openalex.org/W1969092234,"In this study we analyzed the structure and function of a truncated form of hemolysin A (HpmA265) from Proteus mirabilis using a series of functional and structural studies. Hemolysin A belongs to the two-partner secretion pathway. The two-partner secretion pathway has been identified as the most common protein secretion pathway among Gram-negative bacteria. Currently, the mechanism of action for the two-partner hemolysin members is not fully understood. In this study, hemolysis experiments revealed a unidirectional, cooperative, biphasic activity profile after full-length, inactive hemolysin A was seeded with truncated hemolysin A. We also solved the first x-ray structure of a TpsA hemolysin. The truncated hemolysin A formed a right-handed parallel beta-helix with three adjoining segments of anti-parallel beta-sheet. A CXXC disulfide bond, four buried solvent molecules, and a carboxyamide ladder were all located at the third complete beta-helix coil. Replacement of the CXXC motif led to decreased activity and stability according to hemolysis and CD studies. Furthermore, the crystal structure revealed a sterically compatible, dry dimeric interface formed via anti-parallel beta-sheet interactions between neighboring beta-helix monomers. Laser scanning confocal microscopy further supported the unidirectional interconversion of full-length hemolysin A. From these results, a model has been proposed, where cooperative, beta-strand interactions between HpmA265 and neighboring full-length hemolysin A molecules, facilitated in part by the highly conserved CXXC pattern, account for the template-assisted hemolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1992438876,"Mitochondrial biogenesis is under the control of two different genetic systems: the nuclear genome (nDNA) and the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The mtDNA is a circular genome of 16.6 kb encoding 13 of the approximately 90 subunits that form the respiratory chain, the remaining ones being encoded by the nDNA. Eukaryotic cells are able to monitor and respond to changes in mitochondrial function through alterations in nuclear gene expression, a phenomenon first defined in yeast and known as retrograde regulation. To investigate how the cellular transcriptome is modified in response to the absence of mtDNA, we used Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip arrays to study the gene expression profile of two human cell lines, 143BTK(-) and A549, which had been entirely depleted of mtDNA (rho(o) cells), and compared it with that of corresponding undepleted parental cells (rho(+) cells).Our data indicate that absence of mtDNA is associated with: i) a down-regulation of cell cycle control genes and a reduction of cell replication rate, ii) a down-regulation of nuclear-encoded subunits of complex III of the respiratory chain and iii) a down-regulation of a gene described as the human homolog of ELAC2 of E. coli, which encodes a protein that we show to also target to the mitochondrial compartment.Our results indicate a strong correlation between mitochondrial biogenesis and cell cycle control and suggest that some proteins could have a double role: for instance in controlling both cell cycle progression and mitochondrial functions. In addition, the finding that ELAC2 and maybe other transcripts that are located into mitochondria, are down-regulated in rho(o) cells, make them good candidates for human disorders associated with defective replication and expression of mtDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2054688840,"Background Community interactions can produce complex dynamics with counterintuitive responses. Synanthropic community members are of increasing practical interest for their effects on biodiversity and public health. Most studies incorporating introduced species have been performed on islands where they may pose a risk to the native fauna. Few have examined their interactions in urban environments where they represent the majority of species. We characterized house cat (Felis catus) predation on wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), and its population effects in an urban area as a model system. Three aspects of predation likely to influence population dynamics were examined; the stratum of the prey population killed by predators, the intensity of the predation, and the size of the predator population. Methodology/Principal Findings Predation pressure was estimated from the sizes of the rat and cat populations, and the characteristics of rats killed in 20 alleys. Short and long term responses of rat population to perturbations were examined by removal trapping. Perturbations removed an average of 56% of the rats/alley but had no negative long-term impact on the size of the rat population (49.6±12.5 rats/alley and 123.8±42.2 rats/alley over two years). The sizes of the cat population during two years (3.5 animals/alley and 2.7 animals/alley) also were unaffected by rat population perturbations. Predation by cats occurred in 9/20 alleys. Predated rats were predominantly juveniles and significantly smaller (144.6 g±17.8 g) than the trapped rats (385.0 g±135.6 g). Cats rarely preyed on the larger, older portion of the rat population. Conclusions/Significance The rat population appears resilient to perturbation from even substantial population reduction using targeted removal. In this area there is a relatively low population density of cats and they only occasionally prey on the rat population. This occasional predation primarily removes the juvenile proportion of the rat population. The top predator in this urban ecosystem appears to have little impact on the size of the prey population, and similarly, reduction in rat populations doesn't impact the size of the cat population. However, the selected targeting of small rats may locally influence the size structure of the population which may have consequences for patterns of pathogen transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2052551677,"Background Optical and spectroscopic technologies working at subcellular resolution with quantitative output are required for a deeper understanding of molecular processes and mechanisms in living cells. Such technologies are prerequisite for the realisation of predictive biology at cellular and subcellular level. However, although established in the physical sciences, these techniques are rarely applied to cell biology in the plant sciences. Principal Findings Here, we present a combined application of one-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy and wavelength-selective fluorescence microscopy to analyse the function of a GFP fusion of the Brassinosteroid Insensitive 1 Receptor (BRI1-GFP) with high spatial and temporal resolution in living Arabidopsis cells in their tissue environment. We show a rapid, brassinolide-induced cell wall expansion and a fast BR-regulated change in the BRI1-GFP fluorescence lifetime in the plasmamembrane in vivo. Both cell wall expansion and changes in fluorescence lifetime reflect early BR-induced and BRI1-dependent physiological or signalling processes. Our experiments also show the potential of one-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy for the in vivo monitoring of the biochemical and biophysical subcellular environment using GFP fusion proteins as probes. Significance One-chromophore fluorescence lifetime microscopy, combined with wavelength-specific fluorescence microscopy, opens up new frontiers for in vivo dynamic and quantitative analysis of cellular processes at high resolution which are not addressable by pure imaging technologies or transmission electron microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2087815783,"The RAG encoded proteins, RAG-1 and RAG-2 regulate site-specific recombination events in somatic immune B- and T-lymphocytes to generate the acquired immune repertoire. Catalytic activities of the RAG proteins are related to the recombinase functions of a pre-existing mobile DNA element in the DDE recombinase/RNAse H family, sometimes termed the ""RAG transposon"".Novel to this work is the suggestion that the DDE recombinase responsible for the origins of acquired immunity was encoded by a primordial herpes virus, rather than a ""RAG transposon."" A subsequent ""arms race"" between immunity to herpes infection and the immune system obscured primary amino acid similarities between herpes and immune system proteins but preserved regulatory, structural and functional similarities between the respective recombinase proteins. In support of this hypothesis, evidence is reviewed from previous published data that a modern herpes virus protein family with properties of a viral recombinase is co-regulated with both RAG-1 and RAG-2 by closely linked cis-acting co-regulatory sequences. Structural and functional similarity is also reviewed between the putative herpes recombinase and both DDE site of the RAG-1 protein and another DDE/RNAse H family nuclease, the Argonaute protein component of RISC (RNA induced silencing complex).A ""co-regulatory"" model of the origins of V(D)J recombination and the acquired immune system can account for the observed linked genomic structure of RAG-1 and RAG-2 in non-vertebrate organisms such as the sea urchin that lack an acquired immune system and V(D)J recombination. Initially the regulated expression of a viral recombinase in immune cells may have been positively selected by its ability to stimulate innate immunity to herpes virus infection rather than V(D)J recombination Unlike the ""RAG-transposon"" hypothesis, the proposed model can be readily tested by comparative functional analysis of herpes virus replication and V(D)J recombination."

We sought to determine the relationship between investment in community health worker (CHW) home visits and increased attendance at cervical cancer screening appointments in Cape Town, South Africa.We conducted an observational study of 5,258 CHW home visits made in 2003-4 as part of a community-based screening program. We estimated the functional relationship between spending on these visits and increased appointment attendance (adherence). Increased adherence was noted after each subsequent CHW visit. The costs of making the CHW visits was based on resource use including both personnel time and vehicle-related expenses valued in 2004 Rand. The CHW program cost R194,018, with 1,576 additional appointments attended. Adherence increased from 74% to 90%; 55% to 87%; 48% to 77%; and 56% to 80% for 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month appointments. Average per-woman costs increased by R14-R47. The majority of this increase occurred with the first 2 CHW visits (90%, 83%, 74%, and 77%; additional cost: R12-R26).We found that study data can be used for program planning, identifying spending levels that achieve adherence targets given budgetary constraints. The results, derived from a single disease program, are retrospective, and should be prospectively replicated."
https://openalex.org/W2070640331,"Background Wnt signaling controls the balance between stem cell proliferation and differentiation and body patterning throughout development. Previous data demonstrated that non-canonical Wnts (Wnt5a, Wnt11) increased cardiac gene expression of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and bone marrow-derived stem cells cultured in vitro. Since previous studies suggested a contribution of the protein kinase C (PKC) family to the Wnt5a-induced signalling, we investigated which PKC isoforms are activated by non-canonical Wnt5a in human EPC. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunoblot experiments demonstrated that Wnt5a selectively activated the novel PKC isoform, PKC delta, as evidenced by phosphorylation and translocation. In contrast, the classical Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms, PKC alpha and beta2, and one of the other novel PKC isoforms, PKC epsilon, were not activated by Wnt5a. The PKC delta inhibitor rottlerin significantly blocked co-culture-induced cardiac differentiation in vitro, whereas inhibitors directed against the classical Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms or a PKC epsilon-inhibitory peptide did not block cardiac differentiation. In accordance, EPC derived from PKC delta heterozygous mice exhibited a significant reduction of Wnt5a-induced cardiac gene expression compared to wild type mice derived EPC. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that Wnt5a enhances cardiac gene expressions of EPC via an activation of PKC delta."

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Shoubridge C. Cloosterman D. Parkinson-Lawerence E. Brooks D. Gécz J.

It is not clear whether or how these putative NLSs function in the nuclear localization of Arx. aristaless-related homeobox amino acids glucocorticoid receptor glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP small interfering RNA nuclear localization sequence classic NLS vitamin D receptor Discosoma sp. red fluorescent protein. As for other trinucleotide-repeat-containing genes (12Orr H.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Cell. 2000; 101: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat.

Expansion of this tract or loss of the 3′ aristaless domain in Arx are both associated with infantile spasms syndrome and mental retardation (14Kato M. Das S. Petras K. Kitamura K. Morohashi K.

Moreover, expansion of the first poly(A) tract of Arx results in formation of nuclear inclusions and an increase in cell death (16Nasrallah I.M. Minarcik J.C. Golden J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). X-linked mental retardation and dystonia are related to expansion in the second poly(A) tract of Arx (8Gécz J. Cloosterman D.

Gehring W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Ploski et al. (19Ploski J.E. Shamsher M.K. Radu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) found that Pax6 has only one NLS which overlaps with its homeodomain. It is recognized by importin 13, which is required for its import and is a member of importin β superfamily (19Ploski J.E. Shamsher M.K. Radu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These authors suggested that most paired-type homeodomain transcription factors including Arx are imported by importin 13 (19Ploski J.E. Shamsher M.K. Radu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, imp13 can interact with Arx. However, whether imp13 is the only receptor responsible for nuclear import of Arx (11Shoubridge C. Cloosterman D. Parkinson-Lawerence E. Brooks D. Gécz J. Genomics. 2007; 90: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) is an open question. Nuclear localization of transcription factors is essential in eukaryotes, and members of the importin β superfamily (importin βs) play key roles in signal-dependent nuclear import and export (20Quan Y.

Cargo binding and release by importin βs are regulated by the asymmetric distribution of RanGTP, which is more concentrated in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm (32Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R436-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Proteins containing classic nuclear localization sequences (cNLS) are imported by the importin α/β heterodimer (26Cook A. Bono F. Jinek M. Conti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 647-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 33Conti E. Müller C.W. Stewart M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), which interacts with short stretches of positively charged amino acids. cNLSs can be monopartite with five basic amino acids or bipartite, with two short basic clusters separated by a spacer (25Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 34Goldfarb D.S. Corbett A.H. Mason D.A. Harreman M.T. Adam S.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 505-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In addition to the cNLS-mediated pathway, importin βs can function in the absence of importin α. In this situation, cargoes use a nonclassical NLS (23Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Known nonclassical NLS lack conserved sequences or structures, and different nonclassical NLS are generally recognized by different importin βs. Many proteins have at least two NLSs. Among these is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (35Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). For the GR, NLS1 is a cNLS which localizes to the C-terminal region of the DNA binding domain (36Cadepond F. Gasc J.M. Delahaye F. Jibard N. Schweizer-Groyer G. Segard-Maurel I. Evans R. Baulieu E.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The second GR NLS (NLS2), a nonclassical NLS, is in the ligand binding domain (35Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). NLS2-mediated import of the GR is slower than import via NLS1 and is hormone-dependent (37Savory J.G. Hsu B. Laquian I.R. Giffin W. Reich T. Haché R.J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It, therefore, is likely to require a structural change that affects NLS1. Recent observations suggest that nuclear import of the GR is accomplished by multiple transport proteins, providing the opportunity for context-specific regulation (38Freedman N.D. Yamamoto K.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2276-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 39Tao T. Lan J. Lukacs G.L. Haché R.J. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 35: 668-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, the exact contribution of import receptor interactions with NLS2 in the context of full-length GR has not yet been elucidated. Importin β1 can transport many cargoes directly as well as cargoes with basic NLSs via importin α and import uridine-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins via snurportin. Importin 9 imports histones and ribosomal proteins (23Pemberton L.F. Paschal B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Importin 13 (imp13, also known as lgl2, IPO13, or Kap13) is one of the few importins that can transport cargoes bi-directionally (40Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Its expression and function are developmentally regulated (41Tao T. Lan J. Presley J.F. Sweezey N.B. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Zhang C. Sweezey N.B. Gagnon S. Muskat B. Koehler D. Post M. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the expression level of imp13 is higher in the brain than in other tissues (41Tao T. Lan J. Presley J.F. Sweezey N.B. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 42Zhang C. Sweezey N.B. Gagnon S. Muskat B. Koehler D. Post M. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Several cargoes of imp13 have been identified: Rbm8, Ubc9 (40Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), Pax6 (19Ploski J.E. Shamsher M.K. Radu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4824-4834Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the NF-YB/NF-YC dimer (44Kahle J. Baake M. Doenecke D. Albig W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5339-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the glucocorticoid receptor (39Tao T. Lan J. Lukacs G.L. Haché R.J. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Cell Biochem. 2008; 307: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). imp13 exports eIF-1A (40Mingot J.M. Kostka S. Kraft R. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3685-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). imp13 plays a role in meiotic differentiation of mouse germ cells by regulating the nuclear import of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (46Yamaguchi Y.L. Tanaka S.S. Yasuda K. Matsui Y. Tam P.P. Dev. Biol. 2006; 297: 350-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). There is a so-called redundancy in terms of multiple importin βs being able to mediate nuclear import of certain proteins. A good example is that of the importin βs binding NLS of ribosomal protein rpL23a, which can be recognized by importin β1, importin β2, importin 5, and importin 7 (47Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Jun can be transported into the nucleus by importin β1, importin β2, importin 7, and importin 9 (48Waldmann I. Wälde S. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27685-27692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study two functional NLS domains of Arx have been characterized. Nuclear import of Arx via NLS2, which largely overlaps with the homeobox domain, is mediated by multiple pathways including imporin β1, importin 9, and importin 13, with importin β1 playing the major role. Moreover, nuclear import of Arx via importin β1 is not enhanced by the addition of either importin 9 or importin 13. Yet-unidentified factors, therefore, may influence the choice of nuclear import pathway of Arx. All expression vectors were constructed by integrating specific PCR products into different expression vectors. All PCR reactions for ARX mutation were done with the Takara LA Taq with GC buffer (#DRR20AG, Takara, Japan), and restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were purchased from Takara Co., Japan. The sequences of primers and the description of plasmids are summarized as supplemental materials. All plasmids were sequence-verified. Schematic diagrams of the ARX mutants are shown in Figs. 2A and 7A.FIGURE 7The R382A mutation in NLS2 abolishes its function in Arx by blocking its interaction with impβ1. Most positively charged amino acids in the homeobox were substituted by alanine residues as shown in panel A. These mutants tagged with EGFP were transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells. As shown in panel B, mutations K327A, R328A, K329A, R331A, R332A, and R334A in the BC1 domain (a–f) did not mislocalize ΔNLS1-Arx. These mutants are still in the nuclei. By contrast, mutations R381A, R382A, and R386A in the BC2 domain of (g, h, and j) mislocalized ΔNLS1-Arx into the cytoplasm of most cells. Mutant K384A still shows a dominant nuclear location of Arx (i). Statistical data of these experiments is summarized in panel C. Among these mutants, mutant R382A showed that about 60% of transfected cells had only cytoplasmic signal, and more than 30% of R382A mutant-expressing cells had both cytoplasmic and nuclear Arx. By contrast, cells expressing ΔNLS1-Arx show only nuclear signal, suggesting that arginine 382 is an important residue for NLS2 function. In panel D, most substitution mutants of positively charged amino acids in the homeobox were expressed with an EGFP tag, and lysates were used to test their interactions with GST-tagged impβ1. Bound Arx and its mutants were detected by an anti-EGFP antibody. As shown, mutants R328A, K329A, R331A, R332A, and R334A in the BC1 domain still show significant bindings to impβ1, in comparison with the binding of ΔNLS2-Arx to impβ1. In panel E, each of R381A, R382A, K384A, and R386A in the BC2 domain in the homeobox was expressed, and lysates were used to test their interactions with GST-tagged impβ1, imp9, and imp13. As shown, mutants of R381A, R382A, or R386A show modest binding to impβ1 and show reduced interactions with imp9 and imp13. Note that mutant K384A shows significant interactions with impβ1, imp9, and imp13.

A pair of primers for the PCR reaction was designed to overlap with each other to create a substitution of arginine or lysine with an alanine residue at specific sites (supplemental materials). The total volume for PCR reaction was 20 μl. The extension time is 8 min, and 14 cycles were set for each mutagenesis reaction. After PCR, 0.5 μl of DpnI (New England Biolabs) and 2.2 μl of its buffer were added to the reaction mixture, and then these mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. The mixtures were then transfected into DH5α competent cells and screened for correct mutants by sequencing. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells grown on 100-mm plates were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% proteinase inhibitor mixture (#P8340, Sigma)) and lysed on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. The mixture was spun at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected for GST pulldown assays or Western blotting. Both GST-tagged impβ1, imp4, imp9, and imp13 and Arx-His6 were overexpressed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in bacteria. Cells expressing GST-tagged proteins were sonicated in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and the supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The purified Arx-His6 and lysates of cells expressing EGFP-tagged Arx and its mutants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads saturated with either impβ1, imp4, imp9, and imp13-GST or GST for 3 h at 4 °C. Washed beads were mixed with protein loading buffer and boiled for SDS-PAGE-Western blotting. About 3% of each input and 50% of each bound sample were loaded for each Western blotting analysis. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (49Yasuhara N. Takeda E. Inoue H. Kotera I. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 297: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, extracts from transfected cells were prepared with Nonidet P-40-containing transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitor mixture of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40). About 5 × 106 cells were suspended in 200 μl of buffer. Samples were precleared by incubation with protein G-plus-agarose beads (#sc2002, Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 1 h and then incubated with 1 μg of a monoclonal antibody against GFP (#ab1218, Abcam Co.) with 20 μl of protein G-plus-agarose at 4 °C for 4 h. Agarose beads were washed with transport buffer and suspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed subsequently by Western blotting. Endogenous impβ1, imp9, and imp13 in the precipitated complex were detected by an anti-impβ1 antibody (#ab2811, Abcam), anti-imp9 antibody (#ab52605, Abcam), and anti-imp13 antibody (39Tao T. Lan J. Lukacs G.L. Haché R.J. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2006; 35: 668-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), respectively. About 10% of each input and 25% of each bound sample were loaded for each Western blotting analysis. Wild-type Ran-GST and RanQ69L-GST were expressed in DH5α cells using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Bacterial cell lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, which were then subjected to cleavage with thrombin in 200 μl of binding buffer, followed by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 2 mm GDP and 2 mm GTP were incubated with purified Ran and RanQ69L, respectively, in the presence of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.3), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 2 h at room temperature. impβ1-GST, imp4-GST, imp9-GST, and imp13-GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed with the binding buffer and then incubated with bacterial lysates containing Arx-His6 in the binding buffer at 4 °C for 4 h. Supernatants were removed, and beads were washed with the binding buffer. Then beads were separated into three equal parts, which were incubated with RanGDP, RanQ69LGTP, or the control buffer only at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by the Western blot with an anti-His6 antibody. About 10% of each input and 50% of each bound sample were loaded for each Western blotting analysis. Briefly, HeLa cells were grown on 10-mm glass coverslips to 40–80% confluence. Permeabilization was done with 40 μg/ml digitonin (#D5628, Sigma) for 5 min on ice. The permeabilized cells were incubated for 30 min at 30 or 4 °C with 25 μl of a transport reaction mix consisting of cargo (1 μm) and recombinant importin βs (1 μm) in transport buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.3), 110 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 250 mm sucrose) supplemented with an energy regenerating system (0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase and 3 μm Ran (GDP)). The import reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of transport buffer. Cells were fixed by using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice. For negative controls, the assay was done in the absence of recombinant transport factors. Cells were visualized by a Leica confocal microscope (model SPII AOBS). The coding regions for the His6-tag fusion proteins were cloned as follows; murine Arx and R382A/ΔNLS1-Arx were inserted at BamHI/HindIII sites of pET28a vector, and then an EGFP fragment was inserted at HindIII/XhoI sites. A DNA sequence encoding the fragment of vitamin D receptor (aa 4–232) (VDR) was inserted into the vector pGEX4T-2-EGFP to express a truncated VDR tagged with both GST and EGFP. This purified protein was used as a positive control for the activity of imp4 (50Miyauchi Y. Michigami T. Sakaguchi N. Sekimoto T. Yoneda Y. Pike J.W. Yamagata M. Ozono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40901-40908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In all experiments, a minimum of 25 cells was analyzed for each determination in each of three experiments. The kinetic assay was followed as previously described (41Tao T. Lan J. Presley J.F. Sweezey N.B. Kaplan F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 51Ribbeck K. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). In brief, purified ΔNLS1-Arx-His6-EGFP (1 μm) was added to digitonin-permeabilized cells as the transport cargo along with purified impβ1 (1 μm), imp9 (1 μm), imp13 (1 μm), or mixtures of these importins. The influx of the cargo into nuclei was recorded in real time by a Leica confocal microscope (model SPII AOBS). A series of images was then acquired (5-s intervals) to visualize nuclear fluorescence (excluding the signal at the perimeter of the nucleus). Nuclear fluorescence was quantitated using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Background values from outside the cell were subtracted. Values of nuclear fluorescence were calculated by averaging fluorescence values from three random areas in each nucleus. In all assays at least five nuclei were analyzed for each determination in each of three experiments. The value of nuclear fluorescence at the point of 250 s after the addition of cargoes was used as 100%. Half-times for nuclear accumulation of cargoes were determined when nuclear fluorescence reached to 50% that of the 250-s point of nuclear import. Import was performed at 20 °C in the transport buffer. Cells of N2a (a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, kindly provided by Dr. Huaxi Xu from the Burnham Institute), NIH3T3, HeLa, and 293T were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) plus 10% de-complemented fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, air incubator. For microscopic examination, cells on glass coverslips (12 mm) were usually seeded at 5.0 × 104 cells/coverslip the day before transfection. Plasmid DNA (0.5 μg/coverslip) was transfected into cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 kit (#11668-019′Invitrogen). Subcellular distributions of Arx and its mutants were documented by either a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence microscope or a Leica confocal microscope (model SPII AOBS). In all experiments a minimum of 25 cells was analyzed for each determination in each of three experiments. For preparation of cell lysates, cells were usually seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm plate the day before transfection. 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA/plate were transfected into cells. Transfected cells were lysed for further analysis after 24 h. Coverslips of adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min on ice and then quenched and permeabilized with 0.1 m glycine (pH 7.0), 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer saline (52Tao T. Tartakoff A.M. Traffic. 2001; 2: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These coverslips were stained with an an"
https://openalex.org/W2076087427,"Experiments dating back to the 1940's have led to the hypothesis that the brain is an immunologically privileged site, shielding its antigens from immune recognition. The paraneoplastic Hu syndrome provides a powerful paradigm for addressing this hypothesis; it is believed to develop because small cell lung cancers (SCLC) express the neuron-specific Hu protein. This leads to an Hu-specific tumor immune response that can develop into an autoimmune attack against neurons, presumably when immune privilege in the brain is breached. Interestingly, all SCLC express the onconeural HuD antigen, and clinically useful tumor immune responses can be detected in up to 20% of patients, yet the paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome is extremely rare. We found that HuD-specific CD8+ T cells are normally present in the mouse T cell repertoire, but are not expanded upon immunization, although they can be detected after in vitro expansion. In contrast, HuD-specific T cells could be directly activated in HuD null mice, without the need for in vitro expansion. Taken together, these results demonstrate robust tolerance to the neuronal HuD antigen in vivo, and suggest a re-evaluation of the current concept of immune privilege in the brain."

Because prostate development begins in late gestation and continues postnatally, we overcame embryonic lethality to study the role of Klf6 in prostate development and tumorigenesis by generating a prostate-specific deletion of the Klf6 gene using a Cre-lox recombination approach. We report here a novel role for Klf6 in the regulation of Shh-mediated epithelial branching morphogenesis in the anterior prostate.DISCUSSIONThe Klf gene family is known to be crucial for development in vertebrates (4Oates A.C.

They are expressed in a large number of tissues (40Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biochem.

Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Using the prostate as a model, we describe here for the first time a role for Klf6 in prostate branching morphogenesis. Consistent with this notion, Klf14, another Klf family member, has been shown to be critical for alveolarization in the developing lung. Deletion of Klf14 leads to thinner lung alveolar walls and poor outgrowth of secondary septa, which results in defective blood-air exchange and respiratory failures in newborn mice (43Hertveldt V. Louryan S. van Reeth T. Drèze P. van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the kidney, Klf6 is known to be expressed in the Wolffian duct, uteric bud, collecting ducts, and mesangium (44Fischer E.A. Verpont M.C. Garrett-Sinha L.A. Ronco P.M. Rossert J.A. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 726-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an expression profile that would also be consistent with a role in branching morphogenesis.Because systemic loss of Klf6 is embryonic lethal (23Matsumoto N. Kubo A. Liu H. Akita K. Laub F. Ramirez F. Keller G. Friedman S.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we generated mice deficient for Klf6 specifically in the prostate. The resulting lateral branching defect in Klf6-deficient prostate was confirmed by light microscopy, H&E staining, and micro-CT imaging. Using a novel ex vivo ultrasound imaging modality, we were able to demonstrate that Klf6 plays a role in modulating the epithelial infolding and tufting, which results in decreased surface area of functional epithelium. The most prominent branching defects are seen in the anterior prostate, also known as a coagulating gland, which correlates with the highest level of Klf6 depletion (Fig. 1E). Despite the reduction in epithelial infolding and tufting whether or not prostatic function has been impaired in these mice remains to be determined.The augmented branching defect in the anterior prostate is noteworthy, because the branching patterns in the anterior prostate are distinct from the dorsolateral prostate and ventral prostate. In addition, the embryologic origin of the anterior prostate is also different from the other prostate lobes (45Cunha G.R. Lung B. Accesory Glands of Male Reproductive Tract. 6. Ann Arbor Science, Ann Arbor, MI1979: 1-28Google Scholar, 46Cunha G.R. Alarid E.T. Turner T. Donjacour A.A. Boutin E.L. Foster B.A. J. Androl. 1992; 13: 465-475PubMed Google Scholar). Although branching patterns of the ventral prostate and dorsolateral prostates are believed to arise from the urogenital sinus epithelium invaginating into urogenital sinus mesenchyme, the anterior prostate is thought to be derived from urogenital sinus epithelium at the most dorsal aspect of the urogenital sinus invaginating into the mesenchyme of the seminal vesicle, which itself is derived from the mesodermal Wolffian duct. Hence, the resulting branched structure in the anterior prostate has unique patterns distinct from the other prostate lobes and occurs as a result of lateral branch events and not as a result of bifurcations at the elongating tips.Consistent with previous reports from our group and others on the role of Shh signaling in prostate branching (12Freestone S.H.

Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), both Ptc-lacZ reporter mice crossed to Klf6f/fNkx3.1Cre/+ mice and in situ hybridization data in the present study indicate that impaired lateral branching in the Klf6-deficient prostate correlate with an up-regulation and loss of spatial localization of Shh, Ptc, and Gli1. Further support for the involvement of focal Hh signaling in prostate epithelial branching comes from a study by Bushman and co-workers (15Lamm M.L. Catbagan W.S. Laciak R.J. Barnett D.H. Hebner C.M. Gaffield W. Walterhouse D. Iannaccone P. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), showing a close association between prostate ductal bud formation and localized expression of Shh at the growing tips of elongating prostate ducts. In addition, Shh regulates prostate branching morphogenesis in concert with FGF10 and BMP4 (37Pu Y. Huang L. Prins G.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Shh secreted from the epithelial ductal tips can down-regulate FGF10 that stimulates epithelial cell growth (16Thomson A.A. Cunha G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 3693-3701PubMed Google Scholar) and/or up-regulate BMP4 that inhibits epithelial cell growth (17Lamm M.L. Podlasek C.A. Barnett D.H. Lee J. Clemens J.Q. Hebner C.M. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in the mesenchyme, which results in epithelial ductal branching (37Pu Y. Huang L. Prins G.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that loss of Klf6 leads to dispersed, rather than focal, Shh expression throughout the epithelial ducts and corresponding dispersed Ptc and Gli1 expression in the adjacent mesenchyme (Fig. 5). This broader domain of Hh pathway activity leads to an up-regulation of BMP4 expression, resulting in reduced ductal branching. As proposed by Pu and coworkers, the interplay and localized expression pattern of Shh and BMP4 are key to conveying critical branching information (37Pu Y. Huang L. Prins G.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Klf6 is reported to be a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a large subset of prostate cancer (47Narla G. Friedman S.L. Martignetti J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1047-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, our detailed histological characterization of Klf6f/fNkx3.1+/+ mice as old as 2 years failed to reveal any prostate tumors. 7C. C. Leow, B. Wang, J. Ross, S. M. Chan, J. Zha, R. A. D. Carano, G. Frantz, M. M. Shen, F. J. de Sauvage, and W.-Q. Gao, unpublished observations. The lack of tumor phenotype in the Klf6 mutant mice could be due to compensations/redundancy with other Klf family members. It is also possible that loss of Klf6 might not be sufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis in the mouse and that loss/mutation of additional tumor suppressors might be required. Klf6 belongs to the family of Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (1Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Because prostate development begins in late gestation and continues postnatally, we overcame embryonic lethality to study the role of Klf6 in prostate development and tumorigenesis by generating a prostate-specific deletion of the Klf6 gene using a Cre-lox recombination approach. We report here a novel role for Klf6 in the regulation of Shh-mediated epithelial branching morphogenesis in the anterior prostate.

Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Using the prostate as a model, we describe here for the first time a role for Klf6 in prostate branching morphogenesis. Consistent with this notion, Klf14, another Klf family member, has been shown to be critical for alveolarization in the developing lung. Deletion of Klf14 leads to thinner lung alveolar walls and poor outgrowth of secondary septa, which results in defective blood-air exchange and respiratory failures in newborn mice (43Hertveldt V. Louryan S. van Reeth T. Drèze P. van Vooren P. Szpirer J. Szpirer C. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 883-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the kidney, Klf6 is known to be expressed in the Wolffian duct, uteric bud, collecting ducts, and mesangium (44Fischer E.A. Verpont M.C. Garrett-Sinha L.A. Ronco P.M. Rossert J.A. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 726-735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an expression profile that would also be consistent with a role in branching morphogenesis.Because systemic loss of Klf6 is embryonic lethal (23Matsumoto N. Kubo A. Liu H. Akita K. Laub F. Ramirez F. Keller G. Friedman S.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we generated mice deficient for Klf6 specifically in the prostate. The resulting lateral branching defect in Klf6-deficient prostate was confirmed by light microscopy, H&E staining, and micro-CT imaging. Using a novel ex vivo ultrasound imaging modality, we were able to demonstrate that Klf6 plays a role in modulating the epithelial infolding and tufting, which results in decreased surface area of functional epithelium. The most prominent branching defects are seen in the anterior prostate, also known as a coagulating gland, which correlates with the highest level of Klf6 depletion (Fig. 1E). Despite the reduction in epithelial infolding and tufting whether or not prostatic function has been impaired in these mice remains to be determined.The augmented branching defect in the anterior prostate is noteworthy, because the branching patterns in the anterior prostate are distinct from the dorsolateral prostate and ventral prostate. In addition, the embryologic origin of the anterior prostate is also different from the other prostate lobes (45Cunha G.R. Lung B. Accesory Glands of Male Reproductive Tract. 6. Ann Arbor Science, Ann Arbor, MI1979: 1-28Google Scholar, 46Cunha G.R. Alarid E.T. Turner T. Donjacour A.A. Boutin E.L. Foster B.A. J. Androl. 1992; 13: 465-475PubMed Google Scholar). Although branching patterns of the ventral prostate and dorsolateral prostates are believed to arise from the urogenital sinus epithelium invaginating into urogenital sinus mesenchyme, the anterior prostate is thought to be derived from urogenital sinus epithelium at the most dorsal aspect of the urogenital sinus invaginating into the mesenchyme of the seminal vesicle, which itself is derived from the mesodermal Wolffian duct. Hence, the resulting branched structure in the anterior prostate has unique patterns distinct from the other prostate lobes and occurs as a result of lateral branch events and not as a result of bifurcations at the elongating tips.Consistent with previous reports from our group and others on the role of Shh signaling in prostate branching (12Freestone S.H.

Further support for the involvement of focal Hh signaling in prostate epithelial branching comes from a study by Bushman and co-workers (15Lamm M.L. Catbagan W.S. Laciak R.J. Barnett D.H. Hebner C.M. Gaffield W. Walterhouse D. Iannaccone P. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), showing a close association between prostate ductal bud formation and localized expression of Shh at the growing tips of elongating prostate ducts. In addition, Shh regulates prostate branching morphogenesis in concert with FGF10 and BMP4 (37Pu Y. Huang L. Prins G.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Shh secreted from the epithelial ductal tips can down-regulate FGF10 that stimulates epithelial cell growth (16Thomson A.A. Cunha G.R. Development. 1999; 126: 3693-3701PubMed Google Scholar) and/or up-regulate BMP4 that inhibits epithelial cell growth (17Lamm M.L. Podlasek C.A. Barnett D.H. Lee J. Clemens J.Q. Hebner C.M. Bushman W.

Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that loss of Klf6 leads to dispersed, rather than focal, Shh expression throughout the epithelial ducts and corresponding dispersed Ptc and Gli1 expression in the adjacent mesenchyme (Fig. 5). This broader domain of Hh pathway activity leads to an up-regulation of BMP4 expression, resulting in reduced ductal branching. As proposed by Pu and coworkers, the interplay and localized expression pattern of Shh and BMP4 are key to conveying critical branching information (37Pu Y. Huang L. Prins G.S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 273: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).Klf6 is reported to be a tumor suppressor that is inactivated in a large subset of prostate cancer (47Narla G. Friedman S.L.

The lack of tumor phenotype in the Klf6 mutant mice could be due to compensations/redundancy with other Klf family members. It is also possible that loss of Klf6 might not be sufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis in the mouse and that loss/mutation of additional tumor suppressors might be required.

https://openalex.org/W2144314600,"Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) allows plants to block fertilization by haploid pollen whose S-allele constitution matches one of the two S-alleles in the diploid styles. GSI in Solanum chacoense requires a stylar S-RNase, first secreted from cells of the transmitting tract then imported into incompatible (self) pollen tubes. However, the molecular mechanisms allowing compatible pollen to evade S-RNase attack are less clear, as compatible pollen tubes also import S-RNase. Using styles of the same age and size in order to lower the degree of inter-style variability in S-RNase levels, we observe reduction of up to 30% of the total non-self stylar S-RNase in vivo during compatible crosses, whereas no degradation of self S-RNases is detected. This marked difference in stylar S-RNase levels dovetails with measurements of pollen-specific Lat52 mRNA, which decreases four-fold in incompatible compared to compatible crosses. Unexpectedly, we also find evidence for a reciprocal signaling mechanism from compatible pollen to the cells of the transmitting tract that results in a roughly three-fold decrease in S-RNase transcript levels. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected feedback loop that may help reinforce the compatible reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1996318010,"Our motor actions are sometimes not properly performed despite our having complete understanding of the environmental situation with a suitable action intention. In most cases, insufficient skill for motor control can explain the improper performance. A notable exception is the action of stepping onto a stopped escalator, which causes clumsy movements accompanied by an odd sensation. Previous studies have examined short-term sensorimotor adaptations to treadmills and moving sleds, but the relationship between the odd sensation and behavioral properties in a real stopped-escalator situation has never been examined. Understanding this unique action-perception linkage would help us to assess the brain function connecting automatic motor controls and the conscious awareness of action. Here we directly pose a question: Does the odd sensation emerge because of the unfamiliar motor behavior itself toward the irregular step-height of a stopped escalator or as a consequence of an automatic habitual motor program cued by the escalator itself. We compared the properties of motor behavior toward a stopped escalator (SE) with those toward moving escalator and toward a wooden stairs (WS) that mimicked the stopped escalator, and analyzed the subjective feeling of the odd sensation in the SE and WS conditions. The results show that moving escalator-specific motor actions emerged after participants had stepped onto the stopped escalator despite their full awareness that it was stopped, as if the motor behavior was guided by a “phantom” of a moving escalator. Additionally, statistical analysis reveals that postural forward sway that occurred after the stepping action is directly linked with the odd sensation. The results suggest a dissociation between conscious awareness and subconscious motor control: the former makes us perfectly aware of the current environmental situation, but the latter automatically emerges as a result of highly habituated visual input no matter how unsuitable the motor control is. This dissociation appears to yield an attribution conflict, resulting in the odd sensation."
https://openalex.org/W2123200713,"Background The availability of the P. falciparum genome has led to novel ways to identify potential vaccine candidates. A new approach for antigen discovery based on the bioinformatic selection of heptad repeat motifs corresponding to α-helical coiled coil structures yielded promising results. To elucidate the question about the relationship between the coiled coil motifs and their sequence conservation, we have assessed the extent of polymorphism in putative α-helical coiled coil domains in culture strains, in natural populations and in the single nucleotide polymorphism data available at PlasmoDB. Methodology/Principal Findings 14 α-helical coiled coil domains were selected based on preclinical experimental evaluation. They were tested by PCR amplification and sequencing of different P. falciparum culture strains and field isolates. We found that only 3 out of 14 α-helical coiled coils showed point mutations and/or length polymorphisms. Based on promising immunological results 5 of these peptides were selected for further analysis. Direct sequencing of field samples from Papua New Guinea and Tanzania showed that 3 out of these 5 peptides were completely conserved. An in silico analysis of polymorphism was performed for all 166 putative α-helical coiled coil domains originally identified in the P. falciparum genome. We found that 82% (137/166) of these peptides were conserved, and for one peptide only the detected SNPs decreased substantially the probability score for α-helical coiled coil formation. More SNPs were found in arrays of almost perfect tandem repeats. In summary, the coiled coil structure prediction was rarely modified by SNPs. The analysis revealed a number of peptides with strictly conserved α-helical coiled coil motifs. Conclusion/Significance We conclude that the selection of α-helical coiled coil structural motifs is a valuable approach to identify potential vaccine targets showing a high degree of conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2070346075,"Overexpression of the transcription factor Spi-1/PU.1 by transgenesis in mice induces a maturation arrest at the proerythroblastic stage of differentiation. We have previously isolated a panel of spi-1 transgenic erythroleukemic cell lines that proliferated in the presence of either erythropoietin (Epo) or stem cell factor (SCF). Using these cell lines, we observed that EpoR stimulation by Epo down-regulated expression of the SCF receptor Kit and induced expression of the Src kinase Lyn. Furthermore, enforced expression of Lyn in the cell lines increased cell proliferation in response to Epo, but reduced cell growth in response to SCF in accordance with Lyn ability to down-regulate Kit expression. Together, the data suggest that Epo-R/Lyn signaling pathway is essential for extinction of SCF signaling leading the proerythroblast to strict Epo dependency. These results highlight a new role for Lyn as an effector of EpoR in controlling Kit expression. They suggest that Lyn may play a central role in during erythroid differentiation at the switch between proliferation and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2017164427,"Many agents that activate hematopoietic cells use phos pha tidyl ino si tol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns 3,4,5-P(3)) to initiate signaling cascades. The SH2 domain-containing inositol 5' phosphatase, SHIP1, regulates hematopoietic cell function by opposing the action of phos pha tidyl ino si tol 3-kinase and reducing the levels of PtdIns 3,4,5-P(3). Activation of the cyclic AMP-de pend ent protein kinase (PKA) also opposes many of the pro-inflammatory responses of hematopoietic cells. We tested to see whether the activity of SHIP1 was regulated via phos pho ryl a tion with PKA. We prepared pure recombinant SHIP1 from HEK-293 cells and found it can be rapidly phos pho ryl a ted by PKA to a stoichiometry of 0.6 mol of PO(4)/mol of SHIP1. In (32)P-labeled HEK-293 cells transfected with SHIP1, stimulation with Sp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethylammonium salt hydrate (Sp-cAMPS) or activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor increased the phos pho ryl a tion state of SHIP1. Inhibition of protein phosphatase activity with okadaic acid also increased the phos pho ryl a tion of SHIP1. Phosphorylation of SHIP1 in vitro or in cells by PKA increased the 5' phosphatase activity of SHIP1 by 2-3-fold. Elevation of Ca(2+) in DT40 cells in response to B cell receptor cross-linking, an indicator of PtdIns 3,4,5-P(3) levels, was markedly blunted by pretreatment with Sp-cAMPS. This effect was absent in SHIP(-/-) DT40 cells showing that the effect of Sp-cAMPS in DT40 cells is SHIP1-de pend ent. Sp-cAMPS also blunted the ability of the B cell receptor to increase the phos pho ryl a tion of Akt in DT40 and A20 cells. Overall, activation of G protein-coupled receptors that raise cyclic AMP cause SHIP1 to be phosphorylated and stimulate its inositol phosphatase activity. These results outline a novel mechanism of SHIP1 regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1993725573,"Bacterial pathogens employ a variety of survival strategies when they invade eukaryotic cells. The amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is used as a model host to study the pathogenic mechanisms that Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaire's disease, uses to kill eukaryotic cells. Here we show that the infection of D. discoideum by L. pneumophila results in a decrease in mitochondrial messenger RNAs, beginning more than 8 hours prior to detectable host cell death. These changes can be mimicked by hydrogen peroxide treatment, but not by other cytotoxic agents. The mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) is also cleaved at three specific sites during the course of infection. Two LSU rRNA fragments appear first, followed by smaller fragments produced by additional cleavage events. The initial LSU rRNA cleavage site is predicted to be on the surface of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, while two secondary sites map to the predicted interface with the small subunit. No LSU rRNA cleavage was observed after exposure of D. discoideum to hydrogen peroxide, or other cytotoxic chemicals that kill cells in a variety of ways. Functional L. pneumophila type II and type IV secretion systems are required for the cleavage, establishing a correlation between the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila and D. discoideum LSU rRNA destruction. LSU rRNA cleavage was not observed in L. pneumophila infections of Acanthamoeba castellanii or human U937 cells, suggesting that L. pneumophila uses distinct mechanisms to interrupt metabolism in different hosts. Thus, L. pneumophila infection of D. discoideum results in dramatic decrease of mitochondrial RNAs, and in the specific cleavage of mitochondrial rRNA. The predicted location of the cleavage sites on the mitochondrial ribosome suggests that rRNA destruction is initiated by a specific sequence of events. These findings suggest that L. pneumophila specifically disrupts mitochondrial protein synthesis in D. discoideum during the course of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1970327846,"In a recent publication we described a microscopical technique called Ultramicroscopy, combined with a histological procedure that makes biological samples transparent. With this combination we can gather three-dimensional image data of large biological samples. Here we present the theoretical analysis of the z-resolution. By analyzing the cross-section of the illuminating sheet of light we derive resolution values according to the Rayleigh-criterion. Next we investigate the resolution adjacent to the focal point of the illumination beam, analyze throughout what extend the illumination beam is of acceptable sharpness and investigate the resolution improvements caused by the objective lens. Finally we conclude with a useful rule for the sampling rates. These findings are of practical importance for researchers working with Ultramicroscopy to decide on adequate sampling rates. They are also necessary to modify deconvolution techniques to gain further image improvements."
https://openalex.org/W1983518877,"Proteases play a central role in cellular homeostasis and are responsible for the spatio-temporal regulation of function. Many putative proteases have been recently identified through genomic approaches, leading to a surge in global profiling attempts to characterize their function. Through such efforts and others it has become evident that many proteases play non-traditional roles. Accordingly, the number and the variety of the substrate repertoire of proteases are expected to be much larger than previously assumed. In line with such global profiling attempts, we present here a method for the prediction of natural substrates of endo proteases (human proteases used as an example) by employing short peptide sequences as specificity determinants.Our method incorporates specificity determinants unique to individual enzymes and physiologically relevant dual filters namely, solvent accessible surface area--a parameter dependent on protein three-dimensional structure and subcellular localization. By incorporating such hitherto unused principles in prediction methods, a novel ligand docking strategy to mimic substrate binding at the active site of the enzyme, and GO functions, we identify and perform subjective validation on putative substrates of matriptase and highlight new functions of the enzyme. Using relative solvent accessibility to rank order we show how new protease regulatory networks and enzyme cascades can be created.We believe that our physiologically relevant computational approach would be a very useful complementary method in the current day attempts to profile proteases (endo proteases in particular) and their substrates. In addition, by using functional annotations, we have demonstrated how normal and unknown functions of a protease can be envisaged. We have developed a network which can be integrated to create a proteolytic world. This network can in turn be extended to integrate other regulatory networks to build a system wide knowledge of the proteome."
https://openalex.org/W2070348225,"Background Filaggrin is a major protein in the epidermis. Several mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) have been associated with a number of conditions. Filaggrin is expressed in the tympanic membrane and could alter its mechanical properties, but the relationship between genetic variation in FLG and hearing has not yet been tested. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined whether loss-of function mutations R501X and 2282del4 in the FLG gene affected hearing in children. Twenty eight hearing variables representing five different aspects of hearing at age nine years in 5,377 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort were tested for association with these mutations. No evidence of association was found between R501X or 2282del4 (or overall FLG mutation carrier status) and any of the hearing phenotypes analysed. Conclusions/Significance In conclusion, carrier status for common filaggrin mutations does not affect hearing in children."
https://openalex.org/W2091153948,"Prestin, encoded by the gene SLC26A5, is a transmembrane protein of the cochlear outer hair cell (OHC). Prestin is required for the somatic electromotile activity of OHCs, which is absent in OHCs and causes severe hearing impairment in mice lacking prestin. In humans, the role of sequence variations in SLC26A5 in hearing loss is less clear. Although prestin is expected to be required for functional human OHCs, the clinical significance of reported putative mutant alleles in humans is uncertain.To explore the hypothesis that SLC26A5 may act as a modifier gene, affecting the severity of hearing loss caused by an independent etiology, a patient-control cohort was screened for DNA sequence variations in SLC26A5 using sequencing and allele specific methods. Patients in this study carried known pathogenic or controversial sequence variations in GJB2, encoding Connexin 26, or confirmed or suspected sequence variations in SLC26A5; controls included four ethnic populations. Twenty-three different DNA sequence variations in SLC26A5, 14 of which are novel, were observed: 4 novel sequence variations were found exclusively among patients; 7 novel sequence variations were found exclusively among controls; and, 12 sequence variations, 3 of which are novel, were found in both patients and controls. Twenty-one of the 23 DNA sequence variations were located in non-coding regions of SLC26A5. Two coding sequence variations, both novel, were observed only in patients and predict a silent change, p.S434S, and an amino acid substitution, p.I663V. In silico analysis of the p.I663V amino acid variation suggested this variant might be benign. Using Fisher's exact test, no statistically significant difference was observed between patients and controls in the frequency of the identified DNA sequence variations. Haplotype analysis using HaploView 4.0 software revealed the same predominant haplotype in patients and controls and derived haplotype blocks in the patient-control cohort similar to those generated from the International HapMap Project.Although these data fail to support a hypothesis that SLC26A5 acts as a modifier gene of GJB2-related hearing loss, the sample size is small and investigation of a larger population might be more informative. The 14 novel DNA sequence variations in SLC26A5 reported here will serve as useful research tools for future studies of prestin."
