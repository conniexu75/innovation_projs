We have identified and cloned a fourth member of this family (HuR) that is expressed in a wide variety of cell types. The purified recombinant protein binds avidly to the AU-rich element in c-fos and interleukin-3 mRNAs. In the case of the c-fos AU-rich element, HuR binds to a core element of 27 nucleotides that contain AUUUA, AUUUUA, and AUUUUUA motifs. Mutational analysis has shown that all three AU motifs are required for maximal binding.

The new receptor consists of five functional domains resembling the low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptors. LDL receptor deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human apoER2 bound apoE rich β-migrating VLDL with high affinity and internalized. LDL was bound with much lower affinity to these cells. The 4.5- and 8.5-kb mRNAs for the receptor were most highly expressed in human brain and placenta. In rabbit tissues, multiple species of the mRNA with 4, 4.5, 5.5, 8.5, and 11 kb were detected most intensely in brain and testis and, to a much lesser extent, in ovary, but were undetectable in other tissues. In rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, the receptor mRNA was induced by treatment of the cells with nerve growth factor. The receptor transcripts were detectable most intensely in the cerebellar cortex, choroid plexus, ependyma, hippocampus, olfactory bulb and, to a much lesser extent, in the cerebral cortex as revealed by in situ hybridization histochemistry. In the cerebellar cortex, the receptor transcripts were densely deposited in Purkinje cell somata.

https://openalex.org/W2064235474,"Nucleotide excision repair consists of removal of the damaged nucleotide(s) from DNA by dual incision of the damaged strand on both sides of the lesion, followed by filling of the resulting gap and ligation. In humans, 14-16 polypeptides are required for the dual incision step. We have purified the required proteins to homogeneity and reconstituted the dual incision activity (excision nuclease) in a defined enzyme/substrate system. The system was highly efficient, removing >30% of the thymine dimers under optimal conditions. All of the six fractions that constitute the excision nuclease were required for dual incision of the thymine dimer substrate. However, when a cholesterol-substituted oligonucleotide was used as substrate, excision occurred in the absence of the XPC-HHR23B complex, reminiscent of transcription-coupled repair in the XP-C mutant cell line. Replication protein A is absolutely required for both incisions. The XPG subunit is essential to the formation of the preincision complex, but the repair complex can assemble and produce normal levels of 3′-incision in the absence of XPF-ERCC1. Kinetic experiments revealed that the 3′-incision precedes the 5′-incision. Consistent with the kinetic data, uncoupled 5′-incision was never observed in the reconstituted system. Two forms of TFIIH were used in the reconstitution reaction, one containing the CDK7-cyclin H pair and one lacking it. Both forms were equally active in excision. The excised oligomer dissociated from the gapped DNA in a nucleoprotein complex. In total, these results provide a detailed account of the reactions occurring during damage removal by human excision nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W2075750487,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB, contains at least three distinct protein binding domains. The A/B pocket binds proteins with the LXCXE motif, the C pocket binds the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase, and the large A/B pocket binds the transcription factor E2F. Dissociation of RB from its targets is observed as RB becomes phosphorylated during G1/S progression. There are 16 Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites in RB. It was previously unknown whether the many phosphorylation sites had redundant or distinct functions in the regulation of RB. Using RB mutant proteins lacking specific phosphorylation sites, we show that each of the binding domains is inhibited by different sites. Thr-821/826 phosphorylation is required to inhibit the binding to LXCXE containing proteins. Mutation of these two sites does not interfere with the hyperphosphorylation of RB. However, this phosphorylated mutant retains the ability to bind T-Ag, E7, and Elf-1, all of which contain the LXCXE motif. In contrast, Ser-807/811 phosphorylation is required to disrupt c-Abl binding. Mutation of Ser-807/811 and Thr-821/826 does not abolish the regulation of E2F binding.

Taken together, these results show that the protein binding domains of RB are each regulated by distinct Cdk phosphorylation sites. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, Rb-1, was cloned on the basis of its biallelic inactivation in human retinoblastomas(1.Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Google Scholar, 2.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). Rb-1 was subsequently observed to be mutated in a variety of tumor types, indicating that it may play a general role in the inhibition of the transformed phenotype(3.Horowitz J.M. Yandell D.W. Park S.-H. Canning S. Whyte P. Buchkovick K. Harlow E. Weinberg R.A. Dryja T.P. Science. 1989; 243: 937-940Google Scholar, 4.Hansen M.F. Morgan R. Sandberg A.A. Cavenee W.K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1990; 49: 15-23Google Scholar). Reintroduction of Rb-1 into some Rb-/- cells can lead to decreased tumorigenicity in nude mice or inhibition of growth in culture(5.Zacksenhaus E. Bremner R. Jiang Z. Gill R.M. Muncaster M. Sopta M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 61: 115-141Google Scholar). Furthermore, ectopic expression of Rb-1 or microinjection of RB protein can block cell cycle progression at G1/S(6.Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y.W. Lee E.Y. Lee W.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 293-302Google Scholar, 7.Qin X-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar, 8.Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Google Scholar). RB forms complexes with many proteins, and this protein binding activity is required for growth suppression. RB binds to its target proteins by several different mechanisms(1.Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Google Scholar). Viral oncoproteins such as the SV40 large T-antigen (T-Ag), ( 1The abbreviations used are: T-AgSV40 large T-antigenGSTglutathione S-transferaseBES2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-amino]ethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFLfull-lengthRSVRous sarcoma virusCMVcytomegalovirusCycAcyclin AWTwild typeMEfragment of RB encoding amino acids 835-928.) and several cellular proteins, e.g. D-type cyclins and Elf-1, contain the LXCXE motif that is important for binding to the A/B pocket of RB(9.Kato J-Y. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Google Scholar, 10.Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M.

The E2F transcription factors do not contain the LXCXE motif and their binding requires the A/B pocket and C-terminal amino acids, and this E2F binding site is called the #x0201C;large A/B pocket”(7.Qin X-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W.G. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Google Scholar, 12.Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J.

Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of RB also contains an A/B pocket-independent binding domain, the C pocket, which binds to the nuclear c-Abl tyrosine kinase (15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). The large A/B pocket and the C pocket of RB do not overlap, because RB can simultaneously bind to E2F and c-Abl in vitro and in vivo(16.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar). In addition, complexes containing T-Ag/RB/c-Abl and cyclin D2/RB/c-Abl have been detected(15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar, 16.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar). The protein assembly function of RB is known to be required for growth suppression, since overexpression of the individual domains can inactivate RB biological function(16.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar).

The protein binding function of RB is regulated by phosphorylation(1.Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Google Scholar). RB phosphorylation is observed as cells progress from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, and this is correlated with the disruption of RB-assembled protein complexes. RB contains 16 Ser/Thr-Pro motifs which are potential Cdk phosphorylation sites. At least seven of these sites (Ser-249, −807, −811, and Thr-252, −373, −821, and −826) have been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo(17.Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Google Scholar, 18.Lin B.T-Y. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W-H. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Google Scholar, 19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). A number of other sites are also phosphorylated in vivo, but the exact identity of these sites is unknown(17.Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Google Scholar, 18.Lin B.T-Y. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W-H. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Google Scholar, 19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). In mitotic cells, cdc2/cyclin B is the principle RB kinase(19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). In interphase cells, RB is phosphorylated by other Cdk-cyclin complexes, including Cdk4/cyclin D and Cdk2/cyclin A(2.Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Google Scholar). Several Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites have been mutated in human and murine RB(9.Kato J-Y. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Google Scholar, 20.Hamel P.A. Cohen B.L. Sorce L.M. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6586-6595Google Scholar, 21.Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701Google Scholar, 22.Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3431-3438Google Scholar). Elimination of eight Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites in murine RB abolishes phosphorylation in vivo, and correlates with a more effective suppression of E2F or Elf-1 activity in transfected cells(11.Wang C-Y. Petryniak B. Thompson C.B. Kaelin W.G. Leiden J.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1330-1335Google Scholar, 22.Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3431-3438Google Scholar). The previous analysis of phosphorylation site mutants of RB did not address the question of whether the multiple Cdk phosphorylation sites of RB had redundant regulatory function. Since RB can bind its target proteins through at least three different mechanisms, we hypothesized that each protein binding function might be regulated by distinct phosphorylation sites(1.Wang J.Y.J. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Google Scholar). This hypothesis would suggest that the multiple phosphorylation sites can establish a collection of functional states of RB, depending on the specific sites phosphorylated. To address this hypothesis, we developed in vitro binding assays to examine the requirement of specific phosphorylation sites on RB protein binding activity. We show here that different phosphorylation sites are required to inhibit the binding to T-Ag, c-Abl, and E2F. Furthermore, specific sites are also required for the efficient phosphorylation of RB in vivo and the reversal of RB-mediated growth suppression by cyclin A. C33-A, HeLa, SAOS-2, and COS cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. C33-A and SAOS-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 and 15% fetal calf serum, respectively, at 37° C. COS and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37° C. Sf9 cells were cultured at 25° C in Grace's medium containing 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, yeastolate, lactalbumin hydrolysate, and gentamicin. The RB phosphorylation site mutants PSM.2S and PSM.4 were constructed by oligonucleatide-directed mutagenesis using the Mutagene in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). PSM.2S was constructed with the primer CTATATTGCACCCCTGAAGCTTCC. PSM.4 was constructed by further mutagenizing PSM.2S using the primer GGTCTGCCGGCACCAACAAAAATGGCTCCAAG. PSM.2T was constructed by polymerase chain reaction subcloning the T821A/T826A mutation from PSM.4 into WT-RB. The WT GST-RB constructs Ase-End, Ssp-End, and Mun-End have been previously described(15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). The PSM.2S, PSM.2T, and PSM.4 GST-RB fusions were constructed by replacing restriction fragments in WT-RB GST fusion constructs with those from each of the PSM clones. The pCMV-FL: WT, PSM.2S, PSM.2T, and PSM.4 expression plasmids, containing the full-length RB cDNA were constructed by cloning into the unique BamHI site of pCMV-Neo(23.Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Google Scholar). The CMV-CycA(8.Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Google Scholar), pBABE-Puro (24.Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Google Scholar), RSV-T-Ag(25.Deyerle K.L. Sajjadi F.G. Subramani S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 356-365Google Scholar), and GST-E2F-1 (13.Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Google Scholar) plasmids have been previously described. Recombinant SV40 large T-Ag baculovirus was described in Melendy and Stillman(26.Melendy T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 1942-1949Google Scholar). The BES-calcium phosphate method was used to transfect all cells(27.Chen C.A. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline 14-20 h after the addition of DNA. In transient assays, cells were harvested approximately 48 h after washing. All transfections were carried out using 16 μg of total DNA/100-mm dish. For the expression of FL-RB in C33-A cells, 10 μg of RC-CMV-CycA and 6 μg of the CMV-RB constructs were transfected. For co-immunoprecipitation of RB with T-Ag we used 8 μg of CMV-CycA, 4 μg of RSV-T-Ag, and 4 μg of CMV-RB. For COS transfections 16 μg of CMV-RB alone were transfected. For SAOS-2 transfections, 9 μg of effector (either RC-CMV-CycA or RSV-T-Ag), 6 μg of CMV-RB, and 1 μg of pBABE-Puro was used. For the flat cell formation assays, transfected SAOS-2 cells were split into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and puromycin at 0.5 mg/ml approximately 24 h after washing. Selection was carried out for 7-9 days, plates were stained with crystal violet, and the number of flat cells on the plate was determined by counting random fields as described previously(8.Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Google Scholar). In vivo phosphate labeling of RB was carried out essentially as described previously(20.Hamel P.A. Cohen B.L. Sorce L.M. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6586-6595Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation of phosphate-labeled RB, transfected cells were harvested by scraping and lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml 1,10-phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Nalgene). Clarified lysates were then pre-cleared by incubation with 9 μg of rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Cappel) and 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 4° C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g, then subjected to specific immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation from unlabeled cells, transfected cells were harvested by scraping and lysed in NNT-N buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from the clarified lysates using the following antibodies: for RB, 1.5 μg of G3-245 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) and for T-Ag, 1.5 μg of pAB 114 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). Immunoprecipitations were carried out for 4 h at 4° C using 4.5 μg of rabbit anti-mouse and protein A-Sepharose in a volume of 0.5-1.0 ml. Immunocomplexes were recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and washed 4-8 times with 1.0 ml of NNT-N or RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Immunoblotting was carried out with the following antibodies: full-length RB proteins were detected with the G3-245 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen), GST-RB proteins were detected with either 851 serum (15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar) or the XZ91 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen), and T-Ag was detected with the pAB 114 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). Immunoblots were developed using either alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for colorimetric development (Fisher), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel, Life Technologies, Inc.) for enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) development (Amersham). Active Cdk/cyclin kinases used to phosphorylate RB were obtained from two sources. Cdk2/cycA was purified from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (J. W. Harper). Alternatively, active cdc2 was immunopurified from nocodazole-arrested mitotic HeLa cells as described before(19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). Kinase reactions with either active cdc2 (immune complexes from 5 to 10 × 105 mitotic cells) or purified Cdk2/cycA (final concentration 1-5 nM) were carried out in 50 μl of kinase buffer using 150 μM ATP, 80-200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10-30 ng of RB as substrate. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 30-45 min with shaking at room temperature. The resulting phosphorylated protein was then either resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and detected by autoradiography and immunoblotting, used in the determination of stoichiometry of phosphorylation (see below), or utilized in in vitro binding assays (see below). For the determination of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation with in vitro phosphorylated proteins, the phosphorylated 32P-labeled proteins were first resolved by SDS-PAGE. The incorporated phosphate was then determined by liquid scintillation counting of the labeled bands, from which the phosphate molecules per protein molecule were determined. For the determination of the relative phosphorylation in vivo, immunoprecipitated metabolically labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography, followed by immunoblotting. The autoradiograms (32P) and immunoblots (protein) were quantitated with an LKB densitometer, and the 32P/protein ratio was normalized to WT, which was arbitrarily set to 100. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-agarose as described previously (15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). The binding of RB to c-Abl was also carried out as described previously(15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). For binding of soluble GST-AE to immobilized T-Ag, 1.0 μg of T-Ag was immobilized by immunoprecipitation with pAB 114. Approximately 200 ng of soluble GST-AE protein, obtained by elution with glutathione in 0.5 ml of NNT-N, was added to immobilized T-Ag and incubated for 35-45 min at 4° C, then washed 4 times with NNT-N. Bound protein was solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The GST-RB proteins were then detected by autoradiography and immunoblot. For the binding of soluble T-Ag to GST-AE, approximately 30 ng of each of the GST-AE fusions (WT, PSM.2S, PSM.2T, and PSM.4) were immobilized on glutathione-agarose. Sf9 cells infected with recombinant T-Ag baculovirus were lysed in NNT-N supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors, and clarified by centrifugation. Approximately 500 ng of T-Ag in 0.5 ml of NNT-N were added to the immobilized GST-AE and incubated at 4° C for 45 min. The GST-AE beads were then washed five times with NNT-N. The bound protein was solubilized by boiling in SDS buffer and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and T-Ag was visualized by immunoblot. The E2F supershift assay was carried out using 30 ng of soluble of GST-AE and E2F purified from HeLa cells as described previously(16.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar). RB produced in transfected C33-A cells was utilized in binding to immobilized, GST-c-Abl, GST-E2F-1, T-Ag, GST-E7, and GST-Elf1. The binding of RB to GST-Abl was carried out as described previously(15.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). For binding to T-Ag, GST-E7, or GST-Elf1, cells were lysed with NNT-N (including protease and phosphatase inhibitors), whereas for binding to GST-E2F-1, cells were lysed with NNT-0.1% N (NNT-N with 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and then incubated with immobilized T-Ag (200-300 ng), GST-Elf1 (1-1.5 μg), or GST-E2F-1 (500-700 ng) for 1 h at 4° C. The bound protein was recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g and washed 3-4 times with the lysis buffer. We focused our analysis on four Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites in RB, Ser-807, Ser-811, Thr-821, and Thr-826. These four sites were chosen because they are phosphorylated to a higher level than other sites in HeLa and Molt4 cells, suggesting that they are phosphorylation sites of physiological relevance(19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). These four sites can also be phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2/cyclin B or Cdk2/cyclin A(19.Lin B.T-Y. Wang J.Y.J. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 170: 227-241Google Scholar). We constructed double mutants of Ser-807/811 or Thr-821/826, because we were intrigued by the close proximity of the two Ser and the two Thr consensus sites. Both Ser-807 and −811 were mutated in Phosphorylation Site Mutant 2S (PSM.2S, Fig. 1). In PSM.2T, Thr-821 and −826 were mutated (Fig. 1). The PSM.4 combines the mutations in PSM.2S and PSM.2T. The WT and PSM proteins were expressed in bacteria as GST fusions in two forms: the GST-SE, which only contained the C pocket; or the GST-AE, which contained the A/B and C pockets of RB (Fig. 1). They were also expressed in mammalian cells as full-length RB proteins. The in vitro phosphorylation of WT RB with Cdk/cyclin could inhibit its protein binding activity as shown below. However, the mere incorporation of phosphate into RB did not necessarily cause an inhibition of binding, because some of the 32P-labeled WT RB was found to bind to its target proteins (data not shown). This result suggested that some of the phosphorylation sites might be irrelevant for the inhibition of protein binding. Therefore, we developed conditions to achieve the quantitative phosphorylation of RB in vitro at all Cdk consensus sites, using mitotic cdc2 kinase or purified Cdk2/cycA. Quantitative phosphorylation was indicated by the complete conversion of RB to a single band with slower electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was measured for WT and PSM RB, and found to be in agreement with the number of Cdk consensus phosphorylation sites present in each protein (Table 1A). GST is not phosphorylated by Cdk/cyclin(18.Lin B.T-Y. Gruenwald S. Morla A.O. Lee W-H. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 857-864Google Scholar). Along with the lower stoichiometry, the phosphorylated PSM proteins also exhibited a reduced shift in their electrophoretic mobility. The phosphorylated WT RB migrated to a higher position than its corresponding phosphorylation site mutants (Fig. 2, compare lanes 2-5 with lanes 6-8). Thus, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation appears to dictate the degree of mobility shift.Tabled 1 The quantitatively phosphorylated WT and PSM RB were used in two in vitro assays to examine the regulation of protein binding activity. In the first assay (Fig. 3), GST-RB proteins were labeled with 32P. Each labeled sample was combined with a known amount of its unphosphorylated counterpart to give a constant 32P/protein ratio, and then applied to immobilized c-Abl or T-Ag. The 32P/protein ratio of the input and the bound fraction was compared for each sample. If phosphorylation inhibited binding, the 32P/protein ratio of the bound fraction would be lower than that of the input. However, if phosphorylation did not affect binding, the 32P/protein ratio of the bound fraction would be equal to that of the input. In the second assay (Fig. 4), GST-RB proteins were quantitatively phosphorylated. The RB proteins were then used either in an immobilized form to bind soluble c-Abl or T-Ag (Fig. 4, B and C), or in a soluble form to interact with E2F in gel shift assays (Fig. 4D).Figure 4:Differential protein binding activities of in vitro phosphorylated RB. A, GST-AE fragments used in binding assays. GST-AE proteins WT (lanes 1 and 5), PSM.2S (lanes 2 and 6), PSM.2T (lanes 3 and 7), and PSM.4 (lanes 4 and 8), were immobilized on GSH-agarose and incubated with Cdk2/cycA in the absence (lanes 1-4) or presence (lanes 5-8) of 150 μM ATP. A portion of each sample was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, then immunoblotted with anti-RB antibody. B, phosphorylation of Ser-807/811 is required to inhibit c-Abl binding. Equal amounts of GST-AE proteins, either unphosphorylated (lanes 1-4) or phosphorylated (lanes 5-9) as shown in A, were incubated with in vitro translated c-Abl, labeled with [35S]methionine. The c-Abl bound to immobilized GST-AE, WT (lanes 1 and 5), PSM.2S (lanes 2 and 6), PSM.2T (lanes 3 and 7), or PSM.4 (lanes 4 and 8), was recovered and resolved by 6.5% SDS-PAGE. The amount of c-Abl bound was determined by autofluorography. C, phosphorylation of Thr-821/826 is required to inhibit T-Ag. binding. The immobilized GST-AE proteins, either unphosphorylated (lanes 1-4) or phosphorylated (lanes 5-8) as shown in A, were incubated with lysate of Sf9 cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus expressing T-Ag. The T-Ag bound to GST-AE, WT (lanes 1 and 5), PSM.2S (lanes 2 and 6), PSM.2T (lanes 3 and 7), or PSM.4 (lanes 4 and 8), was resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P. The amount of bound T-Ag was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies for T-Ag. D, phosphorylation at Ser-807/811 and Thr-821/826 is dispensible for inhibiting binding to E2F. The unphosphorylated GST-AE proteins (lanes 1-4 and 9), the phosphorylated GST-AE proteins (lanes 5-8), or the GST-SE protein (lane 10) were purified and added to DNA binding reactions, as described under #x0201C;Materials and Methods.” To prevent the phosphorylation of E2F by Cdk2/cyclin A, excess EDTA was added to the GST-AE preparations after phosphorylation but prior to incubation with E2F. The GST-SE protein, lacking the A/B pocket, does not cause any shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the E2F•DNA complex (lane 10). Unphosphorylated GST-AE, WT (lanes 1 and 9), PSM.2S (lane 2), PSM.2T (lane 3), and PSM.4 (lane 4), all formed complexes with E2F, shifting the mobility of the E2F•DNA complex to a position labeled E2F/RB. Phosphorylated GST-AE, WT (lane 5), PSM.2S (lane 6), PSM.2T (lane 7), and PSM.4 (lane 8), all failed to complex with E2F, having no effect on the mobility of the E2F•DNA complex. The addition of Cdk2/cycA under these experimental conditions had no observable effect on the E2F•DNA complex (compare lanes 1 and 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Quantitative phosphorylation of the WT SE fragment of RB could be shown to inhibit c-Abl binding in vitro (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This inhibition was indicated by a 15-20-fold reduction in the 32P/protein ratio of the bound fraction (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 of the two panels). Unlike WT SE, the phosphorylated PSM.2S could bind to c-Abl, and the 32P/protein ratios of the input and bound fractions were similar (compare lane 2 of the two panels). PSM.4 behaved in a fashion identical to PSM.2S (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The ME fragment of RB did not bind to c-Abl, demonstrating specificity in the binding reaction (lane 4). This result suggested that phosphorylation at Ser-807/811 was necessary for the inhibition of RB/c-Abl interaction. The same result was obtained with the second in vitro assay (Fig. 4B). Equal amounts of unphosphorylated (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4) and phosphorylated WT and PSM GST-AE (Fig. 4A, lanes 5-8) were used in the binding reactions. The unphosphorylated WT or PSM proteins bound the same amount of c-Abl, which was translated in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-4). Phosphorylation of WT RB reduced c-Abl binding to background level (compare lanes 1 and 5). Phosphorylation of PSM.2S and PSM.4, again, had no effect on RB/c-Abl complex formation (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 2 and 4 with 6 and 8). Phosphorylation of PSM.2T did cause an inhibition of c-Abl binding (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 7). Taken together, these results show that phosphorylation of Ser-807/811 is required to inhibit the C pocket function of RB, while the phosphorylation of Thr-821/826 is not required. In the absence of Ser-807/811, phosphorylation of the remaining eight Cdk consensus sites in the AE fragment of RB cannot disrupt the RB/c-Abl interaction. The inhibition of T-Ag binding by phosphorylation could also be demonstrated in vitro, as shown by a 10-15-fold reduction in the 32P/protein ratio of the WT GST-AE fraction bound to immobilized T-Ag (Fig. 3B, lane 1). The RB mutant C706F failed to bind to T-Ag under the experimental conditions (lane 4), showing specificity for the binding reactions. The phosphorylated PSM.2S showed a reduced affinity for T-Ag, comparable to that of the WT (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, phosphorylated PSM.4 was capable of binding to T-Ag, as indicated by the similar 32P/protein ratio in the input and the bound fractions (Fig. 3B, lane 3). The same result was again obtained with the second in vitro assay. The unphosphorylated WT or PSM proteins bound equal amounts of T-Ag (Fig. 4C, lanes 1-4). Phosphorylation of WT and PSM.2S led to an inhibition of T-Ag binding (Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 6). However, the phosphorylated PSM.2T protein retained full activity to complex with T-Ag (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 3 and 7). As expected, PSM.4 behaved like PSM.2T (Fig. 4C, compare lane 4 with 8). These results showed that phosphorylation at Thr-821/826, but not at Ser-807/811, is necessary for the inhibition of T-Ag binding. To assay the E2F binding activity, the unphosphorylated or phosphorylated GST-AE fragments were added to purified E2F and an E2F-oligonucleotide (Fig. 4D). In the unphosphorylated form, the WT and the PSM fragments tested all bound to E2F, as indicated by the #x0201C;supershift” of the E2F•DNA complex (lanes 1-4). All four proteins failed to complex with E2F•DNA when phosphorylated (lanes 5-8). As a negative control, the GST-SE fragment of RB did not supershift the E2F•DNA complex (lane 10). These results showed that Cdk sites within the AE fragment of RB were sufficient to inhibit E2F binding. However, phosphorylation of Ser-807/811 and Thr-821/826 are not required to inhibit E2F binding. With the in vitro quantitatively phosphorylated RB, we showed that different Cdk sites were required to regulate binding to c-Abl, T-Ag, and E2F. Because not all of the Cdk sites were quantitatively phosphorylated in vivo, we wished to determine the protein binding activity of in vivo phosphorylated WT and PSM RB. The WT and PSM proteins were transiently expressed in the human cervical carcinoma cell line, C33-A, which contains a truncated RB that is unstable. Phosphorylation of the exogeneously expressed RB was enhanced by the cotransfection with cyclin A. The relative extent of phosphorylation was determined by the appearance of slower migrating bands on anti-RB immunoblots and by 32P labeling (Fig. 5). The WT and PSM.2T were phosphorylated in vivo, as indicated by the slower migrating bands which were 32P-labeled (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 3, upper and lower panels). The PSM.2S and PSM.4 proteins were labeled with 32P in vivo (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4, upper panel), but did not generate the characteristic mobility shift (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 4, lower panel). The relative level of in vivo phosphorylation was determined for each protein (Table 1B). PSM.2T was phosphorylated to 80-90% that of WT, consistent with the mutation of two out of 16 phosphorylation sites (Table 1B). The relative phosphorylation for PSM.2S or PSM.4 was only about 40% that of WT (Table 1B). The inefficient phosphorylation of the Ser-807/811 mutant RB was consistent with a previous report which showed that mutation of the murine equivalent of Ser-807/811 prevented the hyperphosphorylation of murine RB in vivo(21.Hamel P.A. Gill R.M. Phillips R.A. Gallie B.L. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 693-701Google Scholar). Because WT and PSM.2T were both hyperphosphorylated in vivo (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2), we compared their binding to c-Abl, E2F, and T-Ag (Fig. 6, B-D). Since PSM.2S was not hyperphosphorylated in vivo, it was not used in the subsequent assays. The hyperphosphorylated WT and PSM.2T could not bind to c-Abl (Fig. 6B), nor did they bind to E2F-1 (Fig. 6C). In contrast, the hyperphosphorylated bands of PSM.2T could bind to T-Ag (Fig. 6D). These results were consistent with those obtained with in vitro phosphorylated RB, showing that phosphorylation at Thr-821/826 is only required for the inhibition of T-Ag binding. Since T-Ag interacts with RB through an LXCXE motif, we tested whether phosphorylation of Thr-821/826 was required to regulate the binding of other LXCXE containing proteins, e.g. E7 and Elf-1. As with T-Ag, the phosphorylated WT RB did not bind to E7 or Elf-1 (Fig. 6, E and F, lane 1), while the phosphorylated upper bands of PSM.2T did bind to these two proteins (Fig. 6, E and F, lane 2). Thus, phosphorylation cannot inhibit the LXCXE binding function of RB when Thr-821/826 are mutated. To determine whether the GST pull-down assays reflected the regulation of T-Ag binding inside the cell, we performed coimmunoprecipitation. In C33-A cells cotransfected with T-Ag and RB, only the underphosphorylated form of WT was coprecipitated with T-Ag (Fig. 7A, lane 1). In contrast, the hyperphosphorylated PSM.2T bands were brought down by anti-T-Ag immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7A, lane 2). Similar results were also obtained when WT and PSM.2T proteins were expressed in COS cells and phosphorylated by the endogenous Cdk/cyclins (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, PSM.2T binds to T-Ag irrespective of its phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of RB has been correlated with the inactivation of its growth suppression function in SAOS-2 cells(8.Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Google Scholar). Exogenous RB does not become phosphorylated in SAOS-2 cells and causes a cell cycle block at G1/S which generates growth-arrested flat cells. Cotransfection of cyclin A can drive RB phosphorylation in SAOS-2 cells and alleviate the cell cycle block(8.Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Google Scholar). In keeping with previous reports, WT RB gave rise to numerous flat cells, and the number of flat cells was reduced 8-fold with the cotransfection of cyclin A (Table 2). PSM.2T induced a similar number of flat cells and the number was reduced 6-fold by the cotransfection of cyclin A. With PSM.2S, however, cyclin A only caused a 1.6-fold reduction in the number of flat cells (Table 2). To determine if PSM.2S could be inactivated by other means, we cotransfected it with T-Ag (Table 2). The wild type RB and PSM.2S were both sensitive to T-Ag, which caused a 33-fold reduction in the number of flat cells. Cotransfection with cyclin A drove the phosphorylation of WT and PSM RB, and the relative level of phosphorylation was similar to that observed with C33-A cells (Fig. 5 and Table 1B). PSM.2S was poorly phosphorylated in SAOS-2 cells, and this might account for its resistance to the inactivation by cyclin A.Tabled 1 Under conditions where every Cdk consensus site is phosphorylated, we have shown that in vitro phosphorylation does inhibit the protein binding function of RB. Using mutants lacking specific Cdk phosphorylation sites, we also demonstrated that different Cdk sites are required for inhibiting distinct RB protein binding activities. Specifically, Ser-807/811 is required for the inhibition of c-Abl binding, while phosphorylation of Thr-821/826 is required for the inhibition of binding to T-Ag, Elf-1, and E7 (all of which contain the LXCXE motif). However, none of these sites are required for the inhibition of E2F binding. We find that the mutation of Ser-807/811 prevents the efficient phosphorylation of RB in vivo, and cyclin A cannot overcome the growth suppressing activity of this mutant in SAOS-2 cells. In contrast, mutation of Thr-821/826 does not prevent RB hyperphosphorylation nor the inactivation of its growth suppressing activity by cyclin A. Both T-Ag and E2F interact with RB through the A/B pocket. However, the LXCXE motif that mediates the T-Ag binding is not found in E2F(12.Kaelin W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Google Scholar, 13.Helin K. Lees J.A. Vidal M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Cell. 1992; 70: 337-350Google Scholar). Furthermore, the CRII fragment of E1A, which contains the LXCXE motif, cannot disrupt the RB/E2F complex(28.Ikeda M-A. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 7029-7035Google Scholar). Thus, the A/B pocket of RB may contain two binding sites, one for the LXCXE motif and another for E2F. This idea is consistent with our finding that the regulation of T-Ag and E2F binding to RB requires different Cdk phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of Thr-821/826 is required for the disruption of the T-Ag•RB complex. In addition to T-Ag, we have found that the inhibition of binding to Elf-1 and E7, both of which contain the LXCXE motif, also required Thr-821/826. This finding strongly supports that the LXCXE binding site is regulated by Thr-821/826 phosphorylation. We cannot determine if both threonine residues or only one of them is required for the regulation of LXCXE binding. Single site mutants would have to be constructed to resolve this issue. Since mutation of Thr-821/826 does not interfere with the regulation of E2F binding, other phosphorylation sites must be sufficient to disrupt the A/B pocket function that mediates E2F interaction. It is interesting to find that the phosphorylation sites required for the inhibition of LXCXE binding are outside of the minimal A/B pocket domain. We could envision at least two possible mechanisms for these phosphothreonines to inhibit the A/B pocket activity. The phosphorylated threonine may directly bind to the A/B pocket and sterically hinder the binding of LXCXE containing proteins. Alternatively, phosphorylation at Thr-821/826 may result in a conformational change that can lead to the disruption of the LXCXE binding structure in the A/B pocket. The growth suppression function of RB depends on its ability to assemble protein complexes(16.Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar). This concept is supported by three lines of evidence: (a) both the large A/B and the C pockets of RB are required for growth suppression, (b) the A/B and C domains of RB do not function in-trans, and (c) the A/B or C domain fragments can act as dominant interfering mutants to disrupt RB function. According to this model, any phosphorylation event that inhibits one of the three protein binding functions should be sufficient to inactivate the growth suppression function of RB. This could explain the observation that PSM.2T-RB, despite the lack of two major phosphorylation sites, can still be inactivated by cyclin A. The phosphorylated PSM.2T, as shown here, retains the ability to bind the LXCXE motif, but cannot suppress SAOS-2 growth. Presumably this is because the c-Abl and the E2F binding activities are still inactivated by phosphorylation in this mutant, and therefore the phosphorylated PSM.2T-RB cannot assemble protein complexes. Alternatively, the LXCXE binding function may not be relevant for the suppression of SAOS-2 cells. The present data does not rule out the possibility that PSM.2T-RB may act as a dominant growth suppressor in other cell types. If partial phosphorylation of RB can disrupt its growth suppression function, why then design multiple phosphorylation sites in RB? One possibility is that the Cdk-mediated phosphorylation is directed at regulating what types of complexes RB can assemble. The protein complexes formed on partially phosphorylated RB may be important in fine-tuning regulatory events during cell cycle progression. There is evidence that RB phosphorylation occurs in a stepwise manner during G1 progression. Two-dimensional phosphotryptic mapping of RB in synchronized cells has revealed sequential loading of specific phosphorylation sites as cells progress from quiescence to S-phase (29.DeCaprio J.A. Furukawa Y. Ajchenbaum F. Griffin J.D. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1795-1798Google Scholar). A conceivable consequence of stepwise phosphorylation may be as follows: if phosphorylation occurs at sites that inhibit E2F binding but not at Thr-821/826, this event would release E2F and make more RB available for binding to the cellular LXCXE containing proteins. This might be a way for Cdk to orient the A/B pocket of RB toward specific cellular targets. Partial phosphorylation of RB might also lead to other modulations of RB binding proteins. For example, phosphorylation of Ser-807/811, but not at other sites, would activate the c-Abl tyrosine kinase which could then phosphorylate proteins still bound to the A/B pocket. This is a possible mechanism for Cdk to activate the tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific nuclear protein. The selective, stepwise phosphorylation of RB may provide a continuous modulation of RB-assembled complexes to alter their activities throughout the cell cycle. We thank B. T-Y. Lin and D.

https://openalex.org/W2048646985,"Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple agents that promote survival of PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons deprived of trophic support also block cell cycle progression. Presently, we address whether inhibition of cell cycle-related cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) prevents neuronal cell death. We show that two distinct CDK inhibitors, flavopiridol and olomoucine, suppress the death of neuronal PC12 cells and sympathetic neurons. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibitor concentrations required to promote survival correlate with their ability to inhibit proliferation. Promotion of survival, however, does not correlate with inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c-Jun kinase activities or with interference with the activation of c-Jun kinase that accompanies serum/nerve growth factor deprivation. In contrast to their actions on nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells, the CDK inhibitors do not prevent the death of proliferation-competent PC12 cells and, in fact, promote their cell death. These findings support the hypothesis that post-mitotic neuronal cells die after removal of trophic support due to an attempt to re-enter the cell cycle in an uncoordinated and inappropriate manner. We speculate that cycling PC12 cells are not saved by these agents due to a signaling conflict between an inherent oncogenic signal and the inhibition of CDK activity.

Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Google Scholar). Thus, DGK is thought to be one of the key enzymes involved in the cellular signal transduction(1.Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 47-50Google Scholar, 7.Kanoh H. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Cell. Signal. 1993; 5: 495-503Google Scholar). For instance, DGK was found to be involved in interleukin-2 production in T-lymphocytes (8.Aussel C. Pelassy C. Breittmayer J.P. Cell Immunol. 1992; 139: 333-341Google Scholar) and retinal degeneration of Drosophila melanogaster(9.Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many DGK isozymes have been purified from various animal sources, such as two isozymes from porcine brain and thymus(10.Kanoh H. Kondoh H. Ono T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1767-1774Google Scholar, 11.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 409-413Google Scholar), three from human platelets(12.Yada Y. Ozeki T. Kanoh H. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19237-19243Google Scholar), two from rat brain(13.Kato M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 794-800Google Scholar), and one from bovine testis(14.Walsh J.P. Suen R. Lemaitre R.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21155-21164Google Scholar). These isozymes have been described to differ from each other with respect to molecular masses, enzymological properties, activators, and substrate specificity. It is thus likely that these isozymes are operated under distinct regulatory mechanisms. To date, three mammalian DGK genes, DGKs α(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar, 16.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), and γ (19.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar, 20.Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Google Scholar) have been isolated. The protein products of these genes contain four conserved regions, i.e. the N-terminal region (C1), two sets of Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs (C2), two cysteine-rich zinc finger-like structures (C3), and the C-terminal C4 regions. These isozymes have been shown to exhibit different tissue- and cell-specific modes of expression. Namely, DGKα is most abundant in thymus (15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar) and oligodendrocytes of brain(17.Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Google Scholar), and DGKβ is particularly enriched in rat neuron(18.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar). DGKγ, on the other hand, is highly expressed in the human retina (19.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar) and rat cerebellar Purkinje cells(20.Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Google Scholar). Despite different expression patterns, the structural and enzymatic properties of the three cloned DGKs are very similar to each other, and all of them are characteristically expressed in the central nervous system. Thus, it seems quite likely that DGK gene family may possibly include additional hitherto unknown members with distinct structural features. Identification of novel DGK isozymes and determination of the complete DGK repertoire represent an important and necessary step for elucidating the exact physiological role of DGK. In the present investigation, we cloned a novel DGK isozyme, DGKδ, that apparently belongs to a subfamily distinct from that consisting of DGKs previously cloned. Interestingly, the novel isozyme contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N terminus and a C-terminal tail similar to those of EPH family of protein-tyrosine kinases. Moreover, its expression pattern was markedly different from those of other DGKs. Restriction enzymes, DNA modifying enzymes, and linkers were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Toyobo Co. and New England BioLabs. [α-32P]dCTP (~3000 Ci/mmol) was bought from Amersham Corp. [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN Biomedicals. 1-Stearoyl-2-arachidonoylglycerol and 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoylglycerol were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. 1,2-Dioleoylglycerol, 1,2-didecanoylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine (PS) were from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. General manipulation of DNA and RNA was carried out according to the standard procedures(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNAs were extracted by the guanidium/cesium chloride method (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) from Jurkat and HepG2 cells. RNAs obtained were enriched in poly(A)+ RNA content by oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography (Pharmacia Biotech Inc. mRNA purification kit). Poly(A)+ RNAs from human retina, testis, and HL-60 cells were purchased from Clontech. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers (P1, 5′-GCCTCGAGTA(T/C)TT(T/C)AG(T/C)(G/A/T)T(G/A/T/C)GG(G/A/T/C)GT(G/A/T/C)GA-3′ and P2, 5′-CGCTCGAGTC(G/A/T/C)(C/A)C(A/G)TC(G/A/T/C)A(C/T)(C/T)TG(G/A/T/C)A(T/C)(G/A/T/C)GG-3′) were derived from the consensus amino acid sequences Tyr-Phe-Ser-(Phe/Ile/Val)-Gly-Val-Asp and Pro-Met-Gln-(Val/Ile)-Asp-(Gly/Val)-Glu found in the members of the DGK family, i.e. porcine DGKα(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar), human DGKα(16.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 151-158Google Scholar), rat DGKα(17.Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Google Scholar), rat DGKβ(18.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), Drosophila DGK1(23.Masai I. Hosoya T. Kojima S. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6030-6034Google Scholar), and Drosophila DGK2(9.Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Google Scholar). At this stage of in vestigation, the primary structure of human DGKγ (19.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar) had not been revealed. These sequences correspond to positions 523-529 and 693-699, respectively, of the amino acid sequence of porcine DGKα(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar). Sufficient degeneracy was incorporated into the primer sequences to encompass divergence among the various isozymes at the nucleotide level. To facilitate subcloning, XhoI endonuclease sites (underlined) were added to the 5′-ends of both primers. To obtain DGK-related core sequences, reverse transcriptase PCR amplification was carried out using GeneAmp(™) RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). In brief, first strand cDNA template was synthesized from 0.1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from human testis in 20 μl of reverse transcriptase buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM each dNTP, 1 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 2.5 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and 2.5 μM random hexamers. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25°C and then for 30 min at 42°C. After heat treatment (97°C for 5 min), the mixture was added with 80 μl of Taq polymerase buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1 nmol each of primers P1 and P2. Amplification reactions were carried out for 40 cycles on a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) under the following conditions: 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation step at 72°C for 7 min. Amplified PCR products were subsequently separated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. Bands in the position (~500 bp) predicted by reference to the cDNA sequences of DGKs so far cloned were recovered, digested with XhoI, and subcloned into the XhoI site of pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). Randomly primed and oligo(dT)-primed cDNA libraries were constructed in phage λgt10 (Pharmacia TimeSaver(™) cDNA synthesis kit and Stratagene Gigapack® II Gold packaging extract) using poly(A)+ RNA prepared from human testis and HepG2 cells. Approximately 8 × 105 (testis) and 1 × 106 (HepG2 cells) bacteriophage plaques were screened under the stringent condition of hybridization(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Mannual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The PCR amplification product (DGKD core) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide primer extension (24.Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) and used as a probe (Fig. 1). Two representative overlapping clones were designated DGKD3 and DGKD10 (Fig. 1) RACE, an anchored PCR procedure, was performed to extend the 5′-end of the novel DGK-related cDNA (DGKD10) using 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (Clontech). Briefly, cDNA was first synthesized with antisense gene-specific primer, R1 (5′-ATTTCGGAGAGGACCCAGCCAACAC-3′), from HepG2 poly(A)+ RNA (see Fig. 1). A single-stranded anchor oligonucleotide included in the kit was ligated to the 3′-end of the cDNA by T4 RNA ligase. Following anchor ligation, the cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification using a primer (containing an EcoRI site) complementary to the anchor and a second nested gene-specific primer, R2 (5′-GCGAATTCATCCCCGCCACAAACCAGAATCCG-3′, EcoRI site underlined). The PCR was conducted for 45 cycles (94°C for 1 min, 60°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min) as above. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and separated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The largest fragment (~1100 bp) was recovered and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II. The three longest cDNA clones (DKD11-13) were selected for sequence analysis. Purified plasmid DNAs from positive clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (25.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Sequences were analyzed using the GeneWorks sequence analysis software (IntelliGenetics Inc.). Deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed and aligned with related sequences included in the DNA Data Bank of Japan using the program FASTA(26.Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs (2 μg each) of HepG2 cells, Jurkat cells, HL-60 cells, and retina were separated on 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher and Schuell) as described previously(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar). The other poly(A)+ RNAs (2 μg each) were analyzed using multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blot I and II (Clontech). The hybridization probe used was the 402-bp XhoI-NcoI fragment (nucleotide 2,606-3,007) of DGKD3 (see Fig. 1). The nylon membranes were hybridized and washed as described previously(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar). Autoradiography was performed at −80°C for 60 h with intensifying screens. To construct the cDNA containing the full length of an open reading frame, DGKD3 and DGKD10 were joined at the KpnI site, and the resultant construct and DGKD11 were combined at the BspEI site. (see Fig. 1). In order to maximally fulfill Kozak consensus translation initiation sequence (27.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Google Scholar) and also to create EcoRI sites in both 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, several mutations were introduced into the composite cDNA (DGKD103) by in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.) employing complementary oligonucleotides with nucleotide substitutions as indicated in Fig. 1. The nucleotide substitutions were confirmed by sequencing. The full coding region (DGKD104) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the simian virus 40-based expression vector pSRE(28.Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1015-1021Google Scholar), which was derived from the original pcDL-SRα-296 vector (29.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg each of the resultant construct, pSRE-DGKδ, and pSRE vector alone were transfected into COS-7 cells (100-mm dish) using DEAE-dextran (30.Okayama H. Kawauchi M. Brownstein M. Lee F. Yokota T. Arai K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 3-28Google Scholar) as described previously(28.Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1015-1021Google Scholar). After 3 days, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in the lysis buffer (0.5 ml/100 mm dish) containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After a low speed centrifugation (550 × g for 10 min), the soluble and particulate fractions were separated by a centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The particulate fraction was suspended in the same volume of the lysis buffer. The aliquots of the two fractions were subjected to DGK activity assay and immunoblot analysis. The octyl glucoside mixed micellar assay of DGK activity was done as described previously(31.Sakane F. Yamada K. Imai S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7096-7100Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mM octyl glucoside, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaF, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM diacylglycerol, and 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (100,000 cpm/nmol). The reaction was initiated by adding the particulate or soluble fraction (10 μg of protein) from COS-7 cells and continued for 5 min at 30°C. Lipids were extracted from the mixture, and phosphatidic acid separated by thin layer chromatography (32.MacDonald M.L. Mack K.F. Richardson C.N. Glomset J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1575-1583Google Scholar) was scraped and counted by a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. The cDNA fragment (644 bp) encoding the C-terminal peptide (amino acids 1079-1169) of DGKδ was obtained by digestion of DGKD3 with DraI and SmaI (Fig. 1). The fragment was subcloned into the T7 RNA polymerase-dependent pET3c vector(33.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). This construct was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pLysS and induced in the presence of 1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside as described previously(33.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). The expressed fusion protein recovered in insoluble fraction was solubilized with 8 M urea and dialyzed against 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 30 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the resultant supernatant was used as an antigen. Rabbits were immunized by subcutaneous multiple injections of 150 μg of the fusion protein emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Wako Pure Chemicals). Injections were repeated at 2-week intervals, and the serum was obtained after the fifth injection. The IgG was purified by a column chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The soluble and particulate fractions of COS-7 cells (10 μg of protein each) were separated on an SDS, 7.5% polyacrylamide gel(34.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) and blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 20% (w/v) skim milk. The membrane was incubated with the anti-DGKδ antibody (0.7 μg/ml) in the same buffer for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated, anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Corp.). In order to identify novel genes potentially related to the DGK family, a PCR-based amplification strategy was performed. We designed two degenerate oligonucleotide primers, P1 and P2 (Fig. 1 and 2), that corresponded to the amino acid sequences, Tyr-Phe-Ser-(Phe/Ile/Val)-Gly-Val-Asp and Pro-Met-Gln-(Val/Ile)-Asp-(Gly/Val)-Glu (residues 523-529 and 693-699 in porcine DGKα, respectively; (15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar)). The amino acid sequences are highly conserved among all mammalian DGK isozymes and Drosophila homologs cloned so far(9.Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Google Scholar, 15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar, 16.Schaap D. de Widt J. van der Wal J. Vandekerckhove J. van Damme J. Gussow D. Ploegh H.L. van Blitterswijk W.J. van der Bend R.L. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 151-158Google Scholar, 17.Goto K. Watanabe M. Kondo H. Yuasa H. Sakane F. Kanoh H. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 16: 75-87Google Scholar, 18.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar, 23.Masai I. Hosoya T. Kojima S. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6030-6034Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase PCR amplification of poly(A)+ RNA derived from human testis resulted in several products having the expected size of ~500 bp (not shown). The amplification products were shortened by digestion with XhoI (see Fig. 1), which was used to produce cohesive-ends for subcloning, and the resultant ~350-bp fragments were subcloned into pBluescript. Sequence analysis identified one 363-bp clone encoding a peptide of 121 amino acids. The sequence of this peptide was 43 and 45% identical to the corresponding sequences in porcine DGKα and rat DGKβ, respectively. Therefore, the PCR product was judged to correspond to a novel DGK gene. Since the new DGK clone is the fourth to be reported to our knowledge, it is designated DGKδ. This cDNA clone (the DGKD core sequence, Fig. 1) was used to screen ~800,000 clones of the testis library and ~1,000,000 clones of the HepG2 cell library. Seven positive clones (DGKD1-7) and three positive clones (DGKD8-10) were isolated from the testis and the HepG2 libraries, respectively (Fig. 1). Only the most 5′- and 3′-stretched clones, DGKD10 and −3, respectively, were indicated in Fig. 1. However, sequence analysis revealed that these clones lacked the N-terminal part of the open reading frame including the initiation methionine codon. Although we further screened the same libraries with DGKD10 cDNA as a probe, we could not obtain clones covering the 5′-region. We, therefore, carried out the RACE-anchored PCR procedure using poly(A)+ RNA isolated from HepG2 cells as a template. The 5′-anchored PCR employing primers R1 and R2 (Figure 1:, Figure 2:) gave rise to three clones (DGKD11-13) with the same length, all of which were found to cover the complete 5′-region. The composite DGKδ cDNA sequence obtained from clones DGKD3, DGKD10, and DGKD11 (DGKD103, 6214 bp, Fig. 1) has an open reading frame starting from nucleotide 81 to nucleotide 3590 (Fig. 2). The initiation ATG of the open reading frame was identified as the first ATG sequence following an in-frame termination codon at nucleotide 66 to 68. The open reading frame is flanked by 80- (5′-) and 2624-bp (3′-) noncoding nucleotide sequences. A polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) is found 22 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) sequence at the 3′-end of the cDNA. The DGKδ cDNA encodes a putative protein of 1169 amino acid residues having a calculated Mr of 130,006 (Fig. 2). The primary structure displays several characteristic features shared by other DGK isozymes cloned so far (Fig. 3A). DGKδ contains a tandem repeat of cysteine-rich sequence (residues His120-Cys169 and His192-Cys242), namely, His-X10-12-Cys-X2-Cys-X12-14-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X2-Cys-X5-7-Cys, which is conserved in all of the different DGK isozymes (Fig. 3, A and B). This motif was also found in protein kinase C(35.Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Google Scholar), n-chimaerin(36.Hall C. Monfries C. Smith P. Lim H.H. Kozma R. Armed S. Vannaisingham V. Leung T. Lim L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 11-16Google Scholar), and a vav oncogene product(37.Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Google Scholar). The sequence identities of zinc fingers of DGKδ were 33, 33, and 32%, respectively, when compared with those of porcine DGKα(15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar), rat DGKβ(18.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), and human DGKγ(19.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar). Although the relative locations of critical residues like His and Cys are well conserved, the overall identity of amino acid sequences of the two zinc fingers is not particularly high among different DGKs (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Sequence comparison of DGKδ with other DGKs, the members of the EPH receptor family and several proteins containing the PH domain. A, the schematic structure of DGKδ is shown with reference to previously sequenced porcine DGKα (15.Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Google Scholar), rat DGKβ(18.Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7598-7602Google Scholar), human DGKγ(19.Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Google Scholar), Drosophila DGK1 (23.Masai I. Hosoya T. Kojima S. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6030-6034Google Scholar), and Drosophila DGK2(9.Masai I. Okazaki A. Hosoya T. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11157-11161Google Scholar). The mammalian DGK gene family is proposed to consist of at least two enzyme subfamilies tentatively designated Type I and Type II.

The present findings document the intrinsic ability of sphingoid bases to induce apoptosis in HL-60 and U937 cells. Exposure to either sphingosine or sphinganine (0.001-10 μM) for 6 h promoted apoptotic degradation of genomic DNA as indicated by (a) electrophoretic resolution of 50-kilobase pair DNA loop fragments and 0.2-1.2-kilobase pair DNA fragment ladders on agarose gels, and (b) spectrofluorophotometric determination of the formation and release of double-stranded fragments and corresponding loss of integrity of bulk DNA. DNA damage correlated directly with reduced cloning efficiency and was associated with the appearance of apoptotic cytoarchitectural traits. At sublethal concentrations (≤750 nM), however, sphingoid bases synergistically augmented the apoptotic capacity of ceramide (10 μM), producing both a leftward shift in the ceramide concentration-response profile and a pronounced increase in the response to maximally effective levels of ceramide. Thus, sphingosine and sphinganine increased both the potency and efficacy of ceramide. The apoptotic capacity of bacterial sphingomyelinase (50 milliunits/ml) was similarly enhanced by either (a) acute co-exposure to highly selective pharmacological inhibitors of protein kinase C such as calphostin C and chelerythrine or (b) chronic pre-exposure to the non-tumor-promoting protein kinase C activator bryostatin 1, which completely down-modulated total assayable protein kinase C activity. These findings demonstrate that inhibition of protein kinase C by physiological or pharmacological agents potentiates the lethal actions of ceramide in human leukemia cells, providing further support for the emerging concept of a cytoprotective function of the protein kinase C isoenzyme family in the regulation of leukemic cell survival.

https://openalex.org/W2112809104,"Based on the reports of the activation of the transcription factor known as STAT3 (for signal transducers and activators of transcription) or APRF (for acute phase response factor) by various cytokines, we investigated the possible role of STAT3 in type I interferon (IFN) receptor signaling. We show that STAT3 undergoes IFNαdependent tyrosine phosphorylation and IFNα treatment induces protein-DNA complexes that contain STAT3. In addition, STAT3 associates with the IFNAR-1 chain of the type I receptor in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner upon IFNα addition. The binding of STAT3 to the IFNAR-1 chain occurs through a direct interaction between the SH2 domain-containing portion of STAT3 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chain. Furthermore, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 bound to the IFNAR-1 chain also undergoes a secondary modification involving serine phosphorylation. This phosphorylation event is apparently mediated by protein kinase C, since it was blocked by low concentrations of the protein kinase inhibitor H-7. The biological relevance of IFN activation of STAT3 is further illustrated by the finding that STAT3 is not activated by IFN in a cell line resistant to the antiviral and antiproliferative actions of IFNα but in which other components of the JAK-STAT pathway are activated by IFNα.

Cytokines are multifunctional mediators of the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, and neural systems. They exert their effects through specific surface receptors expressed on target cells, triggering biological effects through the activation of specific gene transcription. One approach to the understanding of the molecular basis of transcriptional activation by cytokines is the identification of cis-responsive elements within genes and the transcription factors responsive to cytokine signals. For example, the type I interferons (IFNs), ( 1The abbreviations used are: IFNinterferonISGIFN-stimulated geneISREIFN stimulus response elementmAbmonoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideGSTglutathione S-transferaseSIEsis-inducible elementEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaySIFsis-inducible factorISGFIFN-stimulated gene factorPKCprotein kinase CTBMtyrosine-based activation motif.) IFNα and IFNβ, induce the transcription of the early IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) gene family(1.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). IFNs are cytokines that have profound effects on cells, including antiviral protection, inhibition of the proliferation of normal and transformed cells, and modulation of the immune system. IFN signaling to the cell nucleus involves the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins. IFN-activated STAT1 and STAT2 translocate to the nucleus, where they recognize the conserved IFN stimulus response element (ISRE) within the promoter of ISGs, which is both necessary and sufficient for ISG transcription(2.Schindler C.

Central to the type I IFN-activated pathway are two non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, which apparently mediate the tyrosine phosphorylation of IFN receptor chains and STATs(4.Muller M.

Recent studies indicate that many cytokines, including type I IFNs, induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT3 transcription factor(8.Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.-J. Wei S. Matsusaka T.

We previously proposed that the intracellular domain of the IFNAR-1 chain plays a critical role in type I IFN signaling by specifically docking important SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic proteins(6.Constantinescu S.N.

Therefore, we investigated the possible role of STAT3 in IFNα signaling through the IFNAR-1 chain. The type I IFN receptor apparently consists of multiple glycoprotein subunits(6.Constantinescu S.N.

We show that STAT3 associates with the IFNAR-1 chain in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner after exposure of cells to IFN. The binding of STAT3 to the IFNAR-1 chain can occur through a direct interaction between the SH2 domain-containing portion of STAT3 and tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chain. The biological significance of IFN activation of STAT3 is further borne out by the finding that STAT3 is the only signaling molecule in the JAK-STAT pathway not activated by IFNα in an IFNα-resistant cell line. Human Daudi and U266 cells were maintained at 2.5-10 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 containing 10% defined bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Human HeLa-S3 cells were grown in stirred suspension culture in spinner medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. The activity of recombinant human IFNα (IFNCon1), provided by AMGEN, is expressed in international reference units (IU)/ml as assayed by protection against the cytopathic effect of vesicular stomatitis virus on human fibroblasts, using the NIH human IFNα standard for reference. mAbs directed against the extracellular domain of the IFNAR-1 chain have been described previously(6.Constantinescu S.N.

Nuclei were extracted with buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.85, 250 mM sucrose, 0.4 M KCl, 1.1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and extracts were frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C(16.Improta T.

For gel shift analysis, the nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-end-labeled promoter probe for either the high affinity sis-inducible element (SIE) from the c-fos gene (5′-AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′) or the ISRE from ISG15 (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) (19.Reich N.C.

For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 1:50 dilution of normal rabbit serum, anti-STAT1 (αSTAT1, Santa Cruz Laboratories), anti-STAT2 (αSTAT2, Santa Cruz Laboratories), or anti-STAT3 (αSTAT3) at 25°C for 0.5 h. Gels were quantitated by PhosphorImager autoradiography. A segment encoding residues 498-770 from a human STAT3 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and SacI sites of pGEX-KG(21.Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). The construct was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. The fusion protein (STAT3-GST) was obtained from Escherichia coli transformed with the plasmid construct and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described previously(22.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4985) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, 1 × 108 cells were treated with IFNα (5,000 IU/ml) at 37°C for the indicated periods of time and then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol) containing 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.75 μg/ml benzamidine(3.Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min) at 4°C, and supernatants were immunoprecipitated with αSTAT3, anti-phosphotyrosine (αTyr(P), Oncogene Sciences Ab-2), or anti-IFNAR-1 (αIFNAR-1) overnight at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected using Protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) and eluted in sample buffer. Samples were run on SDS, 7.5% PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), and probed with αSTAT3 mAb (dilution, 1:1000), followed by anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Corp.). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For precipitation with GST fusion proteins, lysates from control or IFN-treated Daudi cells were precipitated with STAT3-GST or GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), blotted onto PVDF membranes, and probed with αIFNAR-1. For blotting with GST fusion proteins, αIFNAR-1 immunoprecipitates resolved by SDS-PAGE were probed with STAT3-GST or GST (purified after elution with glutathione from agarose beads). The IFNAR-1 chain was visualized by ECL using a hamster αGST mAb and a goat anti-hamster IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Nuclear extracts prepared from IFN-sensitive Daudi cells treated with IFNα were incubated with a labeled probe for either the high affinity SIE or the ISRE, and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Fig. 1 shows that treatment with IFNα induced the STAT-related DNA binding factors, sis-inducible factor (SIF)-A, SIF-B, and SIF-C, as well as IFN-stimulated gene factors (ISGFs). No DNA binding to the SIE was detected in the presence of excess unlabeled SIE oligonucleotide, and binding was not competed by an excess of ISRE oligonucleotide. Similarly, no DNA binding to the ISRE probe was detected in the presence of excess ISRE oligonucleotide, and binding was not competed by the SIE oligonucleotide. Taken together these results indicate that the binding to each probe was specific. To detect specific STAT proteins in the IFN-inducible DNA-protein complexes, we performed gel supershift assays with various STAT-specific antisera (αSTAT). Previous studies showed that the ISRE-specific ISGF3 factor contains only STAT1 and STAT2 but not STAT3 (1.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, we found that the ISGF3 complex was not supershifted with αSTAT3 but was supershifted by either αSTAT1 or αSTAT2 (data not shown). However, a distinct slowly migrating DNA-protein complex formed with the ISRE, denoted ISGFX in Fig. 1, was supershifted by αSTAT3. In addition, αSTAT3 supershifted SIF-A and SIF-B formed with the SIE in IFN-treated Daudi cells, while αSTAT1 supershifted SIF-C(23.Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1743Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 24.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Neither control normal rabbit serum nor αSTAT2 shifted any of the IFN-induced SIE DNA-protein complexes. Thus, IFNα treatment of Daudi cells induced DNA binding activities attributable to STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, and possibly additional unknown factor(s). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is essential for their DNA binding activity and their translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus(1.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4764) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to IFN, cell lysates were precipitated with αSTAT3 and analyzed by blotting with αTyr(P) (Fig. 2). Although similar amounts of STAT3 from both IFN-treated and untreated cells were precipitated by αSTAT3, only αSTAT3 precipitates from IFN-treated cells contained tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3. Furthermore, a doublet of STAT3 was observed, as illustrated in Fig. 2B. The more slowly migrating STAT3 band reportedly represents a secondary modification of STAT3 involving serine phosphorylation(25.Boulton T. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the IFNAR-1 chain undergoes IFN-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation(6.Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition, several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins coprecipitate with the IFNAR-1 chain. To determine if STAT3 coprecipitated with IFNAR-1, lysates from control and IFN-treated Daudi cells were precipitated with αIFNAR-1 and analyzed by blotting with αSTAT3 (Fig. 2). Although similar amounts of IFNAR-1 chain were precipitated by αIFNAR-1 (data not shown), only αIFNAR-1 precipitates from IFN-treated cells contained STAT3 protein (Fig. 2). Furthermore, blotting with αTyr(P) indicated that the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNAR-1 and STAT3 were remarkably similar. IFN-dependent coprecipitation of STAT3 with the IFNAR-1 chain was also observed in HeLa epithelioid carcinoma cells and U-266 lymphoblastoid cells (data not shown). As observed in αSTAT3 precipitates, the STAT3 band precipitated by αIFNAR-1 resolved as a doublet. This result directly places the kinase responsible for the secondary modification of STAT3 (serine phosphorylation) in close proximity to the IFNAR-1 chain of the receptor. Recently, it has been shown that IFN also induces the serine phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3(25.Boulton T. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), an event that is necessary for maximal activation of transcription(26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Since we previously showed that IFNα activates the ε and δ subspecies of PKC in IFN-sensitive Daudi cells and that PKC plays a role in IFNα action in these cells(27.Pfeffer L.M. Eisenkraft B.L. Reich N.C. Improta T. Baxter G. Daniel-Issakani S. Strulovici B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7988-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), ( 2L. M. Pfeffer, M. K. Dahmer, C. Wang, R. Pine, N. C. Reich, A. Murti, D. J. MacEwan, and S. N. Constantinescu, submitted for publication.) we investigated the role of PKC in the serine phosphorylation of STAT3. The serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is readily detectable because it results in the presence of a doublet of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Since at low concentrations H-7 is a selective inhibitor of PKC(29.Hidaka H. Hagiwara M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1987; 8: 162-164Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (136) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of pretreatment of Daudi cells with various concentrations of H-7 on the IFN-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 doublet. As shown in Fig. 2B, H-7 caused a dramatic disappearance of the slower mobility, upper STAT3 band at concentrations of 10 μM or less, with a 50% inhibition observed at 3 μM, which is consistent with an inhibitory effect of H-7 on PKC. In addition, pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine also blocked the secondary modification of STAT3, and thus only the faster mobility tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT3 is detected. At high concentrations staurosporine (200 nM) and H-7 (30 μM) also block the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK protein tyrosine kinases ( 3C-H. Yang and L. M. Pfeffer, unpublished observations.) and thus inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 2B). Thus, these results suggest that an IFN-activated PKC may mediate the serine phosphorylation of STAT3. We are currently evaluating whether PKC subspecies or other serine kinases are physically associated with the type I IFN receptor. STAT3 contains an SH2 domain(3.Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), a modular noncatalytic domain of about 100 amino acid residues, that mediates high affinity interactions of cytoplasmic effectors with specific phosphotyrosine motifs in activated cell surface receptors(30.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 31.Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 434-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of conserved motifs present in cytokine receptor subunits creates multifunctional docking sites for SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic effectors(6.Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32.Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D.

Cell. 1993; 74: 227-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Since the IFNAR-1 chain undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and associates with STAT3, one likely possibility is that this interaction involves the SH2 domain of STAT3. Although the phosphopeptide specificity of many SH2 domain-containing proteins has been determined, attempts to define the phosphopeptide specificity of the SH2 domains of STATs have been unsuccessful(34.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neil B.G. Birge R.G. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar). Recent structural and functional studies on the Src family tyrosine kinases Lck and Fyn have demonstrated important interactions between SH2 domains and adjacent protein structures (i.e. SH3 domains)(35.Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 36.Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Stolz L. Payne G. Reedquist K. Shoelson S. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Walsh C. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6372-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared a GST fusion protein (STAT3-GST) that encompasses the SH2 and SH3 domains of STAT3, as well as carboxyl-terminal residues. Lysates were prepared from IFN-treated Daudi cells and incubated with STAT3-GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads. The material bound was analyzed by blotting with αIFNAR-1. As shown in Fig. 3, IFN treatment resulted in binding of the IFNAR-1 chain to the SH2 domain-containing STAT3-GST. Pretreatment of cells with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, blocked interaction of the IFNAR-1 chain with STAT3-GST, demonstrating that tyrosine phosphorylation of IFNAR-1 is required for interaction with the fusion protein. The specificity of the interaction is further illustrated by the finding that IFNAR-1 chain was not bound to GST protein alone. To show that STAT3 can directly interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chain, αIFNAR-1 precipitates were blotted with STAT3-GST. STAT3-GST bound only to tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chain, since binding was only detected after IFN treatment and was abolished by pretreatment with genistein. In contrast, blotting with GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Abl, Crk, or GTPase-activating protein did not show any interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chains (data not shown). We then examined the activation of STAT3 by IFNα in a Daudi subline, which is highly resistant to the antiviral and antiproliferative action of IFNα. In contrast to the results obtained with IFN-sensitive cells, IFNα did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig. 4). This is in spite of the fact that IFN-resistant Daudi cells contain similar levels of STAT3 when compared with IFN-sensitive Daudi cells (Figure 2:, Figure 3:, Figure 4:). The failure of IFN to activate STAT3 in IFN-resistant cells was also demonstrated in gel shift assays. Nuclear extracts prepared from IFN-resistant Daudi cells treated with IFNα were incubated with a labeled probe for the high affinity SIE, and the resultant DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by the EMSA. Fig. 4 shows that treatment of IFN-resistant Daudi with IFNα only induced the STAT1-related DNA binding factor SIF-C. SIF-C was supershifted with αSTAT1 sera demonstrating its presence in the protein-DNA complex. This is in sharp contrast to the findings with IFN-sensitive Daudi cells where STAT3-containing protein-DNA complexes SIF-A and SIF-B were also induced by IFN treatment. The binding of cytokines to cell surface receptors on target cells induces the transcription of specific sets of genes. This new gene expression involves the cytokine-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of specific subsets of STAT transcription factors and the formation of phosphorylation-dependent STAT complexes. The mechanism by which a cytokine and its cognate receptor selectively activate only certain STATs is poorly understood, but several lines of evidence indicate that it involves intermediate phosphotyrosine- and SH2 domain-dependent complexes between the receptor chain and specific STAT factors. For example, IFNγ induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNGR-1 chain of the multisubunit IFNγ receptor as well as of STAT1(37.Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A functionally critical tyrosine residue in the membrane distal region of the IFNGR-1 chain is involved in STAT1 activation. Furthermore, phosphopeptides corresponding to this region interact with STAT1 and block its activation. These results were the first to show that a specific tyrosine-based activation motif (TBM) in the cytosolic tail of an IFN receptor subunit dictated specific STAT activation. The results reported herein establish that IFNα activates STAT3 directly through an interaction between the tyrosine-phosphorylated IFNAR-1 chain and the SH2 domain-containing half of STAT3. It is likely that STAT3 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by the receptor-associated JAK1 or TYK2 kinases. Most importantly, we demonstrate a direct association of a STAT with a cytokine receptor chain and thus provide a mechanism whereby cytokine receptors dictate signaling specificity. The IFNAR-1 chain of the type I IFN receptor undergoes ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation and plays a crucial role in signal transduction(6.Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A.

Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10487-10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails of the mouse, human, and bovine IFNAR-1 chains contain a perfectly conserved membrane distal amino acid motif, KYSSQTSQDSGNYSNE(6.Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7.Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 20: 55-56Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We previously proposed that this TBM plays a critical role in the signaling of type I IFN through its receptor by specifically docking important SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic proteins(6.Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Wang C. Murti A. Basu L. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9602-9606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that a TBM of YXXQ in the cytosolic tail of the shared signal-transducing gp130 chain of the IL6 receptor family is required for cytokine-dependent STAT3 activation(40.Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the conserved YSSQ motif of the cytosolic tail of the IFNAR-1 chain may also serve as a docking site for STAT3. We are presently investigating whether this motif in fact is the STAT3 docking site on the IFNAR-1 chain. STAT3 also undergoes serine phosphorylation(25.Boulton T. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6915-6919Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), a modification that was blocked in Daudi cells by serine kinase inhibitors (H-7 and staurosporine) in IFN-treated cells. Thus, we can place both serine and tyrosine protein kinases in the vicinity of the type I IFN receptor and in early transmembrane signaling events. Furthermore, the IC50 for inhibitory action of H-7 on IFN-induced STAT3 serine phosphorylation suggests that PKC may mediate the serine phosphorylation of STAT3. We have previously shown that, although Daudi cells express PKCα, -β, -δ, -α, -ζ, and -θ, IFNα selectively activates PKCδ and PKCα(27.Pfeffer L.M. Eisenkraft B.L. Reich N.C. Improta T. Baxter G. Daniel-Issakani S. Strulovici B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7988-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).2 Thus, it is tempting to suggest that either one or both IFN-activated PKC subspecies may mediate the phosphorylation of STAT3. Recently, it has been shown that the serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is necessary for maximal activation of transcription(26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). Finally, although much attention has been focused on the role of STAT1 and STAT2 in IFNα action, our results suggest that STAT3 is also involved in the biological actions of IFN. We previously reported that IFNα rapidly induces ISG transcription in IFN-sensitive and IFN-resistant Daudi cells(17.Kessler D.S. Pine R. Pfeffer L.M. Levy D.E. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3779-3783Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28.Wang C. Constantinescu S.N. MacEwan D.J. Strulovici B. Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6944-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, while ISG transcription persists at high levels in the IFN-sensitive Daudi line, the activation of ISG transcription is only transient in IFN-resistant Daudi cells. IFN-resistant Daudi cells undergo the normal activation of other components of the JAK-STAT pathway, as determined by the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2, JAK1, and TYK2.2 It is of note that the ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNAR-1 chain was reduced in IFN-resistant Daudi cells when compared with IFN-sensitive cells. In the present report we show that, although IFN activates STAT3 in IFN-sensitive Daudi cells, STAT3 was not activated in the IFN-resistant line when assayed by STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation or by formation of STAT3-containing protein-DNA complexes in gel supershift assays. We provide evidence for a direct phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction between the IFNAR-1 chain of the human type I interferon receptor and the SH2 domain-containing portion of STAT3. This association is required for the formation of functional STAT3-containing transcription factors in response to interferon-α. We thank Drs. J. E. Darnell, Jr. (Rockefeller University) for providing αSTAT3 and B. 5er (Harvard University) for providing GST fusion proteins containing the SH2 domains of Abl, Crk, or GTPase-activating protein."

Most of the evidence of calmodulin dependence has been indirect, based on the use of calmodulin antagonists and on activation studies with exogenous calmodulin(1.Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1381-1384Google Scholar) reported a homolog of mammalian CaMKII from plants, but the biochemical properties of this kinase are not known. CCaMK is a novel ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase characterized by two distinct regulatory domains; a visinin-like domain is regulated by ca2+, while the other is regulated by ca2+/calmodulin. The visinin-like domain of CCaMK contains three conserved ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs, similar to neural visinin-like proteins(18.Yamagata K. Goto K. Kuo C.-H. Kondo H. Miki N. Neuron. 1990; 4: 469-476Google Scholar, 19.Kuno T. Kajimoto Y. Hashimoto T. Mukai H. Shirai Y. Saheki S. Tanaka C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 184: 1219-1225Google Scholar), which are members of a family of ca2+-sensitive regulators. The chimeric feature of CCaMK with three distinct domains in a single polypeptide suggests that it has evolved from a fusion of two genes that are functionally different in origin. The CCaMK gene is preferentially expressed during anther development, and it is regulated in a stage-specific manner during microsporogenesis, which implies that it may play a central role in the development of the male gametophyte(20.Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4797-4801Google Scholar). Here we report the biochemical properties of CCaMK, which has structural features resembling both mammalian ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and plant ca2+-dependent protein kinases. The results presented here show a dual mode of regulation of CCaMK by ca2+ and ca2+/calmodulin.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli cells were harvested and suspended in a homogenization buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain). Cells were broken by freeze thawing followed by sonication. Subsequent procedures were carried out at 4°C. The cell extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Solid ammonium sulfate (50% saturation) was added to the supernatant and incubated on ice for 1-4 h. The enzyme was recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g. The pellet was solubilized in the column buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and antipain) and applied onto a calmodulin-Sepharose column, which was previously equilibrated with the column buffer. The column was washed first with the column buffer and then with the column buffer containing 1 M NaCl. CCaMK was eluted from the column with buffer containing 40 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1.5 mM EGTA, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.05% Tween 20, 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions containing the CCaMK were pooled and thoroughly dialyzed against buffer containing 40 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, and 10% ethylene glycol. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli(21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 237: 680-685Google Scholar). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis was performed using 14% separating gel in 375 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 5% stacking gel in 125 mM Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, and 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine electrophoresis buffer, pH 8.3, at 80 V for 8 h.

Wild-type and mutant CCaMK proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose filters and incubated in binding buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) containing 35S-calmodulin (0.5 × 106 cpm/μg) plus either 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EGTA as described previously(20.Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4797-4801Google Scholar). Binding assays using biotinylated calmodulin were performed as described previously by Reddy et al.(24.Reddy A.S.N. Takezawa D. Fromm H. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Sci. 1993; 94: 109-117Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides were prepared using Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer 431A in the Laboratory of Bioanalysis and Biotechnology, Washington State University. Different lengths of synthetic peptides were incubated with 100 pmol (1.7 μg) of calmodulin in 10 μl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, for 5 min and analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mutant construct 1-356 was created by removing a 0.9-kilobase pair BamHI fragment containing the visinin-like domain from the original CCaMK expression plasmid pNY10. The mutant construct 1-322 was created by introducing a BglII site using an oligonucleotide 5′-GCATTGAAAGATCTCAGTCTAGAAAC-3′. The construct was then inserted into the pET14b expression vector. The mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using either calmodulin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) or Ni2+-resin column from Novagen, Inc. and the protocol provided by the manufacturer. A 0.9-kilobase pair BamHI fragment containing the visinin-like domain of CCaMK was subcloned into M13mp18 RF, and the site-directed mutagenesis was performed(25.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used for the site-directed mutagenesis were 5′-CTCTCATGGCTATAGTTCC-3′ for EF-hand I mutation, 5′-CCTCCTTGGCGATACATCC-3′ for EF-hand II mutation, and 5′-GTCGAACGCGACAACTCC-3′for EF-hand III mutation. An NdeI site was created at the position of amino acid residue 358 (Met) using 5′-GGATCCCATCATATGAAATCG-3′. Wild-type and the mutant constructs were then inserted into the pET14b expression vector. All mutant sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the fmol PCR sequencing kit (Promega). Phosphorylation assays (25 μl) were carried out at 30°C in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 200 μM [γ-32P]ATP (1,500-2,000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of either 2.5 mM EGTA or indicated amounts of Ca2+ and calmodulin. Protein (0.2 mg/ml) and synthetic peptides (100 μM) were added in the reaction mixture to study substrate phosphorylation. When protein substrates were used, the reaction was terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 237: 680-685Google Scholar) and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Incorporation of 32P into the substrate was determined by counting the excised protein bands in a liquid scintillation counter. When peptide substrates were used, the reaction was terminated by spotting the reaction mixture on P81 phosphocellulose filters (Whatman). The filters were washed in 75 mM phosphoric acid, and 32P incorporation was determined(26.Roskoski Jr., R. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 3-6Google Scholar). The autophosphorylation assay was carried out at 30°C in the presence of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (300-400 cpm/pmol), and either EGTA (2.5 mM), CaCl2 (0.5 mM), or CaCl2 (0.5 mM) plus calmodulin (1 μM). For time course assays (100 μl), 1.2 μg (21.4 pmol) of CCaMK and 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2,000-3,000 cpm/pmol) were used. Aliquots (10 μl) were transferred at indicated time points into SDS-PAGE sample buffer to stop the reaction. Aliquots for the zero time point were taken immediately after the addition of CCaMK. The samples were then analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of phosphate transferred to the enzyme was determined by counting the radioactivity of the excised CCaMK bands in a liquid scintillation counter. The purified CCaMK (200 ng) was autophosphorylated in the presence of EGTA (2.5 mM) or CaCl2 (0.5 mM) or CaCl2 (0.5 mM) plus 1 μM calmodulin and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was briefly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, CCaMK bands were excised, and the protein was eluted from the gel. The eluted protein was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl for 2 h at 110°C and subjected to paper chromatography using propionic acid, 1 M NH4OH, isopropyl alcohol (45:17.5:17.5) as a solvent(27.Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 387-402Google Scholar). Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine standards (5 mg/ml in 10% (w/v) isopropyl alcohol) were visualized by ninhydrin reagent. To study the ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity of CCaMK, the E. coli-expressed protein was purified. The protein was essentially pure as revealed by SDS-PAGE and was stable at 4°C for a few days. The purified protein was used to phosphorylate different substrates such as casein, histones, myelin basic protein, and synthetic peptides. Histone IIAS was found to be the most reactive protein substrate for CCaMK and was used for studying calmodulin concentration-dependent protein kinase activity. The addition of increasing amounts of calmodulin in the presence of 0.5 mM ca2+ stimulated CCaMK activity (Fig. 1A). Kinase activity was saturated at calmodulin concentrations around 1.0 μM. The concentration of calmodulin required for half-maximal activity (Ka) of CCaMK was approximately 0.2 μM. The time course studies revealed that histone IIAS phosphorylation was saturated after 10 min in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (Fig. 1B). In the presence of 2.5 mM EGTA or 0.5 mM Ca2+ alone, the enzyme has basal activity that is 10-15-fold lower than the maximal activity achieved with Ca2+/calmodulin. Among other protein substrates tested, CCaMK phosphorylated histone IIIS and myelin basic protein, but it did not phosphorylate phosvitin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, synapsin I, and casein. CCaMK also phosphorylated synthetic peptides such as GS peptide, myelin basic protein peptide, and syntide-2. Among these peptides, GS peptide was most efficiently phosphorylated by CCaMK in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin. Calmodulin-binding affinity of the CCaMK was studied by using different concentrations of 35S-labeled calmodulin. Binding of calmodulin to CCaMK saturated at concentrations above 300 nM (Fig. 2). From the saturation curve, the dissociation constant (Kd) of calmodulin for CCaMK was estimated to be around 55 nM. The binding of calmodulin to CCaMK was completely blocked in the presence of 5 mM EGTA. The Scatchard analysis indicated that CCaMK has a single calmodulin binding site. (Fig. 2, inset). To identify the calmodulin-binding region of CCaMK, truncated mutant constructs were prepared (Fig. 3A). The CCaMK mutant 1-356 lacks the COOH-terminal domain, which has high homology to visinin-like proteins. Another CCaMK mutant, 1-322, is further truncated, but it has all 11 domains conserved in serine/threonine protein kinases(28.Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Google Scholar). Wild-type CCaMK(1-520), and truncated mutants 1-356 and 1-322 were expressed in E. coli and purified as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” These proteins were used for 35S-calmodulin binding assays in the presence of Ca2+. The binding of calmodulin to wild-type and mutant 1-356 CCaMKs were similar; whereas, calmodulin did not bind to the mutant CCaMK 1-322 (Fig. 3A, boxed region), indicating that amino acid residues 322-356 (Fig. 3A) are essential for calmodulin-binding to CCaMK. Another mutant CCaMK 1-341 also binds to calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when biotinylated calmodulin was used instead of S-calmodulin. Calmodulin binding to wild-type and mutant CCaMKs was prevented by the addition of 5 mM EGTA, indicating the requirement of Ca2+ for calmodulin binding. Comparison of amino acid residues of this region of CCaMK corresponding to regions of animal CaMKIIα revealed high homology (Fig. 3B). Different lengths of synthetic peptides from the calmodulin-binding region (amino acid residues 311-340) were used to identify amino acid residues necessary for calmodulin binding. Calmodulin binding to these peptides was studied by gel mobility shift assay using nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Calmodulin mixed with peptides 311-340, 317-340, and 322-340 migrated above the position of calmodulin alone; whereas, peptide 328-340 did not affect the mobility of calmodulin (Fig. 3C, top), suggesting that the calmodulin-binding site exists between amino acid residues 322-340. The addition of these peptides to calmodulin in the presence of 2.5 mM EGTA did not affect the mobility of calmodulin, suggesting that peptide binding to calmodulin is Ca2+-dependent. Increasing amounts of the peptide 322-340 facilitates the gel mobility shift toward the upper position (Fig. 3C, bottom). Similar results were obtained when the peptides 317-340 and 311-340 were used, suggesting that the amino acid residues 322-340 have a pivotal role in calmodulin binding of CCaMK. The helical wheel projection revealed that amino acid residues 325-338 of CCaMK form a basic amphiphilic α-helix (29.O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Google Scholar) similar to CaMKIIα (Fig. 3D). To study autophosphorylation, CCaMK was incubated at 30°C with 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM [γ-2P]ATP, and 2.5 mM EGTA. In 30 min, approximately 0.098 mol of 32P/mol of CCaMK was incorporated. This basal autophosphorylation was induced to approximately 3.4-fold in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2 (0.339 mol of 32P/mol of CCaMK) (Fig. 4A). Increasing the incubation time to 60 min did not improve the stoichiometry of Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation. Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation was inhibited to the basal level (0.061 mol of 32P/mol of CCaMK) by the addition of 1 μM calmodulin (Fig. 4A). Calmodulin inhibits Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that Ca2+ and calmodulin have opposing effects on autophosphorylation of CCaMK. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that CCaMK autophosphorylates at the threonine residue(s) (Fig. 4C), which was stimulated by Ca2+ and inhibited by Ca2+/calmodulin. Apart from the calmodulin-binding domain, CCaMK has another regulatory domain toward the COOH terminus, which has high homology to animal visinin-like proteins. The visinin-like domain of CCaMK contains three EF-hand motifs with conserved Ca2+-ligating amino acid residues (Fig. 5A). To study Ca2+-binding properties of the visinin-like domain of CCaMK, recombinant visinin-like domain protein was expressed in E. coli, using the pET14b expression vector. The visinin-like domain protein was expressed to high levels upon induction with 0.5 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and most of the protein was present in the soluble fraction. The expressed protein was purified using the Ni2+ resin column. The protein eluted from the column with 1 M imidazole buffer was dialyzed in 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and used for Ca2+-dependent mobility shift assay. Electrophoretic mobility of the recombinant visinin-like domain protein was just above the 20.1-kDa molecular weight marker in the presence of 2.5 mM EGTA; whereas, the addition of Ca2+ shifted the electrophoretic mobility toward the lower molecular weight (Fig. 5B). This suggests that Ca2+ binding to the recombinant visinin-like domain protein induces a conformational change. To verify that the EF-hand motifs in the visinin-like domain are responsible for the Ca2+-dependent mobility shift, site-directed mutants of the visinin-like domain protein were created. Each of the EF-hands (I, II, and III) were mutated by replacing the amino acid residue at the -x position (D417A, S453A, and T495A) in the EF-hands (Fig. 5A), which are known to be primary determinants of the Ca2+ dissociation rate (30.Renner M. Danielson M.A. Falke J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6493-6497Google Scholar). The mutant in which all three EF-hands are mutated was expressed in E. coli and purified, and the protein was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence of Ca2+. The visinin-like protein mutated in the EF-hand I migrated at a similar position to the wild-type protein, suggesting that this site may not be functional. However, mutations in EF-hands II and III shifted the mobility of the protein toward the higher molecular weight. The mutant of the EF-hand III migrated to a similar position to the protein in which all three EF-hands are mutated (Fig. 5B). The migration of EF-hand III mutant in the presence of Ca2+ was also similar to the wild-type protein in the absence of Ca2+. These results suggest that Ca2+ binding to the EF-hands II and III contribute to the Ca2+-dependent mobility shift of the visinin-like domain protein. Removal of Ca2+ by EGTA shifts the mobility of all the mutant proteins to similar positions toward the higher molecular weight (data not shown). To study the role of the visinin-like domain in Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation, the CCaMK mutant 1-356 lacking the visinin-like domain was used for autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. Autophosphorylation of mutant 1-356 was not stimulated by Ca2+ (Fig. 6, A and C); however, it retained Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity at a substantially reduced level (Fig. 6, B and D). This indicates that the visinin-like domain is required for Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation as well as for maximal substrate phosphorylation. In order to understand the significance of Ca2+-stimulated autophosphorylation, the autophosphorylated CCaMK was used to study its effect on substrate phosphorylation. First we attempted to study the activity of the autophosphorylated CCaMK using histone IIAS as a substrate. However, in the presence of histone IIAS, calmodulin did not suppress the Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation of CCaMK. It is probable that histone IIAS was interacting with acidic proteins such as calmodulin and the visinin-like domain of CCaMK. Therefore, we used GS peptide as a substrate for studying the activity of autophosphorylated CCaMK. The rate of phosphorylation of the GS peptide by unphosphorylated CCaMK was stimulated by increasing concentrations of calmodulin, but the maximal stimulation was only 3-4-fold higher as compared with the basal activity. However, when autophosphorylated CCaMK was used, calmodulin stimulated the rate of phosphorylation of the GS peptide with similar kinetics as histone IIAS (Fig. 7A). To study the effect of autophosphorylation on kinase activity using GS peptide as substrate, we compared Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent and Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity of autophosphorylated to unphosphorylated CCaMKs. Autophosphorylated CCaMK exhibits approximately 5-fold increased Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity as compared with the unphosphorylated enzyme. The maximal stimulation of autophosphorylated CCaMK by Ca2+/calmodulin was 20-25-fold as compared with the EGTA control (Fig. 7B). Ca2+/calmodulin-independent activity was not significantly affected by autophosphorylation. These results suggest that Ca2+-induced autophosphorylation stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent activity of CCaMK. This report provides the biochemical evidence for a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in plants. Although several Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases have been characterized from animal systems(10.Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 295-303Google Scholar), CCaMK is the only plant kinase whose activity is regulated by both Ca2+ and Ca2+/calmodulin. Among the substrates tested, histone IIAS and synthetic GS peptide are the most efficient phosphate acceptors. CCaMK exhibits a higher Ka value (150-200 nM) for calmodulin (Fig. 1A and Fig. 7A) compared with CaMKII (20-100 nM) (31.Schulman H. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 39-112Google Scholar) and CaMKIV (26-150 nM)(32.Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 583-590Google Scholar, 33.Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D. Soderling S.H. Klamo E. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15520-15527Google Scholar), indicating that plant kinase requires a higher concentration of calmodulin for its activity. This is probably due to a higher dissociation constant of calmodulin for CCaMK (55 nM) than for animal Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (1-10 nM)(34.Sikela J.M. Hahn W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3038-3042Google Scholar). 35S-Labeled calmodulin binding and peptide binding assays revealed that calmodulin binding site of CCaMK is present between amino acid residues 322 and 340 (Fig. 3). This region has homology to animal CaMKII, with conserved basic (Arg-326, Arg-327, and Lys-328) as well as hydrophobic (Phe-323, Ala-325, Ala-332, and Leu-338) amino acid residues. The visinin-like Ca2+-binding domain, a novel feature of CCaMK, is not known to exist in other protein kinases. The visinin-like domain contains three EF-hand motifs (Fig. 5A) similar to animal visinin-like proteins. Frequenin, neurocalcin, and visinin-like proteins are known to be members of Ca2+-sensitive guanylyl cyclase activators that are involved in cation channel regulation in neuronal tissues(35.Palczewski K. Subbaraya I. Gorczca W.A. Helekar B.S. Ruiz C.C. Ohguro H. Huang J. Zhao X. Crabb J.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-404Google Scholar). Visinin-like proteins typically contain three conserved EF-hand motifs, each with different affinities to Ca2+(36.Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Engelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambecht H.G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A. Neuron. 1993; 11: 15-28Google Scholar, 37.Ames J.B. Porumb T. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4526-4533Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent mobility shift assay suggests that binding of Ca2+ to the EF-hands II and III is important for inducing conformational changes in the visinin-like domain of CCaMK (Fig. 5B). Ca2+-induced conformational change in the visinin-like domain may be critical for regulation of CCaMK activity. The CCaMK mutant 1-356 lacking this domain did not show Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation. The mutant 1-356 also exhibited reduced activity as compared with the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the visinin-like domain is required for the maximal activation of CCaMK. It is unlikely that this reduced activity is due to lowered affinity of mutant 1-356 to calmodulin, since the saturation curve of 35S-calmodulin binding for mutant 1-356 indicated that it has a similar Kd (60 nM) for calmodulin (data not shown). However, it is possible that the visinin-like domain may stabilize the conformation of CCaMK, which is indispensable for its maximal activity. The suppression of Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation of CCaMK by Ca2+/calmodulin is intriguing. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that CCaMK autophosphorylation is due to the phosphorylation of the threonine residue(s) (Fig. 4C). Autophosphorylation of CCaMK increased its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity by 5-fold (Fig. 7B). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent autophosphorylation of animal CaMKII at Thr-286 NH2-terminal to the calmodulin binding site is known to stimulate Ca2+-independent activity(11.Colbran R.J. Soderling T.R. Curr. Topics Cell Regul. 1990; 31: 181-221Google Scholar, 38.Theil G. Czernik A.J. Gorelick F. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6337-6341Google Scholar, 39.Fong Y.-L. Taylor W.L. Means A.R. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16759-16763Google Scholar). In contrast, Ca2+/calmodulin-independent basal autophosphorylation at Thr-305 and −306 within the calmodulin-binding site inactivates CaMKII by inhibiting its ability to bind calmodulin(40.Leckteig R. Shenolikar S. Denner L. Kelly P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19232-19239Google Scholar, 41.Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7163-7170Google Scholar). Although the calmodulin binding region of CCaMK has similarity to the calmodulin-binding region of CaMKII, there are no threonine residues around this area (Fig. 3A). The inhibition of the Ca2+-stimulated CCaMK autophosphorylation by calmodulin may be due to the conformational change induced by the calmodulin binding to CCaMK(42.James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Google Scholar). Inhibition of autophosphorylation by calmodulin is also reported in smooth muscle myosin light chain kinases(43.Tokui T. Ando S. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5173-5179Google Scholar), where all three phosphorylated residues are present in proximity to the calmodulin-binding site. The absence of threonine residues around the calmodulin-binding region of CCaMK suggests that the mechanism of CCaMK regulation by autophosphorylation is different from myosin light chain kinases and CaMKII. Signal-induced changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration are believed to be important for many cellular processes in plants(2.Gilroy S. Trewavas A. Trends Genet. 1994; 16: 677-682Google Scholar, 44.Bush D.S. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 7-13Google Scholar, 45.Gilroy S. Bethke P.C. Jones R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 453-462Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Ca2+ has a dual effect on the stimulation of CCaMK activity. In the presence of calmodulin, Ca2+ binds to calmodulin and stimulates CCaMK activity. In the absence of calmodulin, Ca2+ alone stimulates autophosphorylation of CCaMK, which further increases Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase activity (Fig. 7B). Plants have multiple isoforms of calmodulin, and their expression is developmentally regulated and responsive to environmental signals(22.Takezawa D. Liu Z.H. An G. Poovaiah B.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 693-703Google Scholar, 46.Jena P.K. Reddy A.S.N. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3644-3648Google Scholar, 47.Braam J. Davis R.W. Cell. 1990; 60: 357-364Google Scholar). Plant calmodulin mRNA and protein are also reported to have a relatively rapid turnover rate in the cell(48.Perera I.Y. Zielinski R.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 812-819Google Scholar). Signal-induced expression and rapid turnover suggest that there is a dynamic regulation of calmodulin in vivo. Therefore, it is likely that CCaMK activity is differentially controlled by signal-induced transient changes in free Ca2+ concentration and calmodulin. In plant cells, the Ca2+ concentration required for Ca2+-dependent autophosphorylation and the Ca2+ concentration required for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent substrate phosphorylation may be different. In order to determine how the two regulatory domains control kinase activity, the site(s) of autophosphorylation and the critical concentrations of Ca2+ required for substrate phosphorylation and autophosphorylation need to be determined. These experiments are currently being carried out. A unique feature of CCaMK is its stage-specific expression in developing anthers(20.Patil S. Takezawa D. Poovaiah B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4797-4801Google Scholar). We recently cloned a tobacco cDNA encoding a protein kinase with structural features similar to CCaMK, including calmodulin-binding and visinin-like Ca2+-binding domains. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the antisense RNA of this cDNA clone showed impaired pollen development, ( 2Z. H. Liu and B. W. Poovaiah, unpublished results.) indicating a crucial role for CCaMK in male gametophyte development. The Ca2+ signaling pathway in plants is receiving considerable attention and is beginning to be unraveled at the molecular and biochemical levels(1.Poovaiah B.W. Reddy A.S.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1993; 12: 185-211Google Scholar, 2.Gilroy S. Trewavas A. Trends Genet. 1994; 16: 677-682Google Scholar). The Ca2+-signaling pathway mediated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases is well established in animals. Unfortunately, calmodulin-binding proteins, especially the kinases, have not been well characterized in plants. Therefore, the discovery of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and the elucidation of its biochemical properties will impact future studies on the role of calmodulin in Ca2+-mediated signaling in plants.

https://openalex.org/W1540410753,"The aim of this investigation was to study the putative involvement of lipid second messengers, protein kinases, and transcription factors in interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-induced signal transduction in insulin-producing cells. For this purpose, insulin-producing RINm5F cells were exposed to IL-1β (25 units/ml), and the ceramide, ceramide 1-phosphate, sphingomyelin, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid contents of the cells were subsequently determined. It was found that IL-1β induced a transient increase (2-5 min) in ceramide and diacylglycerol, which was not paralleled by an increase in ceramide 1-phosphate and phosphatidic acid. A rapid decrease in the sphingomyelin content of the cells was, however, observed. The cell-permeable ceramide analogue N-acetylsphingosine and the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) both induced the phosphorylation and increased the activities of the protein kinase JNK1 and the transcription factor ATF2. These effects were, however, not as pronounced as those induced by IL-1β. The DNA binding activity of transcription factors in nuclear extracts was determined using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay method. Transcription factor binding to the ATF/cAMP-responsive element consensus sequence was increased 4-5-fold by acetylsphingosine, PMA, or IL-1β, whereas binding to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and AP-1 elements was found to be only slightly stimulated by these three agents. Binding to the NF-κB element was strongly induced by IL-1β, but not by acetylsphingosine or PMA. Finally, acetylsphingosine and PMA did not mimic the nitric oxide-inducing effects of IL-1β. It is concluded that IL-1β-stimulated formation of ceramide and diacylglycerol may contribute to JNK1 and ATF2 transcription factor activation, which may be a necessary (but not sufficient) step in β-cell nitric-oxide synthase induction.

These effects were, however, not as pronounced as those induced by IL-1β. The DNA binding activity of transcription factors in nuclear extracts was determined using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay method. Transcription factor binding to the ATF/cAMP-responsive element consensus sequence was increased 4-5-fold by acetylsphingosine, PMA, or IL-1β, whereas binding to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein and AP-1 elements was found to be only slightly stimulated by these three agents. Binding to the NF-κB element was strongly induced by IL-1β, but not by acetylsphingosine or PMA. Finally, acetylsphingosine and PMA did not mimic the nitric oxide-inducing effects of IL-1β. It is concluded that IL-1β-stimulated formation of ceramide and diacylglycerol may contribute to JNK1 and ATF2 transcription factor activation, which may be a necessary (but not sufficient) step in β-cell nitric-oxide synthase induction. INTRODUCTIONIt has been demonstrated that interleukin-1β (IL-1β) ( 1The abbreviations used are: IL-1βinterleukin-1βiNOSinducible nitric-oxide synthaseDTPAdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acidPBSphosphate-buffered salineDAGdiacylglycerolPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinCREBcAMP-responsive element-binding proteinATFactivating transcription factor.) exerts inhibitory and cytotoxic effects on rodent pancreatic beta cells in vitro(1.Bendtzen K.

This has led to the suggestion that this cytokine, alone or in combination with other cytokines, may be an important mediator of the autoimmune destruction of beta cells during the course of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus(4.Nerup J. Mandrup-Poulsen T. M⊘lvig J. Helqvist S. Wogensen L. Egeberg J. Diabetes Care. 1988; 11: 16-23Google Scholar, 5.Bendtzen K. Autoimmunity. 1989; 2: 177-189Google Scholar). The IL-1β effects are thought to be mediated by, at least in part, induction of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS)(6.Southern C. Schulster D. Green I.C. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 42-44Google Scholar, 7.Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Google Scholar). Nitric oxide production leads to inhibition of aconitase, glucose oxidation rates, ATP generation, and insulin production(2.Sandler S. Andersson A. Hellerström C. Endocrinology. 1987; 121: 1424-1431Google Scholar, 3.Sandler S. Bendtzen K. Borg L.A.H. Eizirik D.L. Strandell E. Welsh N. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 1492-1501Google Scholar, 7.Welsh N. Eizirik D.L.

J. 1992; 287: 229-235Google Scholar, 9.Welsh N. Sandler S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 333-340Google Scholar). The intracellular signals generated in insulin-producing cells by the interaction between IL-1β and its receptor have, however, not yet been elucidated.Sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation constitute a signal transduction pathway that mediates some of the effects of the cytokines IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α(10.Kolesnick R.N. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 232-237Google Scholar, 11.Kolesnick R.N. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin consists of sphingosine, a fatty acid, and a phosphocholine head group. Upon hydrolysis, the phosphocholine head group is released, and ceramide is formed. The ceramide generated by a cytokine-stimulated sphingomyelinase is thought to activate a 97-kDa proline-directed serine/threonine kinase(12.Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Domae N. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Google Scholar). Moreover, ceramide activation of this protein kinase has been reported to induce NF-κB, a stress response transcription factor(13.Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schütze S. Baeuerle P. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Google Scholar). In insulin-producing cells, indirect evidence has been presented suggesting a role of protein Ser-Thr and Tyr phosphorylation events (14.Welsh N. Biosci. Rep. 1994; 14: 43-50Google Scholar, 15.Corbett J.A. Sweetland M.A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. McDaniel M.L. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 369-374Google Scholar) leading to NF-κB activation (16.Saldeen J. Welsh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 149-155Google Scholar) and induction of iNOS(17.Eizirik D.L. Cagliero E. Björklund A. Welsh N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 249-252Google Scholar). Therefore, it was investigated here whether IL-1β stimulates sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation and whether this putative event may participate in IL-1β-induced transcription factor activation and the subsequent induction of iNOS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsHuman recombinant IL-1β was kindly provided by Dr. K. Bendtzen (Laboratory of Medical Immunology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen). The cytokine was produced by Immunex (Seattle, WA) and had a biological activity of 50 units/ng as compared with an interim international standard recombinant IL-1β preparation (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, London)(18.Svenson M. Bendtzen K. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 27: 593-599Google Scholar). The chemicals were obtained from the following sources: Sigma, sphingosine, ceramide, 1,2-diacylglycerol, sphingomyelin, acetic anhydride, octyl β-D-glucoside, cardiolipin, DTPA, sodium orthovanadate, okadaic acid, naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and sulfanilamide; Calbiochem, sn-1,2-diacylglycerol kinase; Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA), N-acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide); Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom), [γ-32P]ATP and [methyl-3H]choline chloride; and Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plates.Lipid ExtractionThe clonal rat insulin secretory cell line RINm5F was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium + 10% fetal calf serum. Approximately 1.0 × 106 RINm5F cells were exposed to 25 units/ml IL-1β for 0, 2, 5, and 20 min. The cells were then rapidly washed with cold PBS and sonicated in 400 μl of a chloroform solution consisting of chloroform/methanol/HCl (100:100:1, v/v) and 100 μl of PBS containing 10 mM EDTA. After centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, the aqueous phase was removed and re-extracted with 100 μl of chloroform, which was subsequently added to the chloroform phase. The combined chloroform phases were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and resolubilized in 40 μl of the chloroform solution. This solution was re-extracted with 10 μl of PBS with 10 mM EDTA and then re-evaporated. The samples were then stored at −70°C under nitrogen until analyzed for ceramide and 1,2-diacylglycerols.Assay for Ceramide and 1,2-DiacylglycerolCeramide and 1,2-diacylglycerols were quantified essentially according to Preiss et al.(19.Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipids were solubilized in 20 μl of an octyl β-D-glucoside/cardiolipin solution (7.5% octyl β-D-glucoside, 5 mM cardiolipin in 1 mM DTPA) by sonication in a sonicator bath. The reaction was then carried out in a final volume of 100 μl containing the 20-μl sample solution, 50 mM imidazole HCl, pH 6.6, 50 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 6.6 μg of DAG kinase, and 1 mM [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 1-5 × 105 cpm/nmol) for 30 min at room temperature. Lipids were extracted and evaporated as described above. Samples were then run on Kieselgel 60 plates activated by preheating at 120°C. Plates were developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v) and subjected to autoradiography. Standard samples of D-1,2-dipalmitin and ceramide were phosphorylated and developed in parallel. The intensities of the spots corresponding to ceramide 1-phosphate (RF= 0.38) and phosphatidic acid (RF= 0.57) were quantified by autoradiography and densitometry and were expressed as arbitrary units (absorbance).Assay for Sphingomyelin, Ceramide 1-Phosphate, and Phosphatidic AcidFor equilibrium-labeled studies, RINm5F cells were incubated for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium + 10% fetal calf serum containing 50 μCi/ml 32P (phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate) or 1 μCi/ml [3H]choline (sphingomyelin)(20.Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Google Scholar, 21.Mathias S. Younes A. Kan C.-C. Orlow I. Joseph C. Kolesnick R.N. Science. 1993; 259: 519-522Google Scholar). The cells were then exposed to 25 units/ml IL-1β for 0, 2, 5, and 20 min and rapidly washed with cold PBS. Lipids were extracted as described above, and glycerophospholipids were removed by incubation for 60 min at 37°C in 0.1 M methanolic potassium hydroxide. Phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate were resolved by TLC using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5, v/v) and sphingomyelin using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (60:30:8:5, v/v) as solvents. Individual lipids were visualized by iodine vapor staining and autoradiography, scraped off the plates, and quantified by liquid scintillation counting.N-Acetylsphingosine SynthesisN-Acetylsphingosine was synthesized as described previously(22.Gaver R.C. Sweeley C.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3643-3647Google Scholar). Briefly, 167 mg of sphingosine was allowed to react with 1 ml of acetic anhydride in 10 ml of methanol overnight. The reaction product was precipitated with 20 ml of water, washed, and filtered and then reprecipitated from a methanol solution by addition of water. The biological activity of synthesized N-acetylsphingosine was similar to that of a commercially available N-acetylsphingosine preparation (data not shown).JNK1 Phosphorylation AssayRINm5F cells (3 × 106) were labeled with 32P-labeled orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 10 μM phosphate, 16.7 mM glucose, and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 2 h. The cells were then exposed to 10 μM acetylsphingosine, 100 nM PMA, or 25 units/ml IL-1β for 20 min. After washings with cold PBS, the cells were solubilized in PBS containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 100 μM sodium orthovanadate. The homogenates were briefly sonicated, and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g. To remaining supernatants was added 25 μl of anti-JNK1 antibody linked to agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After 60 min, agarose conjugates were pelleted, washed in homogenization buffer, and boiled in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 100 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol). Samples were run on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.JNK1 Kinase AssayRINm5F cells that had been exposed to 10 μMN-acetylsphingosine, 100 nM PMA, and 25 units/ml IL-1β for 20 min were solubilized in 500 μl of cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were briefly sonicated and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatants were taken for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining to verify that similar amounts of protein were using for immunoprecipitation. To the remaining supernatants was added 25 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-JNK1 antibodies. After 60 min on ice, the agarose conjugates were washed three times with homogenization buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mM MOPS, pH 7.5, 7.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mM sodium orthovanadate)(23.Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μM ATP, and 1 μg of GST-c-Jun(79) (GST-c-Jun(79) construct generously provided by Dr. J. Silvio Gutkind) fusion protein as substrate. GST was run in parallel as a negative control. Reactions were carried out at 30°C for 20 min, after which 10 μl of 4 × SDS sample buffer was added. Samples were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed using autoradiography and densitometry.Immunoblot Analysis of ATF2RINm5F cells that had been exposed to 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μMN-acetylsphingosine, 100 nM PMA, and 25 units/ml IL-1β for 10, 20, and 60 min were solubilized in SDS/β-mercaptoethanol sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Samples were then run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters, which were then incubated with anti-ATF2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) diluted 1:1000 in PBS supplemented with 5% fat-free dry milk powder. Horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit Ig was used as a second layer. Immunodetection was performed as described for the ECL immunoblotting detection system (Amersham International). In a separate experiment, homogenates (100 μl) from control and IL-1β-exposed RINm5F cells were treated with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 5 min at 37°C prior to electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis.Preparation of Nuclear ExtractsRINm5F cells (5 × 106) were incubated with N-acetylsphingosine (1 or 10 μM), PMA (100 nM), or IL-1β (25 units/ml) for 20 min. Cells were then washed three times with cold PBS, harvested, and suspended in 100 μl of buffer A(24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). After 10 min at 4°C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and mechanically homogenized. Nuclei were pelleted (20 s at 12,000 × g) and briefly sonicated in 100 μl of buffer C (24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). After a brief centrifugation, the remaining supernatants were frozen until further use.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift AssayFor electrophoretic mobility shift assays of the transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, C/EBP, and ATF/CREB, the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were used: 5′-AGCTTCAGAGGGGACTTCCGAGAGG(16.Saldeen J. Welsh N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 149-155Google Scholar), 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), 5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATGGCCTT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and 5′-GATGAAGTGACGTCAGTGGGC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham International) and extracted once with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:25:1, v/v). Binding reactions contained 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2% deoxycholic acid, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol, 2 μg of polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid, 0.1 ng of DNA (14,000 cpm), and 4 μl of nuclear protein extract (20 μg). Samples supplemented with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide were used as negative controls. Each 20-μl reaction was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were separated on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × Tris borate/EDTA. Band intensities were quantified by densitometric scanning.Nitrite DeterminationTo RINm5F cells (50-70% confluency) was added 10 μMN-acetylsphingosine, 5 μM sodium orthovanadate, 100 nM okadaic acid, or 25 units/ml IL-1β as described in the figure legends. Six hours later, duplicate samples (2 × 80 μl) were taken for nitrite determination as described previously(7.Welsh N. Eizirik D.L. Bendtzen K. Sandler S. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3167-3173Google Scholar, 25.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Google Scholar).StatisticsData are expressed as means ± S.E., and groups were compared using Student's paired t test.RESULTSEffects of IL-1β on Lipid Content of RINm5F CellsSince diacylglycerol kinase phosphorylates both diacylglycerol and ceramide using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate, both lipids can be quantified in the same reaction. It was found that the DAG content of RINm5F cells was higher than the ceramide content (Fig. 1). IL-1β induced a significant increase in the ceramide content after both 2 and 5 min of exposure (Fig. 1). After 20 min, this effect could no longer be observed (Fig. 1). Similarly, the DAG content was increased after 5 min, but not after 20 min (Fig. 1). The increase in ceramide was paralleled by an IL-1β-induced decrease in sphingomyelin, which was 17% after 2 min, 35% after 5 min, and 28% after 20 min (Fig. 2). The ceramide 1-phosphate and phosphatidic acid contents of the RINm5F cells were not affected by IL-1β (data not shown).Figure 2:Effects of IL-1β on sphingomyelin content of RINm5F cells. RINm5F cells equilibrium-labeled with [3H]choline were exposed to 25 units/ml IL-1β for 0, 2, 5, and 20 min. Lipids were extracted and quantified as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Results are means ± S.E. for 9-11 observations. *, p < 0.05 for a chance difference versus corresponding control using Student's paired t test.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of IL-1β, Acetylsphingosine, and PMA on JNK1 Phosphorylation and JNK1 Kinase ActivityThe Santa Cruz JNK1 (N-19) antibody is reactive mainly against the 46-kDa JNK1 protein, but cross-reacts also with the 54-kDa JNK2 protein. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled RINm5F cell homogenates with this antibody demonstrated strong reactivity with both the 46- and 54-kDa phosphoproteins (Fig. 3A). Acetylsphingosine (10 μM) and PMA (100 nM) both increased the phosphorylation of the 46-kDa JNK1 protein when added during a 20-min exposure period (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of JNK1 was even more strongly enhanced by IL-1β (25 units/ml) (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylation of the 54-kDa JNK2 protein was not affected by the different test substances (Fig. 3A).Figure 3:A, effects of acetylsphingosine, PMA, and IL-1β on JNK1 phosphorylation. RINm5F cells were 32P-labeled for 2 h and then exposed to 10 μM acetylsphingosine (lane 2), 100 nM PMA (lane 3), and 25 units/ml IL-1β (lane 4) for 20 min. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The position of JNK1 (46 kDa) is indicated by the lower arrow. The upper arrow indicates the position of the 54-kDa JNK2 phosphoprotein. This figure is representative of three separate experiments. B, effects of acetylsphingosine, PMA, and IL-1β on JNK1 in vitro kinase activity. RINm5F cells were exposed for 20 min to 10 μM acetylsphingosine (lane 2), 100 nM PMA (lane 3), 10 μM acetylsphingosine + 10 nM PMA (lane 4), and 25 units/ml IL-1β (lane 5). Lane 1 in A and B is the control. Homogenates were then immunoprecipitated for JNK1, and the in vitro kinase activity was determined using GST-c-Jun fusion protein as substrate. The position of phosphorylated GST-c-Jun is indicated by the arrow. C, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of cell homogenates separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lanes are the same as described for B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The in vitro kinase activity of JNK1, measured as phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun fusion protein, was weakly increased by 10 μM acetylsphingosine (37 ± 12%, n = 3) and by 100 nM PMA (95 ± 35%, n = 3). The combination of acetylsphingosine and PMA increased GST-c-Jun phosphorylation by 63 ± 12%, and IL-1β (25 units/ml) increased GST-c-Jun phosphorylation by 275 ± 70% (n = 3) (Fig. 3B). There was no phosphorylation of a 38-kDa protein when only GST was used as a phosphorylation substrate (data not shown). Fig. 3C demonstrates that equal amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation and JNK1 activity determination.Effects of IL-1β, Acetylsphingosine, and PMA on Transcription Factor ATF2 Migration on SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel ElectrophoresisIn control RINm5F cells, strong reactivity with a 69-kDa band was observed when performing immunoblot analysis for ATF2 (Fig. 4A). Addition of IL-1β induced the appearance of an additional higher molecular mass band (72 kDa) immunoreactive with the anti-ATF2 antibody (Fig. 4A). The induction of the 72-kDa band by IL-1β was mimicked by 100 nM PMA and, to a lesser extent, by 1 and 10 μM acetylsphingosine (Fig. 4A). There was no effect of 0.1 μM acetylsphingosine (Fig. 4A). Induction of the 72-kDa band was apparent after 10 min and persisted for at least 60 min (data not shown). The 72-kDa band, present in IL-1β-treated RINm5F cells and not in control cells, could not be observed after treatment of the homogenate with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the 72-kDa band is the phosphorylated form of ATF2.Figure 4:A, immunoblot analysis of ATF2 in RINm5F cells exposed to acetylsphingosine, PMA, and IL-1β. RINm5F cells were exposed for 20 min to 0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10 μM acetylsphingosine (lanes 1-4, respectively), 100 nM PMA (lane 5), and 25 units/ml IL-1β (lane 6). The lower arrow indicates the position of the 69-kDa ATF2 form, and upper arrow indicates the position of the phosphorylated 72-kDa ATF2 form. Positions of molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) are given on the right. The figure is representative of three separate experiments. B, immunoblot analysis of ATF2. Homogenates from control RINm5F cells (lanes 1 and 2) or IL-1β-exposed RINm5F cells (lanes 3 and 4) were either untreated (lanes 1 and 3) or incubated with alkaline phosphatase (lanes 2 and 4). The upper arrow shows the position of phosphorylated ATF2, and the lower arrow show that of nonphosphorylated ATF2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of IL-1β, Ceramide, and DAG on Transcription Factor DNA Binding ActivitiesA 20-min exposure of RINm5F cells to IL-1β (25 units/ml) induced a 15-fold increase in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). This effect was not mimicked by acetylsphingosine (1 and 10 μM) or PMA (100 nM); there was only a nonsignificant trend toward higher DNA binding activities with these agents (p > 0.05). The three agents, IL-1β, acetylsphingosine, and PMA, all tended to moderately increase (50-70%) the DNA binding activities of AP-1 and C/EBP. Using Student's paired t test, 1 μM acetylsphingosine increased significantly the activities of AP-1 and C/EBP (p < 0.05), 100 nM PMA stimulated the activity of C/EBP (p < 0.05), and IL-1β enhanced the activity of C/EBP (p < 0.01). Acetylsphingosine, PMA, and IL-1β all stimulated similarly (4-5-fold; p < 0.05) the DNA binding activity of the ATF transcription factors (Figure 5:, Figure 6:). The effect of acetylsphingosine was maximal already at 1 μM (Figure 5:, Figure 6:).Effects of IL-1β, Okadaic Acid, Sodium Orthovanadate, and Acetylsphingosine on RINm5F Nitrite ProductionThe phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and sodium orthovanadate have previously been shown to enhance IL-1β-induced nitrite production(14.Welsh N. Biosci. Rep. 1994; 14: 43-50Google Scholar). In this study, N-acetylsphingosine, okadaic acid, and vanadate were unable to induce nitrite formation, either alone or in combination (Fig. 7). IL-1β induced by itself a marked response (Fig. 7), which was not further enhanced by N-acetylsphingosine (data not shown). N-Acetylsphingosine (10 μM) also did not induce nitrite production from isolated rat islets when added during a 24-h culture period (data not shown).Figure 6:Effects of acetylsphingosine, PMA, and IL-1β on transcription factor activation.

This is in line with previous studies demonstrating IL-1 activation of a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C in Jurkat T cells, which generates DAG but not inositol trisphosphate, and showing that DAG was generated in isolated mouse pancreatic islets in response to IL-1β without any concomitant increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations(26.Rosoff P.M. Savage N. Dinarello C.A. Cell. 1988; 54: 73-81Google Scholar, 27.Eizirik D.L. Sandler S. Welsh N. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 111: 159-165Google Scholar). The presently observed decrease in sphingomyelin and a concomitant increase in ceramide imply the activation of a sphingomyelinase by IL-1β in RINm5F cells. It is unclear whether the sphingomyelinase is stimulated directly by the activated IL-1 receptor or whether sphingomyelinase activation is indirectly accomplished by the increased DAG level. Indeed, DAG is known to trigger sphingomyelinase activity in Jurkat T cells and in GH3 rat pituitary cells(28.Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M.

The present finding that acetylsphingosine and PMA could not be clearly differentiated with respect to their activation profiles of JNK1 and the transcription factors may be explained by DAG- or PMA-induced sphingomyelinase activation and the concomitant gener"

The latter polypeptide has been shown to interact with the HIV-1 proteins Rev and Tat and with the splicing factor 2 (SF2). Using recombinant proteins produced in bacteria and synthetic peptides representing different regions of LBR, we now show that the LBR kinase modifies specifically arginine-serine (RS) dipeptide motifs located at the nucleoplasmic, NH2-terminal domain of LBR and in members of the SR family of splicing factors. Furthermore, we show that the NH2-terminal domain of LBR binds to p34/p32, whereas a mutated domain lacking the RS region does not. Phosphorylation of LBR by the RS kinase completely abolishes binding of p34/p32, suggesting that this enzyme regulates interactions among the components of the LBR complex.

Several integral proteins of the inner nuclear membrane have been characterized recently (for recent reviews, see Gerace and Foisner (1994) and Georgatos et al.(1994)). One such protein, originally identified in nucleated avian erythrocytes is the #x0201C;lamin B receptor” (LBR) or #x0201C;p58.” cDNA sequencing of chicken and human LBR has revealed that the protein possesses a long, hydrophilic NH2-terminal domain protruding into the nucleoplasm, eight hyrdophobic segments which are predicted to span the membrane, and a hydrophilic COOH-terminal domain (Worman et al., 1990; Ye and Worman, 1994). The NH2-terminal domain of LBR contains distinct sites for protein kinase A and Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation (Simos and Georgatos, 1992; Courvalin et al., 1992), as well as a stretch rich in arginine-serine (RS) motifs (Simos and Georgatos, 1994). Such dipeptide motifs have been identified in a variety of splicing factors and have been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions between components of the splicing machinery (Wu and Maniatis, 1993; Kohtz et al., 1994). LBR is widely expressed in cells of higher eukaryotes, and the human gene has been recently characterized (Schuler et al., 1994). In addition, three yeast proteins have been identified that are homologous to the hydrophobic regions and the COOH-terminal domain of LBR, but lack most of the NH2-terminal domain (Chen et al., 1991; Lorenz and Parks, 1992; Shimanuki et al., 1992). One of these LBR-related polypeptides (ERG24) is involved in sterol metabolism, and its function in yeast is not complemented by higher eukaryotic LBR (Smith and Blobel, 1994). On the basis of this evidence, it has been previously proposed that #x0201C;full-length” and #x0201C;NH2-truncated” forms of LBR may represent distinct members of a multigene family which includes nuclear envelope and ER ( 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferase.) proteins (Georgatos et al., 1994). endoplasmic reticulum human immunodeficiency virus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathione S-transferase. LBR associates with B-type lamins both in vitro and in vivo (Worman et al., 1988; Simos and Georgatos, 1992; Ye and Worman, 1994; Smith and Blobel, 1994), consistent with its presumed function as a lamin receptor. Although the NH2-terminal domain of LBR is probably responsible for lamin B binding (Ye and Worman, 1994), interactions between the farnesyl group of lamin B and the transmembrane regions of LBR also seem likely (Georgatos et al., 1994; Smith and Blobel, 1994). The association of B-type lamins with LBR is not disrupted during mitosis, when the nuclear envelope is fragmented and the nuclear lamina depolymerized (Meier and Georgatos, 1994). Recent work has shown that during interphase LBR forms a multimeric complex which includes the nuclear lamins A and B, a specific LBR kinase, and three other polypeptides with molecular masses of 18 (p18), 34 (p34), and 150 (p150) kDa, respectively (Simos and Georgatos, 1992). p18 has been characterized recently as a new integral membrane protein of the bird erythrocyte nuclear envelope. ( 2G. Simos, C. Maison, and S. D. Georgatos, unpublished observations.) Furthermore, p34 has been identified as the avian equivalent of a human nuclear protein known as p32 (Simos and Georgatos, 1994). p32 has been characterized previously and found to co-isolate with splicing factor 2 (SF2) (Krainer et al., 1991). Recently, Luo et al.(1994) have shown that p32 also interacts with the viral trans-activator Rev, which is required for the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Another interaction of p32 seems to involve the HIV-1 protein Tat (Fridell et al., 1995). The LBR kinase was previously shown to cofractionate with LBR and to phosphorylate LBR in vivo and in vitro, exclusively at serine residues. The enzyme is clearly distinct from protein kinase A and Cdc2 kinase, for both of which LBR is a substrate (Simos and Georgatos, 1992). Reasoning that the LBR kinase may regulate interactions between LBR and its partners, we decided to characterize this activity in detail. Results presented below show that the LBR kinase belongs to a novel class of protein kinases which modify specifically RS motifs (Woppmann et al., 1993; Gui et al., 1994). The LBR kinase regulates, through phosphorylation of the RS region, the binding of p34/p32 to the NH2-terminal domain of LBR. Affi-Gel 10, Protein A-Sepharose, and phosphocellulose were purchased from Bio-Rad, Pharmacia (Pharmacia Uppsala, Sweden), and Whatman (Whatman BioSystems Ltd., United Kingdom), respectively. Histones were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Germany). [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham (Amersham, Bacacos SA, Greece). A preparation of RS splicing factors, and the peptide RSF (RSRSRSRSRSRS) corresponding to the RS domain of splicing factors, were kindly provided by C. Calvio and A. Lamond (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). Peptides R1 (61KQRKSQSSSSSPSRRSRSRS80), R2 (78SRSRSRSPGRPAKG91), R0 (70SSPSRRSRSRSRSRSPGRPAKG91), R3 (90KGRRRSSSHSRE101), R4 (182KIFEAIKTPEKPSSKT197), R5 (*C497ANSQKNNFRRNPADPK511), R6 (*C119KPSENNTRRYNGEPDSTERND139), R7 (*C135TERNDTSSKLLEQQKLKPDVE155), and R8 (580DEHHCKKKYGLAWERY595*C), representing different regions of chicken LBR (Worman et al., 1990), were made at the Protein Sequencing and Peptide Synthesis Facility of EMBL. A cysteine residue (*C) was added to the sequences for coupling purposes. R0 peptide was coupled to Affi-Gel 10 by incubating 30 mg of the peptide with 3 ml of the column as described previously (Georgatos and Blobel, 1987b). The anti-LBR antibody aR1, raised against the peptide R1, as well as an anti-p34 antibody (ap34-C), raised against the COOH-terminal residues (CGG141TGESEWKDTNYTLNTDS157) of HeLa p32 (Honore et al., 1993), were prepared and affinity-purified as described previously (Simos and Georgatos, 1992, 1994). The tripeptide CGG was added to the sequences for coupling purposes. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes and plasma membranes were isolated as described previously (Georgatos and Blobel, 1987a, 1987b). Nuclear content was isolated by extensive digestion of nuclei with DNase I. LBR was purified by electroelution from urea-insoluble nuclear envelope fractions. For these purposes, SDS-polyacrylamide gels were initially stained with copper sulfate, and the appropriate bands were excised. After washing in 0.25 M EDTA, 0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, to remove copper ions, LBR was recovered in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.025% SDS using the Biotrap BT 1000 apparatus (Schleicher & Schuell GmbH, Germany). p34 was purified by applying the Triton X-100 extract of turkey erythrocyte ghosts to an immunoaffinity column containing 1 mg of affinity-purified aR1 IgG bound to Protein A-Sepharose. p34 was eluted by 1 M NaCl and was further purified by passing the 1 M NaCl eluate of the immunoaffinity column through a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (Simos and Georgatos, 1994). To isolate the LBR kinase, turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes were extracted either with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 1 mM PMSF, or with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF, and 1% Triton X-114. The aqueous phase of the Triton X-114 extract (Bordier, 1981) or the 1 M NaCl extract (following dilution to 0.3 M and clarification by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min) were applied to a phosphocellulose column previously equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 M NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM PMSF. The bound proteins were eluted by a linear (0.3-1 M) NaCl gradient. Kinase-containing fractions were pooled, the salt concentration was adjusted to 0.35 M, and the material was further chromatographed through an Affi-Gel 10 column containing the R0 peptide. Analysis of the flow-through fractions showed that all the kinase activity was bound to the column. The column was subsequently washed with 0.9 M NaCl, and elution of the kinase activity was accomplished by a linear (0.9-2.2 M) NaCl gradient. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated with an Amicon device, and used in subsequent experiments. RS kinase activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of PO3-4 from [γ-32P]ATP to electroeluted LBR. Routine assays were carried out at 30°C in a total volume of 25 μl containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol), 0.3% Triton X-100, 1.5 μg of LBR, and an aliquot of the enzyme. After 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 5 × electrophoresis sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli(1970) using 12% polyacrylamide gels. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford(1976). For the determination of Km, the amount of substrate in the reaction mixture was varied between 0.1 and 5 μg, and incorporation of radioactivity was measured by excising the radioactive bands from an SDS-PAGE gel and scintillation counting. The Km values were calculated using the MicroCal Origin (version 2.94) program. For determination of stoichiometry, phosphorylation was carried out using a concentration of substrate at the end of the linear range of the reaction, and the incorporation of radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting of excised radioactive bands from an SDS-PAGE gel. In situ kinase assays were performed according to Kameshita and Fujisawa(1989). LBR was added to the separating gel, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, prior to polymerization. For control experiments, LBR was omitted or replaced with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Electrophoresis was carried out at 25 mA for approximately 1 h, using 12% acrylamide minigels. SDS was removed from the gel by equilibration in 20% 2-propanol, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The kinase was then fully denatured by incubating in 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride for 1 h at room temperature and allowed to renature overnight at 4°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% Tween 40, pH 8.0. Gels were incubated in 4 ml of assay buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl) for 20 min, at room temperature. The kinase assay was then initiated by the addition of 50 μM cold ATP and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol). Incubation was carried out for an additional 60 min. The reaction was terminated by extensive washing with 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. Proteolytic peptide mapping was performed essentially as described by Luo et al.(1991). Briefly, phosphorylated LBR was run on a SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet. The radioactive LBR bands were excised, soaked in 0.5% PVP 360 (polyvinylpyrrolidone) in 100 mM acetic acid, for 1 h, at 37°C and washed extensively with water. Samples were then digested to completion with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin in 50 mM NH4HCO3, at 37°C, overnight. Residual salt was removed by repeated lyophilization, and the digests were subsequently applied to thin layer cellulose plates (Kodak) for two-dimensional peptide mapping. Electrophoresis (in the first dimension) was run at pH 8.9 (1% ammonium carbonate) for 1 h at 500 V. Ascending chromatography (in the second dimension) was performed using as a solvent a mixture of 1-butanol:pyridine:acetic acid:water in ratios of 750:500:150:600. The pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used to construct plasmids that encode various regions of chicken LBR (Worman et al., 1990) fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Smith and Johnson, 1988). To generate the cDNA coding for wtNt, 30 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction were performed as described by Saiki et al.(1987), using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT). Full-length LBR cloned to the EcoRI site of Bluescript SK- was used as template. The LBR-SK- clone was a generous gift of G. Blobel (Rockefeller University, New York) and H. J. Worman (Columbia University, New York). Parameters for polymerase chain reaction were as follows: denaturation at 92°C for 1 min, annealing at 57°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 40 s. The sense primer contained nucleotides +1 to +21 of LBR preceded by a BamHI site. CAGTA was added 5′ to the BamHI site. The antisense primer was complementary to nucleotides +598 to +615 of LBR. 5′ to this sequence was a complementary stop codon preceded by an EcoRI site. GC was added 5′ to the EcoRI site. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified using the QIAEX Gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.). Purified DNA was digested with EcoRI and BamHI, repurified, and ligated into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-2T. Escherichia coli strains XL-1 Blue were transformed by standard methods. An oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis system (Altered SitesRII, In Vitro Mutagenesis System, Promega) was used to delete five serine and arginine repeats in the NH2-terminal domain of LBR. Using the oligonucleotide 5′-TGCTGGCCGACCAGGTCTGGAAGAGAACT-3′, the codons for amino acids 75 to 84 were deleted (ΔRSwtNt). In addition, using the oligonucleotides 5′-TCTGCTTCTACCTCTTCTGGA-3′, 5′-TCGAGATCTGCCTCTACTTCT-3′, 5′-TCTGGATCGAGCTCTGCTTCT-3′, 5′-AGGAGATCTGGCTCGAGATCT-3′, and 5′-GACCAGGAGCTCTGGATCG-3′, Ser76, Ser78, Ser80, Ser82, and Ser84 were mutated to Gly (GST-NtG76), Gly (GST-NtG78), Ala (GST-NtA80), Ala (GST-NtA82), and Ala (GST-NtA84), respectively. The mutated cDNAs were sequenced and subcloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector as described previously for wtNt. A fragment containing all five arginine-serine repeats was generated using the following two complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCAGAAGTAGAAGCAGATCTCGATCCAGATCTAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTAGATCTGGATCGAGATCTGCTTCTACTTCTG-3′ and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI site of pGEX-2T expression vector. GST fusion proteins were produced in bacteria and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia), as described by Smith and Johnson (1988). When used in phosphorylation experiments, the fusion proteins were dialyzed previously against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The standard binding assays involved 3 μg of GST-wtNt or GST-ΔRSwtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and ∽1 μg of partially purified p34, resuspended in PBST (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mM PMSF) in a total volume of 1 ml. In other experiments, purified p34 was replaced by a Triton X-100 extract of turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes. The mixtures were incubated for 60 min at room temperature and then centrifuged for 3 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The beads were resuspended in 25 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and bound material was analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Phosphorylation of GST-wtNt was achieved by incubating glutathione-Sepharose beads with purified LBR kinase in the presence of 100 μM ATP. After 30 min, the beads were pelleted, washed with PBST, and used for the binding assays, as described. Blots were processed as described by Harlow and Lane(1988), using the ap34-C antibody. For detection of immunoreactive proteins, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies were used. We have reported previously that turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes contain substantial levels of LBR kinase activity and that the envelope-bound enzyme can be partially solubilized by extraction with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (Simos and Georgatos, 1992). To examine more systematically the distribution of the LBR kinase and obtain a preparation enriched in this activity, we fractionated turkey erythrocytes using established methods (Georgatos and Blobel, 1987a, 1987b). The different subcellular fractions were assayed for kinase activity employing as a substrate exogenous LBR that had been purified by electroelution. Cytosolic and plasma membrane fractions together contained approximately 20% of the total LBR kinase activity, while 80% of this was recovered in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1). High levels of the enzyme were present in the nuclear content, released from the nuclei after treatment with DNase I, as well as in the 1 M NaCl extract of the nuclear envelopes. However, the salt-washed nuclear envelopes retained a significant portion of the kinase and represented the fraction with the highest specific activity. Taking this information into account, we chose as a source for the kinase the whole nuclear envelope fraction which contained about 50% of the total LBR kinase activity. To selectively extract the LBR kinase we used two methods. First, we treated nuclear envelopes at 4°C with the detergent Triton X-114 and then induced phase separation by raising the temperature of the extracted material to 37°C. Under these conditions, the bulk of solubilized LBR partitioned with the detergent phase, whereas a significant portion of the kinase activity was released in the aqueous phase (Fig. 2A). Alternatively, we treated the nuclear envelopes with 1 M NaCl which extracted considerable amounts of the enzyme, but did not release significant amounts of LBR or other integral membrane proteins (Fig. 2B). The detergent extract of nuclear envelopes was practically devoid of histone kinase activity and contained low levels of casein kinase; however, the salt extract of nuclear envelopes contained significant amounts of both histone and casein kinase activity (Fig. 2, A and B, and data not shown). As a first step to characterize the enzyme we were interested in, we used salt or Triton X-114 extracts which contained LBR-free kinase to phosphorylate a set of peptides representing different regions of the NH2- and the COOH-terminal domains of LBR (Fig. 3B, for details see #x0201C;Materials and Methods”). Two NH2-terminal peptides (R2 and R0) which contained three or five arginine-serine (RS) motifs, respectively, could be phosphorylated by the LBR kinase (Fig. 3A). However, a third NH2-terminal peptide (R1) which contained three RS motifs but no downstream flanking sequence could not serve as a substrate and affected LBR phosphorylation marginally (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the synthetic derivative R0 (which contained the highest number of RS motifs) inhibited completely the phosphorylation of purified LBR by the corresponding kinase, while the other two peptides inhibited LBR phosphorylation to a lower extent (Fig. 3A). These data strongly suggested that the RS dipeptide motifs represent the major phosphorylation sites of LBR modified by the LBR kinase. To explore this point further, we expressed in E. coli a fusion protein consisting of GST and the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (residues 1-205; construct termed GST-wtNt). For control purposes, we also expressed in bacteria a similar fusion protein missing the RS motifs (deletion of residues 75-84; construct termed GST-ΔRSNt), as well as a protein consisting of GST and the RS region of LBR (residues 75-84; construct termed GST-RS). The three recombinant proteins were used as substrates for in vitro phosphorylation assays. Data depicted in Fig. 4 reveal that LBR kinase present in salt or Triton X-114 extracts could efficiently phosphorylate GST-wtNt, whereas GST-ΔRSNt was not phosphorylated. This was not due to a global misfolding of the polypeptide chain induced by the deletion of the RS region, because both GST-ΔRSNt and GST-wtNt (both of which contain a consensus protein kinase A site) were efficiently modified by protein kinase A and exhibited the same solubility and ligand-binding properties. ( 3E. Nikolakaki, J. Meier, G. Simos, and S. D. Georgatos, unpublished observations.) Finally, GST-RS could serve as a substrate for the LBR kinase, but was phosphorylated at a lower stoichiometry than GST-wtNt. The relatively lower extent of phosphorylation in the latter case might be due to the lack of #x0201C;context” information normally provided by sequences flanking the RS region. This idea is further supported by the fact that the synthetic peptide R0, which includes the RS region but lacks long neighboring sequences, was also phosphorylated substoichiometrically in comparison to intact LBR or GST-wtNt (data not shown). Exploiting this information, we proceeded with the purification of the LBR kinase from nuclear envelope extracts. To this end, we first chromatographed the salt extract or the aqueous phase of the Triton X-114 extract through phosphocellulose and loaded the pool of the fractions possessing LBR kinase activity onto an agarose column containing immobilized R0 peptide (for details see #x0201C;Materials and Methods”). Analysis of the eluted fractions by SDS-PAGE and staining of the corresponding gels with silver nitrate revealed the presence of two bands, a major one at 54 kDa and a minor one at 110 kDa (Fig. 5A). In situ phosphorylation assays in polyacrylamide gels to which 0.1 mg/ml purified LBR were incorporated revealed that a protein with a molecular mass of 110 kDa could modify LBR (Fig. 5B, lane 2). This was specific because no labeling was detected when LBR was omitted from the gel or replaced by bovine serum albumin (data not shown). In addition, the same 110-kDa polypeptide appeared to phosphorylate LBR when, instead of the column-purified preparation, LBR kinase co-immunoprecipitated with LBR from a Triton X-100 lysate of nuclear envelopes was used in the in situ gel assay (Fig. 5B, lane 1). These data suggest that the 110-kDa band corresponds to the catalytic subunit of the LBR kinase. The nature of the 54-kDa protein which copurifies with the kinase but contains no LBR-phosphorylating activity is presently unknown. The column-purified enzyme was also able to bind to LBR in solution and could be co-immunoprecipitated with LBR using affinity-purified antibodies (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). Binding involved the RS dipeptide motifs of the LBR, since the kinase was able to associate with the GST-wtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, whereas no interaction with GST-ΔRSNt was observed (Fig. 5C, lanes 3-5). The partially purified LBR kinase did not modify histones, casein, and myelin basic protein, but did phosphorylate intact LBR and GST-wtNt (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, when a well-characterized subcellular fraction containing SR proteins (Zhaler et al., 1992) was incubated with column-purified kinase, we found that the enzyme could efficiently phosphorylate the 30-kDa major component (Fig. 6B). The other proteins present in the SR fraction were not phosphorylated to a significant extent suggesting that the LBR kinase may show substrate selectivity. The 30-kDa band contains two distinct polypeptides SRp30a and SRp30b, which have also been described as SF2 and SC35, respectively. The phosphorylation of LBR and SRp30 was inhibited by an excess of the synthetic peptide R0 as well as by a peptide containing six arginine-serine (RS) repeats (RSF, Fig. 6C). From the sum of these observations it can be inferred that the LBR kinase belongs to a novel class of enzymes which can also modify SR proteins (Gui et al. 1994). To determine more specifically the serine residues of LBR that are phosphorylated by the LBR kinase, we expressed in E. coli fusion proteins identical with GST-wtNt except that in each case one of Ser76, Ser78, Ser80, Ser82, and Ser84 of the RS motif was mutated to glycine or alanine (Table 1). Mutation of Ser76 to Gly resulted in a construct that could not be expressed in E. coli, even though the sequence and the proper subcloning of the mutated cDNA into the pGEX-2T expression vector were confirmed. However, the other four recombinant proteins were appropriately expressed, purified, and used as substrates for in vitro phosphorylation assays with the partially purified LBR kinase. Results presented in Table 1 and Fig. 7 reveal that all four fusion proteins could be phosphorylated similarly to wtNt. The apparent Km of the kinase for the recombinant proteins was in the range of 1.7-2.4 μM. Taking into consideration that the stoichiometry of the phosphorylation reaction for both wtNt and the mutants was close to 1, any one of the serines of the RS motif, but only one per molecule, should be phosphorylated at steady state. That several spots have been observed previously in two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of in vivo or in vitro phosphorylated LBR (for relevant information, see Simos and Georgatos(1992)) is consistent with this interpretation. Similar phosphopeptide mapping confirm that the peptides phosphorylated by the partially purified LBR kinase correspond to the peptides phosphorylated in vivo. ( 4E. Nikolakaki, G. Simos, S. D. Georgatos, and T. Giannakouros, unpublished observations.) Tabled 1Figure 7:Inhibition of LBR phosphorylation by GST-wtNt and serine mutants of GST-Nt (for nomenclature see text and Table 1). One μg of purified LBR was incubated with radiolabeled ATP and the LBR kinase in the presence of buffer(-), GST-wtNt, GST-ΔRSNt, or mutated forms of GST-Nt (10 μg), as indicated. The reaction products were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and autoradiographed. Note that LBR phosphorylation is competed off by GST-wtNt and all serine mutants, but not by GST-ΔRS. Also notice that GST-Nt and the serine mutants are all phosphorylated by the enzyme, whereas GST-ΔRS is not.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that p34/p32 is co-immunoprecipitated with LBR when Triton X-100 extracts of whole erythrocytes or erythrocyte ghosts are incubated with affinity-purified anti-LBR antibodies (Simos and Georgatos, 1992, 1994). To find out whether the p34/p32-LBR interaction involves the RS motifs of the latter, GST-wtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with a fraction highly enriched in p34/p32 (for details on purification, see #x0201C;Materials and Methods”). Fig. 8A shows that p34/p32 and GST-wtNt formed a binary complex. This complex could be detected by probing blots of the material co-sedimenting with GST-wtNt-glutathione-Sepharose beads with affinity-purified anti-p34/p32 antibodies (Simos and Georgatos, 1994). Similar results were obtained when GST-wtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, or electroeluted LBR bound to anti-LBR antibodies/Protein A-Sepharose beads, were incubated with a Triton X-100 extract of turkey erythrocyte nuclear envelopes, and the material bound to the beads was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 8B, lane 1, and data not shown). The specificity of this binding was assessed by performing the same type of experiment with the deletion mutant GST-ΔRSNt. Under these conditions, the binding of p34/p32 to the glutathione beads carrying the mutant protein was greatly inhibited (Fig. 8A, lane 4) or completely abolished (Fig. 8B, lane 3). Finally, repetition of the assay in the presence of an excess of R0 peptide also abolished binding between GST-wtNt and p34/p32 (Fig. 8B, lane 2). From these results it can be concluded that p34/p32 binds to LBR by interacting with the RS-containing region. Knowing that p34/p32 and LBR interact through the RS motifs and considering that these motifs are specifically modified by the LBR kinase, we set to examine whether binding of p34/p32 to LBR is affected by RS phosphorylation. For this purpose, GST-wtNt immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated either with buffer and ATP or with purified LBR kinase and ATP (see above) to allow phosphorylation to occur. Afterwards, the beads were further incubated with a detergent extract of nuclear envelopes containing p34/p32. Examination of the material that co-sedimented with the beads by immunoblotting showed that p34/p32 does not bind to phosphorylated GST-wtNt (Fig. 9, lane 3), but does bind to unphosphorylated GST-wtNt (Fig. 9, lane 1). To distinguish whether the binding is indeed inhibited by phosphorylation, or whether the kinase and p34/p32 compete for the same binding site on LBR, we repeated the same type of experiment in the presence of the LBR kinase but adding or omitting ATP in the course of the assay. Fig. 9, lane 4, shows that binding of p34/p32 to the fusion protein was inhibited only when ATP was present in the reaction mixture. Thus, binding of p34/p32 to LBR seems to be inhibited after phosphorylation of the RS motifs. We report here the characterization of the LBR-associated kinase. The partially purified enzyme is able to bind to the NH2-terminal domain of LBR, phosphorylating the same sites as those modified in vivo (Simos and Georgatos, 1992). Using synthetic peptides representing different regions of LBR and recombinant proteins produced in bacteria, we have shown that LBR kinase modifies specifically arginine-serine (RS) dipeptide motifs occurring in LBR and in splicing factors. Our results suggest that any one of the serine residues in the RS region of LBR can serve as a phosphorylation site for the LBR kinase. The family of SR proteins includes essential splicing factors that commit precursor mRNA to splicing and mediate spliceosome assembly (Fu, 1993). Although their role in the splicing mechanism is not yet clear, mutational studies have shown that the RS domains in U2AF65 and in ASF/SF2 are required for splicing activity (Zamore et al., 1992; Caceres and Krainer, 1993; Zuo and Manley, 1993). Recent data suggest that phosphorylation promotes spliceosome assembly but blocks the catalytic steps of splicing, and the prime candidates for the targets of phosphorylation are the RS domain-containing splicing factors (Mermoud et al., 1994; Gui et al., 1994). There have been two reports on protein kinases which phosphorylate specifically RS motifs (Woppmann et al., 1993; Gui et al., 1994). One such activity is associated with snRNP particles and phosphorylates the U1 snRNP 70-kDa protein at a subset of the sites phosphorylated in vivo (Woppmann et al., 1993). This activity also phosphorylates the COOH-terminal, RS-rich domain of ASF/SF2. In addition, Gui et al.(1994) identified a cell cycle-regulated serine kinase (SRPK1 = SR Protein Kinase 1), with an apparent molecular mass of 92 kDa, which can phosphorylate splicing factors of the RS family. Purified SRPK1 can induce disassembly of speckled intranuclear snRNP structures in interphase nuclei. The exact location of the kinase in the nucleus is not known. At present, we do not know if the LBR kinase is the same with the enzyme purified by Gui et al.(1994). SDS-PAGE analysis together with in situ gel assays predict a molecular mass of 110 kDa for the catalytic subunit of the LBR kinase, which is significantly higher than that of SRPK1. This observation indicates that the two kinases are distinct; however, species-specific differences between birds and mammals may also be the reason for this difference in apparent Mr. Previous studies have shown that one of the polypeptides participating in the multimeric LBR complex is p34 (Simos and Georgatos, 1994), a homologue of a previously identified protein (p32) associated with splicing factor 2 (Krainer et al., 1991). This protein does not have a splicing activity itself and does not affect the splicing activity of SF2 (Krainer et al., 1991). However, the fact that p32 and SF2 co-purify through several chromatographic steps suggests a specific and probably functional interaction between the two proteins. As p32/p34 interacts with the HIV-1 products Rev and Tat (Luo et al., 1994; Fridell et al., 1995), it is also possible that p32/p34 may affect the properties of viral transcriptional and splicing regulators. Because p34 does not co-isolate with LBR when extraction and purification are performed under conditions that favor phosphorylation (e.g. in the presence of ATP and phosphatase inhibitors; Simos and Georgatos(1992, 1994)), we suspected that p34 may interact with the RS domain of LBR in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Results obtained by in vitro binding assays clearly show that p34 binds tightly to the RS motifs of LBR when the latter is unphosphorylated, but dissociates from it upon phosphorylation mediated by the LBR kinase. Recent studies have shown that the RS domains mediate protein-protein interactions between components of the splicing machinery (Wu and Maniatis, 1993; Kohtz et al., 1994), probably in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Woppmann et al., 1993; Mermoud et al., 1994). The existence of RS motifs in the LBR molecule and the occurrence of a splicing factor-associated protein among the constituents of the LBR complex raise the possibility that LBR, alone or in combination with p34, may interact with components of the splicing machinery. Taking into account earlier observations (Spector et al., 1991), it can be speculated that LBR and its partners act as transient docking sites for nuclear #x0201C;speckles,” in the nuclear envelope. Such a possibility is further supported by the fact that snRNPs migrate to the nuclear periphery when murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL) are induced to differentiate in vitro (Antoniou et al., 1993). Based on the fact that the lamins are peripheral membrane proteins, whereas LBR traverses the inner nuclear membrane, LBR was considered to function as a lamin receptor. On the other hand, LBR, together with the integral membrane protein LAP2 (Foisner and Gerace, 1993), are the most obvious candidates to mediate the association of interphase nuclear membranes to chromatin (Maison et al., 1995). ( 5J. Meier, G. Simos, E. Nikolakaki, T. Giannakouros, and S. D. Georgatos, unpublished observations.) The data presented here expand the possible functions of LBR, raising the possibility that the LBR complex is a molecular device that may couple the karyoskeleton (nuclear lamina) to regulatory factors involved in different aspects of gene expression. It is also noteworthy that protein kinase A and Cdc2, which can be induced by hormones and mitotic factors, modify sites which are close, but distinct, from those phosphorylated by the RS kinase. Given that this segment of the molecule is exposed to the nucleoplasm and is charged (Worman et al., 1990), these modifications may as well participate in the regulation of LBR-protein and/or LBR-DNA interactions during interphase or mitosis. Such potential interactions remain to be addressed in future studies. We thank C. Calvio and A. Lamond for providing us with a preparation of SR splicing factors and peptide RSF and G. Blobel and H. J. Worman for the LBR cDNA clone. We would also like to thank J. G. Georgatsos, I. Mattai, J. Woodgett, I. Hoffman, and J. Meier for useful discussions and comments on the manuscript."

INTRODUCTIONMany biological actions such as ligand-receptor interactions are based on the specificity of proteins conferred by the primary sequence of amino acids as well as the secondary and tertiary structures dictated by the primary sequence. Of special importance is the formation of local environments, such as active site and motif, which play a key role in the function of a protein. Among the random sequences of short peptides, there may be sequence(s) which can act on such local environments, and these sequences could serve as the lead for the development of effective new drugs. Recently various methods have been developed for identification of the sequence(s) of interest from vast mixtures of random peptide sequences or polymers (template) with various side chain groups (chemical diversity libraries) within a short period of time with minimal effort(1.Ostresh J.M.

Successful screening of these libraries has been described not only for epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies(6.Felici F. Castagnoli L. Musacchio A. Jappelli R. Cesareni G. J. Mol.

The activated PLC catalyzes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP3 induces an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), while DAG directly activates protein kinase C(14.Nishizuka Y.

On the basis of amino acid sequence similarity, the PLCs in mammalian tissue have been divided into three types (PLC-β, -γ, and -δ), each of which comprises more than one subtype(18.Rhee S.G.

A. 1993; 90: 6042-6046Google Scholar).Generally, in mature B lymphocytes, interaction of ligands with the membrane-bound immunoglobulin triggers a series of metabolic events including the rapid activation of a protein tyrosine kinase associated with the B-cell receptor(23.Clark M.R. Campbell K.S. Kazlauskas A. Johnson S.A. Hertz M. Potter T.A. Pleiman C. Cambier J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 123-126Google Scholar, 24.Cambier J.C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 257-264Google Scholar, 25.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar). The activation of these kinases leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of substrates including the phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 and PLC-γ2(26.Rhee S.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 297-301Google Scholar, 27.Sultzman L. Ellis C. Lin L.L. Pawson T. Knopf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2018-2024Google Scholar, 28.Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. DeFranco D.T. Proc.

It is assumed that the phosphorylation of PLC-γ type will lead to enzymatic activation. Therefore, the activation of protein tyrosine kinase and PLC-γ appears to be essential for ligand-mediated B-cell activation.A GTP-binding protein (G-protein) that has been postulated as a modulator of the PLC-β activity has partially been characterized at the molecular level(30.Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar, 31.Min D.S. Kim Y. Lee Y.H. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 38-42Google Scholar, 32.Jiang H. Wu D. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7593-7596Google Scholar). B cells that have been treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, herbimycin, tyrphostin) can still undergo phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis. The cells also display increases in [Ca2+]i when stimulated directly through G-proteins by AlF4-(28.Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. DeFranco D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2745-2749Google Scholar, 33.Lane P.J.L. Ledbetter J.A. McConnell F.M. Draves K.J. Deans J. Schieven G.L. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 715-722Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of the B-cell receptor abolishes subsequent tyrosine kinase activation, although the cells continue to respond to the G-protein-activating agent, mastoparan(34.Cambier J.C. Fisher C.L. Pickles H. Morrison D.C. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 13-19Google Scholar). These observations suggest that B-cell activation may involve PLC-β types or another isoform of PLC that can be mediated by G-proteins independently of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ types. PLC-β types are shown to be activated by members of the Gqα or Gβγ subunit of hetertrimeric G-protein(30.Park D. Jhon D.Y. Lee C.W. Ryu S.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3710-3714Google Scholar, 35.Blank J.L. Brattain K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23069-23075Google Scholar). However, the implication of G-protein in B-cell activation remains to be characterized.In this study, we have identified peptides which stimulate the formation of InoPs in cells from libraries of hexapeptides. The peptides appear to have positive effects on the formation of InoPs and [Ca2+]i release in certain cell types such as U266 (human B myeloma), HL 60 (human promyelocytic lymphoma), and U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma). These effects appear to be mediated through the binding of the peptide to cell-surface receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFmoc amino acids were obtained from Millipore Co (Bedford, MA). Rapidamide resin was purchased from DuPont (Boston, MA). Myo-[2-3H]inositol and the ECL kit were purchased from Amersham Corp. (Bucks, UK). Fura-2 pentaacetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) and 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA/AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). RPMI 1640 was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Dialyzed fetal bovine serum and supplemented bovine calf serum were purchased from Hyclone Laboratories Inc. (Logen, UT).Cell CultureThe U266 B myeloma cell and other cell lines were purchased from the ATCC, Rockville, MD, and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained at densities of 2 × 105 cells/ml at 37°C in a humidified incubator supplied with 95% air and 5% CO2.Preparation of Positional Scanning-Synthetic Peptide Combinatorial Libraries (PS-SPCLs)Libraries were synthesized according to the protocol of Houghten et al.(2.Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Google Scholar) and Pinilla et al.(5.Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Blanc P. Houghten R.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 162: 901-905Google Scholar). Briefly, PS-SPCLs, consisting of six-residue peptide sequences having free N termini and amidated C termini, were synthesized. A single position in each peptide mixture was individually and specifically defined with 19 of the 20 natural L-amino acids (cysteine excluded), while the five remaining positions consisted of mixtures of the same 19 amino acids. Defined positions are represented by O and the positions with mixed amino acids are represented by X. The six sets of PS-SPCLs (total 114 pools) are represented by the formula; O1XXXXX-NH2, XO2XXXX-NH2, XXO3XXX-NH2, XXXO4XX-NH2, XXXXO5X-NH2, and XXXXXO6-NH2. Libraries of peptides were constructed on Rapidamide resin beads as described elsewhere(36.Houghten R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5131-5135Google Scholar). Fmoc chemistry was used. The resin beads were distributed into different reaction vessels for each amino acid at each coupling step; pooled, washed, and thoroughly mixed for randomization; deprotected; and redistributed into the various vessels again for the next coupling step and so forth. The amount of each amino acids used to yield approximately equimolar coupling was determined empirically. The completeness of each reaction was checked with ninhydrin(37.Kaiser E.T. Colescott R.L. Blossinger C.D. Cook P.I. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 34: 595-598Google Scholar). Side chains were deprotected with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (ethanedithiol:water:thioanisole; 90:5:4:1, vol/vol). The 114 peptide mixtures were individually extracted with water, lyophilized, and dissolved in water at a final concentration of 27 nM for a peptide sequence in each pool.Synthesis of Individual PeptidesThe peptides with known sequences were synthesized on a Rapidamide resin as carrier. Briefly, peptides were assembled via standard Fmoc/t-butyl strategy on an acid-labile linker. Upon treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were cleaved and released as amides at their C-terminal position.Peptide AnalysisThe efficiency of coupling was determined by analyzing the peptide solution, before and after coupling, by reversed-phase HPLC and by reading the absorbance at 215 nm. The peptides were characterized by chromatography on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column (Vydac, 218TP1022, 22 × 300 mm). The peptides were eluted with 0-40% gradient of CH3CN in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The composition of the peptides was confirmed by amino acid analysis(38.Bidlingmeyer B. Cohen S. Tarvin T. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Google Scholar), and the peptides were sequenced by using an Applied Biosystems 473A protein/peptide microsequencer.Measurement of Inositol Phosphates Induced by PeptidesThe cells grown in culture were harvested by centrifugation, washed with inositol-free RPMI 1640 medium, and resuspended at a density of 2 × 106 cell/ml in the same medium. The cells were labeled with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/106 cell, Amersham) for 24 h at 37°C and rinsed twice with inositol-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mM LiCl, and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and resuspended at a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml. A portion (0.1 ml) of the cell suspension was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Stimulation of PIP2 hydrolysis was initiated by addition of peptides or solvents for indicated time, and the reaction terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of ice-cold 5% perchloric acid (HClO4). After 30 min in an ice bath, the tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were diluted 5-folds with distilled water and applied to Bio-Rad Dowex AG 1-X8 anion exchange columns. Each column was then washed with 2 ml of distilled water followed by 10 ml of 60 mM ammonium formate containing 5 mM sodium tetraborate. Total inositol phosphates were eluted with a solution containing 1 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid. To determine IP3, the columns was first washed with 0.4 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid, and then IP3 was eluted with 0.8 M ammonium formate and 0.1 M formic acid. Radioactivity of [3H]inositol phosphates was determined by counting in a scintillation counter (Tri-Packard, Meriden, CT).Measurement of [Ca2+]iThe level of intracellular Ca2+ was determined using fura-2/AM(39.Suh B.C. Lee C.O. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1071-1079Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 3 μM fura-2/AM at 37°C for 50 min with continuous stirring. The cells were washed with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. Sulfinpyrazone (250 μM) was included in all solutions to prevent dye leakage from the cells. Before the measurement, a small portion of the cells was aliquoted into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged. The pelleted cells were resuspended in Ca2+-free Locke's solution (158.4 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, 10 mM glucose, and 0.2 mM EGTA, pH 7.3). Changes in fluorescence ratio were determined at dual excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission wavelength of 500 nm. The calibration of the fluorescence ratio in terms of [Ca2+]i was performed according to Grynkiewicz et al.(40.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar).Cell Binding ExperimentsPeptide (MKYMPM-NH2) was radiolabeled with 125I (IODO-GEN, Pierce)(41.Hulme E.C. Receptor-Ligand Interactions: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 1-18Google Scholar). U266 cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Binding was initiated with the addition of various amounts of 125I-labeled peptide. Equilibrium binding was established at room temperature for 90 min and terminated by rapid filtration through multiscreen-FB filters (Millipore Co.) followed by five washes with ice-cold binding buffer. The radioactivity of the punched filter membrane was determined in a γ-counter. The level of specific binding was determined after correction for the nonspecific binding occurring in the presence of 250-fold excess unlabeled peptide.RESULTSThe testing of each of total 114 peptide pools of PS-SPCLs permits the determination of the most effective amino acid at each of the six positions in a hexapeptide. The results of the initial screening of the peptide library are shown in Fig. 1. The peptide mixtures, WXXXXX-NH2, was found to strongly stimulate the formation of InoPs in U266 cells. The amino acids with slightly less active than tryptophan (W) at the first position were methionine (M) and arginine (R). For the second position, several amino acids appear to be active, lysine (K) and histidine (H) being slightly more active than others. The active amino acids at the third position were tyrosine (Y) and phenylalanine (F), tyrosine being slightly more active. The most active amino acid at the fourth position were methionine (M). Valine (V) and proline (P) appear to be more active than other amino acids at the fifth position. The sixth position showed marked contrast between the active amino acid (methionine, M) and other amino acids.The amino acids chosen for reiterative synthesis of peptides were as follows: 1st, W, M, and R; 2nd, K and H; 3rd, Y and F; 4th, M, V, and I; 5th, P, V, and R; and sixth, M. The selected amino acids at 4th, 5th, and 6th position were linked in all combinations, and for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions the mixtures of the selected amino acids used were: X1X2X3MPM-NH2, X1X2X3MVM-NH2, X1X2X3MRM-NH2, X1X2X3VPM-NH2, X1X2X3VVM-NH2, X1X2X3VRM-NH2, X1X2X3IPM-NH2, X1X2X3IVM-NH2, X1X2X3IRM-NH2. X1: W, M, R; X2: K, H; X3: Y, F.The reiterative synthesis generates nine peptide pools containing 3 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 1 = 108 individual hexapeptides. The nine peptide pools were tested for stimulation of the formation of InoPs. Among these, XXXMPM-NH2, XXXMVM-NH2 and XXXVPM-NH2 were found to be more active than others for formation of InoPs (Fig. 2A). Each active peptide pools was resolved and purified by using HPLC on a C18 column. Each peak fraction from the C18 column was tested for effect on the formation of InoPs, and the amino acid sequence of the active fractions were determined. Fig. 2B shows the result obtained with one of the active peptide WKYMVM-NH2. The peptide showed the half maximal activity at about 6 × 10-8M. Also, most of the active peptides have a consensus of XKYX(P/V)M. A time course study showed that the formation of IP3 reached a maximal level in 5 min and returned to a basal level in 20 min after the addition of the peptide to U266 cells. However, the formation of total InoPs was consistently elevated throughout the 20 min incubation with the peptides (data not shown).Figure 2:Effect of the peptide pools synthesized from the selected amino acids and the single selected peptide for their ability to stimulate the InoPs formation in U266 cell line. A, the first three positions consist of mixture (X) of defined amino acid (X1: W, M, R; X2: K, H; X3: Y, F). The remaining three positions were individually defined with each of the selected amino acids. The partial library consists of 9 mixtures; each mixture contains 12 single peptides. The total number of peptides in 9 mixtures were 12 × 9 = 108. Error bars were omitted for clarity of the figure. B, A peptide WKYMVM-NH2 selected from the experiment described above was tested for stimulation of InoPs formation in U266 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)IP3 is one of the major second messengers that triggers Ca2+ release from the internal Ca2+ pools in the cell. Generally, the elevation of [Ca2+]i is achieved by both Ca2+ release from the internal stores as well as by influx from the extracellular environment. Fig. 3A shows that there was peptide dose-dependent increase of [Ca2+]i. In order to determine the peptide-induced Ca2+ release from the internal stores, we measured the Ca2+ mobilization of U266 cell in Ca2+-free medium containing 0.2 mM EGTA. In addition, depleting intracellular free Ca2+ by preloading U266 cells with the Ca2+-buffering agent BAPTA completely inhibited the change in [Ca2+]i at maximal effective concentration of the peptide (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that the [Ca2+]i increase induced by the peptide was not due to mobilization from the extracellular Ca2+, but from the intracellular Ca2+ reservoir.Figure 3:Changes in [Ca2+]i after treatment with peptide in the absence of external Ca2+. A, [Ca2+]i was determined fluorometrically using fura-2/AM as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Before measurement, U266 cells (2 × 106) were suspended in Ca2+-free Locke's solution containing 0.2 mM EGTA. Cells were treated with various concentrations of WKYMVM-NH2 where indicated by the arrow. B, U266 cells in upper trace were stimulated with excess WKYMVM-NH2. Cells used in the lower trace (+ BAPTA label) had been preincubated in RPMI containing 60 μM BAPTA acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to investigate if the peptides have a general effect on other cell types, we examined the effect of an active peptide (WKYMVM-NH2) on the formation of InoPs in NIH3T3 (NIH Swiss mouse embryo fibroblast) and PC12 (rat adrenal pheochromocytoma) cells. It showed no effect on either cells (Fig. 4). Daudi (human Burkitt lymphoma), Sp2 (mouse myeloma), Jurkat (human acute T-cell leukemia), H9 (human T-cell lymphoma), Molt-4 (human peripheral blood T cell), SupT-1 (human T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma), K562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia), RBL-2H3 (rat mast cell), U937 and HL60 cells were tested for the effect of the peptide in a variety cell types originated from hemopoietic lineage. Among these cells, the peptide stimulated the formation of InoPs only in HL60 and U937 cell lines (Fig. 4). The results suggest that the peptides increase the formation of InoPs only in cell type-specific manner.Figure 4:Stimulation of InoPs formation by a peptide in various cell lines. Subconfluent cultures of each type were prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/106 cell) for 24 h in serum-free RPMI media. Cells were then treated with peptides (WKYMVM-NH2, 1 μM) in RPMI containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mM LiCl, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 37°C, and [3H]InoPs were extracted and separated by Dowex AG 1-X8 column as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Results are presented as the total InoPs and expressed as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PLC-γ is activated by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues. The activated PLC-γ catalyzes hydrolysis of PIP2 into two intracellular second messengers, IP3 and DAG(19.Park D. Jhon D.Y. Kriz R. Knopf J.L. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16048-16055Google Scholar). It is assumed that the phosphorylation of PLC-γ will lead to its activation. Experiments were therefore performed to investigate whether tyrosines of PLC-γ were phosphorylated in U266 cells in response to the peptides and whether the time course of the phosphorylation was compatible with the changes in the InoPs formation. However, there were no appreciable changes in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC γ1 and γ2 enzymes within the time period examined, although PLC γ1 and γ2 were clearly detectable in U266 cells (data not shown). This result suggests that the peptides may not induce PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i release through the activation of PLC-γ type.To investigate the possible involvement of a G-protein in the peptide-induced formation of InoPs, U266 cells were treated with pertussis toxin (150 ng/ml) for 12 h prior to the addition of WKYMVM-NH2. The peptide-dependent formation of InoPs was reduced by 70% (Fig. 5). AlF4- as a G-protein activator induced the InoPs formation in U266 cells. In addition, increasing amounts of WKYMVM-NH2 in the presence of a fixed amount of AlF4- showed no additive effect on the formation of InoPs (Fig. 6). These results support that pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins may be involved in the PLC-β mediated PI hydrolysis in response to the peptides in U266 cells.Figure 5:Effects of pertussis toxin on the peptide-induced formation of InoPs in U266 cells. Subconfluent cultures of each cell lines were prelabeled with myo-[3H]inositol (1 μCi/106 cell) for 24 h in serum-free RPMI media. U266 cells were treated with indicated concentration of WKYMVM-NH2 in the absence (•) or presence (○) of 150 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 12 h, and [3H]InoP formations were analyzed as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as means ± S.D. from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6:Lack of additive effect on the formation of InoPs by AlF4- and WKYMVM-NH2. myo-[3H]Inositol-labeled cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of WKYMVM-NH2 in the presence of AlF4- (20 μM AlCl3/10 mM NaF) after then, perchloric acid added and InoPs formation was quantitated as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” The data are the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To investigate the possible action of the peptide through the binding to a cell-surface receptor, a fixed number of U266 cells was incubated for 90 min at room temperature in the presence of the various concentrations of 125I-labeled peptide. After washing the cells, we determined the amount of bound 125I-labeled peptide using multiscreen binding assay system (Millipore). A representative result of these assays is shown in Fig. 7. As the concentration of 125I-labeled peptide increased, there was a corresponding increase in the amount of the peptide bound to the cells until it reached a plateau, suggesting that there is a saturable number of binding sites for the peptide on the surface of U266 cells. On the other hand, fMLP is known as the peptide that stimulates the formation of InoPs through the cell-surface receptor which is coupled with a G-protein in neutrophils(42.Boulay F. Tardif M. Brouchon L. Vignais P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11123-11133Google Scholar, 43.Sengelov H. Boulay F. Kjeldsen L. Borregaard N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 473-479Google Scholar, 44.Prossnitz E.R. Quehenberger O. Cochrane C.G. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5704-5715Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that the peptides we have identified in this study act on the fMLP receptor. However, fMLP showed no effect on the formation of InoPs in U266 cells (Fig. 8). Therefore, it appears that our peptide does not bind to the fMLP receptor.Figure 7:Binding of 125I-MKYMPM-NH2 to U266 cells. U266 cells (106) in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin were incubated with an increasing concentrations of 125I-MKYMPM-NH2 for 90 min at room temperature. Each data point represents specific binding, which was computed by subtracting nonspecific binding in the presence of excess unlabeled peptide from total binding.

https://openalex.org/W1557487116,"Using autoantibodies from a Sjögren's syndrome patient, we have previously identified a 230-kDa peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytosolic face of the trans-Golgi (Kooy, J., Toh, B. H., Pettitt, J. M., Erlich, R. and Gleeson, P. A.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20255-20263). Here we report the molecular cloning and sequence analysis of human p230 and the localization of its gene to chromosome 6p12-22. Partial cDNA clones, isolated from a HeLa cell cDNA library using autoantibodies, were used to obtain additional cDNAs, which together span 7695 base pairs (bp). The p230 mRNA is ∽7.7 kilobases. Two alternatively spliced mRNAs for p230 were detected. These differed by 21- and 63-bp insertions in the 3′-sequence, resulting in differences in amino acid sequence at the carboxyl terminus. The predicted 261-kDa protein is highly hydrophilic with 17-20% homology with many proteins containing coiled-coil domains. Apart from two proline-rich regions (amino acids 1-117 and 239-270), p230 contains a very high frequency of heptad repeats, characteristic of α-helices that form dimeric coiled-coil structures. p230 also includes the sequence ESLALEELEL (amino acids 538-546), a motif found in the granin family of acidic proteins present in secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. This is the first report of a cytosolic Golgi protein containing a granin motif. The structural characteristics of p230 indicate that it may play a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi. Using autoantibodies from a Sjögren's syndrome patient, we have previously identified a 230-kDa peripheral membrane protein associated with the cytosolic face of the trans-Golgi (Kooy, J., Toh, B.

This is the first report of a cytosolic Golgi protein containing a granin motif. The structural characteristics of p230 indicate that it may play a role in vesicular transport from the trans-Golgi. The Golgi apparatus is a highly complex and dynamic organelle organized into three functionally distinct regions: the cis, medial, and trans cisternae of the Golgi stack and two tubulovesicular networks, namely the cis-Golgi network and the trans-Golgi network(1.Rothman J.E. Orci L. Nature. 1992; 355: 409-415Google Scholar, 2.Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Google Scholar). Transport of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi cisternae, between adjacent cisternae, and from the cisternae to various destinations is mediated by vesicles shuttling between donor and recipient compartments(3.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar). Numerous structural and regulatory proteins have been implicated in the budding, docking, and fusion of vesicles(3.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 4.Pryer N.K. Wuestehube L.J. Schekman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 471-516Google Scholar, 5.Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Google Scholar). Soluble proteins involved in budding of vesicles include COPI and COPII coat proteins and the small GTP binding protein ARF-1. A N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment proteins (SNAPs) ( 1The abbreviations used are: SNAPssoluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment proteinsSNARESNAP receptorsPBSphosphate-buffered salinePCRpolymerase chain reaction.) and Rabs are involved in either vesicle docking or membrane fusion(3.Rothman J.E.

SNAP receptors (SNAREs), membrane proteins that form oligomeric complexes with SNAPs and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteins, are considered to promote fusion of vesicles with target membranes after specific docking mediated by SNAREs on vesicle and target membranes (3.Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar). However, many facets of the transport process remain unresolved. For example, the protein coat structures that mediate forward vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus have not been fully characterized. soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment proteins SNAP receptors phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction. Additional peripheral membrane Golgi proteins have also been implicated in vesicular transport, for example three high molecular weight proteins in cis to medial Golgi transport(9.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Google Scholar). One of these, p115, contains coiled-coil domains and is related to Uso1p required for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(10.Sapperstein S.K. Walter D.M. Grosvenor A.R. Heuser J.E. Waters M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 522-526Google Scholar). Two peripheral membrane proteins have been implicated in budding of vesicles from the trans-Golgi network, namely p200, which associates with coated vesicles arising from the trans-Golgi network(11.Narula A. Stow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2874-2878Google Scholar), and p62, which forms a complex with TGN38/41 and Rab6(12.Jones S.M. Crosby J.R. Salamero J. Howell K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 775-788Google Scholar). Human autoantibodies are valuable reagents for identification of novel intracellular proteins. Using anti-Golgi autoantibodies from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome, we have previously identified a brefeldin A-sensitive peripheral membrane protein of 230 kDa (p230) localized to the cytosolic face of trans-Golgi(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). Other novel Golgi proteins have also been identified using autoantibodies, including golgins-95 and −160(14.Fritzler M.J. Hamel J.C. Ochs R.L. Chan E.K.L. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 49-62Google Scholar), a protein of ∽370 kDa(15.Seelig H.P. Schranz P. Schröter H. Wieman C. Renz M. J. Autoimmunity. 1994; 7: 67-91Google Scholar, 16.Sohda M. Misumi Y. Fujiwara T. Nishioka M. Ikeharas Y. Biochem. Biopys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1399-1408Google Scholar), which appears to be identical to giantin(17.Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Google Scholar), and a cis-Golgi network p210 protein(18.Rios R.M. Tassin A.M. Celati C. Antony C. Boissier M.C. Homberg J.C. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 997-1013Google Scholar). For those Golgi proteins where sequences are known, a common structural feature is a high content of predicted coiled-coil domains. Here we have cloned and sequenced p230. The predicted protein consists of α-helical coiled-coil domains with abundant heptad repeats and contains a granin motif shared with proteins found in secretory vesicles. We propose that p230 has a role in membrane transport of proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Autoimmune sera were obtained from Gribbles Pathology (Melbourne, Australia). Sera were treated at 56°C for 30 min to inactivate complement, and aliquots in 0.02% sodium azide were stored at −70°C. Indirect immunofluorescence using human Hep2 cells (Kallstead) was performed as described previously(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of HeLa cell extracts and recombinant p230 bacterial fusion protein was performed as described previously(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). 105 recombinants of a λgt11 HeLa cell cDNA library (Clontech HL1022) were immunoscreened with autoimmune serum from a Sjögren's syndrome patient diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). Positive plaques, detected with125I-labeled protein A, were rescreened and plaque-purified. These cDNA clones were subcloned into pBluescribe M13+ (Stratagene) for sequencing. Additional cDNA clones were obtained by subsequently screening a λZAP Hepatoma cDNA library (Stratagene 935202) with 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Positive plaques were purified, and plasmids were rescued according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 32P-labeled cDNA probes were derived initially from the λgt11 clones and subsequently from λZAP clones. In addition, a 32P-labeled 45-mer based on sequence from a λZAP cDNA clone was constructed from partially overlapping 30-mers, 5′-GAGCTAATCAACATTAGTAGTAGTAAAACT-3′ and 5′-AGAAAGAATGGCATTAGTTTTACTACTACT-3′ by a method described by Alderuccio et al.(19.Alderuccio F. Toh B.H. Tan S.S. Gleeson P.A. van Driel I.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 419-426Google Scholar). Finally, a random-primed HeLa cell cDNA library in pUEX (20.Bressan G.M. Stanley K.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10056Google Scholar) was screened with a 32P-labeled 240-bp fragment obtained by PCR using a λZAP clone as template. Nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones clone was determined by the dideoxy method, using a deaza reagent sequencing kit (Promega) in conjuction with T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or by automated sequencing using a Prism DyeDeoxy terminator cycle kit and a 373A DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). To induce the expression of β-galactosidase fusion protein, nitrocellulose filters impregnated with 10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside were overlaid on agar plates containing λgt11 plaques for 3 h at 42°C. The filters were then washed in PBS, blocked in 3% casein, and incubated with autoimmune serum, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, the bound antibodies were eluted from the filters by gently rocking in 3 M KSCN. The eluate was dialyzed overnight in PBS and concentrated approximately 20-fold using Centricon filters (Amicon). Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells by guanidium thiocyanate extraction followed by ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.51Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the RNA pellets were resuspended in formamide for storage and precipitated in four volumes of ethanol before use(22.Chomczynski P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3791-3792Google Scholar). HeLa cell RNA (2 μg) was heated to 70°C for 2 min, and cDNA was synthesized using 5 μg/ml oligo(dT) (Promega) and 100 units of murine superscript reverse transriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 1 mM of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Pharmacia), and 20-40 units of RNAsin (Promega) at 37°C for 2 h. Reactions were also carried out without reverse transcriptase or without RNA. Half of the volume of these reactions was used as templates for PCR. Oligonucleotide primers were used at 0.2 pmol/μl in the presence of 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 0.2 mM of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.016 units of cloned Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers (produced by Department of Microbiology, Monash University or by Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia) were as follows: P1 (5′-GCTCTAGATCAAGGAGGAGACGGCGA-3′), P2 (5′-CCTCAGTAAGACTTTCTA-3′), P3 (5′-CCCAAGTCTATGAGTCCA-3′), P4 (5′-GCGTCGACCACTGCCAACAATCACAG-3′), and P5 (5′-TTGGTCCAACCCAAATTG-3′). Cycle conditions for P1/P2 and P4/P5 were as follows: 1 cycle of 5 min at 95°C, 1.5 min at 55°C, and 3 min at 72°C and 29 cycles of 1.5 min at 95°C, 1.5 min at 55°C, and 3 min at 72°C. Cycle conditions for P3/P4 were as above except that the annealing temperature was 60°C. PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then transfered to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.) in 0.4 M NaOH for 4 h. Membranes were then incubated with prehybridization buffer (0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM Na3C6H5O7.2H2O, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.0, 7% SDS, and 0.5% skim milk powder) for 30 min at 65°C and hybridized overnight at 65°C with 32P-labeled DNA (specific activity, >5 × 108 cpm/μg) in prehybridization buffer. Membranes were washed at 65°C in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3C6H5O7•2H2O, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% SDS and exposed to x-ray film (Fuji, Ashigara, Japan). - Total RNA was prepared from HeLa cells as described above and enriched for poly(A)+ RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography using a poly(A) tract mRNA isolation system (Promega). Poly(A)+ RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose formaldehyde gel and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Corp.) in 0.05 M NaOH for 2 h. After transfer, lanes containing RNA markers were cut into strips and stained in methylene blue(21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19-7.51Google Scholar). The remaining membrane was incubated with 32P-labeled DNA probes as described for Southern analysis. The membranes were stripped for reprobing by the addition of 0.5% SDS at 100°C followed by cooling to room temperature. The removal of the 32P-labeled probe was confirmed by autoradiography. Analyses were carried out using the MacVector program (International Biotechnologies, Inc) or using on-line software provided by the Australian National Genome Information Service including the FASTA program,(23.Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Google Scholar), the pattern library search program of Smith and Smith(24.Smith R.F. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar) using the STRIPE program for the Macintosh. ( 2A. C. E. Knight, unpublished results.) Human chromosome metaphase spreads were obtained from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures synchronized with fluorodeoxyuridine (28.Webber L.M. Garson O.M. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1983; 8: 123-132Google Scholar) according to standard cytogenetic procedures. The method of in situ hybridization was modified from Harper and Saunders (29.Harper M.E. Saunders G.F. Chromosoma. 1981; 83: 431-439Google Scholar) and Choo et al.(30.Choo K.H. Brown R.M. Earle E. Matthew C.G. Protocol in Human Molecular Genetics. 7. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1991: 233-254Google Scholar). The λg5 clone, labeled by random priming using [3H]dATP, [3H]dCTP, and [3H]dTTP to a specific activity of 2.04 × 108 cpm/μg DNA was added to the hybridization solution and hybridized to chromosome preparations overnight at 40°C. After washes in 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M Na3C6H507•2H20, pH 7.0, at 42°C, slides were dipped in EM-1 hypercoat nuclear emulsion (Amersham Corp.) and exposed for 8-33 days at 4°C. Autoradiographs were developed, and chromosomes were G-banded in 2-5% Gurr's improved R66 Giemsa stain (Merck, Kilsyth, Australia) in 0.15 M Na2HPO4, pH 11, for 8 min(31.Webber L.M. Garson O.M. Pathology. 1983; 15: 112Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The distribution of silver grains over chromosomes was analyzed. We have identified two autoimmune sera that show strong staining of the Golgi apparatus by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1) and that immunoblot a 230-kDa protein in HeLa cell extracts (Fig. 2). One of these sera (autoimmune serum 1), from a patient with Sjögren's syndrome(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar), has high titre anti-Golgi autoantibodies by immunofluorescence (1:100,000) as well as lower titre (1:20,000) antinuclear antibodies. Immunoscreening a HeLa cell λgt11 cDNA expression library with diluted Sjögren's syndrome autoimmune serum yielded four clones designated λg2, λg5, λg7, and λg12 (Fig. 3). Autoantibodies eluted from nitrocellulose lifts of purified phage from each of the four clones showed immunofluorescence staining of the Golgi apparatus, whereas elution of bound antibodies from an irrelevant clone showed no staining (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the eluted autoantibodies showed no nuclear staining. These results indicate that all four clones encode Golgi-associated proteins. Clone λg5 was used to generate a bacterial fusion protein, using the expression vector pGEX(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). The two autoimmune sera specifically reacted with the 51-kDa glutathionine S-transferase fusion protein by immunoblotting (Fig. 2; see also (13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar)). As reported previously(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar), affinity-purified Sjögren's syndrome autoantibody eluted from the 51-kDa recombinant fusion protein not only reacted with the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells by immunofluorescence but also immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted a 230-kDa protein; furthermore, a rabbit antibody raised to the 51-kDa fusion protein gave specific immunofluorescence of the Golgi apparatus and immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated the 230-kDa protein. These results confirm that clone λg5 encodes a polypeptide derived from p230.Figure 2:Immunoblot analysis of cell extracts and bacterial fusion protein with autoimmune serum 2. HeLa cell proteins (A) and total proteins from isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside-treated E. coli DH1 cells transformed with recombinant pGEX-clone λg5 autoantigen (B) were separated under reducing conditions on a 5 or 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, respectively, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with autoimmune serum 2 (AIS) or normal human serum (NHS) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-human immunoglobulin. Bound immunoglobulin was detected by Enhanced Chemiluminesence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3:Map of p230 cDNA clones. Clones λg2, λg5, λg7, and λg12 were isolated from a λgt11 HeLa cell cDNA library by immunoscreening with autoimmune serum 1. A λZAP hepatoma cDNA library was screened with λg5 yielding clones λz2 and λz6; screening the same library with λz6 resulted in clones λz7a and λz8a, which also showed positive hybridization with λg5. The λZAP Hepatoma cDNA library was also screened with a 300-bp fragment of λg7 resulting in λz7, λz8, and λz16, while a 45-bp segment of λz6 identified λz9. Finally, a PCR-generated fragment of the 5′ region of λz9 was used to screen a pUEX HeLa cell cDNA plasmid library, identifying clone px1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The four clones (λg2, λg5, λg7, and λg12) showed an overlapping nucleotide sequence spanning approximately 2.0 kb (Fig. 3). To obtain additional sequence, we recreened a λZAP cDNA hepatoma library using clone λg5 as probe. Two further clones, designated λz2 and λz6, were isolated (Fig. 3). Further screening of the same library with λz6 resulted in clones λz7a and λz8a. These latter clones also gave positive hybridization signals with clone λg5, and DNA sequencing confirmed their overlapping sequence. Screening the λZAP hepatoma library with a 300-bp HincII fragment of λg7 identified clones λz7, λz8, and λz16, and screening with a 45-bp segment of λz6 identified λz9 (Fig. 3). The 5′-sequence was obtained from clone px1, isolated by screening a randomly primed HeLa cell plasmid cDNA library with a PCR-generated 240-bp fragment of the 5′-region of λz9. Together, all of the clones (Fig. 3) comprise 7.7 kb of cDNA, as determined by nucleotide sequencing. Three of the cDNA clones, namely px1, λz9, and λz16, collectively span the entire 7.7-kb cDNA. Northern analysis showed that the three clones, px1, λz9, and λz16 all hybridized with a similar sized transcript from HeLa cell poly(A)+ RNA of about 7.7 kb (Fig. 4a). To confirm that the overlapping clones shown in Fig. 3 were derived from the same transcript, reverse transcriptase PCR was carried out using total RNA isolated from HeLa cells and oligonucleotide primers as indicated in Fig. 4b. A 3.2-kb product was obtained using primers P1 and P2, and a 4.7-kb product was generated using primers P3 and P4; the sizes of these PCR products were in accordance with that expected from the nucleotide sequence of the clones. The identity of the PCR products was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using internal probes. The P1/P2 product was probed with a 1.3-kb fragment from clone px1 and the P3/P4 product with the above mentioned 45-mer (Fig. 4b). Taken together, our data imply that we have isolated a full-length cDNA encoding p230. The clones shown in Fig. 3 gave identical sequences in the overlap regions. The nucleotide sequence reported here was verified by either sequence of both strands of a cDNA clone, identical sequences from at least one other independent clone, or from reverse transcriptase PCR products. However, two small differences were detected in the three 3′ clones. These differences comprised a 21-bp stretch (nucleotide 6592-6612) present in clones λz7 and λz8, but absent in λz16 and a 63-bp stretch (nucleotide 6950-7012) present in λz7 but absent from clones λz16 and λz8 (Fig. 5). The absence of the 21 nucleotides does not disrupt the open reading frame but results in the loss of the amino acids VTIMELQ, while the absence of the 63 nucleotides results in insertion of an alternative stop codon and the amino acid sequence of p230 ending in SWLRSSS rather than FTSPRSGIF. Reverse transcriptase PCR using oligonucleotide primers P4 and P5 resulted in two products of 1.5 and 1.6 kb, sizes consistent with the 63- and 21-bp insertion and deletion (Fig. 6). There is a unique HincII site in the 63-bp insertion, and as expected, the 1.6-kb PCR product was susceptible to HincII digestion, giving the expected fragments of 0.98 and 0.64 kb. These results indicate the presence of alternatively spliced mRNAs derived from the same gene. Whether these different mRNAs represent regulated splicing events or products from inaccurate splicing is not known.Figure 6:cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence of p230. Nucleotide sequence of p230 is shown, together with the predicted sequence of the encoded polypeptide. Proline-rich regions of the predicted polypeptide (see text; domains 1 and 3) are shaded and the granin signature is boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The nucleotide sequence of p230 cDNA comprises 7695 bp and contains an open reading frame of 6690 bp (Fig. 6). The open reading frame spans an in-frame ATG initiation codon at nucleotide position 286 and a TGA termination codon at position 6976. A second potential ATG initiation codon is located at nucleotide 388. Both initiation codons have a purine residue 3 bases 5′ upstream of the ATG, representing favorable translation initiation sites(32.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Google Scholar). Based on the linear scanning model of translation initiation(33.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar), the first AUG initiation codon would be expected to be the dominant signal. The TGA codon is followed by a polyadenylation signal AATAAA (34.Wickens M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 277-324Google Scholar) at position 7660 and a poly(A) tail from position 7679 to 7694. The open reading frame encodes a putative polypeptide of 2230 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 261,126 Da and a pI of 5.16. The amino acid composition of this putative polypeptide is rich in glutamic acid (16.6%), lysine (12.7%), leucine (12.5%), and glutamine (10.1%) residues. Comparison with the GenBank(™) data base reveals regions of p230, which are identical or nearly identical to 15 previously isolated partial cDNA clones of no known function. A list of these loci together with the corresponding regions of identity in p230 is given in Table 1.Tabled 1 Comparison of the translated amino acid sequence of p230 with the translated GenBank(™) data base reveals significant homology (17-27% identity) with many proteins known or predicted to encode coiled-coil domains. These include various conventional and nonconventional myosins, tropomyosins, cytokeratins, vimentin, neurofilaments, laminin, hemeolytic streptococcal M proteins, dystrophin, the Golgi proteins golgin-95, golgin-160, and giantin, the Uso1 protein of S. cerevisiae implicated in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport and its mammalian homologue p115 or TAP, and the early endosome-associated protein EEA-1(35.Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Google Scholar). In addition, this homology was shared with other structural and motor proteins of the cytoskeleton including human cytoplasmic linker protein-170, kinetocore protein CENP-E, lamins, dynein, and kinesins. In general, this pattern of identity was scattered throughout the length of p230, although similar comparisons with translated GenBank(™) sequences using a series of overlapping segments of p230 revealed that such homology was less pronounced in the amino-terminal 130 amino acids of p230. There are two proline-rich domains at the amino terminus of the putative polypeptide; amino acids 1-117 contains 6.8% proline residues, while the segment from amino acids 239-270 contains 18.8% proline residues (Fig. 6), suggesting a compact structure for these domains. The remainder of the protein has scant proline residues, most of which are clustered at the extreme carboxyl terminus. Thus, p230 can be divided into four putative domains on the basis of its proline distribution, i.e. domain 1 (amino acids 1-117), domain 2 (amino acids 118-238), domain 3 (amino acids 239-270), and domain 4 (amino acids 271-2230). These analyses are consistent with the two proline-rich domains having a high probability of globular structures and an elongated structure for the intervening domains 2 and 4(36.Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Google Scholar). These features are supported by results of secondary structure predictions (Fig. 7), which suggest a predominantly α-helical structure for p230 with the exception of the proline-rich domains 1 and 3. Analyses of hydrophilicity (Fig. 7) suggest a predominantly hydrophilic structure, with no evidence for a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, consistent with biochemical data reported by Kooy et al.(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). Charge plots (not shown) show no evidence for discrete acidic or basic domains. The above features raised the possibility that p230 adopts a coiled-coil structure, stabilized by heptad repeats. A search for these structures was performed using the method of Lupas et al.(26.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Google Scholar). The results of this analysis (Fig. 8a) reveal an extraordinarily high level of heptad repeats in domains 2 and 4, which predict a coiled-coiled structure with a high degree of confidence. Detailed sequence analysis of the longest of these regions is shown in Fig. 8b, which shows a run of 31 heptad repeats extending over 245 amino acids with four heptad frame-shifts. In common with various fibrous coiled-coil proteins(37.Parry D.A.D. Biosci. Rep. 1982; 2: 1017-1026Google Scholar, 38.McLachlan A.D. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 164: 605-626Google Scholar), this region shows a high frequency of apolar residues in positions a (75%) and d (52%) of the heptads and the absence of acidic residues in these positions. The preference for leucine over isoleucine at the d position suggests that the protein has a dimeric rather than a trimeric quaternary structure(39.Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar, 40.Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Google Scholar). This region also shares with the fibrous proteins a high frequency (54.9%) of charged residues in the outer positions (b, c, e, f, and g), with only 14.3% of residues in these positions being apolar. However, in contrast to the fibrous proteins, this region has a relatively high number of lysine and arginine residues in the d position, which, together with the concomitant reduction in apolar residues at this position and the presence of other discontinuities including frameshifts and #x0201C;stutter residues,” would be expected to confer marginal stability on the coiled-coil(36.Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Trends Biochem Sci. 1986; 11: 245-248Google Scholar). p230 has multiple consensus motifs for tyrosine phosphorylation, protein kinase C phosphorylation, casein kinase II phosphorylation, cAMP/cGMP phosphorylation, N-myristoylation, and N-glycosylation. It is not known at present how many of these motifs are utilized; however, p230 appears to be devoid of N-glycans(13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar), consistent with location of the protein on the cytoplasmic face of Golgi membranes. p230 also contains between amino acids 538 and 546 the sequence ESLALEELEL, a motif found in otherwise diverse members of the granin (chromogranin/secretogranin) family of acidic proteins found in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells. A search of the translated GenBank(™) data base revealed that in addition to chromogranins, this region and its immediate flanking sequence showed homology with a number of proteins involved in subcellular compartmentalization and motor functions, including flagellin, calnexin, the Golgi protein giantin, β8-tubulin, neurofilament L, caldesmon, chromokinesin, and with the human microtubule-associated protein E-MAP-115. No known microtubule binding motifs were found in p230. Using λg5 clone as a probe, individual grains recorded on a cumulative idiogram revealed a significant accumulation of signal on a region of the short arm of human chromosome 6, assigning the probe to 6p12-22. Fig. 9a shows a diagrammatic presentation of the genomic distribution of grains observed in 70 metaphase spreads on one slide. An enlarged diagram of the grains recorded on chromosome 6, showing a peak at 6p12-22, together with photographs of a silver grain located at the specific site of hybridization, are shown in Fig. 9b. The cDNA clones we have isolated encode the full-length p230 Golgi protein for the following reasons. First, autoantibodies, affinity-purified from clones λg2, λg5, λg7, and λg12, gave immunofluorescence staining of the Golgi apparatus of Hep2 cells. Second, rabbit antibodies raised against a bacterial fusion protein incorporating clone λg5 not only stained the Golgi apparatus by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, but also immunoblotted and immunoprecipitated a 230-kDa protein from HeLa cells (13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar). Third, cDNAs of clones px1, λz9, and λz16 together span 7.7 kb, in agreement with the size of the mRNA obtained from Northern blots; and fourth, reverse transcripase PCR demonstrated that these three clones were derived from the same transcript. The deduced amino acid sequence of p230 suggests a hydrophilic, modestly acidic protein capable of forming a dimeric coiled coil structure. While most (>90%) of the protein is predicted to form this structure, the extreme amino-terminal 130 amino acids and a segment between amino acids 239 and 270 are predicted to form compact structures consistent with globular regions. While it is well established that stable static coiled coils can serve as multimerization motifs in structural proteins, dynamic coiled-coil formation can play a central role in generation of conformational changes resulting in dramatic movements of one part of a protein relative to another. Such coiled-coil regions have been implicated in the function of the nonclaret disjunctional kinesin-related microtubule motor protein, which translocates on microtubules toward their minus ends and is required for proper chromosome segregation in Drosophila oocytes(41.Endow S.A. Chandra R. Komma D.J. Yamamoto A.H. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 859-867Google Scholar). This protein has a central stalk region consisting of heptad repeats predicted to form coiled-coils. A mutant that lacks the amino-terminal third of the coiled-coil stalk exhibits partial loss of function, having a translocation velocity and torque generation similar to wild-type protein, but only partially rescues a null mutant for chromosome missegregation. A similar effect has been reported for a cytoplasmic myosin II protein partially deleted for its coiled-coil tail(42.Kubalek E.W. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudlich J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1455-1462Google Scholar). In this case, the mutant protein is expressed at a level comparable with the wild-type protein and translocates on actin filaments in vitro with the same velocity as wild-type protein, but in spite of this, exhibits frequent failure of cytokinesis in vivo. Of particular interest is the loss of function reported for partial deletions of the coiled-coil domain of the yeast Uso1 protein(43.Seog D.H. Kito M. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1341-1345Google Scholar), a protein involved in vesicular transport, where such mutations are temperature-sensitive lethal, resulting in a severe defect of endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi protein transport at the nonpermissive temperature. It has been suggested that a key structural feature of coiled-coils that participate in conformational changes is the presence of regions of marginal stability caused by discontinuities in heptad repeats of the coiled coil as a result of deletions, insertions, or out-of-frame residues(44.Oas T.G. Endow S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 51-54Google Scholar). The presence of extensive regions of this type in p230 raises the possibility of dynamic coiled-coil formation, which could play a role in regulation of multimerization or in induction of conformational changes in the protein. Dramatic conformational changes have been found to occur in other coiled-coil proteins involved in membrane fusion events (for review, see (44.Oas T.G. Endow S.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 51-54Google Scholar)). p230 also has a short region of homology to the conserved carboxyl-terminal domain of the granin (chromogranin/secretogranin) family of proteins, a diverse group of acidic proteins present in secretory granules of endocrine and neuroendocrine cells (for review, see (45.Huttner W.B. Gerdes H.H. Rosa P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 27-30Google Scholar)). Granins are suggested to be precursors of several peptide hormones and to regulate proteolytic processing and selective aggregation of secretory proteins in the trans-Golgi network of neuroendocrine cells(46.Huttner W.B. Natori S. Curr Biol. 1995; 5: 242-245Google Scholar). Only one short region at the carboxyl terminus is shared among the granins. This region bears the consensus sequence E(N/S)LX(A/D)X(D/E)XEL which is closely related to a sequence found in p230 (Fig. 6). A short region of the carboxyl terminus of chromogranin A, containing the granin motif, may be responsible for pH-regulated multimerization of the protein (47.Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8816-8822Google Scholar) and, together with the pH-dependent association of chromogranin A with integral membrane proteins of the secretory vesicle, suggests a role for chromogranins A in the sorting of these membrane proteins during vesicle biogenesis in the trans-Golgi network(48.Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Google Scholar). However, the relevance of this motif in p230 is unclear since p230 is orientated on the cytosolic side of Golgi membranes. There is an increasing number of proteins implicated in vesicular transport that have extensive coiled-coil domains. These domains have potential for dynamic interactions associated with this highly complex process. The potential dynamic coiled-coil structure of p230, its localization to the trans-Golgi network, ( 3P. A. Gleeson and G. Griffiths, unpublished results.) and sensitivity to brefeldin A (13.Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Google Scholar) suggest that p230 may have a key role in vesicular transport from this distal Golgi compartment.

https://openalex.org/W2129946929,"We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the noncompetitive inhibitor (Kis = 27 μM, Kii = 48 μM with respect to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and Kis = 144 μM, Kii = 176 μM with respect to NADPH) 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acid (XAN) and human glutathione reductase (hGR). The structure, refined to an R-factor of 0.158 at 2.0 Å resolution, reveals XAN bound in the large cavity present at the hGR dimer interface where it does not overlap the glutathione binding site. The inhibitor binding causes extensive local structural changes that primarily involve amino acid residues from a 30-residue α-helix that lines the cavity and contributes to the active site of hGR. Despite the lack of physical overlap of XAN with the GSSG binding site, no GSSG binding is seen in soaks carried out with high XAN and GSSG concentrations, suggesting that some subtle interaction between the sites exists. An earlier crystallographic analysis on the complex between hGR and 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride (safranin) showed that safranin bound at this same site. We have found that safranin also inhibits hGR in a noncompetitive fashion, but it binds about 16 times less tightly (Kis = 453 μM, Kii = 586 μM with respect to GSSG) than XAN and does not preclude the binding of GSSG in the crystal. Although in structure-based drug design competitive inhibitors are usually targetted, XAN's binding to a well defined site that is unique to glutathione reductase suggests that noncompetitive inhibitors could also serve as lead compounds for structure-based drug design, in particular as components of chimeric inhibitors. We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the noncompetitive inhibitor (Kis = 27 μM, Kii = 48 μM with respect to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and Kis = 144 μM, Kii = 176 μM with respect to NADPH) 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acid (XAN) and human glutathione reductase (hGR).

An earlier crystallographic analysis on the complex between hGR and 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride (safranin) showed that safranin bound at this same site. We have found that safranin also inhibits hGR in a noncompetitive fashion, but it binds about 16 times less tightly (Kis = 453 μM, Kii = 586 μM with respect to GSSG) than XAN and does not preclude the binding of GSSG in the crystal. Although in structure-based drug design competitive inhibitors are usually targetted, XAN's binding to a well defined site that is unique to glutathione reductase suggests that noncompetitive inhibitors could also serve as lead compounds for structure-based drug design, in particular as components of chimeric inhibitors. Malaria is one of the world's most devastating diseases. According to the World Health Organization, 300 million cases of malaria are recorded each year with a fatality exceeding 2 million per annum(1.Cattani J. Davidson D. Engers H. Tropical Disease Research: Progress 1991-1992, Program Report No. 11. World Health Organization, 1993Google Scholar). The causative agents of malaria are parasitic protozoa of the genus Plasmodium, which infect human erythrocytes and are transmitted by anopheles mosquitoes. Numerous strains of Plasmodium falciparum, the most aggressive species, have developed resistance to currently used drugs; therefore the development of novel, effective chemotherapeutic agents is essential(2.Schirmer R.H. Müller J.G. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 141-154Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Intracellular parasites such as the P. falciparum require a highly efficient thiol metabolism to protect themselves from intracellular reactive oxygen species and their derivatives(3.Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1984; 6: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This implies that they are highly susceptible to oxidative stress and that this sensitivity is a promising target for drug action(4.Hunt N.H. Stocker R. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 499-530PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Schirmer R.H. Schöllhammer T. Eisenbrand G. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Free Rad. Res. Commun. 1987; 3: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The role of oxidative stress as an important mechanism for the destruction of parasites and tumor cells (6.Müller J.G. Bücheler U.S. Kayser K. Schirmer R.H. Werner D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1993; 39: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar) is particularly well illustrated by many congenital and acquired factors that generate oxidative stress in human erythrocytes and offer partial protection against malaria(4.Hunt N.H. Stocker R. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 499-530PubMed Google Scholar). Central to defense against intracellular oxidative stress in humans is the glutathione redox cycle, which involves the enzymes human glutathione reductase (hGR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: hGRhuman glutathione reductaseGRglutathione reductaseGSSGglutathione (oxidized form)XAN6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acidsafranin3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride.) and glutathione peroxidase. The flavoenzyme hGR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent recycling of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to maintain high levels of reduced glutathione as shown by the equation below(7.Williams Jr., C.H. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar).GSSG+NADPH+H+⇌2GSH+NADP+(Eq. 1) human glutathione reductase glutathione reductase glutathione (oxidized form) 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acid 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride. Despite the importance of hGR, there is good evidence that hGR is not essential for normal erythrocyte function and that the reduced life-span of hGR-deficient red blood cells is tolerable(8.Schirmer R.H. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Schulz G.E. Glutathione. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 553-596Google Scholar). As reviewed by Schirmer et al.(2.Schirmer R.H. Müller J.G. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 141-154Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar), hGR is thus a reasonable target for rational drug design. In this direction, various compounds have been reported to inhibit hGR(9.Becker K. Christopherson R.I. Cowden W.B. Hunt N.H. Schirmer R.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 10.Elliot A.J. Scheiber S.A. Thomas C. Pardini R.S. Biochem.

Biochem. 1988; 171: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In choosing hGR as a target for structure-based drug design, we have considered, in addition to the enzyme's physiological importance, the plethora of structural information that is available; the three-dimensional structure of hGR has been solved and refined to 1.54 Å resolution, and its catalytic mechanism has been well established from crystal structures of the enzyme complexed with its natural substrates GSSG and NADPH, substrate analogues, and various other ligands(12.Karplus P.A.

Furthermore, the gene for hGR has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, which makes possible the study of structure-function relations through the generation of site-directed mutants(18.Bücheler S.U. Werner D. Schirmer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In a recent study on the prediction of ligand binding to proteins by affinity fingerprinting methods(19.Kauvar L.M. Higgins D.L. Villar H.O. Sportsman R.J. Engqvist-Goldstein Å. Bukar R. Bauer K.E. Dilley H. Rocke D.M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), yeast glutathione reductase was used as one of the model protein drug targets. The study identified a number of tight binding inhibitors from a variety of chemical families, yet their modes of action were not investigated. Because yeast glutathione reductase and hGR are homologous (48% overall amino acid sequence identity), we have tested some of the yeast GR inhibitors as inhibitors of hGR and found that they exhibit diverse modes of inhibition. One of them, 6-hydroxy-3-oxo-3H-xanthene-9-propionic acid (XAN), is a noncompetitive inhibitor that binds in a cavity of hGR where the dye 3,7-diamino-2,8-dimethyl-5-phenyl-phenazinium chloride (safranin) had been previously seen to bind(13.Karplus P.A. Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As a result of this finding we have also assessed the inhibition of hGR by safranin, which also behaved as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to GSSG, yet its inhibition potency was 16 times weaker than XAN. Here, we report on the inhibition of hGR by these two compounds and on the crystal structure of hGR in complex with XAN at 2.0 Å resolution. All reagents used were of the highest purity available and were purchased from Aldrich, Fisher, Sigma, and Amicon. An overexpression system for hGR (18.Bücheler S.U. Werner D. Schirmer R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3127-3133Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20.Tutic M. Lu X. Schirmer R.H. Werner D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Dieter Werner and Dr. Heiner Schirmer (University of Heidelberg, Germany). A preparation protocol for the recombinant enzyme has been published(21.Nordhoff A. Bücheler U.S. Werner D. Schirmer R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4060-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), but for our preparations (10-liter cell cultures), we found that additional steps were essential to obtain highly pure hGR. Our purification scheme is briefly described here. Plasmid-carrying E. coli SG5 cells, which had been grown for ~14 h (A595 = 6.5) in 10 liters of two times concentrated tryptone-yeast extract medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were suspended in lysis buffer (0.1 M Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol) containing 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.05 mg/ml FAD and were lysed by French Press (12000 psi) and sonication. The crude extract was clarified by centrifugation (25,900 × g, 1 h, 4°C). The supernatant was then adjusted to a 20% ammonium sulfate saturation by the addition of solid ammonium sulfate and was stirred for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation (25,900 × g, 1 h, 4°C), and the supernatant was brought to an 80% ammonium sulfate saturation and was stirred for 1 h at 4°C. The precipitate was then obtained by centrifugation (25,900 × g, 1 h, 4°C) and was subsequently resuspended and dialyzed in buffer A (20 mM potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M KCl, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.2). The dialysate was applied to a 50-ml column of 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer A. After extensive washing with buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with 30 ml of 1 mM NADPH in buffer A. The enzyme was reoxidized and stabilized by the addition of 2 mM GSSG. The solution was then dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.5) and applied to a 30-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with buffer B. After washing with 150 ml of buffer B, the enzyme was eluted with a linear salt gradient (0-0.4 M KCl in buffer B). The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer B. The dialyzed protein solution was loaded onto a 10-ml column of Procion Red HE-3B and washed extensively with buffer B. Pure hGR was eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0-2 M KCl in buffer B. Fractions containing hGR were pooled, concentrated to 15 mg/ml, and dialyzed against storage buffer (3% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). The final concentration of the enzyme was assessed using ε463 = 11.3 mM-1 cm-1(22.Krohne-Ehrich G. Schirmer R.H. Untucht-Grau R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was measured under saturating substrate conditions(23.Racker E. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 2: 722-725Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The yields per liter of cell culture were 3-4 mg of electrophoretically homogeneous (>98% pure) hGR, with an A280/A463 ratio of 6.6. The Km for GSSG of 65 μM, and the kcat of 12,500 min-1 agree well with those reported by Nordhoff et al.(21.Nordhoff A. Bücheler U.S. Werner D. Schirmer R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4060-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) for recombinant hGR and by Worthington and Rosemeyer (24.Worthington D.J. Rosemeyer M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) for the native enzyme. Safranin was purchased from Aldrich. XAN was a gift from Terrapin Technologies Inc. (Menlo Park, CA). Chemical structures for both compounds are presented in Fig. 1. All enzyme kinetics experiments were carried out at room temperature (298 K) using Shimadzu(™) (UV160U) and Olis(™) UV-visible spectrophotometers. Enzyme activity was spectrophotometrically monitored from the rate of conversion of NADPH to NADP( (ε340 = 6.2 mM-1 cm-1). For each assay the absorbance of NADPH in the reaction mixture was measured over a period of 1 min. Assays were carried out in 1 ml of the following solution: 0.2 M KCl, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM NADPH, 30-1000 μM GSSG, 0.6 nM hGR, and 35 nM bovine serum albumin. The added bovine serum albumin stabilized hGR, which otherwise rapidly lost activity at the low concentration used in the assay(22.Krohne-Ehrich G. Schirmer R.H. Untucht-Grau R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For the inhibition studies, inhibitors were added to the above mixture at the desired concentrations, whereas all other parameters stayed the same. In the case of XAN, where the inhibitor was dissolved in 0.1 M Tris at pH 8, control assays were performed in the presence of Tris. For each inhibitor we used three different concentrations. The inhibitor concentration was kept constant, and activity measurements were made at 30-1000 μM GSSG. For XAN we have also carried out activity measurements by keeping a saturating 1 mM concentration of GSSG and taking measurements at 5-100 μM NADPH. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH once all other reagents were present in the assay mixture. The inhibition constants, Kis and Kii, for noncompetitive inhibitors were estimated by fitting the data to the following equation using the FORTRAN programs of Cleland(25.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). v=Vmax[S]K m(1+[[I]Kis])+[S](1+[[I]Kii])(Eq. 2) where [S] is the concentration of the variable substrate, [I] is the concentration of the inhibitor, Kis represents the binding of inhibitor to free enzyme, and Kii represents binding to the enzyme-substrate complex. For pure noncompetitive inhibition Kii = Kis, and for pure competitive inhibition Kii = infinity. Crystals of recombinant hGR suitable for crystallographic analysis were reproducibly grown at room temperature using 10-μl hanging drops containing recombinant hGR at 20 mg/ml, 3% ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 0.1%β-octyl glucoside. The drops were equilibrated against a 700-μl reservoir containing 21-23% ammonium sulfate and 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 8. Diffraction quality monoclinic crystals (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.4 mm) of space group C2 and unit cell parameters, a = 119.79 Å, b = 63.35 Å, c = 84.65 Å, α = γ = 90° and β = 58.61°, were grown in 2 days. Although our crystallization conditions are rather different from those used to crystallize natural hGR(26.Thieme R. Pai E.F. Schirmer R.H. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 763-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the crystals are equivalent to those used for the high resolution studies of natural hGR(12.Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), but in order to follow crystallographic conventions we have indexed them in space group C2 rather than B2. Crystals of hGR were stored and handled in artificial mother liquor containing 25% ammonium sulfate in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. To increase the solubility of XAN in the conditions of the artificial mother liquor, the inhibitor was first dissolved in 0.4 M Tris at pH 8 and then used for the soaking experiments. Because aqueous solutions of XAN and safranin are orange-red and dark red, respectively, we observed a marked change in the color of the crystals at the end of soaking experiments involving these two compounds. Crystal soaking conditions for our crystallographic studies are presented in Table 1. All x-ray data were collected on San Diego Multiwire Systems area detectors with a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode (CuKα) and a graphite monochromator. The generator operated at 50 kV/150 mA-1 with a 0.5 × 5-mm focus. Data collection and reduction were carried out as recommended(27.Hamlin R.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 114: 416-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 28.Otwinowski Z. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, 29-30 January 1991, Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). Data collection statistics are shown in Table 1. The structure for recombinant hGR was refined at 2.0 Å resolution by the conventional positional refinement routines in XPLOR(29.Br ü nger A.T. X-PLOR Manual Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The refined structure of the naturally occurring enzyme ((12.Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar); Protein Data Bank entry 3GRS) was used as the starting model after coordinates were altered to comply with our designation of the space group C2. The model for XAN was built using the ChemNote utility of QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and minimized using CHARMm (Molecular Simulations, Inc.). Binding of XAN to the enzyme was observed in difference electron density maps using coefficients (Fo‚soak - Fo‚nat) and calculated phases from the refinement of the native structure (αc‚nat). Initially, data set XAN-1 at 2.3 Å resolution (Table 1) was used. Difference electron density maps showed incomplete density for the tricyclic xanthene moiety of the molecule, but after one round of positional refinement using the native hGR structure after removal of water molecules in the XAN binding site, the density improved. XAN was subsequently fitted, and manual changes to the protein model were made using the program CHAIN(30.Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar). Further cycles of conventional positional refinement against data between 10 and 2.3 Å resolution, and manual fitting yielded a structure with an R-factor of 0.143. At this point data were collected from crystals equilibrated in artificial mother liquor containing XAN and GSSG (data set XAN-2, Table 1). Because binding of GSSG was not observed, data sets XAN-1 and XAN-2 were merged to generate a more complete 2.0 Å resolution data set (Table 1). Several further rounds of manual refitting and positional refinement resulted in our final model of the complex with an R-factor of 0.158 for all data between 10 and 2.0 Å resolution. Kinetic studies showed that XAN inhibition of hGR is noncompetitive with respect to GSSG, with Kis = 27 μM and Kii = 48 μM (see Fig. 2). Additional experiments at saturating concentrations of GSSG and varying concentrations of NADPH revealed that XAN is also noncompetitive to NADPH with is = 144 μM and Kii = 176 μM (data not shown). This mode of inhibition suggests that XAN binds reversibly both to the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex at a site distinct from that of the natural substrate(s). Furthermore, assays done in the absence of GSSG showed that XAN itself does not act as an electron acceptor. The observed noncompetitive inhibition of XAN shows that the diverse compounds identified by the affinity fingerprinting approach to drug design (19.Kauvar L.M. Higgins D.L. Villar H.O. Sportsman R.J. Engqvist-Goldstein Å. Bukar R. Bauer K.E. Dilley H. Rocke D.M. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) may bind to various sites on the enzyme. Given this extra degree of freedom, the predictive success of this study makes it all the more noteworthy. The catalytic mechanism of hGR is a bi-bi ping-pong mechanism with NADPH reacting first to produce the reduced enzyme (EH2), which in turn binds and reduces GSSG(14.Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 15.Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1752-1757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar): E+NADPH⇌E⋅NADPH⇌EH2⋅NADP+⇌EH2(Eq. 3) EH2+GSSG⇌EH2⋅GSSG⇌ESSG⋅GSH⇌E⋅GSH⋅GSH⇌E(Eq. 4) Because there are more than just the E and ES forms of the enzyme present, the Ki values need not be exactly equated with single dissociation constants. Nevertheless, two factors suggest that there is an element of XAN inhibition that is competitive with GSSG. First is the 5-fold poorer inhibition by XAN in the presence of saturating GSSG (Kis = 144 μM) compared with the presence of saturating NADPH (Kis = 27 μM), and second is the 1.8-fold difference in Kiiversus Kis (48 μMversus 27 μM) with respect to GSSG. Both observations suggest that GSSG-bound forms of the enzyme bind to XAN more weakly, which directly implies that XAN bound forms of the enzyme bind GSSG more weakly. After our crystallographic studies (see below) showed that XAN bound in a site known to bind safranin (13.Karplus P.A. Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), we tested the inhibitory effects of safranin. Safranin also behaved as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to GSSG (Fig. 2) but with markedly less potency than XAN, having Kis = 453 μM and Kii = 586 μM with respect to GSSG. To characterize the mode of binding and the inhibition mechanism of XAN and safranin, we have analyzed crystal structures of hGR soaked with XAN alone, GSSG alone, a combination of XAN and GSSG, and a combination of safranin and GSSG (Table 1). XAN binds at the crystallographic 2-fold axis in the large cavity at the dimer interface of hGR with a stoichiometry of one XAN molecule/hGR dimer. The cavity has been previously identified as one that binds safranin and menadione and to a lesser degree lipoate, α-γ-GSSG, and S-(2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione, but whether it has a biological function is still unknown. The cavity connects to both GSSG binding sites through two channels that also serve as mediators between the bulk solvent and the cavity(13.Karplus P.A. Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Structural refinement using the conventional positional refinement routines in X-PLOR yielded our final model for the hGR-XAN complex at 2.0 Å resolution, which has an R-factor = 0.158. Fig. 3A shows the final electron density in the region of the bound XAN inhibitor. The electron density for the xanthene portion of XAN is somewhat irregular, suggesting mobility of XAN at its binding site (Fig. 3B). This is supported by the fact that the B-factors for all atoms in XAN range between 35 and 40 Å2. We have modelled and refined our structure with XAN exhibiting planarity in its xanthene moiety in order to be consistent with the nomenclature and chemical structure of the compound (Fig. 1) and with previously determined crystal structures of compounds that also have a xanthene group(31.DuBost J.P. Leger J.M. Colleter J.C. Levillain P. Fompeydie D. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sér. II. 1981; 292: 965-968Google Scholar, 32.Cody V. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. C. 1987; 43: 705-707Crossref Google Scholar). The region that accommodates XAN in the hGR-XAN complex exhibits high structural disorder with B-factors in the 40-60 Å2 range in the native hGR structure. This effect is particularly pronounced for amino acid residues Phe78 and Met79, for which the possibility that they exist in alternate conformations has been suggested(12.Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 701-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Upon binding of XAN, however, these residues, along with His75 and His82 reorient substantially (Fig. 4A) and become quite rigid with B-factors dropping to near 15 Å2.Figure 4:A, overlay of XAN-free and XAN-bound structures of hGR at the dimer interface. The XAN-bound structure is shown in solid lines. Note the extensive structural changes that take place upon binding of XAN to the free enzyme. The shifts are supported by the strong positive and negative electron density peaks in difference electron density maps (Fo‚soak - Fo‚nat; αc‚nat), as well as by the quality of the final 2Fo‚merge - Fc‚merge; αcȚmerge electron density map (Fig. 3A). Interesting and rather unique is the head-on confrontation of the Cε1 atoms of His82 and His82 with an interatomic distance of 3.1 Å. Despite the pronounced rearrangements in this part of the structure, no significant changes can be observed elsewhere. B, stereo view of the hydrogen bonding interactions at the XAN binding site. The identity of each amino acid residue is indicated by the one-letter amino acid code and the hGR residue number. Hydrogen bonds are represented by thin dashed lines, and the distance between hydrogen bond donor and acceptor pairs is shown (in Å).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) An additional structural change involves Cys90 and Cys90, which form an intersubunit disulfide bridge in the native hGR structure. In the hGR-XAN complex the electron density for the disulfide bridge decreases and elongates (Fig. 3A), indicating increased mobility of this group (along with residues 88-94) and possibly an opening of the disulfide in a fraction of the molecules. In the liganded structure, residues 88-94 have the highest B-factors in the structure and make up the only region whose B-factors are higher in the XAN-bound structure than in the XAN-free state. The observed conformational changes result in a hydrogen bond network involving the inhibitor and neighboring amino acid residues (Fig. 4B). In the native hGR structure, Nδ1 of His75 makes a short (2.6 Å) hydrogen bond with the Nδ1 of His82. In the XAN-bound structure the two residues move apart (Fig. 4A) so that each one can form a hydrogen bond with the oxygen on the carboxylate group of the inhibitor. His82 and His82 make additional hydrogen bonds with the reoriented Cys90 and Cys90, which further supports a partially open conformation for the disulfide bridge between Cys90 and Cys90. His75 is now able to form a new hydrogen bond (2.8 Å) with Tyr407. A hydrogen bond between Tyr407 and Asp81, which is present in unliganded hGR, is maintained in the hGR-XAN complex despite the fact that both these residues have shifted slightly. The tricyclic moiety participates in the hydrogen bonding network through interactions of its oxygens at positions 15 and 16 with Water 358, Asn71 and their symmetry-related partners. Moreover, the central oxygen at position 10 of the xanthene makes a rather long hydrogen bond to Water 435. Nonpolar interactions between hGR and XAN are made primarily by Phe78 and Phe78, which align almost parallel to and about 4 Å away from the plane of the inhibitor's tricycle forming a #x0201C;sandwich” type of interaction (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, the binding site is in a region that is not well conserved between human and yeast GR. Among the residues involved in the binding site (Fig. 4B), none is conserved. Although we still think it is likely that XAN binds at an equivalent site in yeast GR, this need not be so, and even if it does many details of the binding have to be different. In this light we must view the similarity of the inhibition constants of XAN for yeast GR and hGR as fortuitous. To characterize the effects of XAN binding on GSSG binding, hGR crystals were soaked in artificial mother liquor containing both compounds (XAN-2, Table 1). In this soak only XAN was seen to bind, and a control soak with all components of XAN-2 but inhibitor showed that GSSG bound at high occupancy, thus eliminating the possibility that the buffer of the soak hampers binding of GSSG. Interestingly, when we attempted to obtain a double complex containing safranin and GSSG (SAF-1, Table 1), we observed binding of both compounds. The lack of GSSG binding in the XAN-2 soak surprised us because the kinetics had only suggested that XAN was slightly competitive with respect to GSSG (see above). One possible explanation is that under the conditions of the crystalline enzyme (e.g.. high ionic strength), the XAN-hGR interaction changes so that the binding of XAN directly interferes with GSSG binding. However, the results for safranin make this hypothesis less attractive. Another possibility is that the binding of XAN does indeed decrease the binding affinity of GSSG but that this is not visible in the kinetics because of the complexity of the two-substrate hGR reaction(33.Berry A. Scrutton N.S. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1264-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We note in this regard that for similar reasons the aldose reductase inhibitor zopolrestat behaves kinetically as a noncompetitive inhibitor but is crystallographically seen to block the aldose binding site(34.Wilson D.K. Tarle I. Petrash J.M. Quiocho F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9847-9851Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Despite our relatively detailed crystallographic results pertaining to the interactions XAN makes with the enzyme, the inhibition mechanism remains unclear. Based on the observed noncompetitive inhibition, we expected to see structural changes that might affect placement of active site residues or alter the mode of GSSG binding without hindering the affinity of GSSG to the active site. In this way catalysis could be impaired in a manner that could not be overcome by high concentrations of GSSG. In the hGR-XAN complex, XAN is located about 20 Å from the redox-active disulfide of hGR and is about 10 Å from the nearest atom of GSSG in its expected binding mode. This indicates that the observed inhibition is not due to a direct interaction between the inhibitor and the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 5). We note that most residues changing conformation or directly interacting with XAN (His75, Phe78, Met79, Asp81, and His82) reside on the long α-helix that contains the active site disulfide. Despite this fact, no significant movements of atoms in or near the active site disulfide can be observed. The only structural effects that can be seen near the active site are small scale main chain shifts close to the GSSG binding site and in regions that directly interact with GSSG. The most prominent of these is a 0.3-Å shift of Met406 whose main chain nitrogen donates a hydrogen bond to the γ-Glu-II-OT of GSSG in the hGR-GSSG complex (14.Karplus P.A. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Although it would be surprising, it is conceivable that these small conformational changes coupled with the observed decrease in the mobility of the crystalline enzyme could affect binding of GSSG and catalysis. Studies that have been carried out using crystalline ribonuclease A as a model have suggested that enzyme flexibility is required for catalytic function and that a decrease in enzyme flexibility can hamper the activity of the enzyme(35.Rasmussen B.F. Stock A.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Nature. 1992; 357: 423-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Some evidence against this hypothesis is provided by safranin, which also inhibits hGR but does not produce extensive conformational changes either in the hGR-safranin complex (13.Karplus P.A. Pai E.F. Schulz G.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or in our hGR-safranin-GSSG structure. Phe78 and Phe78 are the only residues that are markedly affected by the binding of safranin. An alternative explanation for our results is that the crystallographically seen binding site is a passive one not responsible for inhibition and that the true inhibitory site has not been observed in the crystals. Although this is possible, we think it is unlikely because the XAN binding site is adjacent to the GSSG binding site and is only seen to be highly occupied for compounds that show this type of inhibition. Although we cannot presently detail the mechanism by which XAN and safranin inhibit hGR, we know of no other noncovalent, noncompetitive inhibitors that do not occupy the active site and for which the structural mechanism of inhibition is known. In this light, further investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of these inhibitors should be valuable. We expect that calorimetric analyses, and fast reaction kinetics will shed more light on the inhibition mechanism of XAN and safranin. The residues lining the XAN binding pocket in hGR are not well conserved among homologs of hGR, so although compounds binding at this site are not competitive inhibitors, they are reasonable for structure-based drug design. In this regard, earlier results by Becker et al.(9.Becker K. Christopherson R.I. Cowden W.B. Hunt N.H. Schirmer R.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 39: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and more recent work by Kirsch et al.(36.Kirsch P. Schönleben-Janas A. Schirmer R.H. Liebigs Ann. 1994; 0: 1275-1281Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have focussed on flavin derivatives that are hGR inhibitors and are expected to bind at the same dimer interface cavity that XAN and safranin do. In the case of XAN we see possibilities to rationally improve the potency of the compound. The enzyme-inhibitor interactions are tight in many regions, but there is room to make more extensive interactions through the placement of substituents of appropriate length at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the tricyclic moiety of XAN. Furthermore, a replacement of XAN's carboxylate group with amide or hydroxyl groups might provide more optimal interactions with the surrounding environment, and at the same time it would also test the importance of the negatively charged tail of XAN for inhibition and binding. We thank Dr. Hugo Villar and Terrapin Technologies Inc. for providing XAN, Dr. Dieter Werner for making the recombinant hGR overexpression system available to us, Dr. Emil Pai for recommendations on crystallization conditions, and Dr. Heiner Schirmer for comments on the manuscript. We are also indebted to Dr. Carlos Faerman for initiating our collaboration with Terrapin Technologies Inc. and for helpful discussions and advice and to Dr. Corey Strickland and Dr. Evelyn Jabri for constructive discussions and technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2110329545,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor plays a central role in such phenomena as long term potentiation and excitotoxicity. This importance in defining both function and viability suggests that neurons must carefully control their expression of NMDA receptors. Whereas the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor is ubiquitously transcribed throughout the brain, transcription of NR2 subunits is spatially and temporally controlled. Since heteromeric assembly of both subunits is required for efficient functional expression, post-transcriptional modification of either subunit would affect NMDA receptor activity. Here it is demonstrated that the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of the NR2A subunit severely restricts its protein translation in both Xenopus oocytes and in an in vitro translation system. Mutational analysis of the 5′-UTR implicates secondary structure as the major translational impediment, while the five alternate start codons play minor roles. An important biological role for the 5′-UTR of NR2A is further suggested by the unusually high level of sequence conservation between species. In contrast, the 5′-UTR of NR1 does not inhibit translation and is not conserved. Taken together, these findings suggest a mechanism for modulation of NMDA receptor activity through the control of translational efficiency of a single subunit."

PMA (10 nM) inhibited the incorporation over 90% when added earlier than 3 h after stimulation, but had no effect when added 12 h or later. PMA inhibited the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which normally began at about 9 h.

However, PMA reduced the expression of cyclins E and A, which usually began at 3-9 h and about 15 h, respectively. PMA inhibited the histone H1 kinase activity of Cdk2, which increased from about 9 h, whereas PMA did not inhibit the pRb kinase activities of cyclin D-associated kinase(s) and Cdk4, detectable from 0-3 h.

https://openalex.org/W2092903958,"Thrombin is a multifunctional protein that has both proteinase and growth factor-like activities. Its regulation is largely mediated by interaction with a host of inhibitors including antithrombin III (ATIII), heparin cofactor II (HCII), α2-macroglobulin (α2-M), protease nexin I, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). ATIII, HCII, and α2-M are all abundant in blood and can inactivate blood-borne thrombin leading to rapid hepatic clearance of the thrombin-inhibitor complex. PAI-1 alone, a poor solution phase inhibitor of thrombin, can efficiently inhibit thrombin in the presence of native vitronectin (VN). In this study, active thrombin was found to be efficiently endocytosed and degraded by cultured pre-type II pneumocyte cells, and both processes could be blocked by polyclonal antibodies to PAI-1. When the relative efficiency of cellular endocytosis of thrombin in complex with a number of inhibitors was examined, 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 complexes were most efficiently cleared compared to 125I-thrombin in complex with the serpins ATIII, HCII, α1-proteinase inhibitor, or D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 1 (LRP) and 2 (gp330/megalin) mediate the endocytosis of thrombin-PAI-1, since antagonists of receptor function such as LRP-1 and LRP-2 antibodies and the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein blocked 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 endocytosis and degradation. The LRP-mediated clearance of exogenously added 125I-thrombin by cultured cells was found to be enhanced 5-fold by inclusion of wild-type PAI-1 but by only 2-fold when a mutant form of PAI-1 that is unable to bind VN was included. This wild-type PAI-1 enhancement of 125I-thrombin clearance was found to occur only in the presence of native VN and not with its conformationally altered form. The results highlight a novel mechanism for cellular clearance of thrombin involving native VN promoting the interaction of thrombin and PAI-1 and the subsequent endocytosis of the complex by LRP-1 or LRP-2.

This pathway is potentially important for the regulation of the potent biological activities of thrombin, particularly at sites of vascular injury. The enzymatic activity of thrombin is responsible for the conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin, activation of blood coagulation proteins V, VIII, and XIII(1.Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y.

In addition, thrombin has mitogenic effects on a variety of cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages (4.Chen L.B. Buchanan J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The catalytic activity of thrombin is required for its mitogenic effects on fibroblasts (14.Glenn K.C. Carney D.H. Fenton II, J.H. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol.

In blood, the inhibition of proteolytic active thrombin is mediated by interaction with a host of inhibitors including ATIII, 1The abbreviations used are: ATIIIantithrombin IIIPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1LRPlow density lipoprotein-related receptorRAPreceptor-associated proteinLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorVNvitronectintPAtissue-type plasminogen activatoruPAurokinase plasminogen activatorHCIIheparin cofactor IIα1-PIα1-proteinase inhibitorα2-Mα2-macroglobulinPPACKD-Phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone. HCII, and α2-M. Upon interaction of blood borne thrombin with these inhibitors, the complexes are rapidly cleared by the liver via a receptor-mediated process(17.Fuchs H.E. Shifman M.A. Pizzo S.V.

However, little is known about the mechanism of inactivation and clearance of extravascular thrombin, such as that detected on the surface of tissue macrophage or sequestered within thrombi away from the blood flow and the action of circulating inhibitors(20.Zacharski L.R.

It is likely that in these contexts thrombin exerts its greatest effects on inflammation and vascular wound healing. Given that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to be expressed at sites of inflammation and released from platelet granules upon activation(23.Erickson L.A. Ginsberg M.H. Loskutoff D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1465-1472Google Scholar, 24.Preissner K.T. Holzhuter S. Justus C. Muller-Berghaus G. Blood. 1989; 74: 989-1996Google Scholar), it may under these conditions be a relevant inhibitor of thrombin. While PAI-1 alone is a rather poor inhibitor of thrombin, complex formation with VN has been shown to greatly augment its ability to inhibit thrombin(25.Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M.

While they speculated that the thrombin-PAI-1 interaction might promote plasminogen activator activity by neutralizing PAI-1, this interaction may also mediate cellular clearance of thrombin. The latter would be similar to two other proteinases, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), whose endocytosis and degradation via several members of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family are promoted after complex formation with PAI-1(29.Nykjaer A.

Receptor-specific IgG was selected from the LRP-1 and LRP-2 sera by chromatography on columns of either LRP-1 or LRP-2-Sepharose (1-2 mg of receptor/ml of resin). Control rabbit IgG was purified from non-immune sera. IgG from each preparation was purified by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose and absorbed on a column of RAP-Sepharose (2 mg of RAP/ml of resin). Rabbit anti-murine PAI-1 serum was from Molecular Innovations (Royal Oak, MI). Rat pre-type II pneumocytes (41.Mallampalli R.K. Floerchinger C.S. Hunninghake G.W. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 181-187Google Scholar) were from Dr. R. K. Mallampalli (University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA) and grown in Waymouth's media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin, and streptomycin. Solid phase binding assays were performed as described(34.Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). 125I-Thrombin-PAI-1 complexes (1 nM) in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled complex or RAP were incubated with microtiter wells coated with LRP-1, LRP-2, or bovine serum albumin (3 μg/ml). The program LIGAND (42.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar) was used to analyze the competition data and to determine dissociation constants (Kd) for receptor-ligand interactions. Type II pneumocytes were seeded into wells of 12-well plates (1-2.5 × 105 cells/well) and grown 18 h at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Waymouth's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Before addition of 125I-thrombin-inhibitor complexes, the cells were washed twice in serum-free Waymouth's medium and incubated for 30 min in medium containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, Nutridoma serum substitute, penicillin, and streptomycin (assay medium). 125I-Labeled complexes in assay medium were added to cell layers and incubated for 4-6 h at 37°C. Where indicated, unlabeled thrombin-PAI-1 (800 nM), RAP (1 μM), or IgG (150 μg/ml) was added 30 min prior to addition of 125I-ligand and kept present during the assay. Quantitation of the amount of endocytosed and degraded ligand was done as described in (33.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2369Google Scholar). Briefly, following the incubation period, the medium was removed from the cells and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Soluble radioactivity was taken to represent degraded ligand. Cell layers were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in serum free-medium containing trypsin and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) and 0.5 mM EDTA for 2-5 min at 4°C. The cells were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet was taken to represent the amount of endocytosed ligand. To evaluate the effects of wild-type and mutant PAI-1 on the clearance (endocytosis and degradation) of exogenously added 125I-thrombin, cells were grown in medium containing 10% serum as described above. Washed monolayers were then incubated either with wild-type PAI-1 (10 nM) or mutant PAI-1 (10 nM) for 20 min at 37°C. 125I-Thrombin (10 nM) or 125I-uPA (10 nM) was added and incubated for 4-6 h at 37°C. Where indicated, RAP (1 μM) was incubated for 30 min prior to addition of the ligands. To evaluate the effects of native versus conformationally altered VN on the clearance of exogenously added PAI-1 and active 125I-thrombin, cells were grown in serum-free medium for 18 h at 37°C on tissue culture plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. Medium was removed and assay medium added for 1 h at 37°C to block unoccupied binding sites with bovine serum albumin. Cell monolayers were incubated with either native (50 nM) or conformationally altered VN (50 nM) for 1 h at 37°C. Cell monolayers were then washed twice with assay medium to remove unbound VN. Wild-type PAI-1 (10 nM) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. 125I-Thrombin (10 nM) or 125I-uPA (10 nM) was added and incubated for 4-6 h at 37°C. When the endocytosis and degradation of exogenously added active versus active site-inhibited 125I-thrombin was compared, the active thrombin was more efficiently endocytosed and degraded (Fig. 1). Considering that the clearance of two other proteinases (tPA and uPA) has been shown to be augmented by complex formation with PAI-1(29.Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2369Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that PAI-1 was mediating the clearance of the active thrombin in the cultured pre-type II pneumocyte cells. Pretreatment of cell layers with PAI-1 antibodies resulted in the inhibition of both endocytosis and degradation of active 125I-thrombin, whereas control rabbit IgG had a negligible effect on either process (Fig. 1). These data show that active thrombin is endocytosed and degraded and suggest that PAI-1 is involved. We next investigated the relative efficiency of cell-mediated clearance of 125I-thrombin in complex with various serpins using the pre-type II pneumocyte cell line. As shown in Fig. 2, 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 complexes were endocytosed (panel A) and degraded (panel B) at levels 6-fold greater (n = 2) than complexes of thrombin and the serpins ATIII, HCII, and α1-PI or of thrombin and the synthetic peptide inhibitor PPACK. Considering that PAI-1 facilitates the cellular clearance of active uPA(43.Cubellis M.V. Wun T.C. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1079-1085Google Scholar, 44.Jensen P.H. Christensen E.I. Ebbesen P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 26550-26555Google Scholar), the potential role of these receptors in the clearance of thrombin-PAI-1 was studied. The pre-type II pneumocyte cell line has been shown previously to express two members of the LDLR family, LRP-1 and LRP-2(33.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2369Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, antagonists of LRP-1 and LRP-2 function, namely the 39-kDa RAP, and antibodies to either LRP-1 or LRP-2 each inhibited the endocytosis and degradation of 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 complex. The extent of RAP inhibition was similar to that using excess unlabeled thrombin-PAI complex, suggesting that members of the LDLR family were mediating the endocytosis and degradation of thrombin-PAI. While both LRP antibodies blocked 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 endocytosis and degradation, LRP-1 antibodies were more effective than LRP-2 antibodies. This differential effect most likely reflects higher levels of LRP-1 expression by type II pneumocytes(33.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2369Google Scholar). The results indicate that at least two members of the LDLR family, LRP-1 and LRP-2 can mediate endocytosis and degradation of 125I-thrombin-PAI-1. The inability of the combination of both LRP antibodies to inhibit endocytosis and degradation to the same extent as did RAP (Fig. 3) may indicate that other LDLR family members are expressed by the pre-type II pneumocyte cells that are able to endocytose thrombin-PAI-1. Solid phase binding assays using purified components were performed to determine whether thrombin-PAI-1 was able to bind directly to LRP-1 and LRP-2. As shown in Fig. 4, 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 complex bound to microtiter wells coated with either receptor. By fitting the homologous ligand displacement data to a model of a single class of sites, dissociation constants (Kd) of 3.3 nM (n = 3) and 13 nM (n = 2) were derived for the binding of 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 to LRP-1 and LRP-2, respectively. RAP was found to compete for the binding of 125I-labeled complex to both receptors (Fig. 4). Thrombin or PAI-1 alone did not compete efficiently for 125I-thrombin-PAI-1 binding to either receptor (Ki > 700 nM). The results indicate that thrombin-PAI-1 complex binds with high affinity to LRP-1 and LRP-2. The fact that PAI-1 is known to bind to both receptors(33.Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2361-2369Google Scholar, 47.Nykjaer A. Kjoller L. Cohen R. Lawrence D.A. Garni-Wagner B.-A. Todd R.F. van Zonneveld A.-J. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25668-25676Google Scholar), yet is unable to compete for thrombin-PAI-1 binding, may indicate that the complex possesses an additional receptor binding site not present on either thrombin or PAI-1 alone. Considering that VN has been shown to promote the inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1(25.Ehrlich H.J. Gebbink R.K. Keijer J. Linders M. Preissner K.T. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13029-13035Google Scholar, 26.Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar), we were interested to determine whether such a mechanism was involved in the pre-type II pneumocyte cell clearance of thrombin. Pre-type II pneumocyte cell layers that had been grown in serum-containing medium were incubated with either wild-type PAI-1 or a mutant PAI-1, which is unable to bind VN but is identical to wild-type PAI-1 in its ability to bind heparin or to inhibit uPA(37.Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5(panels A and C), inclusion of wild-type PAI-1 produced a greater level of endocytosis and degradation of 125I-thrombin compared to mutant PAI-1. In contrast, the endocytosis of 125I-uPA was enhanced to the same degree by either wild-type or mutant PAI-1 (Fig. 5, panels B and D). RAP treatment blocked the wild-type PAI-1-promoted endocytosis of both thrombin and uPA. The results suggest that PAI-1 binding to VN derived from serum is important for the clearance of thrombin. We speculate that the clearance of free thrombin requires complex formation with PAI-1, a process that is known to be greatly accelerated by VN. The low level of thrombin clearance promoted by mutant PAI-1 was likely due its ability to form a complex with thrombin, albeit inefficiently, in the absence of VN. Given that heparin has also been shown to stimulate complex formation although less efficiently than VN(48.Gebbink R.K. Reynolds C.H. Tollefsen D.M. Mertens K. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1675-1680Google Scholar), it is possible that proteoglycans present in the cell culture acted to accelerate complex formation in lieu of VN. Since PAI-1 binds uPA with high affinity and without a requirement for VN, its clearance (Fig. 5, panels B and D) was, as expected, not dependent on the ability of PAI-1 to complex with VN. To show that the PAI-1 mutation did not affect the ability of its complex with thrombin to bind to LRPs, complexes of 125I-thrombin with either wild-type PAI-1 or mutant PAI-1 were formed in vitro. As shown in Fig. 6, complexes containing either form of PAI-1 were readily endocytosed (panel A) and degraded (panel B) by the pre-type II pneumocyte cells. Both the endocytosis and degradation of the complexes were inhibited by including RAP in the assay. These results indicate that complexes of thrombin and either wild-type or mutant PAI-1 are recognized equally well by LRP receptors. Therefore, when free 125I-thrombin was presented to the cells as in Fig. 5, the formation of a complex with PAI-1•VN was required for the efficient complex formation between thrombin and PAI-1, which leads to rapid LRP-mediated endocytosis and degradation. It has been established previously that native VN accelerates the formation of the thrombin-PAI-1 complex, whereas conformationally altered VN does not (26.Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). To determine whether the conformational state of VN influenced PAI-1-mediated cellular clearance of thrombin, we examined the clearance of 125I-thrombin in the presence of PAI-1 and either native or conformationally altered VN. As shown in Fig. 7(panels A and C), using cells grown in the absence of serum to eliminate exposure to serum VN, exogenously added native VN enhanced 125I-thrombin clearance. Conformationally altered VN was no more effective in promoting the clearance of 125I-thrombin than was PAI-1 alone. Given that glycosaminoglycans have been shown to promote inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1(48.Gebbink R.K. Reynolds C.H. Tollefsen D.M. Mertens K. Pannekoek H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1675-1680Google Scholar), proteoglycans may have contributed the low level of thrombin clearance observed with PAI-1 alone or PAI-1 plus conformationally altered VN. By comparison, 125I-uPA clearance mediated by complex formation with PAI-1 was not influenced by the presence or absence of native or conformationally altered VN (Fig. 7, panels B and D). In this study we have shown that: 1) exogenously administered active thrombin is endocytosed and degraded by cultured cells; 2) inactivation of the thrombin with PPACK or inclusion of polyclonal antibodies to PAI-1 blocked both processes; 3) thrombin in complex with PAI-1 was more efficiently cleared than when it was in complex with antithrombin, HCII, or α1-antiproteinase; 4) RAP, the antagonist of ligand binding to members of the LDLR family, blocked the endocytosis and degradation of thrombin; 5) both LRP-1 and LRP-2 bound to thrombin-PAI-1 complexes with high affinity in solid phase assays and receptor antibodies blocked cellular clearance of the complex; 6) wild-type PAI-1 but not a mutant form of PAI-1 that is unable to bind VN facilitated the cellular clearance of thrombin; and 7) native but not denatured VN augments the PAI-1-promoted clearance of thrombin. Based on these findings, we conclude that active thrombin clearance by pre-type II pneumocyte cells can be mediated through its complex formation with PAI-1 and the subsequent interaction of the complex with either LRP-1 or LRP-2. The role of native VN in this process is critical, presumably due to the fact that it acts to augment the formation of the thrombin-PAI-1 complex, which is otherwise an inefficient process. VN is known to bind both PAI-1 and thrombin(26.Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar, 49.Podack E.R. Dahlback B. Griffin J.H.

FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 125-128Google Scholar). The consequences of these binding interactions apparently leads to more efficient interaction between PAI-1 and thrombin. It is not known whether VN remains associated with PAI-1 and thrombin following their interaction. VN does form a ternary complex with thrombin bound to either ATIII HCII, proteinase nexin I, or α1-PI-Pittsburgh(53.Ill C.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15610-15615Google Scholar, 54.Rovelli G. Stone S.R. Preissner K.T. Monard D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 797-803Google Scholar, 55.Tomasini B.R. Owen M.C. Fenton II, J.W. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7617-7623Google Scholar). However, the complex of PA1-1 and VN dissociates following the interaction with either uPA or tPA (56.Salonen E.M. Vaheri A. Pollanen J. Stephens R. Andreasen P. Mayer M. Dano K. Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6339-6343Google Scholar). In our experiments we did not evaluate whether VN was endocytosed along with thrombin-PAI-1 complex. In studies reported by Panetti and McKeown-Longo(57.Panetti T.S. McKeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11988-11993Google Scholar), active thrombin but not inactivated thrombin was shown to promote the cellular clearance of 125I-native VN. Since inactive thrombin is not able to bind serine proteinase inhibitors whereas active thrombin can, the authors speculated that thrombin interaction with some endogenous inhibitor facilitated native VN clearance. This is consistent with our findings showing that active thrombin is cleared much more efficiently than is inactivated thrombin and that PAI-1 antibodies inhibit the clearance of active thrombin. The results taken together point to the possibility that a ternary complex of thrombin-PAI-1 and VN may be cleared, but this remains to be established. The fact that RAP blocks thrombin clearance to the same extent as excess unlabeled thrombin indicates that LRP receptors are primarily responsible for mediating the clearance process. A major concept to emerge from this work is that PAI-1 can serve to mediate thrombin catabolism, but it raises the issue of when and where such a process might occur in vivo. While PAI-1 inhibits uPA and tPA with a second-order rate constant of 107M⁻1 s⁻1(58.Lawrence D.A. Strandberg L. Grundstrom T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar), by comparison the second-order rate constant for inhibition of thrombin is ~10,000-fold less(26.Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of PAI-1 inhibition of thrombin therefore may not be immediately obvious, until one considers that cofactors such as heparin and VN can dramatically enhance the ability of PAI-1 to inhibit thrombin. For example, in the presence of VN the second-order rate constant for the inhibition of thrombin by PAI-1 is increased by more than 2 orders of magnitude(26.Naski M.C. Lawrence D.A. Mosher D.F. Podor T.J. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12367-12372Google Scholar). This effect makes PAI-1•VN a 10-20-fold better inhibitor of thrombin than ATIII in the absence of heparin. In blood, where the concentration of ATIII is 10,000-fold higher than PAI-1, the relevance of PAI-1 as an inhibitor of blood borne thrombin is unlikely. However, in extravascular sites such as in the recesses of a fibrin-containing thrombus, we speculate that it may be a physiologically relevant inhibitor of thrombin. Fibrin is thought to sequester thrombin, protecting it from circulating inhibitors (22.Weitz J. Hudoba M. Massel D. Maragonore J. Hirsh J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 385-391Google Scholar, 59.Liu C.Y. Nossel H.L. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Google Scholar, 60.Fenton II, J.W. Olson T.A. Zabinski M.P. Wilner G.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7106-7112Google Scholar) until lysis of the clot by plasmin(59.Liu C.Y. Nossel H.L. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Google Scholar). The thrombin thereby released would be available to drive post-clotting events such as mediating mitogenesis and chemotaxis of cells involved in clot remodeling and tissue repair. PAI-1, either derived from platelets or synthesized by cells invading a clot or on the boundaries of the clot, and VN, derived either from platelets (24.Preissner K.T. Holzhuter S. Justus C. Muller-Berghaus G. Blood. 1989; 74: 989-1996Google Scholar) or blood, could mediate inactivation of thrombin and its clearance by LRP-expressing cells (e.g. smooth muscle cells, macrophage, and fibroblasts). In this way the post-clotting effects of thrombin could be negatively regulated."

Receptor binding activity was tested by competition of 125I-IL-8 binding to recombinant IL8R1 and IL8R2 cell lines. Substitution into IL-8 of the GROγ sequences corresponding to either the amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) or the first β-sheet (amino acids 18-32) reduced binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The third β-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 46-53) was required for binding to IL8R1 but not IL8R2. Exchanges of the second β-sheet (amino acids 32-46) or the carboxyl-terminal α-helix (amino acids 53-72) had no significant effect. When IL-8 sequences were substituted into GROγ, a single domain containing the second β-sheet of IL-8 (amino acids 18-32) was sufficient to confer high affinity binding for both IL8R1 and IL8R2. The amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) and the third β-sheet (amino acids 46-53) of IL-8 had little effect when substituted individually but showed increased binding to both receptors when substituted in combination.Individual amino acid substitutions were made at positions where IL-8 and GROγ sequences differ within the regions of residues 11-21 and 46-53. IL-8 mutations L49A or L49F selectively inhibited binding to IL8R1. Mutations Y13L and F21N enhanced binding to IL8R1 with little effect on IL8R2. A combined mutation Y13L/S14Q selectively decreased binding to IL8R2. Residues Tyr13, Ser14, Phe21, and Lys49 are clustered in and around a surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 that is physically distant from the previously identified ELR binding sequence. A homology model of GROγ, constructed from the known structure of IL-8 by refinement calculations, indicated that access to the hydrophobic pocket was effectively abolished in GROγ. These studies suggest that the surface hydrophobic pocket and/or adjacent residues participate in IL-8 receptor recognition for both IL8R1 and IL8R2 and that the hydrophobic pocket itself may be essential for IL8R1 binding. Thus this region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and IL8R1 specificity. To determine the regions of interleukin-8 (IL-8) that allow high affinity and interleukin-8 receptor type 1 (IL8R1)-specific binding of chemokines, we produced chimeric proteins containing structural domains from IL-8, which binds to both IL8R1 and interleukin-8 receptor type 2 (IL8R2) with high affinity, and from GROγ, which does not bind to IL8R1 and binds to IL8R2 with reduced affinity.

A homology model of GROγ, constructed from the known structure of IL-8 by refinement calculations, indicated that access to the hydrophobic pocket was effectively abolished in GROγ. These studies suggest that the surface hydrophobic pocket and/or adjacent residues participate in IL-8 receptor recognition for both IL8R1 and IL8R2 and that the hydrophobic pocket itself may be essential for IL8R1 binding. Thus this region contains a second site for IL-8 receptor recognition that, in combination with the Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 region, can modulate receptor binding affinity and IL8R1 specificity.

These proteins contain four conserved cysteine residues with a single intervening amino acid between the first two cysteine residues and are designated the C-X-C chemokines. IL-8 mediates the recruitment and activation of neutrophils during inflammation and has been implicated in multiple pathologic conditions involving chronic and acute inflammation and in neutrophil-mediated injury(4.Endo H.

Two receptors for IL-8 have been identified by molecular cloning and account for the observed effects of IL-8 and other C-X-C chemokines on neutrophils(12.Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.-J. Rice G.C.

Although both are seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptors, Type 1 and Type 2 IL-8 receptors differ in ligand specificity. The Type 1 receptors (IL8R1) have restricted specificity and bind IL-8 exclusively with high affinity(14.Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar, 15.Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. VandenBos T. Nelson N. Gearing D.P. Beckmann M.P. Mol. Immunol. 1993; 30: 359-367Google Scholar). In contrast, the Type 2 receptors (IL8R2) bind IL-8 with a similarly high affinity but also recognize several other C-X-C chemokines with varying affinities(14.Lee J. Horuk R. Rice G.C. Bennett G.L. Camerato T. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16283-16287Google Scholar, 15.Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. VandenBos T. Nelson N. Gearing D.P. Beckmann M.P. Mol.

Structures for both the crystal and solution forms of IL-8 have been determined(16.Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J-C. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Edwards B.F.P. Clore G.M.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Google Scholar). IL-8 comprises five discrete structural domains: an amino-terminal loop, three antiparallel β-sheets, and a carboxyl-terminal α-helix. The highest regions of amino acid homology among the C-X-C chemokines occur at the conserved cysteine residues and at other key structural residues, suggesting that the basic structural elements of IL-8 are conserved among family members (1.Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O.C. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Google Scholar, 2.Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Google Scholar, 3.Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 12: 17-46Google Scholar). The solution structure for GROα (18.Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T.J. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Google Scholar) and crystal structure for neutrophil-activating peptide-2 (19.Malkowski M.G. Wu J.Y. Lazar J.B. Johnson P.H. Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7077-7087Google Scholar) show similar organization. Several studies have addressed the structure-activity relationships required for C-X-C chemokine binding to neutrophils. A conserved sequence that is essential for binding, Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 (ELR), was identified by scanning mutagenesis of IL-8 (20.Hébert C.A. Vitangcol R.V. Baker J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18989-18994Google Scholar) and by amino-terminal truncated analogs(21.Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Google Scholar). The exclusive binding of IL-8 to IL8R1 and the different affinities among C-X-C chemokines for binding to IL8R2 suggest that a second site on IL-8 determines receptor specificity. Hybrid proteins derived from IL-8 and IP10, a C-X-C chemokine that lacks the ELR sequence and that does not bind neutrophil IL-8 receptors, indicated that the ELR sequence as well as IL-8 sequences for amino acids 10-22 and 30-34 are required for neutrophil recognition(22.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Google Scholar). Chimeric analysis of IL-8 with the murine chemokine N51/KC indicated a site that enhances binding to neutrophils is within amino acids 13-29(23.Heinrich J.N. O'Rourke E.C. Chen L. Gray H. Dorfman K.S. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2849-2861Google Scholar). Receptor specificity was addressed directly on recombinant IL-8 receptors with chimeric proteins derived from IL-8 and GROα or rabbit IL-8 and demonstrated that IL8R1 specificity element(s) reside between Cys7 and Cys50 of IL-8(24.Schraufstatter I.U. Barritt D.S. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6418-6428Google Scholar). In this study we have generated chimeric proteins containing domains from IL-8 and GROγ and report that the second site for receptor binding and specificity is localized in the region of a unique hydrophobic surface pocket on IL-8. Through amino acid replacement studies we have identified residues in and around the hydrophobic pocket that influence binding of IL-8 to IL8R1 and IL8R2. Recombinant human IL-8, GROα (GRO/MGSA), and 125I-IL-8 were prepared as described(25.Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433Google Scholar). Recombinant human GROβ (MIP2α) and GROγ (MIP2β) were produced in yeast and purified by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-100 HR. Corresponding domains of IL-8 and GROγ were identified by protein sequence alignments shown in Fig. 1. DNA encoding chimeric IL-8/GROγ were generated by recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (26.Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sminsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) and/or by ligation with synthetic oligonucleotides encoding the desired amino acid as depicted in Fig. 2. A synthetic IL-8 gene, il8syn(27.Miller E.J. Cohen A.B. Carr F.K. Hayashi S. Chiu C.Y. Lee-Ng C.T. Mullenbach G. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 357-362Google Scholar), and a MIP2β cDNA clone, MIP540(28.Tekamp-Olson P. Gallegos C. Bauer D. McClain J. Sherry B. Fabre M. van Deventer S. Cerami A. J. Exp.

For G18I, sequences between the Asp718 and MluI restriction sites were generated with oligonucleotides accX, Xmlu, Xacc, and mluX. For I18G, sequences between Asp718 and BglII were from oligonucleotides accZ, Zbgl, Zacc, and bglZ. Chimeric DNA were used as PCR templates in some cases: G32I and I46G for G32I46G, I32G and G46I for I32G46I, and G46I53G for I18G46I53G. Constructs were ligated, as Asp718/SalI fragments a transfer vector containing the GAP promoter fused to the α-factor leader (29.Brake A.

Ames G.F.-L. Methods in Molecular Biology. 1993; 15: 339-348Google Scholar) with the exception that vent polymerase was used in the place of Taq polymerase. The DNA template was either the native IL-8 or il8syn(27.Miller E.J. Cohen A.B. Carr F.K. Hayashi S. Chiu C.Y. Lee-Ng C.T. Mullenbach G. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 357-362Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were introduced by overlap PCR using the sense and antisense mutated primers in combination with appropriate end primers as listed in Table 2(31.Shyamala V. Ames G.F.-L. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 1-6Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified fragment was digested with Asp718/XhoI and ligated into the transfer vector.Tabled 1 Expression cassettes for yeast secretion were transferred as BamHI restriction fragments into vector pAB24 (29.Brake A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 408-421Google Scholar) and introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain MB2-1 by electroporation. Chimeric and mutant chemokines were purified from 50-200 ml of yeast culture broth by batch adsorption on S-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) after adjustment to pH 5.5 with 50 mM sodium acetate and eluted in 20 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, 1 M NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2-2 mg/ml. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 18% Tris/glycine gels (Novex) indicated 80-95% purity. Protein concentrations were estimated by Coomassie-stained polyacrylamide gels and by BCA (Pierce) protein assays. Amino acid composition and amino-terminal sequencing were performed on selected proteins and agreed with predicted protein sequences. Competitive binding assays for the chimeric proteins were performed on CHO-IL8R1 and CHO-IL8R2 cells essentially as described(25.Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate and data were analyzed by GraFit(32.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit. Erithacus Software, Ltd., Staines, UK1991Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate on freshly isolated human neutrophils as described(25.Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433Google Scholar). Chemotaxis to f-Met-Leu-Phe (100 nM) was measured as a positive control for each experiment. A homology-based model of GROγ was built based on the NMR solution-derived structure of IL-8(17.Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Google Scholar). The LOOK software program (Molecular Applications Group, Mountain View, CA) was used to align the GROγ and IL-8 sequences(33.Needleman S.B. Wunsch C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 48: 443-453Google Scholar). Then a three-dimensional model of GROγ was built by Levitt's automatic segment matching (34.Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Google Scholar) and further refined by restrained energy minimization and molecular dynamics(35.Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 723-764Google Scholar). Chimeric IL-8/GROγ proteins were designed to test the contribution of each structural domain of IL-8 for binding to IL8R1 and IL8R2. Four conserved amino acid residues were identified as structural domain boundaries for IL-8: His18, Pro32, Gly46, and Pro53 (Fig. 1). To maintain the overall C-X-C chemokine structure, sequences for complete structural domains between these boundaries were interchanged between IL-8 and GROγ (Fig. 2). The corresponding chimeric chemokines were produced in yeast using the α-factor mating pheromone secretion pathway (29.Brake A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 408-421Google Scholar) and purified to near homogeneity by a single step enrichment/purification protocol. With the exception of I32G, all proteins were expressed and recovered in yields sufficient for testing. Truncated variant proteins were observed for several of the mutants in which the amino-terminal sequences of GROγ were fused with carboxyl-terminal portions of IL-8 and varied from 20 to 80% of the total chimera protein. Only the predicted amino-terminal protein sequence was detected in these samples. The carboxyl-terminal sequence of IL-8 reveals a Lys-Arg motif at residues 67 and 68 (Fig. 1). This sequence is a substrate site for the yeast dibasic protease KEX2(36.Fuller R.S. Brake A. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1434-1438Google Scholar), and cleavage at this position can account for the observed reduction of approximately 5000 molecular mass units. Although previous studies have suggested that the α-helix region is not essential for IL-8 recognition by neutrophil receptors(21.Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Google Scholar), the utilization of a previously silent KEX2 yeast-processing site suggests an increase in the accessibility of this region to protease attack and may indicate aberrant folding for this series of chimeric proteins. Receptor binding activity of chimeric proteins was measured by competition of 125I-IL-8 binding to recombinant IL8R1 and IL8R2 cell lines. GROγ did not bind to IL8R1 and was 15-fold less potent than IL-8 for binding to IL8R2 (Table 3). IL-8 or GROγ purified in small scale by the procedure used for chimeric proteins had the same potency as that purified in large scale by multiple chromatography (data not shown). For IL-8/GROγ chimeras, substitution of GROγ sequences onto the amino terminus of IL-8 (amino acids 1-18 or more) resulted in a loss of affinity to both IL8R1 and IL8R2 (Table 3). Chimeric chemokines G32I, G46I, and G53I were even less potent than GROγ, which may reflect improper folding since these proteins were prone to truncation as described above. In substitutions at the carboxyl terminus, replacement of the α-helix residues 53-72 of IL-8 with the corresponding region of GROγ had no significant effect on receptor binding activity (Table 3, I53G). In contrast, substitution of residues 46-72 of IL-8 with the corresponding GROγ sequence selectively reduced binding to IL8R1 but not IL8R2 (Table 3, I46G), suggesting that residue(s) within the third β-sheet (amino acids 46-53) are involved in specific binding to IL8R1 and not IL8R2.Tabled 1 Chimeric proteins with single domains of GROγ substituted into IL-8 were used to test the role of each β-sheet region. Replacement of amino acids 18-32, corresponding to the first β-sheet, reduced binding of IL-8 to both IL8R1 and IL8R2 (Fig. 3, I18G32I). Exchange of regions within amino acids 32-46 was not important for binding to either IL8R1 or IL8R2 (Fig. 3, I32G46I). Substitution for amino acids 46-53 reduced binding to IL8R1 by 10-fold without affecting binding to IL8R2 (Fig. 3, I46G53I), confirming that the third β-sheet of IL-8 participates in IL8R1 specificity. In the reciprocal experiment, individual domains of IL-8 were substituted into GROγ to examine whether any of these regions could enhance binding to IL-8 receptors. Replacement of residues 18-32, corresponding to the first β-sheet of IL-8, was sufficient to allow nearly IL-8-like activity on both IL8R1 and IL8R2 (Fig. 5, G18I32G). Two domains, corresponding to amino acids 1-18 and 32-46, slightly enhanced binding to IL8R1 (Fig. 3, I18G and G32I46G). Since the amino-terminal loop and the third β-sheet were both important for IL8R1 binding of IL-8 but had little effect when substituted into GROγ individually, a chimera was generated to test whether simultaneous replacement of these regions of GROγ with corresponding IL-8 sequences could confer IL-8-like activity. The combined substitution of amino acids 1-18 and 46-53 allowed high affinity binding of GROγ to both IL8R1 and IL8R2 (Fig. 3, I18G46I53G). Since the replacement of IL-8 amino acids 46-53 with GROγ reduced binding to IL8R1 without affecting the binding to IL8R2, the role of individual amino acids in this region was examined through point mutations to substitute GROγ residues into IL-8. Four amino acid residues differ between IL-8 and GROγ in this region: Arg47, Glu48, Leu49, and Asp52. The GROγ amino acids were introduced into IL-8 to test each residue individually and in combinations. The mutation of IL-8 L49A, alone or in combination, selectively decreased the binding to IL8R1 (Table 4). Neither the E48K replacement nor the conservative substitution D52N affected binding to either receptor, although the double mutation of E48K/D52N decreased binding to IL8R1 by 3-fold. R47K marginally decreased the binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2 but had no impact on receptor binding in combination mutations. The triple mutation R47K/E48K/D52N also had little effect on binding to either receptor and no selectivity for IL8R1. No protein was expressed for IL-8 mutations R47K/E48K and E48K/L49A/D52N, suggesting abnormal folding and protein degradation. IL-8 R47K/L49A did not generate yeast transformants, implying intolerance of the mutated protein by this host cell. Consistent with the chimeric substitutions in the 46-53 region, substituting Leu49 decreased the binding to IL8R1 with no significant effect on binding to IL8R2. These data indicate that Leu49 is the primary determinant within the third β-sheet for IL8R1 specificity of IL-8.Tabled 1 The chimera data demonstrated that IL-8 amino acids 1-18 of the amino-terminal loop are important for binding of IL-8 to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. Within this region there are several amino acid differences; particularly, the five amino acids of IL-8 at positions 13-17 are replaced by only four different residues in GROγ. IL-8 amino acids 13-15 were substituted with comparable amino acids of GROγ. No protein was expressed for mutants containing the K15G mutation alone or in combinations, suggesting that this alteration of the chemokine structure is not tolerated. The mutation Y13L increased the binding to IL8R1 over 3-fold without affecting IL8R2 binding (Table 4). S14Q marginally decreased the binding to IL8R1, but the double mutation of Y13L/S14Q significantly decreased the binding to IL8R2 over 4-fold with little effect on IL8R1 (Table 4). These results are consistent with the amino acid 1-18 chimeric substitutions and demonstrate that Tyr13 and Ser14 contribute to the specificity of IL-8 binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. Based upon the established structure of IL-8(16.Baldwin E.T. Weber I.T. St. Charles R. Xuan J-C. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Edwards B.F.P. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Wlodawer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 502-506Google Scholar, 17.Clore G.M. Appella E. Yamada M. Matsushima K. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1689-1696Google Scholar), residues Tyr13, Ser14, and Leu49 lie on a single face of the IL-8 molecule in a region that is unique and distant from both the conserved ELR residues previously identified as essential for IL-8 binding to IL-8 receptors and the strand of hydrophobic residues that participates in the monomer-monomer interface of the dimer form of IL-8 (Fig. 4). These residues coincide with or are adjacent to a surface-exposed hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 that consists of Tyr13, Phe17, Ile22, Val41, Leu43 Leu49, and Leu51 (Fig. 4). This slot-like hydrophobic pocket is large enough to accommodate a phenyl ring, which fits into the pocket as a coin in a slot. The entrance to this pocket is flanked by Tyr13, Lys15, Phe21, and Arg47. A homology-based model of GROγ was constructed to compare the relative positions of the corresponding residues. The predicted structure is shown in the same relative orientation as the structure of IL-8 (Fig. 4). In IL-8, one side of the hydrophobic pocket is formed by the Tyr13-Ile22 strand. In GROγ, little of this stretch of residues is conserved, and there is a deletion of one residue. Tyr13 and Phe17 are conservatively substituted with isoleucine in GROγ, and Ile22 is conserved. Thus, the residues contributing to the hydrophobic core appear to be conserved. However, the deletion corresponding to Lys15 in IL-8 reduces the length of the Tyr13-Ile22 strand, effectively shrinking the hydrophobic pocket in GROγ. The substitution of Pro19 by a leucine in GROγ affects the structure of this strand and its contribution to the hydrophobic pocket. According to our homology model, the hydrophobic pocket in GROγ is much smaller than that in IL-8 and cannot accommodate a phenyl ring. In addition, none of the gateway residues of IL-8 are conserved in GROγ. Additional point mutations of IL-8 were designed to test the role of the key hydrophobic pocket and flanking residues in the recognition of IL-8 by IL8R1 and IL8R2. Mutations were introduced at positions Phe21, Val41, Asp45, and Leu49, corresponding to residues that are unique in IL-8. F21N increased the binding affinity by 5.5- and 2.4- fold to IL8R1 and IL8R2, respectively (Fig. 5). Mutation D45R had no effect on IL8R1 and IL8R2 binding, indicating that this charged residue is not critical for binding. The mutation V41F, which introduces a more bulky hydrophobic group within the pocket, also had little effect on either receptor. Three additional mutants, F21T, V41R, and V41K, did not express the recombinant protein. At Leu49, insertion of the aromatic residue in L49F selectively decreased binding to IL8R1 by 6.2-fold with no significant effect on IL8R2. In contrast the relatively conservative substitution of L49S had little effect on IL-8 receptor activity. Taken together with the observations for L49A and for Y13L, these mutations reveal that key residues for determining receptor-specific binding of IL-8 are clustered around the surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket and suggest that increased access to the pocket by removal of the aromatic residues at Tyr13 and Phe21 can enhance binding to IL8R1. The functional activation of IL-8 receptors was assessed in neutrophil chemotaxis assays. GROγ was less potent than IL-8 and had lower efficacy at optimal chemotaxis concentrations (Fig. 6). Chimeric IL-8/GROγ proteins demonstrated neutrophil chemotactic activity consistent with relative receptor binding activity (Fig. 6 and additional data not shown). Proteins with characteristic binding properties of GROγ, i.e. an absence of binding to IL8R1 and a reduced affinity binding to IL8R2, displayed GROγ-like chemotactic activity. An IL-8-like chemotactic efficacy correlated with recognition by IL8R1, and the relative potency paralleled the affinity for IL8R1 observed in competitive binding assays (Fig. 6). IL-8 variants with point mutations also stimulated chemotaxis with the same efficacy as IL-8 at optimal doses but displayed variable chemotactic potency. Y13L, which showed increased binding to IL8R1, was 2-3-fold more potent than IL-8 in chemotaxis assays (data not shown). L49F had a reduced chemotactic potency proportionate to reduced activity for IL8R1. However, L49A had only slightly reduced chemotactic activity despite a significantly decreased ability to bind to IL8R1 (data not shown). The Y13L/S14Q mutation decreased binding specifically to IL8R2 but had no effect on chemotaxis, consistent with the major role of IL8R1 in chemotaxis(25.Hammond M.E.W. Lapointe G.R. Feucht P.H. Hilt S. Gallegos C.A. Gordon C.A. Giedlin M.A. Mullenbach G. Tekamp-Olson P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1428-1433Google Scholar). The functional activity of mutant proteins was further analyzed by intracellular signaling assays. Wu et al.(37.Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Google Scholar) have demonstrated that IL-8 receptors signal via Gαi subunits. Therefore, the ability of IL8R1 and IL8R2 to reduce cAMP concentrations was determined in CHO cells as described in Shyamala et al.(38.Shyamala V. Moulthrop T.H.M. Stratton-Thomas J. Tekamp-Olson P. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 285-296Google Scholar). IL-8 inhibited the forskolin-induced elevation of cAMP levels in either CHO-IL8R1 or CHO-IL8R2 cells (data not shown). The 11 mutated IL-8 proteins also inhibited cAMP levels upon interaction with either IL8R1 or IL8R2 to varying degrees (data not shown), confirming that these proteins are functional agonists of IL8R1 and IL8R2. By construction of IL-8/GROγ chimeras we have demonstrated that the amino-terminal loop (amino acids 1-18) and the first β-sheet (amino acids 18-32) of IL-8 contain residue(s) that are essential for high affinity, IL-8-like binding to both IL8R1 and IL8R2. These domains encompass the regions identified by IL-8/IP10 hybrids (22.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Google Scholar) and by IL-8/N51 chimeric proteins (23.Heinrich J.N. O'Rourke E.C. Chen L. Gray H. Dorfman K.S. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2849-2861Google Scholar) as necessary for maximal binding to neutrophils. The third β-sheet of IL-8 contains residue(s) that confer IL8R1-specific binding and are not required for binding to IL8R2. Complete analysis of this region by point mutations indicated that L49A substitution is responsible for the specific reduction of IL8R1 binding. Heinrich et al. (23.Heinrich J.N. O'Rourke E.C. Chen L. Gray H. Dorfman K.S. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2849-2861Google Scholar) observed that a chimeric IL-8/N51 protein containing this substitution (corresponding to I34N50I) exhibited neutrophil binding properties similar to IL-8. That result may reflect the participation of both IL8R1 and IL8R2 receptors in neutrophil binding. Schraufstatter et al.(24.Schraufstatter I.U. Barritt D.S. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6418-6428Google Scholar) have reported that the carboxyl terminus of IL-8/GROα chimeric proteins affects specificity of binding to IL8R2 but not to IL8R1. Chimeric I51Gα behaved like IL-8 in its binding to IL8R1 but had 5-fold lower affinity for IL8R2(24.Schraufstatter I.U. Barritt D.S. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Cochrane C.G. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6418-6428Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates that the carboxyl terminus of IL-8 beyond amino acid residue 53 does not define receptor specificity for IL8R1 or IL8R2. Exchanges of the carboxyl terminus did not affect neutrophil binding of chimeric IL-8/IP10 (22.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Google Scholar) or IL-8/N51(23.Heinrich J.N. O'Rourke E.C. Chen L. Gray H. Dorfman K.S. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2849-2861Google Scholar), and with truncated analogs of IL-8 the removal of the terminal α-helix reduced but did not prevent neutrophil receptor binding(21.Clark-Lewis I. Schumacher C. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23128-23134Google Scholar). We have identified several variants of IL-8 with specifically altered binding affinity for IL8R1 or IL8R2. Mutations at Tyr13, Phe21, and Leu49 modified IL8R1 binding selectively. Recent studies by Schraufstatter et al. (39.Schraufstatter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Google Scholar) identified Tyr13 as well as Lys15 as determinants of the differential IL8R1 affinity for human and rabbit IL-8. These key residues that affect binding to IL8R1 surround a unique hydrophobic pocket on the surface of IL-8. The increase in binding to IL8R1 by the replacement of Tyr13 with leucine indicates that the removal of the aromatic ring provides increased access for receptor docking. Y13H also decreased binding to IL8R1(39.Schraufstatter I.U. Ma M. Oades Z.G. Barritt D.S. Cochrane C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10428-10431Google Scholar), and other mutations at this position altered binding to neutrophils(22.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Google Scholar). The increased binding to IL8R1 of F21N can also be explained as facilitating the receptor interaction by the replacement of the aromatic group with smaller amino acids. F21L had reduced binding to neutrophils(22.Clark-Lewis I. Dewald B. Loetscher M. Moser B. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16075-16081Google Scholar). Substitutions at Leu49 are not as clear-cut. L49F decreases binding to IL8R1, which could be interpreted as the large aromatic ring of phenylalanine obstructing the receptor docking. L49A also decreases R1 binding, which might suggest that this is due to an alteration of the hydrophobic pocket itself. The replacement with an intermediately sized residue, L49S, moderately increased binding. The double mutation Y13L/S14Q decreases binding to IL8R2 selectively, indicating that IL8R2 recognition involves different determinants than IL8R1 but is also localized near the hydrophobic pocket on IL-8. Thus this region contributes to IL8R2 binding, and the pocket itself may be essential for binding to IL8R1. The surface-accessible hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 is sufficiently large to accommodate an aromatic ring structure and could accept a phenylalanine or tyrosine side chain from IL8R1. The region of the hydrophobic pocket, and particularly of residues 12-18 within the amino-terminal loop, corresponds to the site of greatest structural differences between IL-8 and other C-X-C chemokines (GROα and NAP-2) that bind to IL8R2 but not to IL8R1(18.Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T.J. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Google Scholar, 19.Malkowski M.G. Wu J.Y. Lazar J.B. Johnson P.H. Edwards B.F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7077-7087Google Scholar). The solution structure of GROα indicates a hydrophobic pocket smaller than that on IL-8(18.Fairbrother W.J. Reilly D. Colby T.J. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 252-270Google Scholar). For GROγ, homology-based structural modeling predicted that the hydrophobic pocket is much smaller and more restricted in access, consistent with the lack of IL8R1 binding and reduced IL8R2 binding. Interleukin-8 interacts with two sites on IL-8 receptors; conserved charged residues in extracellular domains 3 and 4 are essential for IL-8 binding to IL8R1 or IL8R2(40.Leong S.R. Kabakoff R.C. Hébert C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19343-19348Google Scholar), and the amino-terminal extracellular domains confer the ligand specificity profiles characteristic of each receptor type(41.LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Google Scholar, 42.Gayle III, R.B. Sleath P.R. Srinivason S. Birks C.W. Weerawarna K.S. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Nelson N. VandenBos T. Beckmann M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7283-7289Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the hydrophobic pocket and/or surrounding residues contribute to the binding of C-X-C chemokines to IL-8 receptors and serve as the second binding site on IL-8 to modify receptor recognition in conjunction with the ELR sequence. Thus, receptor extracellular domains 3 and 4 provide the primary interaction with ELR (residues 4-6) of IL-8, and receptor amino-terminal domains interact with a secondary binding site localized in or near the surface hydrophobic pocket on IL-8 bounded by residues Tyr13, Lys15, Phe21, and Arg47.

However, sequence variation inside the V3 loop diminishes its effectiveness as a potential vaccine against HIV-1. The elusive nature of the V3 loop structure prompted us to carry out a systematic study on different isolates in an attempt to identify a common structural motif in the V3 loop regardless of the amino acid sequence variability. We have previously determined the structural features of two V3 loops: V3 Thailand and V3 MN. In this paper, we present the structure of two other variants: V3 Haiti and V3 RF. Our results show that similar secondary structures are observed in all the four V3 loops: a GPG(R/K/Q) crest in the center of the neutralizing domain, two extended regions flanking the central crest, and a helical region in the C-terminal domain. For the Haitian V3 loop, we also show how the conserved structural features are masked through a conformational switch encoded in the amino acid sequences on the C-terminal side of the GPGK crest.

However, the amino acid sequence variation within the V3 loop has eluded the effectiveness of V3-based vaccine design(4.Javaherian K. Langlois A.J. McDanal C. Ross K.L. Eckler L.I. Jellis C.L.

Antibodies against the V3 loop generally exhibit type-specific neutralization profiles(6.Mathews T.J. Langlois A.J. Robey W.G. Chang N.T. Gallo R.C. Fischinger P.J. Bolognesi D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Gianakakos V. Karwowska S. Williams C. Sheppard H.Y. Hanson C.V. Zolla-Pazner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3238-3242Google Scholar, 8.Steimer K.S. Scandella C.J. Skiles P.V. Haigwood N.L. Science. 1991; 254: 105-108Google Scholar). To better understand the effect of sequence variation on the structure and antigenicity of the HIV-V3 loop, we developed a method combining molecular modeling (9.Gupta G. Myers G. Cinquieme Colloque des Cent Gardes. Pasteur, Paris1990: 99-105Google Scholar, 28.Veronese F.D. Reitz M.S. Gupta G. Robert-Guroff M. Boyer-Thompson C. Louie A. Gallo R. Lusso P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25894-25901Google Scholar) and two-dimensional NMR(10.Gupta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Scott D.R. Eldridge J.H. Myers G. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1993; 11: 345-366Google Scholar, 11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar) to analyze the global structure of the entire cyclic V3 loop and the local structure at the neutralizing determinant. We attempted to answer two specific questions: (i) Are there conserved secondary structural elements inside the V3 loop in spite of sequence variation? and (ii) Can the sequence variation inside the V3 loop mask this conserved secondary structure? Recently, we have shown (12.Fontenot J.D. Gatewood J.M. Mariappan S.V.S. Pau C.-P. Parekh B.S. George J.R. Gupta G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 315-319Google Scholar) that in spite of the observed sequence variation, a conserved secondary structure is located inside the V3 loop. This structure consists of a solvent-accessible protruding motif (or a knob) spanning 8-10 residues with a central GPG(Q/R/K) type II turn at the crest of the knob(10.Gupta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Scott D.R. Eldridge J.H. Myers G. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1993; 11: 345-366Google Scholar, 11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol.

In this article, we demonstrate how amino acid sequence variation flanking the GPG crest can camouflage an otherwise conformationally pure epitope. For this purpose, we performed two-dimensional NMR and molecular modeling studies on two cyclic V3 loops from the Haitian and RF isolates(13.Milich L. Margolin B. Swanstrom R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5623-5634Google Scholar):(Cysteines at position 2 and 36 are S-S bridged; the first cysteine that is underlined in the sequence has a protective group on S; site-specific differences in sequence are marked in bold).MATERIALS AND METHODSSynthesis and PurificationThe cyclic Haitian V3 loop was synthesized and purified by Dr. Anita Hong (Anaspec, CA). The cyclic RF V3 loop was synthesized and purified by Dr. G. M. Anantharamaiah, University of Alabama at Birmingham. Both Drs. Hong and Anantharamaiah provided their services under a contract with the AIDS Division of the National Institutes of Health.NMR SpectroscopyAll NMR experiments on the RF V3 loop were carried out on the 600 MHz Bruker spectrometer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, whereas the data on the Haitian V3 loop were collected on a 500 MHz Bruker AMX spectrometer at Chemistry, Science, and Technology-4, Los Alamos National Laboratory. NMR spectra were collected at 10°C with 3 mM peptide concentration (pH 5.5) for the Haitian V3 loop and at 5 mM peptide concentration (pH 5.5) for the RF V3 loop. All two-dimensional data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode with the presaturation of the HDO signal during the relaxation delay. DQF-COSY data (14.Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar) were collected with the following acquisition parameters: t2 = 4096, t1 = 1024, relaxation delay = 1.5 s, number of transients = 32 for the Haitian V3 loop and number of transients = 48 for the RF V3 loop. Total correlated spectroscopy data (14.Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar) were collected with the following parameters: t2 = 2048, t1 = 1024, relaxation delay = 1.5 s, number of transients = 32/48, isotropic mixing = 70 ms. NOESY (14.Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Google Scholar) data were collected with similar acquisition parameters and with 75 and 250 ms of mixing time (tm) for the Haitian V3 loop and 200 and 400 ms for the RF V3 loop. The sequential assignments ( 2Authors on request will provide additional data containing proton NMR assignments, Jα coupling constants, NOE volumes, NOE-derived distances, cartesian coordinates, torsional angle data of the the three structures: V3 Haiti in water and in the mixed water/TFE solvent and V3 RF in water. The surface accessibility data of the three structures in Figure 6:, Figure 7:, Figure 8: are also available from the authors on request.) were performed by combining the total correlated spectroscopy, DQF-COSY, and NOESY data, processed on a SGI Indigo instrument using the Felix software (BioSym Inc.).Structure DerivationTwo-dimensional NMR data of the Haitian V3 loop in water and in TFE/water mixture and for the RF V3 loop in water were analyzed with the aid of full-matrix NOESY simulations, associated R-factor test, and energy calculations(10.Gupta G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar). This produced a set of distance constraints(9.Gupta G. Myers G. Cinquieme Colloque des Cent Gardes. Pasteur, Paris1990: 99-105Google Scholar, 10.Gupta G.

The energy term (EDIST defining the distance constraints) is added to the force field as in the work of Scheraga and co-workers(15.Roterman I.K. Gibson K.D. Scheraga H.A. J. Biomol.

Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Google Scholar) is performed to obtain a set of structures in agreement with NMR data. The maximum step size of the torsion angles was set at 15°, which produced an acceptance ratio of 0.20-0.30 for the 50,000 step MC cycle at each temperature. Full-matrix NOESY calculations were repeated for the final 50 low energy structures of the V3 loop. We define distances from the NOE data in terms of the upper and lower limits (range is above 0.5 Å). However, in our sampled structures the violations of these distances are ~0.22 Å. This implies that the uncertainty in distance estimate is always above 0.7 Å.RESULTSNMR Experiment on the Haitian V3 LoopFig. 1A shows the NOESY fingerprint HN-Hα region of the Haitian V3 loop in water at 10°C for 250 ms of mixing. Fig. 1B shows the DQF-COSY fingerprint HN-Hα region of the Haitian V3 loop in water at 10°C; the ranges of φ values are estimated from JHN-Hα coupling data. Note the presence of intra-residue HN-Hα and inter-residue HN(i+1)-Hα(i) cross-peaks. Proline residues (Pro5, Pro14, and Pro17) show Hδ(Pi+1)-Hα(i) cross-peaks. Note that residues Cys1, Cys2, Thr3, and Arg4 do not show any cross-peaks. Fig. 1C shows the NOESY HN-HN region of the Haitian V3 loop in water at 10°C for 300 ms of mixing. Although a set of sequential HN-HN cross-peaks are observed in the C-terminal stretch (residues 28-33) of the V3 loop, no medium range NOEs like Hα(i)-Hβ(i+3) or HN(i)-Hβ(i+3) cross-peaks are seen as a corroboratory evidence of a helical stretch. Fig. 3 summarizes the NOE data of the Haitian V3 loop in aqueous environment from the analyses of the data at 100 and 300 ms of mixing. Note that only a few Hβ(i)-HN(i+1) cross-peaks are observed for the Haitian V3 loop in the aqueous environment. Seven nonsequential NOESY cross-peaks are observed (see panel of Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Summary of the NMR data for the HIV Haitian V3 loop in water (under panel 1) and in water/TFE (7:3) mixed solvent (under panel 2). In addition to sequential Hα-HN, Hβ-HN, and HN-HN NOEs, six sequential Hβ-HN NOEs were obtained in both the solvents. The sequential Hβ-HN connectivity for Pro is missing, but the sequential Hα-Hδ NOEs provide the link. Note the solvent-induced change in the sequential NOE pattern in the C-terminal segment; in the mixed solvent, there is an enhancement of the sequential HN-HN NOEs relative to the corresponding Hα-HN NOEs, indicative of an induction of a helix.2 In a previous work(24.Chandrasekhar K. Profy A.T. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9187-9194Google Scholar, 25.Zvi A. Hiller R. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6972-6979Google Scholar), the NMR assignments of the V3 loops of MN and IIIB isolates in aqueous solution were obtained. The authors also performed CD studies on TFE mixed solutions but did not succeed in assigning the NMR spectra in such mixed solvents. In another NMR work(26.de Lorimier R. Moody M.A. Haynes B.F. Spicer L.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2055-2062Google Scholar), the authors studied two 24 linear peptides containing the neutralizing determinant of the IIIB isolate of HIV-1. They reported (26.de Lorimier R. Moody M.A. Haynes B.F. Spicer L.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2055-2062Google Scholar) the presence of a transient turn at the GPGR crest, and the ability of mixed TFE solutions to induce helical conformation in the C-terminal domain of the peptides, whereas in water only a #x0201C;nascent” helix formed by a stretch if interconnected turns was observed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2A shows the NOESY fingerprint HN-Hα region of the Haitian V3 loop in a water/TFE (7:3) mixture at 10°C for 250 ms of mixing. Although the cross-peaks of the Haitian V3 loop are broader in the mixed solvent than in the aqueous environment, we are able to assign residues 5-36. Fig. 2B shows the NOESY HN-HN region of the Haitian V3 loop in the mixed solvent at 10°C for 250 ms of mixing. Due to the broadness of the peaks it is not possible to decipher the interaction of two HN protons that are close to the diagonal. However, quite a number of distinct HN-HN cross-peaks are observed in this cross-section. Fig. 3 summarizes the NOE data of the Haitian V3 loop in the mixed solvent from the analyses of the data at 75 and 250 ms of mixing. The NOE data of the Haitian V3 loop in the mixed solvent is distinct from that in water in the following respects. (i) Medium range Hα(i)-Hβ(i+3) cross-peaks are observed for the residue pairs (27, 30), (31, 28), (32, 29), and (33, 30) which are indicative of a helical core spanning residues 27-33. (ii) Although there is a decrease in the absolute intensities of sequential HN-Hαand HN-HN cross-peaks, there is an enhancement in the relative HN-HN/HN-Hα cross-peak intensities for residues 26-34, which is again indicative of a helical structure in this segment. (iii) A few sequential Hβ-HN cross-peaks are observed in this stretch that are either weak or absent in the aqueous solvent. (iv) Finally, the Hα protons of the residues 27-34 in the C terminus of the Haitian V3 loop are high field shifted in the mixed solvent as also observed in the case of the MN V3 loop(11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar).Figure 2:NOESY cross-sections of the cyclic Haitian V3 loop in water/TFE (7:3) mixture (peptide concentration = 3.0 mM, pH 5.5, temperature = 10°C). The HDO signal was presaturated for 1.2 s during the relaxation delay. Acquisition parameters: data matrix (t2 = 2048 data points, t1 = 1024 data points), relaxation delay = 1.2 s, number of transients = 32, temperature = 10°C. A, the fingerprint HN-Ha region. B, the HN-HN region. In the fingerprint region note the double population of the residue Gly18. One of the populations has an additional medium range NOE between Hα-G18 and HN-F21, indicating a conformational equilibrium between two forms, one extended and one bent at the fragment Gly18-Lys19-Ala20-Phe21. Interestingly such a double population for Gly18 is also observed in water, although the medium range NOE with F21 absent in the aqueous environment (see Fig. 1). Note that uniform upfield shift of the Hα resonances in the C-terminal region of the peptide that is a strong indicator of the helical conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The residues in the neutralizing epitope, Ile13-Pro14-Met15-Gly16-Pro17-Gly18-Lys19-Ala20-Phe21-Tyr22, are unequivocally assigned in water and in the solvent. Two conformational states of Gly18 (i.e. Gly18 and Gly18*) are clearly evident. Gly18 not only shows two populations in terms of the chemical shift values of (Hα,HN) but also in terms of the NOESY connectivities. As shown in Fig. 2A, a second population of Gly18* is observed in mixed populations; Gly18 shows a Hα(G18)-HN(F21) cross-peak (Fig. 3). The chemical shift of other residues in the second population are indistinguishable from the first. Although this conformational variant is also present in the aqueous solvent, the absence of the Hα(G18)-HN(F21) cross-peak suggests that such an interaction perhaps is not stabilized in a polar environment.NMR Experiment on the RF V3 LoopWe have chosen the RF V3 loop to examine the effect of sequence variation on the overall folding of the V3 loop and the local structure at the GPG crest. The RF V3 loop is different from the Haitian V3 loop at eight positions and is more positively charged. Fig. 4A shows the NOESY fingerprint HN-Hα region of the RF V3 loop in water at 10°C for 400 ms of mixing. Note the presence of intra-residue HN-Hα and inter-residue HN(i+1)-Hα(i) cross-peaks except for the residues Cys1, Cys2, Thr3, Arg4, Pro5, and Asn6, possibly due to inherent flexibility in the N-terminal region. Fig. 4B shows the NOESY HN-HN region of the RF V3 loop in water at 10°C for 300 ms of mixing. Although a set of sequential HN-HN cross-peaks are observed in the C-terminal stretch (residues 29-34) of the V3 loop, no medium range NOEs indicative of helical fragments are seen. Fig. 5 summarizes the NOE data of the RF V3 loop in the aqueous environment from the analyses of the data at 200 and 400 ms of mixing. Only intra-residue and sequential NOEs are observed. The JHN-Hα coupling constants from the DQF-COSY spectrum (Fig. 4C)) provide the φ values, which are converted into HN-Hα intra-residue distances.2 The lack of solubility of the highly polar RF V3 loop prevented us from carrying out NMR experiments in the mixed water/TFE (7:3) solvent.Figure 4:NOESY (mixing time = 400 ms) and DQF-COSY cross-sections of the cyclic RF V3 loop in water (peptide concentration = 5.0 mM, pH 5.5). A, the fingerprint HN-Ha region. B, the HN-HN region. C, DQF-COSY cross-sections of the cyclic RF V3 loop. For NOESY experiments, the acquisition parameters were as follows: t2 = 2048 data points, t1 = 1024 data points, relaxation delay = 1.5 s, number of transients = 32. Same acquisition parameters were used for the DQF-COSY experiment except for t2, which was increased to 4 K. Sequence-specific assignments were obtained starting from Val20 (only Val in the sequence) and moving backward and forward along the connectivity route until completion of the assignments. Assignments in the fragment Cys1-Asn7 were not possible, presumably due to the intrinsic flexibility in the region Asn6-Asn7-Asn8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5:Summary of the NMR data for the HIV RF V3 loop in water. Sequential Hα-HN, Hβ-HN, and HN-HN NOEs. The sequential Ha-HN connectivity for Pro is missing, but the sequential Hα-Hδ NOEs provide the NOE link.2 Lorimier et al.(26.de Lorimier R. Moody M.A. Haynes B.F. Spicer L.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2055-2062Google Scholar) studied a 40-residue-long peptide containing a T-helper epitope 16 residue long in the N-terminal region and a 24-residue-long segment derived from the V3 loop of the HIV-RF isolate studied in this work. In the V3 loop region the authors observed the GPGR turn, whether the rest of the C-terminal fragment was mostly disordered. However, we would like to stress that in the study of the linear peptides(24.Chandrasekhar K. Profy A.T. Dyson H.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9187-9194Google Scholar, 25.Zvi A. Hiller R. Anglister J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6972-6979Google Scholar), the authors did not consider the importance of the disulfide bridge locking the V3 fragment in a closed loop. We have previously shown that the cyclic V3 loops are better ligands for V3-specific antibodies(11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Structures of the Haitian V3 LoopWe have previously reported structural studies on the Thailand and MN V3 loops(10.Gupta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Scott D.R. Eldridge J.H. Myers G. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1993; 11: 345-366Google Scholar, 11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar). The NMR data for those two sequences revealed that the structure of the V3 loop contained a few reasonably well defined secondary structural elements, i.e. a GPGR(Q) turn and a nascent C-terminal helix. However, the V3 loops are considerably flexible within the constraints of these secondary structural elements and the Cys2-Cys2 disulfide bridge. Therefore, we developed and applied a method to explore the extent of conformational flexibility of the V3 loop that is consistent with the NMR data(10.Gupta G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Scott D.R. Eldridge J.H. Myers G. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1993; 11: 345-366Google Scholar, 11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar). Briefly, we employ the following steps. (i) We analyze the NMR data to assign secondary structural states, i.e. ranges of φ and ψ values, to the residues of the V3 loop. The NMR data for the aqueous form include the NOEs in Fig. 3 and the DQF-COSY data (Fig. 1C); the JHN-Hα coupling constants from the DQF-COSY spectrum provide the φ values, which are converted into HN-Hα intra-residue distances.2 Line broadening in the mixed solvent prevented us from obtaining a high quality DQF-COSY spectrum in the water/TFE (7:3) mixture. (ii) We obtain a set of starting (energy minimized) structures of the V3 loop subject to the φ and ψ values and disulfide bridge constraints. (iii) We then use these starting structures for Monte Carlo simulated annealing and energy minimizations for sampling the conformational space. (iv) We finally select a set of low energy structures (50 for the Haitian V3 loop) and analyze the conformational parameters to examine the nature of the flexibility.Fig. 6 shows the ribbon models of the Haitian V3 loop in water (left) and water/TFE (7:3) mixture (right). The following color coding was used in these ribbon diagrams: gray for the N-terminal protruding loop at position T3-R10, green for the N-terminal extended β-strand flanking the GPG crest, magenta for the central β-turn at position G16-P17-G18-K19, yellow for the C-terminal extended β-strand flanking the GPG crest, and blue for the C-terminal segment D26-H35, which can form an α-helix. In water the C-terminal segment consists of consecutive β-turns centered around Ile28-Gly29 and Ile31-Arg32, whereas in the water/TFE (7:3) mixture it further folds into a well defined α-helix as evidenced by the presence of sequential HN-HN NOEs (Fig. 2B) and medium range Hβ(i+3)-Hα(i) NOEs (Fig. 3B, panel 2). Due to the intrinsic conformational flexibility of the V3 loop, side chains are quite mobile, and they do not sample a single rotamer conformation. In these representations only average positions for the side chains are shown. However, in the α-helical region for the mixed solvent structure, the side chains are organized in a cylindrical array as experimentally observed by the presence of a network of dαβ(i,i+3) and dαN sequential connectivities (Fig. 3B). Nonetheless, in both the structures (Fig. 6) the neutralizing epitope containing the central GPGK sequence forms a protruding loop even though the local structure and presentation of the loop in the two cases are noticeably different. The aqueous structure of the Haitian V3 loop in Fig. 6 is the average of 50 sampled configurations that exhibit rms deviations below 1.5 Å with respect to the backbone atoms. Out of 50 sampled structures of the Haitian V3 loop in the TFE/water mixture, a small subset of six structures shows a large (>2.6Å) rms deviation of the backbone atoms from the rest of the structures. The remaining 44 structures are within 1.6 Å rms deviations of the backbone atoms. The average structure in Fig. 6 is taken over these 44 structures.Figure 6:The ribbon diagrams describe representative folding patterns for the structures of the Haitian V3 loop in water (left) and in mixed water/TFE solvent (right). The following color coding was used in these ribbon diagrams: gray for the N-terminal protruding loop, green for the N-terminal extended β-strand flanking the GPG crest, magenta for the central β-turn at the GPG crest, yellow for the C-terminal extended β-strand flanking the GPG crest, and blue for the C-terminal segment, which can form an α-helix. In each case, the average is done over 50 sampled low energy structures. Ribbon models in the two cases correspond to the average structure. All the sampled structures of the Haitian V3 loop in water showed rms deviations of 0.24 ± 0.02 Å with respect to 95 independent distance constraints. All the sampled structures of the Haitian V3 loop in mixed water/TFE solvent showed rms deviations of 0.27 ± 0.02 Å with respect to 123 independent distance constraints. The structures of the Haitian V3 loop in water show a greater degree of flexibility than those in the mixed water/TFE solvent; this is due to the formation of the C-terminal helix in the mixed solvent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7 shows two conformations representing the aqueous environment (left) and the mixed solvent forms (right). The central region of the Haitian V3 loop containing the neutralizing determinant residues Ile13-Pro14-Met15-Gly16-Pro17-Gly18-Lys19-Ala20-Phe21-Tyr22 is shown. The following color coding was used in these skeleton models: red for the central Gly16-Pro17-Gly18-Lys19 crest, green for the N-terminal Ile13-Pro14-Met15 residues in extended conformation, and yellow for the C-terminal Ala20-Phe21-Tyr22 residues, which show a solvent-induced effect. In the water structure the C-terminal fragment is in an extended conformation (open state). In the mixed solvent, two types of chain folding are observed: one folded form is similar to that of the MN-V3 loop(11.Catasti P. Fontenot J.D. Bradbury E.M. Gupta G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2224-2232Google Scholar), whereas in the other, the GPG crest forms the typical type II β-turn followed by a type III β-turn involving residues Gly18-Arg18-Ala20-Phe21, as evidenced by the presence of a medium range NOE between α-G18 and HN-F21 (closed state). Such an S-shaped conformation has been previously reported for a peptide containing the V3 neutralizing determinant complexed to an antibody(18.Ghiara J.B. Stura E.A. Stanfield R.L. Profy A.T.

Evidence has accumulated which suggests that a liver-enriched transcription factor, likely a member of the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family, is required along with other ubiquitously expressed transcription factors to mediate this liver-specific response to cAMP. In this study, we examined the ability of C/EBP to participate in the cAMP-mediated activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene transcription in hepatoma cells. Expression of a dominant repressor of C/EBP in hepatoma cells significantly inhibited the protein kinase A-stimulated transcription of the PEPCK promoter, suggesting that a C/EBP family member was required for maximal transcriptional activation by protein kinase A. To provide additional support for this hypothesis, we prepared GAL4 fusion proteins containing C/EBP domains. Both C/EBPα and C/EBPβ GAL4 fusion proteins were capable of stimulating transcription from promoters containing binding sites for the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. However, only the GAL4-C/EBPα fusion protein demonstrated the ability to synergize with the other transcription factors bound to the PEPCK promoter which are required to mediate cAMP responsiveness. The DNA-binding domain of C/EBPα was not required for this activity in hepatoma cells, although in non-hepatoma cells the basic region leucine zipper domain appeared to inhibit the ability of C/EBPα to participate in mediating cAMP responsiveness. These results suggest that the liver-specific nature of the cAMP responsiveness of the PEPCK promoter involves the recruitment of C/EBPα to the cAMP response unit.

https://openalex.org/W2064808936,"M-CAT sites are required for the activity of many promoters in cardiac and skeletal muscle. M-CAT binding activity is muscle-enriched, but is found in many tissues and is immunologically related to the HeLa transcription enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1). TEF-1-related cDNAs (RTEF-1) have been cloned from chick heart. RTEF-1 mRNA is muscle-enriched, consistent with a role for RTEF-1 in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression. Here, we have examined the tissue distribution of TEF-1-related proteins and of M-CAT binding activity by Western analysis and mobility shift polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. TEF-1-related proteins of 57, 54 and 52 kDa were found in most tissues with the highest levels in muscle tissues. All of these TEF-1-related proteins bound M-CAT DNA and the 57- and 54-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptides were phosphorylated. Proteolytic digestion mapping showed that the 54-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptide is encoded by a different gene than the 52- and 57-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptides. A comparison of the migration and proteolytic digestion of the 54-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptide with proteins encoded by the cloned RTEF-1 cDNAs showed that the 54-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptide is encoded by RTEF-1A. High resolution mobility shift polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed multiple M-CAT binding activities in tissues. All of these activities contained TEF-1-related proteins. One protein-M-CAT DNA complex was muscle-enriched and was up-regulated upon differentiation of a skeletal muscle cell line. This complex contained the 54-kDa TEF-1-related polypeptide. Therefore, RTEF1-A protein is a component of a muscle-enriched transcription complex that forms on M-CAT sites and may play a key role in the regulation of transcription in muscle."

All Ca2+ binding site mutations were generated by replacing the Asp at the X-coordinating position of the Ca2+ binding loop with Ala. The binding of these mutated proteins to TnC-depleted skinned skeletal muscle fibers was investigated as well as the rate of their dissociation from these fibers. The proteins were also tested for their ability to restore steady state force to TnC-depleted fibers. We found that although the NH2-terminal mutant of TnC (TnC1,2-) bound to the TnC-depleted fibers (with a lower affinity than wild type TnC (WTnC)), it was unable to reactivate Ca2+-dependent force. This supports earlier findings that the low affinity Ca2+ binding sites (I and II) in TnC are responsible for the Ca2+-dependent activation of skeletal muscle contraction. All three COOH-terminal mutants of TnC bound to the TnC-depleted fibers, had different rates of dissociation, and could restore steady state force to the level of unextracted fibers. Although both high affinity Ca2+ binding sites (III and IV) are important for binding to the fibers, site III appears to be the primary determinant for maintaining the structural stability of TnC in the thin filament.

Although purified His-tagged α subunit showed the characteristic absorption spectra of Rieske-type protein, reassociation of this enzyme component and His-tagged β subunit to reconstitute active ISPBPH was weak. However, when His-tagged α and β subunits were reassembled in vitro in crude cell extracts from E. coli recombinants, active ISPBPH could be purified on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin.

We have dissociated the ACDS complex into three protein components by limited proteolytic digestion. Catalysis of acetyl-CoA synthesis was lost in parallel with the loss of the intact β subunit; however, no decrease in activity was detected in any of three partial reactions found to be catalyzed by distinct protein components of the proteolyzed ACDS complex: (<i>a</i>) CO dehydrogenase, catalyzed by the αϵ component, (<i>b</i>) CH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>4</sub>pteridine:cob(I)amide-protein methyltransferase, catalyzed by the intact γ subunit and fragments of the δ subunit, and (<i>c</i>) acetyltransferase, catalyzed by a truncated form of the β subunit.

Fourier transform infrared and laser Raman difference spectroscopy were used to establish correlations between spectral changes and drug binding mode, sequence selectivity, DNA conformation, and structural properties of DES•DNA complexes in aqueous solution. Spectroscopic results indicated that DES is a weak intercalator with affinity for A-T-rich regions. It is also a groove binder with a major interaction with the thymine O-2 atom. At low drug concentration (r = 1:40), the A-T-rich region is the main target of drug intercalation, while at a higher drug content (r > 1:5), external binding to the G-C bases also occurs with a partial helix destabilization. Evidence for this comes from the spectral alterations of the A-T vibrational frequencies at 1661 cm-1 (Raman) and 1663 and 1609 cm-1 (IR) and of the G-C vibrations at 1581 and 1491 cm-1 (Raman) and 1717 and 1492 cm-1 (IR).

M-CAT binding activities present in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues cannot be fully accounted for by existing cloned isoforms of TEF-1. TEF-1-related cDNAs isolated from heart libraries indicate that at least three classes of TEF-1-related cDNAs are expressed in these and other tissues. One class are homologues of the human TEF-1 originally cloned from HeLa cells (Xiao, J. H., Davidson, I., Matthes, H., Garnier, J. M., and Chambon, P.(1991) Cell 65, 551-568). A second class represents homologues of the avian TEF-1-related gene previously isolated (Stewart, A. F., Larkin, S. B., Farrance, I. K., Mar, J. H., Hall, D. E., and Ordahl, C. P.(1994) J. Biol.

Two isoforms of DTEF-1 (DTEF-1A and DTEF-1B) were isolated as 1.9-kilobase pair clones with putative open reading frames of 433 and 432 amino acids whose differences are attributable to alternative splicing at the C terminus of the TEA DNA binding domain. Cardiac muscle contains high levels of DTEF-1 transcripts, but unexpectedly low levels are detected in skeletal muscle. DTEF-1 transcripts are present at intermediate levels in gizzard and lung, and at low levels in kidney. DTEF-1A is a sequence-specific M-CAT-binding factor. The distinct spatial pattern of expression, and unusual amino acid sequence in its DNA binding domain, may indicate a particular role for DTEF-1 in cell-specific gene regulation.

Upon differentiation, the cytoplasm of myogenic progenitor cells is converted to a highly organized sarcomeric array. This process is dependent upon the activation and expression of genes in a specific temporal sequence that is coordinated by transcription factors. In developing skeletal muscle, for example, the expression of most skeletal muscle-specific genes is dependent upon the myoD family of transcription factors (also known as myogenic determination factors or MDFs( 1The abbreviations used are: MDFmyogenic determination factorbHLHbasic helix-loop-helixMCBFM-CAT binding factorTEFtranscription enhancer factorbpbase pair(s)kbpkilobase pair(s).) ; for review see (1.Olson E.N.

MDFs are muscle-specific proteins of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) superfamily that form heterodimers with ubiquitous bHLH nuclear proteins, and thereby bind E boxes in muscle gene promoters. MDFs can also activate the skeletal myogenic program in many non-muscle cells, converting them to the skeletal muscle phenotype(4.Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J.

Many cardiac gene promoters, on the other hand, are regulated through DNA sequences known as M-CAT motifs (5′-CATTCCT-3′). M-CAT-dependent promoter activity was first described in the chicken cardiac troponin T gene(8.Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6404-6408Google Scholar, 9.Mar J.H.

The M-CAT motif is bound by M-CAT binding factor(s), or MCBF, which is enriched in the nuclei of striated muscle, but is also present in non-muscle tissues(9.Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Google Scholar, 14.Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Google Scholar). All muscle MCBFs have been shown to be antigenically and biochemically related to TEF-1, transcription enhancer factor-1(14.Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol.

TEF-1 was first cloned from Hela cells where it binds the M-CAT-related GTIIC and Sph elements in the SV40 enhancer(15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P.

TEF-1 is a member of the TEA/ATTS domain family of transcription factors that are characterized by a structurally conserved DNA binding domain(18.Andrianopoulos A. Timberlake W.E. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 747-748Google Scholar, 19.Burglin T.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Google Scholar). The TEA domain has been found in the amino-terminal regions of a class of regulatory proteins and is conserved across many species. The yeast regulatory protein TEC1 is involved in the activation of the Ty1 retrotransposon(20.Laloux I. Dubois E. Dewerchin M. Jacobs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3541-3550Google Scholar), ABAA regulates conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans and terminates vegetative growth(21.Mirabito P.M. Adams T.H. Timberlake W.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 859-868Google Scholar), and the Drosophila gene scalloped plays an important role in neurodifferentiation(22.Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. Raghavan V. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Google Scholar). Functional mammalian TEF-1 is found in the 2-8-cell stage in early mouse development(23.Melin F. Miranda M. Montreau N. DePamphilis M.L. Blangy D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4657-4666Google Scholar), and insertional knockout of the murine homologue of the human TEF-1 gene results in embryonic lethality accompanied by hypoplasia and/or degeneration of the ventricular myocardium(24.Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Google Scholar). Previously, we cloned a class of TEF-1-related cDNAs from heart and skeletal muscle that includes at least four alternatively spliced cDNA products (designated TEF-1A, −1B, −1C, and −1D) of the same gene. TEF-1A mRNAs are expressed in many tissues but are enriched in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. In addition, isoproteins encoded by TEF-1A and −1B cDNAs are bona fide M-CAT binding factors. TEF-1B, at least, can activate transcription when linked to a heterologous DNA binding domain(25.Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar). Muscle tissues contain at least three protein•M-CAT complexes on electrophoretic mobility shift assays, one of which appears to be muscle-specific and up-regulated upon differentiation(32.Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Google Scholar). All muscle protein•M-CAT complexes contain TEF-1 proteins, but the latter muscle-enriched complex contains TEF-1A and not other TEF-1 related proteins(32.Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8266-8274Google Scholar). Additional TEF-1-related cDNAs might, therefore, account for the multiple protein•M-CAT complexes found in muscle and non-muscle tissues. We have identified a new, divergent class of TEA domain gene that we name DTEF-1, for divergent TEF-1. DTEF-1 is a sequence-specific M-CAT binding factor whose mRNA is highly enriched in cardiac muscle. Thus, DTEF-1 may be involved in the cardiac-specific regulation of M-CAT-dependent promoters. Complementary DNA synthesized from chick retina RNA was used for polymerase chain reaction amplification of TEF-1 cDNA products using the following primers: sense, 5′-TGG AG(T/C) CCN GA(T/C) AT(T/C) AGA (A/G)CA-3′; antisense, 5′-ATC AT(A/G) TA(T/C) TC(A/G) CAC AT(G/T/C) GG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction was conducted in an automated thermal cycler for 35 cycles under the following conditions: 1 min at 94°C, 1 min 30 s at 55°C, and 1 min 30 s at 72°C. A 900-bp fragment was isolated and used to screen an adult chick heart cDNA library (Clontech). Five TEF-1 cDNAs were isolated, and one of these was used to screen a seven week chick heart cDNA library (1 × 106 recombinants, Stratagene) under reduced stringency conditions (40% formamide, 40°C, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Clones were sequenced on both strands using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or a dideoxy Taq DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence comparisons were performed using the GAP program of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package (Genetics Computer Group). Total RNA from embryonic day 12 chick tissues was isolated using standard methods(26.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Twenty-five μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose, 1.1 M formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Corp.). Cross-linking, prehybridization, and hybridization were as described by the manufacturer. A DTEF-1 specific probe was used for hybridization consisting of a 366-bp EcoRI-PvuII fragment (nucletotides 1-366) that was labeled by random priming (Rediprime, Amersham) with [32P]dCTP (Amersham, 6000 Ci/mmol) to a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg. Membranes were hybridized for 18 h and then washed at 42°C with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and at 65°C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS prior to autoradiography. Ethidium bromide staining of the gel prior to transfer was used to verify the equivalence of total RNA loads. The SmaI/EcoRI (nucletotides 388 to 3′ end) fragment of DTEF-1A was ligated in frame into PvuII/EcoRI digested and phoshatase-treated pRSET vector (Invitrogen). Linearized plasmids were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer (Promega). One microgram of capped RNA was then translated in 20 μl of reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Gel shifts were performed using 5 μl of in vitro translated protein, as described previously(25.Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar). An adult chicken heart cDNA library was screened at low stringency using a TEF-1 cDNA probe. Four cDNA clones were isolated whose nucleotide sequence was determined to represent overlapping cDNA segments derived from one gene with higher amino acid homology to human TEF-1 (97% identity with human TEF-1) than to TEF-1-related cDNAs previously isolated from avian heart and skeletal muscle (25 and data not shown). Because the nucleotide differences between these two classes of cDNA were found throughout their length, we concluded that there are at least two TEA domain genes within the avian genome. To preserve but extend the extant TEF nomenclature (Table 1), we designated as NTEF-1 (Nominal TEF-1; that from which the name is derived) those genes from mouse, rat, and chick most homologous to the human TEF-1 cloned from HeLa cells( 2A. Azakie, unpublished observation.) (10.Shimizu N. Dizon E. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 619-630Google Scholar, 15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar, 27.Blatt C. DePamphilis M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 747-748Google Scholar). Since avian NTEF-1 was more related to human NTEF-1 than to our previously identified chick TEF-1-related cDNAs (96.5% versus 76%; 25), we redesignated these latter cDNAs and any homologous genes/cDNAs from other species as RTEF-1 (Related to TEF-1).Tabled 1 To identify further TEF-1-related genes, and in particular those that might be preferentially expressed during cardiac development, a partial avian NTEF-1 cDNA was used to screen a seven week chicken heart cDNA library under reduced stringency conditions. Of nine cDNA clones isolated, four had nucleotide sequences corresponding to RTEF-1. The nucleotide sequence of five other clones were divergent from that of either NTEF-1 or RTEF-1 (Fig. 1 and data not shown) indicating that a third TEA-domain gene is present in the avian genome. We designate this new TEF-1-related gene DTEF-1 (Divergent TEF-1) to indicate its higher degree of divergence from avian NTEF-1 (see #x0201C;Discussion”). All five apparently full-length (1.9-kb) DTEF-1 cDNAs were identical except for a specific segment that suggests alternative splicing of the primary transcript of the DTEF-1 gene (Fig. 1, A and D) generating predicted isoforms designated DTEF-1A and DTEF-1B. The deduced amino acid sequence of DTEF-1A (Fig. 1B) yields a 433-amino acid polypeptide that is 72% identical to both avian NTEF-1 and RTEF-1A. The TEA domain is highly conserved throughout evolution(18.Andrianopoulos A. Timberlake W.E. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 747-748Google Scholar, 19.Burglin T.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Google Scholar), and there is only a single amino acid change within this domain between the drosophila TEA domain gene scalloped and the human-, mouse-, or chick-derived NTEF-1s (22.Campbell S. Inamdar M. Rodrigues V. Raghavan V. Palazzolo M. Chovnick A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 367-379Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). NTEF-1 and RTEF-1 are identical throughout their TEA domains. However, DTEF-1A, which represented four of the five cDNA clones, has two amino acid differences within the TEA domain as compared to NTEF-1 (Fig. 1C). Amino acid residue 87 of DTEF-1A contains a lysine instead of an arginine, and residue 94 contains a leucine in place of an isoleucine, preserving the basic and aliphatic natures, respectively, of the residues at these two positions. The DTEF-1B isoform is identical to DTEF-1A at the nucleotide and amino acid levels except for an alternatively spliced 23-amino acid exon, extending from Arg87 to Gln109 (Fig. 1D) which replaces Lys87 to Lys87 and includes the last 10 amino acids of the TEA domain. The resultant TEA domain of DTEF-1B is identical to that of NTEF-1 (Fig. 1C). The distribution of DTEF-1 transcripts in embryonic chick tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA using a DTEF-1 specific probe (Fig. 2). Two predominant transcripts were detected; a major 1.9-kb transcript and a minor 3.6-kb transcript. The 1.9-kb transcript length corresponds with that of the cDNAs and so is the presumed fully processed mRNA. The 1.9-kb transcript is highly enriched in cardiac tissue and present at lower levels in lung, gizzard, and kidney (Fig. 2). Skeletal muscle, liver, and brain contain trace levels or none of the 1.9-kb transcript. The minor 3.6-kb transcript is present at low but equivalent levels in heart, skeletal muscle, lung, and gizzard. Because of the considerable sequence conservation between the TEA domains of DTEF-1, RTEF-1, and NTEF-1 we predicted that DTEF-1 would retain the ability to form sequence-specific interactions with M-CAT elements. We tested the DNA binding activity of in vitro translated DTEF-1A protein using gel-retardation assays. Full-length DTEF-1A fusion protein bound to radiolabeled M-CAT probe producing a gel shift complex in the appropriate mobility range (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 4). Moreover, this binding is sequence-specific since the presence of excess wild type M-CAT DNA (Fig. 3, lane 2) competed effectively for binding, while mutant M-CAT competitor (Fig. 3, lane 3) did not. Thus, DTEF-1A is a bona fide M-CAT binding factor. In this study we report evidence that vertebrate TEF-1 comprises a multigene family. Three classes of TEF-1-related genes, NTEF-1, RTEF-1, and DTEF-1, have been tentatively implicated in muscle gene regulation. NTEF-1 is expressed in various tissues including heart, skeletal muscle, lung, kidney, brain, and gizzard, and produces a major 1.6-1.8-kb transcript (15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar, 27.Blatt C. DePamphilis M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 747-748Google Scholar) (data not shown). RTEF-1 is also present in muscle tissue and one isoform can potentially transactivate muscle promoters through binding to M-CAT motifs(25.Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar). DTEF-1 is the newest and most divergent class of TEF-1-related cDNAs. Unlike NTEF-1 and RTEF-1, the expression of DTEF-1 is restricted to a few tissues, and is most highly expressed in heart muscle. Recently, another vertebrate TEF-1 family member was reported (ETF-1) (30.Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Google Scholar). ETF-1 is expressed specifically in a subset of embryonic tissues, including the cerebellum, testis and distal portions of the limb and tail buds, but is essentially absent from adult tissues. Sequence comparison of ETF-1 to avian TEF-1 family members shows that ETF-1 is not any more closely related to any one TEF-1 family member than another, indicating that it is not a true homologue of N-, R-, or DTEF-1. Although ETF-1 shares sequence features with both RTEF-1 and DTEF-1, and is 100% identical to NTEF-1 in the TEA domain, ETF-1 probably represents a fourth class of TEF-1-related genes. We suggest ETF-1 should be renamed ETEF-1 in order to reflect its membership of the TEF-1 family (see below and Table 1). We propose a system of nomenclature for the known TEF-1 related genes in vertebrates (Table 1), taking into account the cloning of ETF-1 in the mouse(30.Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Google Scholar). This nomenclature is based on the first cloned vertebrate TEF-1 family member, human TEF-1(15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). The avian, rat, and murine homologues of human TEF-1 are grouped as NTEF-1 type (Nominal TEF-1, from which the name is derived) ( 3P. C. Simpson, personal communication.) (15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar, 27.Blatt C. DePamphilis M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 747-748Google Scholar) based on their high degree of homology (97% at the amino acid level, see Table 1). Another closely related class of TEF-1 cDNAs/genes, RTEF-1 (Related to NTEF-1) has been identified in chick (25.Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar) and mouse, ( 4J. A. Winkles, personal communication.) sharing higher amino acid sequence homology to each other (89%) than to the NTEF-1 class (74%). The DTEF-1 (Divergent TEF-1) class of TEF-1 cDNAs reported here constitutes a fourth class that is 72% identical to human NTEF-1 with novel changes in the TEA domain (see below). By contrast, all other vertebrate family members cloned to date show 100% identity in the TEA domain. Vertebrate TEF-1-related gene family members characterized to date are believed to initiate translation at an isoleucine codon that lies upstream of the first methionine codon(15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar, 25.Stewart A.F. Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Hall D.E. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3147-3150Google Scholar, 27.Blatt C. DePamphilis M.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 747-748Google Scholar). The size of endogenous and in vivo produced human NTEF-1 corresponds to initiation at an AUU codon and shorter NTEF-1 polypeptides that might initiate at the downstream AUG codon are not detected by anti-TEF-1 antisera(15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). Similarly, the major product of in vitro translated NTEF-1 mRNA also corresponds to an isoleucine initiated protein. Engineering of a perfect Kozak consensus around the first methionine codon does not affect that translation pattern. On the other hand, introduction of a perfect Kozak sequence around the isoleucine codon results in more efficient initiation at that site, while mutation of the isoleucine codon abolishes it(15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar). The first potential AUG (residue 428) initiator codon in the DTEF-1 cDNA is surrounded by a poor Kozak consensus sequence (7/13 nucleotides, underlined in Fig. 1B), but a reasonably favorable Kozak consensus (10/13 nucleotide homology with the Kozak consensus sequence; underlined in Fig. 1B) surrounds the isoleucine codon (AUA) at nucleotide 352. That isoleucine 352 codon corresponds to the one identified as the initiator for human NTEF-1 as outlined above (15.Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Google Scholar) and initiates a conceptual open reading frame of 433 amino acids whose sequence is closely related to that of other vertebrate TEF-1-related genes (see Table 1) and consists of a serine-rich N terminus, followed by a highly conserved, basic TEA domain, and then a proline-rich region. We tentatively conclude, therefore, that DTEF-1 translation probably initiates at an isoleucine codon and that the DNA binding and transactivation motif pattern is grossly conserved through all classes of vertebrate TEF-1 cDNAs consistent with general conservation of function for this protein. Two isoforms of the DTEF-1 cDNA were isolated. The nucleotide sequence of the DTEF-1A cDNA isoform differs from that of DTEF-1B over a 69 nucleotide segment that includes the C-terminal portion of the TEA domain (Fig. 1D). In all other regions these isoforms are identical in nucleotide sequence indicating that they are products of a single alternatively spliced gene. The DTEF-1B TEA domain is identical to all other published vertebrate TEA domains except that of DTEF-1A (Fig. 1C). DTEF-1A, on the other hand, represents the first divergent vertebrate TEA domain protein due to the presence of a lysine at position 87 where an arginine is in human-N, mouse-N, chick-N, chick-R, Drosophila, and Aspergillus TEA domains. Similarly all known TEA domain genes encode an isoleucine at position 94 except for chick DTEF-1A and Aspergillus abaA which code for a similarly aliphatic leucine at that position. The divergent region of DTEF-1A encompasses the predicted third helix of the TEA DNA binding domain. This helix was shown to be important in sequence-specific recognition of SV40 M-CAT-like elements by human NTEF-1, but complete disruption of its tertiary structure by proline substitutions, where the rest of the protein was intact, did not completely abolish binding capacity(16.Hwang J.J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Google Scholar). The first helix (where Drosophila scalloped differs from N, R, and DTEF-1) appeared to be the most important for sequence-specific DNA recognition(16.Hwang J.J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Google Scholar). Further deletion analysis of human NTEF-1 established that portions of the C terminus of the protein are also involved in modulation of DNA binding(16.Hwang J.J. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2337-2348Google Scholar). Thus, it is impossible to predict, at present, how the amino acid substitutions and the sequence differences in the C terminus of the DTEF-1 TEA domain might affect the sequence-specificity of DNA binding. We show here that DTEF-1A is capable of sequence-specific binding to a canonical M-CAT motif, but its relative affinity for the wide range of M-CAT element variants found in cardiac and other promoters, compared to other TEF-1 family members, remains to be tested. NTEF-1 transcripts are widely expressed in human, mouse and chick tissues. RTEF-1 transcripts are also widely expressed; being enriched in skeletal and cardiac muscle and less abundant in gizzard, brain, and liver. By contrast, DTEF-1 transcripts are most highly abundant in heart muscle; at intermediate levels in lung and gizzard; and minimal or undetectable levels in skeletal muscle, kidney, liver and brain. The selective enrichment of DTEF-1 mRNA in heart and the demonstration that DTEF-1 is a sequence-specific M-CAT binding factor suggests a potential role for DTEF-1 in cardiac-specific muscle gene regulation that may differ from that played by other TEF-1 family members. M-CAT elements were first described in the cardiac-specific cTNT promoter (8.Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6404-6408Google Scholar) and since then most characterized cardiac promoters have been found to contain one or more functional M-CAT elements(9.Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Google Scholar, 10.Shimizu N. Dizon E. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 619-630Google Scholar, 11.Parmacek M.S. Vora A.J. Shen T. Barr E. Jung F. Leiden J.M. Mol. Cell.

Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Google Scholar). M-CAT elements in the promoters of the β-myosin heavy chain and α-skeletal actin genes have been shown to be required for induction by α1-adrenergic agonists and protein kinase C(28.Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Google Scholar, 29.Karnes L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Google Scholar). Several candidate protein kinase C sites can be identified in the derived amino acid sequence of DTEF-1, including residues 81, 86, 219, 329, and 398. These potential protein kinase C sites are conserved in avian NTEF-1 and RTEF-1 and mammalian NTEF-1, consistent with evolutionary conservation of potentially important regulatory sites. Since DTEF-1 is abundantly expressed in heart it may be a target for this protein kinase C regulation and a potential mediator of the α1-adrenergic hypertrophy response. The fact that this multigene family consists of at least four genes with each gene encoding multiple, alternatively spliced isoforms implies complex variability in the regulatory functions associated with the TEF-1 family. This is remniscient of the MEF-2 and bHLH families of transcription factors whose members exhibit distinct spatiotemporal patterns of expression, functional redundancy, and differentially contribute to specific gene regulatory mechanisms. Members of the TEF-1 gene family may also show functional redundancy. Disruption of the murine NTEF-1 gene, for example, results in embryonic lethality by day 11.5 (24.Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Google Scholar) by which time the forming heart tube is grossly normal. Histological analysis of mutant embryo hearts shows hypoplastic ventricles with reduced trabeculation and evidence of myocyte degeneration subjacent to the endocardium. These findings suggest a possible role for NTEF-1 in the growth and maintenance of the cardiac phenotype, but are less consistent with a role in the initiation of cardiogenesis. However, the expression of at least two other TEF-1 gene family members in the heart (RTEF-1 and DTEF-1) may be sufficient to compensate for the absence of the NTEF-1 gene products. Furthermore, the expression of other members of the TEF-1 multigene family may explain why M-CAT-dependent transcription of genes for cardiac proteins (cTNT, cTNC, myosins) is maintained in the TEF-1 knockout mutant embryos(24.Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Google Scholar). It will be interesting to see what effects transgenic knockout of the mouse DTEF-1 and RTEF-1 homologues have upon cardiac and skeletal muscle development. We would like to thank P. Chambon and I. Davidson for generously sharing the original DNA probes for NTEF-1. We also thank Reid Thompson, Paul Simpson, and Jeffrey Winkles for sharing unpublished sequence information about TEF-1 variants.

https://openalex.org/W2040586306,"Abstract Three proximal regulatory elements, AIB, AIC, and AID, of the apoA-I gene are necessary and sufficient for its hepatic expression in vivo and in vitro. DNA binding and competition assays showed that elements AIB and AID contain hormone response elements composed of imperfect direct repeats that support the binding of the hepatic nuclear factor-4, other nuclear orphan receptors, and the ligand-dependent nuclear receptors retinoic X receptor (RXRα), RXRα/RARα, and RXRα/TRβ. Substitution mutations on repeats 1 and 2 in the hormone response sites of elements AIB and AID, respectively, abolished the binding of all nuclear receptors and reduced promoter activity to background levels, indicating the importance of both hormone response elements for the hepatic expression of the apoA-I gene. Cotransfection experiments in HepG2 cells with normal and mutated promoter constructs and plasmids expressing nuclear hormone receptors showed that RXRα homodimers transactivated the wild type promoter 150% of control, in the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid (RA), whereas RXRα/TRβ heterodimers repressed transcription to 60% of control, in the presence of T. RXRα/RARα and hepatic nuclear factor-4 did not affect the transcription, driven by the proximal apoA-I promoter. Potassium permanganate and dimethyl sulfate interference experiments showed that RXRα homodimers, RXRα/RARα, and RXRα/TRβ heterodimers participate in protein-DNA interactions with 12, 13, and 11 out of the 14 nucleotides, respectively, that span repeats 1 and 2 and the spacer region separating them on the hormone response element of element AID. The binding of RXRα homodimers and RXRα/TRβ heterodimers is associated with ligand-dependent activation by 9-cis-RA or repression by T. Upon deletion or mutation of repeat 1, homodimeric binding of RXRα is lost whereas heterodimeric binding is retained. This heterodimeric binding to the mutated element AID is mediated solely by interactions with repeat 2 and one adjacent nucleotide and is confined to a heptameric core recognition motif. The interactions of the RXRα heterodimers with repeat 2 are associated with low levels of ligand-independent transcriptional activity. The findings suggest that the specific types of homo- and heterodimers of nuclear hormone receptors occupying the hormone response elements of apoA-I and the availability of the ligand may play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the human apoA-I gene."

Sensitivity of plectin kinase activity to the inhibitor olomoucine, and two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping of plectin phosphorylated by various kinase preparations suggested that the major plectin kinase activity in mitotic extracts is related to the cell cycle regulator kinase p34cdc2.

A. 1991; 88: 3812-3816Google Scholar). In vitro studies demonstrated that plectin's capacity to bind to IF proteins, such as vimentin and lamin B, were differentially influenced by phosphorylation(8.Foisner R. Traub P. Wiche G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3812-3816Google Scholar), suggesting that distinct protein kinases were involved in regulating at least some of plectin's interactions. In view of plectin's proposed role as a cytoplasmic cross-linking element, a specific regulation of its binding activities would seem of particular importance during mitosis, when dramatic structural rearrangements of the cytoskeleton, including IF networks, take place. In fact, two of plectin's well characterized binding partners, vimentin and lamin B, have been shown to act as direct targets of mitotic cyclin-dependent p34cdc2 kinase. Phosphorylation of vimentin subunits by p34cdc2 kinase at the onset of mitosis has been shown to correlate with the disassembly of the vimentin network(9.Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D.

We report here that plectin, too, serves as specific substrate of p34cdc2 kinase, and we show that a single threonine residue residing in the C-terminal globular domain serves as a target site. Chinese hamster ovary cells (clone CHO K1) were grown to a density of about 80% in plastic culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies, Inc., Paisley, United Kingdom) and 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For synchronization cells were arrested at G1/S by an overnight incubation in the presence of 2 mM thymidine (15.Terasima T. Tolmach L.J. Exp.

To obtain mitotic cells, they were released from the thymidine block for 3 h in complete S-MEM and allowed to grow for another 4 h in S-MEM containing 0.2 μg/ml nocodazole. For cells enriched in S phase, the cultures were released from the thymidine block in complete S-MEM for 4 h. Cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and metabolically labeled with 0.2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (carrier-free, DuPont NEN, Dreieich, Germany) in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 25 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, and 10% FCS dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH7.4 for 2 h. Nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells were harvested by mechanical agitation; cells still attached after nocodazole treatment (mainly in G2 phase), as well as cells in S phase were scraped off. Interphase cell pellets from one 75-cm2 Petri dish or mitotic cell pellets collected from three Petri dishes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and dissolved in 300 μl of buffer A (50 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with (i) protease inhibitors: PMSF (1 mM), benzamidine (10 mM), aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml); (ii) phosphatase inhibitors: microystin (10 μM), okadaic acid (1 μM), calyculin (100 nM) (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), NaF (10 mM), sodium pyrophosphate (10 mM), β-glycerophosphate (5 mM), and sodium orthovanadate (1 mM); and (iii) kinase inhibitors: 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7, 300 μM) and staurosporine (2 μM) (both from Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Lysates were incubated with 500 μg/ml DNase and 200 μg/ml RNase (both from Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min, and 30 μl of 10 × RIPA buffer (1 × RIPA: 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA) and 1% SDS were added. After addition of 1.5 ml of 1 × RIPA buffer samples were processed for immunoprecipitation. Part of the cell lysates were mixed with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation 1 ml of each cell lysate in RIPA buffer was incubated with 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Brussels, Belgium; 10% (w/v) in RIPA buffer) for 1 h, centrifuged for 1-2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge, and supernatants incubated overnight with 10 μl of antiserum to plectin (17.Wiche G. Baker M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 138: 15-29Google Scholar) at 4°C. 100 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose were added to each sample and incubated for another 4 h. After a 5-min centrifugation, the pellets were washed three times in RIPA buffer plus 0.1% SDS and dissolved in electrophoresis sample buffer. Nocodazole-arrested CHO cells (grown in four 900-cm2 roller bottles) or S phase cells (grown in one roller bottle) were collected and lysed in 1 ml of buffer A (containing protease inhibitor mixture) by 3 × 10-s Ultra-turrax treatment at maximum speed. The lysates were incubated with 50 μg/ml DNase and 20 μg/ml RNase for 10 min and centrifuged for 20 min at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman 65 rotor (Beckman Instruments Inc. Palo Alto, CA). Mitotic and interphase cell lysates were diluted to the same protein concentration, mixed with 16% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cdk type kinases were isolated from the cell lysate supernatants by incubation with 100 μl of p13-Sepharose beads (18.Brizuela L. Draetta G. Beach D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3507-3514Google Scholar) overnight at 4°C. The beads were sedimented, washed in kinase buffer (20 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM MgCl2) and frozen in the same buffer, containing 16% glycerol. For the preparation of the p34cdc2 kinase, 1 ml of mitotic cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of 10 × RIPA buffer plus 0.1% SDS, and incubated overnight at 4°C with 20 μl of a rabbit antiserum generated against a synthetic peptide representing the C terminus of human p34cdc2 kinase (kindly provided by L. Gerace). The immunocomplex was precipitated by a 2-h incubation with 200 μl of 10% protein A-Sepharose, washed in kinase buffer, and frozen in this buffer plus 16% glycerol. To obtain cDNA inserts for the plasmids pNM1, pNM2, pNM4, pNM5, pTH4, pTF15, and pTH6, PCR under standard conditions (19.Saiki R. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Google Scholar) was performed using plasmid pAD14 (5.Wiche G. Gromov D. Donovan A. Castanon M.J. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 607-619Google Scholar) as template. Primers were constructed in such a way that the 5′ primer carried an additional EcoRI site, and the 3′ primer an additional XbaI site, to facilitate site-directed cloning. PCR products were cloned into the pMAL-c expression vector (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA). The plectin coordinates given in Fig. 3 are based on the numbering according to a revised rat plectin sequence (data not shown), in which a new translation start codon has been identified (1635 bp upstream of the originally published ATG; (2.Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Google Scholar)). pTH1 was constructed by cloning a cDNA insert, covering the region from the new ATG to bp 3384, into pMAL-c; for pNM9 a cDNA insert, covering the N-terminal region from bp 1636 to 3384, was used. To obtain pNM10, a 5800-bp NdeI/XhoI fragment of pTH4, containing 2550 bp encoding repeats 4 and 5 and part of repeat 6, was ligated to a 3047-bp NdeI/XhoI fragment of pNM2 encoding 483 bp of the end of repeat 6 and the tail domain. To change the threonine in position 4542 to an isoleucine, the method of gene splicing by overlap extension (20.Horton R. Hunt H. Ho S. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Google Scholar) was adopted using pAD14 as template and internal primers that contained an ATA instead of an ACA codon. The final PCR product corresponding to part of repeat 6 cDNA (bp 4368-4597) was cloned into pMAL-c, giving rise to pNM6. To obtain pNM7, encoding mutagenized repeat 6 as a whole, a 2654-bp SacII/NdeI fragment of pNM 1 (62 bp of which encode the 5′ end of repeat 6) was ligated to a 4381-bp fragment of pNM6 (containing 825 bp of mutagenized repeat 6 cDNA). Two bacterial expression systems were used, pMAL-c (New England Biolabs) and pIMS (21.Simon M. Mutzel R. Mutzel H. Veron M. Plasmid. 1988; 19: 94-102Google Scholar). pMAL-c vector constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli strain HB 101. Expression was induced in cultures grown to the end of the logarithmic phase for 2 h with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and lysed in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 M NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2% Tween 20, 10 mM benzamidine, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, by sonication. Overexpressed fusion proteins were purified on amylose columns (New England Biolabs) as described by the manufacturer. pIMS cDNA constructs encoding mutant proteins corresponding to clones C1 and C2 combined, C5 and C3 (described in (2.Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Google Scholar)) were expressed in E. coli strain XL-1 blue (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) as described(2.Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Google Scholar). Cell pellets, frozen in liquid nitrogen, were ground in a mortar in the presence of 30 mg of solid lysozyme (Sigma) per gram of wet cells and homogenized for 10 min in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline plus 100 mM MgCl2, 50 μg/ml DNase, and 20 μg/ml RNase using a glass/glass homogenizer. After addition of 600 mM NaCl, 8 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% Triton X-100, inclusion bodies with the overexpressed proteins were collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 19,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor and solubilized in 10 volumes (w/v) of 50 mM sodium borate, pH 8.7, 0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate, 5 mM EDTA, 4 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM PMSF. Solubilized proteins were subjected to Sephacryl S-300 gel permeation column chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Plectin was purified from rat glioma C6 cells as described elsewhere(1.Foisner R. Wiche G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 515-531Google Scholar). 30 μl of the plectin sample (0.1-0.2 mg/ml 10 mM sodium borate/NaOH, pH 8.9, 1 mM PMSF), or 10 μg histone H1 (Boehringer), or 30 μl of E. coli lysates (containing the mutant proteins) were mixed with 5 μl of total cell extracts, or 5 μl of immunoprecipitated or p13 affinity-purified p34cdc2 kinase fractions, and 5 μl of 10 × kinase buffer, supplemented with 10 μM microcystin and protease inhibitor mixture. The phosphorylation reaction, started by adding 50 μM ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, was carried out for 30-90 min at 30°C, and stopped by adding 3 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer(16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Phosphorylation with protein kinase A and protein kinase C was done as described elsewhere(8.Foisner R. Traub P. Wiche G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3812-3816Google Scholar). To inhibit p34cdc2 kinase activity, 0.5 mM olomoucine (Promega Corp., Madison, WI; (22.Vesely J. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Blow J.J. Donella-Deana A. Pinna L. Letham D.S. Kato J. Detivaud L. Leclerc S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 771-786Google Scholar)) were added to the incubation mixture. Phosphorylated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and processed according to (23.Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Google Scholar), except that gel pieces containing the protein (prepared as described in (14.Dessev G. Iovcheva-Dessev C. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 523-533Google Scholar)) were used for trypsin digestion. To analyze plectin kinase activities at different stages of the cell cycle, we prepared total cell lysates from CHO cell cultures enriched in mitotic cells (mitotic index > 90%), or from cultures predominantly containing cells in S or in G2 phase. Kinase activities were analyzed using purified plectin and histone H1 as in vitro substrates (Fig. 1A, Cell Lysates). Unlike histone H1 (Fig. 1A, lower panels), plectin was phosphorylated by kinases contained in all three cell lysates to a similar extent (Fig. 1A, upper panels), suggesting that plectin served as substrate for these protein kinases throughout the cell cycle. Control experiments performed in the absence of exogenous plectin (Fig. 1, Control) showed that endogenous plectin was not detectable in autoradiographs. The high level of histone H1 kinase activity in mitotic cell lysates further suggested that the mitotically active Cdk, p34cdc2 kinase, was one of the major kinase activities present in this lysate. To investigate whether p34cdc2 kinase was able to phosphorylate plectin directly, the kinase was immunoprecipitated from mitotic and interphase cell lysates and its activity tested using plectin and histone H1 as substrates. The kinase immunoprecipitated from mitotic cell lysates showed a high histone H1 kinase activity, and, unlike kinases immunoprecipitated from S phase cell lysates and mock-precipitated samples, it phosphorylated plectin to a relatively high extent (~1 mol of phosphate/mol of plectin) (Fig. 1A, Immunoprecipitates; and data not shown). Samples immunoprecipitated from G2 phase lysates also showed histone H1 and plectin kinase activities, probably due to remnants of mitotic cells in the preparation. Significant phosphorylation of both plectin and histone H1 was observed also with protein kinase preparations obtained from mitotic cell lysates by affinity purification on immobilized p13suc1 (Fig. 1A, p13suc1). These experiments suggested that plectin can serve as a direct in vitro substrate for mitotic p34cdc2 kinase. In contrast to immunoprecipitated samples, such activities were contained also in p13suc1 purified kinase preparation from S phase cells, indicating that non-mitotic Cdk kinases distinct from p34cdc2 might also phosphorylate these proteins (Fig. 1A, p13suc1). The plectin and histone H1 kinase activities of immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1B, cdc2) as well as p13suc1-precipitated kinases (Fig. 1B, p13) were significantly reduced in the presence of olomoucine, an inhibitor specific for Cdk-type kinases. Activities of protein kinase A and protein kinase C were much less affected by this inhibitor (Fig. 1B, PKA and PKC), confirming that the isolated mitotic plectin kinase activity represented genuine p34cdc2 kinase. To examine whether plectin became phosphorylated at similar sites in vivo and in vitro, two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping was performed. Two of the spots generated from plectin immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled mitotic CHO cells (Fig. 2, panel 3, spots a and b) were also seen in plectin phosphorylated in vitro by kinase activities contained in the mitotic extract (Fig. 2, panel 4). This indicated that some of the in vivo target sites of mitotic kinases were recognized also in vitro. Peptide maps generated from purified rat glioma C6 cell plectin phosphorylated with purified kinases A (Fig. 2, panel 1) or C (Fig. 2, panel 2) showed different patterns, suggesting that these kinases mainly affected plectin sites that were not phosphorylated by mitotic kinases under in vivo conditions; furthermore, mitotic cell lysates apparently did not contain any activities related to kinases A and C. Purified C6 cell plectin phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated p34cdc2 kinase revealed two major peptides, a and b (Fig. 2, panel 5), both of which comigrated with the major spots generated from samples phosphorylated by mitotic extracts (Fig. 2, panel 6). This strongly suggested that plectin is a prominent target of p34cdc2 kinase contained in mitotic cell lysates. Furthermore, since these two major phosphopeptides were also present in digests of mitotic samples labeled in vivo (Fig. 2, panel 3, spots a and b; and data not shown), we concluded that purified p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylated plectin in vitro at sites, which are similar to those targeted in vivo. The consensus p34cdc2 recognition motif (S/T)-P-X-(K/R) (24.Nigg E. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 296-301Google Scholar) can be found twice in plectin's polypeptide chain ((2.Wiche G. Becker B. Luber K. Weitzer G. Castanon M.J. Hauptmann R. Stratowa C. Stewart M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 83-99Google Scholar) and data not shown). One of the sites (SPAK) is located in the rod-domain, the other (TPGR) in repeat 6 of the C-terminal globular domain; in addition, repeat 6 contains a slightly degenerate motif (SPYS) (Fig. 3). To map the p34cdc2-specific phosphorylation site(s), recombinant plectin mutant proteins, corresponding to different domains of the molecule (Fig. 3), were expressed in bacteria and used as in vitro substrates for the kinase. It was found that only those mutant peptides that contained repeat 6 and/or the C-terminal tail domain were phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (Fig. 3 and 4). Mutant peptides containing the N-terminal region, plectin's rod domain, or the first three repeats of the C-terminal domain were not recognized by p34cdc2 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). To address the question why the tail domain served as a good substrate for p34cdc2 kinase, even though it did not contain a consensus recognition sequence motif, two-dimensional peptide mapping was performed. Spots a and b, seen in the phosphopeptide pattern of the intact molecule after p34cdc2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5, panel 1), were missing in the peptide map derived from the mutant protein containing just the tail domain (pTH6). However, in the latter case numerous additional peptides appeared instead, which were not part of the pattern observed with the whole molecule (Fig. 5, panels 2 and 3). This suggested that the phosphorylation sites in the tail region were not accessible to the kinase in the intact molecule and therefore did not constitute native target sites. When the mutant protein encoded by pNM10 (containing repeats 4-6 and the tail) was subjected to two-dimensional peptide mapping, one of the spots appeared to comigrate with peptide a, seen in intact plectin, while several other spots, not seen with the whole protein (Fig. 5, panels 4 and 6), seemed to be derived from the tail domain (Fig. 5, panel 5). Since repeats 4 and 5 were not phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase (Fig. 4) and the tail showed a different pattern compared to intact plectin, the p34cdc2 site corresponding to spot a was likely to represent a site within repeat 6. Peptide b, derived from intact plectin, however, was not detected in the tryptic peptide maps of any of the bacterially expressed mutant proteins, which served as substrates for p34cdc2.Figure 5:Tryptic peptide maps (autoradiography) of plectin and recombinant plectin mutant proteins phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase. Panels 1 and 4, plectin purified from rat glioma C6 cells; panel 2, pTH6-encoded mutant protein; panel 3, mixture of samples shown in panels 1 and 2; panel 5, pNM10-encoded mutant protein; panel 6, mixture of samples shown in panels 4 and 5. Phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis (bottom, +; top, -) and chromatography (right to left), with the starting points in the lower right-hand corners. Letters indicate the corresponding spots on autoradiographs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Experiments using mutant proteins representing truncated versions of repeat 6, containing either one of the two p34cdc2 recognition motifs identified (Fig. 3, pNM4 and pNM5), showed that only the polypeptide encoded by pNM4, containing the recognition motif TPGR, served as a target for p34cdc2 kinase (Fig. 6, cdc2 kinase, lanes 2 and 4). Site-directed mutagenesis of the threonine within the recognition motif to isoleucine, led to a mutant protein that was no longer phosphorylated upon incubation with p34cdc2 kinase (Fig. 6). Protein kinase A phosphorylated mutant proteins encoded by pWEI2, pWEI3, pNM1, pNM2, and pTH6 at target sites residing in repeat 3, repeat 6, and the tail (Fig. 3), whereas protein kinase C recognized only a mutant protein corresponding to repeat 5 (encoded by pTH5; Figure 3:, Figure 4:, lane 3). Since kinase A and p34cdc2 kinase both phosphorylated plectin within the repeat 6 domain, it was of interest to test whether they targeted the same sites. A comparison of two-dimensional peptide maps generated from total plectin phosphorylated by p34cdc2 (Fig. 7, panel 2) or protein kinase A (Fig. 7, panel 1), revealed that none of the kinase A-specific spots, were comigrating with the p34cdc2-specific peptides a and b (Fig. 7, panel 3). Repeat 6 phosphorylated by protein kinase A gave rise to three spots (Fig. 7, panel 4, spots f-h), which were also seen in total plectin after phosphorylation with kinase A, but were clearly different from the p34cdc2-specific spot a. In support of this, the pNM6-encoded mutant protein, containing an isoleucine instead of a threonine at the TPGR sequence motif of repeat 6, continued to be a good substrate for protein kinase A (Fig. 6); furthermore, the two-dimensional peptide map of this mutated protein was indistinguishable from that of unmutated repeat 6, encoded by pNM1 (Fig. 7, panels 4 and 5). In this work we demonstrate that plectin is phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated p34cdc2 kinase at a unique site in its C-terminal domain. Although one cannot completely eliminate the possibility that the purified immunoprecipitated p34cdc2 kinase used in this study contained minor contaminations of coprecipitating kinases, for various reasons it is very likely that p34cdc2 kinase activity is responsible for the phosphorylation of plectin in our assays. 1) Immunoprecipitation of p34cdc2 kinase was performed under stringent conditions (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100) using antibodies directed against a C-terminal amino acid sequence unique for p34cdc2; mock-precipitated samples using unspecific antibodies did not exhibit any kinase activity. 2) Immunoprecipitated p34cdc2 kinase samples showed high H1 kinase activities and, unlike protein kinases A and C, were efficiently inhibited by the specific inhibitor olomoucine (Fig. 1). 3) Immunoprecipitation from interphase cell extracts did not yield histone H1 nor plectin kinase activities (Fig. 1), being consistent with the presence of inactive p34cdc2 kinase during interphase. 4) Mutation (Thr → Ile) of a potential p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site within the repeat 6 domain of plectin diminished its phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase, but not by protein kinase A (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Figure 5:, Figure 6:). 5) p34cdc2 kinase prepared by affinity chromatography on p13suc1-Sepharose or by ion exchange chromatography on DE-52 columns phosphorylated plectin at the same sites as immunoprecipitated kinase (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Comparison of phosphopeptide maps generated from samples phosphorylated in vitro using mitotic cell lysates versus purified p34cdc2 kinase suggested the major sites phosphorylated to be the same in both cases. Thus, p34cdc2 kinase seems to represent the main activity among all plectin kinase activities present in mitotic cell extracts. The phosphorylation sites recognized by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro are likely to represent genuine physiological targets, since the same sites were phosphorylated in vivo. The majority of phosphorylation sites affected by kinases C and A, on the other hand, were not detected in samples phosphorylated in vivo, nor in plectin phosphorylated by mitotic extracts, indicating that these kinases were not activated during the normal growth and division cycle of CHO cells. The phosphopeptide pattern of purified plectin after p34cdc2 kinase-treatment revealed two different spots (a and b), indicating two different phosphorylated sites. To map these sites, we used the bacterial expression system pMAL-c, in which the recombinant peptide is expressed fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP). The relative large size of the MBP (~40 kDa) was shown to have no effect on the ability of the recombinant proteins to serve as substrates for various kinases, because proteins without MBP (after cleavage with factor Xa) behaved in the same way. Of all the different plectin domains tested, only the C-terminal part of the molecule, containing repeat 6 and/or the 3′ tail domain, proved to be phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase. When tested without the repeat 6 domain, the tail showed by far a stronger signal and became the first candidate for closer investigations. Even though it did not contain any of the reported p34cdc2 consensus motifs(24.Nigg E. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 296-301Google Scholar), it had numerous phosphate accepting residues (21 serines and 5 threonines). However, when the phosphopeptide pattern derived from the tail was compared to that of the intact full-length protein, it turned out that none of the phosphopeptides from one source had a matching counterpart in the other. The reason why the tail, when part of the whole molecule, was not phosphorylated, despite constituting such a good in vitro substrate, probably was limited accessibility in the native molecule. This assumption was corroborated by the observation that in larger mutant proteins, containing the tail and several of the preceding repeat domains, tail-specific phosphorylation decreased and phosphopeptide patterns resembled that of the full-length protein. The finding that repeat 6, but not the tail domain, seemed to be the natural target of p34cdc2 kinase was consistent with the fact that the only perfect p34cdc2 consensus sequence motif found in the C-terminal domain resided within repeat 6. Deletion and site-specific mutagenesis confirmed this site as a phosphoacceptor of p34cdc2 kinase. The localization of a second phosphorylation site, suggested by the appearance of peptide b in tryptic peptide maps of intact plectin, is not clear, since none of the recombinant plectin domains, which were able to serve as substrate for p34cdc2 kinase in vitro, revealed this spot in two-dimensional phosphopeptide analysis. This discrepancy could be explained in two ways. 1) There is in fact only one site and the digest of the total plectin molecule may have been incomplete, so that the second spot would represent a peptide phosphorylated at the same site but migrating to a different position because of its larger size. 2) The phosphorylation of the second site might be dependent on post-translational modifications of the protein, which would not occur in the bacterially expressed proteins, but could be relevant for plectin purified from rat glioma C6 cells. The situation that a protein like plectin, containing an α-helical double-stranded coiled-coil rod domain flanked by globular domains, is preferentially phosphorylated by p34cdc2 kinase in the presumably less ordered domains adjacent to its rod applies also to the IF proteins lamin (12.Heald R. McKeon F. Cell. 1990; 61: 579-589Google Scholar, 25.Ward G.E. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 561-577Google Scholar) and vimentin(10.Tsujimura K. Ogawara M. Takeuchi Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ha M. Inagaki M.

Since their phosphorylation by p34cdc2 kinase has been implicated in the regulation of filament structure and assembly state, it remains an intriguing question to what extent plectin's structure and functions are influenced by p34cdc2 phosphorylation. We thank Larry Gerace (Scripps Clinic Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) for donating antiserum to p34cdc2 kinase and Heribert Hirt (University of Vienna), for providing a bacterial strain overproducing p13suc1."
https://openalex.org/W2034345578,"Insulin stimulates the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway leading to feedback phosphorylation of the Ras guanylnucleotide exchange protein SOS and dissociation of Grb2 from SOS. Even though epidermal growth factor (EGF) also stimulates ERK activity and phosphorylation of SOS similar to insulin, EGF induces a dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex from Shc. To determine the molecular basis for this difference, we examined the signaling properties of a mutant EGF receptor lacking the five major autophosphorylation sites. Although EGF stimulation of the mutant EGF receptor activates ERK and phosphorylation of both Shc and SOS, it fails to directly associate with either Shc or Grb2. However, under these conditions EGF induces a dissociation of the Grb2-SOS complex suggesting a role for receptor and/or plasma membrane targeting in the stabilization of Grb2-SOS interaction. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of an SH2 domain Grb2 mutant which is unable to mediate plasma membrane targeting of the Grb2-SOS complex results in both insulin- and EGF-stimulated uncoupling of Grb2 from SOS. Furthermore, a plasma membrane-bound Grb2 fusion protein remains constitutively associated with SOS. Together, these data demonstrate that EGF stimulation prevents the feedback uncoupling of Grb2 from SOS by inducing a persistent plasma membrane receptor targeting of the Grb2-SOS complex."
https://openalex.org/W2036409857,"In this study we have examined the role of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) in the differentiation of the CaCo-2 human colon carcinoma cell line. We have shown previously that IGF-II is an autocrine growth factor for CaCo-2 cells. IGF-II expression is high in proliferating, undifferentiated CaCo-2 cells and markedly decreases when cells become confluent and start to differentiate. To evaluate whether differentiation of CaCo-2 cells depends on an IGF-II related pathway, we treated cells with a blocking antibody to the IGF-I receptor that mediates most IGF-II biological effects. Treatment of preconfluent CaCo-2 cells with this antibody decreased by 40% autonomous cell proliferation and induced differentiation as shown by an increase in sucrase isomaltase activity and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) mRNA levels. To examine the significance of autocrine IGF-II production in CaCo-2 cell differentiation, we generated stable CaCo-2 cell lines that constitutively express rat IGF-II under the control of a Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Sustained expression of IGF-II resulted in: (a) increased proliferative rate; (b) high IGF-I receptor number, even after reaching confluence; (c) increased capability of anchorage-independent growth; (d) inhibition of the expression of apoA-I and SI mRNAs. Analysis of several independent IGF-II-transfected clones showed an inverse correlation between IGF-II mRNA levels and expression of the differentiation markers, the cells expressing the higher levels of the transfected IGF-II being the less differentiated ones.

https://openalex.org/W2046968871,"We examined the effects of the Gly-60 to Ala mutation on the interaction of H-Ras with Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromin 1 (NF1), Raf-1, and ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (ralGDS), factors that interact with GTP-bound form of H-Ras. Previous study has shown that the G60A mutation perturbs GTP-induced conformational changes of H-Ras. We found that the G60A mutation decreases GTPase activity of H-Ras without significantly affecting GTP/GDP binding. The reduction in GTPase activity is most dramatic in the presence of GAP or NF1. Interestingly, the G60A mutation does not appear to alter the affinity of H-Ras for GAP or NF1. The G60A mutation moderately reduces the binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 Ras binding domain; however, the binding of H-Ras to ralGDS Ras binding domain was more significantly affected by the same mutation. These results indicate that although GAP, NF1, Raf-1, and ralGDS all interact with H-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and they are able to compete against each other for binding to H-Ras, these factors share overlapping but not identical binding domains on H-Ras. The significance of our findings is discussed in the light of the GTP-induced conformational change model. We examined the effects of the Gly-60 to Ala mutation on the interaction of H-Ras with Ras GTPase activating protein (GAP), neurofibromin 1 (NF1), Raf-1, and ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (ralGDS), factors that interact with GTP-bound form of H-Ras. Previous study has shown that the G60A mutation perturbs GTP-induced conformational changes of H-Ras. We found that the G60A mutation decreases GTPase activity of H-Ras without significantly affecting GTP/GDP binding. The reduction in GTPase activity is most dramatic in the presence of GAP or NF1. Interestingly, the G60A mutation does not appear to alter the affinity of H-Ras for GAP or NF1. The G60A mutation moderately reduces the binding of H-Ras to Raf-1 Ras binding domain; however, the binding of H-Ras to ralGDS Ras binding domain was more significantly affected by the same mutation.

https://openalex.org/W2088015289,"The mammalian ftz-f1 (mftz-f1) gene encoding Ad4BP/SF-1 has been demonstrated to be essential for the development of adrenal and gonadal glands. In a previous study, we identified an E box as the transcriptional element in the 5′-upstream region of the rat mftz-f1 gene. In the present study, we found a steroidogenic cell-specific transcriptional element in the first intron of the gene. Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprint analyses clearly revealed that Ad4BP itself binds to the element (Ad4 site). This finding was further supported by the positive effect of an Ad4BP expression vector on the transcription and by the significant decrease in the transcription caused by nucleotide substitutions within the Ad4 site. Similar loss was also caused by substitutions in the E box, indicating that the two elements are essential for the full transcriptional activity of the gene. DNase I hypersensitivity assays revealed that the chromatin structure around the Ad4 site and the E box was #x0201C;open up” in the adrenal glands and Y-1 cells, whereas #x0201C;closed down” in the liver. These observations indicated that the mftz-f1 gene is controlled by the autoregulatory loop in the steroidogenic tissues. The autoregulatory mechanism seems to be necessary to keep the mftz-f1 gene activated and thus maintain the tissues differentiated.

These observations indicated that the mftz-f1 gene is controlled by the autoregulatory loop in the steroidogenic tissues. The autoregulatory mechanism seems to be necessary to keep the mftz-f1 gene activated and thus maintain the tissues differentiated. Ad4BP (or SF-1) was identified as a tissue-specific transcription factor that regulates all the steroidogenic P-450 genes in the adrenal cortex and gonads(1.Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Google Scholar, 2.Lala D.S. Rice D.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1249-1258Google Scholar). Analyses of the cDNA clone encoding Ad4BP revealed that the factor is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily(3.Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Google Scholar), in which all the members have a zinc finger motif as the DNA binding domain(4.Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar). A functional study using an expression vector for Ad4BP confirmed that the transcription factor governs the tissue-specific expression of the steroidogenic P-450 genes(5.Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar). Recently, wider functions of Ad4BP in addition to the regulation of the steroidogenic P-450 genes has been shown by the following investigations. The expression of Ad4BP was examined immunohistochemically using the specific antiserum (6.Morohashi K. Iida H. Nomura M. Hatano O. Honda S. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Hara T. Takakusu A. Shibata Y. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 643-653Google Scholar) and in situ hybridization(7.Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in the regulation of the steroidogenic P-450 genes, Ad4BP was confirmed to be expressed in the steroidogenic cells of the adrenal gland and gonads. In addition, Ad4BP was found to be expressed in the pituitary gonadotroph, which secretes follicule-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, as well as in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus(8.Ingraham H.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Shen W.-H. Nachtigal M.W. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2302-2312Google Scholar, 9.Ikeda Y. Luo X. Abbud R. Nilson J.H. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 478-486Google Scholar, 10.Shinoda K. Lei H. Yoshii H. Nomura M. Nagano M. Shiba H. Sasaki H. Osawa Y. Ninomiya Y. Niwa O. Morohashi K. Li E. Dev. Dynam. 1995; 204: 22-29Google Scholar), which controls female sexual behavior(11.Cohen R.S. Pfaff D.W. Prog. Neurobiol. 1992; 38: 423-453Google Scholar). Considering the physiological functions of those tissues, it is clear that Ad4BP is one of the essential factors which control the reproductive function of animals, although the genes controlled by Ad4BP in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus still remain to be clarified. Further investigation of the developing tissues revealed that Ad4BP is expressed even in the primordial cells of the adrenal gland and gonads of the fetuses(7.Ikeda Y. Shen W.-H. Ingraham H.A. Parker K.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 654-662Google Scholar, 12.Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Google Scholar). In the fetal gonads, a significant amount of Ad4BP was expressed in the testes, whereas only a trace amount was expressed in the ovaries. Sexual differentiation of the gonads is known to be initiated by the transient expression of SRY in the somatic cells of the urogenital ridge(13.Sinclair A.H. Palmer M.S. Berta P. Ellis N.A. Goodfellow P.N. Desjardins C. Ewing L.L. Cell and Molecular Biology of the Testis. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 43-57Google Scholar). The sexually dimorphic expression of Ad4BP observed in the differentiating gonads suggested that the mammalian ftz-f1 (mftz-f1) gene encoding Ad4BP might be one of the genes located downstream to SRY. It is likely that the gonads express the steroidogenic P-450s and Müllerian inhibitory substance in a sex-dependent manner as a consequence of the dimorphic expression of Ad4BP(12.Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Google Scholar, 14.Shen W-H. Moore C.C.D. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 651-661Google Scholar). In the adrenal glands, however, a significant amount of Ad4BP was continuously expressed throughout the life regardless of the sexes(12.Hatano O. Takayama K. Imai T. Waterman M.R. Takakusu A. Omura T. Morohashi K. Development. 1994; 120: 2787-2797Google Scholar). These postulated functions of Ad4BP have been supported by the targeted disruption of the mftz-f1 gene(10.Shinoda K. Lei H. Yoshii H. Nomura M. Nagano M. Shiba H. Sasaki H. Osawa Y. Ninomiya Y. Niwa O. Morohashi K. Li E. Dev. Dynam. 1995; 204: 22-29Google Scholar, 15.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Google Scholar, 16.Luo X. Ikeda Y. Schlosser D.A. Parker K.L. Mol.

A. 1995; 92: 10939-10943Google Scholar). Ad4BP null mice showed a complete absence of the adrenal gland and gonads, indicating that Ad4BP governs the genes essential for the adrenal and gonadal differentiation. Therefore, information about the transcriptional mechanism of the mftz-f1 gene is essential for the elucidation of the molecular basis of adrenal and gonadal differentiation. In our previous report, an E box (18.Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Google Scholar) responsible for the specific expression of the gene in the steroidogenic cells was identified in the 5′-upstream region(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused our attention on the contribution of the first intron to the gene expression and identified an Ad4 site as the transcriptional element. The function of the Ad4 site in the expression of the mftz-f1 gene clearly indicated that the gene is autoregulated by its own product, Ad4BP. As described previously (19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar), Ad4CAT2.0K and Ad4CAT0.8K contain the 2.0 and 0.8 kb ( 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobaseP-450cytochrome P-450CATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCYP11Agene encoding side-chain cleavage P-450CYP11Bgene encoding 11β-hydroxylase P-450(40.Nelson D.R.

Shichiri M. Mori M. Ebina Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1627Google Scholar). Ad4ECAT2.0K contains the 5.6-kb DNA fragment between the EcoRI site at 2.0-kb upstream region from the transcriptional initiation site and a SmaI site generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the second exon at 5 bp upstream from the initiation methionine. Ad4ECAT2.0K was employed to generate deletion constructs by either digestion or partial digestion at the restriction enzyme sites as shown in Fig. 1. For the construction of Ad4ECAT0.8K, the BamHI site at 0.8 kb upstream from the transcription initiation site was used. Ad4ECATΔ3.0K, Ad4ECATΔ2.2K, Ad4ECATΔ1.8K, Ad4ECATΔ0.8K, and Ad4ECATΔ0.4K were constructed by using the XbaI site at 3.0 kb, BamHI site at 2.2 kb, HindIII site at 1.8 kb, SacI site at 0.8 kb, and XbaI site at 0.4 kb upstream from the splice acceptor site, respectively. Ad4ECATΔHX, Ad4ECATΔBX, Ad4ECATΔXX, and Ad4ECATΔPX were obtained by internal deletions of 1.4-kb HindIII-XbaI, 1.8-kb BamHI-XbaI, 2.6-kb XbaI-XbaI, and 3.2-kb PmaCI-XbaI fragments, respectively. Ad4ECATΔXX-A75, -A24, and -A0, and -B82, -B37, -B17, and -B1 were constructed from Ad4ECATΔXX by Bal31 nuclease digestion from the XbaI site to the upstream and downstream regions, respectively. The deletion end points were determined by DNA sequencing. The numbers preceded by A and B indicate the distances from the splice donor and splice acceptor sites, respectively. Ad4CAT0.8K-EF and -ER were generated by insertion of a 91-bp genomic fragment (+146/+236) at the Eco81I site(−265) of Ad4CAT0.8K in the forward and reverse directions, respectively. pCAT-EF and -ER contained the same 91-bp fragment at the XbaI site of the pCAT plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) in the forward and reverse directions, respectively. Expression vectors for Ad4BP (RSV/Ad4BP) and luciferase (RSV/luc) which are under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus enhancer/promoter were described previously(5.Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar). An expression vector for a truncated Ad4BP, ΔAd4BP207, was described previously(3.Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Google Scholar). kilobase cytochrome P-450 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene encoding side-chain cleavage P-450 gene encoding 11β-hydroxylase P-450(40.Nelson D.R.

Ad4ECAT0.8KM carrying a four-nucleotide substitution within the E box was constructed from Ad4CATM3(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis within the first intron of the mftz-f1 gene was performed as described(21.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). In brief, the 2.8-kb long HindIII- HindIII fragment was subcloned into the HindIII site of the pUC119. Single strand DNA recovered from the above plasmid was used as the template for mutagenesis. An oligonucleotide, 5′-GAGGCCTGGGCCCCGATATTCACTTA-3′, containing the three nucleotide substitution (underlined) was used as the primer. The nucleotide substitution was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutated fragment was subcloned back to Ad4ECAT0.8K and Ad4ECAT0.8KM to generate Ad4ECAT0.8KMA and Ad4ECAT0.8KMA, respectively. Y-1 and CV-1 cells were maintained as described previously(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). Three μg of the CAT plasmids and 0.2 μg of RSV/luc were transfected into the cultured cells by lipofection. The efficiencies of the transfections were normalized by the luciferase activities derived from the RSV/luc as described(5.Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar). For the cotransfection assays, 3 μg of RSV/Ad4BP or the mock-expression plasmid, 3 μg of Ad4ECAT0.8K or Ad4ECAT0.8KA, and 0.2 μg of RSV/luc were transfected into CV-1 cells. The cells were harvested 42 h after the lipofection, and CAT assays were performed using 1-deoxy-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol, Amersham, United Kingdom). All transfection experiments were performed at least 3 times. A DNA fragment spanning from +57 bp to +316 bp was obtained by polymerase chain reaction, inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19, and digested at either the EcoRI or HindIII site of the polylinker. After end labeling with polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (222 TBq/mmol, Amersham), DNase I footprinting was performed with a nuclear extract prepared from Y-1 cells as described previously(22.Honda S. Morohashi K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 1042-1049Google Scholar). Double stranded oligonucleotides, dENC, containing the protected sequence from the DNase I digestion in the first intron (5′-gTAAGTGAAGGCCGGGGCCCAGGCCT-3′/3′-ATTCACTTCCGGCCCCGGGTCCGGAg-5′) and dAd4, containing an authentic Ad4 site in the promoter region of the bovine CYP11B (5′-ggACATACCCAAGGTCCCCTTT-3′/3′-TGTATGGGTTCCAGGGGAAAgg-5′) were used as the probes. One or two guanine nucleotides (g) were added to the 5′ end of the synthetic nucleotides and used for a labeling reaction with the Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol, Amersham). For competition assays, a 50-fold molar excess amount of the nonradiolabeled double stranded oligonucleotides, dENC, dEM1 (5′-GACTGTGAAGGCCGGGGCCCAGGCCT-3′/3′-TGACACTTCCGGCCCCGGGTCCGGAG-5′), dEM2 (5′-GTAAGCATAGGCCGGGGCCCAGGCCT-3′/3′-ATTCGTATCCGGCCCCGGGTCCGGAG-5′) or dEM3 (5′-GTAAGTGAATATCGGGGCCCAGGCCT-3′/3′-ATTCACTTATAGCCCCGGGTCCGGAG-5′), dEM4 (5′-GTAAGTGAAGGCCATAGCCCAGGCCT-3′/3′-ATTCACTTCCGGTATCGGGTCCGGAG-5′), dEM5 (5′-GTAAGTGAAGGCCGGGGATTAGGCCT-3′/3′-ATTCACTTCCGGCCCCTAATCCGGAG-5′), or dEM6 (5′-GTAAGTGAAGGCCGGGGCCCAGAAGT-3′/3′-ATTCACTTCCGGCCCCGGGTCTTCAG-5′) was added prior to the addition of the probe. In the above oligonucleotides, dEM1-M6 have a three sequential nucleotide substitution in dENC (underlined). An antiserum to Ad4BP was added after the addition of the probe. The procedure for the gel mobility shift assay was described previously(22.Honda S. Morohashi K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 1042-1049Google Scholar). DNase I hypersensitivity assay was performed on the nuclei isolated from Y-1 cells, rat adrenal glands, and a rat liver as described(23.Wu C. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 269-289Google Scholar). The nuclei (35 μg of DNA) were digested in a 100-μl reaction mixture with DNase I at concentrations of 0, 10, 25, 64, and 160 units/ml at 25°C for 6 min. Thirty-five μg of the genomic DNA purified from each of the nuclear preparations was digested to completion with HindIII and then electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel followed by Southern blotting. The 1.0-kb HindIII-PmaCI fragments from the rat and mouse mftz-f1 genes were 32P-labeled and used as the probes for the rat tissue specimens and Y-1 cells, respectively. We previously identified the E box as the transcriptional element in the 5′-upstream region of the rat mftz-f1 gene(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). In the present study, a further investigation of the gene transcription was performed with the CAT reporter gene constructs indicated in Fig. 1. Interestingly, Ad4ECAT2.0K which contains the 3.4-kb long first intron in addition to the 2.0 kb upstream from the EcoRI in the first exon showed an approximately 200-fold stronger CAT activity than Ad4CAT2.0K which lacks the first intron(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). The CAT activity of Ad4ECAT2.0K was examined in other steroidogenic I-10 testicular Leydig cells as well as non-steroidogenic CV-1 and NIH3T3 cells. The enhancement of the transcriptional activity by the first intron was observed only in the steroidogenic Y-1 and I-10 cells. Moreover, in Y-1 cells, the activity shown by Ad4ECAT2.0K was stronger than that by pSV2CAT containing an SV40 enhancer/promoter (data not shown). These results suggested the presence of a regulatory region responsible for the strong and the steroidogenic cell-specific transcription of the mftz-f1 gene in the first intron. Since Ad4ECAT2.0K contains the promoter regions and the first exons of both Ad4BP and ELP(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar), we investigated which mRNA transcribed from the CAT plasmid in Y-1 cells by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses. The amount of the ELP mRNA was significantly lower than that of Ad4BP, showing a good correlation with our previous observation (6.Morohashi K. Iida H. Nomura M. Hatano O. Honda S. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Hara T. Takakusu A. Shibata Y. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 643-653Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, the CAT activity of Ad4ECAT mostly reflects the Ad4BP promoter activity. To identify the transcriptional element in the first intron, various deletion plasmids were constructed based on Ad4ECAT2.0K as shown in Fig. 1. A drastic decrease of the CAT activity was observed when the 5′ deletion reached to the XbaI site (5′ side) (Ad4ECATΔ3.0K). Further truncations to the BamHI, HindIII, SacI, and XbaI (3′ side) sites (Ad4ECATΔ2.2K, Δ1.8K, Δ0.8K, and Δ0.4K, respectively) abolished the remaining weak CAT activity. No remarkable change in the CAT activity was observed when Ad4ECATΔHX, ΔBX, and ΔXX having internal deletions were transfected. A significant decrease was, however, observed when the internal deletion reached to −79 bp in the 5′-upstream region (Ad4ECATΔPX). The decrease seems to be due to the lack of both the first exon and the E box element, the latter of which had been identified as a transcriptional element located from −82 to −77 bp(19.Nomura M. Bärtsch S. Nawata H. Omura T. Morohashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7453-7461Google Scholar). Judging from these observations, the transcriptional element in the first intron is likely to be located from the 5′ splice junction to the XbaI site (5′ side) and/or from the XbaI site (3′ side) to the 3′ splice junction. To locate the transcriptional element more precisely, the transcriptional activities of Ad4ECATΔXX-A and -B series of the CAT plasmids were investigated. In the case of the Ad4ECATΔXX-A series, a drastic decrease of the CAT activity was observed between Ad4ECATΔXX-A24 and -A0. In the Ad4ECATΔXX-B series, on the other hand, a 3-fold increase of the CAT activity was observed when the deletion reached to 82 bp from the 3′ splice junction (Ad4ECATΔXX-B82), while a decrease of the CAT activity was observed with the plasmids from Ad4ECATΔXX-B37 to -B17. Further deletion to 1 bp (Ad4ECATΔXX-B1) abolished the CAT activity. It is widely accepted that the splice junction sequences for correct splicing require not only a GT-AG rule but a pyrimidine nucleotide cluster just upstream from the 3′ splice junction and the consensus several nucleotides at the 5′ splice junction(24.Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Google Scholar, 25.Ohshima Y. Gotoh Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 247-259Google Scholar, 26.Wieringa B. Hofer E. Weissmann C. Cell. 1984; 37: 915-925Google Scholar). Indeed, the mftz-f1 gene has a pyrimidine-rich sequence at the 3′ splice junction, (T/C)10ACAG/G, and the consensus sequence, CA/GTAAGT, at the 5′ splice junction (Fig. 2). Taking the rule into consideration, the decrease of the CAT activity between Ad4ECATΔXX-B17 and -B1 seems to be caused by the impairment of the consensus 3′ sequence. However, since it was not clear whether the decrease between Ad4ECATΔXX-B37 and -B17 resulted from the deletion of a putative transcriptional element or a decrease in the splicing efficiency, we investigated the structure of the mRNA transcribed from Ad4ECATΔXX-B17. A significant portion of the mRNA was found to be unspliced (data not shown). Accordingly, it is likely that the decrease of the CAT activity mainly resulted from the decrease in the splicing efficiency. On the other hand, there was also a possibility that a putative transcriptional element is located in the 24-bp nucleotides from the 5′ splice junction (+154/+177). To examine the transcriptional activity of the region, Ad4CAT0.8K-EF and -ER were constructed by insertion of a 91-bp fragment (+146/+236) including the 24-bp nucleotides at the Eco81I site(−265) of Ad4CAT0.8K. The CAT activities in Y-1 cells increased by about 7-fold by the insertion of the fragment regardless of their orientations as shown in Fig. 3. The fragment also increased the CAT activities of the SV40 core promoter by about 5-fold (pCAT-EF and -ER) (Fig. 3).Figure 3:Transcriptional activity of the regulatory region in Y-1 cells. The genomic 91-bp fragment (+146/+236) was inserted into Ad4CAT0.8K or pCAT plasmid in forward (Ad4CAT0.8K-EF and pCAT-EF) and reverse (Ad4CAT0.8K-ER and pCAT-ER) directions as described under #x0201C;Experimental Procedures.” The relative CAT activities in comparison to the original plasmids (Ad4CAT0.8K and pCAT) were averaged for three experiments (±S.E.) and are shown on the right of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The binding factor(s) to the transcriptional element described above was investigated with the nuclear extract prepared from Y-1 cells. DNase I footprint analyses were performed using a DNA fragment from +57 to +316 containing the element. When the nuclear extract prepared from Y-1 cells was used, a single region was protected from DNase I digestion as shown in Fig. 4A. Interestingly, the protected region, 5′-TGAAGGCCGGGGCCCA-3′, contained a possible sequence (underlined) recognized by Ad4BP (Ad4 site)(1.Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Google Scholar). To determine whether Ad4BP or other proteins were responsible for the observed binding, gel mobility shift assays were performed with labeled dENC containing the protected sequence from the DNase I digestion. For characterization of the binding sequence, competition experiments were also performed with the oligonucleotides carrying nucleotide substitutions (dEM1 to dEM6) (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4C (left panel), a single complex formation with dENC was observed and was completely inhibited by an excess amount of nonradiolabeled dENC. The oligonucleotides, dEM2 and M3, carrying disrupted Ad4 sites did not function as competitors, whereas the other oligonucleotides, dENM1, M4, M5, and M6, carrying the intact Ad4 site were able to function as the competitors. As shown in Fig. 4C (right panel), the complexes with dENC showed the same mobility on a polyacrylamide gel as that with dAd4, an authentic Ad4 site in the bovine CYP11B(22.Honda S. Morohashi K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 1042-1049Google Scholar). The signals with the two distinct probes completely disappeared by the nonradiolabeled oligonucleotides each other. Finally, both complex formations were inhibited by the addition of an antiserum to Ad4BP. The same results were also obtained with a nuclear extract prepared from rat adrenal glands. To investigate the function of the Ad4 site directly, the GAAGGCCG sequence in Ad4ECAT0.8K was mutagenized to GAATATCG to generate Ad4ECAT0.8KA. The mutated sequence was confirmed to be incapable of binding to Ad4BP as described above. As shown in Fig. 5, the mutation within the Ad4 site caused more than a 80% decrease of the CAT activity. To examine the functional relationship between the Ad4 site and the E box in the transcriptional activity of the mftz-f1 gene, the CAT plasmid carrying the intact Ad4 but a mutated E box (Ad4ECAT0.8KM) was transfected. The mutation within the E box caused more than a 75% decrease of the CAT activity. A similar extent of decrease was observed when both the Ad4 site and the E box were mutated (Ad4ECAT0.8KMA). To obtain direct evidence that Ad4BP activates the transcription of the mftz-f1 gene, an expression vector for Ad4BP was cotransfected with Ad4ECAT2.0K or Ad4ECAT2.0KA into CV-1 cells which lacks endogenous Ad4BP. The Ad4BP expression vector activated the transcription of Ad4ECAT2.0K by about 3-fold as shown in Fig. 6. Because the disruption of the Ad4 site (Ad4ECAT2.0KA) completely abolished the activation, Ad4BP activated the gene as a consequence of the binding to the Ad4 site. A truncated form of Ad4BP (ΔAd4BP207) which lacks a putative activator domain at the carboxyl-terminal half but has the ability to bind to the Ad4 site (3.Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Google Scholar) failed to activate the transcription. An expression vector for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (5.Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar) was also cotransfected with that for Ad4BP. The protein kinase A expression vector had, however, no effect on the transactivation function of Ad4BP (data not shown). One of the questions to be addressed is whether the E box element and the Ad4 site of the mftz-f1 gene are active or not in the adrenal cortex. To answer this question, we compared the chromosomal structure of the region containing both the elements by detecting hypersensitive sites to DNase I. The nuclei prepared from rat adrenal glands, Y-1 cells, and a rat liver were subjected to DNase I digestion. As shown in Fig. 7, a 3.1-kb long HindIII-HindIII fragment containing both the E box and the Ad4 site was detected without DNase I digestion. If sensitive sites are present in this locus, DNA fragments of small sizes should appear depending on the concentration of DNase I. As expected, a signal with a length estimated to be from 1.1 to 1.3 kb was observed when the nuclear preparations from the adrenal glands and Y-1 cells were used, whereas no signal was detected with the liver nuclei. Judging from the length of the digested fragment, the region sensitive to DNase I seems to cover both the E box and the Ad4 site. In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the rat mftz-f1 gene and obtained strong evidence for the autoregulatory loop involved in the transcriptional regulation. The significant transcriptional enhancement by the first intron gave us a clue to find the autoregulatory loop. The regulatory region was located near the splice donor site in the first intron and the presence of an Ad4 site in the region was confirmed by using the specific antiserum to Ad4BP in the gel mobility shift analyses. In a previous paper(1.Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Google Scholar), we described the purified Ad4BP bound to PuPuAGGTCA as well as PyCAAGGPyPyPu. Although the Ad4 site (GAAGGCCG) identified in the present study satisfied neither of the two consensus sequences completely, it is likely to be an active derivative of the former sequence, where TCA at the 3′ side are changed to CCG. Based on our previous observation that the former consensus sequence showed a weaker binding affinity than the latter(1.Morohashi K. Honda S. Inomata Y. Handa H. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17913-17919Google Scholar), the Ad4 site identified in this study has relatively weak affinity in spite of its strong transcriptional activity. The inconsistency between the transcriptional activity and the binding affinity is probably explained by the following observation. In the mftz-f1 gene, the E box is the essential cis-element functioning cooperatively with the Ad4 site since the disruption of the E box caused a significant decrease of the transcriptional activity even in the presence of the intact Ad4 site. A similar decrease was also observed when only the Ad4 site was inactivated. These observations support the notion that the transcriptional activity of the Ad4 site is modulated by the function of the E box and thereby the Ad4 site shows the strong transcriptional activity in spite of the weak binding affinity. The regulatory region including the Ad4 site was shown to activate both the original mftz-f1 gene promoter carrying the E box and the heterologous SV40 basal promoter. In both cases, however, the transcriptional activations by the region were insufficient to explain the significant transcriptional enhancement by the first intron. A possible reason for the discrepancy is as follow. It was reported in several genes that the splicing reaction itself seems to be critical for efficient production of the mRNA species(27.Buchman A.R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4395-4405Google Scholar, 28.Korb M. Ke Y. Johnson L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5901-5908Google Scholar). It is possible that the pre-mRNA from Ad4ECAT0.8K was efficiently spliced to produce the mature mRNA, whereas those from Ad4CAT0.8K-ES/-ER and pCAT-ES/-ER were not. The function of the Ad4 site in the first intron of the mftz-f1 gene was further supported by the cotransfection assays with the expression vector for Ad4BP using CV-1 cells. The transcription was activated only when the CAT vector carrying the intact Ad4 site and the expression vector coding intact Ad4BP were used, although the activation by the coexpression of Ad4BP was smaller than expected. Since the transcription of the CYP11A and CYP11B genes was activated by Ad4BP only in the presence of an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A(5.Morohashi K. Zanger U.M. Honda S. Hara M. Waterman M.R. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1196-1204Google Scholar), the effect of the protein kinase A was also examined. However, a further activation was not achieved with the mftz-f1 gene. Considering the cooperative function of the E box and the Ad4 site, the low activation might be due to the absence of the E box binding factor in CV-1 cells. In fact, when the nuclear extracts prepared from Y-1 cells and CV-1 cells were examined by the gel mobility shift analyses, the E box binding factor was detectable with the Y-1 but not with the CV-1 nuclear extract (data not shown). Differentiated tissues originate from the primordial cells through successive events. Various sets of genes express their functions at the destined time points along the differentiation steps, and finally the tissues acquire their specific functions by expressing the final set of the tissue-specific genes. In the case of the adernal cortex, the differentiated tissue is able to synthesize steroid hormones owing to the functions of the steroidogenic tissue-specific P-450s. When the differentiation process is considered, it seems reasonable to suppose that a gene regulatory cascade functions along the process, in which the genes encoding specific transcription factors are involved as the components. In the cascade required for adrenocortical differentiation, Ad4BP should be located upstream of the adrenocortical specific genes including the steroidogenic P-450 genes, while it is located downstream of other genes regulating the mftz-f1 gene transcription. It was clarified in the present study that the mftz-f1 gene is activated by the autoregulatory loop. Therefore, it is quite interesting to suppose that once the autoregulatory loop starts to function in the particular cell types, the upstream genes essential for the initial activation of the mftz-f1 gene transcription are no longer necessary thereafter to maintain the Ad4BP expression. Such the autoregulation was reported to function in the HOX4C(29.Zappavigna V. Renucci A. Izpisua-Belmonte J.-C. Urier G. Peschle C. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4177-4187Google Scholar), Hox 4.2(30.Pöpperl H. Featherstone M.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3673-3680Google Scholar), MyoD1(31.Thayer M.J. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Lassar A.B.

Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Google Scholar), and sex-lethal(39.Keyes L.N. Cline T.W. Schedl P. Cell. 1992; 68: 933-943Google Scholar) genes in Drosophila. Interestingly, all the genes listed above have been reported to play significant roles in the differentiation of particular tissues or cell types. These observations, including the present one, seem to indicate that the autoregulatory mechanism is widely adopted as the transcriptional regulation of the key transcription factors during differentiation. The chromatin structure of the mftz-f1 gene was also investigated by detecting the hypersensitive site to DNase I. The region containing the Ad4 site and the E box was observed to be open in the steroidogenic tissue but not in the non-steroidogenic tissue. The steroidogenic tissue-specific chromatin structure is probably essential to the mftz-f1 gene transcription by making the transcription factors such as Ad4BP and E box binding factor accessible to their binding sites. Accordingly, it is supposed that the tissue-specific transcription of the gene is also guaranteed by the tissue-specific chromatin structure in addition to the tissue-specific transcription factor. The present study demonstrated that the rat mftz-f1 gene is autoregulated through the Ad4 site in the first intron and that the E box is essential for the function of the Ad4 site. These observations, however, were made with Y-1 cells which have differentiated features as the adrenocortical cells. Because of the crucial role of Ad4BP in adrenal and gonadal differentiation, it is of importance to study the transcriptional regulation of the gene during the differentiation processes of the animal tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2043958838,"Activation of T lymphocytes requires the combined signaling of the T cell receptor and costimulatory molecules such as CD28. The ability of T cells to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a critical control point in T lymphocyte activation. The IL-2 enhancer contains a functional motif named CD28 response element (CD28RE) that serves a role as a target for mitogenic T cell activation signals. The CD28RE sequence reveals similarity to the consensus κB binding motif. Here we demonstrate that CD28RE binds an inducible protein with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa called nuclear factor of mitogenic-activated T cells (NF-MATp35) that is clearly different from the known NF-κB/Rel family members. Induction of NF-MATp35 was shown to depend on de novo protein synthesis and was restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell stimuli, not necessarily including CD28 signaling. Nonmitogenic T cell stimulation did not result in appearance of NF-MATp35. These results indicate that mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals are integrated at the level of NF-MATp35 induction. Similar to its effect on IL-2 production, cyclosporin A inhibited the induction of NF-MATp35.

Proliferation and maturation of resting T lymphocytes is an essential process in the T cell-mediated immune response. Resting T lymphocytes can be activated via noncovalent interactions of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell antigen receptorIL-2interleukin-2CsAcyclosporin ACD28RECD28 response elementNF-MATnuclear factor of mitogenic activated T cellsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetateBrdUrdBromodeoxyuridine.) complex with a peptide in association with major histocompatibility complex molecules. Besides TCR signaling, a second antigen-nonspecific costimulatory is required for optimal T cell activation, which is accompanied by the production of high levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2)(1.Schwartz R.H.

Occupancy of the TCR without a costimulatory signal leads to aborted T cell activation and the development of functional unresponsiveness or clonal anergy of T cells in which the T cells are incapable of producing IL-2(1.Schwartz R.H.

Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This costimulatory signal is induced upon interaction of CD28 with its counterreceptors CD80 and CD86 that are expressed on the APC(9.Linsley P.S. Clark E.A. Ledbetter J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Monoclonal anti-CD28 antibodies either cooperate with soluble anti-CD3, which simulates antigen-specific TCR triggering, or synergize with protein kinase C for the induction of IL-2 production and T cell proliferation. Unlike the TCR-induced signaling pathway, the CD28 signal transduction route does not involve the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or translocation of protein kinase C and is resistant to the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporin A (CsA) (8.June C.H.

The latter observation implies that TCR and costimulatory signals become integrated at the level of c-jun kinase activation. Human T cells respond to CD28 costimulation by a dramatic enhancement in the induction of IL-2 mRNA. Two mechanisms account for the CD28 co-induced expression of the IL-2 gene.

Regulation of IL-2 gene transcription is controlled by an enhancer extending from −52 to −319 relative to the transcription initiation site(22.Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J.G. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R.

Specific regulatory sequences that bind the nuclear factors AP-1, NF-κB, Oct-1, and NF-AT1 have been implicated in regulation of IL-2 gene transcription (reviewed in (24.Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar)). We and others have identified a sequence from −162 to −153 (5′-AGAAATTCCA-3′) within the IL-2 enhancer that serves a crucial role as a response element for mitogenic combinations T cell activation signals (18.Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 19.Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 3041-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The sequence of the CD28RE motif is strongly conserved between the human and murine IL-2 gene. Comparison of the sequence with that of binding motifs of known transcription factors reveals similarity to the consensus NF-κB binding motif(26.Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar, 27.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Only the first and the last (tenth) position differ from the consensus NF-κB binding motif(19.Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The significance of the sequence similarity has been shown by cross competition studies using CD28RE and the HIV-1 κB motif in combination with nuclear extracts of mitogenic-activated cells. The HIV-1 κB motif efficiently competed for CD28RE binding activity, whereas CD28RE proved about 25-fold less effective in competition for HIV-1 κB binding activity than the HIV-1 κB motif itself. These data suggest that proteins involved in interacting with CD28RE are also involved in binding the HIV-1 κB motif. In vitro binding studies have demonstrated that induction of CD28RE binding activity is restricted to T cells that received a mitogenic combination of T cell activation signals, not necessarily including CD28(25.Civil A. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. Verweij C.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3041-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Ghosh P. Tan T.-H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this manuscript we describe the characterization of a protein called NF-MATp35 (nuclear factor of mitogenic activated T cells) that binds CD28RE. Although evidence is presented that NF-MATp35 also binds to the κB motif, NF-MATp35 is clearly distinct from the known NF-κB/Rel family members. It is demonstrated that the induction of NF-MATp35 shows excellent correlation with IL-2 production.

After 48 h, cytosolic extracts were prepared by lysis of the cells in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride(42.Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (9105) Google Scholar). Proteins precipitated from these extracts with 25% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate were resuspended in modified buffer D(42.Dignam D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (9105) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were stimulated as indicated and nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described by Ohlsson and Edlund(43.Ohlsson H. Edlund T. Cell. 1986; 45: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were finally precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 (0.3 g/ml) and dissolved in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Binding reactions contained 6 μg of nuclear extract, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 5 μg of poly(dI-dC) and were incubated for 10 min at room temperature prior to incubation with about 10,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled double-stranded probe for 30 min at room temperature in a total volume of 15 μl. Antibodies were added 5′ prior to the addition of the probe. As probes we used CD28RE (5′-gatcTTTGGAATTTCTT-3′) and HIV-1 κB (5′-GAGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) oligonucleotides. Complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels with 45 mM Tris borate, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0 buffer. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-substituted oligonucleotides were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer (Millipore Expedite Nucleic Acid Synthesis System). The following probes were used (thymidines tagged with an asterisk are substituted by bromodeoxyuridine): CD28RE-1, 5′-gatcAAGAAATT*CCAAAgatc-3′ and 3′-ctagTTCTTT*AAGGTTTctag-5′; CD28RE-2, 5′-gatcAAGAAATT*CCAAAgatc-3′ and 3′-ctagTTCTT*TAAGGTTTctag 5′; CD28RE-3, 5′-gatcAAGAAATT*CCAAAgatc-3′ and 3′-ctagTTCT*TTAAGGTTTctag 5′; HIV-1 κB, 5′-gatcGAGGGGACT*TTCCgatc-3′ and 3′-ctagCTCCCCT*GAAAGGctag 5′. DNA binding reactions were performed by incubation of 12 μg of nuclear extract with the BrdUrd-substituted probe (1-5 × 107 cpm) in the presence of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. Nucleoproteins were first resolved by gel retardation prior to UV irradiation in situ (UV Stratalinker, Stratagene). Covalently linked nucleoprotein complexes were eluted from the gel and further analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after precipitation with acetone. For immunoprecipitation the eluted proteins were mixed with 1 μl of undiluted antiserum and protein A-Sepharose beads. The bound proteins were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(44.Ballard D.W. Walker W.H. Doerre S. Sista P. Molitor J.A. Dixon E.P.

A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) have demonstrated specific binding of an inducible nuclear factor with the CD28RE motif. The CD28RE binding factor was found to be selectively induced by distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell stimuli, not necessarily including CD28 signaling (25.Civil A. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. Verweij C.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3041-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Ghosh P. Tan T.-H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). We named this factor NF-MAT, which stands for nuclear factor of mitogenic activated T cells. To characterize the inducible nucleoprotein(s) that constitutes NF-MAT, we performed UV cross-linking experiments with a 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-substituted CD28RE probe. Nuclear extract of Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was incubated with this probe, and the protein-bound DNA fraction was separated by gel retardation and subjected to in situ UV irradiation. Analysis of the cross-linked protein-DNA complexes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of two protein-DNA bands that migrated with molecular masses of 35 and 70 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2B). Next we applied UV cross-linking analysis to confirm that the CD28RE-protein complex that appeared upon stimulation of Jurkat cells via different modes of mitogenic T cell activation revealed the same pattern of protein-DNA bands as we observed for the complex induced by the combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 2B). Because the CD28RE-binding proteins selectively showed up in nuclei of mitogenic activated T cells, we refer to the proteins that correspond to the 35- and 70-kDa cross-linked adducts as NF-MATp35 and NF-MATp70, respectively. The actual molecular mass of these proteins could be slightly lower than that of the respective protein-DNA complexes due to the absence of covalently bound oligonucleotide. Many nuclear proteins have been shown to bind their cognate binding motif as a dimer(26.Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar, 27.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar, 29.Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 71-79Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both homo- and heterodimers have been shown to be involved in DNA binding. To explore the possibility that NF-MATp70 represents the dimeric form of NF-MATp35, we performed UV dose titration experiments (Fig. 3). These experiments revealed that upon short exposure (i.e. 1 min) the 35-kDa band predominated, whereas the balance shifted toward the 70-kDa band during long exposure (15 min). This result suggests that the protein present in the 70-kDa complex represents the homodimer of the 35-kDa protein moiety. The CD28RE sequence revealed similarity to the NF-κB consensus sequence(18.Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 26.Baeuerle P. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar, 27.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Based on the ability of κB motifs to compete for NF-MAT binding, we determined whether NF-κB immunoreactivity could be detected in the UV cross-linked CD28RE-protein complex. In Fig. 4A it is demonstrated that none of the antibodies directed against the individual NF-κB/Rel proteins NFκB1, Rel-A, and c-Rel were able to immunoprecipitate CD28RE cross-linked protein. The capacity of these antibodies to immunoprecipitate NF-κB/Rel-DNA complexes was demonstrated using recombinant NF-κB/Rel proteins in combination with a BrdUrd-incorporated HIV-1 κB probe (Fig. 4B). NF-κB/Rel proteins are known to be efficiently expressed in T cells receiving a single stimulus. In analogy with these observations, anti-CD3 or PMA alone proved to be effective in the induction of HIV-1 κB motif binding activity (Fig. 5A). When HIV-1 κB protein complexes formed in nuclear extracts of cells that received a single stimulus were compared with those from cells that were treated with a mitogenic combination of stimuli, we observed both quantitative and qualitative differences. Complexes that appeared in nuclear extracts of cells that were treated with a mitogenic combination of stimuli revealed increased intensity and were extended with a form exhibiting enhanced mobility (C2). In order to determine whether NF-MATp35 contributes to the HIV-1 NF-κB-protein complex, we performed UV cross-linking experiments with a BrdUrd-incorporated HIV-1 κB motif. With nuclear extracts of nonmitogenic activated T cells, two major protein-DNA bands with molecular masses of approximately 70-85 kDa and 50 kDa, respectively, were observed (Fig. 5B). HIV-1 κB-protein complexes that were formed in nuclear extracts of cells that have received a mitogenic combination of activation signals contained an additional protein-DNA product with a molecular mass identical to that of the NF-MATp35-CD28RE complex. Distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation conditions led to the inclusion of this protein in the HIV-1 κB-protein complex. Similar to the NF-MATp35-CD28RE complex, the 35-kDa protein-HIV-1 κB complex could not be immunoprecipitated with anti-NFκB1, anti-RelA, and anti-c-Rel antibodies (data not shown). To determine whether nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, we investigated the effects of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on the mitogen-inducible nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35. The addition of cycloheximide 30 min prior to stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 led to a dramatic reduction in the appearance of NF-MAT binding to CD28RE (Fig. 6). This result indicates that either NF-MATp35 itself must be synthesized or that another protein needs to be synthesized that activates a pre-existing but inactive form of NF-MATp35. When the HIV-1 κB motif was used as a probe, cycloheximide selectively inhibited the appearance of the fast migrating moiety (C2) of the mitogenic induced complex (Fig. 7A). The addition of anti-serum directed against NFκB1 reveals that the complex that appears with extracts of nuclei from mitogenic stimulated (anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28) cells in the presence of cycloheximide resembles the complex induced upon nonmitogenic stimulation with anti-CD3 alone (Fig. 7B). UV cross-linking analysis with a BrdUrd-substituted HIV-1 κB motif shows that the complex that appears in the presence of cycloheximide is devoid of the p35 protein (Fig. 6B). This result is in accordance with the NF-MAT data and substantiates the conclusion that the protein that constitutes the 35-kDa protein-HIV-1 κB complex is identical to NF-MATp35. Next we studied the effect of CsA on the induction of NF-MATp35. For this purpose, we monitored the effect of CsA on the appearance of NF-MAT/CD28RE complex formation. CsA prevented NF-MAT induction after treatment with anti-CD3 in combination of either anti-CD28 or PMA (Fig. 6). Although the response of NF-MAT to the stimuli that included Ca2+ signaling was inhibited by CsA, the response to the combination of PMA and CD28, a Ca2+-independent mode of T cell activation, was not affected by CsA. This result is in favor of the conclusion that distinct combinations of signaling pathways converge on the activation of NF-MAT. The effects of CsA on the induction of NF-MAT are in perfect correlation with the effects of CsA on IL-2 production. As anticipated we found a similar effect with CsA on the appearance of the fast migrating moiety (C2) of the HIV-1 κB-protein complex (Fig. 7B). This result further substantiates the conclusion that this moiety represents the NF-MATp35 containing part of the complex. In this study we describe an approximately 35-kDa inducible protein, named NF-MATp35, which interacts with the CD28RE within the IL-2 enhancer. Distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals contribute to the nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35, indicating that there is a redundancy in the activation requirements of NF-MATp35. We previously reported that the CD28RE sequence displays similarity with the κB enhancer consensus motif. The Rel-related proteins c-Rel, NFκB1, and RelA constitute a major class of κB enhancer-binding proteins. In line with this Ghosh et al.(28.Ghosh P. Tan T.-H. Rice N.R. Sica A. Young H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) were able to detect the presence of NFκB1, RelA, and c-Rel among the proteins that bind CD28RE. However, the affinity for NF-κB/Rel proteins is low as judged from competition experiments and UV cross-linking studies performed by us and others(19.Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4357-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31.Li M. Siekevitz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our data clearly demonstrate that NF-MATp35 is distinct from NFκB1, RelA, and c-Rel. First, the activation requirements of NF-MATp35 are more stringent than those for the induction of the NF-κB/Rel family members. Second, the molecular mass of NF-MATp35 does not match those of the individual NF-κB/Rel proteins. Third, antibodies directed against NFκB1, RelA, or c-Rel have not been successful in immunoprecipitating NF-MATp35 covalently linked to CD28RE. Finally, the appearance of NF-MATp35 is dependent on protein synthesis. It is interesting that Fraser and Weiss (30.Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4357-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) reported that the predominant protein species present in the CD28RC constitute three proteins of 35, 36, and 44 kDa. The most abundant were the 35/36-kDa proteins. It could be that NF-MATp35 is related to one of these proteins; however, in contrast to NF-MATp35, the CD28RC proteins require the contribution of the CD28 signaling for their nuclear appearance. In addition, none of these proteins appears upon stimulation with anti-CD28 plus PMA but requires the addition of a third stimulus, i.e. ionomycin. Furthermore, Li and Siekevitz (31.Li M. Siekevitz M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6490-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) described a 45-kDa Tax inducible protein (TxREF) distinct from NF-κB/Rel that specifically interacts with CD28RE. This protein could be related to the 44-kDa protein described by Fraser and Weiss(30.Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4357-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The low affinity of CD28RE for binding NF-κB/Rel proteins could be explained by differences in the 5′ and 3′ extremities between CD28RE and NF-κB/Rel binding motifs. Analysis of the various NF-κB/Rel binding motifs has showed that the 5′ and 3′ ends of the recognition motif are the best conserved parts(32.Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on crystallographic analysis of NF-κB-DNA complexes, it is believed that these parts of the κB binding motif in particular are involved in NF-κB/Rel binding(33.Ghosh G. Van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 34.Muller C.W. Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The fact that NF-MATp35 binds to the κB elements as well as to CD28RE, whereas NF-κB/Rel proteins have a preference for the consensus-matching sequences, indicates that less variation is tolerated for binding of NF-κB/Rel proteins than for NF-MATp35. This might implicate that every κB element is in potency able to bind NF-MATp35. A functional role of CD28RE as a mitogen response element in the activation of the IL-2 enhancer stems from studies wherein a mutant enhancer with a nonfunctional CD28RE site was used in transient expression studies(18.Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 19.Verweij C.L. Geerts M. Aarden L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14179-14182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In accordance with the requirements for NF-MATp35 induction, mutations within the CD28RE motif affected the IL-2 enhancer in its capacity to respond to mitogenic T cell activation signals. Because CD28RE serves a role as a response element for distinct mitogenic combinations of T cell activation signals not necessarily including CD28 signaling, we propose to name the element MARS, which stands for mitogenic activation responsive sequence (35.Civil A. Verweij C.L. Res. Immunol. 1995; 146: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). IL-2 production is either completely resistant (anti-CD28 plus PMA) or sensitive (anti-CD3 plus either anti-CD28 or PMA) to the immunosuppressive action of CsA(13.June C.H. Ledbetter J.A. Gillespie Lindsten T. Thompson C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4472-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 36.Bloemena E. Van Oers R.H.J. Weinreich Eur. J.

Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Inhibition of IL-2 gene expression by CsA is explained by the negative effects of CsA on the nuclear expression of the cytoplasmic component of NF-AT and the activation of Oct-1/AP1, both known to be TCR-responsive nuclear proteins(37.Emmel E.A. Verweij C.L. Durand D.B. Higgins K.M. Lacy E. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1989; 246: 1617-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 38.Flanagan W.M. Corthesy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R.

Here we demonstrated that nuclear appearance of NF-MATp35 is also sensitive to CsA. The sensitivity of NF-MATp35 for CsA is, similar to IL-2 gene expression, dependent on the mode of mitogenic stimulation. When Ca2+ influx is not involved in the signaling regime, NF-MAT still appears. Taken together the above mentioned results show that the induction of NF-MATp35 reveals excellent correlation with activation of IL-2 gene expression (Table 1). This is a unique characteristic among nuclear proteins implicated in IL-2 gene regulation and suggests a crucial role for NF-MATp35 in IL-2 gene regulation.Tabled 1 Similar to the induction of NF-MATp35, the activation of c-jun kinase revealed excellent correlation with IL-2 production(17.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). However, based on supershift analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-c-jun antibodies, we could exclude the possibility that NF-MATp35 is identical to c-jun.( 2A. Civil, A. Bakker, and C. L. Verweij, unpublished observations.) c-jun kinase is the only protein kinase among the kinases involved in mitogenic signaling described so far that requires mitogenic combinations of T cell stimuli for its activation. This indicates that signal integration occurs at an even more proximal step in the events that lead to IL-2 gene transcription than NF-MATp35 induction. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate whether NF-MATp35 is somehow involved in c-jun kinase signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2152773381,"To investigate the mechanisms underlying the enhanced mitogenic activity of the truncated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) lacking the C-terminal autophosphorylation sites (Δ973-EGFR), we studied the intracellular signaling pathways in NR6 cells expressing human wild type EGFR and Δ973-EGFR. Microinjection of dominant/negative p21ras(N17) completely inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis in both cell types. EGF stimulated Shc phosphorylation as well as the formation of wild type EGFR•Shc complexes. In contrast, EGF stimulated Shc phosphorylation without formation of Δ973-EGFR•Shc complexes. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc formed complexes with Grb2•Sos, and microinjection of anti-Shc antibody and Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein inhibited EGF stimulation of DNA synthesis in both cell lines. EGF markedly increased ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation in wild type EGFR cells. In Δ973-EGFR cells, ErbB2 was tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal state and EGFR stimulated further phosphorylation of ErbB2. In addition to ErbB2, additional proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated in Δ973-EGFR cells, mostly in the molecular mass range of 120-170 kDa. Taken together with our findings indicating coupling of ErbB2 to Shc, these data suggest the importance of an alternative signaling pathway in Δ973-EGFR cells mediated by the formation of heterodimeric structures between the truncated EGFR and ErbB2, followed by coupling through Shc to Grb2•Sos and the p21ras pathway, ultimately leading to mitogenesis.

Alternatively, the SH2 domain of Grb2 can also bind to phosphorylated Shc, which itself can recognize EGFR autophosphorylation motifs via its SH2 and N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain(18.Buday L.

Thus, EGFR•Grb2•Sos and/or EGFR•Shc•Grb2•Sos provide a mechanism whereby EGF can stimulate p21ras GTP formation. Recently, we reported the importance of Shc as an adaptor protein transducing mitogenic signaling from activated EGFR to p21ras activation (26.Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar, 27.Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Google Scholar). Although the association of phosphorylated EGFRs with these adaptor proteins provides the mechanism to trigger downstream signals, mutant EGFRs in which the tyrosine phosphorylation sites were replaced with phenylalanine signal to the same extent as wild type EGFRs do (28.Decker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9176-9179Google Scholar). In addition, mutant EGFRs truncated at amino acid residue 973 (Δ973-EGFR) which lack the C-terminal five autophosphorylation sites mediate enhanced cell cycle progression(2.Decker S.J. Alexander C. Habib T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1104-1108Google Scholar, 29.Masui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6170-6175Google Scholar, 30.Wells A. Welsh J.B. Lazar C.S. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1990; 247: 962-964Google Scholar). Since neither Shc nor Grb2, which are important for p21ras activation, directly binds to Δ973-EGFR following EGF stimulation, an alternative pathway leading to cell cycle progression bypassing p21ras may reside in cells expressing Δ973-EGFRs. Alternatively, since Shc was still tyrosine phosphorylated without association with the EGFR mutant lacking the autophosphorylation sites(3.Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report, we directly evaluated the importance of p21rasin Δ973-EGFR mediated mitogenic signaling using a single cell microinjection assay, and identified an alternative mechanism leading to the p21ras activation. Here, we show that ErbB2 plays an important role in NR6 cells expressing Δ973-EGFRs. NR6 cells expressing 1×105 wild type human EGFRs or a similar number of EGFRs truncated at amino acid residue 973 (Δ973) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously(29.Masui H.

Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Characteristics of polyclonal (4-17) and monoclonal (528) anti-EGFR antibodies, and a polyclonal anti-ErbB2 antibody were as described previously(29.Masui H. Wells A. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G.

Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar). Briefly, a cDNA for the human Shc-SH2 domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using oligonucleotides with BamHI(5′)-3′EcoRI linkers. The purified BamHI-EcoRI DNA fragments from polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into a BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-KT expression vector. A plasmid was generated that encoded the peptide fused to the C terminus of GST. The fusion protein contained residues 378-471 of the human Shc protein(7.Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli by isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside induction and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads(26.Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and rendered quiescent by starvation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Antibodies or glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, which were solubilized in microinjection buffer consisting of 5 mM NaPO4 and 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4, were then microinjected using glass capillary needles. Approximately 1 × 10-14 l of the buffer was introduced into each cell. The injection included about 1 × 106 molecules of IgG to permit identification of injected cells. Two hours after microinjection, cells were incubated with BrdU plus either vehicle, 160 nM EGF or 10% fetal calf serum, for 16 h at 37°C. The cells were fixed with acid alcohol (90% ethanol, 5% acetic acid) for 20 min at 22°C and then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h at 22°C. The cells were then stained by incubation with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at 22°C. After the coverslips were mounted, the cells were analyzed with an Axiphot fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Microinjected cell numbers were 250-300 per coverslip. Immunofluorescent staining of the injected cells indicated that about 75% of the cells were successfully microinjected(26.Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Cell monolayers were starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. The cells were then treated with various concentrations of EGF for the indicated times at 37°C. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 30 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mM Na3VO4, pH 7.4. The cell lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials. The supernatants (100 μg of protein) were used for immunoprecipitation with the indicated antibodies for 5 h at 4°C, or for 90 min with Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein, which was then precipitated with glutathione-agarose. The precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus. The membranes were blocked in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5, for 2 h at 20°C. The membranes were then probed with specified antibodies for 2 h at 20°C. After washing the membranes in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked second antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using the ECL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.)(21.Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 26.Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

Cells were starved for 16 h in serum-free DMEM. The cells were then treated with 160 nM EGF at 37°C for 2 min. The cells were collected in a buffer containing 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The cells were disrupted by 20 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5402 centrifuge at 4°C for 3 min to remove the nuclear fraction. The supernatants were recentrifuged at 220,000 × g at 4°C for 60 min. The particulate fraction was suspended in a buffer containing 0.05% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM GTP, 100 μM GDP, pH 7.5, and sonicated at 4°C for 30 s. The GEF activity in the membranes was determined by measuring the dissociation of protein-bound [3H]GDP radioactivity using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. Purified c-Ha-Ras was incubated with [3H]GDP in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 400 μg/ml chain A insulin, pH 7.5, for 15 min at 30°C. The Ras•GDP complex was added to the membrane preparations and incubated at 23°C. After 15 min, aliquots were removed and filtered through 0.45-μm Millipore nitrocellulose filters. The amount of [3H]GDP radioactivity bound to p21ras was quantitated by scintillation counting. [3H]GDP binding to p21ras was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Ras antibody. Background counts/min were less than 1% of total bound [3H]GDP(27.Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Google Scholar, 34.Sasaoka T. Draznin B. Leitner J.W. Langlois W.J. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10734-10738Google Scholar). We and others have shown that p21ras is involved in EGF stimulation of cell cycle progression(9.Mulcahy L.S. Smith M.R. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1985; 313: 241-243Google Scholar, 10.Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Akiyama T. Yamamoto T. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7926-7929Google Scholar, 26.Sasaoka T. Rose D.W. Jhun B.H. Saltiel A.R. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13689-13694Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of p21ras in the signaling pathway engaged by the truncated Δ973-EGFR, we performed single cell microinjection studies. Dominant negative p21ras(N17) was injected into NR6 cells expressing wild type EGFRs or Δ973-EGFRs. Following microinjection, the cells were stimulated with EGF, and cell cycle progression was monitored by measuring BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. In the basal state, 3.5 ± 0.3% and 12.1 ± 1.1% of cells incorporated BrdU in wild type and Δ973-EGFR cells, respectively. EGF stimulated BrdU incorporation into 34.2 ± 0.8% and 50.9 ± 5.6% of the cells, respectively (Fig. 1). Microinjection of preimmune control IgG did not alter this stimulatory effect (data not shown). In contrast, microinjection of N17-Ras markedly inhibited EGF stimulation of DNA synthesis by 91% and 100%, respectively, indicating that p21ras plays a central role in Δ973-EGFR as well as wild type EGFR signaling (Fig. 1). Previous studies suggest that the predominant mechanism whereby EGF activates p21ras is by inducing the formation of Shc•Grb2•Sos complexes(27.Sasaoka T. Langlois W.J. Leitner J.W. Draznin B. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32621-32625Google Scholar, 35.Pronk G.J. Vries-Smits A.M.M. Buday L. Downward J. Maassen J.A. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Google Scholar). To assess Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were stimulated with EGF for the indicated times. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. EGF stimulated Shc phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in wild type EGFR cells (Fig. 2). Shc was tyrosine phosphorylated in a similar fashion in Δ973-EGFR cells, even though the C-terminal EGFR autophosphorylation sites which bind to Shc are absent in the truncated receptor. As evidenced in Fig. 2, EGF treatment of wild type EGFR cells stimulated the association of Shc with two phosphoproteins, pp170 and pp145. pp170 is the EGFR which was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-EGFR antibody (data not shown). In the case of Δ973-EGFR cells, pp145 was also found to associate with Shc in an EGF dependent manner. Furthermore, there was much more tyrosine phosphorylated pp145 associated with Shc in the Δ973-EGFR cells than in the wild type EGFR cells. pp145 is not the truncated EGFR, since it was seen in the wild type EGFR cells also, was not detected by reprobing the membrane for EGFR (data not shown), and because the Δ973 EGFR has previously been shown not to become tyrosine-phosphorylated(36.Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Google Scholar). In addition, a tyrosine phosphoprotein of pp185 was seen after EGF stimulation in the Shc precipitates (data not shown). To evaluate the functional role of Shc in EGF induced mitogenic signaling in Δ973-EGFR cells, anti-Shc antibody was microinjected into quiescent cells. Microinjection of anti-Shc antibody did not have any effect on ligand independent DNA synthesis, since basal BrdU incorporation in both uninjected and antibody-injected cells was comparable (Fig. 3). Stimulation of quiescent cells with EGF induced a marked increase in DNA synthesis. Microinjection of anti-Shc antibody reduced the ability of EGF to stimulate DNA synthesis by 80% in wild type EGFR cells. Microinjection of anti-Shc antibody also inhibited DNA synthesis in Δ973-EGFR cells, although the inhibition was less (48%) than that seen in wild type EGFR cells. Interestingly, microinjection of anti-Shc antibody did not block serum-induced DNA synthesis in cells expressing either wild type or Δ973 EGFR. Shc binds to the phosphorylated EGFR at least partially through its SH2 domain(18.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Google Scholar, 19.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L.

Microinjection of Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein inhibited EGF-induced DNA synthesis by 80% in wild type EGFR cells, indicating the importance of Shc-SH2•EGFR interaction in these cells (Fig. 4). Interestingly, microinjection of the Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein significantly blocked EGF stimulation of cell cycle progression in Δ973-EGFR cells (Fig. 4), despite the lack of any demonstrable co-precipitation of Δ973-EGFR and Shc (Fig. 2). As seen with microinjection of anti-Shc antibody, the Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein did not block serum-induced DNA synthesis in either cell type. These results contrast with N17 dominant negative ras, where microinjection inhibited both EGF- and serum-induced DNA synthesis. It has been shown that the EGFR, Grb2, and Shc form complexes after EGF stimulation(18.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Google Scholar, 19.Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L.

To assess their association more quantitatively, EGF-treated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Shc, anti-EGFR, or anti-Grb2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Shc, or anti-Grb2 antibody as shown in Fig. 5, panels A, B, and C. Panel A illustrates that the EGFR underwent tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF. Further, the presence of the EGFR in anti-Shc and anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates demonstrates that Shc and Grb2 associate with the phosphorylated EGFR. Panels B and C indicate the EGF stimulation caused association of Shc with Grb2, confirming that an EGFR•Shc•Grb2•Sos signaling complex was formed. Precipitation of cell lysates with a Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein revealed that a small amount of pp145 was precipitated after EGF stimulation (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2).Figure 6:EGF-stimulated complex formation with Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein. Serum-starved wild type EGFR cells (lanes 1 and 2) and Δ973-EGFR cells (lanes 3 and 4) were stimulated without (lanes 1 and 3) or with (lanes 2 and 4) 160 nM EGF for 2 min at 37°C. After treatment, cell lysates were affinity-precipitated with Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein. The precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P, and immunoblots were performed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Molecular masses of EGFR (170 kDa), and ErbB2 (185 kDa), and Shc-associated protein pp145 (145 kDa) are shown by arrows. Results are representative of two separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Co-immunoprecipitation studies also showed complex formation in Δ973-EGFR cells, as seen in Fig. 5, panels D, E, and F. Phosphotyrosine immunoblotting in panel D revealed that EGF stimulated the association of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp145 with both Shc and Grb2, while phosphorylated pp185 was precipitated by the EGFR antibody. Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4, indicate that much more pp145 is precipitated by the Shc-SH2 GST fusion protein after EGF stimulation of the Δ973-EGFR cells than by the wild type EGFR cells. Thus, phosphorylation of pp145 seems to be up-regulated in the Δ973-EGFR cells. Panels E and F illustrate that EGF induced the association of Shc with Grb2. The absence of Shc and Grb2 in the anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates in panels E and F indicates that neither Shc nor Grb2 associates with the Δ973-EGFR, and this was expected due to its lack of autophosphorylation sites for SH2 domain recognition. Thus, EGF induced the formation of Shc•Grb2 complexes, and at least some of these complexes were associated with phosphorylated pp145. Sos is a GEF for p21ras which is translocated from the cytosol to membrane fractions following EGF stimulation(18.Buday L. Downward J. Cell. 1993; 73: 611-620Google Scholar, 27.Sasaoka T.

Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2412-2417Google Scholar). GEF activity was measured in the membrane fractions from wild type and Δ973-EGFR cells. Membrane associated GEF activity in the basal state was 16.5 ± 0.4% and 28.6 ± 3.0% in wild type EGFR and Δ973-EGFR cells, respectively. EGF increased membrane GEF activity to 46.8 ± 1.0% and 51.5 ± 4.0%, respectively (Fig. 7). Thus, both basal and EGF-stimulated GEF activity were higher in Δ973-EGFR cells than in wild type EGFR cells, but EGF caused translocation to the membrane in both cell types. Ligand mediated interactions between EGFR and ErbB2 have been previously reported (38.Kraus M.H. Issing W. Miki T. Popescu N.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1567758144,"When a recombinant variant of prothrombin with the cleavage site mutations R155A, R271A, and R284A (rMZ) is exposed to either prothrombinase or ecarin, a form of meizothrombin (rMZa) is generated that is stable for weeks in the presence of Ca<sub>2</sub> (Côté, H. C. F., Stevens, W. K., Bajzar, L., Banfield, D. K., Nesheim, M. E., and MacGillivray, R. T. A.(1994) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 269, 11374-11380). In the absence of Ca<sub>2</sub> however, rMZa is rapidly cleaved within a disulfide bonded loop in the F1 domain at Arg<sup>55</sup> in the sequence RTPR↓DKL, yielding a molecule with 3 chains joined by two disulfide bonds (rMZa*). Cleavage kinetics are first order regardless of the rMZa concentration, indicating an intramolecular cleavage. This cleavage does not occur at Ca<sub>2</sub> concentrations in excess of 1.0 mM. To assess the role of the F1 domain in rMZa activity, another variant lacking the R155A mutation (rMZdesF1) was expressed, which when activated yields meizothrombin lacking the F1 domain (rMZdesF1a). Rates of hydrolysis of the tripeptide substrate S2238 by rMZa or rMZa* increase from 60% to 90% that of recombinant thrombin as Ca<sub>2</sub>, Mg<sub>2</sub>, or Mn<sub>2</sub> concentrations are varied from 0 to 10 mM. <i>K</i><sub>m</sub> and <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub> values for rMZa in the absence and presence of 5 mM Ca<sub>2</sub> are 1.9 and 2.2 μM and 65 and 105 s<sup>-1</sup>. TAME esterase activity of rMZa also increases with 5 mM Ca<sub>2</sub>. No such metal ion-dependent effects are obtained with either thrombin or rMZdesF1a. Fibrinogen clotting activities, relative to that of thrombin, increase in a manner analogous to those obtained with small substrates, for rMZa and rMZa* but not rMZdesF1a. Complexes of the active site probe dansylarginine <i>N</i>-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide with rMZa and rMZa*, but not thrombin or rMZdesF1a exhibit large cation-dependent decreases in fluorescence intensity, suggesting that metal ion binding in the F1 domain alters the environment of the probe at the active site. These results indicate that in the absence of divalent cations, the activity of rMZa is inhibited, perhaps by obstruction of the active site by the F1 domain, and that Ca<sub>2</sub> binding to the F1 domain modulates the properties of not only the F1 domain but also the protease domain."

The transfection experiments demonstrated that the PTHR can activate multiple signaling events in the same cell, including production of cAMP, activation of phospholipase C, and elevation of cytosolic Ca2⁺(7.Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Serge G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, this multiple signaling capability is not always present in cells that constituitively express the PTHR. In some systems, a cAMP response is observed in the absence of the cytosolic Ca2⁺ response(13.Civitelli R. Bacskai B.J. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Adams S.R. Avioli L.V. Tsein R.Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 1407-1417Google Scholar, 14.Civitelli R. Fujimori A. Bernier S. Warlow P.M. Goltzman D. Hruska K.A. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2392-2400Google Scholar), while in others the reverse appears to be true(15.Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B.R. Durkin J.P. Isaacs R.J. Jouishomme H. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Rixon R.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 299-303Google Scholar). In addition, N-terminally truncated forms of PTH that do not activate adenylyl cyclase still appear to generate the cytosolic Ca2⁺ signal(16.Fujimori A. Cheng S. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3032-3039Google Scholar), and likewise cells in a cultured bone cell line desensitized to PTH with regard to the cAMP response still show a cytosolic Ca2⁺ signal(17.Bidwell J.P. Fryer M.J. Firek A.F. Donahue H.J. Heath III, H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1021-1028Google Scholar). Thus, the factors that determine signaling in different systems are not understood. The signaling systems responsible for elevation of cytosolic Ca2⁺ in response to PTH are also complex. The hormone has been reported to activate Ca2⁺ influx through a cAMP sensitive plasma membrane channel(18.Chesnoy M.D. Fritch J. Pfluegers Arch. 1989; 415: 104-114Google Scholar), but elevated cytosolic Ca2⁺ can also be observed in the absence of influx of extracellular Ca2⁺(19.Civitelli R. Reid I.R. Westbrook S. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E660-E667Google Scholar). The latter effects have been attributed to generation of InsP3 through the action of phospholipase C(20.Hruska K.A. Moskowitz D. Esbrit P. Civitelli R. Westbrook S. Huskey M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 230-239Google Scholar, 21.Coleman D.T. Bilezikian J.P. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1990; 5: 299-306Google Scholar). However, some studies suggest that production of InsP3 is not obligatory for elevation of cytosolic Ca2⁺ by PTH. It has been reported that parathyroid hormone and thrombin release intracellular calcium from different calcium stores in osteoblast-like UMR 106-H5 rat osteosarcoma cells(22.Babich M. Choi H. Johnson R.M. King K.L. Alford G.E. Nissenson A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1463-1470Google Scholar), and no effect of PTH on InsP3 was found in this study. It has also been reported that full-length hPTHR stimulated by hPTH does not increase InsP3 levels in stably transfected HK-293 cells, while some truncated forms of the receptor do express this activity (23.Schneider H. Feyen H.M.J. Seuwen K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 281-285Google Scholar). These studies indicate a need for further examination of signaling by the PTHR under conditions where different signals can be studied independently in the same cell system. The functional expression of the PTHR in Xenopus oocytes appears to offer that possibility. Specifically, the frog oocyte has a Ca2⁺-activated Cl̅ channel that is directly utilized to detect cytosolic Ca2⁺ changes (24.Snutch T.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 250-256Google Scholar, 25.McIntosh R.P. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9045-9048Google Scholar, 26.Williams J.A. McChesney D.J. Calayag M.C.

Also, the ability for direct manipulation of cytosolic contents provide a flexible system that may be used to clarify the PTH signaling system. In this paper, we demonstrate its use for examination of cytosolic Ca2⁺ signaling. Human parathyroid hormone receptor cDNA in pcDNA I vector was generously provided by Dr. G. V. Segre (Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston). D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-CPT-cAMP, c-2,3-AMP, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) were purchased from Sigma; hPTH (1-34) was from Bachem, and L-15 medium was from Life Technologies, Inc. cDNA of human parathyroid hormone receptor was subcloned into pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) at BamHI-XbaI sites for DNA injection to the oocytes. For in vitro synthesis of RNA, the subclone was linearized by XbaI, and cRNA was synthesized with T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). The RNA yield was measured by A260 and 1-10 ng of RNA was injected into each oocyte. Adult female Xenopus laevis frogs were purchased from commercial sources (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI, and African Fish Farm, South Africa). Frog was anesthetized in 0.17% MS-222 (tricaine methanesulfonate) for about 1 h. Ovarian tissue was surgically removed, and the follicular cells were removed by treatment with 2 mg/ml of collagenase in Ca2⁺-free ND96: 96 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Stage V and VI oocytes were selected and kept in 50% L-15 medium supplemented with 0.8 mM glutamine and 10 μg/ml gentamicin at 18-20°C. Injection of oocytes was performed in a Ca2⁺-free ND96 solution by an automatic Drummond microinjector. 5-10 nl of DNA or 30-40 nl of RNA solution per oocyte were injected. After injection, oocytes were transferred to 50% of L-15 medium for incubation. Electrophysiological recording was essentially as described previously(29.Dascal N. Gillo B. Lass Y. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1985; 366: 299-313Google Scholar, 30.Dascal N. Ifune C. Hopkins R. Snutch T.P. Lubbert H. Davidson N. Simon M.I. Lester H.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1986; 387: 201-209Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes placed in a recording chamber were voltage-clamped at −80 mV with two electrodes (filled with 3 M potassium chloride and having a resistance of 0.5-3 megaohms) using an Axoclamp-2A (Axon Instruments). Oocytes were superfused with ND96 containing 1.8 mM of CaCl2. hPTH (1-34) was directly applied to the bath, and 100 nM of 5-HT was applied to the oocytes by superfusion. Voltage command protocols were generated by pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments), and the resulting membrane current changes were recorded using the same program and on a chart recorder. Intracellular injection of InsP3, EGTA, cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-CPT-cAMP, and 2′,3′-cAMP were performed using an automatic Drummond microinjector, similar to that described by Lin et al.(31.Lin L.H. Leonard S. Harris R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 941-948Google Scholar). InsP3 (4.8 mM), EGTA (50 mM), cAMP (10 mM), 8-Br-cAMP (10 mM), 8-CPT-cAMP(10 mM), and 2′,3′-cAMP(10 mM) were dissolved in distilled water and back filled into the pipette (tip broken to about 5 μm diameter) of the microinjector. A few droplets of the solution were expelled out of the pipette just before the oocyte impalement to ensure a free flow of the injection pipette. A volume of 10 nl for InsP3, EGTA, cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-CPT-cAMP, or 2′,3′-cAMP was injected into individual oocytes. Oocytes were perfused with calcium-free NP96 solution during all injections. After recording, injection pipettes were examined under the microscope to ensure that the pipettes were not clogged. For InsP3 injection, shortly after injection into experimental oocytes, InsP3 was also injected into control oocytes to ensure that InsP3 was still capable of eliciting a response. Radioligand binding to expressed receptors on oocytes was performed essentially as described by Yoshii et al.(28.Yoshii K. Yu L. Mayne K.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 553-573Google Scholar). Oocytes were prewashed once in ND96 solution and transferred to 1 ml of ND96 containing 5 nM of either [3H]mesulergine or 125I-hPTH (1-34 tyrosine amide) for 90-min incubation at room temperature. Mianserin (5 μM) or hPTH (1-34) (10 μM) were used as competing ligands to define the amount of specific binding for 5-HT2C receptor or hPTH receptor, respectively. Oocytes were pooled in groups of 5 or 10 for the binding studies, which were done in duplicate. Binding was terminated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters pretreated with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed 3 times with 3.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then counted. To express the hPTHR in Xenopus oocytes, a DNA clone for the hPTHR (10.Schneider H. Feyen J.H. Seuwen K. Movva N.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 246: 149-155Google Scholar) was used. Aliquots of cDNA of the hPTHR were microinjected into the nucleus of defolliculated X. laevis oocytes. Alternatively, synthetic cRNA was in vitro transcribed from the cDNA clone and microinjected into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes. 3-4 days after cRNA or cDNA injection, stimulation with 1-34 hPTH elicited an inward current in hPTHR-injected oocytes but not in uninjected control cells (Fig. 1A). The hPTH response displays a strong homologous desensitization, as shown by a lack of response from the second hPTH stimulation following washing out the bath hPTH used in the initial stimulation (Fig. 1A, middle trace, and Fig. 1B). The responsiveness of hPTHR-expressing oocytes slowly recovers, with the size of the inward current showing a partial recovery after 6 h (Fig. 1A, bottom trace, and Fig. 1B) and a complete recovery after 12 h (data not shown). The hPTHR was consistently expressed in oocytes, whether DNA or RNA was injected. To determine whether the hPTH-induced current in oocytes requires cytosolic Ca2⁺, 500 pmol of Ca2⁺ chelator EGTA was microinjected into hPTHR expressing oocytes. This gives a final concentration of EGTA at ~0.5 mM for oocytes with an average volume of 1 μl. Stimulation with hPTH (1-34) after EGTA injection produced no responses (Fig. 2A, middle trace, and Fig. 2B), indicating that the hPTH-induced currents were completely eliminated by intracellular EGTA injection. However, the addition of 1 mM EGTA to the calcium-free ND96 superfusion solution had no effect on hPTH-induced currents (Fig. 2A, bottom trace, and Fig. 2B). This showed that the hPTHR-induced response in Xenopus oocytes is dependent on intracellular Ca2⁺ but not on extracellular Ca2⁺. The ionic selectivity of hPTH-induced currents were determined using different channel blockers. There was no effect on hPTH-induced membrane currents when in the bath solution Ca2⁺ was chelated with EGTA and, with the inclusion of Cd2⁺ as the Ca2⁺ channel blocker and 4-AP and TEA as the K⁺ channel blocker (Fig. 3A, upper trace, and Fig. 3B). However, the membrane current could be completely suppressed by using an external ND96 solution containing 1 mM niflumic acid, a Cl̅ channel blocker (Fig. 3A, lower trace, and Fig. 3B). It has been reported that reversal potential for Cl̅ channel is approximately −25 mV(35.Dascal N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 317-387Google Scholar). The hPTH-induced membrane current was also eliminated by clamping the oocytes at the holding potential of −25 mV (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that the hPTHR-induced current is mainly carried by the Cl̅ ion. It has previously been reported that PTH can activate production of cAMP in Xenopus oocytes injected with mRNA extracts from target cells that contain the PTHR message(32.Horiuchi T. Champigny C. Rabbani S.A. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4700-4705Google Scholar). Also, in some systems, cAMP has been reported to mediate desenstitization to PTH by a protein kinase A-dependent process(33.Fukayama S. Schipani E. Juppner H. Lanske B. Kronenberg H. Abou-Samra A.B. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1851-1858Google Scholar, 34.Mitchell J. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2650-2660Google Scholar). Therefore it was of interest to examine whether cAMP has any effect on the cytosolic Ca2⁺ response to PTH in our system. Intracellular injection of cAMP and cAMP analogues, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-CPT-cAMP, and 2′,3′-cAMP, did not induce any membrane current in either control oocytes not expressing the hPTHR (data not shown) or hPTHR-expressing cells (Fig. 4). These same hPTHR-expressing cells can produce an inward current by subsequent hPTH application, demonstrating that they are not desensitized to PTH by cAMP, and suggesting that the desensitization process in oocytes is not mediated by protein kinase A. Xenopus oocytes have been used widely to study membrane receptors that couple to the phospholipase C signaling pathway(24.Snutch T.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 250-256Google Scholar), since stimulation of such a receptor expressed in oocytes gives a robust inward Cl̅ current. To compare the hPTHR-induced response to that of a system that utilizes the InsP3 pathway, we also expressed a cloned serotonin receptor, the 5-HT2C receptor, that couples to the phospholipase C pathway(36.Yu L. Nguyen H. Le H. Bloem L.J. Kozak C.A. Hoffman B.J. Snutch T.P. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Lubbert H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 143-149Google Scholar). Two parameters were analyzed for time course studies of receptor-mediated membrane currents, the latency of onset and the start-peak time (Fig. 5A). The response profiles from the two receptors are very distinct from each other, with the 5-HT response being a fast and robust one, and the hPTH response showing a longer latency and a slower kinetics for start-peak time (Fig. 5, A and B). Specifically, application of 5-HT produces an almost immediate current, whereas hPTH-induced current does not commence until about 13 s after the hormone is added (Fig. 5B, top panel). The 5-HT current also develops quickly, with an average start-peak time at 4 s, whereas hPTH-induced current takes about 7 s to develop (Fig. 5B, bottom panel). These differences are statistically significant, and they suggest that the two receptors may use different signaling pathways. On average, the chloride current responses to serotonin are also larger than those to PTH. However, this quantitative difference cannot be interpreted since it could be due to one or a combination of several variables including the efficiency of expression of the receptor message, the stability of the injected nucleic acid messages, the stability of the expressed receptor in the cell membrane, the efficiency of coupling to second messenger systems, and the sensitivity and size of responsive calcium compartments. The relative levels of receptor expression were examined in ligand binding studies. We found that the levels of expression of hPTH receptor and 5-HT2C receptors were roughly comparable. The radioligand binding studies showed 2.2 × 109 and 4.2 × 109 receptors/oocyte for hPTH and 5-HT2C receptors, respectively. Thus, it is unlikely that the qualitative and quantitative differences between the PTH and the 5-HT2C systems are related to different levels of receptor expression. G protein-coupled pathways often display marked desensitization, operationally defined as a reduced response to continued or repeated stimulation of agonists. The response induced by both the hPTHR and 5-HT2C receptor show strong homologous desensitization, as the second stimulation by the same agonist produced little or no membrane current (Fig. 6A). It has been well characterized that 5-HT2C receptor uses inositol trisphosphate as the second messenger to induce calcium release from intracellular stores. To examine the possibility that hPTH induces Ca2⁺ release by activating the same Ca2⁺ release mechanism as the 5-HT2C receptor, the hPTH receptor and 5-HT2C receptor were coexpressed in oocytes. When hPTH application has caused a complete homologous desensitization, 5-HT stimulation was still effective in releasing Ca2⁺ (Fig. 6B). The results suggest that the 5-HT2C receptor and the hPTH receptor cause intracellular calcium release through distinct pathways. It has previously been proposed that the cytosolic Ca2⁺ signal for PTH is activated by InsP3(20.Hruska K.A. Moskowitz D. Esbrit P. Civitelli R. Westbrook S. Huskey M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 230-239Google Scholar). However, some studies indicate that this may not be the case in every system(23.Schneider H. Feyen H.M.J. Seuwen K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 281-285Google Scholar), and the existence of InsP3-insensitive calcium compartments that are activated by PTH has been proposed(22.Babich M. Choi H. Johnson R.M. King K.L. Alford G.E. Nissenson A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1463-1470Google Scholar). Our kinetic and desensitization data also suggest that possibility, and further experiments were designed to test it more directly by studies with microinjection of InsP3. Strong activation of the Cl̅ channel was observed upon initial injection of InsP3, but no response was observed with a second injection (Fig. 7, top trace). Thus, either the InsP3 receptor is desensitized or the Ca2⁺ pools, which respond to injected InsP3, are emptied. 5-HT and InsP3 also showed cross-desensitization as expected (Fig. 7, middle two traces), since they share the same calcium release pathway. However, in hPTH-desensitized cells, InsP3 injection still elicited an inward current, and in cells that were unresponsive to injected InsP3, a strong signal was still observed upon addition of PTH (Fig. 7, bottom two traces). Since the PTHR can activate Ca2⁺ compartments that are insensitive to injected InsP3, we examined whether PTH signaling might proceed through the cADPR pathway (44.Takasawa S. Nata K. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. Science. 1993; 259: 370-373Google Scholar, 45.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Google Scholar, 46.Lee H.C. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 134-138Google Scholar) or the recently described NAADP⁺ pathway(51.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2152-2157Google Scholar). However, we observed no effect of injection of these compounds on the Cl̅ current in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, as expected from the above results, inhibitors that block both InsP3 and cADPR signaling systems were found to have no affect on the PTH responses in oocytes (data not shown). However, unexpectedly we found that NADP⁺, thio-NADP⁺, and the NADP⁺ analogue, 3-acetylpyridine-ADP⁺, are all strong inhibitors of the cytosolic Ca2⁺ response to PTH in oocytes (Fig. 8). This inhibition persists for a few hours, but the hormone response is eventually regained. In control experiments, injection of these compounds alone had no impact on cytosolic Ca2⁺, or on oocyte responsiveness to serotonin. As with other hormone receptor systems that have been expressed in oocytes(24.Snutch T.P. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 250-256Google Scholar, 25.McIntosh R.P. Catt K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MacGregor C. Daniel K. Kobilka T.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15796-15802Google Scholar), this work shows that increases in cytosolic Ca2⁺ can be detected by activation of an endogenous Cl̅ channel. Identification of the PTHR-stimulated signal as a Cl̅ current was accomplished by its inhibition with niflumic acid and by elimination of the signal through clamping the voltage at −25 mV, the known resting potential for Cl̅ in this system. The Ca2⁺ dependence for this current is demonstrated by its inhibition with injected EGTA, and a lack of inhibition by external EGTA establishes that the signal is not mediated by extracellular Ca2⁺. The results are consistent with earlier demonstrations that the PTHR activates increases in cytosolic Ca2⁺ in wild-type and in transfected cells(7.Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Serge G.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2732-2736Google Scholar, 12.Bringhurst F.R. Jüppner H.

Earlier studies indicated that PTH can activate increases in cytosolic Ca2⁺ by a cAMP-mediated stimulation of a plasma membrane channel in some cells(18.Chesnoy M.D. Fritch J. Pfluegers Arch. 1989; 415: 104-114Google Scholar). This effect is dependent on extracellular Ca2⁺ and thus appears unlikely to be responsible for the signals we observe. The PTHR expressed in oocytes does activate production of cAMP(32.Horiuchi T. Champigny C. Rabbani S.A. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4700-4705Google Scholar), and thus a lack of any detectable affect of injected cAMP or its nonhydrolyzable analogues represents additional evidence that our signals are not mediated through this plasma membrane channel. The apparent lack of any effect of cAMP on PTH responses or desensitization are also of interest since protein kinase A has been implicated in the down-regulation of PTHR in some cultured cell systems (33.Fukayama S. Schipani E. Juppner H. Lanske B. Kronenberg H. Abou-Samra A.B. Bringhurst F.R. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1851-1858Google Scholar, 34.Mitchell J. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2650-2660Google Scholar). Further work should also examine the possible role of protein kinase C in this system, since it has also been implicated in down-regulation of PTHR(37.Ikeda K. Sugimoto T. Fukase M. Fujita T. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2901-2906Google Scholar). This work is the first demonstration of the cytosolic Ca2⁺ response to PTH in Xenopus oocytes expressing the PTHR. Earlier work with mRNA extracts from target cells for PTH demonstrated that the receptor can be expressed in oocytes, utilizing the cAMP response to measure receptor function(32.Horiuchi T. Champigny C. Rabbani S.A. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4700-4705Google Scholar, 38.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). Thus, the two primary signaling responses to PTH have now been demonstrated in this system. This is significant since cell systems that express the PTHR do not always show both responses. For example, some cultured bone cells show elevated cAMP in response to PTH, but no detectable increases in cytosolic Ca2⁺(14.Civitelli R. Fujimori A. Bernier S. Warlow P.M. Goltzman D. Hruska K.A. Avioli L.V. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 2392-2400Google Scholar), while cultured keratinocytes show a cytosolic Ca2⁺ response but no elevation in cAMP(15.Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B.R. Durkin J.P. Isaacs R.J. Jouishomme H. Sikorska M. Williams R.E. Rixon R.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 299-303Google Scholar). Also, some forms of PTH can generate one response but not the other (16.Fujimori A. Cheng S. Avioli L.V. Civitelli R. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3032-3039Google Scholar), and in one study, cells that were desensitized with regard to the cAMP response still elicited a cytosolic Ca2⁺ response (17.Bidwell J.P. Fryer M.J. Firek A.F. Donahue H.J. Heath III, H. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 1021-1028Google Scholar). The most interesting results from this work are the apparent lack of involvement of InsP3 in PTHR signaling and the inhibition of signaling by NADP⁺. The most direct interpretation of our data with regard to the role of InsP3 is that cytosolic Ca2⁺ signaling by PTHR in oocytes is not mediated by this second messenger. This interpretation is supported by several observations. First, oocytes that cannot respond to injected InsP3 still show a strong response to added PTH. Second, cells whose InsP3-sensitive Ca2⁺ stores appear to be depleted by activation of coexpressed 5-HT receptors still respond to added PTH. Third, the response to PTH is consistently slower than that to 5-HT, suggesting that signaling is through a different route, and fourth, the PTH response is strongly inhibited by NADP⁺ and related compounds, none of which have any apparent chemical or biological relationship to InsP3. An alternative interpretation is that frog oocytes possess Ca2⁺ compartments that are not accessed either by injected materials or by InsP3 generated by other receptors. Such compartments could be activated by cAMP or InsP3 released in localized sites near the PTHR, while remaining unresponsive to the injected materials or to increased concentrations of these second messengers generated by activation of other receptor systems. Although we know of no evidence for such compartments, this possibility cannot be excluded at this time. Thus, we cannot unequivocally conclude that InsP3 is not the signal for cytosolic Ca2⁺ increases triggered by the PTHR in the frog oocyte. However, at the minimum, our studies demonstrate the existence of unique Ca2⁺ compartments in oocytes that are responsive to the PTH receptor. The unique nature of these compartments is either their unresponsiveness or their inaccessibility to presently known signals and their sensitivity to NADP⁺. Although InsP3 is probably the most widely studied signal for cytosolic Ca2⁺, three alternative second messenger candidates are known: cADPR(41.Galione A. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1994; 98: 125-131Google Scholar, 42.Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Google Scholar, 43.White A.M. Watson S.P. Galione A.

None of these have yet been shown to be active in Xenopus oocytes, and there is evidence that the cADPR pathway does not function in this system(39.Leichleiter J.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1992; 69: 283-294Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that acetylcholine and thyrotropin-releasing hormone mobilize calcium from functionally separate stores in Xenopus oocytes(40.Shapira H. Lupu-Meiri M. Gershengorn M.C. Oron Y. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 1281-1285Google Scholar), although the signaling systems for these two responses have not been identified. In the present work, we were unable to demonstrate responses of frog oocytes to either injected cADPR or NAADP⁺, but we have not yet examined the sphingosine-phosphate pathway. The inhibition of PTHR signaling by NADP⁺ has not been described previously. This effect is not observed with the serotonin receptor, which is known to utilize the InsP3 pathway, and it thus provides further evidence that InsP3 may not be the signal for the PTH system. It is of interest that the most sensitive assay for PTH is based on a procedure that requires activation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and production of NADPH(52.Goltzman D. Henderson B. Loveridge N. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 1309-1317Google Scholar). The biochemical rationale for this assay is not understood, but our results with NADP⁺ now provide further impetus for examination of the possible role of this coenzyme in biochemical actions of PTH. As indicated in Fig. 8, the inhibition of cytosolic Ca2⁺ signaling is acute and persists for hours following injection of NADP⁺. This effect could be the result of direct interaction of NADP⁺ with some regulatory element in the PTH signaling pathway or a more general effect of a significant alteration of the NADP⁺/NADPH ratio in the cytoplasm and its subsequent impact on the oxidation/reduction or catabolic/anabolic state of the cell. It may be that the signaling by PTHR is modulated by metabolic state since this hormone is known to produce both anabolic and catabolic affects on different cell types under different conditions. Further study of the regulation of signaling by the PTHR in the frog oocyte system may shed light on these possibilities. We thank Joyce Hurley and Dr. Anton Mestek for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2026070183,"Several analogs of glycinamide ribonucleotide and phosphoribosylamine have been prepared and evaluated as substrates for glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase purified from chicken liver. Glycinamide ribonucleotide analogs include side chain modifications wherein the glycine side chain (R = CH2NH2) has been replaced by R = CH2NHCH3 and R = CH2CH2NH2, ribose ring replacement by chiral cyclopentane and cyclopentene derivatives, and phosphate replacement by phosphonates. All of these, with the exception of the O-phosphonate, served as substrates for the reverse enzymatic reaction, with Vmax values comparable to that obtained with glycinamide ribonucleotide, although the Km values ranged from 21 to 118 times the Km for glycinamide ribonucleotide. Analogs of phosphoribosylamine examined as substrates for the forward reaction consist of chiral derivatives of cyclopentane and cyclopentene and a chiral carbocyclic phosphonate. These also served as substrates, with Km values ranging from 5 to 23 times the Km for phosphoribosylamine and with diminished Vmax values. These studies have begun to define the structural features of the nucleotide substrate necessary to support enzymatic activity. Sarcosine (N-methylglycine) and beta-alanine were also accepted as substrates, albeit with reduced affinity compared with glycine."
https://openalex.org/W2089256000,"Recently, Kalvakolanu et al. (Kalvakolanu, D. V. R., Liu, J., Hanson, R. W., Harter, M. L., and Sen, G. C.(1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 2530-2536) showed that E1A inhibited the basal and cAMP-stimulated transcription of the gene for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This inhibition was mediated by the conserved region 1 (CR1) domain of E1A, which has been shown by other laboratories to bind to the cellular transcriptional adaptor proteins, p300 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP). The PEPCK gene promoter contains a functional cAMP-response element, through which CREB and, therefore, CBP modulate transcription, and a consensus p300 DNA binding sequence is also present in a distal protein binding site of the promoter. We hypothesized that E1A might inhibit PEPCK gene transcription by binding to p300 and/or CBP. Surprisingly, we found that E1A consistently stimulated basal transcription from the PEPCK promoter in transfection assays in adenovirus (Ad)-infected HepG2 hepatoma cells or E1A-expressing, stably transfected 3T3 fibroblasts and nuclear run-on assays in Ad-infected H4IIE hepatoma cells. E1A also enhanced the stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription by Bt2cAMP. In transfection assays, wild type Ad5 expressing both 243R and 289R forms of E1A or a mutant virus expressing the 289R form alone stimulated transcription from the PEPCK promoter by approximately 5-fold 20 h postinfection. However, no stimulation was observed in cells infected with a virus expressing either the 243R protein alone or a 289R protein from which conserved region 3 (CR3) was mutated. Mutation or deletion of CR1 of E1A had no significant effect on transcription from the PEPCK promoter. Mutations within conserved region 2 (CR2) of E1A that inhibit the binding of E1A to the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) further enhanced the stimulation of transcription from the PEPCK promoter by 2-3-fold compared with wild type E1A. These findings suggested that the normal function of pRb is to stimulate PEPCK gene transcription, and that this process is inhibited by the binding of E1A to pRb. This hypothesis was confirmed by overexpressing pRb in HepG2 cells, which stimulated transcription from the PEPCK promoter. Our findings indicate that Ad E1A regulates PEPCK gene transcription through a stimulatory mechanism involving CR3, and by attenuating a stimulatory effect of pRb through CR2.

S. A. 1988; 85: 2974-2978Google Scholar, 22.Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Haigler H.T. Parra C. Burns A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21207-21215Google Scholar) or modulation of ion channels(23.Diaz-Munoz M. Hamilton S.L. Kaetzel M.A. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15894-15899Google Scholar), and membrane attachment of cytoskeletal elements(24.Glenney J.R. Tack B. Powell M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 503-511Google Scholar, 25.Gerke V. Weber K. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 227-233Google Scholar, 26.Ikebuchi N.W. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3392-3400Google Scholar). During the course of investigating cyclic inositol phosphate metabolism, we reinvestigated the putative identity of cIPH as annexin III(13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar). Evidence provided in this paper, when taken in conjunction with data already reported in the literature, clearly support our conclusion that annexin III and cIPH are two different proteins. Inositol dehydrogenase, bathophenanthroline, inositol, cyclic inositol monophosphate, and NAD+ were obtained from Sigma; phenazine was from Aldrich; ferric chloride was from Mallinckrodt; rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat spleen annexin III was a gift from Dr. John Dedman, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; and rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against human neutrophil annexin III was a gift from Dr. Joel Ernst, University of California at San Francisco. All other reagents and chemicals used were of analytical grade. Kidney and spleen were obtained from Sprague-Dawley male rats (100-150 g), guinea pig tissues were obtained from male albino (350-450 g), and human placenta following normal delivery. Two cyclic inositol phosphohydrolase assays were performed; one using a radioactive substrate and the other a nonradioactive cIP substrate. Principles underlying the methods are similar to that described in (12.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar), with some modifications. Tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris, 20 mM MES, pH 7.8, containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM benzamidine, 3 mM sodium azide, 1 mg/liter aprotinin, and 0.25 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Protein (20-100 μg) was incubated with cIP and alkaline phosphatase (120 milliunits) in 20 mM Tris, 10 mM MgCl2 (pH 8.3) buffer in a Microfuge tube (total incubation volume 290 μl). cIP concentration in radioactive and nonradioactive assays were 55 μM and 135 μM, respectively. Incubation was terminated by the addition with 0.8 ml of Dowex-formate resin (radioactive assay) or 0.5 ml of 50% w/v Dowex-formate resin (nonradioactive assay). Tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. Inositol present in the supernatant was determined either by counting radioactivity in the supernatant following addition of scintillation fluid or by the colorimetric method described below. Inositol level in the supernatant was determined colorimetrically by a slight modification of the method described by Dolhofer and Wieland(27.Dolhofer R. Wieland O.H. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1987; 25: 733-736Google Scholar). Assay was carried out in a 96-well plate, and absorbances were read at 550 nm by Ceres 900 plate reader. Color reagent was freshly prepared by mixing 2:2:1 by volume of NAD+ (16.5 mg/ml in 1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0), bathophenanthroline (9.8 mg/ml in ferric chloride 4 mM), and phenazine methosulfate (0.019 mg/ml in water). Inositol dehydrogenase was prepared by dissolving 10 units in 20 μl of 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and aliquoted into 2-μl fractions and stored at −20°C. Standard (50 μl containing 0-3 nmol) or unknown inositol samples were added to wells of the 96-well plate, followed by water to give a total volume of 150 μl. After addition of 50 μl of color agent, reaction was started by the addition of inositol dehydrogenase (0.005 unit in 10 μl). Assay was carried out at room temperature and absorbance was read at 550 nm after 18 h. Protein samples were separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE. Laemmli buffer (5×) was added to the protein sample and immersed into boiling water bath for 5 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE polyacrylamide gel with a 6% stacking gel, under constant current conditions. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Immunodetection was performed with either polyclonal rabbit antibody to rat annexin III (1:500 dilution) or polyclonal antibody to human annexin III at (1:5000 dilution). A nonimmune serum was used as control at appropriate dilution. Binding was detected by Bio-Rad alkaline phosphatase kit. Immunohistochemical staining was done by methods similar to that described previously(28.Myers R.B. Kudlow J.E. Grizzle W.E. Mod. Pathol. 1993; 6: 733-737Google Scholar). Briefly, immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-μm thick paraffin sections of rat kidney and spleen. Slices were incubated with either 1% rabbit serum or annexin III antibody (1:400 dilution) for 30 min at 37°C in a humidity chamber. Following removal of the excess antibody by washing, antibody was localized using an anti-rabbit ABC peroxide kit from Dako, Catalog No. 685. Addition of calcium has been shown to precipitate phospholipid-binding proteins in several different tissues and cells (29.Hullin F. Raynal P. Ragab-Thomas J.M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3506-3513Google Scholar) and has been used in the purification of annexins(30.Salles J-P. Gayral-Taminh M. Fauvel J. Delobbe I. Mignon-Conte M. Conte J.J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12805-12811Google Scholar, 31.Wirl G. Schwartz-Albiez R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 144: 511-522Google Scholar). As annexin III precipitation has not been reported under similar conditions, therefore, we investigated the effect of calcium on the precipitability of annexin III and cIPH. To 250 ml of the cytosolic extract of guinea pig kidney and human placenta, calcium (3 mM final concentration) was added and stirred at 4°C for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of cytosolic buffer. cIPH activity and annexin III by Western blot were determined in cytosol, supernatant, and the pellet. Western blot with annexin III antibody to rat spleen shows a strong signal with rat spleen but no detectable band is observed in rat kidney and medulla (Fig. 1A). This is in complete contrast to the cIPH activity in the same tissues (Fig. 1B). The specific activity of cIPH in rat spleen was 1 nmol/mg of protein/min, and that in rat kidney medulla and cortex was 10- and 21-fold higher than that of spleen. Immunohistochemistry of annexin III with rat spleen antibody shows intense staining in rat spleen all across the red pulp (marked by arrows, Fig. 2, A and B). The red pulp is that area of the spleen that is composed of a network of stromal cords and vascular sinusoids lined with endothelial cells and containing numerous macrophages. In contrast in rat kidney, there is a very weak staining in the Bowman's capsule of glomerulus (Fig. 2C, marked by arrows) and in the collecting duct region of renal medulla (Fig. 2D, marked by arrows).Figure 2:Immunostaining of rat spleen and kidney cortex and medulla with annexin III antibody.

Presence of annexin III on the Western blot is consistent with the earlier report indicating that 1% of the cytosolic protein in neutrophil is annexin III(32.Ernst J.D. Hoye E. Blackwood R.A. Jaye D J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1065-1071Google Scholar). Interestingly, while significant cIPH activity is present in both guinea pig kidney and human placenta, no cIPH activity is detected in human neutrophil (Fig. 3B). This observation further dissociates cIPH activity from annexin III. Annexin III from both guinea pig kidney and spleen, on SDS-gel electrophoresis consistently (five different experiments) migrate slightly slower than the annexin III obtained from human neutrophil and placenta (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, a slower migrating form of annexin III has also been observed in human monocytes(33.Le Cabec V. Russo-Marie F. Maridonneau-Parini I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1471-1476Google Scholar). Guinea pig annexin III appears to be immunologically distinct from rat annexin III, as rat spleen annexin III antibody fails to recognize annexin III in either guinea pig spleen or kidney (data not shown). The first step in the purification of cIPH by Ross et al. (13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar) employed separation on an HPLC anion exchange column. We injected 10 mg of crude cytosolic protein from human placenta (Fig. 4) and guinea pig kidney (Fig. 5) on perceptive anion exchange column. Fractions adjacent to the cIPH activity fractions were probed on Western blot with annexin III antibody. Under these experimental conditions, placental annexin III and cIPH activity appeared in the same fractions (Fig. 4), whereas in guinea pig kidney, fractions containing cIPH activity did not show any annexin III binding on the Western blot (Fig. 5). This indicates that placental annexin III has ion exchange chromatographic characteristics similar to that of cIPH, and, therefore, a different approach is required to dissociate these two proteins.Figure 5:Fractionization of guinea pig kidney cytosol by ion exchange chromatography. Guinea pig kidney cytosol (10 mg of protein) was injected onto a perceptive ion exchange chromatography (POROS HQ/H) attached to a Biosprint HPLC, conditions identical with that in Fig. 4. Fractions 5 to 16 (0.5-min fractions) were assayed for both annexin III and cIPH activity. A, annexin III Western blot. L and S refer to the original sample prior to injection and the standard annexin III, respectively. B, cIPH activity of the ion exchange fractions by radioactive method. 100 μl of the fraction were incubated with 55 μM labeled cIP for 60 min. Results are shown as disintegrations/min of inositol released in the supernatant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further test whether annexin III and cIPH were identical in human placenta, we employed calcium precipitation which precipitates phospholipid-binding proteins and has been used in the purification of annexin I(30.Salles J-P. Gayral-Taminh M. Fauvel J. Delobbe I. Mignon-Conte M. Conte J.J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12805-12811Google Scholar). Both guinea pig kidney cytosol and human placental cytosol contains annexin III (Fig. 6A, S) and cIPH (Fig. 6B, S). When 3 mM calcium was added to the cytosol and mixed at 4°C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g, annexin III appears almost entirely in the pellet in both guinea pig kidney and human placenta (Fig. 6A, CaP), while cIPH activity remains in the supernatant (Fig. 6B, CaS). The annexin III-enriched pellet has no cIPH activity in both guinea pig kidney and human placenta (Fig. 6B, CaP). In contrast, cIPH-enriched supernatants have little or no annexin III by immunoblot (Fig. 6A, CaS). Ross and Majerus (12.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar) in 1986 purified cIPH from human placenta and reported in 1990 that cIPH is identical with annexin III(13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar). In a later publication, they reported having expressed cyclic inositol phosphohydrolase activity by transfecting annexin III cDNA(14.Ross T.S. Whiteley B. Graham R.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9086-9092Google Scholar). Consistent with the earlier observations(10.Jungalwala F.B. Freinkel N. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1971; 123: 19-26Google Scholar, 11.Dawson R.M.C. Clarke N.G. Biochem. J. 1972; 127: 113-118Google Scholar), renal homogenate possessed significant cIPH activity (Fig. 1B), but to our surprise failed to bind rat annexin III antibody on a Western blot (Fig. 1A). The same antibody clearly recognized annexin III from rat spleen (Fig. 1A). Rat spleen, which is rich in annexin III and gives a strong positive signal both on Western blot and immunohistochemical staining with annexin III antibody, has 20-fold lower cIPH activity compared to the kidney. The above results were fully consistent with what was reported in the literature. In an earlier study (17.Kaetzel M.A. Hazarika P. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14463-14470Google Scholar) (where annexin III has been referred to as calcimedin 35-α), a significant amount of annexin III could be detected on a Western blot of rat spleen, but none could be detected on the Western blot of rat kidney. The above discrepancy in the relative distribution of cIPH and annexin III, as well as the fact that none of the groups working with annexin III have independently confirmed the cIPH activity of annexin III, raised the possibility that cIPH may have been misidentified as annexin III. A closer look at the original (12.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar, 13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar) purification scheme suggests that the first ion exchange chromatography step may have had poor resolution capacity. In the study of Ross and Majerus(12.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar), 816 mg of human placental cytosol protein was loaded on a Bio-Gel TSK DEAE 5 PW HPLC anion exchange column. Even though it is a preparative column, the total load was severalfold higher than the maximum column capacity for that column. Direct loading of such a large amount of the crude preparation, without preliminary purification, on an HPLC will likely lead to poor resolution. When we loaded 10 mg of crude cytosolic placental protein (the maximum capacity for this column) onto a perceptive ion exchange column, to determine whether it is able to resolve annexin III and cIPH, human placental annexin III and cIPH appeared in the same fractions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, under identical conditions, in guinea pig kidney, annexin III cannot be detected in Western blot in fractions demonstrating cIPH activity (Fig. 5). In their original report, Ross et al.(13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar) identified the cIPH activity as annexin III based on a single Western blot following final purification, with polyclonal antibody generated against a 12-amino acid amino-terminal peptide of annexin III. One of the well established properties of annexins is that they precipitate with calcium. When guinea pig kidney cytosol and human placental cytosol were treated with calcium, cIPH activity remained in the supernatant, while annexin III is seen in the pellet (Fig. 6). But the pellet containing annexin III had no cIPH activity. We suggest that misidentification of cIPH as annexin III resulted because human placenta contains both cIPH and annexin III in cytosol, which comigrated during purification (not unusual), and the purification procedure did not employ any specific step to deplete annexin III. We have no logical explanation for the small cIPH activity (0.02 μmol/min/mg of protein) reported with purified annexin III (13.Ross T.S. Tait J.F. Majerus P.W. Science. 1990; 248: 605-607Google Scholar) or the small amount of activity detected following transfection of Swiss 3T3 cells with the cDNA of annexin III(14.Ross T.S. Whiteley B. Graham R.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9086-9092Google Scholar). As the assay conditions used in the transfections studies (14.Ross T.S. Whiteley B. Graham R.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9086-9092Google Scholar) were reported to be similar to their original paper(12.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11119-11123Google Scholar), we can make the following calculations from their work. The total amount of substrate, based on a final substrate concentration of 75 μM and the incubation volume of 25 μl, was 1.87 nmol of cIP. In the only time course reported(14.Ross T.S. Whiteley B. Graham R.A. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9086-9092Google Scholar), the annexin III transfected cells were reported to generate 30 nmol of inositol monophosphate per mg of protein, over the entire incubation period of 120 min. If we assume they used 0.3 mg of protein (based on Fig. 1 of (15.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19924-19928Google Scholar)), this amounts to 9 nmol of cIP being hydrolyzed during the 120-min incubation, which is 5-fold higher than the total cIP present at the beginning of the incubation. These calculations make it highly unlikely that they were measuring true cIPH activity. Neutrophil provides an interesting test case. If annexin III indeed possessed cIPH activity, one would expect a very high level of cIPH activity in neutrophils, as 1% of the neutrophil cytosolic protein is annexin III(32.Ernst J.D. Hoye E. Blackwood R.A. Jaye D J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1065-1071Google Scholar). In a single observation, Ross and Majerus (34.Ross T.S. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 851-856Google Scholar, 35.Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Google Scholar) reported that neutrophils have a cIPH activity of 12,000 pmol/min/mg of protein, which would be consistent with the above hypothesis. However, the authors do not describe the exact conditions used for this single point measurement. If we assume that incubation conditions were similar to those described earlier (10-min incubation in the presence of 0.3 mg of protein), it would result in consumption of 36,000 pmol of substrate during the course of this incubation, 19-fold higher substrate than what was actually provided at the beginning of the assay. In our hands, three different experiments with neutrophils (Fig. 2) as well as time course studies (data not shown) detected no cIPH activity, which is consistent with our finding that annexin III and cIPH are two different proteins. Further support for such a conclusion is obtained from the work of Riddle et al.( 2S. Riddle, J. Besaco, and M.-D. Tsai, personal communication.) where overexpression of the gene coding annexin III in Escherichia coli is not accompanied by enhanced cIPH activity. Annexin III is much better characterized protein (36.Pepinsky R.B. Tizard R. Mattalinano R.J. Sinclair L.K. Miller G.T. Browning J.L. Chow E.P. Burne C. Huang K.S. Pratt D. Wachter L. Hession C.

Chem. 1988; 263: 10799-10811Google Scholar) than cIPH, and this #x0201C;presumed identity” between cIPH and annexin III has dampened progress in understanding the role of cIPH and cyclic inositol phosphate metabolism. The importance of our finding is that it paves the way for purification, characterization, cloning, and determining the real sequence of cIPH. Such studies should provide impetus to clarify the role of cIPH in kidney and placenta as well as determine its significance in cell growth and proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W1994134680,"We reported previously that the potency of heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) as a mitogen for rat hepatocytes in primary culture is as high as that of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor. To gain insight into the pathophysiological significance of FGF-1 in hepatocyte growth, we analyzed the cooperative mitogenicity of FGF-1 and EGF. Results from a nuclear labeling assay using [3H]thymidine suggest that most hepatocytes in primary culture consist of two cell populations that differ in response to FGF-1; one is an FGF-1-responsive cell population, and the other is an EGF-responsive (but not FGF-1-responsive) cell population. On the other hand, autoradiographic analysis of 125I-FGF-1 binding demonstrated that high affinity FGF receptors were homogeneously distributed on the surface of all hepatocytes. Cross-linking 125I-FGF-1 to the nonstimulated hepatocyte surface indicated that the high affinity FGF receptors comprise two FGF receptors that differ in molecular mass (128 and 79 kDa). Furthermore, the 79-kDa receptor was preferentially down-regulated when the hepatocytes were stimulated with EGF or hepatocyte growth factor. These data suggest that the abundant expression of the 79-kDa FGF receptor on some populations of hepatocytes is involved in their lack of response to FGF-1. The 128- and 79-kDa FGF receptors were assigned as FGFR2 using an antibody specific to the ectodomain of FGFR2, whereas the 79-kDa receptor was not reactive to the antibody against the carboxyl terminus of FGFR2. This 79-kDa FGF receptor was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FGF-1 stimulation, while the 128-kDa FGF receptor was recognized by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody under the same conditions. Also, the heterodimer of 79- and 128-kDa FGF receptors was less tyrosine-phosphorylated than the homodimer of 128-kDa FGF receptors. These data suggest that the 79-kDa FGF receptor inhibits the function of the 128-kDa FGF receptor through their heterodimerization. Thus, we surmise that the difference in response to FGF-1 between the cell populations of normal rat hepatocytes was caused by the different levels of the 79-kDa FGF receptor in each cell population.

In agreement with the consequence in vitro, TGF-α (which acts through the EGF receptor) and HGF may contribute to the proliferation of liver parenchymal cells during regeneration in vivo(1.Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Google Scholar, 2.Bucher N.L. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1991; 6: 615-624Google Scholar). We previously reported that the mitogenic activity of heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) in rat hepatocytes is comparable to that of EGF and HGF in vitro(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar, 5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar). In addition, Kan et al.(6.Kan M. Huang J. Mansson P.-E. Yasumitsu H. Carr B. McKeehan W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7432-7436Google Scholar) reported that the expression of FGF-1 mRNA is immediately induced in the remnant of rat liver after partial hepatectomy, prior to the induction of TGF-α and HGF mRNAs(7.Mead J.E.

Nature. 1989; 342: 440-443Google Scholar). These observations suggest that FGF-1 also promotes the growth of liver parenchymal cells during liver regeneration; however, the significance of FGF-1 in the proliferation of liver parenchymal cells has remained unknown. In this study, we examined the contribution of two potent mitogens, FGF-1 and EGF, to hepatocyte growth in vitro and found that the simultaneous addition of FGF-1 and EGF had a spatiotemporal additive effect upon DNA synthesis. These results suggest that the mitogenicity of FGF-1 in rat hepatocytes is mediated by an FGF-1-responsive cell population, which differs from an EGF-responsive cell population. transforming growth factor-α epidermal growth factor hepatocyte growth factor heparin-binding fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis radioimmune precipitation assay keratinocyte growth factor. Furthermore, to clarify the cause of this difference in mitogenicity of FGF-1 between these hepatocyte subpopulations, we characterized the FGF receptors on rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The well characterized FGF receptor family consists of two categories as follows: (i) four types of high affinity FGF receptors (FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) that are 110-150-kDa transmembrane protein-tyrosine kinases with two or three immunoglobulin-like loops and an acidic domain in the extracellular region (9.Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar, 10.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Google Scholar) and (ii) low affinity FGF-binding sites (synonymous with heparan sulfate proteoglycans) that play an important role in the binding of FGF to the high affinity FGF receptors(10.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Google Scholar, 11.Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). Since exogenous heparin can mimic the function of the low affinity FGF-binding sites for FGF-1 (5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar) as well as FGF-2(11.Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar), we concluded that the difference in mitogenicity of FGF-1 between hepatocyte subpopulations was not caused by the quantity and/or nature of the heparan sulfate chains on the cell surface when heparin was added to the culture medium. We therefore presume that the difference in mitogenicity of FGF-1 between hepatocyte subpopulations is due to signal transduction via the high affinity FGF receptor. The high affinity FGF receptor is essential for growth promotion by FGF stimulation(9.Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Google Scholar, 10.Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Google Scholar, 12.Fantl W.J. Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Google Scholar). After binding of FGFs, the high affinity FGF receptors form a dimeric complex(13.Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Google Scholar, 14.Ueno H. Gunn M. Dell K. Tseng Jr., A. Williams L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1470-1476Google Scholar); tyrosine kinase in the FGF receptor is activated; and then the signal for growth promotion is transduced through the phosphorylation of some proteins including the high affinity FGF receptor itself(15.Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1857-1865Google Scholar). In this study, we detected two forms (128 and 79 kDa) of FGFR2 on rat hepatocytes. The 79-kDa FGF receptor was not activated by FGF-1 stimulation and inhibited the function of the 128-kDa FGF receptor. In addition, it was suggested that the 79-kDa FGF receptor was abundantly expressed in the cell population that lacked a responsiveness to FGF-1. Thus, the roles of the 79-kDa FGF receptor are discussed in relation to its involvement in the difference in mitogenicity of FGF-1 between rat hepatocyte subpopulations. Adult rat (7-9-week-old female Wistar) hepatocytes were isolated by perfusing the liver in situ with 0.05% (w/v) collagenase as reported (16.Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 391-398Google Scholar), and morphologically identified hepatocytes constituted >95% of the preparation. These hepatocytes were plated at 2 × 104 cells/0.25 ml/cm2 in collagen (type I)-coated 24-well plates with or without coverslips and cultured in Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10-7M dexamethasone under 5% CO2 in air at 37°C(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar, 5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar). Five hours after cell seeding, the medium was replaced with basal medium (Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10-7M dexamethasone, and 10-7M insulin) with or without growth factors (FGF-1, HGF, and/or EGF). DNA synthesis was determined by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine (ICN) into DNA. The hepatocytes were labeled for 24 h with [3H]thymidine (9.25 kBq/ml, 6.18 GBq/mmol) 30 h after cell seeding, and the radioactivity level was determined using a liquid scintillation counter as reported(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar, 5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar). To assay the rate of DNA synthesis, the cultures were pulse-labeled for 3 h with [3H]thymidine (37 kBq/ml, 24.8 GBq/mmol) and harvested at the end of the labeling period to determine DNA synthesis as described(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar, 5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar). For autoradiography, [3H]thymidine (37 kBq/ml, 24.8 GBq/mmol) was added to the cultures 30 h after cell seeding. After 24 h, the cultures were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed, and processed as described(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar, 5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar). Recombinant human FGF-1 was labeled with 125I using immobilized lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase (Enzymobeads, Bio-Rad) as described(5.Tanahashi T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 233-240Google Scholar, 17.Friesel R. Burgess W.H. Mehlman T. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7581-7584Google Scholar). The specific activity of 125I-FGF-1 was ~1-3 × 105 cpm/ng as determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation(18.Vale R.D. Shooter E.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 21-39Google Scholar), and the total 125I-FGF-1 recovered was >20%. 125I-FGF-1 was stored at 4°C and used within 2 weeks. Rat hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 24-well plates and cultured as described above. Five or thirty hours after cell seeding, 125I-FGF-1 binding to the hepatocytes was assayed on ice as described(19.Kan M. DiSorbo D. Hou J. Hoshi H. Mansson P.-E. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11306-11313Google Scholar), including heparin extraction to eliminate 125I-FGF-1 binding to low affinity FGF-binding sites. Finally, the cells were solubilized with 1 N NaOH, and the radioactivity of bound 125I-FGF-1 was determined using a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 200-fold excess of nonradiolabeled recombinant human FGF-1. Heparin was added to 125I-FGF-1 and nonradiolabeled FGF-1 at an FGF-1/heparin ratio of 1:500 (w/w). The dissociation constant and the number of binding sites were determined according to Scatchard(20.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Google Scholar), and the protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford(21.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Rat hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated polystyrene coverslips (Celldesk, Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) in basal medium. Thirty hours after seeding, the cells were washed with 500 μl of binding buffer (PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol). The cells were incubated on ice for 4 h in 250 μl of binding buffer containing 100 ng/ml 125I-FGF-1 and 50 μg/ml heparin and then washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. To measure nonspecific binding, a 200-fold excess of nonradiolabeled recombinant human FGF-1 was added. After incubation in 500 μl of binding buffer containing 250 μg/ml heparin on ice for 1 min, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde on ice for 30 min, washed, air-dried, and mounted on microscope slides. The slides were dipped in photographic emulsion (NR-M2, Konika, Tokyo, Japan), exposed for 4 weeks at −80°C, developed with Kodak D-19, fixed, and stained with 0.2% eosin Y. The silver grains in single cells were scored under a light microscope, and the size of each cell was estimated using a microscopic cross-sectioned micrometer. The background silver grains were scored in an area where hepatocytes did not adhere. The significance of the difference between total and nonspecific binding was examined by Welch's t test because the variances of both types of binding differed in the F-test. The distribution of both types of binding was analyzed by testing the goodness-of-fit to the normal distribution. Rat hepatocytes in basal medium were incubated in 6-cm tissue culture dishes coated with collagen. Thirty hours after cell seeding, the cells were washed twice with 5 ml of binding buffer and incubated for 4 h on ice in 2 ml of binding buffer containing 10 ng/ml 125I-FGF-1 and 5 μg/ml heparin. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min in PBS containing the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (1 mM). The cross-linking reaction was stopped with 0.2 ml of stop buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.3, 0.2 M glycine, 2 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μMtrans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64)). After decanting the mixture, 1 ml of PBS, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μM E-64 was added, and the cells were scraped and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were solubilized in 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer (0.12 M Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli(22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). All samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 7% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to verify that all samples contained approximately equal amounts of protein. After drying, the gels were autoradiographed and examined using a Fuji BA-100 radioimage analyzer. Rat hepatocytes were incubated in Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 10-7M dexamethasone in 6-cm culture dishes for 2 h; sodium orthovanadate (50 μM) was then added, and the cells were further cultured for 3 h. After washing twice with cold Williams' E medium (10 ml), the cells were incubated on ice for 4 h in basal medium supplemented with 30 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 ng/ml 125I-FGF-1, and 5 μg/ml heparin. Following 125I-FGF-1 binding, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 5 min. After washing twice with 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate in PBS, the cells were incubated on ice for 30 min in PBS containing 1 mM disuccinimidyl suberate and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mM sodium fluoride, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 5 mM EDTA). The cross-linking reaction was terminated with stop buffer. The 125I-FGF-1-cross-linked hepatocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μM E-64) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors at 4°C for 30 min, and the lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. After incubation with wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose 6MB (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at 4°C for 10 h, the adsorbed proteins were washed five times with RIPA buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors. The proteins bound on the beads were boiled in 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer and separated on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thereafter, autoradiographs were examined using a Fuji BAS-2000 radioimage analyzer. Rat hepatocytes were cultured for 5 h and cross-linked with 125I-FGF-1 as described under #x0201C;Cross-linking of 125I-FGF-1 to Rat Hepatocyes”. The cross-linked hepatocytes were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer at 4°C for 30 min. The lysate obtained by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min) was cleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Following incubation with 5 μg of anti-FGFR polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) that recognize the respective peptides consisting of 15-17 residues in each carboxyl-terminal region of FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4 at 4°C for 4 h, the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer and boiled in 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer before electrophoresis (7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel). Autoradiographs were obtained as described above. Rat hepatocytes were plated in collagen-coated 6-cm culture dishes, and the medium was replaced with methionine-free Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10-7M insulin, and 10-7M dexamethasone 5 h after cell seeding. The cells were incubated with [35S]methionine (3.7 MBq/ml) 7 h after cell seeding. Thirty hours after cell seeding, the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer at 4°C for 30 min. The cell lysate was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The lysate containing 3 × 106 dpm of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts was cleared with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After incubation at 4°C for 10 h with 2 μl of anti-FGFR antisera (the kind gifts of Drs. M. Kan and W. L. McKeehan, Texas A & M University) that recognize each ectodomain of FGFR2 and FGFR4, the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer and boiled in 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (7% gel) and detected by fluorography using Enlightning (DuPont NEN). Rat hepatocytes were cultured for 5 h, cross-linked with 125I-FGF-1, and lysed as described under #x0201C;Dimerization of FGF Receptors on Rat Hepatocytes”. The cell lysates were cleared with protein-A Sepharose beads and then incubated with 5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) at 4°C for 8 h. The immunocomplexes were adsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads and washed five times with RIPA buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. The complexes bound to the beads were boiled in 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer, separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and autoradiographed as described above. Human heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF)-1α was used as recombinant human FGF-1(23.Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier A.M. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Google Scholar). Recombinant human HGF was a gift of Dr. Yasufumi Sato (Oita Medical School, Oita, Japan). FBS was purchased from Irvine Scientific. Mouse EGF, insulin, dexamethasone, and heparin were from Sigma. Collagenase was from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). We previously reported that the mitogenic effects of EGF and recombinant human FGF-1 supplemented with heparin on the DNA synthesis of rat hepatocytes in primary culture are essentially equivalent(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar). To clarify the significance of these two growth factors on hepatocyte growth, we examined the combinational effects of EGF and FGF-1 by measuring the time course of DNA synthesis by rat hepatocytes. In the presence of either FGF-1 or EGF, DNA synthesis by rat hepatocytes in primary culture became relatively synchronized (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows that the first and main peak of [3H]thymidine incorporation appeared 30-54 h after seeding in both EGF- and FGF-1-stimulated cells and that some minor peaks appeared thereafter. The time courses of the response to each growth factor were similar, and the stimulation of DNA synthesis by each growth factor was comparable throughout the first S phase. Furthermore, the effect of EGF and FGF-1 on DNA synthesis in hepatocytes was additive at almost all points during the first peak. The populations of hepatocytes that were stimulated by various concentrations of FGF-1 and/or EGF were determined by labeling the nuclei with [3H]thymidine. As shown in Table 1, EGF and FGF-1 individually induced ~55% labeling of hepatocyte nuclei at 10 ng/ml, the concentration at which each growth factor exerted their maximal activities as described(4.Tanahashi T. Imamura T. Suzuki M. Mitsui Y. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1994; 30A: 139-141Google Scholar). Even when the concentration of each growth factor was increased up to 100 ng/ml, the labeling indices were not increased. However, the number of nuclei labeled by a combination of these growth factors was enhanced to 80% at a 10 ng/ml concentration of each growth factor. The labeling indices were not changed by increasing the concentration of FGF-1 and/or EGF up to 100 ng/ml. These data indicated that 55% of the hepatocytes were responsive to FGF-1, although FGF-1 did not exert its mitogenic activity on the remaining hepatocytes.Tabled 1 To determine the cause of the difference in mitogenicity of FGF-1 described above, we characterized FGF-1 binding to hepatocytes by Scatchard analysis and microautoradiography. Specific high affinity binding was saturable at concentrations of 125I-FGF-1 above 4 nM, and it resulted in a linear Scatchard plot (Fig. 2). The apparent dissociation constant and the number of binding sites were estimated as 150-400 pM and 25-35 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. On the other hand, when the cells were not extracted with heparin, specific FGF-1 binding with an apparent dissociation constant of >1.5 nM appeared (data not shown). These data indicated that the low affinity binding sites for FGF-1 were completely eliminated by heparin extraction even when 125I-FGF-1 was added up to 7.5 nM (~120 ng/ml). For the high affinity binding sites for FGF-1 characterized above, we developed a method of detecting high affinity FGF-1-binding sites on single rat hepatocytes in primary culture. We added 125I-FGF-1 (100 ng/ml to saturate the binding of FGF-1 to its high affinity receptor) to cultured hepatocytes and then extracted them with heparin to eliminate the low affinity binding. After microautoradiography, grains on single cells were scored, and the cell area was measured under the microscope (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown in Fig. 3C, the grain density of total 125I-FGF-1 binding was distributed as one peak. This fits to the normal distribution, which had a mean value and standard deviation of 10.36 ± 2.20 grains/100-μm2 cell area. The grain density of the background was 0.84 ± 0.27 grains/100-μm2 cell area, and none of the cells corresponded to this background value. However, the grain density on the cells was decreased to 1.70 ± 0.72 grains/100-μm2 cell area when excess nonradiolabeled FGF-1 was added (Fig. 3D). The cell area associated with total binding was 2330 ± 830 μm2, and that with nonspecific binding was 1830 ± 680 μm2, indicating that the areas were essentially similar. Thus, the grain density of total binding was significantly greater than that of nonspecific binding (p < 0.01). To confirm the effect of EGF or HGF on FGF-1 binding, we analyzed alterations in the FGF receptor on hepatocytes stimulated with EGF or HGF by Scatchard analysis and by cross-linking 125I-FGF-1 to its receptors. The binding of 125I-FGF-1 was not competed by EGF or HGF (Fig. 4A) and was not changed by incubation in basal medium for 25 h (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) or HGF (10 ng/ml) 5-30 h after cell seeding, the number of high affinity binding sites for FGF-1 was decreased to about half (typically, from 36 to 17 fmol/mg of protein by EGF or to 23 fmol/mg of protein by HGF), whereas the apparent dissociation constant for high affinity binding of FGF-1 to hepatocytes remained the same (Fig. 4B). Two FGF receptors were found in nonstimulated hepatocytes by cross-linking (Fig. 5, lane 1). The molecular masses of these FGF receptors were estimated as 128 and 79 kDa by subtracting FGF-1 (16 kDa) from the 125I-FGF-1-cross-linked bands (144 and 95 kDa). Both bands were recognized as actual FGF-1 receptors by the disappearance of these bands in the presence of a 200-fold excess of nonradiolabeled FGF-1 (Fig. 5, lane 2). It was also indicated that the FGF receptors corresponding to both bands were not shared by EGF or HGF since EGF or HGF did not inhibit the binding of FGF-1 (Fig. 4A). Stimulation with EGF (10 ng/ml) or HGF (10 ng/ml) for 25 h reduced the intensities of both bands (Table 2). Whereas the radiointensity of the 144-kDa band was reduced to 65-75% by treatment with EGF or HGF, a greater decrease in that of the 95-kDa band was observed. As shown in Table 2, the 95-kDa band was decreased ~2-fold compared with the 144-kDa band by stimulation with EGF or HGF. These data indicated that the 95-kDa band was preferentially down-regulated by stimulation with EGF or HGF.Figure 5:Cross-linking of 125I-FGF-1 to rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Hepatocytes were cultured without (lanes 1 and 2) or with 10 ng/ml HGF (lane 3) or 10 ng/ml EGF (lane 4) 5-30 h after cell seeding. 125I-FGF-1 bound to hepatocytes in the absence (lanes 1, 3, and 4) or presence (lane 2) of a 200-fold excess of nonradiolabeled FGF-1. 125I-FGF-1 and cells were cross-linked, lysed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then the gel was visualized using a radioimage analyzer. The molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) are indicated on the left. The color bar on the right indicates the relationship between the color level and the relative intensity of the radioactivity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Tabled 1 To clarify the molecular aspects of the two FGF receptors in rat hepatocytes, we immunoprecipitated the FGFR·FGF-1 complexes using anti-FGFR antibodies that recognize the respective carboxyl-terminal domains of FGFRs. Fig. 6A shows that the anti-FGFR2 antibody immunoprecipitated the 144-kDa FGFR·FGF-1 complex, while the 95-kDa FGFR·FGF-1 complex was not recognized by this antibody (Fig. 6A). In addition, no FGFR·FGF-1 complexes were detected by immunoprecipitation with the carboxyl-terminal antibodies of FGFR1, FGFR3, and FGFR4 (Fig. 6A). These results indicated that the 128-kDa FGF receptor (corresponding to the 144-kDa FGFR·FGF-1 complex) was an FGFR2 containing its carboxyl terminus. On the other hand, the 128- and 79-kDa proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated with the antibody against the ectodomain of FGFR2 (Fig. 6B). The respective antibodies to each ectodomain of FGFR1 and FGFR4 did not recognize these 128- and 7"
https://openalex.org/W2050123606,"The binding of four monoclonal immunoglobulins, two with specificity for β(1→6)-linked D-galactopyranans (IgA X24 and IgA J539) and two with specificity for the chain terminus of α(1→6)-linked D-glucopyranans (IgA W3129 and IgA 16.4.12E), was measured with a number of their homologous oligosaccharide ligands at different temperatures. The results show a linear relationship between ln<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> and 1/<i>T</i>, where <i>K</i><sub>a</sub> is the affinity constant and <i>T</i> is the absolute temperature. The unitary free energy of binding, Δ<i>G</i><sub>u</sub>, is virtually independent of <i>T</i>, and the Δ<i>S</i><sub>u</sub> is small when compared with Δ<i>G</i><sub>u</sub>. The enthalpy changes derived from van't Hoff plots are large and negative, indicating an exothermic binding effect, whereas the entropy changes are small and negative, indicating minor overall hydrophobic contributions. Measurements of the free energies of binding, in low and high salt buffers, of methyl β-D-galactopyranoside and the methyl glycoside of β(1→6)-D-galactopyranotetraose with anti-galactan IgA X24 indicate that the monosaccharide has no hydrophobic interaction with the highest affinity subsite of IgA, whereas the tetraoside might have a modest hydrophobic interaction with the three other hapten-binding subsites of IgA. The standard entropy change of binding of the two groups (galactosyl and glucosyl) of oligosaccharides to the two respective sets (anti-galactan and anti-dextran) of antibodies shows a distinct, differing correlation with the hapten chain length within each set. This correlation agrees with the type of association previously established between the antibodies and either the interior determinants of the antigen (in the case of the anti-galactans) or the chain terminus (in the case of the anti-dextrans)."
