https://openalex.org/W2094859123,"Mice lacking p27(Kip1) have been created by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. These mice are larger than the control animals, with thymus, pituitary, and adrenal glands and gonadal organs exhibiting striking enlargement. CDK2 activity is elevated about 10-fold in p27(-/-) thymocytes. Development of ovarian follicles seems to be impaired, resulting in female sterility. Similar to mice with the Rb mutation, the p27(-/-) mice often develop pituitary tumors spontaneously. The retinas of the mutant mice show a disturbed organization of the normal cellular layer pattern. These findings indicate that p27(Kip1) acts to regulate the growth of a variety of cells. Unexpectedly, the cell cycle arrest mediated by TGFbeta, rapamycin, or contact inhibition remained intact in p27(-/-) cells, suggesting that p27(Kip1) is not required in these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2072103796,"Cellular invasion depends on cooperation between adhesive and proteolytic mechanisms. Evidence is provided that the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 can be localized in a proteolytically active form on the surface of invasive cells, based on its ability to bind directly integrin αvβ3. MMP-2 and αvβ3 were specifically colocalized on angiogenic blood vessels and melanoma cells in vivo. Expression of αvβ3 on cultured melanoma cells enabled their binding to MMP-2 in a proteolytically active form, facilitating cell-mediated collagen degradation. In vitro, these proteins formed an SDS-stable complex that depended on the noncatalytic C-terminus of MMP-2, since a truncation mutant lost the ability to bind αvβ3. These findings define a single cell-surface receptor that regulates both matrix degradation and motility, thereby facilitating directed cellular invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2116711648,"Targeted disruption of the murine p27(Kip1) gene caused a gene dose-dependent increase in animal size without other gross morphologic abnormalities. All tissues were enlarged and contained more cells, although endocrine abnormalities were not evident. Thymic hyperplasia was associated with increased T lymphocyte proliferation, and T cells showed enhanced IL-2 responsiveness in vitro. Thus, p27 deficiency may cause a cell-autonomous defect resulting in enhanced proliferation in response to mitogens. In the spleen, the absence of p27 selectively enhanced proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. p27 deletion, like deletion of the Rb gene, uniquely caused neoplastic growth of the pituitary pars intermedia, suggesting that p27 and Rb function in the same regulatory pathway. The absence of p27 also caused an ovulatory defect and female sterility. Maturation of secondary ovarian follicles into corpora lutea, which express high levels of p27, was markedly impaired."
https://openalex.org/W2083561654,"Disruption of the cyclin-dependent kinase-inhibitory domain of p27 enhances growth of mice. Growth is attributed to an increase in cell number, due to increased cell proliferation, most obviously in tissues that ordinarily express p27 at the highest levels. Disruption of p27 function leads to nodular hyperplasia in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. However, increased growth occurs without an increase in the amounts of either growth hormone or IGF-I. In addition, female mice were infertile. Luteal cell differentiation is impaired, and a disordered estrus cycle is detected. These results reflect a disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. The phenotypes of these mice suggest that loss of p27 causes an alteration in cell proliferation that can lead to specific endocrine dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1971473766,"Capacitative calcium entry (CCE) describes CA2+ influx into cells that replenishes CA2+ stores emptied through the action of IP3 and other agents. It is an essential component of cellular responses to many hormones and growth factors. The molecular basis of this form of Ca2+ entry is complex and may involve more than one type of channel. Studies on visual signal transduction in Drosophila led to the hypothesis that a protein encoded in trp may be a component of CCE channels. We reported the existence of six trp-related genes in the mouse genome. Expression in L cells of small portions of these genes in antisense orientation suppressed CCE. Expression in COS cells of two full-length cDNAs encoding human trp homologs, Htrp1 and Htrp3, increased CCE. This identifies mammalian gene products that participate in CCE. We propose that trp homologs are subunits of CCE channels, not unlike those of classical voltage-gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W1970815708,"Rhizobium lipochitooligosaccharide signal molecules stimulate multiple responses in legume host plants, including changes in host gene expression, cell growth, and mitoses leading to root nodule development. The basis for signal transduction in the plant is not known. We examined cytoplasmic free calcium in host root hairs using calcium-sensitive reporter dyes. Image analysis of injected dyes revealed localized periodic spikes in cytoplasmic calcium levels that ensued after a characteristic lag following signal application. Structural features of the signal molecules required to cause nodulation responses in alfalfa are also essential for stimulating calcium spiking. A nonnodulating alfalfa mutant is defective in calcium spiking, consistent with the possibility that this mutant is blocked in an early stage of nodulation signal perception."
https://openalex.org/W2091373076,"Position–effect variegation (PEV) describes the stochastic transcriptional silencing of a gene positioned adjacent to heterochromatin. Using FISH, we have tested whether variegated expression of the eye-color gene brown in Drosophila is influenced by its nuclear localization. In embryonic nuclei, a heterochromatic insertion at the brown locus is always spatially isolated from other heterochromatin. However, during larval development this insertion physically associates with other heterochromatic regions on the same chromosome in a stochastic manner. These observations indicate that the brown gene is silenced by specific contact with centromeric heterochromatin. Moreover, they provide direct evidence for long-range chromosome interactions and their impact on three-dimensional nuclear architecture, while providing a cohesive explanation for the phenomenon of PEV.§Present Address: Department of Developmental Biology, B300 Beckman Center, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305."

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, for example, produces activation and autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor leading to the formation of a multiprotein complex containing the phosphorylated receptor, the phosphoprotein Shc, the adaptor protein Grb2, and the Ras-GTP exchange factor Sos(7.Buday L.

In this study, we assess the role of PI-3K in the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway using two inhibitors of PI-3K activity, wortmannin (30.Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem.

Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12706-12710Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether PI-3K activity is required in the Gβγ-mediated mitogenic signaling pathway, we assessed the effect of two chemical PI-3K inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) and the effect of overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of the p85 subunit of PI-3K (Δp85) on Gi-coupled receptor- and Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment of COS-7 cells with wortmannin or LY294002 markedly inhibits MAP kinase activation produced by stimulation of the endogenously expressed LPA receptor. This inhibition of the LPA signal was also detectable at the level of endogenous MAP kinase (ERK2) (Fig. 1A, right panel). Similar inhibition by wortmannin and LY294002 is observed on MAP kinase activation provoked by stimulation of transiently overexpressed α2AR and direct transfection of Gβγ (Fig. 1B). Wortmannin and Ly294002 pretreatment also inhibit GiPCR- and Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase activation in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). In contrast, wortmannin and LY294002 have a lesser effect on MAP kinase activation stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), or epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Fig. 1B). The inhibition by wortmannin and LY294002 is limited to the MAP kinase signaling pathway, in that the PI-3K inhibitors do not affect α2AR- or Gβγ-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 1C). Both wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit LPA and Gβγ-stimulated MAP kinase activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D and E), with IC50 values of 100 nM and 1.0 μM for wortmannin and LY294002, respectively.A recent study (36.Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar) reported that expression of a dominant negative mutant of p85α (Δp85), which lacks the p110 binding site, inhibits insulin-stimulated PI-3K activity and PIP3 production. The effect of Δp85 expression on Gi-coupled receptor- and Gβγ-stimulated MAP kinase activation is shown in Fig. 2. Expression of Δp85 inhibits LPA-, α2AR-, and Gβγ-stimulated MAP kinase activation without affecting MAP kinase activation stimulated by PMA. Thus, expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI-3K produces effects similar to wortmannin and LY294002. These results strongly suggest that PI-3K activity is an essential component of the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway.Figure 2:Effect of Δp85 expression on Gi-coupled receptor- and Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase (HA-ERK1) activation. COS-7 cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNA encoding p44mapkHA−mapk (0.1 μg/well) and either pRK5 alone (2.0 μg/well), Gβ1 and Gγ2 (1.0 μg each/well), or α2AR (0.2 μg/well) or pRK5 (2.0). Cells were also cotransfected with Δp85 (2.0 μg/well) where indicated. Cells were stimulated with vehicle, LPA (10 μM), the α2AR agonist UK-14304 (10 μM), PMA (1.0 μM), or EGF (10 ng/ml) for 5 min, and MAP kinase activation was determined. The data are expressed as fold stimulation where basal MAP kinase activity is defined as 1.0. Values are mean ± S.E. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In PC12 cells, GTP-dependent association of Ras with the catalytic subunit of PI-3K has been described(23.Rodriguez Viciana P. Warne P.H. Dhand R. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Fry M.J. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. Nature. 1994; 370: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of the p85/p110 PI-3K occurs subsequent to Ras activation. In contrast, a constitutively active mutant of PI-3K stimulates Ras-dependent Xenopus oocyte maturation and fos transcription (37.Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) suggesting PI-3K activation precedes Ras activation in this system. To determine whether PI-3K activation in the Gi-coupled receptor/Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway precedes or follows Ras activation, the effect of PI-3K inhibitors on Gi-coupled receptor-mediated Ras activation was determined. As shown in Fig. 3, LPA-stimulated Ras activation is abolished by wortmannin and LY294002 pretreatment. In contrast, EGF-stimulated Ras activation is not significantly affected. The striking sensitivity of the LPA-stimulated signal to inhibition of PI-3K activity suggests a crucial role for PI-3K activity early in the Gi-coupled receptor/Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway.Figure 3:Effect of PI-3K inhibitors on LPA- and EGF-mediated Ras activation. COS-7 cells were preincubated for 15 min with wortmannin (1.0 μM), LY294002 (20 μM), or vehicle. Cells were then treated for 2 min with vehicle, LPA (10 μM), or EGF (10 ng/ml), and Ras activation was determined. Data are shown as GTP bound to Ras as a percent of the total guanyl nucleotides bound to Ras.

The effect of PI-3K inhibition on MAP kinase activation provoked by overexpression of Sos, constitutively active Ras (T24Ras), and constitutively active MEK (MEK+) in COS-7 cells was assessed. Pretreatment with wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4A) or overexpression of Δp85 (data not shown) has no effect on the increase in MAP kinase activation stimulated by Sos, T24Ras, or MEK+ (Fig. 4A), suggesting PI-3K activity is upstream of these intermediates in the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase activation pathway.Figure 4:Effect of PI-3K inhibitors on MAP kinase (HA-ERK1) activation stimulated by intermediates of the Gβγ-mediated mitogenic signaling pathway. COS-7 (A) and CHO-K1 (B) cells were cotransfected with plasmid DNA encoding p44mapkHA−mapk (0.1 μg/well) and 1.0 μg/well of Sos, T24Ras, or MEK+ (A) and Gβ1/Gγ2, Sos, or Gβ1/Gγ2 and Sos (B). Cells were pretreated for 15 min with vehicle, wortmannin (1.0 μM), or LY294002 (20 μM), and MAP kinase activity was determined. The data are expressed as fold MAP kinase activity in which the basal MAP kinase activity is defined as 1.0.

Expression of Gβγ or Sos alone stimulates a 2-3-fold and 5-fold increase, respectively, in MAP kinase activation (Fig. 4B). Coexpression of Gβγ and Sos results in a 15-20-fold increase in MAP kinase activation. As in COS-7 cells, Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase activation in CHO-K1 cells is abolished by wortmannin or LY294002 pretreatment, and Sos-stimulated MAP kinase activation is unaffected. The synergistic increase in MAP kinase activation produced by Gβγ and Sos coexpression is not observed in cells pretreated with wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the ability of Gβγ subunits to synergize with Sos is dependent on PI-3K activity, suggesting that PI-3K activity is required downstream of Gβγ, but upstream of Sos in the Gi-mediated MAP kinase activation signaling pathway.A role for PI-3K in mitogenic signaling has been suggested by previous studies showing that PI-3K can associate with activated RTKs and Src family kinases(38.Corey S. Eguinoa A. Puyana-Theall K. Bolen J.B. Cantley L. Mollinedo F. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39.Yamanashi Y. Fukui Y.

PI-3K association with the Grb2-Sos complex has been demonstrated following monocyte colony-stimulating factor stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes (41.Saleem A. Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M.

Susa M. Varticovski L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1385-1391PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PI-3K is capable of interacting with many mitogenic signaling intermediates.Several studies have suggested a role for PI-3K in GPCR-mediated signaling. Activation of neutrophils by formylated-Met-Leu-Phe involves pertussis toxin-sensitive increases in PI-3K activity and PIP3 production(25.Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T.

Increased PI-3K activity is observed in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates following activation of G protein-mediated systems(27.Stephens L. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol.

Waga I. Bito H. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The results of the present study demonstrate that PI-3K activity is required in the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway and that the site of PI-3K activity in the pathway is upstream of Sos.We have previously observed that Gβγ-mediated Shc phosphorylation is sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and wortmannin(20.Touhara K.

Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnberg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J.J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R. Science. 1995; 269: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). It is thus attractive to speculate that PI-3Kγ activity may be required for recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase(s) responsible for mediating Ras and MAP kinase activation.It has recently been reported that a product of PI-3K activity, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), is capable of binding with high affinity to the SH2 domains of proteins such as Src and the p85 subunit of PI-3K(48.Rameh L.E. Chen C.-S. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 821-830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Further, PIP3 can compete with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins for binding to these sites. The PIP3/SH2 interaction may suggest a novel mechanism for regulating signaling pathways in PI-3K-dependent systems. PIP3 may block phosphoprotein binding to SH2 domain-containing proteins or even supplant phosphoproteins bound to an SH2 domain. It is therefore possible that PIP3 may serve as an intermediate in the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway.The ability of Δp85 to inhibit Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase activation may indicate a requirement for the p85α-p110 complex in the pathway, possibly as part of a complex containing Shc and a Src family tyrosine kinase(49.Ptasznik A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19969-19973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Δp85 may inhibit the Gβγ signal by binding directly to PIP3. Binding of Δp85 to PIP3 may disrupt PI-3K-dependent signaling by preventing PIP3 from competing with phosphoproteins for binding to an SH2 domain. Therefore, it is possible that both p85-p110 PI-3K- and PI-3Kγ-dependent signaling can be inhibited by expression of Δp85. Further investigation is required to determine which PI-3K isotype is utilized in the Gβγ-mediated MAP kinase signaling pathway, the mechanism by which PI-3K activity provokes tyrosine kinase activation resulting in Shc phosphorylation and the identity of the tyrosine kinase utilized in this pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2052189375,"Drosophila phototransduction is a G protein–coupled, calcium-regulated signaling cascade that serves as a model system for the dissection of phospholipase C (PLC) signaling in vivo. The Drosophila light-activated conductance is constituted in part by the transient receptor potential (trp) ion channel, yet trp mutants still display a robust response demonstrating the presence of additional channels. The transient receptor potential-like (trpl) gene encodes a protein displaying 40% amino acid identity with TRP. Mammalian homologs of TRP and TRPL recently have been isolated and postulated to encode components of the elusive Icrac conductance. We now show that TRP and TRPL localize to the membrane of the transducing organelle, together with rhodopsin and PLC, consistent with a role in PLC signaling during phototransduction. To determine the function of TRPL in vivo, we isolated trpl mutants and characterized them physiologically and genetically. We demonstrate that the light-activated conductance is composed of TRP and TRPL ion channels and that each can be activated on its own. We also use genetic and electrophysiological tools to study the contribution of each channel type to the light response and show that TRP and TRPL can serve partially overlapping functions."
https://openalex.org/W1509408588,"Mitochondria may be primary targets of free radical damage associated with aging. We have found that mitochondrial glutathione is markedly oxidized with aging in rats and mice. The oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio rises with aging in the liver, kidney, and brain. The magnitude of these changes is much higher than that previously found in whole cells of any species previously studied. In the liver, this ratio (expressing GSSG as a percent of GSH) changed from 0.77 +/- 0.19% (n=5) in young rats to 2.47 +/- 1.25% (n=5) in old ones, i.e., 320% of the controls. In the brain and kidney, values for old rats were, respectively, 600 and 540% higher than those of young rats. A marked oxidation of mitochondrial glutathione also occurred in mice. Aging also caused an increase in 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine levels in mtDNA in rats and mice. Oral antioxidant administration protected against both glutathione oxidation and mtDNA damage in rats and mice. Finally, we have found a direct relationship between mtDNA damage and mitochondrial glutathione oxidation. This occurs both in rats (r=0.95) and in mice (r=0.98). This relationship, which has been observed for the first time in these studies, underscores the role of glutathione in the protection against free radical damage that occurs upon aging."

Extensive mutational analyses of various AREs have identified important components of the ARE, such as the nonamer motif UUAUUUAUU, two copies of which serve as a potent mRNA destabilizer. To investigate the roles of trans-acting factors in ARE-directed mRNA degradation, we previously purified and molecularly cloned the RNA-binding protein AUF1 and demonstrated that both cellular and recombinant AUF1 bind specifically to AREs as shown by UV cross-linking assays in vitro. In the present work, we have examined the in vitro RNA-binding properties of AUF1 using gel mobility shift assays with purified recombinant His6-AUF1 fusion protein.

Belasco J. Brawerman G. Belasco J. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1993: 199-218Crossref Google Scholar)). Many ARE-containing mRNAs are degraded by a sequential pathway involving removal of the poly(A) tract followed by degradation of the mRNA body(8.Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 9.Shyu A.-B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E.

In most cases the poly(A) tract is thought to protect the mRNA from ribonuclease attack so that its removal permits degradation of the mRNA body (reviewed in (11.Bernstein P. Ross J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 373-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar)). While it has been known for almost a decade that AREs are important for mRNA instability(12.Caput D. Beutler B.

Despite the presence of AREs in many different mRNAs, there is no single evolutionarily conserved A+U-rich instability sequence. Typically AREs contain multiple copies of the pentanucleotide AUUUA, often in conjunction with one or more U-rich regions(14.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar). In addition, transfection studies indicate that as the number of tandemly repeated AUUU motifs is increased in a reporter mRNA, its instability increases. Likewise, two copies of the nonameric motif UUAUUUAUU act as a more potent destabilizer than a single nonameric motif(16.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Together, these analyses suggest that potent destabilizing AREs are high affinity binding sites for a mRNA decay factor(s). In order to investigate how AREs function in mRNA turnover, we utilized a cell-free mRNA decay system to identify proteins that may be relevant to ARE-directed mRNA decay(8.Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 18.Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19.Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To this end, we previously reported the purification, molecular cloning, and characterization of the ARE-binding protein AUF1(20.Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Cellular AUF1 purified from cytoplasmic extracts of K562 human erythroid leukemia cells consists of a 37- and a 40-kDa isoform. Cloning of the 37-kDa isoform, p37AUF1, revealed two nonidentical RNA recognition motifs (21.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar) and a short glutamine-rich region in the predicted amino acid sequence. Cloning of murine cDNAs suggests that the 40-kDa isoform may also contain 19 additional amino acids N-terminal to RNA recognition motif 1(22.Ehrenman K. Long L. Wagner B.J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 149: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Both cellular and recombinant p37AUF1 (hereafter referred to as AUF1) bind the AREs present in the c-fos and c-myc proto-oncogene mRNAs and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor cytokine mRNA as shown by UV cross-linking assays in vitro. The potential influence of AUF1 on ARE-directed mRNA decay extends beyond the control of cytokine and proto-oncogene expression, however. Many mRNAs encoding components of G protein-coupled receptors, such as β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), contain AREs. Moreover, receptor levels are frequently subject to regulatory control. For example, exposure of smooth muscle cells to agonist down-regulates β2-AR mRNA levels by inducing degradation of the mRNA(23.Hadcock J.R. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19928-19933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, agonist-mediated destabilization of the human β1-AR mRNA appears to be dependent upon an ARE(24.Tremmel K.D. Pende A. Bristow M.R. Port J.D. Keystone Symposia: The Molecular Biology of the Cardiovascular System. Keystone Symposia, Silverthorn, CO1996: 47Google Scholar), and for both the human β1-AR and hamster β2-AR mRNAs decay occurs concomitantly with an increase in the cytoplasmic levels of AUF1(25.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol.

DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the reciprocal relationship between the half-life of β2-AR mRNA and the abundance of AUF1 suggests that the half-lives of ARE-containing mRNAs may be dependent in part upon ARE-specific RNA binding affinity of AUF1. Here, we test the hypothesis that the binding affinity of AUF1 for an ARE should reflect the potency of that ARE as a mRNA destabilizer. Using purified recombinant His6-AUF1 fusion protein, we find a direct relationship between the apparent Kdfor ARE binding by AUF1 and the potency of the ARE to direct mRNA decay. These results support a role for AUF1 in ARE-directed mRNA decay that is based upon its affinity for different AREs. All enzymes and plasmid vectors were obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI) unless otherwise noted. All plasmid constructions were confirmed by both restriction enzyme analyses and dideoxy sequencing with Sequenase (version 2.0, U.S. Biochemical Corp.). His6-AUF1 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and purified as described by Pende et al.(25.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R.

The concentration of purified recombinant His6-AUF1 was estimated by comparison with dilutions of BSA using Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A 1 × 19-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was equilibrated in factor-binding buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5.5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate). Four micromolar purified recombinant His6-AUF1 in a final volume of 300 μl of factor-binding buffer was loaded onto the column; 60 300-μl fractions were collected. Twenty microliters of each fraction was assayed for His6-AUF1 by Western blot analysis using anti-AUF1 antisera, and 5 μl of each fraction was analyzed for RNA-binding activity by mobility shift assay with radiolabeled c-fos ARE. Similarly, 400 nM purified recombinant His6-AUF1 in 300 μl of factor-binding buffer was loaded onto the column, and 20 900-μl fractions were collected. Protein in these fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 20 μg/ml lysozyme by incubation on ice for 30 min and centrifugation at 4°C for 30 min. Each precipitate was resuspended in 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and assayed for His6-AUF1 by Western blot. The void volume was determined using blue dextran. The sequences Rβ+AT×1, Rβ+AT×2, Rβ+AT×3, and Rβ+AT×5 were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using plasmids pNEORβGAT1×, pNEORβGAT2×, pNEORβGAT3×, and pNEORβGAT5× ((26.Akashi M. Shaw G.

For each reaction, the 5′ oligo primer was 5′-CTGTCTCATCATTTTGG-3′, and the 3′ oligo primer was 5′-CGCGGTACCGAAGAGGGACAGCTATG-3′. Amplified fragments were digested with KpnI and EcoRI and ligated to KpnI-EcoRI digested pT7/T3α19 (Life Technologies, Inc.) to create plasmids pα19Rβ+AT×1, pα19Rβ+AT×2, pα19Rβ+AT×3, and pα19Rβ+AT×5. Plasmid pα19Rβ+AT×4 was synthesized by first annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGATTTATTTATTTATTTAGCTTTAG-3′ and 5′-TCGACTAAAGCTAAATAAATAAATAAAT-3′ and then ligating to the 3.1-kilobase vector fragment derived from XbaI-SalI digested pα19Rβ+AT×5. The U32 sequence was created as a BamHI-BglII fragment by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCT32A-3′ and 5-GATCTA32G-3′. BglII-digested pα19Rβ was ligated to the annealed U32 sequence to create plasmid pα19Rβ+U32. The XbaI-SalI fragment of pα19Rβ+AT×5 (described above) containing (ATTT)5 was removed, and a BglII site was created using a synthetic linker, creating plasmid pα19RβΔAU.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) was linearized with SspI for synthesis of c-myc ARE. Radiolabeled RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription of each DNA template using either T3 or SP6 RNA Polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (ICN). Purified recombinant His6-AUF1 fusion protein was incubated with 1 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA probe in a final volume of 10 μl containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM spermine, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 8 units of RNasin, 0.2 μg/μl tRNA, 5 μg/μl heparin, and 0.1 μg/μl poly(C). Reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 10 min. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis through nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 60:1) in 45 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3), 1 mM EDTA. Gels were prerun for 30 min at 13 V/cm prior to sample loading. Gels were then run at 13 V/cm for 2-3 h, dried, and visualized on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In some experiments there was a loss of shifted products during electrophoresis. This was observed as smears migrating between the bound and free RNA bands. Thus, free RNA bands were routinely used for quantitation using ImageQuant image analysis software (Molecular Dynamics). Free probe concentration was plotted versus His6-AUF1 concentration, and apparent Kd values were determined as the protein concentration at which 50% of the RNA was bound(27.Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). For each RNA substrate tested, binding assays were performed in triplicate, and the average apparent Kd and standard deviation were determined. In addition, the Newman-Kuels analysis of variance test was applied to each set of apparent Kd values to identify significant differences (p < 0.05) between Kd values for binding to the various RNA substrates. Twenty-five nanograms of purified recombinant His6-AUF1 and 40 fmol of 32P-labeled RNA containing the c-fos ARE were incubated as described above for mobility shift reactions. The binding mixture was then treated with 2500 μJ of UV light for 3 min and digested with 10 μg of RNase A at 37°C for 30 min. The binding reaction was fractionated on an SDS, 10% polyacrylamide gel using prestained molecular weight standards as markers, fixed in the gel, and detected by autoradiography. We previously reported the purification, molecular cloning, and characterization of the ARE-binding protein AUF1. Our hypothesis is that the binding affinity of AUF1 for an ARE should reflect the potency of that ARE as a mRNA destabilizer. To address this hypothesis biochemically, we have examined the RNA-binding properties of AUF1. For this purpose we expressed a His6-AUF1 fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified the recombinant protein, which has an apparent molecular mass of about 51 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1, left panel). To confirm that this polypeptide was the ARE-binding protein, a binding reaction containing radiolabeled c-fos ARE was treated with UV light, digested with RNase A, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. The 51-kDa His6-AUF1 polypeptide was the major cross-linked species observed (Fig. 1, right panel). As a control, a lysate prepared from bacteria expressing the empty vector had no detectable ARE-binding activity by UV cross-linking assay (data not shown). Therefore, the RNA-binding protein in these studies is His6-AUF1. In addition, the gel filtration profile of His6-AUF1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM magnesium acetate, 100 mM potassium acetate was the same at both 400 nM and 4 μM protein (data not shown), suggesting that the protein does not form high molecular weight aggregates that could affect its ARE-binding activity. RNA-binding activity of His6-AUF1 was assayed by nondenaturing gel mobility shift assays using radiolabeled substrates containing either one AUUUA motif or from two to five tandem repeats of AUUU. (See Fig. 2 for RNA sequences.) AUUUA motifs are present in the AREs of most unstable proto-oncogene and cytokine mRNAs, and the potency of an AUUU-containing sequence to act as a mRNA destabilizer is proportional to the number of tandemly repeated AUUU motifs(16.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Radiolabeled RNA substrates were incubated with increasing concentrations of His6-AUF1, and the products were resolved by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Shown in Fig. 3 are representative gels along with plots of free RNA concentration versus fusion protein concentration. His6-AUF1 ARE binding affinities increase as the number of tandemly repeated AUUU motifs is increased (Table 1), with lowest affinity binding to Rβ+AUUUA (apparent Kd = 210 ± 50 nM) and highest affinity binding to Rβ+(AUUU)5 (apparent Kd = 19 ± 7 nM). The control RNA substrate RβΔAU, which has all AUUU repeats deleted, is bound by His6-AUF1 with low affinity (apparent Kd = 660 ± 90 nM (data not shown)).Figure 3:His6-AUF1 binding affinity for AUUU-containing sequences increases as the number of tandemly repeated AUUU motifs is increased. His6-AUF1 binding to RNA substrates containing AUUUA or tandem repeats of AUUU (see Fig. 2) was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and apparent Kd for His6-AUF1 binding to each RNA was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Representative binding reactions using His6-AUF1 and radiolabeled RNA substrates are shown at the top of each panel, and plots of [RNAfree] versus [His6-AUF1] are shown at the bottom of each panel.

For each RNA substrate, the Kd value shown is the average of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1 Since multiple tandem repeats of AUUU constitute primarily U-rich sequence, the increasing binding affinity by His6-AUF1 observed with increasing AUUU copy number could result from an increase in the number of uridylate residues. To test His6-AUF1 binding affinity for U-rich RNA, binding to a substrate containing U32 was performed, since this sequence has been tested for mRNA destabilizing activity(17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd for His6-AUF1 binding to the Rβ+U32 substrate is >500 nM (Fig. 4). While low affinity binding occurs to the Rβ+U32 substrate, no binding is detected to the control β-globin substrate lacking the U32 sequence (Fig. 4). Nonetheless the estimated binding affinity to Rβ+U32 (>500 nM) is at least 20-fold lower than that for binding to Rβ+(AUUU)5 (Kd = 19 ± 7 nM). Likewise, heterologous mRNAs containing poly(U) tracts in their 3′-UTRs are stable(16.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28.Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We conclude that His6-AUF1 binding affinities for the AUUU-containing RNAs parallel their potencies as mRNA destabilizers. The low affinity binding to the U32 substrate is also consistent with its inability to promote mRNA degradation. Our results show that His6-AUF1 has a relatively low affinity for a substrate with two tandem AUUU motifs (Table 1). The c-fos ARE has two tandem AUUU motifs and a single AUUUA motif separated by 19 nucleotides, while the c-myc ARE has two AUUUA motifs separated by 25 nucleotides (see Fig. 2). However, the c-fos and c-myc AREs are very potent mRNA destabilizers(17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28.Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). We therefore examined binding of His6-AUF1 to RNA substrates containing these AREs using the mobility shift assay. A plot of free RNA concentration versus fusion protein concentration revealed an apparent Kd of 7.8 ± 0.4 nM for the c-fos ARE (Rβ+fosARE; Fig. 5A). High affinity binding does not require intact AUUUA motifs, since His6-AUF1 binds the ARE3 mutant c-fos substrate containing single U-to-A substitutions in each AUUUA motif with an apparent Kd of 20 ± 4 nM (Rβ+ARE3; Fig. 5B). (The difference in binding affinity between the wild-type and mutant c-fos ARE is not statistically significant (p > 0.05).) Likewise, His6-AUF1 binds the c-myc ARE with an affinity (Kd = 21 ± 3 nM) similar to that for the c-fos ARE (Table 1). (The difference in binding affinity between the c-myc and c-fos ARE is not statistically significant (p > 0.05).) We conclude that AUF1 binds authentic c-fos and c-myc AREs with high affinity even though these AREs lack multiple tandem repeats of AUUU. Thus, AUF1 is capable of binding a number of different AREs with high affinity. The importance of AREs for mRNA turnover was first realized in 1986(12.Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar, 14.Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar), yet it is still unclear how AREs function in mRNA decay. We have utilized biochemical approaches to identify trans-acting factors that bind AREs in order to relate such RNA binding to mRNA degradation. We previously purified, characterized, and molecularly cloned the ARE-binding protein AUF1, and in the present study we have examined binding affinities of a His6-AUF1 fusion protein for A+U-rich sequences with defined relative potencies as mRNA destabilizers. Here, by determining apparent Kd values for His6-AUF1 binding, we demonstrate that AUF1-ARE binding affinity is directly related to the potency with which an ARE destabilizes a heterologous mRNA (Table 1). Additionally, the affinity of His6-AUF1 for the most potent destabilizing AREs is within the average range (10−9 M) of affinities exhibited by several other RNA-binding proteins that recognize specific sequences or structures(29.McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Certain A+U-rich sequences are more potent mRNA destabilizers than others, suggesting that the potencies of destabilizers are proportional to the binding affinities of a cellular decay factor(s). For example, when placed in the context of a heterologous, normally stable mRNA, AUUUA and (AUUU)2 are relatively ineffective as destabilizing elements; (AUUU)3 has a modest destabilizing effect; (AUUU)4 increases the decay rate further; and (AUUU)5 is the most potent destabilizer of the five(16.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 26.Akashi M. Shaw G. Hachiya M. Elstner E. Suzuki G. Koeffler P. Blood. 1994; 83: 3182-3187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, (AUUU)5 increases the degradation rate of a reporter mRNA to about the same extent as does the c-fos ARE(17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Likewise, His6-AUF1 binds the c-fos ARE (Kd = 7.8 ± 0.4 nM) and the (AUUU)5 substrate (Kd = 19 ± 7 nM) with similar affinities. (The differences are not statistically significant (p > 0.05).) Statistical analyses were used to determine significant differences (i.e. p < 0.05) between Kd values for His6-AUF1 binding to various RNA substrates, and as a result the RNA sequences used in this study can be grouped into three general classes: (i) RNAs that are either not bound or bound with low affinity by AUF1 and are not mRNA destabilizers (β-globin, U32, and AUUUA); (ii) RNAs that are bound with gradually increasing, moderate affinities by AUF1 and have a gradually increasing, partial destabilizing effect ((AUUU)2 < (AUUU)3 < (AUUU)4); and (iii) RNAs that are bound with the highest affinity by AUF1 and are potent mRNA destabilizers (c-fos and c-myc AREs and (AUUU)5). Based upon these ranges of AUF1 binding affinities for various RNA substrates (low, moderate, high) and the relationship of high affinity binding to mRNA decay, the affinity of AUF1 for a mRNA may dictate the rate at which it is degraded. Therefore, cellular AUF1 concentration may be one determinant of mRNA half-life. In this regard we found that by comparing Western blots of K562 cytoplasmic extracts with known amounts of purified recombinant p37AUF1 (the isoform used in these studies) that there are approximately 3.2 × 104 cytoplasmic molecules of p37AUF1/cell (data not shown). Assuming a diameter of 20 μm for K562 cells and 50% of the cell volume as cytoplasm(30.Koeffler H.P. Golde D.W. Blood. 1980; 56: 344-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the concentration of p37AUF1 is approximately 25 nM. This value is comparable with the apparent Kd for binding to the c-myc ARE. Thus low cellular concentrations of active AUF1 may be sufficient for binding to a mRNA that contains a high affinity AUF1-binding site such as the c-myc and c-fos AREs. Based upon our results, such mRNAs should have very short half-lives. Likewise, mRNAs with AREs bound with lower affinities by AUF1 might require a higher concentration of active AUF1 for binding; these mRNAs should be degraded at a slower rate than those with high affinity binding sites. Thus, the availability of active AUF1 for ARE binding is a potential mechanism by which cells could control mRNA turnover rates and one in which the decay of multiple mRNAs could be differentially regulated by AUF1 concentration. Support for this hypothesis is the relationship between AUF1 levels and ARE-directed mRNA destabilization observed in DDT1-MF2 hamster smooth muscle cells treated with(-)isoproterenol. In this case,(-)isoproterenol induces an increase in cellular AUF1 protein and mRNA levels. This increase in turn correlates with a faster decay rate for β2-adrenergic receptor mRNA, which contains an AUF1 binding site(s) in the 3′-UTR(25.Pende A. Tremmel K.D. DeMaria C.T. Blaxall B.C. Minobe W.A. Sherman J.S. Bisognano J.D. Bristow M.R. Brewer G. Port J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8493-8501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups reported that the functional sequence within an ARE appears to be the nonamer sequence UUAUUUAUU(16.Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 17.Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). One copy of the sequence UUAUUUAUU in the 3′-UTR of a normally stable mRNA can increase its degradation rate compared with the wild-type mRNA, while two copies of the nonamer motif act as a very potent mRNA destabilizer. As depicted in Fig. 2, (AUUU)3 contains one copy of the nonamer (underlined in Fig. 2); (AUUU)4 contains two overlapping copies; and (AUUU)5 contains two copies that overlap by a single nucleotide. Consistent with the potencies of two copies or one copy of the nonamer as destabilizers, binding affinity of His6-AUF1 for (AUUU)5 is 3-fold and 5-fold greater than the binding affinities for (AUUU)4 or (AUUU)3, respectively (Table 1). Thus, AUF1 may function in part via recognition of the nonamer motif. Despite the potential importance of the nonamer motif UUAUUUAUU in ARE-directed mRNA decay, it is important to note that not all AREs found in unstable mRNAs contain this motif. For example, the portion of the c-myc ARE that functions as a very potent mRNA destabilizer does not contain this motif(28.Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). While the c-myc ARE does contain noncontiguous AUUUA motifs, destabilizing AREs that contain no AUUUA motifs have also been identified. In addition, the presence of one or more AUUUA motifs in an ARE may not be sufficient for effective mRNA destabilization(28.Chen C.-Y. A. Shyu A.-B. S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8471-8482Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Moreover, analysis of a c-fos ARE mutant, ARE3, with single U-to-A substitutions in all three AUUUA motifs showed that intact AUUUA motifs are not required for rapid mRNA deadenylation but are important for rapid degradation of the mRNA body(9.Shyu A.-B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd for His6-AUF1 binding to the c-fos ARE and the ARE3 mutant were not statistically different (7.8 ± 0.4 nM and 20 ± 4 nM, respectively; p > 0.05). Likewise, His6-AUF1 bound a mutant c-myc ARE with single U-to-A mutations in both AUUUA motifs with affinity similar to wild-type c-myc ARE (data not shown). Thus, intact AUUUA motifs are not required for high affinity binding of His6-AUF1 to the c-fos and c-myc AREs. Therefore, although the study of AUUUA and UUAUUUAUU motifs has contributed greatly to understanding of ARE-directed mRNA decay, it is evident that these motifs may constitute only a subset of important motifs within various AREs. In conclusion, our results suggest that the affinity of AUF1 for particular ARE sequences is related to their potency as mRNA destabilizers. Future experiments will utilize AUF1 as a tool to define multiple classes of AREs and to define specific nucleotide requirements for AUF1 binding by selection of high affinity binding substrates from combinatorial libraries of RNA sequences (e.g., SELEX; reviewed in (31.Kenan D.J. Tsai D.E. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 57-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)).

CETP facilitates the transfer of cholesteryl esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids between lipoproteins(7.Albers J.J. Tollefson J.H. Chen C.-H. Steinmetz A.

Lipid. Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLTP also mediates high density lipoprotein (HDL) conversion, the transformation of HDL into smaller and larger particles(8.Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F.T. Lok S. Tu A.-Y.

Through these activities, PLTP may regulate HDL level and composition and thereby affect cholesterol metabolism(6.Tollefson J.H. Ravnik S. Albers J.J. J. Lipid. Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because our previous studies indicated that the transfer of LPS may be important in modulating inflammatory responses to LPS, and because LBP and PLTP share sequence similarity as well as related functions, we investigated the ability of PLTP to interact with LPS and transfer LPS to R-HDL or to CD14. LPS from Salmonella minnesota strains R60 and R595 and [3H]LPS from Escherichia coli K12/LCD25 were purchased from List Biological Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Endotoxin-free human serum albumin was purchased from Armour Pharmaceutical Co. (Kankakee, IL). Recombinant human LBP (rLBP) and recombinant human sCD14, expressed and purified as described(4.Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), were generous gifts of Dr. Henri Lichenstein (AMGEN, Thousand Oaks, CA). Purified apolipoprotein A-I was a generous gift of Dr. Jan Eva Doran (Swiss Red Cross, Bern, Switzerland). Human recombinant PLTP was prepared as described(8.Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F.T. Lok S. Tu A.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Human PLTP cDNA was cloned from a cDNA library constructed from human umbilical vein endothelial cells by ligation of the cDNA to mammalian expression vector pZem228cc(5.Day J.R. Albers J.J. Lofton-Day C.E. Gilbert T.L. Ching A.F.T. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. Marcovina S.M. Adolphson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9388-9391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones containing the complete PLTP cDNA were transfected into baby hamster kidney (BHK-570) cells using calcium phosphate-mediated transfection(11.Waechter D.E. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1106-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The selectable marker Neo(G418) was used to select for stable colonies by plating the initial transfection at low concentrations of cells and the use of cloning cylinders. For some studies, six histidines were added to the carboxyl terminus (rPLTP-His) for the purpose of simplifying the purification of rPLTP. The addition of the His tag permitted a rapid one-step affinity purification of PLTP from conditioned media using nickel affinity chromatography (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The cDNA, encoding rPLTP-His obtained by polymerase chain reaction, was subcloned into pHZ-200, a mammalian expression vector incorporating dihydrofolate reductase as the selectable marker. This plasmid was verified to have a DNA sequence identical with that of PLTP cDNA. It was previously reported that rPLTP-His had only 10% of the phospholipid transfer activity of conditioned medium containing rPLTP without the His residues(8.Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F.T. Lok S. Tu A.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the plasmid for these earlier studies was shown to contain 4 separate nucleotide substitutions giving rise to an rPLTP with an altered sequence. The rPLTP-His in the present studies had the same phospholipid transfer specific activity as purified plasma-derived PLTP. PLTP was purified to homogeneity from human plasma using dextran sulfate/CaCl2 precipitation and a combination of phenyl-Sepharose, CM-cellulose, DEAE-cellulose, heparin-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite chromatography as described(10.Tu A.-Y. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23098-23105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody was raised in a goat by injecting approximately 300 μg of rPLTP with an equal volume of Freund's adjuvant. The goat was immunized once after 3 weeks with the same dose of rPLTP and bled at 3-4-week intervals. Anti-rPLTP IgG was prepared following the procedure of McKinney and Parkinson(12.McKinney M.M. Parkinson A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). A control goat IgG (goat anti-rabbit IgG) was from Incstar (Stillwater, MN). R-HDL was prepared by the sodium cholate dialysis method as described previously (13.Matz C.E. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4535-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), was mixed with egg phosphatidylcholine and cholate at a molar ratio of 80:1:80 (phosphatidylcholine:apoA-I:cholate), and cholate was removed with extensive dialysis against PD-EDTA (Dulbecco's PBS lacking Ca2+ and Mg2+ with 1 mM EDTA) containing 0.01% sodium azide. For gel electrophoresis, a homogeneous population of particles was further purified by gel filtration over two Superose 6 columns (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in series. Final preparations were stored in PD-EDTA with 0.01% azide at 4°C. All concentration values for R-HDL particles are expressed as the equivalent concentration of apoA-I in μg/ml. To assess the biologic activity of LPS, we measured adhesion of human neutrophils to fibrinogen-coated surfaces as described(2.Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 4.Hailman E. Lichenstein H.S. Wurfel M.M. Miller D.S. Johnson D.A. Kelley M. Busse L.A. Zukowski M.M. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In this assay, stimulation of neutrophil adhesion by LPS is dependent on the presence of LBP or plasma. Briefly, mixtures containing LPS were diluted in APBS (Dulbecco's PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 0.5% human serum albumin) to the concentrations indicated, yielding a final volume of 50 μl. 10 μl of freshly isolated neutrophils (2 × 107 cells/ml in HAP (Dulbecco's PBS with 0.5 unit/ml aprotinin, 0.05% human serum albumin, 3 mMD-glucose)) fluorescently labeled with 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester as described (14.van Kessel K.P.M. Park C.T. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were added and incubated for 10 min at 37°C to stimulate the cells. Neutrophils were then washed into HAP and added to a 72-well Terasaki plate precoated with fibrinogen. After 15 min at 37°C, adhesion of neutrophils to the plate was quantitated. The fluorescence in each well was measured using a Cytofluor 2300 (Millipore Corp.) as a way of quantitating the total number of cells per well. The plate was then washed and fluorescence was measured again. Binding is expressed as the percentage of cells remaining in the well after the washing step (adhesion (%)). Donor to donor variation in maximal responses prohibited averaging results of separate experiments, but the pattern of responses was highly reproducible. Neutralization of LPS was measured as the loss of its ability to stimulate adhesion of neutrophils to fibrinogen, as described previously(2.Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS was incubated alone or with PLTP in 50 μl of APBS. After incubation for the indicated intervals at 37°C, the amount of biologically active LPS remaining in the tube was assessed by adding neutrophils resuspended in 50% human plasma and measuring adhesion as described above. Heparinized blood was obtained by venipuncture from healthy human volunteers. Samples were incubated for 5 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 environment, then centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 × g. Plasma was collected and stored at −20°C until assayed for IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL-6 levels were measured using a commercially available human IL-6 ELISA kit (Central Laboratories of the Netherlands Red Cross Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), modified for use with smaller volumes of reagents and for detection of IL-6 with a fluorescent alkaline phosphatase substrate as described(15.Kusunoki T. Hailman E. Juan T.S.-C. Lichenstein H.S. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1673-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). [3H]LPS was sonicated for 1 min and incubated at 37°C for various times with R-HDL and other proteins as indicated in the figure legends. Just before electrophoresis, 1/2 volume of a loading buffer containing 0.005% bromphenol blue and 20% glycerol in PBS was added to each sample. The samples were run in continuous buffer (pH 8.6), nondenaturing Tris-glycine 8-16% polyacrylamide step-gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) at 100-150 V for 2-3 h in a running buffer containing 192 mM glycine, 24 mM Tris, pH 8.3. After electrophoresis, the gels were soaked in EN3HANCE(TM) (DuPont NEN) for 45 min, washed three times for 15 min in ddH2O, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film for 5-22 days. LPS from S. minnesota R595 was labeled with the fluorophore BODIPY FL C3 as described(16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), using a kit from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). LPS self-associates in aqueous solution, forming high molecular weight complexes (17.Ribi E. Anacker R.L. Brown R. Haskins W.T. Malmgren B. Milner K.C. Rudbach J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1966; 92: 1493-1509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) which we call micelles, although other physical structures have been suggested by physical data(18.Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Zähringer U. Schade U.F. Brade L. Loppnow H. Feist W. Wang M.-H. Ulmer A.J. Flad H.-D. Brandenburg K. Kirikae T. Grimmecke D. Holst O. Brade H. Inf. Dis. Clin. N. America. 1991; 5: 753-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high local concentration of BODIPY in BODIPY-LPS micelles results in self-quenching of the fluorophore(16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The addition of detergent to BODIPY-LPS, or the binding of BODIPY-LPS to a protein such as CD14 physically separates the BODIPY molecules, resulting in a rise in fluorescence(16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a process referred to as dequenching. Thus, fluorescently labeled LPS can be used to study binding and transfer of LPS in real time(16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19.Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS was measured as described (16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with an SLM-SPF500c spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Time-dependent changes in fluorescence were measured by diluting BODIPY-LPS and other reagents in PD-EDTA or in PBS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and quickly mixing in a submicrocuvette (Starna Cells Inc., Atascadero, CA). Fluorescence emission at 518 nm was digitally recorded over time, with excitation at 485 nm. To investigate whether PLTP could modulate the biologic activity of LPS, we measured the effect of PLTP on the LPS-induced adhesion of neutrophils to fibrinogen-coated surfaces. Incubation of LPS with conditioned medium from cells transfected with the cDNA for human PLTP (rPLTP medium) resulted in the rapid neutralization of the activity of LPS (Fig. 1A). Neutralization was not seen upon incubation of LPS alone or with medium from untransfected cells (control medium) (Fig. 1A). Control medium failed to neutralize LPS when added at up to 20 times the concentration of rPLTP medium needed to neutralize LPS (not shown). To confirm that the neutralizing activity in rPLTP medium was due to rPLTP, we examined the ability of anti-rPLTP IgG to inhibit neutralization of LPS by rPLTP medium. Anti-PLTP IgG caused a dose-dependent inhibition of neutralization of LPS by rPLTP medium, whereas a control IgG had no effect (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that PLTP neutralizes LPS and to determine the amount of PLTP needed for neutralization, we measured the effect of purified recombinant PLTP (rPLTP-His) on LPS-induced responses. In a 30-min incubation of rPLTP-His with LPS, complete neutralization of 10 ng/ml LPS was seen with 3 μg/ml rPLTP-His (Fig. 2), and 1 μg/ml rPLTP-His neutralized >90% of the activity of LPS (determined by comparing Fig. 2 with a dose-response curve for LPS from the same experiment; not shown). PLTP purified from human plasma also neutralized LPS, with a time course and dose dependence similar to that seen with purified rPLTP-His (not shown). The neutralization of LPS upon incubation with PLTP suggested a physical interaction of PLTP with LPS. To detect such an interaction, we measured the effect of rPLTP-His on the fluorescence of LPS labeled with the fluorophore BODIPY (BODIPY-LPS). In previous studies, incubating LBP with fluorescently labeled LPS resulted in fluorescence dequenching (an increase in fluorescence)(16.Yu B. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4100-4105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19.Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Consistent with these published results, we found that the incubation of equimolar rLBP with BODIPY-LPS caused an increase in fluorescence, reaching three times the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS alone in 200 s (Fig. 3A, curves 1 and 4). The same concentration of rPLTP-His also caused dequenching of BODIPY-LPS, to at least twice background levels (Fig. 3A, curve 3). With rLBP, there was a rapid phase of dequenching of BODIPY-LPS for the first ∼20 s which was not seen with rPLTP-His, but, after this time, the two proteins had similar effects on fluorescence. Dequenching of BODIPY-LPS was not a general property of proteins, since human serum albumin caused only a slight increase in the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 3A, curve 2). Because rPLTP-His was added in a low-pH buffer, we incubated BODIPY-LPS with the same amount of this buffer as was added with rPLTP-His, as a control. The rise of fluorescence caused by rPLTP-His was not seen with low-pH buffer alone (not shown), demonstrating that this effect of rPLTP-His was not due to changes in pH. The change in fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS caused by rPLTP-His strongly suggests that there is a physical interaction of PLTP with LPS. LBP is known to bind LPS(19.Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Gegner J.A. Mintz D. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10482-10488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 20.Tobias P. Soldau K. Ulevitch R. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 21.Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and LBP and PLTP have similar abilities to cause dequenching of BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 3A). Additionally, several proteins have been identified which neutralize LPS by binding it (see “Discussion”), and PLTP shares this ability to neutralize LPS (Figure 1:, Figure 2:). Taken together, these results suggest that PLTP binds LPS, and neutralization of LPS occurs as a result of this binding. The effect of rPLTP-His or rLBP on the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS was less pronounced in the presence of divalent cations and in the absence of EDTA (Fig. 3B) than in EDTA-containing buffer (Fig. 3A). In divalent cation-containing buffer (PBS), rPLTP-His and rLBP consistently caused a rise in fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS, although only to ∼1.5 times the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS alone (Fig. 3B). This effect of EDTA is consistent with its ability to destabilize interactions between LPS molecules (see “Discussion”). The experiment shown in Fig. 3A was performed with EDTA to emphasize the effects of rPLTP-His and rLBP on BODIPY-LPS. Subsequent experiments, using BODIPY-LPS to assess the transfer activities of PLTP and LBP, were performed in PBS, taking advantage of the limited effect of PLTP or LBP alone on the fluorescence of BODIPY-LPS under these conditions. Because PLTP appears to bind LPS and acts as a transfer protein for phospholipids(6.Tollefson J.H. Ravnik S. Albers J.J. J. Lipid. Res. 1988; 29: 1593-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that PLTP may have the ability to transfer LPS. We assessed transfer activity using BODIPY-LPS donor micelles and unlabeled LPS acceptor micelles. Transfer of BODIPY-LPS to acceptor micelles should result in dequenching due to dilution of BODIPY-LPS monomers in micelles of unlabeled LPS. Incubation of BODIPY-LPS micelles alone, with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled LPS micelles, with rPLTP-His or with rLBP caused little change in fluorescence (Fig. 4, curves 1-4). However, rapid dequenching was seen when BODIPY-LPS was incubated with unlabeled LPS micelles and rPLTP-His together (Fig. 4, curves 5 and 6) or unlabeled LPS micelles and rLBP together (Fig. 4, curves 7 and 8), suggesting that both rLBP and rPLTP-His can transfer BODIPY-LPS between micelles of LPS. rPLTP-His appeared to be somewhat less efficient than rLBP in mediating this transfer event, as there was more rapid dequenching with LBP than with rPLTP-His at the two concentrations tested. We have shown recently that rLBP transfers LPS to R-HDL particles: rLBP facilitates transfer of [3H]LPS aggregates to R-HDL particles separated with nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (native PAGE)(22.Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and rLBP enables R-HDL to functionally neutralize LPS(2.Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 22.Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Since PLTP neutralizes LPS without added R-HDL, we could not use functional assays to determine if PLTP transfers LPS to R-HDL. Instead, we examined transfer of [3H]LPS to R-HDL using native PAGE. [3H]LPS incubated alone, with rLBP, with rPLTP-His, or with R-HDL did not comigrate with the main band of R-HDL seen with Coomassie staining (Fig. 5, lanes 1-5), indicating that [3H]LPS does not spontaneously bind to R-HDL under these conditions, as we have shown previously(22.Wurfel M.M. Hailman E. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, upon incubation of [3H]LPS with rLBP and R-HDL together, a portion of the [3H]LPS migrated at the position of the main Coomassie-stained band of R-HDL incubated with rLBP (Fig. 5, lanes 6-9). Similarly, incubation of [3H]LPS with rPLTP-His and R-HDL together yielded a radioactive band at the position of the main Coomassie-stained band of R-HDL incubated with rPLTP-His (Fig. 5, lanes 10-13). The dramatic change in mobility of R-HDL caused by rPLTP-His (compare lanes 5 and 13 of Fig. 5) was time-dependent (not shown) and may reflect the ability of rPLTP-His to mediate HDL conversion, a modification of HDL resulting in populations of larger and smaller particles(8.Albers J.J. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Day J.R. Ching A.F.T. Lok S. Tu A.-Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1258: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9.Jauhiainen M. Metso J. Pahlman R. Blomqvist S. van Tol A. Ehnholm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4032-4036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Tu A.-Y. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23098-23105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Very similar electrophoresis patterns were seen upon incubation of [3H]LPS and R-HDL with rPLTP-His, with plasma-derived PLTP, or with rPLTP medium, but not with control medium (not shown). These results suggest that PLTP can transfer [3H]LPS to R-HDL. We used BODIPY-LPS donor micelles and R-HDL as acceptor particles to confirm the ability of rPLTP-His to mediate transfer of LPS to R-HDL. Incubation of BODIPY-LPS with rLBP, rPLTP-His, or R-HDL resulted in a modest increase in fluorescence (Fig. 6, curves 1-4), whereas incubation with rLBP and R-HDL or rPLTP-His and R-HDL resulted in more rapid dequenching of BODIPY-LPS (Fig. 6, curves 5 and 6), a result consistent with transfer of BODIPY-LPS to R-HDL particles. Dequenching of BODIPY-LPS might also result from transfer of phospholipid molecules from R-HDL particles to BODIPY-LPS micelles. If this were the case, however, one would expect fluorescence to rise only after a time lag: BODIPY-LPS molecules in a micelle would only become dequenched after transfer of many phospholipid molecules into the aggregate. If dequenching were due to transfer of BODIPY-LPS molecules to R-HDL particles, however, fluorescence dequenching would not have a time lag, since the first BODIPY-LPS molecules transferred to an HDL particle would be dequenched. Since rPLTP-His caused an increase in BODIPY fluorescence without a time lag (Fig. 6, curve 6), we believe that the rapid dequenching observed represents the transfer of BODIPY-LPS to R-HDL. CD14 is a 55-kDa glycoprotein found as a membrane-bound, glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein on the surfaces of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils (mCD14) and as a soluble protein in blood (sCD14). Both of these forms of CD14 can bind LPS and mediate responses of cells to LPS(23.Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2057977031,"In the crystal structure of a substrate complex, the side chains of residues Asn279, Tyr271, and Arg283 of DNA polymerase beta are within hydrogen bonding distance to the bases of the incoming deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP), the terminal primer nucleotide, and the templating nucleotide, respectively (Pelletier, H., Sawaya, M. R., Kumar, A., Wilson, S. H., and Kraut, J. (1994) Science 264, 1891-1903). We have altered these side chains through individual site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and was soluble. The mutant enzymes were purified and characterized to probe their role in nucleotide discrimination and catalysis. A reversion assay was developed on a short (5 nucleotide) gapped DNA substrate containing an opal codon to assess the effect of the amino acid substitutions on fidelity. Substitution of the tyrosine at position 271 with phenylalanine or histidine did not influence catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) or fidelity. The hydrogen bonding potential between the side chain of Asn279 and the incoming nucleotide was removed by replacing this residue with alanine or leucine. Although catalytic efficiency was reduced as much as 17-fold for these mutants, fidelity was not. In contrast, both catalytic efficiency and fidelity decreased dramatically for all mutants of Arg283 (Ala > Leu > Lys). The fidelity and catalytic efficiency of the alanine mutant of Arg283 decreased 160- and 5000-fold, respectively, relative to wild-type enzyme. Sequence analyses of the mutant DNA resulting from short gap-filling synthesis indicated that the types of base substitution errors produced by the wild-type and R283A mutant were similar and indicated misincorporations resulting in frequent T.dGTP and A.dGTP mispairing. With R283A, a dGMP was incorporated opposite a template thymidine as often as the correct nucleotide. The x-ray crystallographic structure of the alanine mutant of Arg283 verified the loss of the mutated side chain. Our results indicate that specific interactions between DNA polymerase beta and the template base, but not hydrogen bonding to the incoming dNTP or terminal primer nucleotide, are required for both high catalytic efficiency and nucleotide discrimination."

Seven α1(I)-derived triple-helical peptides (THPs) were synthesized based on charge clustering (α1(I)256-270, α1(I)385-396, α1(I)406-417, α1(I)415-423, α1(I)448-456, α1(I)496-507, and α1(I)526-537).

Of the ten THPs, α1(I)772-786 THP had the greatest activity, with half-maximal normal dermal fibroblast adhesion occurring at a peptide concentration of 1.6 μM. Triple-helicity was essential for activity of this sequence, as the non-triple-helical peptide analog (α1(I)772-786 SSP) exhibited considerably lower levels of cell adhesion promotion even at peptide concentrations as high as 100 μM. Within the sequence itself, residues 784-786 (Gly-Leu-Hyp) were important for cellular recognition, as the α1(I)772-783 THP had greatly reduced cell adhesion activity compared with α1(I)772-786 THP.

This nuclear process requires double-stranded RNA structures formed by exonic and intronic sequences in the pre-mRNA and is likely to be catalyzed by an adenosine deaminase that recognizes these structures as a substrate. DRADA, a double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase, is a candidate enzyme for L-glutamate-activated receptor channel (GluR) pre-mRNA editing. We show here that DRADA indeed edits GluR pre-mRNAs, but that it displays selectivity for certain editing sites. Recombinantly expressed DRADA, both in its full-length form and in an N-terminally truncated version, edited the Q/R site in GluR6 pre-mRNA and the R/G site but not the Q/R site of GluR-B pre-mRNA. This substrate selectivity correlated with the base pairing status and sequence environment of the editing-targeted adenosines. The Q/R site of GluR-B pre-mRNA was edited by an activity partially purified from HeLa cells and thus differently structured editing sites in GluR pre-mRNAs appear to be substrates for different enzymatic activities.

https://openalex.org/W1521933398,"Acute stress evokes immediate responses in the cardiovascular endocrine, and immune systems. In particular, the number and activity of natural killer (NK) lymphocytes increase after stress. Here, we investigate the possibility to pharmacologically interfere with these stress-induced immunologic changes. Twenty-five healthy males were subjected to an acute stressor, a first-time tandem parachute jump. Subjects were randomly assigned to a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (propranolol), a benzodiazepine (alprazolam), or placebo group. To analyze the role of the spleen in lymphocyte redistribution, splenectomized subjects performed a parachute jump. Propranolol, but no alprazolam, inhibited the heart rate increase during jumping. Increases in epinephrine and cortisol in the propranolol group were comparable to placebo, but were attenuated by alprazolam. The number and activity of NK cells significantly increased in the placebo group but not in the propranolol group immediately after stress. Alprazolam treatment did not alter the increase in NK cell numbers but did inhibit the increase in NK activity. In splenectomized subjects, NK cell numbers, but not NK activity, increased as in placebo subjects. We conclude that stress-induced changes in the immune system are controlled by beta-adrenergic mechanisms and only partly depend on the spleen; central interference with alprazolam differentially affects stress-induced changes in the NK cell compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1933795947,"Inflammation following an infection induces a range of nonspecific symptoms of sickness in animals and humans. The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediates many of the brain-mediated symptoms of sickness. Binding sites for IL-1 have been found in mouse brain, but not in the brains of rats. This raises questions as to the involvement of these neuronally localized IL-1 binding sites in the induction of sickness symptoms. Based on observations of IL-1 receptor mRNA in close vicinity to the vasculature in the mouse and rat brain, we studied the possibility that endothelial cells in the rat brain exhibit IL-1 receptors to transduce information to the brain. Ligand binding studies reveal that cultured endothelial cells of adult rat brain exhibit specific binding sites for rat IL-1beta. Polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that mRNA of the type I but not that of the type II IL-1 receptor is present in rat brain endothelial cells. Incubation of these endothelial cells with recombinant rat IL-1beta showed a dose-dependent increase in interleukin-6, prostaglandin E(2), and prostacyclin secretion. Intravenous administration of rat IL-1beta to adult rats enhanced prostaglandin E(2) immunoreactivity in endothelial cells of the brain microvasculature. These results indicate that functional type I IL-1 receptors are present on endothelial cells of adult rat brain. We postulate that circulating IL-1 can be translated by brain endothelial cells into other signals such as interleukin-6 or prostaglandins that have access to the brain and induce sickness symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1593849782,"The transduction mechanism (or mechanisms) responsible for converting a mechanical load into a skeletal muscle growth response are unclear. In this study we have used a mechanically active tissue culture model of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells to investigate the relationship between mechanical load, sarcolemma wounding, fibroblast growth factor release, and skeletal muscle cell growth. Using the Flexcell Strain Unit we demonstrate that as mechanical load increases, so too does the amount of sarcolemma wounding. A similar relationship was also observed between the level of mechanical load inflicted on the cells and the amount of bFGF (FGF2) released into the surrounding medium. In addition, we demonstrate that the muscle cell growth response induced by chronic mechanical loading in culture can be inhibited by the presence of an antibody capable of neutralizing the biological activity of FGF. This study provides direct evidence that mechanically induced, sarcolemma wound-mediated FGF release is an important autocrine mechanism for transducing the stimulus of mechanical load into a skeletal muscle growth response."
https://openalex.org/W1985883480,Transcription factors IIB (TFIIB) and IIE (TFIIE) bound to RNA polymerase II have been revealed by electron crystallography in projection at 15.7 Å resolution. The results lead to simple hypotheses for the roles of these factors in the initiation of transcription. TFIIB is suggested to define the distance from TATA box to transcription start site by bringing TATA DNA in contact with polymerase at that distance from the active center of the enzyme. TFIIE is suggested to participate in a key conformational switch occurring at the active center upon polymerase–DNA interaction.

INTRODUCTIONAlthough evidence of a critical role for gap junctional intercellular communication in tissue development and morphogenesis is emerging(1.Wolburg H. Rohlmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 157: 315-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2.Yancey S.B. Biswal S. Revel J.P. Development. 1992; 114: 203-212PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Moreno A.P.

Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 219-222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the role of cell-to-cell coupling in fully developed tissue is less clear. Recent investigations, however, suggest that gap junctional coupling contributes to the coordinated responses of cellular networks to extracellular signals. For instance, pharmacological inhibitors of intercellular coupling have been shown to inhibit adrenocorticotropic hormone-induced steroidogenesis in adrenal cells(5.Munari-Silem Y. Lebrethon M.C. Morand I. Rousset B. Saez J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), bombesin-stimulated cytosolic calcium oscillations in pancreatic acini(6.Stauffer P.L.

Roy C. Spray D.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 266: 1054-1065PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies are difficult to interpret because the agents used to inhibit gap junctional coupling, in most cases lipophilic long chain alcohols, may have many nonspecific effects on cells(9.Bastiaanse E.M. Jongsma H.J. van der Laarse A. Takens-Kwak B.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 136: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). More precise approaches, which directly and specifically inhibit intercellular coupling in a particular cell type, are required to better understand gap junctional influences on cellular responses to extracellular signals.To more directly and specifically assess the role of intercellular communication on the ability of cell ensembles to respond to extracellular signals, we developed two clonal osteoblastic cell lines with markedly reduced dye coupling and expression of connexin43 (Cx43). 1The abbreviations used are: Cx43connexin43PTHparathyroid hormoneROSrat osteosarcoma 17/2.8 cellsdbcAMPdibutyryl cAMPrPTH(1-34)rat PTH fragment 1-34PTHrPPTH-related proteinPTHrP(1-36)human recombinant PTH-related protein fragment 1-36GAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasekbkilobase(s)PB0.1 M phosphate buffer. There are several reasons why osteoblastic cells present a useful paradigm to examine the role of intercellular communication in cellular responses to extracellular signals. Osteoblasts communicate with one another via gap junctions both in organ culture (10.Jeansonne B.G. Feagin F.F. McMinn R.W. Shoemaker R.L. Rehm W. J. Dent.

Dye coupling was quantified as described in Donahue et al.(16.Donahue H.J. McLeod K.J. Rubin C.T. Anderson J.A. Grine E.A. Hertzberg E.L. Brink P.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For some experiments a vehicle control (ethanol) or dbcAMP at a final concentration of 10 μM was added prior to initial dye loading.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted by previously published methods (31.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62975) Google Scholar) from cells on 100-mm dishes. Total RNA (20 μg) was denatured, separated, and transferred to a nylon solid support. Blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes of an 1.8-kb BamHI-NotI fragment of the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor cDNA(32.Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E.

Piechaczyk M. El Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Hybridizations and washes were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Schleicher & Schuell), followed by exposures for various time periods to Kodak X-Omat AR film with a Cronex intensifying screen. The abundance of specific mRNAs was quantified using a Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer. The data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA abundance.Detection of Cx43 ProteinTransfected and nontransfected cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and collected by scraping in ice cold buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μM leupeptin, and 0.1 μM pepstatin, pH 8.0. Cells were sonicated, and the particulate fraction was collected by centrifugation at 100,00 × g for 1 h at 4°C. Prior to electrophoresis, protein concentration was quantitated by the method of Bradford(36.Bradford M.M. Anal Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar). Particulate fractions were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer(37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar). One-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 35-50 μg of total membrane enriched protein as described by Laemmli(37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205955) Google Scholar). The protein was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining methods as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad).For immunoblotting, gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose, blocked, and blotted as described previously(38.Saez J.C. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E.L. In Vitro Toxicol. 1990; 3: 69-86Google Scholar). All incubations and washes were performed at room temperature. Incubations with primary antibody to Cx43 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody required dilutions of 1:1000. Substrates for immunodetection were added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.), and blots were exposed for various times to Kodak X-Omat AR film.ImmunostainingSite-specific localization of Cx43 immunoreactivity was performed on cells plated on glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PB for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100/PB. Cells were blocked briefly with 3% bovine serum albumin/PB. Primary antibody to Cx43 was added at 1/300 dilution in PB with 1% normal serum and incubated overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed twice for 15 min in PB followed by a 45-min incubation in the dark in the presence of a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250 dilution in PB). Coverslips were mounted onto slides and visualized under broadband fluorescent light using an Olympus microscope set with a blue filter.Alkaline Phosphatase AssayA histological stain was used to evaluate the presence of alkaline phosphatase activity on the surface of cells. Cells on 12-well culture plates were rinsed with distilled water, fixed briefly, stained according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma), and visualized under light microscopy.cAMP RadioimmunoassayFor experiments in which cell confluency was desired, cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 in 12-well dishes cultured for 60 h and exposed in duplicate to 10−11-10−7 M rPTH(1-34) or forskolin at 37°C for 15 min. For subconfluent experiments in which only ROS and bG were used, cells were plated at 5-10,000 cells/cm2, cultured for 48 h, and exposed to 10−11-10−7 M rPTH(1-34). All cAMP assays were performed as described previously(39.Donahue H.J. Fryer M.J. Eriksen E.F. Heath III, H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13522-13527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PTH/PTHrP Receptor BindingBinding assays were performed as described previously(40.McCauley L.K. Beecher C.A. Melton M.E. Werkmeister J.R. Juppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Segre G.V. Rosol T.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1992; 101: 331-336Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in 24-well dishes and grown to confluence. Each assay, performed in triplicate, included the addition of 25,000 cpms of high pressure liquid chromatography-purified, monoiodinated [125I]PTHrP(1-36) in addition to varying concentrations of nonradioactive PTHrP(1-36). Cells were incubated at 4°C for 2 h, followed by removal of unbound peptide, cell lysis, and determination of bound radioactivity by scintillation counting. Parallel cultures were enumerated by trypan blue dye exclusion. The numbers of receptors per cell were calculated from the Bmax values obtained through Scatchard transformation.Statistical AnalysisAll data are reported as means ± S.E. except as noted. One-way analysis of variance followed by Student Neuman Kuells test were used to analyze cell coupling data and cAMP accumulation under various conditions; p values < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSCx43 Antisense Transfectants Are Communication-deficientTransfection with an antisense Cx43 construct produced two clones, RCx4 and RCx16, which consistently exhibited a reduced capacity to transfer dye. Fig. 1 illustrates a typical experiment in which ROS (top) display abundant dye coupling, whereas antisense transfectant, RCx16 (bottom), do not. Fig. 2 summarizes the degree of coupling in ROS, control transfectants (bG), RCx16, and RCx4. ROS and bG displayed similar levels of dye coupling after 5 min (15.5 ± 2.1 and 13.9 ± 1.9, mean ± S.E. number of neighboring cells with dye, respectively). At no time did either ROS or bG, when dye loaded, communicate with less than 10 neighboring cells. However, in the antisense transfectants, RCx4 and RCx16, coupling was reduced more than 9-fold (1.2 ± 1.1 and 1.5 ± 0.8, mean ± S.E. number of neighboring cells with dye, respectively). Thus, although dye coupling was not eliminated, it was dramatically reduced. This reduction was maintained in cells even 30 min after dye loading.Figure 2:Gap junctional coupling in osteoblastic cells. Functional coupling was reduced more than 9-fold in confluent cultures of antisense transfectants RCx4 (1.2 ± 1.1) and RCx16 (1.5 ± 1.3) and in subconfluent ROS (ROS-s; 2.4 ± 1.4) and subconfluent bG (bG-s; 2.1 ± 1.6) as compared with confluent ROS or bG (15.5 ± 2.4 and 13.9 ± 1.9, respectively). Each bar represents the mean (±S.E.) number of adjacent cells that take up dye within 5 min. ∗, significantly different from either ROS or bG (p < 0.01; n = 25-50 cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Gap junction deficiency in both RCx4 and RCx16 was verified by the addition of dbcAMP at 10 μM, a concentration found to enhance functional coupling by as much as 50% in ROS (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate dbcAMP increased coupling in both ROS and bG by 49.8 and 48.6%, respectively. Functional coupling increased within 10 min in both ROS and bG and peaked in ROS by 30 min and in bG by 40 min. On the other hand, dye coupling was unaffected by dbcAMP in RCx16 and RCx4 (6.7 and 0.92% increase over basal, respectively).Figure 3:Effect of dbcAMP on gap junctional coupling in osteoblastic cells. Cells plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 were exposed to either 10 μM dbcAMP or vehicle control. Functional coupling was quantified by dye injections with 0.1 mM carboxyfluorescein at room temperature. The number of neighboring cells with dye was recorded every 5 min for 80 min. The addition of dbcAMP increased coupling in ROS (thick solid line) and bG (thick dashed lines) by 50% within 20 or 30 min, respectively. The inability of antisense transfectants RCx4 (thin solid line) and RCx16 (thin dashed line) to significantly up-regulate functional coupling in response to dbcAMP demonstrates that Cx43 expression had been successfully reduced and that neither recruitable membrane nor cytoplasmic Cx43 protein reserves were sufficiently available to enable maximal dye coupling. Each data point represents the mean (±S.E.) number of cells coupled (n = 3). ∗, significantly different from basal values within each group (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine if uncoupling with antisense transfection was reflected in Cx43 mRNA levels, Northern blot analysis was performed on transfected and nontransfected ROS. Fig. 4A demonstrates that both ROS (lane 1) and control transfectants, bG (lane 2), expressed abundant Cx43 mRNA of approximately 3.0 kb in size. Cx43-deficient clones, RCx4 (lane 3) and RCx16 (lane 4), displayed virtual elimination of Cx43 mRNA expression. Normalization of mRNA abundance to GAPDH, a gene with transcription levels in ROS that remained stable independent of plating density, revealed that mRNA levels in RCx16 and RCx4 were reduced by 78 and 92%, respectively, relative to ROS (Fig. 4B).Figure 4:Connexin43 and GAPDH mRNA expression in osteoblastic cells. 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern blot analysis using either a 890-base pair rat Cx43 cDNA radiolabeled probe (A) or a 1.4-kb rat GAPDH radiolabeled probe (B). RCx4 clones displayed a lack of Cx43 mRNA (A, lane 3), whereas RCx16 displayed a decreased expression (A, lane 4) relative to ROS (A, lane 1) and bG (A, lane 2). All cells examined displayed equivalent mRNA expression of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH (B). These data are typical of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Western blot analysis of transfected and nontransfected cells revealed a pattern of Cx43 protein expression similar to that observed for mRNA expression and functional coupling experiments (Fig. 5). ROS (lane 1) and bG (lane 2) showed the predominant presence of a 43-kDa band consistent with the nonphosphorylated form of Cx43 (Cx43-NP) from rat heart(3.Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Moreno A.P. Spray D.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 163-197PubMed Google Scholar). ROS and bG also expressed two bands (Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2) at reduced levels relative to Cx43-NP, also consistent with the expression of two phosphorylated forms of Cx43(3.Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Moreno A.P. Spray D.C. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1993; 27: 163-197PubMed Google Scholar). In both antisense transfected clones, RCx4 and RCx16, a greater than 86% reduction in expression for all forms of Cx43 protein was observed using the polyclonal antibody to rat Cx43.Figure 5:Western blot analysis of connexin43 protein in osteoblastic cells. Equivalent amounts of total cell extract enriched for membrane proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed using a polyclonal antibody to rat Cx43. Lack of immunoreactivity for nonphosphorylated Cx43 (Cx43-NP) and all phosphorylated forms (Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2) was observed for RCx4 (lane 3). RCx16 demonstrated greatly reduced immunoreacitivity for all Cx43 forms, whereas ROS (lane 1) and bG (lane 2) showed abundant immunoreactivity for all forms of Cx43 protein. These data are typical of three similar experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Indirect immunostaining of ROS (Fig. 6A) revealed punctate distribution of Cx43 immunoreactivity particularly abundant at the interface of adjoining cells. Numerous immunoreactive sites within the cytoplasm, located primarily along the perinuclear border, were also apparent. Although this pattern of staining was observed in bG, there was no Cx43 immunoreactivity at the cell membrane interface or within the cytoplasm in either RCx4 (data not shown) or RCx16 (Fig. 6B).Figure 6:Photomicrographs of Cx43 immunoreactivity in osteoblastic cells. Cells plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 and grown for 48 h were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody to rat Cx43.

https://openalex.org/W2081433490,"Escherichia coli HU, a nonsequence-specific histone- and HMG-like DNA-binding protein, was chemically converted into a series of HU-nucleases with an iron–EDTA-based cleavage moiety positioned at 16 rationally selected sites. Specific DNA cleavage patterns from each of these HU-nucleases allowed us to determine the precise localization, stoichiometry, and orientation of HU binding in the Mu transpososome, a multiprotein structure that mediates the chemical reactions in DNA transposition. Correlation of the DNA cleavage data with the position of the cleavage moiety in the HU three-dimensional structure indicates the presence of a dramatic DNA bend, for which the bend center, direction, and magnitude were assessed. The data, which directly localize selected HU amino acids with respect to DNA in the transpososome, were used as constraints for computer-based molecular modeling to derive the first snapshot of an HU–DNA interaction."

Our experiments suggest that Grap and Grb2 are members of the same adaptor protein family with overlapping yet distinct expression patterns and possibly functions. Several cDNA clones highly homologous to grb2 were identified from human cDNA libraries made from a 6-week-old embryo or tonsils. A data base containing approximately 500,000 human partial cDNA sequences (expressed sequence tags) has been established in a collaborative effort of The Institute for Genomic Research and Human Genome Sciences Inc., using high throughput automated DNA sequence analysis of randomly selected human cDNA clones(16.Adams M.D. Kelley J.M.

Sequence homology comparison of each expressed sequence tag was performed with the blastn and tblastn algorithms against the GenBank™ data base. The MO7e megakaryocytic cell line, TF1 erythroleukemia cell line, the MO7eR cell overexpressing erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), and the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line were obtained from Dr. H. E. Broxmeyer (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) and maintained according to standard protocols. Purified anti-mSos1, anti-c-kit, anti-Grb2, and anti-c-Abl antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Rabbit anti-EpoR was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (PY20) and Upstate Biotechnology Inc (4G10). Two Northern blot filters containing approximately 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane from various human tissues were purchased from Clontech. Northern blotting was performed with the Expresshyb Hybridization Solution (PT1190-1) from Clontech following the manufacturer's manual. DNA probes for grap and grb2 were labeled with 32P using a randomly primed kit from Boehringer Mannheim. The corresponding cDNA fragments were isolated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the appropriate sites of pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All of the constructs were reconfirmed by sequencing and transformed into the bacterial strain BL21 (Pharmacia). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fusion proteins were purified from cell lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia). Purified GST-GrapSH2 fusion protein was injected into New Zealand female rabbits for production of specific anti-Grap antiserum according to standard protocols. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were conducted as described previously (19.Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T.

Briefly, specific antibodies were incubated with cell lysates containing 1 mg of total proteins in the presence of protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4°C. For in vitro binding experiments, purified GST-fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were mixed with cell lysates for 1.5 h at 4°C. After washing, the resulting precipitates on the beads were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The resolved proteins were probed with specific antibodies and then a second antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The filters were developed by chemiluminescent reaction and exposed to radiographic film. Several cDNA inserts homologous to grb2 were found during sequencing of cDNA libraries derived from a 6-week-old human embryo or tonsils. One of the clones (1.7 kb, HGS code: 285076) containing an open reading frame for a 217-amino acid protein (Fig. 1) was resequenced on both strands by the dideoxy method using a kit from United States Biochemical Inc. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, this protein is comprised of a central SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. This Grb2/Sem-5/Drk-like arrangement is characteristic of an adaptor protein apparently lacking catalytic activities. Therefore, we suggest a name Grap for Grb2-related adaptor protein. The amino acid sequence of Grap was compared with Grb2, Sem-5, and Drk, and the percentage of identical amino acids is shown in Table 1. Overall, Grap is most closely related to Grb2. The SH2 domain of Grap shows high homology to Grb2/Sem-5/Drk and contains all the conserved amino acid sequences that form the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. Highest homology between these molecules is in the SH3N domain, while the SH3C domain appears less conserved. The similarity of Grb2 to Sem-5 and Drk is higher than that of Grap to the two lower eukaryotic molecules, suggesting that Grb2 rather than Grap is the mammalian homologue of Sem-5/Drk. Indeed, Stern and his collaborators (12.Stern M.J. Marengere L.M. Daly R.J. Lowenstein E.J. Kokel M. Batzer A. Olivier P. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that grb2 as well as drk can specifically rescue the sem-5 mutation in C. elegans(12.Stern M.J. Marengere L.M. Daly R.J.

It will be interesting to check if grap can also replace the function of sem-5 in worms.Tabled 1 The mammalian grb2 gene is widely expressed in developing mouse embryos and various adult tissues(2.Lowenstein E.J.

To examine the expression of the grap gene, we performed Northern blot analysis on various human tissues. As shown in Fig. 2, a 2.3-kb transcript was detected using 32P-labeled grap cDNA as a probe. The grap gene was primarily expressed in thymus and spleen, although lower levels of transcription were detected in many other tissues (Fig. 2). When the filters were reprobed with 32P-labeled grb2 cDNA, two grb2 transcripts of 3.8 kb and 1.5 kb were observed in all the tissues (Fig. 2), as reported previously(2.Lowenstein E.J. Daly E.J.

By immunizing rabbits with a purified GST-fusion protein containing the GrapSH2 domain, we have successfully produced specific antiserum against Grap that works very well in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The antibody specifically recognized a 27-kDa polypeptide in human cells, as compared to 23-kDa Grb2 (Fig. 3). It should be noted that most commercially available anti-Grb2 antibodies cross-react with Grap (Fig. 3). Conversely, a little cross-reaction of our anti-Grap antiserum with Grb2 was observed only after a long exposure of the immunoblot filters. The slower migration of Grap than Grb2 distinguishes the two proteins despite their identical predicted size. Highest amounts of Grap protein were in mouse thymus and spleen; lower levels were detected in lung, liver, kidney, heart, and brain (data not shown). These results suggest that Grap is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells, and, indeed, Grap was easily detected in MO7e, MO7eR, TF1, and K562 cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3). The structure of Grap suggests that it functions as an adaptor molecule mediating protein-protein interaction. Purified GST-fusion proteins containing the GrapSH2 or Grb2SH2 domain were mixed with lysates of MO7e or MO7eR cells that were stimulated with or without stem cell factor or Epo, respectively. The SH2-binding proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) or to specific receptors. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the SH2 domains of Grap and Grb2 bound to the ligand-activated c-kit and EpoR; however, the binding affinity of GrapSH2 was apparently lower than that of Grb2SH2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results were obtained by immunoblot analysis of the specific anti-Grap or anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Bcr-Abl fusion protein is an up-regulated PTK implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It has been demonstrated that Bcr-Abl forms a physical complex with Syp and Grb2(15.Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J.

To detect the interaction between Grap and Bcr-Abl, Grap was immunoprecipitated from a K562 cell lysate and the precipitates were blotted with anti-c-Abl. As shown in Fig. 4C, Grap co-precipitated from K562 cells with Bcr-Abl and purified GST-GrapSH2 bound Bcr-Abl in vitro. These results indicate that Grap, like Grb2, forms a stable complex through its SH2 domain with the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in leukemia cells. The SH3 domains, particularly the SH3N domain, of Grb2/Sem-5/Drk bind the C-terminal tail of the mSos1 protein(4.Olivier J.P. Raabe T. Henkemeyer M. Dickson B. Mbamalu G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J.

Co-immunoprecipitation shows that Grap is constitutively associated with mSos1 in TF1 cells (Fig. 4D). In vitro binding assay using purified GST-fusion proteins containing different Grap motifs demonstrates that the SH3N domain is responsible for Grap-mSos1 interaction (Fig. 4D). There is no detectable binding of the GrapSH2 and -SH3C domains to mSos1. The physical complex of Grap and mSos1 was also easily detected in MO7e and several other cell lines (data not shown). In summary, we have described a human cytoplasmic signaling protein that shares structural and functional similarity with Grb2. Both proteins contain a central SH2 domain sandwiched by two SH3 domains. The SH2 domains directly recognize phosphotyrosine-containing sites on activated receptor PTKs and cytoplasmic proteins. Its binding specificity is often dictated by the three amino acids C-terminal to phosphotyrosine (the +1- to +3-positions). A Trp residue in the EF1 position of the +3 binding pocket in Grb2SH2 was critical in defining specificity(24.Marengere L.E.M. Songyang Z. Gish G.D. Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Stern M.J. Cantley L.C. Pawson T. Nature. 1994; 369: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is of great interest that the GrapSH2 has a Trp at the same position (Fig. 1) in addition to its high homology with Grb2SH2. Results from Fig. 4, demonstrate that the SH2 domains of Grap and Grb2 bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated c-kit, EpoR, and Bcr-Abl. We also observed that the two SH2 domains bind to a similar group of phosphoproteins in v-src transformed cells in vitro (data not shown). Further experiments are needed to determine whether the two SH2 domains recognize and compete for the same phosphotyrosine motifs in these activated receptors in vivo and select identical phosphopeptide sequences in vitro(25.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). Grap appears to form a physical complex with mSos1 through its SH3N domain (Fig. 4D). This agrees with previous observations that the SH3N domain is primarily involved in association of Drk and Grb2 to Sos and mSos1, respectively(7.Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 23.Raabe T. Olivier J.P. Dickson B. Liu X. Gish G.D. Pawson T. Hafen E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2509-2518Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Notably, higher similarities between these proteins are often seen in the SH3N region, and the SH3C domains appear less conserved. It seems reasonable that the SH3C domain of Grap may couple to other signaling pathways by binding yet-to-be identified proteins. For example, Grap may couple to other guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Ras, Rac, or Rho. The SH3 domains of Grb2 are also reported to associate with c-Cbl(26.Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T.

It will be worthwhile to examine whether the GrapSH3 domains form complexes with these proteins.

Internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA (DNA ladders) was detected in cells grown with 5 μM and 0 μM choline for 72 h. Cells treated with 0 or 5 μM choline for 72 h detached from the substrate in high numbers (58% of choline deficient cells vs. 1.4% of choline sufficient cells detached) exhibited a high incidence of apoptosis (apoptotic bodies were seen in 55-75% of cells; 67-73% had DNA strand breaks), and an absence of mitosis and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. Cells undergoing DNA fragmentation had functioning mitochondria. At 24 h, cells grown in 0 or 5 μM choline synthesized DNA more rapidly than those grown in 70 μM choline. By 72 h, the cells grown in 0 or 5 μM choline were forming DNA much more slowly than control cells (assessed by thymidine incorporation, PCNA expression, and mitotic index). Western blot analysis showed that p53 in the nucleus of cells was detected in direct association with SV40 T-antigen, and was therefore likely to be inactive. We conclude that choline deficiency kills CWSV-1 hepatocytes in culture by inducing apoptosis via what may be a p53-independent process, and that this process begins in viable cells before they detach from the culture dish.—Albright, C.

https://openalex.org/W1903208355,"Aggrecans and PG-M/vereicans represent two newly defined families of hyaluronan-bind-ing proteoglycans for which the function is still poorly understood. Using the avian neural crest as a model system, we have examined the molecular mechanisms entailed in the cell-proteoglycan interaction during embryonic cell motility. Both the primary cartilage aggrecan of the avian embryo (PG-H/aggrecan) and the largest variant of the avian mesenchymal versican (PG-M/versican VO) failed to support neural crest cell adhesion and migration when topographically immobilized onto the substrate. Conversely, solely the PG-H/aggrecan, and similar aggrecans from other species, counteracted the migration-promoting effect of a number of matrix molecules lacking pro-teoglycan affinity. This inhibitory effect was not reproduced by the isolated glycosaminoglycan chains, the isolated core protein, the reduced and alkylated macromolecule, or the aggrecan in which the Gl hyaluronan-binding domain had been inactivated with hyaluronan fragments or antibodies. Limited depolymerization of the side chains and preincubation of the PG-H/aggrecan with anti-gly-coeaminoglycan antibodies differentially reduced the inhibitory activity of the proteoglycan on cell motility. The results demonstrate a diverse inhibitory effect of aggrecans and PG-M/vereicans on embryonic cell movement and show that the inhibitory action of aggrecans is independent of substrate binding, is depedent on a Gl domain-mediated association of the intact proteoglycan with cell surface-bound hyaluronan, and is differentially mediated by its glycosaminoglycan side chains.—Perris, R., Perissinotto, D., Pettway, Z., Bronner-Fraser, M., Mörgelin, M., Kimata, K.

The effects of GM-CSF are mediated through a high affinity receptor that is composed of two chains: a unique, ligand-specific α chain and a β common chain (βc) that is also a component of the receptors for interleukin 3 (IL-3) and IL-5. βc plays an essential role in the transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus through its recruitment of secondary messengers. Several downstream signaling events induced by GM-CSF stimulation have been described, including activation of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (including βc) and activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways. A region within the βc cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 517-763) has been reported to be necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein, Shc, and for the subsequent GM-CSF-induced activation of Ras. In this paper, we describe a physical association between the tyrosine phosphorylated GM-CSF receptor (GMR)-βc chain and Shc in vivo. Using a series of cytoplasmic truncation mutants of βc and various mutant Shc proteins, we demonstrate that the N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain of Shc binds to a short region of βc (amino acids 549-656) that contains Tyr577.

https://openalex.org/W2152772170,"ABSTRACT: Under resting conditions, steady-state [Ca] in agonist-sensitive Ca stores reflects a balance between active uptake (usually mediated by a thap-sigargin-sensitive Ca-ATPase of the SERCA family) and passive efflux of Ca. Even though this pump-leak cycle appears to be a common property of Ca-storing organelles, little is known about the nature of the leak pathway. Ca homeostasis in thapsigargin-sensitive internal Ca stores of single permeabilized BHK-21 fibroblasts was examined using digital image processing of compartmentalized mag-fura-2 (a low-affinity Ca indicator). It is shown here that the leak of Ca from internal stores is regulated specifically by the cytosolic ATP concentration. The rate of leak was 3.6 times slower in 0.375 mM [ATP] than in 4 mM [ATP] (Na or Mg salt). These effects were observed in the presence of 0 Ca/EGTA, thapsigargin, heparin, and ruthenium red, and therefore appear to be independent of the Ca-ATPase, the InsP3 receptor and the ryanodine receptor. The ATP-stimulated leak was seen in a variety of cell types, including rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Other nucleotides (ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMP-PNP and ATPγS) did not reproduce the action of ATP. Changes in cellular metabolism and ensuing alterations in [ATP] will be expected to influence the filling state of internal Ca stores through effects on the passive leak pathway, potentially leading to modulation of Ca signaling and organellar function.—Hofer, A.

https://openalex.org/W1924798630,"The incorporation of radioactivity from 14C-labeled compounds into metabolic intermediates and total lipids was examined in 3T3 adipocytes. The heterocyclic sulfonamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (SCAI) 6-ethoxyzolamide (ETZ) caused a decrease (42-7% of control, IC50 = 2.2 ± 1.1 X 10−7 M) in the incorporation of [14C]bicarbon- ate into several Krebs cycle intermediates in 3T3- F442A adipocytes. This decrease in pyruvate carboxylase-mediated [14C] carbon fixation was associated with a reduction in fluorometrically determined [citrate] and [malate]. The ability of ETZ to decrease both the incorporation of radioactivity into and the concentrations of Krebs cycle intermediates was not of sufficient magnitude to lower [ATP], but was associated with a decrease in de novo lipogenesis from [14C]ghicose. De novo lipogenesis was also inhibited to a similar extent by trifluormethanesul- fonamide, an aliphatic SCAI, which suggests that the effects are mediated by carbonic anhydrase. ETZ did not inhibit de novo lipogenesis from [14C] glutamine (12.38 ± 1.068 nmol/mg protein, ETZ; 12.5 ± 0.846 nmol/mg protein, DMSO). This suggests that ETZ inhibition of lipogenesis involves an inhibitory effect on pyruvate carboxylase as opposed to acetyl CoA carboxylase, because the incorporation of glutamine into lipids does not involve pyruvate carboxylase. Decreased de novo lipogenesis was also observed by incubating cultures in media that contained 1 mM bicarbonate (atmosphere:100% humidified air) rather than 25 mM bicarbonate (atmosphere: 95% humidified air/5% CO2). This suggests that exogenous CO2/bicarbonate may be required to sustain maximal rates of de novo lipogenesis. Because these results implied that CA V, the mitochondrial isoform of carbonic anhydrase, might be present in adipocytes, CA V levels were measured by immunoblotting. Mitochondrial preparations of adipocytes and liver were found to contain similar concentrations of CA V. Unlike adipocyte CA III, CA V concentrations were not significantly different in lean and obese Zucker rats. However, CA V levels were ninefold higher in differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes compared to undifferentiated adipoblasts. Our data indicate that CA V is relatively abundant in adipocyte mitochondria and exhibits differentiation-dependent expression like pyruvate carboxylase and the cytosolic isozymes CA II and CA III.

The dissociation constants of spermidine for the mutated PotD proteins at Glu-171, Trp-255, and Asp-257 increased greatly in comparison with those for the other mutated PotD proteins. Since these three amino acids clearly interact with the diaminopropane moiety of spermidine, the results are in accordance with the finding that PotD protein has a higher affinity for spermidine than for putrescine. Putrescine was found to bind at the position of the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine. The polyamine content in cells, which plays important roles in cell proliferation and differentiation(1.Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3235) Google Scholar, 2.Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar), is regulated by polyamine biosynthesis, degradation, and transport. As for the latter, we obtained and characterized three clones of polyamine transport genes (pPT104, pPT79, and pPT71) in Escherichia coli(3.Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The system encoded by pPT104 is the spermidine-preferential uptake system, and that by pPT79 is the putrescine-specific uptake system. Furthermore, these two systems are periplasmic transport systems(4.Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), each consisting of four kinds of proteins: the pPT104 clone encodes PotA, PotB, PotC, and PotD proteins, and the pPT79 clone encodes PotF, PotG, PotH, and PotI proteins, judging from the deduced amino acid sequences of their nucleotide sequences(6.Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PotD and PotF proteins are periplasmic substrate-binding proteins, and PotA and PotG proteins are membrane-associated proteins with a nucleotide-binding site. PotB and PotC proteins and PotH and PotI proteins are transmembrane proteins that probably form channels for spermidine and putrescine, respectively. Their amino acid sequences in the corresponding proteins are similar to each other. In contrast, the putrescine transport system encoded by pPT71 consists of one membrane protein (PotE protein) with 12 transmembrane segments (8.Kashiwagi K. Suzuki T. Suzuki F. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20922-20927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is active in the excretion of putrescine from cells through putrescine-ornithine antiporter activity (9.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Suzuki F. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4529-4533Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We also found that spermidine uptake by membrane vesicles is strongly dependent on PotD protein, and the uptake by intact cells is completely dependent on ATP through its binding to PotA protein(10.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PotA protein was shown to have ATPase activity, and its association with membranes is strengthened by the existence of channel-forming PotB and PotC proteins(11.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25377-25382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, we determined the crystal structure of PotD protein in a complex with spermidine at 2.5-Å resolution(12.Sugiyama S. Matsushima M. Saisho T. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1996; 52: 416-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It was revealed that four acidic and five aromatic amino acid residues in PotD protein interact with spermidine(13.Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In this study, we tried to identify the amino acid residues in PotD protein that are involved in the binding of spermidine by using mutated PotD protein produced by site-directed mutagenesis of the potD gene. We found that Glu-171, Trp-255, and Asp-257, among 13 amino acids involved in the interaction with spermidine, are particularly important in the recognition. A polyamine-requiring mutant, E. coli DR112(14.Linderoth N. Morris D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), provided by Dr. D. R. Morris (University of Washington), was grown as described previously(15.Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3131-3135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 (Δ(lac-pro), supE, thi, hsdD5/F‘traD36, proA+B+, lacIq, lacZΔM15), which has a higher transformation efficiency, was grown in 2YT medium(16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A1-A3Google Scholar). A spermidine transport- and polyamine biosynthesis-deficient mutant, MA261 potD::Km(10.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was grown in medium A in the absence of polyamines as described previously(17.Kashiwagi K. Yamaguchi Y. Sakai Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8387-8391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pPT86 containing the potABC gene and pUCpotD were prepared as described previously(10.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMWpotD was prepared by inserting the 1.7-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pUCpotD into the same restriction site of pMW119(18.Yamaguchi K. Masamune Y. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transformation of E. coli cells with plasmids was carried out as described by Maniatis et al.(19.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 250-251Google Scholar). Appropriate antibiotics (30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 50 μg/ml kanamycin) were added during the culture of E. coli cells. To prepare potD mutants, a 1.7-kilobase EcoRI-HindIII fragment of pUCpotD was inserted into the same site of M13mp19(20.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method of Sayers et al.(21.Sayers J.R. Krekel C. Eckstein F. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 592-596PubMed Google Scholar) with a Sculptor™ in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Corp.), using the oligonucleotides shown in Table 1. The mutated DNA fragments were isolated from the replicative form of M13 and religated into the same site of pUCpotD. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52745) Google Scholar) using the M13 phage system (20.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar) with commercial and synthesized primers.Tabled 1 Right-side-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli DR112/pPT86 as described previously(23.Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic proteins were obtained from E. coli TG1 containing pUCpotD- or pUC-mutated potD according to the method of Oliver and Beckwith(24.Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1982; 30: 311-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). PotD protein occupied ∼60% of the total periplasmic proteins, and they were used for the PotD protein source. The reaction mixture (0.1 ml; containing 20 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), 50 mM HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mM MgSO4, 20 mMD-lactate (lithium salt), 100 μg of membrane vesicle protein, 70 μg of PotD or mutated PotD protein, and 20 μM [14C]putrescine (4.07 GBq/mmol) or 4 μM [14C]spermidine (4.07 GBq/mmol)) was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Membrane vesicles were collected on membrane filters (cellulose acetate, 0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo), and the radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Protein content was measured by the method of Lowry et al.(25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.1 ml; containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mM KCl, and a combination of 10 μg of PotD protein and 4 μM [14C]spermidine (2.03 GBq/mmol) or 100 μg of PotD protein and 35 μM [14C]putrescine (4.07 GBq/mmol)) was incubated at 30°C for 5 min. PotD protein was collected on membrane filters (cellulose nitrate, 0.45 μm; Advantec Toyo), and the radioactivity was counted with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of binding sites (Bmax) of spermidine for PotD protein were calculated from a Scatchard plot (26.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 84: 4767-4771Google Scholar) by changing the substrate concentrations from 1 to 50 μM. E. coli MA261 potD::Km containing pMWpotD- or pMW-mutated potD was grown in medium A until A540 reached 0.3. The assay for spermidine uptake was performed as described previously(23.Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 972-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 1 μM (4.07 GBq/mmol) or 10 μM (370 MBq/mmol) [14C]spermidine was used as substrate. Recently, we determined the tertiary structure of PotD protein in a complex with spermidine by x-ray crystallographic analysis(13.Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows 13 amino acids (Trp-34, Thr-35, Glu-36, Tyr-37, Ser-83, Tyr-85, Asp-168, Glu-171, Trp-229, Trp-255, Asp-257, Tyr-293, and Gln-327) 1Numbers of amino acids start from methionine for initiation. Thus, the 23 amino acids corresponding to the signal peptide are actually released from PotD protein. that may be involved in the spermidine binding. In addition, it has been reported that Tyr-86 and Arg-170 might also participate in the spermidine binding from the prediction of the structural similarity between PotD protein and maltose-binding protein(27.Matsuo Y. Nishikawa K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, we prepared PotD proteins mutated at the 15 amino acids listed above by site-directed mutagenesis of the potD gene (Table 1) and analyzed the activities of the mutated PotD proteins by three different assay methods. First, spermidine and putrescine uptake activities were measured using right-side-out membrane vesicles and PotD or mutated PotD protein. Right-side-out membrane vesicles were prepared from E. coli DR112/pPT86, in which relatively large amounts of PotA, PotB, and PotC proteins are synthesized(6.Furuchi T. Kashiwagi K. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20928-20933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Periplasmic protein prepared from E. coli TG1/pUCpotD was used as the source of PotD and mutated PotD proteins. Spermidine uptake activities decreased greatly with mutated PotD proteins (W255L 2The mutated PotD protein W255L contains leucine instead of tryptophan at position 255. and D257N) in which a closely located amino acid or one interacting with the secondary amine of spermidine is modified (Fig. 1B). The activity also decreased with all mutated PotD proteins (E36Q, T35A, Y37A, Y293A, W229L, W34L, E171Q, S83A, D168N, and Q327A) whose amino acids were strongly suggested to be involved in the binding of spermidine by x-ray analysis. Spermidine uptake activities with other mutated PotD proteins (Y86A and R170L) did not change significantly (data not shown). Putrescine uptake activity greatly decreased with certain mutated PotD proteins (E36Q, Y37A, Y293A, W34L, and D257N) in which an amino acid interacting with the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine is modified (Fig. 1B). The activity did not significantly decrease with other mutated PotD proteins (E171Q, Y85A, and D168N) in which an amino acid interacting with the aminopropyl moiety of spermidine is modified. The mutated PotD protein W255L slightly decreased the activity. The results indicate that putrescine occupies the position corresponding to the binding site of the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine in PotD protein. It should also be noted that the substitution of Thr-35, which was involved in the binding of spermidine, was not connected with the interaction with putrescine. Polyamine binding to PotD protein was measured using 4 μM spermidine or 35 μM putrescine as substrate. As shown in Fig. 1C, the amounts of spermidine bound to the mutated PotD proteins almost paralleled the spermidine uptake activities of the proteins except for the E36Q mutated protein. The release of spermidine from this mutated protein may be slower than that from the others. Putrescine binding was measured using a 10 times greater amount of mutated PotD protein since the affinity for putrescine (Kd = 100 μM) is much lower than that for spermidine (Kd = 3.2 μM) (7.Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of putrescine bound to the mutated PotD proteins also almost paralleled the putrescine uptake activities of the proteins. Since the W255L mutated protein significantly decreased both the putrescine uptake and binding activities, Trp-255 may also be involved in the interaction with the primary amine of putrescine, which corresponds to the secondary amine of spermidine. Spermidine uptake activities were measured with E. coli MA261 potD::Km containing pMW-mutated potD, in which the expression of PotD or mutated PotD protein was about four times greater than that in wild-type MA261 cells. The activity with intact cells was measured with 1 or 10 μM spermidine, as the Km value for spermidine is 0.1 μM(3.Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it was observed to be much greater than that with right-side-out membrane vesicles and PotD protein. One reason for this was that the possibility of PotD protein interaction with the channel-forming PotB and PotC proteins was increased by the existence of the outer membrane. When the activity was measured in intact cells, the difference among the activities of the mutated PotD proteins became more pronounced. As shown in Table 2, Asp-257 was the most important amino acid for recognition of spermidine, with Trp-255 and Glu-171 also being strongly involved. Other mutated PotD proteins slightly decreased the spermidine uptake activity, but the mutated PotD protein S83A did not. Replacement of Asp-257 by Glu resulted in uptake activity at 70% of normal PotD protein, indicating that a negative charge at position 257 is important (data not shown).Tabled 1 The dissociation constants (Kd) and the number of binding sites (Bmax) of spermidine for the mutated PotD proteins were then measured. Since the Bmax value (1 mol/PotD protein) did not change significantly, the change in binding affinity was mainly due to the change in the Kd values. As shown in Table 2, the Kd value of spermidine for normal PotD protein was estimated to be 3.7 μM. However, the Kd values of spermidine for the three mutated proteins D257N, W255L, and E171Q increased greatly, paralleling the decrease in spermidine uptake activities of intact cells. We previously reported that the concentration of spermidine-PotD protein in the periplasm would be ∼3.1 μM if the spermidine concentration was 0.1 μM under standard conditions (10.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acids involved in the recognition of spermidine are summarized in Fig. 2. There were four acidic amino acids, three tyrosines, three tryptophans, and one molecule each of serine, threonine, and glutamine, and they were classified into three groups: most strongly involved, Asp-257, Glu-171, and Trp-255; moderately involved, Asp-168, Trp-34, Trp-229, Tyr-85, and Tyr-293; and weakly involved, Glu-36, Tyr-37, Thr-35, Ser-83, and Gln-327. The spermidine-preferential uptake system belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily(4.Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 397-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Higgins C.F. Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The tertiary structures of several periplasmic substrate-binding proteins in the ATP-binding cassette superfamily have been characterized by x-ray crystal structural analysis(28.Adams M.D. Oxender D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15739-15742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Yao N. Trakhanov S. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4769-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 30.Oh B. Kang C. De Bondt H. Kim S. Nikaido K. Joshi A.K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol.

The structural similarity among substrate-binding proteins is striking. There are two globular domains connected by short peptide segments. Between the domains lies a large cleft that binds the substrate. Furthermore, structure/function analysis of histidine-binding protein was performed with several mutated histidine-binding proteins(32.Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Nikaido K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23051-23058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Wolf A. Shaw E.W. Oh B. De Bondt H. Joshi A.K. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16097-16106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of PotD protein, it was suggested by x-ray crystal structural analysis (13.Sugiyama S. Vassylyev D.G. Matsushima M. Kashiwagi K. Igarashi K. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9519-9525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) that 13 amino acids may be involved in the interaction with spermidine. In this study, we tried to identify the amino acids that are involved in the binding of spermidine by measuring spermidine uptake activities of right-side-out membrane vesicles and intact cells with mutated PotD proteins as well as spermidine binding activities of mutated PotD proteins. We found that amino acids, especially Glu-171, Trp-255, and Asp-257, involved in the interaction with the diaminopropane moiety of spermidine are more crucial in the binding of spermidine to PotD protein than those involved in the interaction with the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine. Putrescine was found to bind at the position of the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine. These results explain why spermidine has a higher affinity for PotD protein than putrescine. Among the above three amino acids, Asp-257, which interacts with the secondary amine of spermidine, is most strongly involved in the binding to spermidine. In this connection, it should be noted that the secondary amine of spermidine or spermine most effectively contributes to the interaction with tRNA(34.Frydman L. Rossomando P.C. Frydman V. Fernandez C.O. Frydman B. Samejima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9186-9190Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The putrescine-specific uptake system encoded by pPT79 also belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily(7.Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PotF protein is a substrate-binding protein that exists in periplasm. The amino acid sequences of PotD and PotF proteins exhibit 35% homology, indicating that the two proteins have similar three-dimensional structures (Fig. 3). However, Tyr-85, Trp-255, and Gln-327, which are involved in the interaction with the aminopropyl moiety of spermidine, are missing at the equivalent positions in PotF protein. On the other hand, Trp-34, Tyr-37, Trp-229, Asp-257, and Tyr-293, which recognize the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine, exist at the equivalent positions in PotF protein. In PotF protein, Thr-35 and Glu-36, which also recognize the diaminobutane moiety of spermidine, were replaced by Ser and Asp, respectively. The affinity of PotF protein for putrescine was stronger than that of PotD protein(7.Pistocchi R. Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Sadakata Y. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 146-152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Kashiwagi K. Miyamoto S. Nukui E. Kobayashi H. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19358-19363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the side chains of Ser and Asp are smaller than those of Thr and Glu, putrescine may be accommodated easily into the cleft between the N- and C-terminal domains of PotF protein. In this regard, it should be noted that Thr-35 of PotD protein was involved in the recognition of spermidine, but not putrescine."
https://openalex.org/W1787584463,"This study was conducted to determine whether serine proteinases may induce [Ca(2+)]i mobilization in different hematopoietic cell lines and to analyze their mechanisms of action. We show that in addition to thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRP, SFLLRN), trypsin induced [Ca(2+)]i mobilization in a highly thrombin-sensitive Jurkat T cell clone. Thrombin, TRP, and trypsin were found to induce [Ca(2+)]i release in three different Jurkat T cell clones differing in the level of T cell receptor expression. Similar results were obtained with a prothymocytic leukemic cell line, HPB.ALL, although these cells were much more responsive to trypsin than to thrombin and TRP. Other cell types such as THP1, a myelomonocytic cell line, or CEM, a CD4(+) positive leukemic cell line, were unresponsive to thrombin, TRP, and trypsin. The effect of trypsin was mimicked by SLIGRL, a peptide corresponding to the cleaved amino-terminal sequence of the recently characterized murine trypsin-activated receptor (PAR2). At suboptimal concentrations, the effects of SFLLRN and SLIGRL were additive, whereas saturating doses of peptides did not further increase [Ca(2+)]i mobilization in Jurkat T cells, indicating that both peptides were able to mobilize the same pool of calcium. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from different leukemic cell lines indicated a remarkable correlation between PAR2 expression in different cell lines and SLIGRL or trypsin responses in the same cells. The expression of the ""trypsin receptor"" was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, a 24 h treatment of Jurkat cells by an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, a condition known to down-regulate thrombin receptor expression, induced loss of thrombin and TRP responses but only partially affected trypsin stimulation of [Ca(2+)]i release. Finally, after a first stimulation with either thrombin or trypsin, Jurkat cells were still able to respond to trypsin or thrombin, respectively, demonstrating that thrombin and trypsin essentially activated their own receptors. Our data provided evidence that 1) the human T leukemic cell line Jurkat and other T cell lines express at least two different functional protease-activated receptors, the thrombin receptor and a highly sensitive trypsin receptor, likely the human counterpart of the murine PAR2, and 2) at variance with the commonly accepted model, trypsin exerts most of its effect in T leukemic cell lines by thrombin receptor-independent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2088656945,"Retinoids are important physiological agents that regulate epithelial cell differentiation and proliferation. The importance of these agents in regulating growth, development, and differentiation has led to a search for new retinoid agonists and antagonists. In the present manuscript we show that AGN193109, a retinoid analog, is an efficient antagonist of retinoid action in human cervical epithelial cells. Treatment of ECE16-1 cells with natural or synthetic retinoids reduces cytokeratin K5, K6, K14, K16, and K17 levels, increases cytokeratin K7, K8, and K19 levels, increases retinoic acid receptor-β (RARβ) mRNA levels, suppresses proliferation, and alters cell morphology. Co-treatment with AGN193109 prevents these responses. Half-maximal and maximal antagonism is observed at a molar ratio of AGN193109:retinoid agonist of 1:1 and 10:1, respectively. When administered alone AGN193109 has no agonist activity. Thus, AGN193109, which binds to RARα, RARβ, and RARγ with Kd values = 2, 2, and 3 nM, respectively, but is unable to bind to the retinoid X receptors, is a highly active antagonist of retinoid action in ECE16-1 cells.

Co-treatment with AGN193109 prevents these responses. Half-maximal and maximal antagonism is observed at a molar ratio of AGN193109:retinoid agonist of 1:1 and 10:1, respectively. When administered alone AGN193109 has no agonist activity. Thus, AGN193109, which binds to RARα, RARβ, and RARγ with Kd values = 2, 2, and 3 nM, respectively, but is unable to bind to the retinoid X receptors, is a highly active antagonist of retinoid action in ECE16-1 cells."

The decreased STAT3 mobility initially occurred by 2 min and was quantitative by 5 min. In addition, the change in STAT3 mobility was concentration-dependent and was detectable at 0.3 nM insulin with maximal effect between 1 and 3 nM. Although both these cell types also express the STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT5, and STAT6 isoforms, only STAT3 was observed to undergo an insulin-dependent reduction in mobility. Immunoprecipitation of STAT1 and STAT3 from 32P-labeled cells demonstrated that only STAT3 was phosphorylated in response to insulin whereas phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that this phosphorylation event occurred exclusively on serine residues. Furthermore, treatment of cell extracts with alkaline phosphatase reversed the insulin-stimulated decrease in STAT3 mobility. Together, these data demonstrate that insulin is a specific activator of STAT3 serine phosphorylation without affecting the other STAT isoforms.

Currently, there are six general members of this growing protein family (STAT1-6) with additional subtypes for several of these members(5.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L.

These proteins were first identified as Src Homology 2 (SH2) and Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of cytokine receptor signaling pathways(8.Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that activation of various cytokine receptors results in the stimulation of the Janus kinase family (JAK1, −2, and −3 and Tyk2) of protein tyrosine kinase(4.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The activated JAK kinases directly tyrosine phosphorylate the STAT proteins, which induce both hetero- and homodimerization through phosphotyrosine recognition by the STAT SH2 domains(9.Schindler C. Shuai K. Presioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 10.Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The STAT protein dimers then translocate into the nucleus and bind to specific DNA recognition sequences resulting in increased transcriptional activation of various effector genes(7.Schindler C.

However, since insulin does not stimulate the JAK kinases or increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT proteins, it is generally accepted that insulin does not impinge upon this particular signal transduction pathway(18.Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 24.Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, in contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation, recent studies have indicated that growth hormone, interferon α, and interleukin 6 can also stimulate the serine phosphorylation of the STAT proteins in a manner distinct from the JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation(11.Boulton T.G.

Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is required for maximal DNA transcriptional activity of reporter genes presumably through fostering STAT homodimerization(28.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, we have re-evaluated the potential role of insulin on STAT phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin stimulation results in a rapid quantitative serine phosphorylation of STAT3 without any significant effect on STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT5, or STAT6 phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMonoclonal antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal STAT1 and STAT3 antibodies for immunoprecipitation and Protein G Plus agarose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. [32P]Orthophosphate and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Corp. Dephosphorylation buffer was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma.Cell CultureChinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human insulin receptor (CHO/IR) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously(30.Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2791-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured in standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, and 10% calf serum). Adipocyte differentiation was induced 2 days postconfluence with differentiation medium (standard medium supplemented with 1.0 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μg/ml dexamethasone, and 27.8 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine). Following 4 days in differentiation medium, the dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine were removed by switching the cells to standard medium containing 1.0 μg/ml insulin. After an additional 4 days, the cells were changed back into standard medium and maintained for 1-7 days before use.Insulin StimulationCHO/IR and differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and incubated for 3-4 h in standard medium in the absence of serum. The cells were then treated with various concentrations of insulin (0-100 nM) and times (0-60 min) as indicated in the individual figure legends. Insulin stimulation was terminated by two washes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, removal of excess liquid by aspiration, and addition of liquid nitrogen to the tissue culture plates. The snap-frozen cells were placed at −80°C until harvested.Whole Cell Detergent LysatesCHO/IR and differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes were extracted in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, pH 7.8) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM leupeptin, and 1 μM pepstatin A by rotation for 10 min at 4°C. Insoluble material was separated from the soluble extract by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was determined, and the samples were either immunoprecipitated and/or directly subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis using a 32-cm long 7.5% acrylamide, 0.1% bisacrylamide running gel. The resolved proteins were then transferred to PVDF filter membranes and Western blotted using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system.Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisCHO/IR cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h in serum- and phosphate-free medium. The cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C with 6 mCi of 32PO4 (1.5 mCi/ml) and stimulated with and without 100 nM insulin for 5 min. The cells were rapidly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized on ice with 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 100 mM NaF, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM Na3VO4, 2 mM pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μM leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation, and the STAT proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using the polyclonal STAT1 and STAT3 antibodies. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to PVDF filter membranes, the samples were subjected to autoradiography for 1 h. The radiolabeled bands were excised and subjected to acid hydrolysis using 200 μl of 6 N HCl at 100°C for 1 h. The hydrolysates were collected, dried, and resuspended in 10 μl of water. The samples and phosphoamino acid standards were spotted on 100-mm cellulose plates and electrophoresed at 1000 V for 90 min in 0.87 M acetic acid, 0.5% (v/v) pyridine, 0.5 mM EDTA. The standards were visualized by ninhydrin staining and the radiolabeled phosphamino acids by autoradiography.Alkaline Phosphatase TreatmentCHO/IR cells unstimulated or stimulated with 100 nM insulin for 5 min were harvested in alkaline phosphatase lysis buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Insoluble material was removed by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4°C and assayed for protein content. Each alkaline phosphatase reaction contained 300 μg of cell lysate, 10 μl of 10 × dephosphorylation buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 μM leupeptin, and 1000 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Sigma), and the volume was increased to 100 μl with buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2). Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONInsulin Stimulation Results in a Reduction in STAT3 Electrophoretic MobilityPrevious studies have reported that although several growth factors can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins(12.Ruff-Jamison S.

Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 24.Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Schrader J.W. J. Biol.

However, recent studies have also demonstrated that STAT1α and STAT3 are also serine-phosphorylated, which appears to enhance their transcriptional activity in concert with tyrosine phosphorylation(29.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). To evaluate the potential role for insulin in mediating the serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins, CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes were incubated with and without insulin, and cell extracts were subjected to STAT Western blotting (Fig. 1). Using STAT isoform-specific antibodies both cell types were found to express STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6. In contrast, we were unable to detect any significant levels of STAT2 or STAT4 (data not shown). The absence of STAT4 is consistent with the observation of its limited tissue distribution with expression limited to the testis, thymus, and spleen (31.Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, the absence of STAT2 was somewhat surprising as it has been observed in several tissues and cultured cell lines(4.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, insulin stimulation had no effect on the apparent mobility of STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT5, and STAT6 (Fig. 1, A, C, and D). In contrast, insulin treatment for 5 min of either CHO/IR or 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in a marked reduction of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility of STAT3 (Fig. 1B). This insulin-stimulated decrease in STAT3 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility was a typical characteristic of post-translational serine/threonine phosphorylation similar to that observed for a number of intracellular signaling proteins including STAT3(32.Waters S.B. Holt K.H. Ross S.E. Syu L.-J. Guan K.-L. Saltiel A.R. Koretzky G.A. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

In both cell types, insulin stimulation for 2 min resulted in a small but detectable reduction in STAT3 mobility, which was fully shifted by 5 min (Fig. 2, A and B). The insulin-stimulated decreased mobility of STAT3 in CHO/IR cells was persistent for up to 60 min. In contrast, following 60 min of insulin stimulation in 3T3L1 adipocytes there was a partial recovery of STAT3 mobility back toward its basal state. This difference in kinetics probably reflects the greater amount of insulin receptors expressed in the CHO/IR cells compared with the endogenous levels in 3T3L1 adipocytes. In any case, the effect of insulin on STAT3 was quantitative since the entire immunoreactive population of STAT3 was gel shifted between 5 and 30 min. Similarly, stimulation of CHO/IR cells with 3 nM insulin was sufficient to induce a complete gel shift of STAT3 with the half-maximal response occurring at approximately 0.3 nM (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that the insulin-induced modification of STAT3 was a relatively rapid and sensitive event in both CHO/IR and 3T3L1 adipocytes.Figure 2:Time and concentration dependence of the insulin-stimulated decrease in STAT3 electrophoretic mobility. CHO/IR (A) or 3T3-L1 adipocytes (B) were incubated in the absence or the presence of 100 nM insulin for the times indicated at 37°C. Whole cell detergent extracts (150 μg) were prepared and subjected to Western blotting using a STAT3 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” CHO/IR cells (C) were incubated for 5 min at 37°C with various concentrations of insulin as indicated.

To determine the basis of the insulin-stimulated reduction in STAT3 mobility was, in fact, due to phosphorylation, we immunoprecipitated both STAT3 and STAT1 from 32P-labeled cells (Fig. 3A). In the absence of insulin, there was a relatively low level of STAT3 phosphorylation, which was markedly increased following 5 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, we were unable to detect any significant phosphorylation of STAT1 in either unstimulated or insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4). As controls for the immunoprecipitation, STAT1 and STAT3 were clearly immunoprecipitated by their respective antibodies, but only STAT3 displayed the characteristic insulin-stimulated reduction in mobility (Fig. 3A, lanes 5-8).Figure 3:Insulin stimulates the serine phosphorylation of STAT3. A, CHO/IR cells were labeled with 32P and incubated in the absence (C, lanes 1 and 3) or presence of 100 nM insulin (I, lanes 2 and 4) for 5 min at 37°C. Whole cell detergent extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated using the STAT3 antibody (lanes 1 and 2) or the STAT1 antibody (lanes 3 and 4) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The immunoprecipitates (IP) were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF filter membranes, and subjected to autoradiography.

Consistent with these data, we were unable to detect any tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (data not shown). Thus, we next performed phosphoamino acid analysis of STAT3 isolated from unstimulated and insulin-stimulated cells (Fig. 3B). These data directly demonstrate that insulin stimulates the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 without any significant tyrosine or threonine phosphorylation.Even though the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 correlated with its reduction of electrophoretic mobility, this does not prove cause and effect. Thus, to confirm that the serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was responsible for the reduction in mobility, extracts from unstimulated and insulin-stimulated cells were treated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 3C). As previously observed, STAT3 displayed the characteristic decreased mobility following insulin stimulation (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of extracts from unstimulated cells did not alter the mobility of STAT3 (Fig. 3C, lane 3). In contrast, alkaline phosphatase treatment of extracts from insulin-stimulated cells displayed an increase in mobility to the same extent as STAT3 from control cells (Fig. 3C, lane 4). These results demonstrate that the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was directly responsible for the reduction in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility.In summary, insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 is unique in several ways compared with other hormones that activate the STAT pathway. For example, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M, leukemia-inhibitory factor, interleukin 6, growth hormone, and interferon γ have all been found to induce both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT proteins(11.Boulton T.G.

However, the data presented in this study demonstrate that insulin is the only ligand to date that mediates the exclusive serine phosphorylation of a STAT protein. Although it has recently been suggested that both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation were due to a bifurcation of the JAK pathway (27.David M. Petricoin III, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), our data indicate the presence of at least two distinct tyrosine and serine kinase pathways. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the insulin-stimulated serine kinase pathway responsible for STAT protein phosphorylation was apparently specific for STAT3. This supports previous reports, which demonstrated that the interleukin-6 receptor selectively serine-phosphorylated STAT3 but not STAT1α(36.Lutticken C. Coffer P. Yuan J. Schwartz C. Caldenhoven E. Schindler C. Kruijer W. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Currently, the identification of the serine kinase and molecular pathways mediating these differences remains to be determined.

Currently, there are six general members of this growing protein family (STAT1-6) with additional subtypes for several of these members(5.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L.

These proteins were first identified as Src Homology 2 (SH2) and Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of cytokine receptor signaling pathways(8.Fu X.-Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that activation of various cytokine receptors results in the stimulation of the Janus kinase family (JAK1, −2, and −3 and Tyk2) of protein tyrosine kinase(4.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The activated JAK kinases directly tyrosine phosphorylate the STAT proteins, which induce both hetero- and homodimerization through phosphotyrosine recognition by the STAT SH2 domains(9.Schindler C. Shuai K. Presioso V.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 10.Qureshi S.A. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The STAT protein dimers then translocate into the nucleus and bind to specific DNA recognition sequences resulting in increased transcriptional activation of various effector genes(7.Schindler C.

However, since insulin does not stimulate the JAK kinases or increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT proteins, it is generally accepted that insulin does not impinge upon this particular signal transduction pathway(18.Silvennoinen O.

Nevertheless, in contrast to tyrosine phosphorylation, recent studies have indicated that growth hormone, interferon α, and interleukin 6 can also stimulate the serine phosphorylation of the STAT proteins in a manner distinct from the JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation(11.Boulton T.G.

Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 is required for maximal DNA transcriptional activity of reporter genes presumably through fostering STAT homodimerization(28.Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 29.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, we have re-evaluated the potential role of insulin on STAT phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that insulin stimulation results in a rapid quantitative serine phosphorylation of STAT3 without any significant effect on STAT1α, STAT1β, STAT5, or STAT6 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2142428209,"Signal transduction pathways involved in apoptotic cell death are poorly understood, although recent studies have implicated sphingomyelin hydrolysis and generation of the second messenger, ceramide. Previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that a serine protease termed AP24 was activated by TNF or UV light and induced DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei. This study extended these findings to examine the role of these enzymes in apoptosis of the U937 cell line and the mechanism of resistance of its variant, U9-TR. Although this subclone was selected by growth in TNF, it was unexpectedly found to resist apoptosis induced by UV light, but was still sensitive to anti-Fas-induced DNA fragmentation. Here we show that in contrast to normal U937 cells, UV light and TNF both failed to activate neutral or acidic sphingomyelinase or AP24 in the U9-TR variant. However, anti-Fas activated both neutral and acidic sphingomyelinase in the variant comparable to that seen in parental U937. The U9-TR variant could be sensitized to TNF or UV light activation of both sphingomyelinase and DNA fragmentation by the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. Furthermore, exogenous bacterial-derived sphingomyelinase caused U9-TR activation of AP24 and DNA fragmentation comparable to that in the parental U937. Exposure of permeabilized U937 cells to ceramide caused internucleosomal DNA cleavage that was blocked by an inhibitor of AP24. Taken altogether, these findings demonstrate that TNF or UV light activate sphingomyelinase that leads to the generation of ceramide resulting in activation of AP24 and DNA fragmentation in sensitive cells. A selective defect in signals leading to sphingomyelinase activation can confer resistance to apoptosis even though the variant is still sensitive to downstream apoptotic signals such as nuclear DNA fragmentation by activated exogenous AP24."

https://openalex.org/W1548142527,"The efficiency of ATP synthesis coupled to cell respiration, commonly referred to as the P/O ratio, has been the subject of extensive studies for more that 50 years. The general conclusion from these studies is that respiring mitochondria can convert external ADP to ATP at a maximal P/O ratio of 3 for NAD-linked substrates and 2 for succinate. However, in recent years the validity of these ""integral"" values has been questioned on both mechanistic and thermodynamic grounds, and a mechanistic P/O ratio of 2.5 for NAD-linked substrates and 1.5 for succinate have been concluded on the basis of experiments with isolated mitochondria. These values have been widely adopted in the scientific literature, including several recent textbooks. In this paper we report that under optimal conditions with respect to preparation and assay procedures, the P/O ratios obtained with isolated rat liver mitochondria consistently exceed 2.5 with NAD-linked substrates and 1.5 with succinate. These results, although not excluding ""nonintegral"" P/O ratios due to various energy-dissipating side reactions, warrant caution in accepting the reported lower values and, in general, in referring to mechanistic considerations unless the underlying molecular mechanisms are understood."

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has previously demonstrated that several residues in αH make important interactions with nucleic acid and influence frameshift fidelity. To define the role of αI (residues 278-286) during catalytic cycling, we performed systematic site-directed mutagenesis from position 277 through position 287 by changing each residue, one by one, to alanine. Each mutant protein was expressed and, except for L283A and T286A, was soluble. The soluble mutant enzymes were purified and characterized. In contrast to alanine mutants of αH, alanine substitution in αI did not have a significant effect on template•primer (T•P) binding as revealed by a lack of an effect on Km,T−P, Ki for 3′-azido-2′,3′-dideoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate, koff,T−P, and processivity. Consistent with these observations, the fidelity of the mutant enzymes was not influenced. However, alanine mutagenesis of αI lowered the apparent activity of every mutant relative to wild-type enzyme. Titration of two mutants exhibiting the lowest activity with T•P (L282A and R284A) demonstrated that these mutant enzymes could bind T•P stoichiometrically and tightly. In contrast, active site concentrations determined from “burst” experiments suggest that the lower activity is due to a smaller population of enzyme bound productively to T•P.

Reverse transcriptase is a heterodimer of 66- and 51-kDa polypeptides. The p51 subunit is a carboxyl-terminal truncation of the p66 subunit and although the amino-terminal sequence of p66 is identical to p51, the tertiary organization of the two subunits differ(4.Kohlstaedt L.A.

The carboxyl terminus of the p66 subunit has a fifth subdomain with RNase H activity that cleaves the RNA strand of hybrid duplex.

Crystallographic data suggest that two antiparallel α-helices in the thumb subdomain interact 3-5 (αH) and 6-9 (αI) nucleotides from the polymerase active site with the primer and template strands, respectively (Fig. 1). Within this region, the DNA is observed to be bent 40-45° and undergoes a transition from A- to B-form(3.Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G.

The primary sequence in the vicinity of these α-helices has been found to have sequence homology with several other nucleic acid polymerases and has been termed the “helix clamp”(6.Hermann T.

The periodicity of the effects observed suggest that a short segment of one face of αH (i.e. Gln258, Gly262, Trp266) interacts with the T•P. Kinetic parameters for T•P observed with the alanine mutants of Gly262 and Trp266 indicate that interactions in the minor groove of the duplex, several nucleotides from the primer-terminus, influence processivity and fidelity through T•P slippage(8.Bebenek K.

However, modeling longer stretches of nucleic acid into the binding cleft has suggested that residues of both αH and αI of the p51 thumb subdomain may also interact with nucleic acid (5.Nanni R.G.

Recent modeling of a RNA template•primer into the nucleic acid binding cleft has suggested that interactions may occur between the RNA primer strand and αI(6.Hermann T. Meier T. Götte M. Heumann H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primary sequence in the stretch of residues comprising αH and αI is highly basic (Lys259, Lys263, Lys275, Arg277, Lys281, Arg284, Lys287), and most of these residues are observed to be facing the DNA phosphate backbone (Fig. 1). To define the role of αI during catalytic cycling, we performed systematic site-directed mutagenesis from position 277 through 287 by changing each residue, one by one, to alanine.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The following mutations were introduced into M13-RT vector as described by Goel et al.(13.Goel R. Beard W.A. Kumar A.

The complete coding sequence of the RT gene was sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired substitution and the absence of any other change. Alanine mutants were purified as described previously(7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the purified mutant enzymes were assayed for exonuclease activity. Additional purification to separate p66 homodimer, p66/p51 heterodimer, and/or exonuclease contaminants was accomplished with a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column as described (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of contaminating 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity on a mismatched primer for each enzyme preparation was determined as described(14.Roberts J.D. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Enzyme preparations had at least 10-fold lower exonuclease activity than Klenow fragment. Enzyme activities were determined using a standard reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (22°C), 10 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM KCl. Other reaction conditions are described in the figure legends. Reactions were initiated by addition of enzyme (expressed as concentration of dimer), incubated at 22°C, and stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA, pH 8. Quenched reaction mixtures were spotted onto Whatman DE-81 filter disks and dried. Unincorporated [α-32P]dTTP was removed, and filters were counted as described(15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Ki for AZTTP, kcat, and substrate Michaelis constants were determined as described previously(7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition data were fitted by nonlinear least squares methods to, where kobs and kcat are v/[RT] and Vmax/[RT], respectively. kobs=[dTTP]kcatKm(1+[AZTTP]K1)+[dTTP](Eq. 1) Enzyme concentrations were determined from protein determinations (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) which had been calibrated by amino acid analysis. The dissociation rate constant (koff) for poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20 was determined as described(15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme was preincubated with T•P for 5 min before challenging free polymerase with heparin (zero time). At time intervals after adding challenge, 20-μl aliquots were removed and mixed with 20 μl of dTTP/Mg2+ to determine the concentration of RT remaining bound to T•P. After an additional 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped with EDTA. The final reaction conditions were 150 nM RT, 150 nM T•P (expressed as primer 3′ termini), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 30 μM [α-32P]dTTP, and 1 mg/ml heparin. Titration of enzyme with T•P (i.e. poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20) was performed as before(15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the concentration of RT bound to T•P, a 40-μl solution of 32 nM enzyme, expressed as concentration of dimer, was preincubated with varying concentrations of poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20. After 10 min, the reaction was initiated with 10 μl of 5 mg/ml heparin and 150 μM [α-32P]dTTP. After an additional 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of 0.5 M EDTA and the amount of incorporation was determined as above. Under these conditions, total incorporation is proportional to the concentration of RT-T•P complex. To determine the active site concentration of enzyme, synthesis was limited to a single deoxynucleotide by using a 47/24-mer heteropolymeric template•primer and including only the complementary dTTP to the first template base. The sequence of the primer and template were 5′-GCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTGTACGT-3′ and 3′-CGAACGTACGGACGTCCACATGCAATTGCCTAGGGGCCCATGGCTCG-5′, respectively. When product release is the rate-limiting step during catalytic cycling, then a burst of product formation is observed upon initiation of the reaction (Scheme I, k4 « k3). RT+T⋅Pk1⇄k−>1RTT⋅P+dNTPk2⇄k−2RTdNTPT⋅Pk3→RTT⋅P+1k4→RT+T⋅P+1SCHEME I The amount of product formed during the burst should be equivalent to the concentration of active enzyme and has been observed previously(17.Reardon J.E.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and 30-μl aliquots withdrawn at time intervals, stopped with EDTA, and incorporation determined by filter binding as described above. The final reaction conditions were 560 nM dimeric RT, 2 μM T•P (expressed as primer 3′ termini), 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 μM [α-32P]dTTP. The in vitro fidelity of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis was measured using a M13mp2 DNA substrate containing a 390-nucleotide single strand gap spanning the lacZα complementation gene target as described previously (21.Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis reactions (25 μl) contained 35 fmol of gapped M13mp2 DNA, 1-5 pmol of wild-type or mutant RT, 1 mM each of the four dNTPs in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Reactions were incubated at 37°C for 60 min and terminated by addition of EDTA. Complete gap-filling synthesis was confirmed by electrophoretic analysis of the products on a 0.8% agarose gel. Termination probability was analyzed using a primed single-stranded heteropolymeric M13mp2 DNA substrate as described previously(9.Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [γ-32P]ATP 5′-end-labeled primer used for this analysis was complementary to lacZ positions 105-120. Reactions conditions were the same as for the DNA synthesis reaction, except the DNA (160 fmol) was present in 3-fold molar excess over wild-type enzyme and 1-3-fold molar excess for the mutant derivatives. The 30-μl reactions were incubated at 37°C, and 10-μl aliquots were removed at 5, 15, and 30 min and stopped by adding to an equal volume of formamide dye solution (99% formamide, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Typically, less than 10% of the primer was extended ensuring single cycle processive DNA synthesis. Reinitiation of DNA synthesis on an extended primer was not observed as evidenced by the lack of an effect of the time of incubation on termination probability. Reaction products were analyzed by 16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the amount of radioactivity in the product bands was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). The termination probability for each position along the DNA template was calculated by dividing the number of product molecules of a given length by the sum of the number of product molecules of that length and the number of all longer products(9.Abbotts J. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10312-10323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A collection of expression constructs was prepared in which residues 277-287 of the RT gene were individually modified to alanine. This region includes αI of the thumb subdomain according to the structure of RT with bound DNA(3.Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Since alanine is indifferent to its location in α-helices(22.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Fasman G.D. Principles and Patterns of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York1990: 1-98Google Scholar), it serves as an ideal alternate residue to probe potential electrostatic and hydrophobic protein-DNA interactions. Each altered RT gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzymes were soluble in the crude cell extracts except for L283A and T286A. These two mutants were not characterized further. Following purification, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that the mutant RT polypeptides had the same apparent molecular weight as the wild-type polypeptide and were greater than 95% homogeneous (Fig. 2). The mutant p66 polypeptides represent, therefore, primarily homodimer preparations. Beard and Wilson (15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the RT homodimer is kinetically indistinguishable from the heterodimer and can serve as a useful model for examining altered forms of the enzyme. When the dissociation rate constant for T•P (k4) does not limit kcat, then for the model illustrated in, kcat and Km,dNTP are equivalent to k3 and Kd,dNTP. These kinetic parameters can, therefore, be estimated by measuring kcat and Km with dTTP and poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20. Fig. 3(left panel) illustrates the results of Km determinations for dTTP. Alanine mutants of αI were similar to alanine mutants of αH (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that the Km,dTTP was generally unchanged relative to wild-type enzyme. The lack of a significant effect on dNTP binding also suggests that the alanine substitution does not globally perturb the structure of the altered enzyme, since αI is distant from the putative dNTP binding site. Inhibition of dTTP incorporation with poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20 by AZTTP can be a sensitive assay to probe polymerase and dNTP, as well as template•primer interactions (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Jaju M. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9740-9747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since AZTTP is a substrate, the Ki determined when measuring the inhibition of dTTP incorporation is equivalent to the Km for AZTTP incorporation (Scheme I), where Km,AZTTP = Kd(k4/k3) (17.Reardon J.E. Miller W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20302-20307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ki for AZTTP inhibition is, therefore, sensitive to Kd for AZTTP, template•primer dissociation rate constant (k4), and rate constant for nucleotide incorporation (k3). In contrast to several alanine mutants of αH (cf. Fig. 5 of (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), alanine mutation of αI did not change the sensitivity of the mutants to AZTTP (Fig. 3, right panel). Because Ki,AZTTP is influenced by koff,T−P and kcat, as discussed above, these results suggest that T•P binding (i.e. k4), as well as catalytic activity (i.e. k3) should not be altered (see below). Although there are several potential electrostatic interactions between αI, of both the p51 and p66 subunits, and the sugar-phosphate backbone suggested by modeling studies(5.Nanni R.G. Ding J. Jacobo-Molina A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Perspect. Drug Discov. Des. 1993; 1: 129-150Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 6.Hermann T. Meier T. Götte M. Heumann H.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), individual removal of these basic side chains appears to have little influence on apparent DNA binding affinity as revealed from the sensitivity of the mutant enzymes to AZTTP. To determine if template• primer interactions had been perturbed, the Km for poly(rA)• oligo(dT)20 was determined. Consistent with the lack of an effect on sensitivity to AZTTP, alanine mutation of αI did not significantly alter the Km,T·P (Fig. 4, left panel). There was less than a 2-fold increase in Km,T·P for only one mutant of αI (Q278A), and two mutants (C280A and K281A) exhibited a 5-6-fold lower Km,T·P. Because binding of poly(rA)•oligo(dT)20 is very tight, it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the Km,T·P when the enzyme concentration is approximately equivalent to Km. Consequently, these small changes probably are not significant. In contrast to the small changes observed with the alanine mutants of αI, several alanine mutants of αH (Q258A, G262A, W266A) resulted in large increases in the Km,T·P (cf. Fig. 6 of (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol.

DNA is in excess severalfold over enzyme to limit synthesis on a primer to a single cycle. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, quantified by phosphorimagery, and termination probability at each site expressed in percent, as the ratio of products at a site to the products at that site plus all greater length products. Termination results from a kinetic competition between further extension, k3, and dissociation of the enzyme from DNA, k4 (see).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly assess whether αI interacts with nucleic acid, the dissociation rate constant for the RT-T•P complex (k4 or k−1 in Scheme I) was measured. As demonstrated with αH(7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dissociation rate constant for the RT-T•P complex is a sensitive index of the nature of the interactions between RT and T•P. The dissociation of the RT-T•P complex can be monitored by challenging the complex with heparin, to trap RT dissociating from T•P, and then assaying for the concentration of complex remaining after increasing periods of challenge(15.Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9745-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate constant for T•P with several alanine mutants of αI was increased modestly for several alanine mutants, but the increase was less than 4-fold when compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4, right panel). The increase in koff,T−P was generally observed when a basic side chain was replaced with alanine. T•P bound much weaker to G262A and W266A of αH relative to wild-type enzyme, as monitored by the dissociation rate constant for T•P (cf. Fig. 7 of (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Whereas the activity (i.e. kcat) of the alanine mutants of αH were influenced differentially (cf. Fig. 3 of (7.Beard W.A. Stahl S.J. Kim H.-R. Bebenek K. Kumar A. Strub M.-P. Becerra S.P. Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28091-28097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the apparent activity of every mutant of αI was diminished, in one case 150-fold (L282A), relative to wild-type enzyme (Fig. 5). As noted above, this was unexpected since the Ki,AZTTP (Fig. 3, right panel) for these mutants was not affected by the alanine substitution. Since processivity is determined by kinetic competition between further extension (k3) and dissociation of the enzyme from nucleic acid (k4), termination probability is a measure of the ratio of these rate constants. The processivity of the alanine mutants of αI was measured on M13mp2 DNA primed with a 32P-5′-end-labeled 15-mer primer(8.Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.-R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H.

https://openalex.org/W1946234283,"Cardiac inward rectifiers may have a three-barrel channel structure, based on evidence for three substates in single-channel recordings. However, some reports indicate four substates, a feature more compatible with the four-subunit structure for which there is evidence in cloned voltage-activated K+ channels. Here we show that although the fourth is easily missed, inward rectifier channels have four substates whose expression is controlled by intracellular Ca(2+) ions. Fourth substate openings also appear after rectification loss in intracellular divalent caution-free solution. We find that this process is accelerated by cytochalasin, a microfilament disrupter. Cytochalasin also abolishes Ca(2+), but not Mg(2+),-induced rectification by restoring fourth substate openings. Thus, cytoskeletal elements control Ca(2+)-dependent substate expression and rectification in native inwardly rectifying K+ channels."

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). While much attention has been given to the post-translational regulation of CDK2, we and others have found that CDK2 is also regulated at the transcriptional level. Horiguchi-Yamada et al.(11.Horiguchi-Yamada J. Yamada H. Nakada S. Ochi K. Nemoto T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 132: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) reported a 3-fold increase in CDK2 mRNA in HL60 cells following stimulation with the phorbol ester 12-o-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate. Other groups (12.Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) had similar findings with serum-stimulated human keratinocytes and human lung fibroblasts. Tanguay et al.(13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) found induction of CDK2 expression in primary B lymphocytes following anti-IgM stimulation. These data suggest that transcriptional regulation of CDK2 could be important in the transition of cells from G1 to S phase. Our interest in CDK2 transcriptional regulation originated from our observation that CDK2 protein is undetectable by immunohistochemistry in sections of normal rat carotid arteries but is rapidly induced in smooth muscle cells of rat carotid arteries after balloon injury(14.Schieffer E. Chronos N.A.F. Robinson K.A. Milner P.G. Rowe M. Shiffman D. King III, S.B. Restenosis Summit VII. Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH1995: 23Google Scholar). This manuscript reports the cloning of the human genomic DNA upstream of the coding region of CDK2. Most (70%) of the basal transcriptional activity of this promoter was localized to a 210-base pair (bp) fragment. Two Sp1 sites in this region were shown to contribute cooperatively to this transcriptional activity. The serum-induced activity of the promoter is located in a ∼1.7-kilobase pairs (kb) region starting 680 bp upstream of the most proximal transcription initiation site. pGL2-Basic (Promega) was used to generate luciferase reporter gene constructs. pCMV/SEAP (Tropix), which contains the secreted alkalaine phosphatase (SEAP) gene driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, was used in cotransfection experiments. pBR-β-Puromycin, a plasmid expressing the puromycin resistance gene driven by the β-actin promoter, was a kind gift of L. Lee of the S. N. Cohen Lab (Stanford University) and was used to generate stably transfected cell lines by cotransfection. DSC34 was generated by cloning a ∼2.4-kb AvrII-PstI fragment (Fig. 1, fragment B) from inverse PCR-amplified fragment A into pUC19 (New England Biolabs) digested with PstI and XbaI. DSC36 was generated by cloning a blunt-ended ∼2.4-kb PstI-Asp718 fragment of DSC34 into HindIII-digested, blunt-ended pGL2-Basic, such that the CDK2 promoter directs transcr iption away from the luciferase gene. DSC37 was constructed the same way as DSC36, except that the CDK2 promoter directs transcription toward the luciferase gene. DSC40 was generated from DSC37 by deleting from the BamHI site in the insert to a BglII site in the poly-cloning region of pGL2-Basic. DSC40Δ4-1, DSC40Δ6-3, DSC40Δ9-17, DSC40Δ10-10, and DSC40Δ10-16 were generated by exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease deletions (15.Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) using NheI/SacI-digested DSC40. The end points of the deletions were determined by sequencing. DSC42 was generated from DSC37 by deletion of a BglII-Eco47III fragment. DSC51 was generated from DSC40 by deleting an Eco47III-Bsp120I fragment. DSC67 and DSC68 were generated from DSC40Δ9-17 by site-directed mutagenesis (see below). The positions of the 5′-end of all primers are given in numbers corresponding to the published cDNA sequence(16.Tsai L.H. Harlow E. Meyerson M. Nature. 1991; 353: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Inverse PCR (17.Ochman H. Ajoika J.W. Graza D. Hartl D.L. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplifications.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2216-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). For intron exon mapping, the following pairs of primers were used: introns I and II, 5′- GCCAGAAACAAGTTGACG-3′ (231, sense) and 5′-GATGAGGGGAAGAGGAATG-3′ (481, antisense); intron III, 5′-CTGCTGGATGTCATTCAC-3′ (365, sense) and 5′-AGTACGAACAGGGACTCC-3′ (644, antisense); introns IV and V, 5-CTAGCTTTCTGCCATTCT-3′ (513, sense) and 5′-GGAAGAGCTGGTCAATCT-3′ (810, antisense); intron VI, 5′-CCTATTCCCTGGAGATTC- 3′ (772, sense), 5′-GAGAGGGTGAGATTAGGG-3′ (1106, antisense), and 5′-GTGGTGGAGGCTAACTTA-3′ (1295, antisense). PCR and reverse transcription-PCR were carried out using Perkin Elmer kits. The 250-bp Eco47III-PstI fragment from DSC34 was cloned into pT7T318U (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) digested with HincII and PstI. The resulting plasmid was linearized with EcoRI and transcribed in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]ATP to generate an antisense probe. Ribonuclease protection was performed as described (19.Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., Struhl, K. (eds) (1994) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current ProtocolsGoogle Scholar) using RNA isolated from human umbilical vein cells (ATCC), according to Chirgwin et al.(20.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). Yeast RNA (Sigma) was used as a negative control. The size of the protected products was determined from a sequencing ladder run alongside the samples. Protection assays were carried out as described(21.Shiffman D. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6767-6774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using purified Sp1 protein (Promega). An XmaI fragment from DSC40 (for Fig. 5, panel A) and a Bsp120I fragment from DSC68 and DSC69 (for Fig. 5, panels B and C) were radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. These labeled fragments were digested with PvuII (for a fragment derived from DSC40) or BglI (for fragments derived from DSC68 or DSC69) to obtain fragments exclusively labeled at the 5′-end of the bottom strand. A primer (5′-CCGGGTCGGGATGGAACG-3′) starting at the 5′-end of the XmaI fragment was used to generate a parallel sequencing ladder. DSC40Δ9-17 was mutagenized using the U. S. E. Mutagenesis Kit from Pharmacia with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TTTCCCTGGCTCCGAACCAGGC-3′ and 5′-CACCAGAGGCCCCGAACTGCTTCCCGCGTTT-3′, which are the Sp1 mutagenic oligonucleotides, and 5′-CATCGGTCGATGGATCCAGAC-3′, which was used to mutate the SalI site in the vector (mutated nucleotides are underlined). The SalI site change was used to enrich and screen for mutated plasmids. Mutagenesis was verified by sequence analysis. All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., except where indicated. NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For serum stimulation experiments, cells were serum starved by growing them for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 0.5% calf serum. Cells were stimulated with growth medium containing 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor and 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. For transient assays 1.5 μg of the luciferase-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of pCMV/SEAP. Conditioned media were collected 24 h after transfection and assayed for SEAP using the Phospha-Light kit (Tropix). Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Transient transfections were repeated at least two independent times in duplicates. Stable cell lines were generated by cotransfecting 1.8 μg of a luciferase-expressing construct and 0.2 μg of pBR-β-Puromycin, a plasmid expressing the puromycin resistance gene. Resistant cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml, Sigma) 24 h after transfection. After 5-10 days of selection, single resistant colonies were isolated and expanded. Inverse PCR (17.Ochman H. Ajoika J.W. Graza D. Hartl D.L. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplifications. Stockton Press, New York1989: 105-111Crossref Google Scholar) was employed to clone a 4.2-kb genomic DNA fragment upstream of the known cDNA sequence corresponding to a BglII-BclI fragment (Fig. 1, fragment A). Sequence analysis revealed that this fragment contains an intron, located just upstream of the first BglII site in the coding region. A 2.4-kb AvrII-PstI subclone (fragment B), containing only exon sequences upstream of the translational start site, was used for subsequent transcription analyses. The cloned inverse PCR product was shown to be part of the CDK2 gene by identifying the sequence junction of the published CDK2 cDNA and the upstream sequence. In addition, in situ hybridization (data not shown) mapped the cloned CDK2 upstream sequence to the chromosomal locus 12q13, corresponding to a previously published report(22.Demetrick D.J. Zhang H. Beach D.H. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 1994; 66: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence 1.1 kb upstream of the ATG translation initiation codon was determined from both strands as shown in Fig. 2. To determine the transcription start site, a ribonuclease protection assay was performed using RNA isolated from human umbilical vein cells and an in vitro transcribed RNA probe extending from the PstI site just upstream of the translation initiation codon to the Eco47III site 250 bp upstream (Fig. 3). Five transcription start sites were identified. The most downstream site was designated as nucleotide +1 in Fig. 2. Three transcription start sites are clustered at positions +1, −5, and −9. Two additional sites are located at positions −33 and −71. The −33 site maps close to the 5′-end of the longest published human CDK2 cDNA(23.Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nomoto S. Yasuda H. Reed S.I. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which was isolated from HeLa cells, whereas the −9 start site maps close to the 5′-end of a different cDNA clone (15.Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar) that was also isolated from HeLa cells. No consensus TATA box was identified upstream to any of the transcription start sites nor was one identified anywhere else in the sequenced upstream region. Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified using manual scanning and the TFD data base (24.Ghosh D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3117-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in conjunction with the MacPattern program (25.Fuchs R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 171-178PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). Two consensus Sp1 elements were found to lie in proximity to the two upstream transcription start sites. Sp1 is known to guide initiation in some TATA-less promoters(26.Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar), and so we hypothesized that these elements might be functionally important in the human CDK2 gene. A binding site for YY1, another factor also known to determine the sites of initiation in some TATA-less promoters(26.Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar), was also identified upstream of the three transcription start sites clustered at positions +1, −5, and −9. Other putative transcription factor binding sites identified in the upstream region of the human CDK2 gene include multiple AP-2, E2F, and p53 binding sites as well as single sites for AP-1, c-myb, oct, HiNF-A, and NFY/CTF, a CCAAT box binding factor.Figure 3:Mapping of the human CDK2 transcription initiation site.

Protected fragments and their sizes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The CDK2 promoter region was analyzed by transient transfection of luciferase reporter gene constructs into NIH3T3 cells. Luciferase activity was corrected for differences in transfection efficiency by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing the SEAP gene driven by the CMV promoter (see “Materials and Methods”). Deletion analysis of the CDK2 promoter (Fig. 4) revealed that a 210-bp fragment containing 100 bp upstream of the most proximal transcription start site (DSC40Δ9-17) contains the required elements for approximately 70% of the promoter activity that is generated by a full-length construct (DSC37). A further deletion to nucleotide −15 (DSC40Δ10-10) reduced the activity to less than 3% of that generated by the full-length construct (DSC37). This activity was similar to the background activity generated by the vector alone (pGL2-Basic). An internal deletion that removes all the transcriptional start sites (DSC51) also had no promoter activity above background as did a reporter construct containing the full-length sequence in the reverse orientation (DSC36). DNase I protection analysis of the region contained in DSC40 using HeLa nuclear extracts identified two protected regions, each of which contained Sp1-like binding sequences (data not shown). To test the importance of these Sp1 sites, a conserved GG sequence in each of the Sp1 sites was independently mutated to AA. A DNase I protection assay (Fig. 5A) demonstrated that the wild type DNA fragment was protected by purified Sp1 protein from DNase I digestion at two distinct regions (I and II); these regions were the same as those detected with HeLa nuclear extract. Mutating each of these Sp1 sites individually resulted in loss of protection in the mutated Sp1 site but did not affect Sp1 binding to the remaining wild type Sp1 site (Fig. 5, B and C). Transient transfection of NIH3T3 cells with constructs analogous to DSC40Δ9-17, except containing mutations in either one of the Sp1 sites (Fig. 6, DSC67 and DSC68), generated luciferase activity that was less than 25% of the activity generated by the full-length CDK2 promoter construct (DSC37), or approximately 30% of that generated by DSC40Δ9-17. These results indicate that each of these Sp1 sites contributes to the observed transcription activity. Moreover, it also suggests that these sites act synergistically to generate transcriptional activity that is greater than the sum of activities each site can generate by itself. To analyze the serum inducibility of the cloned CDK2 promoter region, stably transfected NIH3T3 cell lines expressing luciferase from CDK2 promoter deletion derivatives were established. Cells were serum starved for 72 h prior to being exposed to serum and growth factors (Fig. 7). Luciferase activity increased 3-fold 12 h after serum stimulation of cells stably expressing the full-length construct (DSC37). In contrast, no induction by serum was observed with cells stably expressing DSC40, which exhibits full basal activity, but is about 1.7 kb shorter than DSC37. The same results were obtained with two independently isolated cell lines stably expressing the same constructs (data not shown). PCR amplifications with pairs of primers that overlap most of the published human CDK2 cDNA sequence were used to determine the intron/exon junctions of this gene. Human genomic DNA and total human RNA were used as amplification substrates. Fragments from DNA amplification that were larger than the respective fragments amplified from RNA were cloned. Each cloned fragment was sequenced from both ends until an exon/intron boundary was reached. Seven exons were identified, and their positions are indicated in Fig. 8. In this study, we have cloned and sequenced the upstream region of the human CDK2 gene and determined the transcription start sites for this gene by ribonuclease protection assay. Five transcription start sites spread over a 72-bp region were identified (Fig. 3). No consensus TATA box was identified in the entire upstream sequence. Thus, this promoter falls into the category of TATA-less promoters similar to all other cell cycle genes analyzed to date including: cdc2(27.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), cyclin A(28.Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), cyclin D1(29.Herber B. Truss M. Beato M. Muller R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2105-2107PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Muller H. Lukas J.

Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), as well as Xenopus laevis cdk2(32.Olive M. Theze N. Philippe M. Le Pennec J.P. Lerivray H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A YY1 box, which in some TATA-less promoters is responsible for determining the transcription start site(26.Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar), is present just upstream from the three start sites located at positions +1, −5, and −9. An Sp1 site was identified upstream of each of the remaining transcription start sites (−33 and −71), suggesting that these Sp1 regions may be responsible for localizing the start of transcription at these sites (26.Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). Other putative transcription factor binding sites were also identified (Fig. 2). The presence of a c-Myb binding site is intriguing since c-myb was shown to transactivate the closely related human CDC2 gene(33.Ku D.H. Wen S.C. Engelhard A. Nicolaides N.C. Lipson K.E. Marino T.A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2255-2259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could indicate that a transcription factor that positively regulates a G2 event, like CDC2 induction, might also regulate a G1 event such as CDK2 induction. Two putative p53 binding sites were identified within 200 bp of the 3′ or most proximal transcription start site. p53 is a known tumor suppressor gene that has been postulated to be involved in induction of cell cycle arrest. It is perplexing to assume that p53 would induce CDK2 since this induction would most likely result in an accelerated cell cycle rather than a cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, a p53 site was also identified in the promoter region of the cyclin A gene, a regulatory partner of CDK2(28.Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the possible involvement of p53 in CDK2 regulation is required. Functional analysis of the promoter region revealed that a construct (DSC40Δ9-17) that contains DNA extending from nucleotide −100 to +108 is sufficient for strong basal promoter activity (about 30% of the SV40 early promoter, data not shown). DNase I footprint analysis of the CDK2 upstream region with HeLa nuclear extract (data not shown) revealed only two protected regions, both of which are Sp1 like sites, contained within the DSC40Δ9-17 clone. Further analysis indicated that these sites in fact bind purified Sp1 protein (Fig. 5). Furthermore, individually mutating each site abolished the DNase I protection only in the mutated site but not in the adjacent wild type site. This information indicates that Sp1 can bind to each of these sites in an independent fashion. The transcriptional activity of reporter gene constructs equivalent to DSC40Δ9-17, but with individually mutated Sp1 sites (Fig. 6, DSC67 and DSC68), was less than 25% of the activity generated by the full-length CDK2 promoter construct (DSC37) and approximately 30% of that generated by DSC40Δ9-17. This suggests that each of these Sp1 sites contributes to the basal activity of the CDK2 promoter. It also suggests that their combined effect is synergistic, since both sites generate transcriptional activity that is greater than the sum of the activities generated by each site independently. The level of CDK2 mRNA induction following stimulation of quiescent cells was reported to be 2-3-fold(11.Horiguchi-Yamada J. Yamada H. Nakada S. Ochi K. Nemoto T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 132: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12.Geng Y. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10315-10319Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13.Tanguay D.A. Chiles T.C. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our attempts to detect this low level of serum-induced promoter activity using a transient transfection cell culture system produced ambiguous results, presumably because there is plasmid loss over time, and this loss masks the serum-induced promoter activity of the retained plasmids. To overcome this problem, NIH3T3 cell lines stably expressing the luciferase enzyme driven by various CDK2 promoter constructs were established. The basal luciferase activity of the cell lines in this study was comparable; however, only cells which contained about 2.4 kb of the upstream region of the CDK2 gene (DSC37) were induced by serum. The level of induction following serum starvation and maximal growth factor stimulation was about 3-fold, as was expected from the published literature and our own unpublished observations. The next longest deletion derivative, DSC40, which expressed full basal promoter activity in a transient transfection assay, was not induced by serum and growth factor stimulation. These data suggest that the information needed for serum induction resides in a ∼1.7-kb segment, which starts 682 nucleotides upstream of the most proximal transcription start site. We found that the human CDK2 gene is made up of at least seven exons. However, our characterization would not detect exons located 3′ to position 1295 in the published cDNA sequence(15.Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2832) Google Scholar). All the intervening sequences that were identified are contained within the coding region of the gene. Exon I is longer in CDK2 than in the characterized CDC2 genes (27.Dalton S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 34.Hindley J. Phear G.A. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 31: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and is conserved in X. laevis cdk2(32.Olive M. Theze N. Philippe M. Le Pennec J.P. Lerivray H. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Other differences between the CDK2 and the CDC 2 gene structure include two additional introns located at amino acids 105 and 196 of the human CDK2 gene that are not present in the Sacchromyces pombe CDC2 gene. The CDK2 gene structure and sequence information published here may be useful for designing primers to investigate possible CDK2 gene mutations and rearrangements. Although CDK2 has not been implicated in oncogenic transformation, one of its regulatory partners, cyclin A, has been implicated in human hepatocellular carcinoma(35.Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Brechot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), and its other regulatory partner, cyclin E, has been shown to accelerate G1 progression if overexpressed(36.Resnitzky D. Gossen M. Bujard H. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1669-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). It is thus plausible to assume that CDK2 mutations might play a role in malignancy and may prove worthwhile targets for exploration of genetic instability in tumors. In summary, the elements required for basal expression and serum induction of the human CDK2 promoter were localized to a ∼2.4-kb fragment. Basal level expression of the CDK2 promoter is fully contained within 290 bp upstream of the most proximal transcription start site (DSC40Δ6-3), and approximately 70% of the activity can be generated by a 200-bp fragment containing only 100 bp upstream of the most proximal transcription start site. Two Sp1 DNA binding sites identified in this region synergistically contribute most of the basal promoter activity of this region. The elements required for serum inducibility lie about 700 bp further upstream and are contained in a ∼1.7-kb fragment. Multiple sites with homology to known transcription factor binding sites are located in the promoter region of the human CDK2 gene. Further analysis of these sites and their corresponding transcription factors is necessary for a more complete understanding of the transcriptional regulation of this gene. We thank H. Donis-Keller and R. Veile for in situ hybridization data and R. M. Lawn for helpful discussions and suggestions."

Presently accepted examples of T cell-mediated autoimmune disease are diabetes mellitus type I and multiple sclerosis. On the other hand, autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor are responsible for myasthenia gravis and autoantibodies to the thyrotrophin receptor cause the hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease.The most common organ-specific autoimmune disease in humans is Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

These recombinant IgG class Fabs have a high affinity (Kd ∼ 10−10 M) for TPO and recognize overlapping conformational epitopes in a restricted region of the molecule(5.Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S.

Furthermore, the TPO Fabs compete for binding to TPO by >80% of autoantibodies in serum from most patients and, consequently, they define a TPO immunodominant region(3.Portolano S. Chazenbalk G.D. Seto P. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5.Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S. Russo D. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B.

Invest. 1993; 92: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), interacts with the B2 domain in the immunodominant region. Like other IgG class autoantibodies, TR1.9 binds specifically to its antigen and it is encoded by genes which appear to be somatically mutated from the germline (reviewed in (10.Rapoport B. Portolano S. McLachlan S.M. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)). In contrast, IgM class autoantibodies are frequently polyreactive and may be derived from unmutated or only slightly mutated germline genes (see for example, (11.Pascual V. Victor K. Rander I. Natvig J.B. Capra J.D. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 50-53Google Scholar)).Information on the three-dimensional structure of human TPO-specific Fab and, ultimately, the Fab-TPO complex will provide insight into TPO recognition by the immune system. In this report, we present the crystallographic analysis, at 2.0-Å resolution, for TPO-specific Fab TR1.9. Of the limited number of human antibodies for which crystal structures have been determined(12.Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), none are autoantibodies. The present data, therefore, present the first structural analysis of a human, IgG class, disease-associated autoantibody.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of TPO-specific Fab TR1.9To permit higher levels of expression, the heavy and light chain genes for TR1.9 in the Immunozap vector (5.Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S. Russo D. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were subcloned in the XhoI and XbaI sites of pBP101(13.Posner B. Lee I. Itoh T. Pyati J. Graff R. Thorton G.B. La Polla R. Benkovic S.J. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. B. Posner, Pennsylvania State University. Expression of TR1.9 was performed as described (13.Posner B. Lee I. Itoh T. Pyati J. Graff R. Thorton G.B. La Polla R. Benkovic S.J. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 128: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, BL21 cells bearing the pTG119 and the pBP101 plasmids were grown at 37°C in Luria Bertani medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 10 μg/ml tetracycline (both from Sigma) until the optical density of the cells reached 0.8 (600 nm). Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-thio-D-1-galactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h at 37°C. Cells were pelleted and processed as described previously(3.Portolano S. Chazenbalk G.D. Seto P. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TR1.9 Fab was affinity-purified using goat anti-human IgG-coupled Sepharose beads (ZYMED Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). After elution with glycine buffer, pH 2.5, samples were immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 7.4, and the buffer was then exchanged to 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4.CrystallizationCrystals of TR1.9 Fab were obtained by a sparse matrix screening procedure (14.Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) using Crystal Screen (Hampton Research, Laguna Hills, CA). Crystals grew from drops suspended over wells containing 1 ml of 8% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with the drops containing 2 μl of protein (10 mg/ml in 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.02% sodium azide) and 2 μl of well solution. The crystals exhibit the symmetry of space group P21, with cell constants: a = 50.93, b = 62.78, c = 84.79 Å, and β = 107.2 degrees.Crystallographic Data Collection and ProcessingX-ray intensity data were collected on an R-AXIS II system using graphite-monochromatized CuKα radiation from a Rigaku RU200 rotating-anode generator. All the data used in the analysis were obtained from one crystal of approximate size, 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.3-mm3, at room temperature. The data were processed using the program XDS(15.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). Statistics for the intensity data are given in Table 1. Data completeness at various resolutions and F/σ (F) levels are presented in Fig. 1. The average redundancy of the data was 3.5 and the Rsym on intensities was 8.4%.Tabled 1Figure 1:Data completeness plotted against resolution for all non-zero reflections and for those with F ≥ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 σ (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Crystal Structure DeterminationThe crystal structure was determined by Molecular Replacement using the program AMoRe(16.Navaza J. Acta Cryst. 1994; A50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar). The Fab fragment of antibody 3D6 (17.He X.M. Rueker F. Casale E. Carter D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7154-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (available from the Protein Data Bank (18.Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer Jr, E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R.

The 95% most intense reflections in the resolution range 8-4 Å were used in the analysis. The results of the rotation and translation searches are summarized in Table 2. Since space group P21 has an undefined origin along y, a relative translation search was performed between the two probe modules. After rigid-body refinement, the correlation coefficient between calculated and observed structure factors was 0.465 and the crystallographic residual, the R-value, was 40.6%. The packing of the molecules in the crystal was very reasonable. The α-carbons at the end of VL and at the beginning of CL were 7.2 Å apart, while those at the end of VH and at the beginning of CH1 were 7.3 Å apart, demonstrating that Molecular Replacement had positioned the two modules properly relative to each other. As a test, a composite model including all four domains was used as the probe in another search with AMoRe. The results (see Table 2) were again unambiguous, with a correlation coefficient of 0.448 and an R-value of 40.7%. There is one Fab in the asymmetric unit.Tabled 1Structure RefinementAll subsequent refinement was done using X-PLOR(20.Bruenger A.T. X-PLOR: A System For Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). Another rigid-body refinement, using data for which F ≥ 3 σ (F) in the 10-4.0-Å resolution range and allowing the four domains of the Fab to move independently of each other yielded an R-value of 39.0%. At this point, 3D6 residues were replaced with alanines at the 20 positions in VL and the 67 in VH where 3D6 and TR1.9 differ in sequence (or with glycines where TR1.9 has this residue) (Table 3). In addition, the 3D6 residues 91-96 (in CDR3-L) in the light chain and residues 96-100 (in CDR3-H) in the heavy chain (following the numbering convention of Kabat et al.(21.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, 1991Google Scholar)) were excised, since 3D6 and TR1.9 differ in the number of amino acids in these two CDRs. The valine at position 225 in CH1 was replaced by the germline alanine (Kabat et al.(21.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed. United States Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, 1991Google Scholar). The R-value was 41.6% for this mutated molecule with data in the resolution range 10-2.2 Å with F ≥ 3 σ (F) (16,475 reflections).Tabled 1A 2Fo - Fc map was computed and displayed with the mutated molecule using the graphics program FRODO (22.Jones A.T. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The fit of model to map was very good. There was density for most of the omitted side chains and for the excised CDR3-L and CDR3-H segments (Fig. 2). The omitted side chains were manually built into the structure on the basis of the map, as well as the excised regions. Adjustments were made in the NH2 and COOH termini, in the switch regions, as well as in several loops. After the first rebuilding, the R-value was reduced to 37.4%. A second round of model rebuilding based on a 2Fo - Fc map further reduced the R-value to 34.8%. A third round of rebuilding only reduced the R-value to 34.6% and manual rebuilding was discontinued for the time being.Figure 2:Stereodrawing of a portion of the 2Fo - Fc map of TR1.9 Fab after rigid-body refinement, with the CDR3-L loop from the final model overlaid. Although residues 91-96 had not been included in the structure factor calculation, the map has continuous electron density corresponding to those residues. The contour level is 1.0 σ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The structure was then refined using X-PLOR with data for which F ≥ 2 σ (F) in the resolution range 10-2.2 Å (17,852 reflections). One run of simulated annealing reduced the R-value to 25.3% and four cycles of alternating thermal factor (B-factor) and positional refinement further reduced the R-value to 20.7%. The R-value for the 2,422 reflections between 2.2- and 2.0-Å spacings and which had not been included in the refinement up to this point was 30.7%.Another round of model rebuilding using FRODO was performed based on 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps. The maps clearly showed that the residue at heavy chain position 225 is not an alanine, as had been assumed on the basis of the germline sequence. The electron density was consistent with a valine, as in antibody 3D6, and the appropriate change was made. Furthermore, putative solvent (water) molecules were identified.From this point onward, all the data in the resolution range 10-2.0 Å, for which F ≥ 2 σ (F) (20,274 reflections), were included in the refinement (R-value = 23.5%). Three more cycles of alternating B-factor and positional refinement reduced the R-value to 18.0%.The average B-factor is 30.9 Å squared (r.m.s.d. = 16.7) for the 439 α-carbons, 31.1 (r.m.s.d. = 16.6) for the 1756 main chain atoms, and 31.7 (r.m.s.d. = 17.2) for all atoms in the protein. Five solvent molecules, for which the B-factor was greater than the average for main chain atoms plus 3 standard deviations (80.9 Å squared), were discarded. Four protein segments have B-factors greater than this value: the last three residues in both light and heavy chains, the first two residues in the heavy chain, and the segment 135-142 in the heavy chain. These segments are represented by very weak electron density and could not be positioned with confidence. A plot of the B-factors is presented in Fig. 3.Figure 3:B-factor plots for the two chains in TR1.9 Fab: solid, main chain; dotted, side chain (zero side chain values correspond to glycines). The residue numbers are sequential.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The final model has 3318 protein atoms comprising 214 amino acids in the light and 225 amino acids in the heavy chain, plus 216 water molecules. The root mean square deviation from ideality is 0.016 Å for bond lengths, and 3.5 and 1.4 degrees for bond and dihedral angles, respectively. Four non-glycine residues have ϕψ values which lie just outside allowed regions(23.Sasisekharan V. Ramanathan N. Collagen. John Wiley, New York1962: 39-77Google Scholar) : Ser30 and Ala51 in the light chain and Val2 and Thr133 in the heavy chain (numbering convention of Kabat et al.(21.Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 5th Ed.

The average error in atomic positions, calculated according to the method of Luzzati(24.Luzzati V. Acta Cryst. 1953; 6: 142-152Crossref Google Scholar), is 0.26 Å. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (entry codes 1VGE and R1VGESF).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDescription of the StructureA ribbon diagram of TR1.9 Fab is presented in Fig. 4. As in other Fabs, the homologous domains of TR1.9 Fab are related by pseudodyads: 174.0 degrees between VL and VH, and 168.5 degrees between CL and CH1. The elbow bend of TR1.9 Fab is 134.1 degrees. These values are within the range observed for other Fabs (see Refs. 12, 25, and 26) and, in fact, are very nearly the same as those observed for Hil, 2F. A. Saul and R. J. Poljak, see Protein Data Bank entry 8FAB, unpublished results. a human IgG1, λ myeloma protein (PDB entry 8FAB, second Fab in the entry).Figure 4:Ribbon drawing of TR1.9 Fab showing the light chain on the left and the heavy chain (darker) on the right. The variable domains are at the top and the constant domains of the Fab are at the bottom. The molecular surface, shown as dots, covering the CDR residues was computed using program MS of Connolly (25.Davies D.R. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Silverton E.W. Cohen G.H. Smith-Gill S.J.

Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar); a probe radius of 1.7 Å was used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The molecular surface (27.Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar) that covers the CDRs of TR1.9 is included in Fig. 4. The CDR surface of TR1.9 is revealed to be relatively flat. Other antibodies to intact protein antigens also have relatively flat CDR surfaces, in contrast to antibodies to haptens and other smaller ligands which display pronounced grooves or pockets in their CDR surfaces(28.Padlan E.A. Antibody-Antigen Complexes. R. G. Landes, Austin1994Google Scholar). Results from the crystallographic analysis of many antibody-ligand complexes strongly suggest that the combining site of an antibody is primarily constructed with CDR residues, although on rare occasions neighboring framework residues have been found to be involved also. Thus the CDR surface of TR1.9 most probably portrays the topography of its combining site. The relative flatness of the surface implies that the epitope for TR1.9 on TPO is in the main also flat.The CDRs of TR1.9 are canonical: CDR1-L belongs to the canonical group 2, CDR2-L to group 1 (the only group identified so far), CDR3-L to group 1, CDR1-H to group 1, and CDR2-H to group 3; no canonical groups have been identified for CDR3-H(29.Chothia C.

Coordinates for five Cγ1 domains are available: those from antibody 3D6, and those from the immunoglobulins Kol, New, Hil, and Mcg. The Vκ and VH comparisons were made on the basis of the 72-residue positions which have been found to be structurally equivalent in VL and VH domains, while the Cκ and Cγ1 comparisons were made on the basis of 63 equivalent positions (12.Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar).Tabled 1Tabled 1Figure 5:Stereodrawing of the α-carbon trace of the VL domain of TR1.9 (top) and superposed on the other human Vκ domains of known structure (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6:Stereodrawing of the α-carbon trace of the VH domain of TR1.9 (top) and superposed on the other human VH domains of known structure (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The TR1.9 Vκ is found to be very similar in three-dimensional structure to the other human Vκ domains (Table 4, Fig. 5). Indeed, all the human Vκ domains are seen to be very similar to each other and, with the exception of the CDRs, are essentially superimposable. The average difference among these VL domains is 0.49 Å (S.D. = 0.01); TR1.9 VL differs from the other human Vκ domains on average by 0.42 Å (S.D. = 0.03). These numbers are essentially the same as those obtained when various structures for hen egg white lysozyme, crystallized in different space groups and independently analyzed, are compared (average difference for Cα positions is 0.41 Å (S.D. = 0.02) (for PDB Entries 1HEL (tetragonal) (36.Wilson K.P. Malcolm B.A. Matthews B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10842-10849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 132L (orthorhombic)(37.Rypniewski W.R. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9851-9858Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and 1LYS (monoclinic, with two molecules per asymmetric unit)(38.Harata K. Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 250-257Google Scholar)).The CL of TR1.9 differs from that of 3D6 on average by 0.34 Å, again showing a close similarity, although not unexpectedly since the 3D6 CL domain was used as the search probe in the Molecular Replacement analysis as well as the initial model for the refinement of the TR1.9 CL domain.A greater variation is observed for the human VH domains (Table 5, Fig. 6). Excluding Mcg (see below), the average difference among the human VH domains is 0.63 Å (S.D. = 0.05); TR1.9 VH differs from the other human VH domains on average by 0.72 Å (S.D. = 0.03). As shown in Fig. 6, there are large differences in the structures of the CDR loops, especially in CDR3-H. In addition to the variation in the CDRs, there are differences in the NH2-terminal segment (especially with TR1.9 which has an extra residue inserted after the fourth position) and in other loop regions.The comparison of the human CH1 domains is presented in Table 5. Again excluding Mcg (see below), the CH1 domains are seen to be very similar, the average difference being 0.42 Å (S.D. = 0.01); the TR1.9 CH1 domain differs from those of the other human antibodies on average by 0.39 Å (S.D. = 0.04).In this collection, the immunoglobulin Mcg is found to be the most different, not only in VH but also in the CH1 (Table 5). The consistently larger differences found in the comparisons involving the Mcg domains probably reflect the low resolution of the Mcg structure (3.2 Å). Most of the other structures had been determined at relatively high resolution: TR1.9 Fab at 2.0 Å, New Fab also at 2.0, Kol Fab at 1.9, Hil Fab at 1.8, Rei VL at 2.0, Wat VL at 1.9, and Len VL at 1.8, although the Pot Fv structure was determined at 2.3-Å resolution and 3D6 Fab at only 2.7.The Somatic Mutations in TR1.9The VH region of the TR1.9 heavy chain appears to be derived by somatic mutation from the germline gene V1-3b(39.Shin E.K.

https://openalex.org/W2001804265,"Covalent modification of proteins by attachment of multiubiquitin chains serves as an essential signal for selective protein degradation in eukaryotes. The specificity of ubiquitin-protein conjugation is controlled in part by a diverse group of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs). We have previously reported that the product of the wheat TaUBC7 gene recognizes ubiquitin as a substrate for ubiquitination in vitro, catalyzing the condensation of free ubiquitin into multiubiquitin chains linked via lysine 48 (van Nocker, S., and Vierstra, R. D.(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 10297-10301). Based on this activity, this E2 may play a central role in the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway by assembling chains in vivo. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a three-member gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana (designated AtUBC7/13/14) encoding structural homologs of TaUBC7. Like TaUBC7, recombinant AtUBC7/13/14 proteins formed multiubiquitin chains in vitro. AtUBC7/13/14 mRNAs were found in all tissues examined, and unlike related UBCs from yeast, the levels of mRNA were not elevated by heat stress or cadmium exposure. Transgenic Arabidopsis were engineered to express increased levels of active AtUBC7, for the first time altering the level of an E2 in a higher eukaryote. Plants expressing high levels of AtUBC7 exhibited no phenotypic abnormalities and were not noticeably enriched in multiubiquitinated conjugates. These findings indicate that the in vivo synthesis of multiubiquitin chains is not rate-limited by the abundance of AtUBC7 and/or involves other, yet undefined components.

INTRODUCTIONA variety of essential processes in eukaryotes are regulated by selective protein breakdown via the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992; Vierstra, 1993; Ciechanover, 1994). In this pathway, protein targets are first modified by attachment of a chain of ubiquitin monomers, internally linked through Lys48 of one ubiquitin and the carboxyl-terminal Gly76 of the adjacent ubiquitin. This modification serves as a signal for the subsequent breakdown of the target protein by the 26 S proteasome complex (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992). A 26 S proteasome subunit which recognizes multiubiquitin chains has been described recently and appears to have a high affinity for chains containing four or more ubiquitins (Deveraux et al., 1994; van Nocker et al., 1996). Substrates of the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway include aberrant polypeptides and important cellular regulators such as phytochrome A (Jabben et al., 1989), cyclins (Glotzer et al., 1991), p53 and c-Jun oncoproteins (Scheffner et al., 1993; Treier et al., 1994), the yeast MATα2 transcriptional regulator and Gα protein Gpa1 (Hochstrasser et al., 1991; Madura and Varshavsky, 1994), and components of the NF-κB transcriptional complex (Palombella et al., 1994).Ubiquitin conjugation is an ATP-dependent, multi-step process requiring the sequential action of at least two enzymes (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1992). Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) 1The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin-protein ligasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-initiated polymerase chain reactionbpbase pair(s). function by accepting activated ubiquitin from ubiquitin activating enzymes (E1s) and transferring it to a target protein. This transfer involves the formation of an ubiquitin-E2 thiol-ester intermediate where ubiquitin is linked through Gly76 to a specific cysteine within E2. The bound ubiquitin then becomes conjugated to a target protein via an isopeptide bond between Gly76 of ubiquitin and free lysl ∊-amino groups within the target. In at least some cases, additional recognition factors, termed ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s), are required for substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer (Ciechanover, 1994; Scheffner et al., 1995).Proteins destined for degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway become multiubiquitinated by the attachment of a chain of ubiquitin monomers linked through Gly76 → Lys48 (Chau et al., 1989). The mechanism by which this intermolecular linkage is formed in vivo is unknown, but at least two possibilities exist. In a two- or multi-step process, a single ubiquitin is attached to a target protein; this ubiquitin would then serve as the site for appending additional ubiquitins. Alternatively, multiubiquitin chains could be preformed by concatenation of free ubiquitin monomers; the resulting chain would then be attached to the target in a single step (Chen and Pickart, 1990; van Nocker and Vierstra, 1993). In support of the latter possibility are the observations that (i) several types of E2s exist that catalyze the formation of free multiubiquitin chains, at least in vitro; (ii) free chains can interact with E1 and various E2s and be transferred en masse to targets in vitro with kinetics similar to ubiquitin monomers; and (iii) large cellular pools of free multiubiquitin chains exist in a variety of eukaryotes (Chen and Pickart, 1990; van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991, 1993).We have previously reported the cloning of a cDNA from wheat encoding an E2, TaUBC7, that is capable of forming free multiubiquitin chains in vitro (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991). In an attempt to better elucidate the role of E2s such as TaUBC7 in multiubiquitin chain formation in vivo, we have cloned the corresponding genes from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which is better suited for genetic manipulations. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a three-member gene family (designated AtUBC7/13/14) encoding E2 proteins with 71-76% identity to TaUBC7. Like TaUBC7, these E2s are capable of synthesizing multiubiquitin chains from free ubiquitin in vitro. Transgenic Arabidopsis were engineered to express high levels of AtUBC7. This ectopic expression did not phenotypically alter the plants nor increase the pool of multiubiquitin chains. From this, we conclude that multiubiquitin chain formation in vivo is not limited by AtUBC7/13/14 enzyme levels.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of Clones for Members of the Arabidopsis AtUBC7/13/14 Gene FamilyUnless otherwise indicated, A. thaliana L., ecotype Columbia was used as the source of all DNA and RNA. A 577-bp EcoRI/ScaI fragment from the wheat cDNA, TaUBC7 (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991), was used to probe an amplified λ-ZAP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) cDNA library prepared with poly(A)+ RNA isolated from green leaves (Callis et al., 1990). The probe was radiolabeled with 32P-labeled dCTP by the random priming method (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983) and hybridized to membrane-bound DNA as suggested by the manufacturer (Zeta-Probe; Bio-Rad). Phage corresponding to positive plaques were rescued to phagemids in Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue MRF‘ (Stratagene). This screen resulted in the identification of the cDNA AtUBC7.To isolate the AtUBC7-like cDNAs AtUBC13 and AtUBC14, we screened an amplified, λ-ZAP II cDNA library prepared with 0.5-1-kilobase pair poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 3-day-old etiolated, hypocotyl/cotyledon tissue pretreated with ethylene (Schindler et al., 1992). This screen utilized as the probe a 484-bp BglII fragment from the AtUBC7 cDNA. Genomic clones of AtUBC7-like sequences were isolated from an λ-EMBL 3 genomic library (gift of N. Crawford, University of California, San Diego) by screening with probes derived from each of the AtUBC7/13/14 cDNAs. DNA from phage corresponding to positive plaques was isolated according to the method of Sambrook et al.(1989). In all cases, DNA sequence was determined from both strands (Vieira and Messing, 1987). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses employed programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG) Software Package (Devereux et al., 1984).DNA and RNA Gel Blot AnalysesArabidopsis genomic DNA and total RNA were isolated using Qiagen nucleic acid purification columns as suggested by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). DNA was digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases and fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. To identify all potential AtUBC7-related sequences, the 484-bp BglII coding region fragment of the AtUBC7 cDNA was used as a probe. To identify specific members of the AtUBC7/13/14 family, the following probes, derived from 3′ non-translated or non-transcribed sequence, were used: AtUBC7, the 266-bp BclI/EcoRI fragment from the AtUBC7 cDNA; AtUBC13, the 654-bp BclI/EcoRI fragment from the AtUBC13 genomic clone; AtUBC14, the 196-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment from the AtUBC14 cDNA. The 484-bp BglII coding region fragment of the AtUBC7 cDNA was used as a probe in RNA gel blot analysis. RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels. Nucleic acids were transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes according to Sambrook et al.(1989). Probes were labeled with 32P-labeled dCTP via random priming (Sambrook et al., 1989) and hybridization was at 65°C for 8-16 h in 0.25 M Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2, 22°C) containing 1 mM Na4EDTA and 7% SDS.RT-PCR AnalysesOligo(dT)15 (300 ng) was annealed to 5 μg of total Arabidopsis RNA at 65°C for 5 min in a volume of 36 μl of H2O. Reactions were then brought to 22°C over the course of 10 min. First-strand cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 37°C in a 50-μl reaction containing the annealing reaction and final concentrations of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3, 37°C), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM each dNTP, 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The reaction was then heated to 90°C for 5 min and cooled on ice. Amplification reactions (50 μl) contained up to 2.5 μl of cDNA reaction, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0, 25°C), 50 mM KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega), and 240-320 nM oligonucleotide primers. Reactions were incubated at 91°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of 91°C for 1 min, 54°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 2 min. The final 72°C incubation was extended by 10 min. Reaction products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were confirmed as amplifications from the desired sequence by electrophoretic migration and restriction endonuclease mapping (data not shown). Oligonucleotides specific for the agamous mRNA (5′CCGAATCCGATCCAAGAAG-3′, 5′-CCGTGAATCAAACGGTTGAG-3′) were complementary to sequence corresponding to the 3′ non-coding region and thus avoided conserved sequences encoding the MADS box domain (Yanofsky et al., 1990).Production and Purification of Recombinant E2sUsing PCR with mutagenic primers, restriction sites were introduced into the AtUBC7/13/14 cDNAs at the presumed start codon (CATATG; NdeI) to allow insertion of each cDNA into the E. coli expression vector pET3a (Rosenberg et al., 1987). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying the appropriate plasmid were induced in log phase by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside to the media and lysed 3 h later by sonication. Recombinant E2 proteins were purified from the soluble fraction by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and anion exchange chromatography (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991).Analysis of rE2 ActivityThiol ester assays were performed as described previously (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991) using purified, recombinant enzymes and 125I-labeled ubiquitin. Di-ubiquitin conjugate formation from free ubiquitin was assayed as formerly described (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1993) using 1 unit of recombinant E2. One unit was defined as the amount of E2 protein necessary to form a thiol-ester complex with 1 pmol of 125I-labeled ubiquitin in a 2-min reaction at 0°C containing 75 pmol of 125I-labeled ubiquitin, 20 nM recombinant wheat E1 (TaUBA1; Hatfield et al., 1990), 2 mM MgATP, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 4°C). The di-ubiquitin conjugate was quantified by γ-counting of gel slices containing the product, following its localization by autoradiography.Generation of Transgenic ArabidopsisFor overexpression of AtUBC7, a 500-bp NcoI/BclI fragment from the AtUBC7 cDNA containing the entire AtUBC7 coding region was ligated into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pBluescript SK- (Stratagene). A 567-bp EcoRV/SacI fragment comprising the 500-bp cDNA fragment plus pBluescript sequence was then excised and ligated into the SmaI/SacI sites of pBI121 (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA). For expression of antisense AtUBC7 mRNA, a 590-bp SacI/BclI fragment from the AtUBC7 cDNA containing all of the AtUBC7 coding region and 40 bp of AtUBC7 5′ non-translated region was ligated directly into the SmaI/SacI sites of pBI121. A. thaliana L., ecotype C24 was transformed essentially as described by Valvekens et al.(1988). Progeny from initial transformants harboring AtUBC7 (denoted T1 seedlings) were selected by kanamycin resistance (50 mg/liter). For each transformed line, non-segregating T1 plants were identified and the corresponding T2 plants were utilized for phenotypic and biochemical analyses.Plant Growth ConditionsFor biochemical analyses, wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis were grown in soil in growth chambers at 18°C under 12- or 18-h photoperiods or constant illumination. Heat stress responsiveness of the AtUBC7/13/14 genes was assayed as described previously (Girod et al., 1993). To examine the response of plants to heavy metals, plants were grown on agar-solidified MS media containing 1% sucrose. Fourteen-day old seedlings were flooded with either water or various concentrations of CdCl2, ZnCl2, or CuCl2 (0.1-10 μM) and entire plants were harvested after 8 h.Immunological TechniquesCrude protein extracts were prepared by extracting fresh plant tissue with homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM Na4EDTA (pH 8.0, 4°C), 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol], with the addition of 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mM in isopropyl alcohol) and 100 nM pepstatin A just before use. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) and electroeluted onto Immobilon-P or -NC membranes (Millipore Corp.). Anti-ZmUBC7 serum was produced in a New Zealand White rabbit using as antigen a highly purified recombinant product of the Zea mays ZmUBC7 gene. 2S. van Nocker, A. Miroslava, J. I. Schroeder, and R. D. Vierstra, unpublished data. Anti-ZmUBC7 immunoglobulins were obtained by affinity purification from total serum, using recombinant protein affixed to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). Immunoblot analyses employed either these immunoglobulins, or affinity purified anti-oat ubiquitin immunoglobulins as described (Jabben et al., 1989).Purification of E2s from ArabidopsisCrude protein extracts (see above) were prepared from green leaves and clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Protein precipitating between 40 and 70% ammonium sulfate was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 4°C) containing 1 mM Na4EDTA. The resulting extract was applied to DE52 cellulose, and E2s were eluted in a 100-150 mM step of KCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 4°C) containing 0.5 mM dithioerythritol. All protein purification steps were carried out at 0-4°C.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of the AtUBC7/13/14 GenesAs a first step toward elucidating the mechanism(s) used to synthesize multiubiquitin chains in Arabidopsis, we identified Arabidopsis homologs of wheat TaUBC7, an E2 capable of forming multiubiquitin chains in vitro. A fragment of the TaUBC7 cDNA was used as a probe to screen an amplified λ-ZAP cDNA expression library synthesized with mRNA isolated from Arabidopsis leaf tissue. Examination of 2.5 × 105 phage yielded a new 783-bp cDNA (designated AtUBC7; Fig. 1) related to TaUBC7 but not to any previously characterized AtUBC genes (AtUBC1-6, Sullivan et al.(1994); AtUBC8-12, Girod et al. (1993); and AtUBC15 (formerly AtUBC2-1), Bartling et al.(1993)). The AtUBC7 cDNA ended in a poly(A) tract of 40 residues, preceded within 30 bases by several potential polyadenylation consensus sequences (Dean et al., 1986). A single long open reading frame was identified that would encode a 18,722-Da protein of 166 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 5.33 (Fig. 1 and 2A). The derived amino acid sequence exhibited homology with the wheat TaUBC7 gene product (76% identity, 85% similarity (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991)) and with the yeast E2, ScUBC7 (52% identity, 66% similarity (Jungmann et al., 1993)). In contrast, the predicted protein exhibited at most only ∼41% identity to members of the AtUBC1-3 E2 family, ∼27% identity to the AtUBC4-6 E2 family, ∼38% identity to the AtUBC8-12 E2 family, and ∼58% identity to AtUBC15. Based on these calculations, we concluded that AtUBC7 represents a member of a distinct UBC gene family in Arabidopsis homologous to wheat TaUBC7. Neither TaUBC7 nor AtUBC7 are closely related in amino acid sequence to bovine E2-25 kDa (Fig. 2B), even though both E2 types are capable of assembling multiubiquitin chains in vivo (see below: Chen et al.(1991)).Figure 2:Amino acid sequence relationships between the members of the AtUBC7/13/14 protein family and other E2s. A, amino acid sequence alignment of the AtUBC7/13/14 proteins with wheat TaUBC7 and yeast ScUBC7. Residues which are identical or similar to AtUBC7 are outlined in black or gray, respectively. The 13-residue insertion characteristic of the AtUBC7-type E2s is underlined. The presumed active-site cysteine (Cys-89 for AtUBC7) is marked with an arrow. Numbers refer to the amino acid position for AtUBC7. B, dendrogram of amino acid sequence relationships among the AtUBC7/13/14 protein family, bovine E2-25 kDa, and other E2s. Distance along the horizontal axis separating two sequences is proportional to the divergence between the sequences. Members of the yeast ScUBC4/5 family, the Arabidopsis AtUBC8-12 family, and the human UBCH5a/b/c family are included as an example of closely related E2 protein families from different kingdoms. Sequences shown are Arabidopsis AtUBC7/13/14 (this work) and AtUBC8-12 (Girod et al., 1993), wheat TaUBC7 (van Nocker and Vierstra, 1991), yeast ScUBC7 (Jungmann et al., 1993), CDC34 (Goebl et al., 1988), and ScUBC4/5 (Seufert and Jentsch, 1990), human UBCH5a/b/c (Jensen et al., 1995), tomato UBC1 (K. Feussner and C. Wasternack, unpublished data), and bovine E2-25 kDa (Chen et al., 1991).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To isolate additional AtUBC7-like cDNAs, an amplified λ-ZAP II A. thaliana cDNA expression library was screened as above. This screen of 1 × 105 recombinant phage led to the isolation of six clones identical to AtUBC7 except for the length of the 5′ and 3′ non-translated sequence. All of these AtUBC7 clones had a 3′ non-coding region extending beyond the site of poly(A) addition found in the original AtUBC7 clone. This screen also resulted in the isolation of two cDNAs, designated AtUBC14; they were identical except for the length of the 5′ and 3′ ends, and had 67% nucleotide sequence identity to AtUBC7 (Fig. 1). (After completion of this work, a cDNA identical to AtUBC14 was also identified by random sequencing of an Arabidopsis cDNA library (Genschik et al., 1994).) Following the isolation of a unique genomic clone designated AtUBC13 (below), the λ-ZAP II cDNA expression library was screened as above using a 652-bp BclI/EcoRI fragment from the AtUBC13 genomic clone as a probe. This screen of 1 × 105 recombinant phage yielded three distinct cDNAs with complete nucleotide identity to AtUBC13 genomic sequence, ∼80% identity to AtUBC7, and ∼67% identity to AtUBC14 (Fig. 1). The AtUBC13 cDNAs differed only in the length of 5′ and 3′ non-translated sequences (data not shown).In an attempt to isolate genomic clones of AtUBC7-like sequences, a 484-bp BglII fragment containing 28 bp of 5′ non-coding and nearly the entire coding region of AtUBC7 was used as a probe to screen a λ-EMBL 3 library containing A. thaliana genomic DNA. Examination of 1.5 × 105 phage resulted in the detection of a genomic sequence encompassing the entire cDNA of AtUBC7. An additional clone, designated AtUBC13, was identified that contained AtUBC7-related sequence (above). To identify a genomic equivalent of the AtUBC14 cDNA, the Arabidopsis genomic library was screened using a 196-bp XbaI/HindIII fragment containing AtUBC14 3′ non-translated sequence as a probe. This screen resulted in the detection of a genomic sequence that included the entire cDNA sequence of AtUBC14.The predicted protein products of the AtUBC13/14 genes were nearly identical to AtUBC7 in terms of both apparent molecular mass and charge (AtUBC13: Mr = 18,822, pI = 5.34; AtUBC14: Mr = 18,728, pI = 5.33). All three contain a conserved cysteine (residue 89 for AtUBC7 (Fig. 2A)) at a position similar to that of the active-site cysteine in the yeast E2 RAD6, wheat TaUBC4, and Arabidopsis AtUBC1 (Sung et al., 1990; Sullivan and Vierstra, 1991), implicating this cysteine in the formation of the thiol-ester bond with ubiquitin. The region surrounding this cysteine conformed to the E2 active site motif HPN(I/V)(X)3–4GX(I/V/L)C(I/L)X(I/V)(I/L) that is present in almost all E2s characterized to date. Additional cysteines are present at positions 17 and 158 in all three E2s, and at position 6 in AtUBC13. AtUBC7/13/14 contains a conserved 13-residue sequence (GDDPXGYELASER) carboxyl-terminal to the active site cysteine; a similar insertion is present also in wheat TaUBC7 and yeast ScUBC7 and ScUBC3 (CDC34). Pairwise comparisons of AtUBC7/13/14 revealed a percent deduced amino acid sequence identity of 86-96%. In contrast, AtUBC7/13/14 exhibited at most only 58% amino acid sequence identity to the other Arabidopsis E2s that are fully characterized to date (Bartling et al., 1993; Girod et al., 1993; Sullivan et al., 1994). Because of the structural similarity between AtUBC7, −13, and −14, we propose that they constitute a functionally related family of E2s in Arabidopsis.The complete nucleotide sequences of the AtUBC7/13/14 genomic clones were determined and their structures are depicted in Fig. 3. Five introns exist within the region corresponding to the cDNAs of AtUBC7 and -13, whereas four exist within AtUBC14. The introns in common interrupt the coding regions at identical positions and contain the consensus GT/AG intron borders, with the exception of the 5′-most intron of AtUBC7, which contained GC/AG borders (data not shown). AtUBC7/13/14 do not contain introns outside of the coding region, at least within the region corresponding to the cDNAs.Figure 3:Genomic organization of AtUBC7/13/14.

For each endonuclease used, three hybridizing fragments were identified, even at reduced stringency. Similar analyses using probes unique to AtUBC7, AtUBC13, or AtUBC14 showed that each probe specifically hybridized to one of the three fragments, indicating that AtUBC7/13/14 likely constitute the entire gene family in Arabidopsis (Fig. 4).Figure 4:Gel blots of Arabidopsis genomic DNA probed with AtUBC7/13/14 sequences.

Immunoblot analyses using anti-ZmUBC7 immunoglobulins indicated that the corresponding protein(s) were also present in these tissues (data not shown). The great degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the AtUBC7/13/14 genes, minimal length and high A/T content of non-homologous regions, and relatively low mRNA levels precluded the use of gene-specific probes to detect individual expression patterns by RNA gel blot analysis. Consequently, the expression patterns of the three genes were analyzed individually using quantitative RT-PCR employing gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (Fig. 5B). cDNA was generated simultaneously from individual RNA pools to minimize sample variation, and PCR reactions for all primer pairs were performed simultaneously to allow comparison of the relative PCR product levels between RNA sources. To validate this method, we analyzed mRNA levels of the homeotic gene agamous, which previously had been shown to be expressed in flowers, but not in leaves (Yanofsky et al., 1990). This was confirmed by the greater levels of agamous PCR product derived from flower and silique RNA relative to that from leaf RNA (∼100-fold (Fig. 5B)). Primers specific to each of the AtUBC7/13/14 genes produced RT-PCR products of the expected size. Whereas levels of the AtUBC7 and AtUBC13 PCR products were invariant among leaf, flower, and silique tissues, increased levels of the AtUBC14 PCR product, relative to that of AtUBC7/13, were seen in leaves (Fig. 5B). We found no increase in expression of the AtUBC7/13/14 gene family following a heat stress (37°C for 2 h) sufficient to increase Arabidopsis HSP70 and HSP100 mRNA levels (data not shown). (In yeast, the ScUBC4/5 gene family is strongly responsive to heat stress (Seufert and Jentsch, 1990).) Unlike yeast ScUBC5 and ScUBC7 (Jungmann et al., 1993), the AtUBC7/13/14 mRNAs did not accumulate following exposure of plants to levels of cadmium (10 μM) that severely inhibited growth (data not shown).Figure 5:Analyses of AtUBC7/13/14 expression.

INTRODUCTIONThe presence of circulating antibodies that recognize DNA or RNA is diagnostic of certain autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus(1.Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 2.Deutscher S.L. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Anti-DNA antibodies are also produced in autoimmune mice and have facilitated the study of systemic lupus erythematosus and nucleic acid-protein interactions. The well developed hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody production has made possible the production of numerous murine anti-DNA antibodies. Consequently, there is substantial amino acid sequence information on murine anti-DNA antibodies(3.Schwartz R.S. Stollar B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4.Radic M.Z. Mascelli M.A. Erikson J. Shan H. Weigert M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Murine monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies exhibit a high frequency of basic and aromatic amino acid residues in the hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions (CDR) ( (1)The abbreviations used are: CDRcomplementarity-determining region(s)Fabantigen binding fragment(s)Hheavy chainSCAsingle chain antibody4-4-20anti-fluorescein antibodyssDNAsingle-stranded DNABV04-01anti-ssDNA antibodyDNA-1high affinity ssDNA-binding FabD5low affinity ssDNA-binding FabFRframework region(s)TMtransplantation mutant(s) FabVHvariable H domainCH1constant H domain 1PCRpolymerase chain reactionBSAbovine serum albumindsDNAdouble-stranded DNA.) contained in the antigen binding fragment (Fab)(6.Shlomchik M.

Genet. 1991; 11: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) have substantiated a direct role of these residues in nucleic acid interaction.In general, the heavy chain (H) is thought to contribute more than the light chain to antigen binding, especially through HCDR3(12.Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). HCDR transplantation studies of an anti-fluorescein single chain antibody (SCA) 4-4-20 and an anti-ssDNA SCA BV04-01 have analyzed the roles of individual HCDR in combining site formation(13.Gulliver G.A. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24040-24045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data from the transplantation studies indicated that hybrids containing HCDR3 or HCDR1 of SCA BV04-01 bound oligo(dT). No binding occurred, however, when both HCDR1 and −3 of SCA BV04-01 were present in the context of HCDR2 of SCA BV04-01(13.Gulliver G.A. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24040-24045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gulliver G.A. Bedzyk W.D. Smith R.G. Bode S.L. Tetin S.Y. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While studies have demonstrated the importance of HCDR3 in binding nucleic acid(15.Polymenis M. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5318-5329PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Barbas S.M. Ditzel H.J. Salonen E.M. Yang W. Silverman G.J. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the roles of HCDR1 and −2 in this interaction are less clear.We previously isolated ssDNA-binding Fab from combinatorial bacteriophage display libraries derived from the immunoglobulin repertoire of an autoimmune MRL/lpr mouse(17.Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunological methods were used to characterize two of these Fab, in particular, a high affinity ssDNA-binding Fab (DNA-1) and a Fab (D5) that bound DNA poorly. DNA-1 and D5 were identical in genetic background and were very similar in amino acid sequence, suggesting the Fab may contain similar combining sites. All possible combinations of HCDR transplantation mutants (TM) were previously created between DNA-1 and D5 in order to ascertain the key domains involved in high affinity binding. Results of immunoprecipitation analyses with the HCDR TM suggested HCDR3 was most important in ssDNA binding(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In order to gain a better understanding of DNA-1-oligo(dT) interactions, we undertook a thorough examination of the equilibrium binding properties of highly purified DNA-1, D5, HCDR TM, and mutant Fab containing site-specific amino acid substitutions. Fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as equilibrium gel filtration, was used to characterize the binding of Fab to oligo(dT). The results demonstrated that DNA-1 had a marked preference for oligo(dT) of at least 15 nucleotides and bound with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The HCDR transplantation studies showed that HCDR3 of DNA-1 plays a critical role in oligo(dT) binding and residues in HCDR1 may also affect this interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsGamma Bind Sepharose, Sephadex, oligo(dT)-Sepharose, a Mono-S column, and polynucleotides were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The other oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility, using an Applied Biosystems DNA Synthesizer Model 380B. All oligonucleotides were column-purified and quantitated spectrophotometrically(19.Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. Lonberg N. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Antibodies were purchased from Pierce. [γ32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Fisher, unless otherwise noted.Fab Gene Isolation, Construction of HCDR Transplants, and Site-specific MutagenesisThe DNA-1 and D5 genes were previously isolated from an expression library, derived from autoimmune MRL/lpr mice immunoglobulin G (IgG) cDNA, contained in plasmid pComb3(17.Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HCDR transplants were constructed between DNA-1 and D5 as described previously(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The chimeric Fd (VH+ CH1) DNAs were subcloned into pComb3 containing DNA-1 light chain.VSX, a derivative of the plasmid pBC containing a chloramphenicol-resistance gene (Stratagene) and lacking the VspI and SacI restriction enzyme sites, was used as an intermediate vector for mutagenesis and sequencing procedures. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using splice overlap PCR(20.Higuchi R. Innis M. Gelfand D. Sninsky J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Typically, two fragments of DNA-1 or D5 H DNA in VSX were amplified in two separate reactions using standard PCR conditions, resulting in fragments overlapping by at least 10 nucleotides. Full-length Fd (VH+ CH1) products were generated by annealing and extension of the two overlapping fragments and were amplified by 25 cycles of PCR following the addition of flanking T3 and T7 primers. The final products were purified, cut with XhoI (Boehringer Mannheim) and VspI (Life Technologies, Inc.) restriction enzymes, and ligated into similarly cut DNA-1- or D5-VSX plasmid. Having verified the desired mutation had been introduced, an XhoI-BamHI fragment containing the VH region was subcloned into XhoI-BamHI cut DNA-1-pComb3 or D5-pComb3, thus replacing the wild type sequence. Using this two-step procedure, only a 140-nucleotide fragment derived from PCR was present in the final construct, thus reducing the amount of DNA sequencing necessary to check for mutations caused by Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) errors. The correct mutation was verified by DNA sequencing using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The relevant H amino acid sequences of DNA-1, D5, TM, as well as site-specific mutants are shown in Fig. 1.Bacterial Expression and Purification of FabCells from a single colony of Fab-expressing Escherichia coli DH12S (Life Technologies, Inc.) were grown, treated, and disrupted as described previously(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 32,540 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was applied to a 10-ml goat IgG anti-mouse Fab affinity column that had been pre-equilibrated with 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The column was washed with 0.5 M phosphate, 0.5 M citrate buffer, pH 4.7, and the Fab were eluted with the same buffer at pH 2.8, immediately neutralized, and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. The dialyzed preparations were passed over a Mono-S cationic exchange column and eluted with a 0-250 mM NaCl gradient. Fractions from the different steps were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1971; 227: 680-685Crossref Scopus (205955) Google Scholar) and were stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213177) Google Scholar) and further verified by the calculation of extinction coefficients. UV absorption spectra were characterized on a Hitachi U 2000 spectrophotometer (Japan).Circular DichroismCircular dichroism (CD) was used to monitor the overall secondary structure of the purified Fab using an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature control and stirring unit. The spectra were collected from samples in 0.1-cm cuvettes at 25°C in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Protein concentration ranged from 0.2 to 0.8 mg/ml.Equilibrium Gel FiltrationA direct assessment of the binding of oligo(dT) to Fab was determined using equilibrium gel filtration(23.Hummel J.P. Dryer W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 63: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Solutions of DNA-1 were preincubated for 30 min at 4°C with a predetermined concentration of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, with 0.12 M NaCl plus BSA (0.2 mg/ml). Sephadex G-50 columns (3 ml) were equilibrated with two-column volumes of the same buffer. Samples (150 μl) were applied to columns and eluted at room temperature. Fractions (100 μl) were collected, and a 50-μl portion was tested for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (Packard, Tri-Carb 2100TR).Fluorescence TitrationThe fluorescence titration experiments were carried out using a SLM 8100 spectrofluorimeter interfaced to a DELL/433 PC running SLM AMINCO 8100 series 2 software. The titrations were performed at 20°C with varying amount of nucleic acid added to a fixed Fab concentration (4-200 nM) in 2 ml of TBS. Protein fluorescence was measured as described by Kim et al.(24.Kim C. Paulus B.F. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14197-14206Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) with 292 nm excitation and 346 nm emission (1-cm cuvette path length). The excitation and emission bandwidths were set at 4 nm. Each reading was collected for 5-20 s after a 0.5-1-min equilibration. Values reported are an average of at least three independent measurements. All experiments were corrected for dilution and photobleaching.Calculation of Binding ParametersThe equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values for DNA-1, D5, and the mutant Fab were determined from binding curves derived from titration or equilibrium gel filtration profiles, using a single binding site curve-fitting procedure in Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software).RESULTSDNA-1 PurificationSpectral analysis of DNA-1 and D5 obtained by affinity chromatography (17.Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) indicated that these preparations may contain nucleic acid. Therefore, an additional cation exchange fast protein liquid chromatography purification step was used in the present study to obtain highly purified Fab preparations. The Fab were purified to apparent homogeneity, as evidenced by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and had a A280/A260 ratio of 1.90 indicating that they were devoid of nucleic acid (data not shown).DNA-1 Binding Specificity and ActivityFluorescence titration experiments were performed in order to evaluate the specificity of DNA-1 and to identify a preferred ligand for subsequent binding experiments. Samples of DNA-1 were titrated with increasing concentrations of polynucleotide, and upon excitation at 292 nm, fluorescence emission spectra were collected by scanning from 310 to 400 nm. Addition of saturating concentrations of nucleic acid produced significant quenching of the Fab fluorescence (Fig. 2). The changes in fluorescence emission at 346 nm were used for the generation of binding curves. The Kd values were determined using a single binding site curve-fitting procedure with multiple iterations. Table 1 summarizes the binding constants for the various oligonucleotides to DNA-1, as measured by fluorescence titration. As shown, the Kd values for DNA-1 with poly(G), poly(dC), and poly(dA) were 2-5-fold greater than those for DNA-1 with poly(U); however, all of them were significantly greater than the Kd for poly(dT) which was 100 nM. The data demonstrated DNA-1 had a marked specificity for poly(dT) and was, therefore, suitable for further binding studies.Figure 2:Poly(dT)-induced tryptophan fluorescence quenching of DNA-1. DNA-1 (200 nM; solid line) in TBS was excited at 292 nm, and fluorescence emission spectrum from 310 to 400 nm was collected. Saturating levels of poly(dT) (400 nM) were subsequently added, and quenched spectrum (broken line) was obtained. Spectra were corrected for Raman scattering.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1The percentage of functional DNA-1 in the preparations was determined by binding to oligo(dT)-Sepharose, in order to accurately determine subsequent Kd values. All of the Fab reversibly bound to this resin and eluted with 500 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, suggesting that approximately 100% of the purified Fab was functional.Optimal Ligand SizeThe optimal oligo(dT) length for DNA-1 binding was evaluated by both fluorescence titration and equilibrium gel filtration techniques. Equilibrium gel filtration was used as an alternative technique to directly monitor complex formation. As shown in Fig. 3, DNA-1 bound with the same affinity to oligo(dT) 15 nucleotides or greater in length, with a Kd of approximately 140 nM, although binding was observed with (dT)5, as well. A similar ligand size was obtained for DNA-1 using equilibrium gel filtration (Table 2).Figure 3:Fluorescence titrations of DNA-1 with oligonucleotides of different length. The fractions of free DNA-1 were calculated and displayed as a function of total concentration of oligonucleotides. Titration curves for (dT)5 (▴), (dT)10 (▪), (dT)15 (▾), and (dT)20 (○) are shown. Calculated Kdvalues are included in Table 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tabled 1Binding Stoichiometry and ReversibilityTo evaluate the stoichiometry of binding of (dT)20, (dT)15, and (dT)10, fluorescence titration experiments were performed with DNA-1 concentrations in excess of the Kd value. Typical fluorescence titration curves for (dT)20 and (dT)15 are shown in Fig. 4A. The stoichiometry of binding was found to be 1 mol of oligonucleotide per mol of DNA-1. For comparison, the binding of 32P-labeled (dT)20, (dT)15, and (dT)10 to the same DNA-1 preparation was also measured using equilibrium gel filtration (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Quantitation of bound oligo(dT), determined from the results of equilibrium gel filtration, yielded dissociation constants and stoichiometric values that were consistent with the binding parameters determined from fluorescence titration experiments (Table 2).Figure 4:Stoichiometry determination by fluorescence titration and equilibrium gel filtration.

B, elution profiles for binding of DNA-1 with 32P-labeled (dT)15. Solutions of DNA-1 (1 (▾), 0.1 (▪), and 0.01 μM (▴)) were preincubated 30 min at 4°C with the same concentration of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide in TBS plus BSA (0.2 mg/ml). Solutions (150 μl) were applied to columns, equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted. Fractions (100 μl) were collected and monitored for radioactivity. Data obtained from a series of experiments were used for the generation of binding isotherms. The binding parameters were calculated using a single binding site curve-fitting procedure (Table 2). DNA-1 recovery (greater than 90%) and elution volumes, for both free DNA-1 and oligonucleotides, were determined in independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The DNA-1-oligonucleotide complex was examined for ionic strength sensitivity using fluorescence titrations. The initial fluorescence signal was almost completely recovered with NaCl concentrations greater than 1 M, establishing that the changes in DNA-1 fluorescence observed upon the addition of oligo(dT) were the result of a reversible interaction (data not shown). The dissociation of the complex at high salt concentrations is also indicative that aggregation or precipitation had not occurred. The same effect probably led to elution of DNA-1 from oligo(dT)-Sepharose (mentioned previously).Characterization of HCDR TMAll possible HCDR TM between DNA-1 and D5 (Fig. 1) were constructed previously(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), expressed in E. coli, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated the resulting purified Fab preparations were homogeneous (data not shown). Results of UV absorption spectroscopy demonstrated the absence of nucleic acid impurities. The CD spectra of purified DNA-1, D5, and HCDR TM were analyzed in order to verify the conservation of secondary structure of the Fab. Comparison of the CD spectra (Fig. 5) indicated very similar amplitudes and shapes for all Fab investigated, typical for proteins with β-sheet structure(25.Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1451-1467Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 26.Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Therefore, the CD analysis indicated the HCDR TM were not grossly altered due to transplantation.Figure 5:CD spectra of DNA-1, D5, and HCDR TM. Spectra of proteins (0.2-0.8 mg/ml, 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0) were obtained in the range of 205-240 nm at room temperature and corrected for contributions of buffer components. -, DNA-1; - •••, D5; -, 1 1 5; - -, 5 5 1; - - -, 5 1 5; •••, 5 1 1; - -, 1 5 1; - • - •, 1 5 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence Titration Binding Analysis of Purified HCDR TMD5 and the purified HCDR TM were examined for their ability to bind (dT)20, (dT)15, and (dT)10 using fluorescence titration. D5 was found to bind (dT)15 with a Kd of >20 μM, over 2 orders of magnitude higher than DNA-1 (Table 3). HCDR3 of DNA-1, when transplanted into D5 (TM 551), conferred DNA binding onto D5 with Kd values approximately 4 times greater than that of DNA-1 levels (Table 3). The presence of either or both DNA-1 HCDR1 and −2 in the context of D5 HCDR3 did not, however, improve the ability of D5 to bind oligo(dT). Interestingly, the mutant 151, containing both CDR1 and 3 of DNA-1, had a similar if not somewhat increased affinity for oligo(dT) to mutant 551, containing only HCDR3 of DNA-1. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental involvement of HCDR3 in nucleic acid interaction.Tabled 1Possible Influence of HCDR1HCDR1 of D5, in the presence of HCDR2 and 3 of DNA-1, resulted in substantially increased fluorescence quenching values (Table 3). The amino acid differences between DNA-1 and D5 in HCDR1 and FR2, which might be responsible for this phenomenon, were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, there are only three amino acid differences between DNA-1 and D5 in HCDR1 and FR2. A mutant version of 551 was created in which the Trp-33 of D5 HCDR1 was converted to a Val residue (W33V), to determine if this residue was responsible for changes in fluorescence quenching. This Trp to Val conversion led to a significant decrease in the fluorescence quenching value. In addition, this mutant (W33V) bound oligo(dT) with almost 4 times higher affinity than 551 (data not shown).Positively charged amino acid residues might also be involved in the interaction with oligonucleotide at the Fab combining site(8.Radic M.Z.

Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). D5 contains a Lys at position 31, in place of a Ser at this position in DNA-1. In addition, the FR2 difference of an Arg at position 40 in D5, versus a Lys in DNA-1, may also be of importance. Both mutations, K31S and R40K, were created in TM 551 and DNA-1, respectively (Fig. 1). The mutant Fab were purified and analyzed by fluorescence titration. Neither substitution significantly altered the Kd or maximal quenching values, suggesting differences at position 31 or 40 are not key for nucleic acid interaction (data not shown). These results indicate that Trp-33 is solely responsible for the observed increased quenching and Kd difference.DISCUSSIONWe previously described the isolation and preliminary characterization of DNA-1, the first anti-nucleic acid Fab obtained from a combinatorial bacteriophage Fab display library generated from autoimmune sources(17.Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present study, both fluorescence quenching and equilibrium gel filtration techniques were employed to evaluate the binding parameters of DNA-1 and TM under solution equilibrium conditions.Fluorescence titrations were performed with polynucleotides of different base composition to examine the specificity of DNA-1-ligand interactions. The results demonstrated that DNA-1 preferred poly(dT). A similar selectivity has also been observed for the ssDNA binding proteins Pf3 (27.Powell M.D. Gray D.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12538-12547Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and g5p(28.Sang B. Gray D.M. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1989; 7: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that the affinity of these interactions was inversely related to nucleotide stacking in the free homopolymer. Thus, the Kd values of DNA-1 were less for poly(dT) and poly(U) presumably because they have the most unstacked structure.Binding, as monitored by fluorescence quenching titration, indicated the optimal ligand for DNA-1 Fab interaction was approximately 15 nucleotides, although smaller oligo(dT) could bind with reduced affinity. DNA-1 bound to oligo(dT)n (n ≥ 15) with an affinity of 100-150 nM and a stoichiometry of 1 mol of oligonucleotide per mol of Fab. As expected, there was a significant decrease in the affinity of DNA-1 for oligo(dT) in the presence of high salt concentrations. Thus, formation of the DNA-1-oligonucleotide complex was reversible and not a result of aggregation. The Kd values and stoichiometry of the complex obtained by fluorescence measurements were verified by equilibrium gel filtration experiments. These results were similar to those reported for anti-ssDNA Fab BV04-01, which had been shown to contain a binding site size of 6-8 nucleotides and a Kd of 450 nM for (dT)8(29.Rumbley C.A. Denzin L.K. Yantz L. Tetin S.Y. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13667-13674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic data obtained for a complex of BV04-01 with (dT)3 led to the conclusion that the antigen combining site was a shallow cleft(11.Herron J.N. He X.M. Ballard D.W. Blier P.R. Pace P.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Edmundson A.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). DNA-1 and BV04-01, while varying in CDR amino acid sequence, had similar binding properties for ligands of the same repetitive structure, perhaps reflecting similarly shaped combining sites.HCDR TM were constructed between DNA-1 and D5, in order to examine the importance of HCDR in ssDNA-binding. These Fab were chosen for HCDR transplantation because they have different binding properties, identical genetic background, very similar sequence, and perhaps, similarly shaped combining sites. The suggestion that DNA-1 and D5 contain similarly shaped combining sites is supported by models of numerous anti-DNA Fab derived from x-ray crystal studies (30.Barry M.M. Mol C.D. Anderson W.F. Lee J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3623-3632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from molecular modeling of DNA-1 and D5. ( (2)A. A. Komissarov, M. J. Calcutt, M. T. Marchbank, E. N. Peletskaya, and S. L. Deutscher, unpublished results.) Immunoprecipitation methods were used previously to analyze the TM and results indicated numerous CDR combinations, particularly those including HCDR3 of DNA-1, allowed for immune complex precipitation. However, the TM did not show a strict specificity for oligo(dT) in that other nucleic acids including U1RNA were also recognized(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). That additional components in the immunoprecipitation reactions (i.e. anti-Fab antibody) may have acted to artificially stabilize or destabilize the TM-nucleic acid complexes remained to be determined.In the present study, more direct methods of binding analysis, including fluorescence quenching and equilibrium gel filtration, were used to analyze the HCDR TM. Highly purified HCDR TMs were monitored by CD spectroscopy prior to equilibrium binding analyses. Results indicated there were no significant differences in CD spectra, indicative of the conservation of the secondary structure of the Fab. HCDR3 of DNA-1 in the context of all other HCDR combinations of D5 or DNA-1 resulted in the ability of the Fab to bind oligo(dT) with a similar affinity as that of native DNA-1. The TM did not bind well to U1RNA, in contrast to results with immunoprecipitation binding assays (18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The HCDR1 and 2 of DNA-1 in the context of HCDR3 of D5 or DNA-1 did not drastically affect binding to oligo(dT), suggesting less involvement of these HCDRs in direct interaction. However, the transplantation of HCDR1 from D5 into DNA-1 was accompanied by more than a 50% increase in the maximal value of fluorescence quenching and was due to an additional Trp residue present in HCDR1 of D5. Taken together, the results of the transplantation experiments demonstrated a critical involvement of HCDR3 of DNA-1 in the direct binding of oligo(dT) and, furthermore, suggested the possible involvement of residue 33 of HCDR1 in complex formation.These data are consistent with previous studies of HCDR3 grafting, which also illuminated the contribution of this region to Z-DNA (15.Polymenis M. Stollar B.D. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5318-5329PubMed Google Scholar) and dsDNA (16.Barbas S.M. Ditzel H.J. Salonen E.M. Yang W. Silverman G.J. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) binding. HCDR transplantation studies with an anti-fluorescein SCA 4-4-20 (pocket-shaped combining site) and the anti-ssDNA SCA BV04-01 (cleft-shaped combining site) resulted in binding with the presence of any two HCDR from the same SCA, tandemly arranged. Transplantation of HCDR1 from SCA 4-4-20 to SCA BV04-01 led to significant changes in CD spectra of the mutants, reflecting possible changes in their secondary structure. These results, and subsequent studies of the stability of SCA 4-4-20 and SCA BV04-01 TM to denaturation(31.Gulliver G.A. Rumbley C.A. Carrero J. Voss Jr., E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5158-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), were explained from the point of view that there were drastic differences in the binding site shapes and charge distribution in the combining sites of the constructed TM.Our results on HCDR transplantation were obtained with TM of similar sequence, secondary structure, and probable combining sites. Therefore, our data may be interpreted in terms of the retention of combining site conformation after CDR transplantation, suggesting the observed differences in oligo(dT) binding were probably due to the contribution of the individual HCDR in ligand interaction. X-ray crystallographic structural investigations are now in progress with liganded DNA-1 and should provide sufficient data to elucidate the combining site structure. A molecular model of DNA-1 has been constructed based on the crystal structure of the mouse monoclonal antibody R19.9, which contains very similar framework sequences and CDR lengths(32.Lascombe M.B. Alzari P.M. Boulot G. Saludjian P. Tougard P. Berek C. Haba S. Rosen E.M. Nisonoff A. Poljak R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analysis of the model indicates that Tyr-97 and Arg-98 (Fig. 1) are at the apex of HCDR3 of DNA-1 and are likely to be most crucial for DNA binding. The importance of the individual amino acids of DNA-1 HCDR3 in ligand interaction, however, awaits future mutagenesis and binding studies. INTRODUCTIONThe presence of circulating antibodies that recognize DNA or RNA is diagnostic of certain autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus(1.Tan E.M. Adv. Immunol. 1989; 44: 93-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 2.Deutscher S.L. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3299-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Anti-DNA antibodies are also produced in autoimmune mice and have facilitated the study of systemic lupus erythematosus and nucleic acid-protein interactions. The well developed hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody production has made possible the production of numerous murine anti-DNA antibodies. Consequently, there is substantial amino acid sequence information on murine anti-DNA antibodies(3.Schwartz R.S. Stollar B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 4.Radic M.Z. Mascelli M.A. Erikson J. Shan H. Weigert M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). HCDR transplantation studies of an anti-fluorescein single chain antibody (SCA) 4-4-20 and an anti-ssDNA SCA BV04-01 have analyzed the roles of individual HCDR in combining site formation(13.Gulliver G.A. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24040-24045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data from the transplantation studies indicated that hybrids containing HCDR3 or HCDR1 of SCA BV04-01 bound oligo(dT). No binding occurred, however, when both HCDR1 and −3 of SCA BV04-01 were present in the context of HCDR2 of SCA BV04-01(13.Gulliver G.A. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24040-24045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Gulliver G.A. Bedzyk W.D. Smith R.G. Bode S.L. Tetin S.Y. Voss Jr., E.W. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 5318-5329PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Barbas S.M. Ditzel H.J. Salonen E.M. Yang W. Silverman G.J. Burton D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2529-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the roles of HCDR1 and −2 in this interaction are less clear.We previously isolated ssDNA-binding Fab from combinatorial bacteriophage display libraries derived from the immunoglobulin repertoire of an autoimmune MRL/lpr mouse(17.Calcutt M.J. Kremer M.T. Giblin M.F. Quinn T.P. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 137: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Immunological methods were used to characterize two of these Fab, in particular, a high affinity ssDNA-binding Fab (DNA-1) and a Fab (D5) that bound DNA poorly. DNA-1 and D5 were identical in genetic background and were very similar in amino acid sequence, suggesting the Fab may contain similar combining sites. All possible combinations of HCDR transplantation mutants (TM) were previously created between DNA-1 and D5 in order to ascertain the key domains involved in high affinity binding. Results of immunoprecipitation analyses with the HCDR TM suggested HCDR3 was most important in ssDNA binding(18.Calcutt M.J. Komissarov A.A. Marchbank M.T. Deutscher S.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In order to gain a better understanding of DNA-1-oligo(dT) interactions, we undertook a thorough examination of the equilibrium binding properties of highly purified DNA-1, D5, HCDR TM, and mutant Fab containing site-specific amino acid substitutions. Fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as equilibrium gel filtration, was used to characterize the binding of Fab to oligo(dT). The results demonstrated that DNA-1 had a marked preference for oligo(dT) of at least 15 nucleotides and bound with a 1:1 stoichiometry. The HCDR transplantation studies showed that HCDR3 of DNA-1 plays a critical role in oligo(dT) binding and residues in HCDR1 may also affect this interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1510076229,"Calcium is thought to play an important role in the genesis of atherosclerotic lesions, but the precise mechanisms involved are unclear. In the present investigation, we have used in vitro systems to investigate the effects of calcium on one key aspect of lesion development: the migration of macrophages and macrophage/foam cells. Using agarose plate migration assays, the migratory characteristics of macrophages exposed to 1) no lipoprotein, 2) low density lipoprotein (LDL), 3) acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL), and ) oxidized low density lipoprotein were examined. The most marked stimulatory effect on macrophage mobility was observed when freshly isolated cells were exposed to acLDL during the migration assay. High levels of exogenous calcium were found to suppress the stimulatory effect of acLDL on migration. As the responses of macrophages exposed to a uniform concentration of agents in the surrounding medium may differ from chemo- tactic responses to a concentration gradient, the migration of macrophages, with and without preexposure to acLDL or LDL, was studied using micro- chemotaxis Boyden chambers. Under these conditions, calcium acted as a highly potent chemoat- tractant, especially to cells that had been preincubated with acLDL. These results suggest how elevated external calcium concentration leads initially to macrophage recruitment, and subsequently to foam cell aggregation and lipid core formation, in association with calcification, in the developing atherosclerotic plaque.—Shi, H., Severs, N.

However, the molecular mechanism (or mechanisms) underlying this cognitive deficit remains unknown. Here we report that brain fyn kinase, which has been proposed to be involved in spatial learning and memory, was unresponsive to glutamatergic stimulation in mice with MAIDS. Thus, whereas application of glu-tamate to hippocampal slices from control mice increased fyn protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity more than 2,5-fold, these changes were significantly impaired in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mice. Moreover, mice with MAIDS exhibited an abnormal histological distribution of fyn PTK in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that virus-associated disruption of fyn kinase-mediated signaling contributes to the cognitive deficits observed in mice with MAIDS and other retrovirus-induced encephalopa-thies.—Sei, Y., Whitesell, L., Kustova, Y., Paul, I A., Morse, H.

The resultant fusion toxin, DAB389 IL-2(T439P), was 300-fold less cytotoxic than wild type DAB389 IL-2, partially as the result of a 100-fold decrease in binding affinity for the high affinity form of the IL-2 receptor. However, DAB389 IL-2(T439P) stimulated DNA synthesis to a greater extent than expected.

The interleukin-2 diphtheria toxin-related fusion protein, DAB389 IL-2, is composed of amino acid residues 2-133 of IL-2, genetically fused to the first 386 residues of diphtheria toxin (DT)(16.Williams D.P.

The fusion toxin is targeted to cells that express the high affinity form of the IL-2 receptor and is internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis.

In the present study, we introduced the Q126D and T51P mutations described above, as well as an E106K mutation, into the IL-2 receptor binding domain of DAB389 IL-2. We studied the effects of these mutations on cytotoxicity, binding affinity, and kinetics of cytotoxicity. We also created analogous mutations, in which the catalytic domain of DT was mutated to a nontoxic form, so we could study the effects of the IL-2 receptor binding domain on stimulation of DNA synthesis. Our results indicate that the Gln residue is involved with binding affinity and activation of DNA synthesis, and that activation may affect cytotoxicity. The Thr residue appears to affect receptor binding and signaling internalization of the fusion toxin-receptor complex. The Glu residue that was mutated does not appear to play a critical role in the IL-2 binding domain of the fusion toxin. A schematic representation of the gene encoding DAB389 IL-2, the restriction digest sites used, and the single amino acid residue changes are shown in Fig. 1.

The plasmids encoding DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) and DAB389 IL-2(E494K) were created by PCR mutagenesis of the wild type, DAB389 IL-2 gene, and cassette exchange encompassing the mutated site(21.Ausubel F.M.

In the case of the plasmid encoding DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), a 229-nucleotide XbaI to SalI exchange was performed, and for DAB389 IL-2(E494K), a 241-nucleotide XbaI to HindIII cassette exchange was performed. The E149S mutation in the DT catalytic domain was introduced into each of the above mutants by an NcoI to SphI exchange from the gene encoding DA(E149S)B389 IL-2. In all cases the constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (22.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52631) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase reagent kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) The mutant fusion toxins, and the corresponding mutations in IL-2, are listed in Table 1.Tabled 1 Escherichia coli JM101 was the host strain for plasmid propagation, and the HMS174 or HMS174 DE3 strain (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as host for the expression of DAB389 IL-2 and all the mutants. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 391 PCR Mate DNA synthesizer. The oligonucleotides were removed from the columns and deprotected as recommended by Applied Biosystems. The oligonucleotides were vacuum-dried, resuspended in TE buffer, and the concentration determined using absorbance A260 readings (23.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 90-91Google Scholar). PCR was performed using a PCR reagent kit (Perkin Elmer Corp.). The conditions for PCR were 1 min at 95°C for strand separation, 1 min at 37°C for primer hybridization, and 1 min at 72°C for the polymerase activity. The cycle was repeated 25 times. Expression of DAB389 IL-2, DAB389 IL-2(T439P), DAB389 IL-2(E494K), DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), and their corresponding E149S catalytic domain mutations, were all under control of the T7 polymerase promoter in derivatives of pet11d (Novagen, Madison WI). The plasmids encoding DAB389 IL-2, DA(E149S)B389 IL-2, DAB389 IL-2(E494K), and DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(E494K) were transformed into HMS174 for expression. The bacteria were propagated to an A600 = 0.8 in LB/ampicillin/maltose, and protein expression was induced by the addition of the λ coliphage derivative, CE6. The expressed proteins formed inclusion bodies under these conditions, and these inclusion bodies were isolated, denatured, and refolded as described previously(24.vanderSpek J.C. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Murphy J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12077-12082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After refolding overnight at 4°C, the proteins were concentrated using a Filtron concentrator and an Mr 10,000 cut-off filter (Filtron, Northborough, MA). The proteins were then purified further by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The fusion toxins were applied to the column and washed extensively with 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The proteins were eluted using a linear 0-0.8 M KCl gradient. The fusion toxins DAB389 IL-2(T439P), DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(T439P), DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), and DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(Q514D) were expressed from HMS174 DE3. One liter of bacterial cultures were incubated in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol to A600 = 0.8. Expression of the fusion toxins was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1.0 mM. The bacteria were incubated an additional 2-3 h, with shaking, at 37°C and then harvested by centrifugation. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50.0 ml of buffer 101 (50 mM KH2PO4, 10 mM EDTA, 750 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and sonicated on ice for 15 min (dial 6, 40% duty cycle, pulsed microtip, Branson Cell Disruptor). The lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the resulting supernatants were 0.4-μm filtered. The filtrates were loaded onto an anti-diphtheria immunoaffinity column and washed with several column volumes of buffer 101. The fusion toxins were eluted in buffer 104 (100 mM KH2PO4, 4 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2) in final volumes of approximately 50.0 ml. The proteins were next dialyzed overnight, at 4°C, against refolding buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 1 mM oxidized glutathione). The proteins were further purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, as described above. All protein concentrations were determined using Pierce protein assay reagent. The proteins were analyzed for purity by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2). HUT 102/6TG cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT): 2 mM glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). For the cytotoxicity assays, 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of complete medium were seeded into each well of a 96-well, V-bottomed microtiter dish (Linbro). The fusion toxins were added so the final volume was 200 μl/well, and the fusion toxin concentrations ranged from 10−7 M down to 10−12 M. The plates were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and then centrifuged at 170 × g for 5 min. The medium was aspirated and replaced with 200 μl of leucine-free minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1.0 μCi/ml [14C]leucine (280 mCi/mmol, DuPont NEN), 2 mML-glutamine, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 IU/ml penicillin. The cells were pulsed for 90 min and then centrifuged at 170 × g for 5 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were lysed by addition of 60 μl/well 0.4 M KOH and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The proteins were precipitated out by addition of 140 μl/well 10% trichloroacetic acid and incubating for another 10 min at room temperature. The insoluble proteins were collected on glass fiber filters using a PhD cell harvester (Cambridge Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA). Radioactivity was determined according to standard methods. All assays were performed in quadruplicate, and medium alone served as a control. The displacement of 125I-labeled recombinant IL-2 from the high affinity form of the IL-2 receptor was measured following the method of Wang and Smith(25.Wang H.M. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). HUT102/6TG cells were harvested and washed thoroughly in complete RPMI 1640 medium. The cells (1 × 106/point) were incubated with 200 pM 125I-labeled recombinant IL-2 (0.7 μCi/pmol, DuPont NEN) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled recombinant IL-2, DAB389 IL-2, or the related mutant fusion toxins. The cells were overlaid on a mixture of 80% 550 fluid (Accumetric Inc., Elizabethtown, KY) and 20% paraffin oil (density = 1.03 g/ml) and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The reactions were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 2 min. The cell pellet, representing bound ligand, and the aqueous phase, representing unbound ligand, were counted in a Beckman Gamma 5500 counter. The apparent dissociation constants (Ki values) were determined based on the concentration of unlabeled ligand required to displace 50% 125I-labeled recombinant IL-2 binding. (The Ki for DAB389 IL-2(T439P) is an estimate determined from Fig. 4, as an IC50 was not reached, even at the highest concentration of toxin tested). CTLL-2 cells were maintained in complete RPMI, as above, that was further supplemented with 5 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 nM recombinant IL-2. For the assays, the CTLL-2 cells were washed twice in the above medium, without IL-2, and seeded in the medium, again without IL-2, at 1.5 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well, V-bottomed microtiter plate. The catalytic domain mutants of the fusion toxins, or recombinant IL-2, were added to final concentrations ranging from 10−7 M down to 10−12 M. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 24 h and then 1.0 μCi of [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) was added to each well. The cells were pulsed for 6 h at 37°C, harvested on glass fiber filters, and radioactivity was determined using standard methods. Each assay point was performed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and the assays were performed several times for each fusion toxin (Fig. 5). The results for activation reported in Table 2 are a comparison of activation by 10−8 M concentrations of the fusion toxins to 10−8 M IL-2.Tabled 1 HUT 102/6TG cells were seeded in 100 μl of complete medium, at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well, as described above for the cytotoxicity assays. The cytotoxic forms of the fusion toxins were added to a final concentration of 10−9 M, and the cells were incubated for 1, 3, 5, 9, 12, 15, or 18 h before pulsing and harvesting, as described above. A schematic representation of the gene encoding DAB389 IL-2 is shown in Fig. 1. The mutations in the IL-2 receptor binding domain of the gene, where nucleotides were changed to encode different amino acid residues, are indicated. The Glu → Ser mutation in the catalytic domain of DT is also indicated. The mutations in IL-2, corresponding to the mutations in the IL-2 receptor binding domain of the fusion toxins, are shown in Table 1. The fusion toxins DAB389 IL-2, DA(E149S)B389 IL-2, DAB389 IL-2(E494K), DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(E494K), DAB389 IL-2(T439P), DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(T439P), DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), and DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(Q514D) were expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” Following purification, the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 2). The full-length forms of the proteins all migrated at approximately 57.7 kDa, in agreement with their calculated molecular weights. Western blot analysis was also performed and indicated the proteins were all immunoreactive with DT antibody (data not shown). DAB389 IL-2 possessed an IC50 of 2.2 × 10−12 M in the cytotoxicity assay (Fig. 3, Table 2). The corresponding catalytic domain mutation, DA(E149S)B389 IL-2, in which a Glu residue was changed to a Ser residue, was not cytotoxic (Table 2). The apparent binding affinities (Ki values) were 3.6 × 10−10 M and 5.7 × 10−10 M, respectively (Fig. 4, Table 2). DA(E149S)B389 IL-2 was tested for stimulation of DNA synthesis by a CTLL-2 cell [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, and a representative assay is shown in Fig. 5. The stimulation by 10−8 M DA(E149S)B389 IL-2 was 83% that of the stimulation induced by 10−8 M IL-2 (Table 2). The stimulation by 10−8 M DAB389 IL-2 was only 4% that of 10−8 M IL-2. DAB389 IL-2(E494K), in which a Glu residue in the IL-2 binding domain was changed to a Lys residue (Fig. 1), possessed an IC50 of 1.6 × 10−11 M, approximately 7-fold less than the wild type cytoxicity (Fig. 3, Table 2). The Ki for the high affinity form of the IL-2 receptor was 2.9 × 10−9 M, approximately 8-fold less than the binding affinity of the wild type (Fig. 4, Table 2). DAB389 IL-2(E494K) stimulated DNA synthesis to 3% of the level of 10−8 M rIL-2 (Table 2). The corresponding fusion toxin with the E149S catalytic domain mutation, DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(E494K), was not cytotoxic, possessed a Ki of 6.6 × 10−9 M, and stimulated CTLL-2 [3H]thymidine incorporation by 63% compared to the same concentration, 10−8 M, of rIL-2 (Fig. 4, Table 2). DAB389 IL-2(T439P) (Fig. 1) possessed an IC50 of 6.5 × 10−10 M (Fig. 3, Table 2) and a Ki of 3.5 × 10−8 M (Fig. 4, Table 2). This represents approximately a 300-fold decrease in cytotoxicity and approximately 100-fold less binding affinity when compared to wild type fusion toxin. 10−8 M DAB389 IL-2(T439P) stimulated DNA synthesis in CTLL-2 cells to 5% of the level of 10−8 M rIL-2. The E149S form of DAB389 IL-2(T439P) was not cytotoxic and possessed a Ki of 1.8 × 10−8 M (Table 2). DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(T439P) at 10−8 M stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation by 65% compared to 10−8 M rIL-2. DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) (Fig. 1) possessed an IC50 of 4.3 × 10−9 M and a Ki of 1.9 × 10−8 M (Figure 3:, Figure 4:, Table 2). The cytotoxicity was therefore, approximately 2000-fold less than that of wild type DAB389 IL-2. The Ki was approximately 50-fold less than that of wild type. DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) stimulated CTLL-2 cell DNA synthesis by 2% compared to rIL-2 (Table 2). DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(Q514D) was not cytotoxic, the Ki was 2.0 × 10−9 M and, in contrast to the other noncytotoxic forms of the fusion toxins, at a concentration of 10−8 M, stimulated CTLL-2 [3H]thymidine incorporation to only 8% of the level of 10−8 M rIL-2 stimulation (Fig. 5, Table 2). The above results were of interest as the T439P IL-2 binding domain mutant stimulated DNA synthesis by CTLL-2 cells to a greater extent than one would expect, given the Ki results. Also, the Q514D IL-2 binding domain mutant was less cytotoxic than expected given the Ki results. For this reason, kinetic assays of cytotoxicity were performed. DAB389 IL-2 and DAB389 IL-2(E494K) possessed the same rates of intoxication. DAB389 IL-2(T439P) and DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) exhibited reduced rates of intoxication (Fig. 6). Studies of the relationships between IL-2 and its receptors are important to identify the various functions of IL-2, as well as the structural elements involved with these functions. This information is required for the design of analogs with expanded therapeutic applications. In the present work we use the IL-2-directed fusion toxin, DAB389 IL-2, to further study some amino acid residues previously identified as involved in the processing of IL-2 and its receptors. The purpose of this work was to expand on the knowledge already obtained for these residues, to ascertain how these residues affect the function of the fusion toxin, and to demonstrate the potential of DAB389 IL-2 as a useful agent for the study of ligand-receptor interactions. Buchli and Ciardelli (14.Buchli P. Ciardelli T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 207: 411-415Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) created an IL-2 analog in which a Gln residue at position 126 of IL-2 was changed to an Asp residue. Their results indicated that the Asp-126 mutant stimulated [3]thymidine incorporation in human T-lymphocytes and CTLL-2 cells to a lesser degree than wild type IL-2. The binding affinity of the D126 mutant was greatly decreased, and the loss was due to a disruption of the β/γ receptor subunit interaction. The authors postulated that cross-linking of the β/γ receptor subunits is the likely signaling event for activity of IL-2, and that Gln-126 is involved with binding and cross-linking the subunits, either as a contact position or allosterically. We constructed and studied DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), which contains the analogous mutation in the IL-2 receptor binding domain of DAB389 IL-2. For comparison, we also studied DAB389 IL-2(E494K), a form of DAB389 IL-2 containing a mutation in the IL-2 binding domain that we already knew exerted minimal effects on cytotoxicity. DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) was 2000-fold less cytotoxic than wild type DAB389 IL-2 and possessed a decreased binding affinity, and the corresponding protein with the catalytic domain mutation did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation. The cytotoxicity kinetic assays indicate that DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) inhibited protein synthesis at a slower rate than wild type DAB389 IL-2. The rate of inhibition reflects the rate of binding and toxin entry into the cell cytosol. These results indicate that Gln-514, in the receptor binding domain of DAB389 IL-2, is involved with binding affinity, stimulation of DNA synthesis and rate of toxin internalization. These results are all consistent with the findings for the Gln-126 residue of IL-2. DAB389 IL-2(E494K) was 7-fold less cytotoxic than DAB389 IL-2, probably as a direct result of the 8-fold decrease in binding affinity. The rate of protein synthesis inhibition was the same as for DAB389 IL-2. DA(E149S)B389 IL-2(E494K) stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation, although not as much as wild type, DA(E149S)B389 IL-2. The effects imposed by the Glu-494 mutation to a Lys probably result from structural changes in the IL-2 binding domain of the fusion toxin, leading to the decrease in binding affinity. Chang et al.(15.Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that mutating Thr-51 of IL-2 to a Pro residue resulted in an IL-2 analog with a decreased binding affinity, but the corresponding loss in stimulation of DNA synthesis was much lower than expected. They postulated that either the Thr-51 → Pro mutation resulted in a conformational change that partially mimicked a change required for IL-2 to facilitate the β/γ subunit cross-linking necessary for signaling activation, or the Thr-51 → Pro mutation slowed the internalization rate for the ligand-bound receptor complex, thereby allowing a greater time for the signaling interval. The corresponding residue in the IL-2 receptor binding domain of DAB389 IL-2 was mutated to create DAB389 IL-2(T439P). DAB389 IL-2(T439P) was 300-fold less cytotoxic than wild type and possessed a decreased binding affinity, but still stimulated DNA synthesis as well as the control mutation, DAB389 IL-2(E494K). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of DAB389 IL-2(T439P) (Fig. 2, lane 3) shows this protein was subject to breakdown after freezing and thawing, probably due to conformational effects the Thr-439 → Pro mutation had on the protein. (DAB389 IL-2(T439P) was originally isolated as full-length protein, as shown by gel electrophoretic analysis performed during the purification procedures; data not shown.) DAB389 IL-2(T439P) and DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) both possessed poor binding affinities, but DAB389 IL-2(T439P) was 10-fold more cytotoxic. The fact that DAB389 IL-2(T439P) stimulated DNA synthesis and DAB389 IL-2(Q514D) did not lead us to speculate that the difference in stimulatory effect may account for the difference in cytotoxicity, i.e. stimulation of DNA synthesis leads to enhancement of cytotoxicity. The cytotoxicity kinetics assay for DAB389 IL-2(T439P) showed that this mutant fusion toxin, like DAB389 IL-2(Q514D), possessed a decreased rate of cytotoxicity compared to the wild type and DAB389 IL-2(E494K). This leads to the conclusion that the Thr-439 → Pro mutation in the IL-2 receptor binding domain of DAB389 IL-2, and the corresponding Thr51 to Pro mutation in IL-2, exerted greater than expected stimulatory effects at least partially due to a decreased rate of internalization. The results from these studies confirm and expand on the previous findings for studies performed with IL-2. The Asp residue at position 126 of IL-2 is involved with binding of IL-2 to its receptors. The rate of internalization of the IL-2-receptor complex is decreased and, possibly due to a decrease in β/γ cross-linking, signaling stimulation of DNA synthesis is decreased. Additionally, mutation of this residue in the IL-2 binding domain of the fusion toxin DAB389 IL-2 decreases cytotoxicity to a greater degree than expected, indicating that the loss in stimulation of DNA synthesis, affects cytotoxicity. It appears that the stimulatory effect of the IL-2 binding domain on DNA synthesis enhances cytotoxicity. The Thr residue at position 51 of IL-2 is involved with binding, and this effect may be conformational. The rate of ligand-receptor internalization is decreased when this residue is changed to a Pro, and an increase in DNA stimulation occurs. This effect results in a greater than expected cytotoxicity when the corresponding residue in the IL-2 binding domain of DAB389 IL-2 is mutated."
