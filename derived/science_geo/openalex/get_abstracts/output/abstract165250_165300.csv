Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) mediates mitochondrial proton leak, decreasing ATP production. In the present study, we assessed UCP2's role in regulating insulin secretion. UCP2-deficient mice had higher islet ATP levels and increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, establishing that UCP2 negatively regulates insulin secretion. Of pathophysiologic significance, UCP2 was markedly upregulated in islets of ob/ob mice, a model of obesity-induced diabetes. Importantly, ob/ob mice lacking UCP2 had restored first-phase insulin secretion, increased serum insulin levels, and greatly decreased levels of glycemia. These results establish UCP2 as a key component of β cell glucose sensing, and as a critical link between obesity, β cell dysfunction, and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2121745326,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) plays a key role in insulin and Wnt signaling, phosphorylating downstream targets by default, and becoming inhibited following the extracellular signaling event. The crystal structure of human GSK3β shows a catalytically active conformation in the absence of activation-segment phosphorylation, with the sulphonate of a buffer molecule bridging the activation-segment and N-terminal domain in the same way as the phosphate group of the activation-segment phospho-Ser/Thr in other kinases. The location of this oxyanion binding site in the substrate binding cleft indicates direct coupling of P+4 phosphate-primed substrate binding and catalytic activation, explains the ability of GSK3β to processively hyperphosphorylate substrates with Ser/Thr pentad-repeats, and suggests a mechanism for autoinhibition in which the phosphorylated N terminus binds as a competitive pseudosubstrate with phospho-Ser 9 occupying the P+4 site."
https://openalex.org/W2155186053,"The homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) has dual roles in specifying organ fate and limiting stem cell proliferation in Arabidopsis flowers. We show that the floral identity protein LEAFY (LFY), a transcription factor expressed throughout the flower, cooperates with the homeodomain protein WUSCHEL (WUS) to activate AG in the center of flowers. WUS was previously identified because of its role in maintaining stem cell populations in both shoot and floral meristems. The unsuspected additional role of WUS in regulating floral homeotic gene expression supports the hypothesis that floral patterning uses a general meristem patterning system that was present before flowers evolved. We also show that AG represses WUS at later stages of floral development, thus creating a negative feedback loop that is required for the determinate growth of floral meristems."
https://openalex.org/W2147835081,"Floral meristems and shoot apical meristems (SAMs) are homologous, self-maintaining stem cell systems. Unlike SAMs, floral meristems are determinate, and stem cell maintenance is abolished once all floral organs are initiated. To investigate the underlying regulatory mechanisms, we analyzed the interactions between WUSCHEL (WUS), which specifies stem cell identity, and AGAMOUS (AG), which is required for floral determinacy. Our results show that repression of WUS by AG is essential for terminating the floral meristem and that WUS can induce AG expression in developing flowers. Together, this suggests that floral determinacy depends on a negative autoregulatory mechanism involving WUS and AG, which terminates stem cell maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1992493108,"Tissue-specific overexpression of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) ortholog shaggy (sgg) shortens the period of the Drosophila circadian locomotor activity cycle. The short period phenotype was attributed to premature nuclear translocation of the PERIOD/TIMELESS heterodimer. Reducing SGG/GSK-3 activity lengthens period, demonstrating an intrinsic role for the kinase in circadian rhythmicity. Lowered sgg activity decreased TIMELESS phosphorylation, and it was found that GSK-3 beta specifically phosphorylates TIMELESS in vitro. Overexpression of sgg in vivo converts hypophosphorylated TIMELESS to a hyperphosphorylated protein whose electrophoretic mobility, and light and phosphatase sensitivity, are indistinguishable from the rhythmically produced hyperphosphorylated TIMELESS of wild-type flies. Our results indicate a role for SGG/GSK-3 in TIMELESS phosphorylation and in the regulated nuclear translocation of the PERIOD/TIMELESS heterodimer."

Understanding the earliest phases of Aβ assembly, including prenucleation and nucleation, is essential for the development of rational therapeutic strategies. We have applied a powerful new method, photoinduced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP), to the study of Aβ oligomerization. Significant advantages of this method include an extremely short reaction time, enabling the identification and quantification of short lived metastable assemblies, and the fact that no pre facto structural modification of the native peptide is required. Using PICUP, the distribution of Aβ oligomers existing prior to assembly was defined. A rapid equilibrium was observed involving monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer. A similar distribution was seen in studies of an unrelated amyloidogenic peptide, whereas nonamyloidogenic peptides yielded distributions indicative of a lack of monomer preassociation. These results suggest that simple nucleation-dependent polymerization models are insufficient to describe the dynamic equilibria associated with prenucleation phases of Aβ assembly.

Compelling evidence indicates that factors that increase the production of Aβ (or of particularly amyloidogenic forms of the peptide) or that facilitate deposition or inhibit elimination of amyloid deposits cause Alzheimer's disease or are risk factors for the disease (4Selkoe D.J.

In addition, oligomers may be involved in other amyloid-associated, neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's (6Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R.

These new findings emphasize the importance of elucidating the mechanistic details of the Aβ oligomerization process in order to establish a knowledge base for the development of therapeutic strategies. In vitro studies of Aβ assembly have revealed three main types of oligomers: 1) Aβ-(1–40) oligomers ranging from dimer through hexamer (8Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B.

The precursor-product relationships involving small oligomers, ADDLs, PF, and fibrils are not completely understood. Kinetic studies of the smallest oligomers (8Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M.

Similarly, the relationship between ADDLs, small oligomers, and PF is not clear. Studies of Aβ PF have shown that these assemblies form from low molecular weight Aβ (thought to contain monomers or dimers), have secondary structures rich in β-sheet, and give rise to fibrils (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 22Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y.

Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8972-8980Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Less is known about the biophysical properties of ADDLs (e.g. their equilibrium relationships with other assemblies and their conformational characteristics). In addition, it appears that ADDL formation is restricted to the 42-residue form of Aβ. Studies of the size distribution of Aβ oligomers have not produced a consensus. Evidence for the existence of dimers and higher order oligomers was found initially in studies of synthetic Aβ peptides using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (24Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 460-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of the aggregation state was confounded by the tendency of the peptides to aggregate during the chromatography. In order to overcome this problem, Roher et al. (8Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol.

For example, Aβ dimers and trimers have been observed in material from amyloid plaques when 80% formic acid or 5 m guanidine thiocyanate was used (8Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol.

Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Similar oligomers were produced in vitro upon incubation of synthetic Aβ-(1–42) at pH 7.4 (8Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M.

However, because highly acidic or chaotropic media can dissociate noncovalently associated oligomers and polymers, this approach does not allow determination of the native distribution of oligomers. In addition, although the resolution of SEC is sufficient to resolve monomers, dimers, and possibly trimers, from each other, it cannot resolve higher order oligomers, limiting its ability to provide an accurate determination of the oligomer size distribution. Gel electrophoresis has revealed the presence of small oligomersin vivo (27Pitschke M. Prior R. Haupt M. Riesner D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), in conditioned media of certain cell lines (28Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydell R.E. Teplow D.B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10831-10839Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), and using synthetic peptide preparations (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 32Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the approach is associated with significant interpretive caveats. First, the key principle upon which SDS gel electrophoresis depends is the dissociation of protein complexes and the denaturation of the resulting monomers. Dissociation of oligomeric and fibrillar Aβ by SDS is well known (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Second, SDS may also have the counterintuitive effect of facilitating protein aggregation. Protocols for isolation of both Aβ and prion proteins take advantage of this property (33Joachim C.L. Duffy L.K. Morris J.H. Selkoe D.J. Brain Res. 1988; 474: 100-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 34McKinley M.P. Prusiner S.B. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1986; 28: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and Aβ oligomerization induced by SDS during SDS-PAGE has been shown previously (9LeVine III, H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is thus unlikely that oligomer distributions defined using SDS-PAGE accurately reflect the distributions existing prior to electrophoresis. An equilibrium between Aβ monomers, tetramers, and possibly dimers has been proposed based on analytical ultracentrifugation measurements (32Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This method is highly sensitive but is dependent on the global fitting of the data to multistate association models in order to produce information about oligomer distributions. In fact, these models predicted very similar results for theoretical monomer-dimer, monomer-trimer, or monomer-tetramer equilibria (32Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), making firm conclusions about the true oligomerization state of the peptide difficult. Recently, preparative fractionation of Aβ-(1–40) using noncontinuous gradient ultracentrifugation was found to produce a low molecular weight fraction containing peptide oligomers, but the distribution of oligomers could not be determined (35Ward R.V. Jennings K.H. Jepras R. Neville W. Owen D.E. Hawkins J. Christie G. Davis J.B. George A. Karran E.H. Howlett D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A number of spectroscopic approaches have been applied to the Aβ oligomerization problem. Measurement of the hydrodynamic radius of low molecular weight Aβ using dynamic light scattering suggested that Aβ exists as either a compact dimer or an extended monomer (36Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). However, despite the power of this method for monitoring aggregation noninvasively and in real time, the molecular weight dependence of the scattered light intensity makes quantitative evaluation of oligomeric species difficult when polydisperse populations of Aβ exist. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer data were consistent with Aβ existing as a dimer (10Garzon-Rodriguez W. Sepulveda-Becerra M. Milton S. Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21037-21044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 32Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), yet the low resolution of this method does not allow determination of the actual oligomer distribution. Solution NMR investigations, in contrast, have not revealed the presence of stable oligomers when the spectroscopy was performed in the absence of fluoroalcohols or detergents (37Lee J.P. Stimson E.R. Ghilardi J.R. Mantyh P.W. Lu Y.A. Felix A.M. Llanos W. Behbin A. Cummings M. Vancriekinge M. Timms W. Maggio J.E.

Biol. 2000; 130: 130-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, in solution NMR studies of Aβ, the NMR signal decreases and broadens as soon as aggregation begins; thus, no data can be obtained for oligomers. One approach for stabilizing oligomeric fibril intermediates is chemical cross-linking. Aβ pentamers and hexamers have been observed by SDS-PAGE following glutaraldehyde-mediated cross-linking of Aβ-(1–40) (9LeVine III, H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas no oligomers were observed without cross-linking. However, glutaraldehyde cross-linking is a method normally used for determination of the subunit structure of oligomeric proteins. Artifacts can be produced when the technique is applied to peptides such as Aβ. For example, nonnative interpeptide interactions resulting from the random collision of peptides may be observed, because the length of the cross-linker is large relative to the size of the peptide. This effect is exacerbated due to the relatively long reaction time required for the cross-linking. An ideal method for determining Aβ oligomer size distributions would provide accurate, quantitative “snapshots” of the distributions. Because Aβ assembly is a dynamic, multistep process, the method should be applicable within a time interval significantly smaller than the lifetimes of those stages of the fibrillogenesis process to be studied. In addition, in order to accurately reveal the native oligomerization state of Aβ peptide populations, the method should require no prior peptide modification nor the insertion of exogenous cross-linking agents. A method with these characteristics, PICUP (41Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), has been developed recently. This method enables formation of covalent bonds between closely interacting polypeptide chains without anypre facto chemical modifications (e.g.introduction of chemically or photochemically reactive moieties into the polypeptide chain) and without using spacers. The PICUP cross-linking reaction is induced by very rapid, visible light photolysis of a tris-bipyridyl Ru(II) complex in the presence of an electron acceptor. Following irradiation, a Ru(III) ion is formed, which serves as an electron abstraction agent to produce a carbon radical within the polypeptide (backbone or side chain), preferentially at positions where stabilization of the radical by hyperconjugation or resonance is favored. The radical reacts very rapidly with a susceptible group in its immediate proximity to form a new C–C bond (a more complete discussion may be found in Refs. 41Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar and 42Fancy D.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PICUP thus produces a population of oligomers whose oligomerization states have been “frozen” by covalent cross-linking. Analysis of the “frozen” products reveals the state of aggregation that was present just prior to cross-linking. Here we report the use of PICUP to determine the Aβ oligomer distribution existing during the prenucleation phase of fibril assembly. Aβ-(1–40) was synthesized using automated Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, as previously described (36Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The peptide was purified to >97% purity by reverse-phase HPLC and characterized by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Human pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), human growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF), and human calcitonin (CT) were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Human transthyretin (TTR) was kindly provided by Dr. Maria Saraiva (University of Porto, Portugal). Tris(2,2′-bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) (Ru(Bpy)) and ammonium persulfate (APS) were purchased from Aldrich. Polyacrylamide gels, buffers, stains, standards, and equipment for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Water was double-distilled and then deionized using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Solvents for HPLC were purchased from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. LMW Aβ-(1–40) was isolated using two methods. For most purposes, SEC was used, as described (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, 160 μl of a 2 mg/ml (nominal concentration) peptide solution in Me2SO were sonicated for 1 min using a Branson Ultrasonics bath sonicator (Danbury, CT) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g. The resulting supernate was fractionated on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column using 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The middle of the LMW peak was collected during 50 s and used immediately for PICUP experiments. A 10-μl aliquot was taken for amino acid analysis to determine quantitatively the peptide concentration in each preparation. Typically, the concentration was 30 ± 3 μm. LMW Aβ was also isolated by filtration through a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off filter (43Fezoui Y. Hartley D.M. Harper J.D. Khurana R. Walsh D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Lansbury P.T. Fink A.L. Teplow D.B. Amyloid. 2000; 7: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peptide was dissolved in water and diluted with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to a nominal final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Microcon-10 filters (Millipore Corp.) were washed twice with 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, prior to sample loading. The peptide solution was sonicated for 1 min and then filtered through the prewashed filter at 16,000 × g during 30 min. The filtrate was used immediately for PICUP. The concentrations of LMW Aβ-(1–40) prepared in this way were somewhat lower (23 ± 3 μm) than those of LMW Aβ-(1–40) isolated by SEC. The volumes taken for SDS-PAGE were adjusted according to the concentration found by amino acid analysis, so that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. The photosystem required for performing PICUP experiments was constructed according to the protocol of Fancy and Kodadek (41Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Irradiation was accomplished using a 200-watt incandescent lamp (model 170-D; Dolan-Jenner, Lawrence, MA) and a 35-mm Pentax camera body with an attached bellows. The bellows was used to isolate the reaction tube from external light. The lamp was positioned 15 cm from the reaction tube at the open back of the camera. Unless otherwise stated, the irradiation time was 1 s and was controlled precisely using the camera shutter. In a typical experiment, 1 μl of 1 mm Ru(Bpy) and 1 μl of 20 mm APS in buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) were added to 18 μl of freshly isolated LMW peptide. The mixture was irradiated, and the reaction was quenched immediately with 10 μl of Tricine sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Control peptides were cross-linked under similar conditions. Aliquots from a stock solution of TTR (6.5 mg/ml (470 μm) in H2O) were diluted in either slightly basic buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl) or acidic buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 3.0, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mg/ml of the zwitterionic detergent Z 3–14 (Calbiochem) (44Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar)). The samples were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, and then the protein was cross-linked using 2 μl of 1 mm Ru(Bpy) and 2 μl of 20 mm APS prepared in the same buffer as the protein. The final TTR concentration was 30 μm. Samples were analyzed using 1-mm-thick, 10–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels. Noncross-linked peptide was used as a control for each cross-linked peptide. Peptide bands were visualized by silver staining (SilverXpress, Invitrogen). Gels were air-dried and then scanned with a PowerLook IIIse scanner (Umax, Fremont, CA) in transmissive mode, RGB color, and 600-dot per inch resolution. The scans were saved in TIFF format and imported into One-Dscan (Macintosh version 2.2.4; Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA). The color images were converted to 256 grayscale. A densitometry profile was obtained for each lane, and the relative intensities were calculated by integration of the area under each peak after base-line correction. Although PICUP has been used to cross-link proteins whose native states were homo- or heterocomplexes (41Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 42Fancy D.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,45Fancy D.A. Denison C. Kim K. Xie Y.Q. Holdeman T. Amini F. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), it has not been applied to peptides in the molecular weight range of Aβ. Therefore, a set of cross-linking experiments were carried out to evaluate the utility of the PICUP method for investigating Aβ oligomerization. Particular attention was paid to evaluating the necessity of each of the reaction components and the efficiency of the method. Approximately 0.5 nmol of LMW Aβ-(1–40), freshly isolated by SEC, was irradiated with visible light for 1 s using a ∼2-fold molar excess of Ru(Bpy) and ∼40-fold molar excess of APS. Control reactions were performed without Aβ, Ru(Bpy), APS, Ru(Bpy) and APS, or light (Fig. 1). In the presence of all reaction components, efficient cross-linking took place, leading to the formation of covalently associated oligomers ranging from dimer through hexamer (lane 1). In some cases, the highest observed band was a heptamer. Band intensity differences such as this arose due to differences in the concentration of the LMW Aβ-(1–40) fraction obtained from SEC. Ru(Bpy) and light were required for cross-linking to occur (lanes 3 and6). In the absence of APS, very faint bands corresponding to dimer and trimer were observed (lane 4). Under these conditions, cross-linking probably occurs via singlet oxygen as the electron acceptor (46Zhang X.Y. Rodgers M.A.J. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1995; 99: 12797-12803Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47Tanielian C. Wolff C. Esch M. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1996; 100: 6555-6560Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar), albeit with a much lower efficiency (41Fancy D.A. Kodadek T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 45Fancy D.A. Denison C. Kim K. Xie Y.Q. Holdeman T. Amini F. Kodadek T. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 697-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The fact that no oligomers were detected without irradiation rules out the possibility of observing noncovalent Aβ-(1–40) oligomers that either are not dissociated or are induced in the presence of SDS. Theoretically, the cross-linked oligomers could serve as nuclei for aggregation of free monomers and therefore skew the distribution observed by SDS-PAGE. However, boiling the samples for 10 min with sample buffer containing 8 m urea did not have an effect on the numbers or relative intensities of oligomers observed (data not shown). Thus, the observed bands represent only covalently associated oligomers. Theoretically, if oligomers were in rapid equilibrium with monomers, SEC could produce a singlet LMW Aβ peak that contained both monomers and small oligomers and displayed an aberrant retention time. In fact, the retention times observed for LMW Aβ can vary significantly depending on gel and solvent composition (13Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2"

UEV/Ubc complexes have been implicated in the assembly of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains that act as a novel signal in postreplicative DNA repair and I kappa B alpha kinase activation. The crystal structure of the Mms2/Ubc13 heterodimer shows the active site of Ubc13 at the intersection of two channels that are potential binding sites for the two substrate ubiquitins. Mutations that destabilize the heterodimer interface confer a marked UV sensitivity, providing direct evidence that the intact heterodimer is necessary for DNA repair. Selective mutations in the channels suggest a molecular model for specificity in the assembly of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin signals."
https://openalex.org/W2037206353,"Antioxidant response element (ARE) and nuclear transcription factor Nrf2 are known to regulate expression and coordinated induction of NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics. A cytosolic inhibitor of Nrf2, INrf2, that retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, was cloned and sequenced. Treatment of cells with antioxidants and xenobiotics results in the release of Nrf2 from INrf2. Nrf2 then moves in the nucleus. This leads to the induction of ARE-mediated NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes expression. INrf2 after dissociation from Nrf2 remains in the cytosol. Overexpression of INrf2 repressed ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. Deletion mapping of INrf2 revealed the requirement of KELCH domain (amino acid residues 361–597) and C-terminal region (amino acid residues 598–624) in retention of Nrf2 in the cytosol. Both these regions of INrf2 independently retained Nrf2 in the cytosol leading to the repression of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. These results may indicate that two different regions of INrf2 interact with a single molecule of Nrf2 or two or more molecules of Nrf2 interact with a single molecule of INrf2. The transcription of Nrf2 and INrf2 did not change in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics. This indicated that INrf2 and/or Nrf2 might be post-transcriptionally modified in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics leading to the release of Nrf2 from INrf2 and induction of ARE-mediated NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes expression."

Brain is also protected by ischemic preconditioning and KATP channel openers, and it has been suggested that mitoKATP may also play a key role in brain protection. However, it is not known whether mitoKATP exists in brain mitochondria, and, if so, whether its properties are similar to or different from those of heart mitoKATP. We report partial purification and reconstitution of a new mitoKATP from rat brain mitochondria. We measured K+ flux in proteoliposomes and found that brain mitoKATP is regulated by the same ligands as those that regulate mitoKATP from heart and liver. We also examined the effects of opening and closing mitoKATP on brain mitochondrial respiration, and we estimated the amount of mitoKATP by means of green fluorescence probe BODIPY-FL-glyburide labeling of the sulfonylurea receptor of mitoKATP from brain and liver. Three independent methods indicate that brain mitochondria contain six to seven times more mitoKATP per milligram of mitochondrial protein than liver or heart."

Hall A. GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 89-136Google Scholar). They act as molecular switches and cycle between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) conformations (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2690) Google Scholar). Activation and inactivation of RhoGTPases is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs),1GTPase-activating enzymes, and guanine dissociation inhibitors (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic GEFs for Rho-GTPases share two common sequence motives, the DH (Dbl homology) and the PH (pleckstrin homology) domains, which are responsible for targeting, binding the RhoGTPases, and catalysis of RhoGTPase·GDP → RhoGTPase·GTP exchange (5Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Only the active GTP-bound RhoGTPases can interact with downstream elements of signal transduction cascades mediating the cellular responses. GTPases of the Rho subfamily are central switches in the signaling cascades regulating motility, cellular adhesion, cell shape, cytokinesis, cell contraction, and gene expression (6Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 7Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Each of the RhoGTPases can regulate a specific set of downstream signaling cascades, leading to activation of specific cellular functions (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

For example, in Swiss 3T3 cells, activation of Cdc42 leads to the formation of filopodia, activation of Rac1 induces formation of lamellipodia, and activation of RhoA leads to the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesions (8Ridley A.J.

Thus, selective activation of specific RhoGTPases leads to specific cellular responses. Invasion of the Gram-negative bacterial enteropathogen Salmonella typhimurium (Salmonella enterica subspecies I serovar Typhimurium) into non-phagocytic mammalian cells is studied as a model system for the “trigger mechanism” of bacterial invasion (12Galán J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). For triggering invasion, S. typhimurium employs the specialized type III secretion system encoded in “Salmonellapathogenicity island I” (SPI1) to inject/translocate a set of at least nine different bacterial toxins (called “effector proteins”) into host cells (13Wood M.W.

Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Cdc42 is a key element in theSalmonella-induced signaling cascades leading to transcriptional activation and bacterial invasion: disruption of Cdc42 signaling by transfection with dominant negative Cdc42N17alleles interferes with bacterial invasion and activation of c-Jun kinase and p21-activated kinase (PAK) signaling (23Chen L.M.

Rac1 plays a less prominent role, and disruption of Rac1 signaling merely leads to reduced S. typhimurium invasion rates, whereas inhibition of RhoA signaling does not affect invasion at all (23Chen L.M. Hobie S. Galán J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 2115-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). This suggests that the translocated effector proteins of S. typhimurium may preferentially address certain RhoGTPase signaling pathways. Recent work has demonstrated that S. typhimurium (strain SL1344) relies mainly on a set of three translocated effector proteins to trigger invasion. A triple mutant S. typhimurium strain lacking SopB, SopE, and SopE2 is non-invasive, even though the SPI1 type III secretion system is still fully functional (22Stender S. Friebel A. Linder S.

SopE and SopE2 of S. typhimurium are 69% identical (21Bakshi C.S. Singh V.P. Wood M.W. Jones P.W. Wallis T.S. Galyov E.E. J.

The specificity of SopE and SopE2 for other GTPases of the Rho subfamily has not been studied in detail. If both bacterial virulence factors had different preferences for different RhoGTPases, SopE and SopE2 might provide S. typhimurium with a means to differentially activate specific signaling pathways inside the host cell. In the present study we have analyzed the specificity of SopE and SopE2 for the RhoGTPases Cdc42 and Rac1. Biochemical analyses of purified recombinant proteins and analysis of RhoGTPase activity in infected tissue culture cells revealed that SopE is an efficient activator for both Cdc42 and Rac1 in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, SopE2 efficiently activates Cdc42, but not Rac1. This demonstrates for the first time that expression of two homologous translocated effectors with GEF activity for RhoGTPases allows S. typhimurium to differentially activate specific signaling pathways within host cells. All S. typhimurium strains used in this study have been described (26Mirold S. Ehrbar K. Weissmüller A. Prager R. Tschäpe H. Rüssmann H. Hardt W.-D. J.

Briefly, all proteins used in this study were overexpressed as GST fusion proteins, recovered from bacterial extracts by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and either eluted with 20 mm glutathione (GST, GST-SopE78–240, GST-SopE269–240, GST-Cdc42Hs1–192, and GST-Rac11–191) or cleaved off the column by digestion with thrombin protease (SopE78–240 and SopE269–240, Cdc42Hs1–192 and Ha-Ras) or with factor Xa (Rac11–191). Proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Mr cut-off 8000), snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Due to design of the expression vectors, the proteins carry the following additional amino acids. GST-SopE78–240 carries PGISGGGGGILEFEM between the thrombin cleavage site and Leu-78 of SopE; GST-SopE269–240 carries PGISGGGGGIL between the thrombin cleavage site and Gly-69 of SopE2; SopE78–240 carries the additional N-terminal amino acids GSPGISGGGGGILEFEM; SopE269–240 carries the additional N-terminal amino acids GSPGISGGGGGIL; GST- Rac11–191 carries GIDPGAT between the factor Xa recognition site and Met-1 of Rac1; Rac11–191 carries the N-terminal amino acids GIDPGAT; Ha-Ras carries the additional N-terminal amino acids GS; GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 carries RRASVGSKIISA between the thrombin recognition site and Met-1 of Cdc42. Cdc42Hs1–192 carries the N-terminal amino acids GSRRASVGSKIISA. The expression vector for the GST fusion protein with the Rac1 and Cdc42 binding region (aa 56–272) of human PAK1B was generously provided by E. Sander and J. G. Collard (35Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), and purification of the protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was performed as described (35Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

To remove the associated GDP, GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 bound to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column was washed with 10 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT). Afterward, beads were incubated as a batch in the presence of a 2.5-fold molar excess of fluorescent mGDP (Molecular Probes, Netherlands) for 10 min at 22 °C in buffer D. After addition of excess MgCl2, mGDP·Cdc42Hs1–192 was cleaved off the column material using thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A (4 °C; overnight) and unbound mGDP was removed by gel filtration chromatography. Fractions containing the mGDP·Cdc42Hs1–192 complex were identified by fluorescence spectroscopy, pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore Ultrafree-15, Mr cut-off 8000), snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. For preparation of mGDP·Rac11–191, we devised a new method based on the high stability of the SopE·Rac1 complex (32Rudolph M.G. Weise C. Mirold S. Hillenbrand B. Bader B. Wittinghofer A. Hardt W.-D.

Rac11–191 (in buffer A: 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm DTT) was applied to the column, and unbound Rac11–191 was removed by washing with 10 ml of buffer A. The bound Rac11–191 was eluted as mGDP·Rac11–191 complex using buffer A (20 °C) supplemented with 200 μm mGDP and purified and concentrated as described above for mGDP·Cdc42Hs1–192. Filter binding assays were performed in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) as described (22Stender S. Friebel A. Linder S. Rohde M. Mirold S. Hardt W.-D. Mol.

Association and dissociation reactions involving GST-Cdc42Hs1–192, GST-Rac11–191, SopE78–240, and SopE269–240 were analyzed in buffer E (10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma)) using surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore 2000 system) as described recently (32Rudolph M.G.

Fluorescence measurements were performed at 20 °C in buffer F (40 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) on an Aminco Bowman series 2 fluorescence spectrometer (excitation: 366 nm; emission: 440 nm). Increasing concentrations of either mGDP·Rac11–191 or mGDP·Cdc42Hs1–192 were premixed with SopE78–240 or SopE269–240(final concentrations: 25 nm). Reactions were started by addition of unlabeled GDP (1 mm final concentration), and dissociation of mGDP was recorded as decreased fluorescence at 440 nm. To measure the amounts of Cdc42·GTP and Rac1·GTP in infected tissue culture cells, we performed affinity purification assays as described (35Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P.

Briefly, confluent COS7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5% fetal bovine serum) were infected with S. typhimurium at a multiplicity of infection of 50 bacteria/cell. Cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of GST-fish buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 2 mm MgCl2 supplemented with “complete” protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), lysates were cleared by centrifugation (4000 × g; 4 °C), and the activated Rac1/Cdc42 was recovered by binding to immobilized GST-PAK-cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain fusion protein (see above; 30 min, 4 °C). The beads were washed, and the amount of activated Cdc42·GTP and Rac1·GTP was determined by Western blot analysis using mouse-α-Rac1 (1:2500 in PBS, 5% nonfat milk; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or mouse-α-Cdc42 (1:500, Transduction Laboratories) antibodies. SopE1–240-M45 and SopE21–240-M45 proteins were detected using mouse-αM45 antibody (1:100 in PBS, 5% nonfat milk; Ref. 36Obert S. O'Connor R.J. Schmid S. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 2: 1333-1346Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar), a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-mouse antibody (1:12000; Dianova) and the ECL Plus detection kit, as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HUVECs were grown to confluence in endothelial cell growth medium (Promo Cell, endothelial cell growth supplement/H, 10% FCS) on gelatin-coated plastic coverslips (Thermanox, Nalge Nunc International) as described previously (37Aepfelbacher M. Essler M. Huber E. Sugai M. Weber P.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The culture medium was replaced with serum-free endothelial cell growth medium, and cells were infected with S. typhimurium (multiplicity of infection = 50) for 40 min, washed, fixed with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, 1:20 in PBS, 3% BSA). Bacteria were stained with α-Salmonella O-1,4,5,12(8) antiserum (Difco, 1:400 in PBS, 3% BSA) and a secondary α-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma, 1:250 in PBS, 3% BSA). Coverslips were mounted and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells with obvious rearrangments in the actin cytoskeleton (∼35% of all cells) were evaluated and classified based on their cytoskeletal structure. Previous work had shown that SopE and SopE2 are efficient guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Cdc42 (22Stender S. Friebel A. Linder S. Rohde M. Mirold S. Hardt W.-D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1206-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Rudolph M.G. Weise C. Mirold S. Hillenbrand B. Bader B. Wittinghofer A. Hardt W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30501-30509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity for other RhoGTPases has not been studied in detail. Here, we have compared the GEF-activity of SopE78–240 and SopE269–240 on Rac11–191 and Cdc42Hs1–192. Cdc42Hs1–192, Rac11–191, or Ha-Ras was loaded with [3H]GDP, and we determined the rates of SopE78–240- or SopE269–240-mediated [3H]GDP release using filter binding assays (Fig.1; see “Materials and Methods”). In line with earlier results (22Stender S. Friebel A. Linder S. Rohde M. Mirold S. Hardt W.-D. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1206-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), 1 μmSopE78–240 and SopE269–240 catalyzed fast [3H]GDP release from Cdc42Hs1–192 (Fig. 1,a (●) and d (×)). In contrast, [3H]GDP release from Rac11–191 was much faster in the presence of SopE78–240 (Fig. 1 b, ●) than in the presence of 1 μmSopE269–240 (Fig. 1 e, ×). Therefore, SopE78–240 is a highly efficient GEF for Cdc42Hs1–192 and Rac11–191, whereas SopE269–240 acts equally efficient on Cdc42Hs1–192, but is much less active on Rac11–191 in vitro. To analyze the binding specificity of SopE and SopE2, we have measured the kinetics of formation and dissociation of the complexes between Cdc42 (or Rac1) and SopE2 (or SopE) using surface plasmon resonance. This technique allows one to study binding/dissociation kinetics by measuring the change in mass on the surface of a sensor chip. GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 or GST-Rac11–191 fusion protein (or GST as a control) was bound to a sensor chip, and we measured the kinetics of binding of SopE78–240 (or SopE269–240; 100 nm; Fig.2 a). The observed rates of complex formation between GST-Cdc42Hs1–192, GST-Rac11–191, SopE78–240, and SopE269–240 were dependent on the concentration of the RhoGTPase applied (Fig. 2 b; data not shown). From the binding curves, we calculated the kinetic constants for complex formation (ka) assuming simple one-step bimolecular association reactions:SopE78–240 binds with similar kinetics to GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 and to GST-Rac11–191 (Table I). In contrast, the association rate constant for formation of the GST-Cdc42Hs1–192·SopE269–240 complex is 7-fold higher than for the GST-Rac11–191·SopE269–240 complex.Table ISurface plasmon resonance measurement of the association/dissociation of SopE/SopE2 complexes with GST-Cdc42/GST-Rac1SopESopE2GST-Cdc42 ka (m−1s−1)1.6 ± 0.1 × 1054.0 ± 1.0 × 105 koff (s−1)4.5 ± 1.5 × 10−52.1 ± 0.5 × 10−5 KD (koff/ka) (m)2.8 × 10−105.2 × 10−11GST-Rac1 ka (m−1s−1)3.2 ± 0.5 × 1055.7 ± 1.4 × 104 koff(s−1)1.0 ± 0.2 × 10−41.3 ± 0.4 × 10−4 KD (koff/ka) (m)3.1 × 10−102.3 × 10−9 Open table in a new tab We have also analyzed the dissociation of the complexes (Table I). However, in the absence of GDP, dissociation was slow and the dissociation rate constants are prone to experimental error and should be regarded as rough estimates. The GST-Cdc42Hs1–192·SopE78–240 complex and the GSTRac11–191·SopE78–240complex are roughly equally stable. In contrast, dissociation of the GST-Rac11–191·SopE269–240 complex is 6-fold faster than dissociation of the GST-Cdc42Hs1–192·SopE269–240 complex (Table I). Overall, SopE78–240 binds with very similar equilibrium binding constants (KD =koff/ka) to GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 and to GST-Rac11–191(KD = 3.1 × 10−10m), whereas equilibrium binding of SopE269–240to GST-Cdc42Hs1–192 is 40-fold stronger than equilibrium binding to GST-Rac11–191 (Table I). In line with previous results for the GST-SopE78–240·Cdc42ΔC complex (32Rudolph M.G. Weise C. Mirold S. Hillenbrand B. Bader B. Wittinghofer A. Hardt W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30501-30509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), dissociation of all complexes between GST-RhoGTPases and SopE78–240 or SopE269–240 was accelerated more than 1000-fold in the presence of 20 μm GDP and the dissociation reactions were completed in less than 5 s (data not shown). Identical dissociation curves were obtained when we employed 20 μm GTP (data not shown). However, the dissociation kinetics in the presence of guanine nucleotides were too fast to allow an accurate analysis in order to detect differences between the dissociation rates of the complexes with GST-Cdc42Hs1–192and GST-Rac11–191. We have also analyzed the SopE78–240- and SopE269–240-mediated nucleotide exchange in multiple turnover kinetic experiments usingO-(N-methylanthraniloyl-GDP (mGDP), a fluorescent GDP derivative. The fluorescence of mGDP bound to Cdc42 is 4-fold higher than the fluorescence of unbound mGDP (32Rudolph M.G. Weise C. Mirold S. Hillenbrand B. Bader B. Wittinghofer A. Hardt W.-D. J. Biol.

The kinetics and concentration dependence of mGDP dissociation from Cdc42Hs1–192·mGDP or Rac11–191·mGDP was followed by fluorescence spectrometry (Fig.3). In the SopE78–240-mediated nucleotide exchange reactions, Cdc42Hs1–192·mGDP nucleotide dissociation rate constants (v) reached a plateau at 20–40 μm and the Michaelis-Menten parameters (kcat = 5 ± 1 s−1 and Km = 6 ± 2 μm; Table II) were in the same order of magnitude as those reported for SopE78–240-mediated nucleotide exchange on Cdc42V12·mGDP (kcat = 0.95 ± 0.06 s−1 and Km = 4.5 ± 0.9 μm; Ref. 32Rudolph M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2132661761,"Paclitaxel (PTX), a microtubule-active agent, blocks cell proliferation by inhibiting mitotic progression leading to mitotic and postmitotic arrest and cell death. Here we demonstrate for the first time that very low concentrations of PTX (3–6 nM) can completely inhibit cell proliferation without arresting cells at mitosis. At these low concentrations that are insufficient to inhibit mitotic progression, PTX induced both p53 and p21 causing G1 and G2 arrest in A549. In contrast, low PTX concentrations failed to induce G1 and G2 arrest in A549/E6 cells, that do not express p53. Furthermore, we observed that the levels of p53 and p21 induced by adriamycin and by low concentrations of PTX in A549 cells were comparable. This observation led us to conclude that low concentrations of PTX can induce p53 and p21 sufficiently to cause G1 and G2. Many other cell lines, including HCT116 cells, do not readily upregulate p53 in response to PTX, and therefore undergo exclusively mitotic and postmitotic arrest after PTX treatment. At low concentrations that do not cause mitotic arrest, PTX did not significantly inhibit proliferation of these cells. In HCT116 cells, loss of p53 (HCT/p53−/−) or p21 (HCT/p21−/−) affects both Bax and Bcl-2 expression. In cells lacking p53, levels of Bax and p21 were decreased. In cells lacking p21, levels of wt p53 were highly increased to compensate for the loss of p21. This in turn results in upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 resulting in an increase of the apoptotic Bax/Bcl2 ratio consistent with increased sensitivity of these cells to apoptotic stimuli. High levels of p53 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio can also explain why loss of p21 is rarely found in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1967634425,"Recently, photoaffinity labeling experiments with mouse cell extracts suggested that PARP-1 functions as a surveillance protein for a stalled BER intermediate. To further understand the role of PARP-1 in BER, we examined the DNA synthesis and flap excision steps in long patch BER using a reconstituted system containing a 34-base pair BER substrate and five purified human enzymes: uracil-DNA glycosylase, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, DNA polymerase β, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), and PARP-1. PARP-1 stimulates strand displacement DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase β in this system; this stimulation is dependent on the presence of FEN-1. PARP-1 and FEN-1, therefore, cooperate to activate long patch BER. The results are discussed in the context of a model for BER sub-pathway choice, illustrating a dual role for PARP-1 as a surveillance protein for a stalled BER intermediate and an activating factor for long patch BER DNA synthesis."

Here we investigated the mechanism of starvation-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in terms of tau kinases and Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PP), and the results were compared with those reported in AD brain. During starvation, tau hyperphosphorylation at specific epitopes was accompanied by decreases in tau protein kinase I/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (TPKI/GSK3β), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5), and PP2A activities toward tau. These results demonstrate that the activation of TPKI/GSK3β and cdk5 is not necessary to obtain hyperphosphorylated tau in vivo, and indicate that inhibition of PP2A is likely the dominant factor in inducing tau hyperphosphorylation in the starved mouse, overriding the inhibition of key tau kinases such as TPKI/GSK3β and cdk5.

Lee V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 449-453PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tau can be regulated by many protein kinases and phosphatases in vitro (11Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 13Billingsley M.L. Kincaid R.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These findings, and the changes in kinases and phosphatases observed in AD, suggest that tau hyperphosphorylation in AD brain is likely to be due to an imbalance of the protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation systems. But to date the mechanism of conversion from normal adult tau to hyperphosphorylated tau, the significance of tau hyperphosphorylation in PHF formation, and its relationship to Aβ deposition remain largely elusive. Tau hyperphosphorylation is a physiological reversible response of the brain to stressful conditions like cold water stress 2Y. Okawa, K. Ishiguro, and S. C. Fujita, manuscript in preparation.2Y. Okawa, K. Ishiguro, and S. C. Fujita, manuscript in preparation. (14Korneyev A. Binder L. Bernardis J. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 191: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), heat-shock (15Papasozomenos S.C. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or starvation (16Yanagisawa M. Planel E. Ishiguro K. Fujita S.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Starvation induces decreases in circulating glucose, insulin, and leptin, and increases in corticosterone (17Ahima R.S. Prabakaran D. Mantzoros C. Qu D. Lowell B. Maratos-Flier E. Flier J.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 250-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2668) Google Scholar), and results in a large decrease of glucose in many parts of the brain (18Garriga J. Cusso R. Brain Res. 1992; 591: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Reduced glucose metabolism is associated with certain regions of the brain of probable and preclinical AD subjects (19Minoshima S. Frey K.A. Koeppe R.A. Foster N.L. Kuhl D.E. J. Nucl. Med. 1995; 36: 1238-1248PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reiman E.M. Caselli R.J. Yun L.S. Chen K. Bandy D. Minoshima S. Thibodeau S.N. Osborne D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), and is considered by some as aggravating, if not causative in the development of AD (21Hoyer S. Oesterreich K. Wagner O. J. Neurol. 1988; 235: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These data, combined with the observations that starvation induces tau hyperphosphorylation at many PHF-tau epitopes, and with a regional selectivity analogous to that in AD, suggest that a common mechanism might be mobilized in starvation and AD for tau hyperphosphorylation (16Yanagisawa M. Planel E. Ishiguro K. Fujita S.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Here, we studied the mechanism of tau hyperphosphorylation in the starved mice in terms of protein kinases and phosphatases which, according to previous studies, are either implicated in the generation of tau pathological epitopes in vitro or exhibit altered activity in AD brain, and evaluated the relevance of our findings to AD. The most striking changes concomitant with tau hyperphosphorylation at specific sites were the inhibition of PP2A, concurrent with the inhibition of TPKI/GSK3β, and cdk5 activities toward tau. These results demonstrate that the activation of TPKI/GSK3β and cdk5 is not necessary to obtain hyperphosphorylated tau in vivo, and indicate that tau site-specific hyperphosphorylation in the starved mouse hippocampus involves a complex mechanism in which PP2A inhibition plays a dominant role, overriding the inhibition of key tau kinases such as TPKI/GSK3β and cdk5. Eight to ten-week-old C57BL/6NJcl male mice (Clea Japan, Tokyo) were singly housed in cages with grid floors to deny coprophagy. Food was removed for up to 3 days, but mice were allowed free access to water. Room temperature was 23 °C, and the light period was 08:00–20:00. Animals were handled according to the procedures approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Mitsubishi Kasei Institute of Life Sciences. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, brains immediately removed, and hippocampi were dissected from brains in ice-chilled saline. The tissues were quickly weighed and homogenized in 10 times volume/weight of O+ buffer, modified from O'Farrell's buffer O (22O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.3% (w/v) SDS, 100 μm orthovanadate, 1 μmokadaic acid (OA), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm EDTA). The samples were then placed in boiling water for 5 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (after proper dilution to ensure reagent compatibility) using bovine serum albumin in equivalent buffer as standard. Eighteen μg of protein (determined to fit in the linear range for quantification, calibration data not shown) were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA 85, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). Purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-tau PS199, PT231, PS262, PS396, and PS404 (23Ishiguro K. Sato K. Takamatsu M. Park J. Uchida T. Imahori K. Neurosci.

T1.7, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to TPKI/GSK3β was also reported (28Fujita S.C. Takahashi M. Hasegawa J. Imahori K. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 327Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Purified polyclonal antibodies for mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), phospho-Akt, and Akt (or protein kinase B, PKB) were purchased from New England Biolabs; antibodies to cdk5 (C-8), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) JNK1 (FL), c-AMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) PKAα cat (C-20), PP1 (E-9), and PP2A (C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), anti-active JNK, anti-active MAPK from Promega; anti-PP2Bα from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Monoclonal antibodies AT8 (Innogenetics; specific to tau dually phosphorylated at Ser202 and Thr205 (29Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci.

Lee V.M. Otvos Jr., L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)) were also used. Membrane blocking and antibody incubations were done according to New England Biolab MAPK Immunoblotting Protocol (New England Biolabs number 9910), with appropriate primary and secondary Ig dilutions. Anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The bands were developed with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) or with 4-chloro-1-naphthol and H2O2. The images obtained with the LAS-1000plus Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fuji Film), or scanned from stained membranes, were quantified using a Macintosh version of Fuji Films Science Lab 99 Image Gauge. Statistical analysis of the results was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant ANOVA (p < 0.05) was followed by the Tukey/Kramer test of pairwise multiple comparisons. In all the figures, error bars represent the standard deviation (S.D.), while * and ** indicate significant difference with p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively. LiCl experiments were conducted on 6 groups of 3 mice. At 10:00 on day 1 through day 3, mice of groups 2 and 5 received intraperitoneal injection with 400 μl of 0.3 mNaCl, and mice of groups 3 and 6 were injected with 400 μl of 0.3m LiCl. Mice of groups 4 to 6 were deprived of food at 10:00 on day 2. The mice were sacrificed in the morning of day 4, and hippocampi were taken and analyzed as described above. Mouse hippocampi were homogenized in 5 × volume/weight of ice-chilled RIPA buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Na deoxycholate, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, 1 mm of PMSF, 1 μm okadaic acid), centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, and the protein content of the supernatants was determined. Immunoprecipitation was carried out at 4 °C. Five μl of fresh brain extract were mixed with complexes of T1.7 or Cdk5 (C-8) antibodies coupled to IgG beads (Dynabeads, rat anti-mouse IgG1 M-450 or sheep anti-rabbit M-280, prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions) suspended in 50 μl of cell extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 3 mm benzamidine, 0.05% NaN3, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin and pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm okadaic acid) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on rotating agitator. After washing 3 times with cell extraction buffer, and twice with kinase activity buffer (KAB; 100 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.2, 1 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm okadaic acid), the samples were resuspended in 10 μl of KAB. Kinase activity was measured by phosphorylation of human recombinant tau-441 (Panvera). Ten-μl aliquots of suspension of immunoprecipitated kinases in KAB were mixed with 10 μl of KAB containing 200 μm ATP and 100 μg/ml tau, and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min (for TPKI) or 2 h (for cdk5). The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of O+ buffer and boiling for 5 min. Five μl of this mixture were loaded per lane on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by immunoblotting and band quantification with phospho-tau-specific antibodies as described above. To prepare phosphatase substrate, 1 μl of fresh RIPA buffer extract of hippocampus (10 × v/w) was added to 25 μl of tau phosphorylation mixture (100 μg/ml recombinant tau, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm Mg acetate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. This procedure allows incorporation of 6–7 mol of phosphate/mol of recombinant tau, as determined by a standard radiometric assay using [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. After addition of trichloroacetic acid (1/9, w/v), the supernatant was incubated for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C. The pellet was washed 3 times with 20% trichloroacetic acid, redissolved in the same volume of substrate solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Tween 20) as used during phosphorylation, and dialyzed twice overnight at 4 °C against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Tween 20), to remove any traces of OA. Phosphatase activity was measured by decrease in phosphorylation of tau by the brain extracts as analyzed by Western blotting with anti-phospho-tau antibodies. Mouse hippocampi were homogenized in 5 × volume/weight of ice-chilled phosphatase sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm PMSF) modified from Gong et al. (31Gong C.X. Singh T.J. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, and the protein contents were determined as above. One μl of phosphatase extract was added to 20 μl of phosphatase activity mixture (50 μg/ml phosphorylated tau, 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Tween 20, 1 mmPMSF, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) and incubated at 30 °C for various periods of time. The reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of O+ buffer and boiling for 5 min. Five-μl aliquots were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed as above. PP1 and PP2A activities in the brain extracts toward phosphorylated recombinant tau were assessed after 10 min of incubation at 30 °C by analyzing the dephosphorylation of AT8 epitope in the presence or absence of 5.0 μm OA (inhibitory to PP2A and PP1, Calbiochem), or 1.0 μm inhibitor-2 (PP1-specific inhibitor, Sigma) (32Cohen P.

Phosphorylated tau was incubated in 20 μl of phosphatase activity mixture for 1 h at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 62.5 microunits/μl of recombinant catalytic subunit of PP1 (New England Biolabs). Hippocampal neurons were prepared from 18-day-old embryonic rat brains and cultured as described previously (35Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). These cultures were largely free of non-neuronal cells. Seven days after plating, OA was added to the medium to 100 nm. After 1 h of exposure, the cells were lysed in 5 volumes of RIPA buffer, and the extracts centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 ×g and 4 °C. The supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-tau and anti-protein kinase antibodies. One μg of protein was used for Tau-C, 10 μg for p35 and TPKI PS9, and 2 μg for other antibodies. Immunoblots were reacted with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium (Promega). Batches of three or five young adult mice were starved for up to 3 days and some were refed for up to 1 week after 2 days of starvation. Hippocampal extracts of these mice were individually analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies to protein kinases and phosphatases (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). As described qualitatively (16Yanagisawa M. Planel E. Ishiguro K. Fujita S.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), tau undergoes phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, illustrated here by phosphorylation-dependent anti-tau antibody AT8 (Fig.1, A1 and B1). The two isoforms of rat GSK3, GSK3α and TPKI/GSK3β, are encoded by different genes and share a 85% homology at the amino acid level (36Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). TPKI/GSK3β is a leading candidate protein kinase responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation in AD brains (11Imahori K. Uchida T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 179-188PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme phosphorylates tau at PHF sites Ser199, Thr231, Ser396, Ser404, and Ser413 (23Ishiguro K. Sato K. Takamatsu M. Park J. Uchida T. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 202: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (numbering of amino acids according to the longest human tau (37Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1827) Google Scholar)), but can also phosphorylate other sites in combination with other kinases (38Wang J.Z. Wu Q. Smith A. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of TPKI/GSK3β at Tyr216 is essential for its activity, while phosphorylation at Ser9leads to partial inhibition (39Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Tyr216did not change significantly (Fig. 1, A2 and B2), but starvation induced a dramatic elevation of phospho-Ser9level (Fig. 1, A3 and B2). PKB phosphorylates TPKI/GSK3β at Ser9 (39Cohen P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but the active-PKB epitope was increased only during the first day of refeeding (Fig. 1, A7and B6). Interestingly, the activating phosphorylation of MAPK was transiently increased after 1 day of starvation (Fig. 1,A4 and B3). Activating phosphorylation of JNK, a kinase reported to phosphorylate tau at Thr181, Ser202/Thr205, Thr231, Ser396, and Ser422 epitopes (40Reynolds C.H. Utton M.A. Gibb G.M. Yates A. Anderton B.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1736-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), rose during starvation (Fig. 1, A5 and B4). Levels of phospho-CaMKII immunoreactivity during starvation were not significantly different from control values (Fig. 1, A6 andB5). These observations indicate that, during starvation, MAPK is transiently activated, JNK activated, while TPKI/GSK3β is inhibited.Figure 2Protein levels of tau and protein kinases during starvation.

After 2 days of starvation, the 60-kDa band became prominent, the 56-kDa band weakened while 2 additional bands appeared at 64 and 70 kDa (Fig. 2, A1, lanes 12–16). These mobility shifts reflecting tau phosphorylation (41Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Cairns N.J. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar) were not accompanied by significant changes in total tau protein levels (Fig. 2,B1). Protein levels of TPKI/GSK3β, MAPK, PKB, JNK, or catalytic subunits of PKA, did not show changes that correlated with tau phosphorylation levels (Fig. 2, A2–5, 8 andB2–5, 8). Tau protein kinase II (TPKII) is a heterodimer of a cdk5 catalytic subunit and p25, a 25-kDa regulatory subunit derived proteolytically from p35 (25Uchida T. Ishiguro K. Ohnuma J. Takamatsu M. Yonekura S. Imahori K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 42Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). TPKII phosphorylates tau in vitro at PHF sites Ser202, Thr205, Ser235, and Ser404 (23Ishiguro K. Sato K. Takamatsu M. Park J. Uchida T. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 202: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cdk5 immunoreactivity did not change significantly during starvation (Fig. 2, A7 and B7). Interestingly, p35 displayed a slight upward mobility shift upon starvation, followed by a decrease in intensity, and the strengthening of two lighter bands at 33 and 34 kDa, which are likely to be partial degradation products (Fig. 2,A6). One day of refeeding restored the upper band to its original intensity, and 1 week canceled the band shift (Fig. 2,A6 and B6). The level of p25 was undetectable. Thus, during starvation, the protein levels of tau or the kinases studied did not change, except for cdk5 activator p35 which displayed a slight mobility shift followed by a decrease. As starvation induced a sharp rise in TPKI/GSK3β phospho-Ser9, the role of this enzyme in tau hyperphosphorylation was further studied with an inhibitor of this enzyme, lithium, which reduces tau phosphorylation by inhibiting GSK3 both in vitro and in vivo (43Hong M.

Daily injections of solutions of LiCl or control NaCl were given to fed or starved mice, and hippocampal extracts were analyzed for tau and TPKI/GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 3). Two days of starvation induced increases in tau phosphorylation levels by ∼50 fold at AT8 and PT231, ∼5 fold at Tau-1 and PS262, and ∼65% at PS396, but not at PS199 and PS4"
https://openalex.org/W2048185445,"The Hsp90 dimer is a molecular chaperone with an unusual N-terminal ATP binding site. The structure of the ATP binding site makes it a member of a new class of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes, known as the GHKL family. While for some of the family members structural data on conformational changes occurring after ATP binding are available, these are still lacking for Hsp90. Here we set out to investigate the correlation between dimerization and ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The dimerization constant of wild type (WT) Hsp90 was determined to be 60 nm. Heterodimers of WT Hsp90 with fragments lacking the ATP binding domain form readily and exhibit dimerization constants similar to full-length Hsp90. However, the ATPase activity of these heterodimers was significantly lower than that of the wild type protein, indicating cooperative interactions in the N-terminal part of the protein that lead to the activation of the ATPase activity. To further address the contribution of the N-terminal domains to the ATPase activity, we used an Hsp90 point mutant that is unable to bind ATP. Since heterodimers between the WT protein and this mutant showed WT ATPase activity, this mutant, although unable to bind ATP, still has the ability to stimulate the activity in its WT partner domain. Thus, contact formation between the N-terminal domains might not depend on ATP bound to both domains. Together, these results suggest a mechanism for coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the opening-closing movement of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone. The Hsp90 dimer is a molecular chaperone with an unusual N-terminal ATP binding site. The structure of the ATP binding site makes it a member of a new class of ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes, known as the GHKL family. While for some of the family members structural data on conformational changes occurring after ATP binding are available, these are still lacking for Hsp90. Here we set out to investigate the correlation between dimerization and ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The dimerization constant of wild type (WT) Hsp90 was determined to be 60 nm. Heterodimers of WT Hsp90 with fragments lacking the ATP binding domain form readily and exhibit dimerization constants similar to full-length Hsp90. However, the ATPase activity of these heterodimers was significantly lower than that of the wild type protein, indicating cooperative interactions in the N-terminal part of the protein that lead to the activation of the ATPase activity. To further address the contribution of the N-terminal domains to the ATPase activity, we used an Hsp90 point mutant that is unable to bind ATP. Since heterodimers between the WT protein and this mutant showed WT ATPase activity, this mutant, although unable to bind ATP, still has the ability to stimulate the activity in its WT partner domain. Thus, contact formation between the N-terminal domains might not depend on ATP bound to both domains. Together, these results suggest a mechanism for coupling the hydrolysis of ATP to the opening-closing movement of the Hsp90 molecular chaperone. heat shock protein 90 and 82, respectively geldanamycin high pressure liquid chromatography yeast Hsp90 fragment ranging from amino acid 262 to 709 fragment from amino acid 527 to 709 of Hsp90 the D79N point mutant of Hsp90 fragment 1–210 fragment 1–272 fragment 1–529 fragment 1–599 dissociation constant for the Hsp90 dimer SEC, size exclusion chromatography wild type 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate Hsp901 is an abundant cytosolic protein that belongs to the class of molecular chaperones.

Most of the known in vivo substrates are involved in signal transduction pathways, like tyrosin and serine/threonine kinases, steroid hormone receptors, helix-loop-helix transcription factors, and tumor supressor proteins (6Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Buchner J. Trends. Biochem.

Consistent with the importance of the substrate proteins, Hsp90 was found to be an essential protein in yeast (11Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of Hsp90 is still far from being understood, Hsp90 is thought to maintain an otherwise unstable conformation of the substrate (7Buchner J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). ATP binding and hydrolysis were found to be essential for the function of Hsp90 (12Obermann W.M.J.

(16Csermely P. Kajtar J. Hollosi M. Jalsovszky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely P. Soti C. Mihaly K. Somogyi J. J. Biol.

Experiments using spin-labeled ATP showed that Hsp90 binds ATP weakly (18Scheibel T. Neuhofen S. Weikl T. Mayr C. Reinstein J. Vogel P.D. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18608-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The nucleotide binding site was identified in the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of yeast Hsp90 in the presence of ADP (19Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W.

Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The nucleotide is bound in an unusual kinked conformation with the adenosine base and the ribose buried inside the protein in a cleft. The β-phosphate and probably even more the γ-phosphate of ATP are solvent-accessible in the crystal structure. Interestingly, the crystal structures of the domain in the presence or absence of nucleotide were almost identical (19Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar). The kinetic analysis of the ATPase cycle of Hsp90 revealed that, after ATP binding, a conformational change occurs in Hsp90 that traps the ATP molecule (22Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This trapped ATP molecule proved to be committed to hydrolysis, since it was impossible to exchange it for unbound ATP. This conformational change requires parts of the protein that are C-terminal to the binding site. A conformational change was also observed in the crystal structure of the homologous protein MutL (23Ban C. Yang W. Cell. 1998; 95: 541-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar,24Ban C. Junop M. Yang W. Cell. 1999; 97: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). MutL traps ATP by contacts between the γ-phosphate of ATP and a domain further C-terminal from the ATP binding site. Conformational changes of Hsp90 upon ATP binding were also reported by Prodromouet al. (25Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 16: 4383-4392Crossref Google Scholar). Here, cross-linking data indicate that the N-terminal domains associate in the presence of AMP-PNP, which had been suggested previously based on electron microscopic data (26Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This seems to be a prerequisite for the association of Hsp90 with the co-chaperone p23, which is known to occur after ATP-binding (27Johnson J.L. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24989-24993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Johnson J.L. Corbisier R. Stensgard B. Toft D.O. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 303: 583-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Prodromouet al. (25Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 16: 4383-4392Crossref Google Scholar), fragments of Hsp90 lacking C-terminal domains were found to be considerably less active than wild-type Hsp90. These fragments are thought to be monomeric, in contrast to full-length Hsp90, which is a dimer. The dimerization site was shown to reside in the very C-terminal domain of Hsp90 (30Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 31Jibard N. Meng X. Leclerc P. Rajkowski K. Fortin D. Schweizer-Groyer G. Catelli M.G. Baulieu E.E. Cadepond F. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 247: 461-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the ATPase mechanism of Hsp90, we investigated the importance of dimer formation for the ATPase activity. To this end, we used a set of Hsp90 deletion mutants and analyzed their quaternary structure as well as their ATPase activities. Hsp90 as well as C-terminal fragments were shown to be dimeric with dissociation constants of 0.06 μm. Analysis of the ATPase activity of these fragments demonstrated that the presence of two N-terminal domains is required to stimulate the ATPase activity, since heterodimers formed between C-terminal fragments and the WT protein had diminished ATPase activities. Surprisingly, the stimulation of hydrolysis does not require ATP bound on both sides of the dimer. The presence of two N-terminal domains is sufficient to activate ATP-hydrolysis. Geldanamycin (GA) was a kind gift of the NCI Experimental Drug Division, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). Fragments of yeast Hsp90 were constructed using the plasmid pET28-Hsp82, containing the full-length Hsp82 gene ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae with an N-terminal His tag as a template. All of the polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned into the Qiagen vectors pQE30, resulting in the constructs pQE30-N529, pQE30-N599, and pQE30–527C. In addition, fragments constructed by Scheibel et al. (5Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) were used. The mutagenesis leading to the D79N mutation in full-length Hsp90 was done by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction in N210 using two primers containing the mutation (5′-CCAATACCAGAGTTTCTGATTTCC-3′ and 5′-GGAAATCAGAAACTCTGGTATTGG-3′) and subsequent insertion of this fragment into the full-length gene, using an N-terminalBamHI restriction site and the internal XbaI site. The identity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. His-Hsp90 was expressed in the strain BL21 (DE3) cop+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in LBKan and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. For all other constructs, the strain M15 prep and 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were used. Cells were lysed using a cell disruption system (Constant Systems, Warwick, UK). The fragments and the His-tagged full-length protein were purified on a chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preloaded with 100 mm NiSO4. Cell lysis and loading of the proteins was done in loading buffer (40 mmKPO4, pH 8.0, 400 mm KCl, 6 mmimidazole). The column was washed with washing buffer (40 mm KPO4, pH 8.0, 400 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole) before elution was performed in a step gradient with washing buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. A Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to further purify the proteins. The protein was loaded in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm KCl and eluted with a gradient from 20 to 1000 mm KCl. As a final purification step, a Superdex 200 HiLoad (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Superdex 75 HiLoad (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), depending on protein size, was run in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 5% glycerol. Proteins were stored in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl, 5% glycerol at concentrations of 1.5–6 mg/ml at −70 °C. Far-UV CD spectroscopy was used to confirm the secondary structure of the fragments. Measurements were performed in 40 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at protein concentrations of 200 μg/ml and 20 °C. CD-spectra were collected between 195 and 250 nm on a J-715 spetropolarimeter (Jasco, Groß-Umstadt, Germany). Urea transitions were performed with 20 μg/ml protein and urea concentrations ranging from 0 to 7.5 m in 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm KCl. Changes in tertiary structure were detected by fluorescence measurements on a FluoroMax-2 (Spex, Edison, NJ) at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was set to 280 nm, while emission spectra were collected from 300 to 400 nm. The midpoint of the urea transition was obtained from a plot of the fluorescence signal at 328 nm against the urea concentration. ATPase activities were measured using the EnzCheck phosphate detection kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The assays were performed in 120-μl cuvettes, and the production of phosphate was detected by the increase of absorbance at 360 nm, using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech 40/60 spectrophotometer. The temperature was set to 37 °C. Assays were performed in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP. Typical protein concentrations were 2.5 μm for Hsp90 and up to 50 μm for the less active N-terminal fragments. To subtract Hsp90-contaminating ATPase activities that usually co-purify with Hsp90, GA was added at concentrations of 20 μm for Hsp90 and 100 μm for the N-terminal fragments. The remaining ATPase activity was Hsp90-independent. For the ATPase assays, Hsp90 concentrations were 2.5 μm, while the concentrations of fragments were varied between 1 and 16 μm. To allow equilibration between homodimers and heterodimers, the samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, which was sufficient to reach equilibrium before ATP was added. Again, GA was added later to ensure that the detected ATPase activity is due to ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90. The data analysis of the titration relied on the assumption that the binding of fragments to each other is as effective as the binding of fragments to Hsp90 and the binding of Hsp90 to itself. To correct for potential mistakes in the concentration of one of the proteins, a stoichiometry factor n was incorporated that should, in the case that all of the concentrations are correct, be close to 1.n values smaller than 1 could also indicate that the fragments bind with a lower affinity to Hsp90 than Hsp90 to itself. The resulting equation was as follows,Activity=Acthomo·[Hsp90][Hsp90]+n·[Frag]+Acthet·Equation 1 1−[Hsp90][Hsp90]+n·[Frag]where Acthomo represents the activity of the homodimer and Acthet is the activity of the heterodimer. Cross-linking was performed with glutaraldehyde (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). 20 μl of a 2.4 μm Hsp90 solution containing different amounts of Hsp90-527C were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. 1 μl of a 1:10 solution of 25% glutaraldeyde in reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) was added for 2 min. 2 mm AMP-PNP was included in some reactions as indicated. Then the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8.0. After the addition of 5 μl of 5× Laemmli buffer, the proteins were separated on precast 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and stained with Coomassie Blue (Sigma). Evaluation of the stained gels was performed with the programs LabScan and ImageMaster (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel filtration HPLC was performed on a PU-1580 system (Jasco) with a Superdex 200HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl. The Hsp90 concentrations applied to the column were varied between 12 μm and 9 nm. Protein fluorescence was detected using a FP 1520-S fluorescence detector (Jasco, Victoria, Canada) with excitation at 280 nm and emission at 328 nm. The gain of the photomultiplier was varied to be able to record the signal over a concentration range of three magnitudes. No interaction of monomeric and dimeric species with the column matrix was observed (with the exception of 527C), since the peak shapes were similar for the dimeric and the monomeric species. The analysis of the dissociation curves was based on the assumption that at any time monomeric and dimeric species were in equilibrium. Data were fitted using the Scientist program (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT) and Equation2, ET=ETmono−(ETmono−ETdimer)·[Protein][Protein]+Kd(app)Equation 2 where ET represents the elution time, ETmono is the elution time of the monomeric species, and ETdimer is the elution time of the dimeric species. The obtained dissociation constantKd (app) is only an approximation, since the protein is diluted severalfold during the course of the experiment. To determine the dilution factor, the peak area was analyzed. At the time of injection, the width of the peak was 0.2 min, which corresponds to a 0.1-ml injected volume. Dividing the peak area by 0.2 min gave a signal that is about 7 times as high as the maximum of the originally observed peak. This factor was used as the dilution factor for the calculation of the “real” Kd by dividingKd (app) with the dilution factor. Since the dilution factors were found to be similar for the different Hsp90 fragments, they allowed us to directly compare their association behaviors. All of the following values are already corrected for dilution. Data for sedimentation equilibrium runs were collected on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using a Ti60 rotor. All runs were performed at 4 °C for 48 h with the addition of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to avoid degradation. The protein gradient was detected at 280 nm. Data analysis was done with the program Origin (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Earlier studies showed that truncation mutants of Hsp90 that contain the N-terminal ATP-binding site but lack C-terminal regions are considerably less active in ATP hydrolysis than the WT protein (5Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 22Weikl T. Muschler P. Richter K. Veit T. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2000; 16: 4383-4392Crossref Google Scholar). We were interested in further defining the requirements for full ATPase activity of Hsp90. For this purpose, we designed a set of Hsp90 fragments based on proteolytic digests (5Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), sequence alignments with homologous proteins, and hydropathy plots (Fig. 1). The fragments, varying in size from 210 amino acids (positions 1–210) to 599 amino acids (positions 1–599), were purified, and their structures and stabilities were analyzed using CD spectroscopy and urea transitions. The midpoint of the unfolding transition was between 3 and 5 m urea for all fragments tested. This compares with the stability of the WT protein. All domains used were thus shown to be folded and stable (data not shown). As reported previously, Hsp90-N210 and Hsp90-N272 showed extremely weak ATPase activities, while Hsp90-N529 and, more pronounced, Hsp90-N599 exhibited increased ATPase activities. However, these activities are still by a factor of 6 lower than the ATPase activity of wild-type Hsp90 (Fig.2 A).Figure 2ATPase activity of Hsp90 fragments.ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.5.

However, Hsp90-N529 and Hsp90-N599 showed a reproducible increase of activity with protein concentration (Fig. 2 B). To determine the dissociation constant (Kd) for Hsp90, we decided to employ size exclusion HPLC (SEC-HPLC) with fluorescence detection at different protein concentrations. Using Hsp90 concentrations of 2 nm to 1 μm, only one peak was observed at every concentration tested. However, the elution times differed, depending on the protein concentration used (Fig. 3 A). A shift could be observed starting from an elution time of 20 min (high protein concentration) to an elution time of 23 min (low protein concentration). The presence of one peak at every concentration is consistent with fast equilibration compared with the time scale of the experiment. Using a model that assumes a monomer-dimer equilibrium at every time point of the experiment, we fitted the data points and obtained a Kd of 60 ± 12 nm (Fig.3 B). Having calculated the Kd for WT Hsp90, we were interested to investigate whether C-terminal fragments containing the dimerization site show similar dimerization characteristics. Two fragments were constructed, one ranging from amino acid 262 to 708 (Hsp90-262C) and the other containing amino acids 527–709 (Hsp90-527C). Hsp90-262C gave a transition curve similar to Hsp90 (Fig.3 C). The Kd obtained for Hsp90-262C was 45 ± 12 nm. For Hsp90-527C, no titration curve was obtained, since this protein interacted with the gel filtration matrix, resulting in significant peak broadening. These data clearly show that Hsp90 and its C-terminal fragments are dimeric under conditions used for the ATPase assay, where protein concentrations usually are by at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the dimerization constant of Hsp90. To analyze the quaternary structure of N-terminal fragments, the same experimental setup was used. For Hsp90-N529, no changes in the elution time were observed at concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 5 μm. This, together with equilibrium sedimentation data from analytical ultracentrifugation collected for Hsp90-N529 (data not shown) led us to conclude, that Hsp90-N529 is monomeric within the concentration range tested. Similarly, SEC-HPLC experiments were performed with Hsp90-N599. Here no change in quaternary structure was observed within the concentration range tested (0.04–2 μm) as well (Fig.3 C). Next, we investigated whether the oligomerization properties of the N-terminal fragments change in the presence of ATP. Hsp90-N529 as well as Hsp90-N599 showed a slight concentration dependence in SEC-HPLC experiments (data not shown). In agreement with the ATPase assays (Fig.2 B), which were performed at concentrations between 2 and 10 μm for Hsp90-N599, these data indicate that this could be the beginning of a monomer-dimer transition curve but still be far away from the actual dimerization constant. Taken together, these data suggest that the fragments lacking the C-terminal domain are monomeric and that ATP does not alter the oligomerization behavior of these proteins in the concentration range tested. At higher concentrations, as used in the ATPase assays (Fig.2 B), they dimerize with dimerization constants in the range of 10 μm for Hsp90-N599 and about 70 μm for Hsp90-N530, as obtained by analysis of the concentration-dependent ATPase assays. Having established that the dimerization properties for Hsp90 and its C-terminal fragment 262C are similar, we were interested in whether heterodimers could be obtained by mixing Hsp90 with C-terminal fragments. To detect dimers, we used glutaraldehyde, which is known to efficiently cross-link dimeric Hsp90 (32Jakob U. Meyer I. Bügl H. Andre S. Bardwell J.C. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14412-14419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cross-linking is not complete, since about 20% of monomers can be detected. (Fig. 4). Hsp90-527C was added to WT Hsp90. In the presence of Hsp90-527C, a decrease in the intensity of the dimeric WT Hsp90 band was visible on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while an additional band appeared, consisting of one molecule Hsp90-527C and one molecule Hsp90 (Fig. 4 A). Thus, it is possible to form heterodimers between Hsp90 and its C-terminal fragments in a concentration-dependent manner. Although the concentration of the C-terminal fragment was much higher than the concentration of WT Hsp90 in these experiments, the sample still seems to contain a fraction of homodimers of WT Hsp90. A quantitative densitometric analysis of the scanned SDS gels showed that the cross-linked sample at the highest concentration of 527C-Hsp90 contains about equal concentrations of monomeric Hsp90, dimeric Hsp90, and heterodimeric Hsp90. This might reflect a higher cross-linking efficiency of the homodimer compared with the heterodimer and the C-terminal fragment. Cross-links made in the absence and presence of AMP-PNP did not show detectable differences in the intensity of the heterodimer band (Fig. 4 B). Thus, the N-terminal association induced by AMP-PNP does not contribute significantly to the ability of 527C-Hsp90 to disrupt Hsp90 homodimers. Next, ATPase assays were performed with Hsp90 and Hsp90-527C. Hsp90-527C itself was found to have no ATPase activity. When the concentration of Hsp90-527C was increased in the presence of a constant amount of Hsp90, a decrease in ATPase activity was observed (Fig. 5 A). This result suggests that the heterodimers have reduced ATPase activity. A statistical model that assumes equal probabilities for the formation of homodimers and heterodimers of Hsp90 and Hsp90-527C gave an excellent fit for the data points (Fig. 5 A). The addition of longer C-terminal fragments containing the middle domain in addition to the C-terminal domain (amino acids 262–709;cf. Fig. 1) also led to decreased ATPase activities (Fig.5 B). The inhibition curves were very similar to that of Hsp90-527C, and again the statistical model gave a good fit to the data points. The model used to fit the data points also provides information on the ATPase activity of the heterodimer. The calculated activity of the heterodimer is one-third of the WT activity. This indicates that the ATPase is not completely inhibited in the heterodimer, at least not to the same extent as in the isolated N-terminal domains. The fact that a further increase in the concentrations of N-terminal truncated mutants did not result in additional decrease of the ATPase activity suggests that the end point of the titr"

UVB significantly increased cox-2 gene expression at both protein and mRNA levels. As we reported previously, p38 and ERK were significantly activated after UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells. In addition, treating the cells with p38 inhibitor SB202190 or MEK inhibitor PD98059 specifically inhibited UVB induced p38 or ERK activation, respectively. In this study, we further examined the roles of p38 and ERK in UVB induced cox-2 gene expression in HaCaT cells. We found that SB202190 strongly inhibited UVB induced COX-2 protein expression at different time points and various UVB doses. Furthermore, SB202190 markedly inhibited UVB induced cox-2 mRNA. Our data indicated that ERK did not play a role in UVB induced cox-2 gene expression in human keratinocytes since suppression of ERK did not significantly alter UVB induced increase of COX-2 protein and mRNA. These results suggested, for the first time, that activation of p38 is required for UVB induced cox-2 gene expression in human keratinocytes. Since cox-2 expression plays an important role in UV carcinogenesis, p38 could be a potential molecular target for chemoprevention of skin cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2334932345,"Telomere maintenance is regarded as a key mechanism in overcoming cellular senescence in tumor cells and in most cases is achieved by the activation of telomerase. However there is at least one alternative mechanism of telomere lengthening (ALT) which is characterized by heterogeneous and elongated telomeres in the absence of telomerase activity (TA). We evaluated the prevalence of TA, gene expression of telomerase subunits and ALT in relation to telomere morphology and function in matrix producing bone tumors and in osteosarcoma cell lines and present evidence of a direct association of ALT with telomere dysfunction and chromosomal instability. Telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (T-FISH) in ALT cells revealed elongated and shortened telomeres, partly in unusual configurations and loci, dicentric marker chromosomes and signal-free chromosome ends. Free ends give rise to end-to-end associations and may induce breakage-fusion-bridge cycles resulting in an increased number of complex chromosomal rearrangements, as detected by multiplex-FISH (M-FISH). We propose that ALT cannot be seen as an equivalent to telomerase activity in telomere maintenance. Its association with telomere dysfunction and chromosomal instability may have major implications for tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W2025873925,"Degradation of cellular proteins through ubiquitination is a fundamental strategy for regulating biological pathways. De-ubiquitination, i.e. the removal of ubiquitin from proteins and peptides to which ubiquitin is attached, is catalyzed by processing proteases known as de-ubiquitinating enzymes. We are studying the biology of a family of de-ubiquitinating enzymes, the mammalian ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), some of which appear to play a role in growth control. Given the fact that the modes of regulation of USPs and of their substrate specificity are poorly understood, we decided to attempt the identification of USP interacting proteins. Using the yeast two-hybrid system (2HS), we have isolated a cDNA clone whose product specifically interacts with USP10 but not with other USP baits tested. The isolated clone encodes a protein known to interact with the Ras-GTPase activating protein (G3BP). This interaction was further confirmed by performing a 2HS with G3BP, which led to the isolation of USP10 encoding cDNAs. We validated the interaction between the two proteins by performing in vitro binding assays and immunoprecipitations in human cells. G3BP does not appear to be a substrate of USP10; it rather inhibits the ability of USP10 to disassemble ubiquitin chains. The USP10/G3BP complex appears to co-immunoprecipitate with ubiquitinated species that could be substrates of USP10."

The chemical structure of PIM was then re-evaluated, focusing on the characterization of their lipidic part, defining mono- to tetra-acylated PIM2. The structure of these acyl forms was elucidated using a sophisticated combination of chemical degradations and analytical tools including electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry, electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, and two-dimensional NMR. Finally, the acyl forms were purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and tested for their capacity to induce the granuloma and Natural Killer T cell recruitment. We found that there is an absolute requirement for the molecules to possess at least one fatty acyl chain, but the number, location, and size of the acyl chains was without effect.

Known from the 1940s and fully described by Ballou and colleagues (1Ballou C.E. Vilkas E. Lederer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the 1960s, they were shown to consist of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentamannosides (PIM2 to PIM5). These authors showed unequivocally that in PIM2 the mannosyl units were glycosidically attached at positions 2 and 6 of the myo-Ins ring (2Lee Y.C. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1316-1327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that for the more glycosylated forms, chain elongation occurred on the mannose present at position 6 (3Lee Y.C. Ballou C.E. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, PIM from Mycobacterium smegmatis were reanalyzed in their deacylated form (4Chatterjee D. Hunter S.W. McNeil M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6228-6233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were shown to have a structure based on that defined by Ballou et al. (1Ballou C.E. Vilkas E. Lederer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 69-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but containing six mannosyl residues (PIM6). The structure of the glycosidic part of PIM6 is now unambiguously established and corresponds to Manpα-1→(2-Manpα-1)2→(6-Manpα-1)2→ linked to position 6 of the myo-Ins ring beside the mannosyl residue present at position 2. This structure was confirmed by an NMR spectroscopy strategy applied to deacylated PIM6 (5Severn W.B. Furneaux R.H. Falshaw R. Atkinson P.H. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Concerning the lipidic part of the PIM, the situation is still unclear, although the presence of multiacylated forms of PIM was already reported in 1960s by several authors (6Nojima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1959; 46: 607-620Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Pangborn M.C. McKinney J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1966; 7: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Brennan P. Ballou C.E. J. Biol.

Experentia (Basel). 1968; 24: 851-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) working on different mycobacterial strains. More recently, in a chromatographic and fatty acid quantitation study of mycobacterial lipoglycans, Leopold and Fisher (10Leopold K. Fischer W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 208: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also inferred the existence of multiacylated forms of PIM. However, the sites of attachment of the acyl groups were not established. Re-evaluating the multiacylated nature ofMycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae PIM using FAB-MS analysis, Brennan's group (11Khoo K.H. Dell A. Morris H.R. Brennan P.J. Chatterjee D. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) presented evidence for tri-acylated PIM, assuming an extra fatty acyl group on the C-6 of one of the Manp residue beside the fatty acids already localized on the C-1 and C-2 of the glycerol. Our data derived from an NMR study of a tetra-acylated form of PIM2 (Ac4PIM2) purified fromMycobacterium bovis BCG clearly inferred the previously described positions and demonstrated the fourth acylation site as the C-3 of the myo-Ins (12Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, PIM received a renewed interest due to the fact that PIM2 constitute the anchor motif of two important constituents of the mycobacterial cell walls, namely lipomannans (LM) and lipoarabinomannans (LAM). LAM, ubiquitous in theMycobacterium genus, exhibit a wide spectrum of immunoregulatory effects (for reviews see Refs. 13Chatterjee D. Khoo K.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 14Vercellone A. Nigou J. Puzo G. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 149-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gilleron M. Riviere M. Puzo G. Aubery M. Glycans in Cell Interaction and Recognition: Therapeutic Aspects. Harwood Academic Publishers GmbH, Amsterdam2001: 113-140Google Scholar). It is now clearly established that most of these effects are abolished by alkaline hydrolysis, highlighting the importance of the lipidic part of the anchor. Moreover, PIM6 as well as ManLAM from M. leprae and M. tuberculosis Erdman strain are recognized by human CD4−CD8− α/β T cells in the context of a presentation by CD1b-expressing antigen-presenting cells (16Sieling P.A. Chatterjee D. Porcelli S.A. Prigozy T.I. Mazzaccaro R.J. Soriano T. Bloom B.R. Brenner M.B. Kronenberg M. Brennan P.J. Modlin R.L. Science. 1995; 269: 227-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The high affinity interaction of CD1b molecules with the PIM2 acyl side chains was then established (17Ernst W.A. Maher J. Cho S. Niazi K.R. Chatterjee D. Moody D.B. Besra G.S. Watanabe Y. Jensen P.E. Porcelli S.A. Kronenberg M. Modlin R.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The phosphatidylinositol moiety plays a central role in the process of PIM and ManLAM binding to CD1b proteins. In the mouse, CD1a, -b, and -c genes are missing. The murineCD1d gene is homologous to the CD1d gene in man (18Porcelli S.A. Segelke B.W. Sugita M. Wilson I.A. Brenner M.B. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 362-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This CD1d molecule restricts CD4+ or DN T cells (NK T cells) using a distinctive TCR characterized by an invariant α chain (19Lantz O. Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1097-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 20Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the mouse CD1d1 molecule showed a hydrophobic binding site (22Zeng Z.-H. Castano A.R. Segelke B.W. Stura E.A. Peterson P.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1997; 277: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), and cellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol was proposed as a major natural ligand (23Joyce S. Woods A.S. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. De Silva A.D. Boesteanu A. Balk S.P. Cotter R.J. Brutkiewicz R.R. Science. 1998; 279: 1541-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Due to the homology between CD1a, -b, -c, and -d molecules, it has been hypothesized that mouse CD1d may bind mycobacterial glycolipids. In this respect, a recent study reported that granuloma formation in response to a crude fraction containing PIM from H37RvM. tuberculosis was dependent upon CD1d-restricted T cells (20Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P. Gachelin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). However, no reports have mentioned PIM presentation by CD1d molecules, and the respective roles of the lipidic and carbohydrate moieties in the PIM-induced response was not established. In this study, the chemical structure of PIM isolated from M. bovis BCG was evaluated, focusing on the characterization of the lipidic part of the PIM, thus defining the notion of “acyl forms.” The structure of these acyl forms was elucidated using sophisticated analytical tools such as ESI-MS, ESI-MS/MS, and two-dimensional NMR. Finally, these acyl forms were purified and used in a bioassay aimed at determining the extent of inflammation they caused and the recruitment of NK T cells into the granulomatous lesions they induced. C57BL/6 mice were 6–8-week-old and obtained from IFFA-Credo (L'Arbresle, France). Mice were injected subcutaneously with 50 μg of each molecule and adsorbed onto 12.5 μl of a neutral carrier (Alu-Gel-S, Serva) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The cellular infiltrate at the site of the injection was excised 7 days after the injection and either fixed for histological analysis or used for mRNA characterization. Total RNA was isolated by using the Trizol technique (Life Technologies, Inc.). cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg of total RNA, using a (dT)17 primer, 25 units of RNasin (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 10 units of avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the provided buffer. HGPRT-standardized amounts of cDNA solution were PCR-amplified using Vα14- and Cα-specific primers (20Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P. Gachelin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PCR products were subjected to primer extension using an internal, fluorescently labeled Cα-specific primer (to approach the total usage of Vα14+ segments) or a Jα281-specific primer (to generate only signals due to the NK T-specific rearranged Vα14-Jα281 TCR α chain) (20Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P. Gachelin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Run-off products were analyzed on an automatic sequencer. The size and the intensity of each band were recorded and analyzed using the Immunoscope software (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Typically, a random usage of all rearranged Vα14 α chains is depicted as a series of peaks corresponding to in-frame mRNA, each corresponding to a define length of the CDR3 region. A selected usage of a rearranged chain appears as a peak that distorts the above-mentioned gaussian-like distribution; the NK T-specific Vα14-Jα281 TCR α chain appears as a peak with a CDR3 length of 10 amino acids (20Apostolou I. Takahama Y. Belmant C. Kawano T. Huerre M. Marchal G. Cui J. Taniguchi M. Nakauchi H. Fournie J.J. Kourilsky P. Gachelin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5141-5146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The PIM-containing lipidic extract was obtained during the M. bovis BCG phenolic glycolipids purification (24Vercellone A. Puzo G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7447-7454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1300 g of M. bovis BCG cells were suspended in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and filtered. The cells were suspended four times in the same way. The whole lipid extract was concentrated and partitioned between water and chloroform. The chloroform phase was evaporated, and the residue was suspended in hot acetone and then allowed to deposit overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min (3000 ×g) yielding 40 g of acetone-insoluble phospholipids-containing lipid extract. 7 g of this extract was applied to a QMA-Spherosil M (BioSepra SA, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France) column (3.0 × 20 cm) that was first irrigated with 300 ml of chloroform, chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), methanol in order to elute neutral compounds. Phospholipids were eluted using ammonium acetate containing organic solvents. Indeed, 0.1 m ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) (fraction A) allowed elution of 750 mg of phospholipids (phosphatidyl-myo-inositol dimannosides (PIM2) essentially); 0.2 mammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) (fraction B) was subdivided into two fractions as follows: the 1st volumes allowed elution of 440 mg of phospholipids (cardiolipids essentially) and the next ones allowed elution 160 mg of phospholipids (mixture of phosphatidyl-myo-inositol di- (PIM2) and hexa- (PIM6) mannosides), and finally, 0.2 m ammonium acetate in methanol (fraction C) allowed elution of 55 mg of phospholipids (PIM6 essentially). Repeated lyophilizations were necessary to eliminate ammonium acetate salts. 170 mg of the fraction A containing mainly PIM2 were first flash-chromatographed on a silicic acid column (2.5 × 30 cm) (KG60, 230–400 mesh, Merck) using chloroform/methanol/water, 90:10:1; 80:20:1; 70:30:2; 70:30:4; 60:35:6 successively as eluents. PIM2Ac4 was recovered in the 70:30:2 fraction (12Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fractions corresponding to 70:30:4 (60 mg) and 60:35:6 (70 mg) elutions were independently re-chromatographed by isocratic silicic flash chromatography (2 × 23 cm columns) unsuccessfully in order to purify more polar PIM2. Then, 20 mg of the fraction A were then loaded in 0.1m ammonium acetate solution containing 25% (v/v) propanol-1 to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (20 × 1.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was first eluted with 50 ml of equilibration buffer and then with a linear propanol-1 gradient from 25 to 50% (v/v) (125 ml each) in 0.1m ammonium acetate solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/h. The fractions were collected each 15 min. 20 μl of each fraction was dried and submitted to acidic hydrolysis (100 μl trifluoroacetic acid 2 m, 2 h, 110 °C). The hydrolysates were dried, reconstituted in water, and then analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography for mannose content. Purification was checked by TLC, on aluminum backed plates of silica gel (Alugram Sil G, Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) using as migration solvent chloroform/methanol/water, 60:35:6 (v/v/v). A sulfuric anthron spray and a Dittmer-Lester spray were used to detect carbohydrates containing lipids and phosphorus-containing lipids, respectively. 200 μg of PIM were treated with 200 μl of anhydrous acetic acid/acetic anhydride, 1:1, v/v at 110 °C for 12 h. The reaction mixture was dried under stream of nitrogen and was submitted to acetylation. The mixture was dissolved in acetic anhydride/anhydrous pyridine, 1:1, v/v at 80 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was dried under stream of nitrogen. 200 μl of chloroform/methanol, 9:1, v/v was added, and negative mass spectrum was recorded using about 100 μl of mixture. The remaining mixture was dried and then dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol, 9:1, v/v, and positive mass spectrum was recorded. The same protocol was applied using perdeutero-acetylated reactives in order to deduce the number of acetates present after peracetylation. The phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v) in order to be analyzed in ESI-MS. ESI-MS analyses were carried out on a Finnigan Mat TSQ 700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan Mat, San Diego, CA) system. The negative ESI mode (spray potential 3.8 kV, temperature of heated capillary 140 °C) and positive ESI mode (spray potential 4.8 kV) were used. The mass spectra were obtained by direct infusion using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus) at a flow rate of 4 μl min−1. Full scan spectra were acquired in the ion peak centroid or profile modes over the mass/charge range of 200–3000 at 2.0–3.0 s. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments were based by conducting collision-induced dissociation occurring in the radio-frequency-only collision cell of the triple quadrupole at a collision energy of 40–80 eV. Argon was used as collision gas in the range of 1.5–2.5 mtorr. At least 15 scans were accumulated and averaged. Data analysis was controlled by a DEC α 500 data system. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-500 spectrometer equipped with an Aspect X32 computer. PIM samples were dissolved in CDCl3 (99.96% purity)/CD3OD (99.8% purity)/D2O (99.97% purity), 70:30:2, v/v/v and analyzed at 20 °C. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France. Samples were analyzed in a 200 × 5 mm 535-PP NMR tubes. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of CDCl3 (δH/trimethylsilyl 7.27 and δC/trimethylsilyl 77.7). All two-dimensional NMR data sets were recorded without sample spinning, and data were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode using the time-proportional phase increment (25Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn (HOHAHA) spectrum was recorded using MLEV-17 mixing sequence of 30 ms (26Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). 1H-13C correlation spectra were recorded in the proton-detected mode with a Bruker 5-mm1H-broadband tunable probe with reversal geometry. The1H-13C and 1H-31P single-bond correlation spectra (HMQC) were obtained according Bax's pulse sequence (27Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). The GARP sequence (28Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) at the carbon or phosphorus frequency was used as a composite pulse decoupling during acquisition. Multiple-bond 1H-13C correlation spectra (HMBC) (29Bax A. Summers M.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2093-2094Crossref Scopus (3258) Google Scholar) were processed in the magnitude mode. The pulse sequence used for1H-detected heteronuclear relayed spectra (HMQC-HOHAHA) was that of Lerner and Bax (30Lerner L. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 69: 375-380Google Scholar).

Chem. 1993; 268: 3168-3179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM) are known to be found in the acetone-insoluble fraction of the chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) mycobacterial extract. The contaminating neutral compounds were eliminated by QMA anion exchange chromatography, irrigated with neutral eluents (chloroform, followed by chloroform/methanol, 1:1, v/v and then by methanol). Then, phospholipids were eluted with ammonium acetate-containing organic solvents resulting in three fractions, namely A–C. Each fraction was adsorbed onto alum and injected subcutaneously to C57BL/6 mice. Seven days after the injection, the cell infiltrates were excised, sectioned, and stained. The three fractions generated a highly organized and large granuloma with a central core of neutrophils surrounded by a densely organized rim of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibroblasts (Fig.1, E and F), mimicking the granuloma observed during murine tuberculosis. By contrast, a minor inflammatory reaction was evidenced in PBS-injected (control mice) (Fig. 1, A and B) or deacylated PIM-injected mice (Fig. 1, C and D). In this case, the lesions were found to predominantly contain a disordered array of macrophages and neutrophils with few lymphocytes. This points to the absolute requirement for the lipidic moiety of PIM to cause a granulomatous lesion. In order to characterize the PIM composition of the different fractions, the fractions A–C were analyzed by ESI-MS in negative mode. The attribution of the deprotonated molecular ions (M − H)− (Fig. 2) was based on the predominant fatty acids as deduced from GC/MS analysis (not shown),i.e. palmitic (C16), tuberculostearic (C19), and stearic (C18) acids. ESI-MS mass spectrum of fraction A predominantly showed ions corresponding to Ac3- (m/z 1415.0) and Ac4- (m/z 1653.5, 1681.5 and 1695.5) PIM2 in addition to the diacyl form of phosphatidylinositol (Ac2PI atm/z 852.3) (Fig. 2 a). Fraction B mass spectrum (Fig. 2 b) appeared more complex showing predominantly the previously described Ac3- and Ac4PIM2 and also Ac3- (m/z 2063.7) and Ac4- (m/z 2302.1, 2330.2, and 2344.2) PIM6. Finally, the mass spectrum of fraction C (Fig. 2 c) was dominated by one peak atm/z 2063.7 assigned to (M − H)− of Ac3PIM6, beside the other acyl forms of PIM6. In summary, tri- and tetra-acylated forms of PIM2 and PIM6 appeared to be the most abundant PIM acyl forms of M. bovis BCG, and they may be responsible for the granuloma formation. The first attempt to go further in the separation of the different PIM acyl forms consisted of using silicic phase flash-chromatography with chloroform/methanol/water in different proportions as eluents. By using this strategy, Ac4PIM2 was purified from fraction A with a chloroform/methanol/water, 70:30:2, v/v/v eluent (12Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The fractionation of the more polar PIM2 and PIM6was unsuccessful using successive isocratic flash chromatographies. An alternative approach was developed, using hydrophobic interaction chromatography on an octyl-Sepharose column, with propanol-1 as eluent. Fig. 3 shows the purification of PIM2 acyl forms issued from fraction A. The different acyl forms were eluted at propanol-1 concentrations ranging from 25 to 50% and separated into 5 sub-fractions according to the mannose content profile. Each sub-fraction (I–V) was collected and analyzed by ESI-MS and NMR. The negative ESI mass spectrum of fraction IV is dominated by the signal at m/z1414.2 (Fig. 4 c), beside peaks at m/z 1442.2 and m/z 1456.2 assigned to deprotonated molecular ions of tri-acylated forms of PIM2 (Ac3PIM2). Indeed, the most abundant (M − H)− ions at m/z 1414.2 (77%) characterized Ac3PIM2 esterified by 2C16,1C19, whereas the ions at m/z1442.2 (14%) and 1456.2 (9%) corresponded to PIM2esterified by 1C16,1C18,1C19 and 1C16,2C19, respectively. The acylation sites on PIM were determined previously to be at both positions of the Gro, the C-3 of the myo-Ins unit and the C-6 of the Manp unit linked to C-2 of the myo-Ins thanks to an NMR strategy based on two-dimensional1H-31P and 1H-13C experiments applied on the tetra-acylated form of PIM2(Ac4PIM2) (12Gilleron M. Nigou J. Cahuzac B. Puzo G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The NMR strategy we applied on each acyl form is presented briefly below. From the1H-31P HMQC experiment, the prochiral H-3 and H-3′ Gro protons and the myo-Ins H-1 were easily assigned. Then, the remaining myo-Ins and Gro protons were observed on the two-dimensional 1H-31P HMQC-HOHAHA spectrum (Fig. 5) and were assigned from their multiplicity and chemical shifts (32Wang Y. Hollingsworth R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and with the help of the1H-1H HOHAHA spectrum. The different chemical shifts typified the presence or absence of an acyl appendage. For example, a di-acyl-Gro could be evidenced by an H-2 around 5.10 ppm (and H-1 around 4.00/4.25 ppm) (32Wang Y. Hollingsworth R.I. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 242-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and a lyso-Gro should then be assigned by an H-2 around 3.75 ppm and H-1 around 3.95 ppm. These attributions were then supported by the downfield resonance of the lyso-Gro 31P resonance compared with that of di-acyl-Gro31P. Likewise, the downfield shift of themyo-Ins H-3 of about 1 ppm signed a C-3 acyl appendage. The fourth position of acylation, the C-6 of the Manp, was checked with the 1H-13C HMBC spectrum, which implied the complete determination of 1H and13C chemical shifts achieved by1H-1H HOHAHA and 1H-13C HMQC analysis. When this position is acylated, the H6/H6′ was deshielded from 3.47/3.64 to 3.95/4.07 ppm. This analytical approach applied to Ac3PIM2(Fig. 5 c) revealed that the major acyl form corresponded to PIM with two fatty acids on the Gro and one fatty acid on the Manp unit. This was definitively demonstrated from the1H-13C HMQC spectrum, by the chemical shifts of the H-2 (4.98 ppm) and C-2 (70.6 ppm) of Gro and of the H-6/H-6′ (4.07/3.95 ppm) and C-6 (63.6 ppm) of Manp. Beside this species, another one was observed in less quantity. Indeed,1H-13C HMQC and 1H-1H HOHAHA highlighted the presence of an acylated (δH-34.55) myo-Ins and of a mono-acyl Gro with the acyl appendage present in position 2 as evidenced by the H-2 at δ 4.80. The nature of the fatty acids esterifying the different sites was investigated by mass spectrometry using two different approaches. The first consisted in obtaining fragment ions produced by ESI-MS/MS from each pseudo-molecular ion of the native molecule (Fig.6 a). Concerning Ac3PIM2, Fig. 6 b shows the MS/MS spectrum obtained from the precursor ions at m/z 1414.2 (2C16/C19 PIM2). This spectrum is dominated by peaks at m/z 297.7 and 255.6 assigned to C19 and C16 carboxylate fatty acids, respectively. In addition, in the high mass range loss of C16 gives the fragment ions at m/z 1158.5 which in turn led to the fragment ions m/z 860.0 by loss of C19. More interesting are the fragment ions C atm/z 803.9 highlighting a C16 acyl appendage on the C-6 of the Manp residue. Moreover, this spectrum shows fragment ions at m/z 433.4 corresponding to mono-C19 Gro and at m/z 153.2 (not shown) corresponding to deacylated Gro. So, ESI-MS/MS fragmentations did not appear suitable in order to establish accurately the structure of the fatty acid located on the glycerol moiety. Moreover, in the case of Ac4 forms, C ions were unable to discriminate between acyl appendages located on the Manp and themyo-Ins. A second approach was then developed, consisting in ESI-MS analysis of the acetolysis reaction products of each PIM2 species. Acetolysis cleaves the phosphoglycerol linkage without altering the fatty acid esters, leading to two entities as follows: the dimannosyl-inositol phosphate moiety (Man2-Ins-P) (I, II) and the acyl-glycerol residue (III) (Fig.7 a). The dimannosyl-inositol phosphate moiety was observed in negative mode as [M − H]− ions I and II, and the acyl-glycerol residue was analyzed in positive mode in the presence of ammonium acetate as [M + NH4]+ ions III. The acetolysis reaction produces two populations of dimannosyl-inositol phosphate moieties, one with o"
https://openalex.org/W1967742670,"TRAIL has gained much attention for its specific induction of apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells. This phenomenon has been explained thus: that cancer cells dominantly express death receptors while normal cells express decoy receptors. However, recent reports have shown that some cancer cell lines are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis despite the absence of decoy receptors and the presence of death receptors. This suggested the existance of an inhibitory factor. We herein showed that NF-κB is a key molecule underlying the TRAIL-resistant mechanism in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. We observed that NF-κB is constitutively activated in resistant cell lines. Forced expression of antisense cDNA of IκBα, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, in TRAIL-sensitive cell lines with a low NF-κB activity result in constitutive activation of NF-κB and resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Adenoviral expression of a stable form of IκBα in the TRAIL-resistant cell lines induced apoptosis. These data suggest that RCC can be classified into two subsets: TRAIL-sensitive RCC with a low NF-κB activity and TRAIL-resistant RCC with constitutively activated NF-κB. In the former group TRAIL can be a treatment option, while in the latter group a molecular approach targeting NF-κB appears to be a promising therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2021464180,"The bis-indole indirubin is the active ingredient of the Traditional Chinese Medicine recipe Danggui Longhui Wan used against chronic myelocytic leukemia. We have previously shown that indirubins are potent inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3. We here investigated the anti-mitotic properties of this class of compounds using the cell permeable indirubin-3′-monoxime and the HBL-100 cell line. Indirubin-3′-monoxime reversibly arrests asynchronous HBL-100 cells in G2. This arrest is not accompanied by any significant change in expression of the major cell cycle regulators. However indirubin-3′-monoxime inhibits the phosphorylation of consensus CDK phosphorylation sites as well as of nucleolin at a specific CDK1/cyclin B phosphorylation site, suggesting a direct action on the mitotic CDK1/cyclin B. When indirubin-3′-monoxime is added to HBL-100 cells synchronized in M phase by nocodazole, cells undergo an endoreplication leading to an 8n DNA content. As soon as indirubin-3′-monoxime is washed away, these polyploid cells become aneuploid and later die from necrosis. This mechanism of endoreplication followed by cell death may contribute to the anti-tumour properties of indirubins."
https://openalex.org/W2165571932,"Drosophila fasciclinII (fasII) mutants perform poorly after olfactory conditioning due to a defect in encoding, stabilizing, or retrieving short-term memories. Performance was rescued by inducing the expression of a normal transgene just before training and immediate testing. Induction after training but before testing failed to rescue performance, showing that Fas II does not have an exclusive role in memory retrieval processes. The stability of odor memories in fasII mutants are indistinguishable from control animals when initial performance is normalized. Like several other mutants deficient in odor learning, fasII mutants exhibit a heightened sensitivity to ethanol vapors. A combination of behavioral and genetic strategies have therefore revealed a role for Fas II in the molecular operations of encoding short-term odor memories and conferring alcohol sensitivity. The preferential expression of Fas II in the axons of mushroom body neurons furthermore suggests that short-term odor memories are formed in these neurites."

In this study, we analyzed the association of this novel neuronal γ2 subunit with Ca2+ channels of rabbit brain, and the function of the γ2 subunit in recombinant neuronal Ca2+ channels expressed inXenopus oocytes. Our results showed that the γ2 subunit and a closely related protein (called γ3) co-sedimented and co-immunoprecipitated with neuronal Ca2+ channel subunits in vivo. Electrophysiological analyses showed that γ2co-expression caused a significant decrease in the current amplitude of both α1B(α12.2)-class (36.8%) and α1A(α12.1)-class (39.7%) Ca2+channels (α1β3α2δ). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of the γ2 subunit on current amplitude were dependent on the co-expression of the α2δ subunit. In addition, co-expression of γ2 or γ1 also significantly decelerates the activation kinetics of α1B-class Ca2+channels. Taken together, these results suggest that the γ2 subunit is an important constituent of the neuronal Ca2+ channel complex and that it down-regulates neuronal Ca2+ channel activity.

Understanding the molecular regulation of these channels is critical for the comprehension of these major physiological phenomena. The high voltage-activated Ca2+channel (called Ca2+ channel hereafter) consists of at least three subunits: a main subunit, α1, and two auxiliary subunits, β and α2δ (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev.

Understanding Ca2+ channel regulation at the molecular level will lead to further comprehension of the mechanisms underlying these neurological disorders. In this study, by showing the association of the γ2subunit with other Ca2+ channel subunits, we provide biochemical data supporting the hypothesis that the γ2subunit is a component of the neuronal Ca2+ channel complex. Furthermore, by examining the function of the γ2subunit using recombinant α1B- and α1A-class Ca2+ channels expressed inXenopus oocytes, we show that the novel γ2subunit participates in the modulation of the neuronal Ca2+channels. Our results demonstrate that the γ2 subunit is a part of the neuronal Ca2+ channel complex and has a α2δ-dependent inhibitory effect on the channel activity. We thank Drs. T. P. Snutch and D.

Their products had nine putative transmembrane regions, exhibited 43–60% identity and 62–84% similarity with the bovine subunit a1 isoform, and retained 11 amino acid residues essential for yeast V-ATPase activity (Leng, X.

Transgenic and immunofluorescence analyses revealed that these genes were strongly expressed in distinct cells;vha-5 was strongly expressed in an H-shaped excretory cell,vha-6 was strongly expressed in intestine,vha-7 was strongly expressed in hypodermis, andunc-32 was strongly expressed in nerve cells. Furthermore, the vha-7 and unc-32 genes were also expressed in the uteri of hermaphrodites.

However, functions of the a1 anda2 isoforms remain unclear.We have focused on V-ATPase in Caenorhabditis elegans to elucidate the functional roles of acidic compartments in development and cellular processes. Analysis involving RNA interference indicated that V-ATPase is indispensable for early embryogenesis of the worm (22Oka T. Fuati M. J. Biol.

In this study, we identified four genes (vha-5, vha-6, vha-7, and unc-32) for subunit a isoforms, the first example of four distinct subunit a isoforms in higher eukaryotes. These genes are expressed in a cell-specific manner during worm development. The unc-32 gene is essential for embryogenesis, and vha-5 and vha-6 are required for larval development, whereas vha-7 is dispensable. The results suggest that V-ATPases with these isoforms generate specific acidic compartments required for development.DISCUSSIONWe have identified four genes (vha-5, vha-6, vha-7, andunc-32) encoding subunit a isoforms of C. elegans V-ATPase.

Futai, manuscript in preparation. implying that at least four a isoforms are required in higher eukaryotic cells.Transgenic analysis involving the GFP reporter gene showed that the four isoforms were expressed in a cell-specific manner. Thevha-5, vha-6, vha-7, and unc-32 promoters were highly active in the H-shaped excretory cells, intestine, hypodermis, and nerve cells, respectively. It is noteworthy that thevha-7 and unc-32 genes were strongly expressed in the uteri of hermaphrodites. Thus, the two gene products may have maternal roles in embryonic development.VHA-5 was expressed predominantly in H-shaped excretory cells in adult worms. The excretory cells are thought to function in osmoregulation and the excretion of toxic and metabolic waste (39Nelson F.K. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1983; 82: 156-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 40Nelson F.K. Riddle D.L. J. Exp. Zool. 1984; 231: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Hedgecock E.M. Culotti J.G.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1858-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We found that the cells preferentially express the genes for the 16-kDa proteolipid (vha-1, vha-2, and vha-3), the 23-kDa proteolipid (vha-4), and the C (vha-11) subunits of V-ATPase (22Oka T.

These findings suggest that VHA-5 may be a critical isoform of V-ATPase with regard to its function in the H-shaped excretory cells. Furthermore, RNA interference analysis of thevha-5 gene showed that the progenies of worms injected withvha-5 dsRNA died specifically at the L2 stage. These results imply that further development of L2 larvae requires excretory functions driven by V-ATPase with the VHA-5 isoform.V-ATPases localized on plasma membranes are known to generate an acidic environment outside the cells. They are found in osteoclasts (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), renal intercalated cells (8Brown D. Breton S. J. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that the mouse subunit a3 isoform plays important roles in determining the V-ATPase localization in the plasma membrane. We have shown that VHA-6 is distributed specifically on the apical surface of intestinal cells in larval and adult worms. The amino-terminal region (1–140 amino acid residues) of VHA-6 was sufficient for localization on the apical surface (data not shown). We speculate that VHA-6 is a key subunit for the sorting of V-ATPase to the plasma membrane to acidify the intestinal lumen.RNA interference analysis showed that vha-6 dsRNA arrested larval development at the L1 stage. The L1 larvae did not die immediately but remained alive for up to a week. This phenotype is similar to that of L1 larvae starved after hatching. The L1 larvae of the vha-6 dsRNA-injected worms took up a fluorescence dye, DiO, into their intestinal lumen (data not shown), indicating thatvha-6 dsRNA did not affect the food intake ability of the worms. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that defective proton transport into the intestinal lumen due to the lack of VHA-6 arrested worm development at the L1 stage. These results suggest that luminal proton transport by V-ATPase with the VHA-6 isoform may be essential for the digestion of food or uptake through microvilli. In this regard, V-ATPase localized on the plasma membrane in the larval midgut of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is important to generate a proton gradient (44Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D. Sacchi V.F. Harvey W.R. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In contrast to the intestinal expression during postembryonic development, VHA-6 was found predominantly in P2 cells in 4-cell embryos. The expression continued to a germ line cell lineage (P3, P4, Z2, and Z3 cells) until the comma stage. Introduction ofvha-6 dsRNA abolished this embryonic expression (data not shown). Although Z2 and Z3 cells finally proliferate to germ cells (45Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 241-270Google Scholar), VHA-6 was not observed in the gonads or spermathecia of adult worms. It should be noted that the expression of VHA-5 and VHA-6 changed dramatically between the embryonic and larval stages. As described above, expression of VHA-6 was observed in germ line cells during the embryonic stage but was observed in intestinal cells in larvae and adults. This suggests the requirement of different acidic compartments during development. Vacuolar-type proton-translocating ATPases (V-ATPases)1 are large complex enzymes consisting of at least 13 subunits (1Graham L.A. Powell B. Stevens T.H. J. Exp.

In yeast, two a isoforms (Vph1p and Stv1p) have been found in vacuolar and Golgi/endosomal membranes, respectively (10Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J.

We have focused on V-ATPase in Caenorhabditis elegans to elucidate the functional roles of acidic compartments in development and cellular processes. Analysis involving RNA interference indicated that V-ATPase is indispensable for early embryogenesis of the worm (22Oka T. Fuati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29556-29561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified four genes (vha-5, vha-6, vha-7, and unc-32) for subunit a isoforms, the first example of four distinct subunit a isoforms in higher eukaryotes. These genes are expressed in a cell-specific manner during worm development. The unc-32 gene is essential for embryogenesis, and vha-5 and vha-6 are required for larval development, whereas vha-7 is dispensable. The results suggest that V-ATPases with these isoforms generate specific acidic compartments required for development. DISCUSSIONWe have identified four genes (vha-5, vha-6, vha-7, andunc-32) encoding subunit a isoforms of C. elegans V-ATPase. These gene products exhibit high identity and completely retain 11 amino acid residues essential for the activity, assembly, or intracellular sorting of yeast V-ATPase (32Leng X.H. Manolson M.F.

Futai, manuscript in preparation. implying that at least four a isoforms are required in higher eukaryotic cells.Transgenic analysis involving the GFP reporter gene showed that the four isoforms were expressed in a cell-specific manner. Thevha-5, vha-6, vha-7, and unc-32 promoters were highly active in the H-shaped excretory cells, intestine, hypodermis, and nerve cells, respectively. It is noteworthy that thevha-7 and unc-32 genes were strongly expressed in the uteri of hermaphrodites. Thus, the two gene products may have maternal roles in embryonic development.VHA-5 was expressed predominantly in H-shaped excretory cells in adult worms. The excretory cells are thought to function in osmoregulation and the excretion of toxic and metabolic waste (39Nelson F.K. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. J. Ultrastruct.

We found that the cells preferentially express the genes for the 16-kDa proteolipid (vha-1, vha-2, and vha-3), the 23-kDa proteolipid (vha-4), and the C (vha-11) subunits of V-ATPase (22Oka T.

These findings suggest that VHA-5 may be a critical isoform of V-ATPase with regard to its function in the H-shaped excretory cells. Furthermore, RNA interference analysis of thevha-5 gene showed that the progenies of worms injected withvha-5 dsRNA died specifically at the L2 stage. These results imply that further development of L2 larvae requires excretory functions driven by V-ATPase with the VHA-5 isoform.V-ATPases localized on plasma membranes are known to generate an acidic environment outside the cells. They are found in osteoclasts (7Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

We have shown that VHA-6 is distributed specifically on the apical surface of intestinal cells in larval and adult worms. The amino-terminal region (1–140 amino acid residues) of VHA-6 was sufficient for localization on the apical surface (data not shown). We speculate that VHA-6 is a key subunit for the sorting of V-ATPase to the plasma membrane to acidify the intestinal lumen.RNA interference analysis showed that vha-6 dsRNA arrested larval development at the L1 stage. The L1 larvae did not die immediately but remained alive for up to a week. This phenotype is similar to that of L1 larvae starved after hatching. The L1 larvae of the vha-6 dsRNA-injected worms took up a fluorescence dye, DiO, into their intestinal lumen (data not shown), indicating thatvha-6 dsRNA did not affect the food intake ability of the worms. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that defective proton transport into the intestinal lumen due to the lack of VHA-6 arrested worm development at the L1 stage. These results suggest that luminal proton transport by V-ATPase with the VHA-6 isoform may be essential for the digestion of food or uptake through microvilli. In this regard, V-ATPase localized on the plasma membrane in the larval midgut of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is important to generate a proton gradient (44Castagna M. Shayakul C. Trotti D.

A. 1998; 95: 5395-5400Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In contrast to the intestinal expression during postembryonic development, VHA-6 was found predominantly in P2 cells in 4-cell embryos. The expression continued to a germ line cell lineage (P3, P4, Z2, and Z3 cells) until the comma stage. Introduction ofvha-6 dsRNA abolished this embryonic expression (data not shown). Although Z2 and Z3 cells finally proliferate to germ cells (45Schedl T. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 241-270Google Scholar), VHA-6 was not observed in the gonads or spermathecia of adult worms. It should be noted that the expression of VHA-5 and VHA-6 changed dramatically between the embryonic and larval stages. As described above, expression of VHA-6 was observed in germ line cells during the embryonic stage but was observed in intestinal cells in larvae and adults. This suggests the requirement of different acidic compartments during development. We have identified four genes (vha-5, vha-6, vha-7, andunc-32) encoding subunit a isoforms of C. elegans V-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W2330251340,"To determine if TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human prostate tumor cells was suppressed by bcl-2, we compared the levels of apoptosis induced by recombinant human TRAIL in pairs of isogenic cell lines that do or do not express bcl-2. Three human prostate tumor cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP) and their bcl-2-expressing counterparts were tested for their susceptibility to TRAIL. Cells were exposed to TRAIL in the presence of cycloheximide which acted as a sensitizer. Apoptosis was induced rapidly in PC3 and DU145 neo-control transfected cells, whereas induction in LNCaP required 24 h. All three cell line variants expressing bcl-2 were resistant to the apoptotic effects of TRAIL. Caspase 3 and 8 activation was also detected in the neo control cells after treatment with TRAIL, demonstrating the rapid activation of the caspase cascade similar to that seen with other death receptors. Bcl-2 overexpression in these cells blocked activation of these caspases, suggesting that bcl-2 expression of human cancer cells may be a critical factor in the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL."
https://openalex.org/W2057072329,"This study was aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms by which ceramide inhibits telomerase activity in the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. C6-ceramide (20 µm) caused a significant reduction of telomerase activity at 24 h as detected using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, and this inhibition correlated with decreased telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) protein. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Northern blot analyses showed that C6-ceramide significantly decreased hTERT mRNA in a time-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays demonstrated that the binding activity of c-Myc transcription factor to the E-box sequence on the hTERT promoter was inhibited in response to C6-ceramide at 24 h. These results were also confirmed by transient transfections of A549 cells with pGL3-Basic plasmid constructs containing the functional hTERT promoter and its E-box deleted sequences cloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Further analysis using RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that c-Myc protein but not its mRNA levels were decreased in response to C6-ceramide at 24 h. The effects of ceramide on the c-Myc protein were shown to be due to a reduction in half-life via increased ubiquitination. Similar results were obtained by increased endogenous ceramide levels in response to nontoxic concentrations of daunorubicin, resulting in the inhibition of telomerase and c-Myc activities. Furthermore, the elevation of endogenous ceramide by overexpression of bacterial sphingomyelinase after transient transfections also induced the inhibition of telomerase activity with concomitant decreased hTERT and c-Myc protein levels. Taken together, these results show for the first time that both exogenous and endogenous ceramides mediate the modulation of telomerase activity via decreased hTERT promoter activity caused by rapid proteolysis of the ubiquitin-conjugated c-Myc transcription factor.

Furthermore, the elevation of endogenous ceramide by overexpression of bacterial sphingomyelinase after transient transfections also induced the inhibition of telomerase activity with concomitant decreased hTERT and c-Myc protein levels. Taken together, these results show for the first time that both exogenous and endogenous ceramides mediate the modulation of telomerase activity via decreased hTERT promoter activity caused by rapid proteolysis of the ubiquitin-conjugated c-Myc transcription factor. telomerase reverse transcriptase telomerase RNA moiety telomerase-associated protein reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction telomere repeat amplification protocol 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid electrophoretic mobility shift assay cycloheximide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis green fluorescent protein Without their telomeric caps, human chromosomes undergo chromosome fusion or degradation (1Greider C.W.

Those telomeric ends comprise long tandem repeats of hexanucleotide 5′-TTAGGG-3′, and since conventional DNA polymerases cannot replicate the 5′-end of linear DNA, telomeres shorten as a function of each cell division in normal human somatic cells. This telomeric shortening is believed to control cellular senescence (5Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar, 6Hastie N.D.

Telomeres are primarily controlled by telomerase, which is composed of a catalytic protein subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT),1 a stably associated RNA moiety (hTR), and telomerase-associated protein (TEP1) (8Nakamura T.M.

Science. 1997; 275: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the disruption of telomere maintenance by inhibiting telomerase limits proliferation of human cancer cells due to excessive telomere erosion (14Counter C.M. Hahn W.C. Wei W. Caddle S.D. Beijersbergen R.L. Lansdorp P.M. Sedivy J.M. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14723-14728Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 15Hahn W.C.

It has been shown also that telomerase is not active in most somatic tissues, whereas it is activated in the majority of cancer-derived cell lines and malignant tumors, suggesting that telomerase plays an important role in cell immortalization and tumorigenesis (16Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6585) Google Scholar, 17Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 787-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2418) Google Scholar). It has been shown that telomerase activity is present in the majority of lung cancers and not detectable in normal lung tissues (18Lee J.C. Jong H.S. Yoo C.G. Han S.K. Shim Y.S. Kim Y.W. Lung Cancer. 1998; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Sarvesvaran J. Going J.J. Milroy R. Kaye S.B. Keith W.N.

Commun. 1997; 237: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the presence of telomerase activity in tumors of non-small cell lung cancer patients correlates with a high cell proliferation rate and an advanced pathologic stage (22Albanell J. Lonardo F. Rusch V. Engelhardt M. Langenfeld J. Han W. Klimstra D. Venkatraman E. Moore M.A. Dmitrovsky E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been suggested that telomerase activity is one of the most important prognostic factors in lung cancer patients and that telomerase can be an important target to develop novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of lung cancers. The regulation of telomerase is well studied. The overexpression of hTERT mRNA parallels telomerase activity in nearly all tumor cells whereas it is repressed in most normal human somatic cells (16Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 622-625PubMed Google Scholar), and overexpression of hTERT in telomerase negative cells is sufficient for enzyme activity, suggesting that the activation of hTERT transcription may potentially be the dominant rate-limiting step in telomerase regulation (12Nakayama J. Tahara H. Tahara E. Saito M. Ito K. Nakamura H. Nakanishi T. Ide T. Ishikawa F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Recently, the promoter region of hTERT has been cloned and sequenced (24Cong Y.S. Wen J. Bacchetti S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 25Takakura M.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 232: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that c-Myc activates hTERT transcription by directly interacting with its promoter, leading to increased promoter activity (28Wang J. Xie L.Y. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J.

Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that c-Myc and SP1 cooperate to induce hTERT promoter activity in several human cancer cell lines (32Kyo S. Takakura M. Taira T. Kanaya T. Itoh H. Yutsudo M. Ariga H. Inoue M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Also, other cellular factors such as p53, Rb, protein phosphatase 2A, and Akt have been implicated in the regulation of telomerase in various cancer cells (33Li H. Zhao L.L. Funder J.W. Liu J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16729-16732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 34Li H. Zhao L. Yang Z. Funder J.W. Liu J.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13085-13090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of telomerase regulation in human lung cancers remain unknown. In the past decade, sphingolipids have been shown to play an important role in signal transduction, mediating stress responses, and regulation of growth (36Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kim M.Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that ceramide is involved in mediating important cellular activities such as induction of cell differentiation, growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis in some human cancer cells (38Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Ceramide has been shown to regulate the activity of various biochemical and molecular targets, including serine/threonine phosphatases of the protein phosphatase 2A and PP1 families designated as CAPP, KSR, PKC-ζ, Rb, JNK, phospholipase D, Akt, and effector caspases, and to down-regulate c-Myc (38Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that endogenous ceramide is involved in mediating the specific inhibition of telomerase activity in response to ceramide, and that this inhibition is independent of apoptotic cell death in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells (39Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of ceramide-induced telomerase inhibition in A549 cells are unknown. Therefore, in this study we attempted to identify the molecular mechanisms triggered by ceramide that are involved in the regulation of telomerase activity. The A549 human lung carcinoma cells were obtained from Dr. Alice Boylan (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Cells were maintained in growth medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 ng/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cell permeable and biologically active short chain ceramide (C6-ceramide) was obtained from the Synthetic Lipid Core at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina. Telomerase activity in cell extracts were measured by the PCR-based telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) using TRAPeze kit (Intergen, Gaithersburg, MD) which includes a 36-base pair internal control to allow quantification of activity as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells, grown in 6-well plates, were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in 1 × CHAPS lysing buffer for 30 min on ice. Then 50–100 ng of proteins from each cell extract were analyzed in the TRAP reaction. The cell extracts were added directly to the TRAP reaction mixture containing dNTPs, TS primer (6 × 105 cpm), reverse primer mixture, andTaq polymerase. Then, the extended telomerase products were amplified by two-step PCR (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s) for 27 cycles. The telomerase activity in each sample was quantitated by measuring the ratio of the 36-base pair internal standard to the extended telomerase products as described by the manufacturer using ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). The mRNA levels of hTERT and hTR were analyzed by RT-PCR and Northern blotting as described previously (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 41Ogretmen B. Ratajczak H. Gendel S.M. Stark B.C. Cancer Lett. 1996; 102: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). One µg of total RNA, isolated using a RNA isolation kit (Qiagen), was used in reverse transcription reactions as described by the manufacturer. The resulting total cDNA was then used in the PCR to measure the mRNA levels of hTERT and hTR using primers and conditions as described (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels β-actin and rRNA were used as internal controls (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Linear amplification cycles were determined separately for each gene as described elsewhere (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For Northern blotting, 4–5 µg of total RNA separated on 0.8% denaturing agarose gels was transferred to a nylon membrane and then was probed with the hTERT-specific32P-labeled PCR product as described previously (41Ogretmen B. Ratajczak H. Gendel S.M. Stark B.C. Cancer Lett. 1996; 102: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), except that Express Hybridization Buffer (CLONTECH) was used for blotting. Nuclear extracts (8–10 µg of protein) isolated as described previously (42Flamigni F. Faenza I. Marmiroli S. Stanic I. Giaccari A. Muscari C. Stefanelli C. Rossoni C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) from cells grown in the presence or absence of various concentrations of C6-ceramide were preincubated in 15 µl of binding buffer (42Flamigni F. Faenza I. Marmiroli S. Stanic I. Giaccari A. Muscari C. Stefanelli C. Rossoni C. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) containing 1.5 µg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) with or without oligonucleotides used as competitors at 25 °C for 15 min. Then, 3–5 ng of 5′-end labeled DNA probes (60,000 cpm) were added to the reaction and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. End labeling of DNA fragments with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed using T4 DNA kinase (Promega). Competitor double stranded oligonucleotides (Santa Cruz) were used at 10–100-fold molar excess. The reaction mixtures were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography (43Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 5′-3′ sequences of double stranded oligomers, which were synthesized and annealed by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA), contained the hTERT-E-box and its mutated form: hTERT-E-box, GGGCTAGCGCGCTCCCCACGTGGCGGAGGGAAAGCTTCC; hTERT- Mut-E, GGGCTAGCGCGCTCCCTTT GTGGCGGAGGGAAAGCTTCC. The pGL3-Basic plasmids containing hTERT promoter fragments (26Horikawa I. Cable P.L. Afshari C. Barrett J.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 826-830PubMed Google Scholar) spanning −279 to +5 which is the minimal functional core promoter designated as pBTdel-279, the fragment −149 to +5 which lacks the functional c-Myc recognition sequence designated as pBTdel-149, or the fragment −211 to +40 which contains two c-Myc binding sequences designated as p2XEB were all kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Barrett (NIEHS, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC). The cells were co-transfected with 2.5–3 µg/well of hTERT reporter plasmids constructed as described above and pSV-β-galactosidase control plasmid (Promega) by a cationic liposome-mediated transfection method using the Effectine transfection kit (Qiagen) for 6–8 h as described by the manufacturer. After the transient transfectants were recovered in fresh media for 18 h, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using Promega's luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme assay systems as described by the manufacturer. The light intensity of the luciferase reactions measured in the lysates of the transient transfectants were normalized to their β-galactosidase activity, used as an internal control (43Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44Ogretmen B. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The effects of protein synthesis inhibition using cycloheximide (CHX) on c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cell lines were investigated as described previously (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The optimal CHX concentrations that inhibit 95% of the protein synthesis in each cell line (grown in 24-well plates) were determined by measuring the total incorporation of [35S]methionine (4 µCi/ml) into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable macromolecules by scintillation counting (40Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The cells then were pretreated with CHX at its optimum concentrations for various time points in the absence or presence of C6-ceramide before immunoprecipitation or Western blotting as described below. The protein levels of c-Myc and hTERT were detected by Western blot analysis. In short, total proteins (20–50 µg/lane) were separated by 5–15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad), blotted onto an Immobilon membrane, and c-Myc, Max, Mad1, and hTERT proteins were detected using 1 µg/ml of rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Myc, Max, and Mad1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-hTERT (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) antibodies, and peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:2500). The proteins were visualized using the ECL protein detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. Equal loading were confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE strips cut from gels containing 50 µg of protein/lane of each sample prior to blotting. Subconfluent cells (70–80% confluent) were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in methionine-free growth medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 2–4 h. Following phosphate-buffered saline washes, the cells were resuspended in 1 × CHAPS or RIPA buffer and frozen at −80 °C (45Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Equal trichloroacetic acid counts of the lysates were used for immunoprecipitations as described previously (45Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). After the lysates were precleared with 20–50 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Life Technologies) at 4 °C for 16 h, they were incubated at 4 °C for 2–4 h with 20 µg of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) which recognize hTERT or Mad1. The immunoprecipitation of c-Myc was performed using the agarose-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz). The immunocomplexes were then precipitated using protein A-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed with the CHAPS buffer to remove nonspecific binding. Then the immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The full-length b-SMase cDNA fragment was cloned into the pEGFPN1 mammalian expression vector system (Invitrogen) upstream of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) sequence as described (46Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of A549 cells were performed using the effectene transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The half-life of c-Myc protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation, Western blot, or pulse-chase analysis with [35S]methionine labeling following CHX treatments as described previously (47Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 48Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8058-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) using anti-c-Myc antibodies (Santa Cruz). The half-life of the proteins was measured by densitometry of x-ray films. To analyze the ubiquitin conjugates, c-Myc protein was immunoprecipitated with the protein A-agarose-conjugated rabbit polyclonal c-Myc antibody followed by Western blotting using goat polyclonal anti-ubiquitin or c-Myc antibodies after CHX treatments. The involvement of proteasome 26S in the degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated c-Myc was examined by using lactacystin (Calbiochem) which is a specific inhibitor of proteasome, and E-64 (trans- epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which is a cysteine protease inhibitor, used as a control, prior to CHX treatments in the experiments described above. Our previous results showed that endogenous ceramide mediates the inhibition of telomerase activity in response to daunorubicin, and that this inhibition is independent of cell toxicity or apoptotic cell death (39Ogretmen B. Schady D. Usta J. Wood R. Kraveka J.M. Luberto C. Birbes H. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24901-24910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, Fig.1A shows that telomerase activity was slightly decreased after 3 h treatment with exogenously applied C6-ceramide (20 µm), whereas treatment of the cells with C6-ceramide for 6 and 24 h resulted in a significant inhibition of telomerase activity by about 50 and 85%, respectively. Moreover, C6-ceramide had no effect on telomerase activity in vitro (data not shown), demonstrating that ceramide is indirectly involved in the inhibition of telomerase. Recently, we have developed a new method for immunoprecipitation of hTERT protein (Fig. 1 B) in A549 cell extracts using the hTERT rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by lysing the cells in 1 × CHAPS buffer (45Kraveka J.M. Schady D. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 291: 166-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 B, this antibody successfully recognized the 132-kDa hTERT protein using our protocol. These results also showed that hTERT protein level was significantly decreased in response to C6-ceramide treatment at 20 µm for 24 h compared to that of untreated A549 cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2and 1, respectively). To examine the effects of ceramide on the transcription of hTERT, A549 cells were treated in the absence or presence of 20 µm C6-ceramide for various time points (0–24 h), and the mRNA levels of hTERT, hTR, rRNA, and β-actin were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR. The linearity of amplification cycles in each PCR was established using32P-labeled primers (data not shown) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As seen in Fig. 1 C, hTERT mRNA level was significantly decreased in response to C6-ceramide. This down-regulation of hTERT mRNA by C6-ceramide was time dependent: a slight decrease in hTERT mRNA was observed after 3 and 6 h C6-ceramide treatment (about 5 and 14%, respectively), whereas its mRNA level was significantly reduced at 24 h in response to C6-ceramide (about 84%) compared with that of controls (Fig. 1 C, second panel from the top, lanes 1–4). On the other hand, C6-ceramide had no effect on the mRNA levels of hTR (Fig. 1 C, third panelfrom the top). The mRNA levels of β-actin and rRNA were used as internal controls, and their levels were similar in each sample (Fig. 1 C). Similar results, which showed that hTERT mRNA expression was inhibited by about 25 and 90% after 6 and 24 h C6-ceramide treatment, were obtained by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 D, lanes 2–5). The RNA of Wi-38 lung fibroblast cell line which do not express hTERT was used as a negative control in Northern blotting (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). In an attempt to determine whether the inhibition of hTERT mRNA expression in A549 cells by ceramide was associated with decreased DNA binding activity of c-Myc/Max transcription factor, we performed EMSA using a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the E-box motif (CACGTG) on the hTERT promoter sequence spanning −173 to −152 region as a probe as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The cells were treated with 20 µm C6-ceramide for 24 h, nuclear extracts were isolated, and 5 µg of the extracts were used in EMSAs. As seen in Fig. 2A, our results show that the DNA binding activity of c-Myc in A549 nuclear extracts (lane 1) was greatly inhibited by C6-ceramide treatment (lane 4). The specificity of c-Myc binding to the E-box region of the hTERT promoter wa"

Systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been used to assess residues 142–164 in transmembrane helix 4 and 402–421 in transmembrane helix 7 of the M1muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Several inward-facing amino acid side chains in the exofacial parts of transmembrane helices 4 and 7 contribute to acetylcholine binding. Alanine substitution of the aromatic residues in this group reduced signaling efficacy, suggesting that they may form part of a charge-stabilized aromatic cage, which triggers rotation and movement of the transmembrane helices. The mutation of adjacent residues modulated receptor activation, either reducing signaling or causing constitutive activation. In the buried endofacial section of transmembrane helix 7, alanine substitution mutants of the conserved NSXXNPXXY motif displayed strongly reduced signaling efficacy, despite having increased or unchanged acetylcholine affinity. These residues may have dual functions, forming intramolecular contacts that stabilize the receptor in the inactive ground state, but that are broken, allowing them to form new intramolecular bonds in the activated state. This conformational rearrangement is critical to produce a G protein binding site and may represent a key mechanism of receptor activation.

This conformational rearrangement is critical to produce a G protein binding site and may represent a key mechanism of receptor activation. muscarinic acetylcholine receptor acetylcholine transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors (−)-N-methylscopolamine (−)-3-quinuclidinyl benzilate phosphoinositide Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs)1 belong to the rhodopsin-like family of 7-transmembrane (7-TM) receptors. Agonists bind to these receptors at the extracellular end. This leads to the binding and activation of a G protein at the intracellular face. These receptors are characterized by the possession of a particular set of evolutionarily conserved amino acids, mostly located in the 7-TM helices, implying that they may share a common mechanism of activation. However, the topography of the binding pockets and the conformational changes related to agonist-induced receptor activation are incompletely understood. In recent studies on the M1 mAChR, we have identified ligand contact residues in TM 3 (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), 5 (2Allman K. Page K.M. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and inferred a strip of residues in TM 3 contributing to the activated state of the M1 mAChR by using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, or cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the ground state of rhodopsin at 2.8 Å (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) has provided a framework for modeling the mAChRs and allowed us to interpret most of the information obtained by mutagenesis studies on the M1 mAChR. In the initial projection map of rhodopsin (5Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), TM 4 appeared as an outlier of the helical bundle, with a large lipid-exposed surface and few polar residues. Consequently, its function has received little attention. However, a recent photo-activated chromophore cross-linking study of rhodopsin has shown a flip-over of the ionone ring from the neighborhood of TM 6 to TM 4 during receptor activation, implying that a substantial movement of TM 3 and/or 4 may accompany receptor activation (6Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have also indicated the potential importance of TM 4 in ligand binding and G protein recognition (7Waugh D.J.J. Zhao M.M. Zuscik M.J. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11698-11705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Heitz F. Holzwarth J.A. Gies J.-P. Pruss R.M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hibert M.F. Guenet C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35546-35552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As in other 7-TM receptors, particular residues in TM 7 of the mAChRs are known to contribute to ligand binding (10Matsui H. Lazareno S. Birdsall N.J.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 88-98PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no comprehensive and systematic study of this domain of TM 7 has been performed. TM 7 also contains the very highly conserved NPXXY motif. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to explore the functions of individual residues in this motif in several receptors (12Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 84: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This has led to two hypotheses. Reciprocal mutagenesis has suggested that the conserved Asn 7.50 (using the nomenclature of Ballesteros and Weinstein) may form part of a hydrogen bonding network involving the equally conserved Asp 2.50 and Asn 1.50 (12Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar, 17Perlman J.H. Colson A. Wang W. Bence K. Osman R. Gershengorn M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11937-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, a combinatorial histidine substitution study has provided evidence that Asn 7.50 may form part of a conserved set of Van der Waals contacts with TM 3 and 6, which stabilize the receptor in the ground state (13Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5682-5686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present alanine-scanning study was carried out in the context of a larger study of the TM domains of the M1 mAChR (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Allman K. Page K.M. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), allowing the importance of individual residues to be compared, and evaluated in a receptor-wide context. Replacement of individual amino acids by alanine, which deletes the side-chain beyond the β-carbon with little perturbation of the overall structure of the receptor, allows primary categorization of the role of each amino acid. Important positions can be analyzed by the construction of further mutants. Taken with previous studies, the results now allow us to identify the majority of the residues in the acetylcholine binding site and to suggest how binding of the tetramethylammonium headgroup of ACh may trigger the receptor activation process. The majority of experimental procedures were as described previously (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, residues 142–164 and 402–421 of the rat M1 mAChR were individually mutated to Ala (Ala itself was changed to Gly), using a polymerase chain reaction method. Mutant receptors, cloned into the pCD expression vector, and validated by di-deoxy sequencing, were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation. Membrane preparations were made after 72 h as described previously (18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Binding of (−)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) and (−)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) to membrane preparations was measured at 30 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Na-Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, using an incubation time of 1–3 h, as described previously (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was defined with 1 μm atropine. The binding of ACh was measured by inhibition of the binding of the 0.3 nm [3H]NMS. ACh-stimulated phosphoinositide (PhI) turnover was assayed in Krebs-bicarbonate solution following prelabeling of the transfected COS-7 cells with [3H]inositol for 48 h (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ligand saturation binding curves were fitted to a one-site model to yield a total concentration of binding sites and an affinity constant, KNMS. Inhibition curves for ACh were fitted to the Hill equation, and the binding constants,KACh, were corrected for the Cheng-Prusoff shift, as necessary (19Jones P.G. Curtis C.A.M. Hulme E.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). PhI dose-response curves were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function, yielding an EC50 value and a maximum response (Emax). Values of signaling efficacy, adjusted for variations in receptor expression, were calculated as described previously (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Ward S.D.C. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol.

A computer model of the M1 mAChR, incorporating a 129-amino acid deletion from the third intracellular loop, was built on the solved structure of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1F88 (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar)). The construct that was modeled retains unchanged ligand binding properties and good signaling ability (18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The model omits 20 amino acids at the N terminus. The crystal structure coordinates of rhodopsin were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (21Sussman J.L. Lin D. Jiang J. Manning N.O. Prilusky J. Ritter O. Aboral E.E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The modeling software used was QUANTA (release 4.0, MSI) running on a Silicon Graphics INDIGO2 workstation under the UNIX operating system. The “Modeler” option (22Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) within QUANTA was used to build 20 models of the M1 mAChR, including the conserved disulfide bridge. The different models were calculated by varying the initial model and optimizing the objective function using conjugate gradients and molecular dynamics with simulated annealing employing the CHARMM force field (23Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14019) Google Scholar). The model with the lowest objective function was used for manual docking of NMS and ACh. The phenyl ring of the tropic acid moiety of NMS was positioned to be equivalent to the β-ionone ring of retinal, causing the backbone of NMS to follow a path equivalent to that taken by the retinal chromophore in rhodopsin. TM helices 6 and 7 were moved as rigid bodies to relieve close contacts from residues in these helices. (−)-N-[3H]methylscopolamine (85 Ci/mmol), (−)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (50 Ci/mmol) and myo-d-[3H]inositol (80 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Several Ala substitution mutations in the exofacial parts of TM 4 and 7 strongly reduced the affinity of the quaternary antagonist [3H]NMS (Fig.1). W157A and P159A in TM 4 gave 123- and 63-fold reductions in NMS binding. A 13-fold reduction followed S153A. Three mutants in TM 7, Y404A, C407A, and Y408A, reduced NMS affinities by 25-, 19- and 48-fold, whereas, in contrast, N410A caused a 4-fold increase in affinity. However, only 6- to 9-fold reductions of NMS affinity were observed on the mutation of Tyr404 and Tyr408 to Phe. When examined with a second antagonist, [3H]QNB, we unexpectedly found that mutations of Y404A, C407A, and Y408A had little effect on the binding of QNB (Fig. 1, legend). One mutation, Y408A, in the exofacial part of TM 7 and three mutations, W150A, N414A, and P415A, in the endofacial region of TM 4 and 7, decreased expression levels of [3H]NMS binding sites to less than 6% of the wild-type level (Fig.2). Expression of these mutants was rescued to 46–117% of wild-type level by 48-h preincubation of the transfected cells with 10−6m atropine as described previously (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr404 and Tyr408 to Phe gave expression equivalent to 64 and 48% of the wild-type level, respectively. To examine the location of these receptors, we measured cell surface binding sites using the hydrophilic antagonist [3H]NMS, on intact cells transfected with selected mutants. This gave results that were consistent with those obtained using membrane preparations (Fig. 2, legend). Interestingly, the mutations T412A (TM 7) and M145A, L148A, L151A, A160G, and F163A (TM 4) showed slightly enhanced receptor expression. The binding of ACh to the wild-type M1 mAChR, expressed in COS-7 cells, was characterized by a slightly flattened binding isotherm (nH = 0.88) with an apparent affinity constant,KACh of 1.26 ± 105m−1. The ACh binding showed little GTP shift in these experiments (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The effects of Ala mutations in TM 4 and 7 are summarized in Fig. 3. Mutations that diminished NMS affinity also decreased ACh affinity. Mutation of Ile161, which gave only a 3-fold decrease of NMS affinity, caused a 10-fold reduction in the affinity of ACh. Mutation of Tyr404 and Tyr408 to Phe also caused 20-fold reductions in the ACh affinity. Among these mutants, only those of Tyr408 to Ala or Phe significantly affected the affinity of receptor for the onium headgroup of ACh, tetramethylammonium, giving a 3-fold lower affinity than the wild-type receptor. 2Z.-L. Lu, unpublished observations. As in the case of the His substitution mutations (13Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5682-5686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), Ala mutations of Asn414, Pro415, and Tyr418 at the intracellular end of TM 7 strongly increased the affinity of ACh by between 15- to 22- fold (Fig. 3 b). The mutations A160G in TM4 and W405A, N410A, V413A, M416A, C417A, and C421A in TM 7 also caused 2- to 4-fold increases in the ACh affinity. The Hill coefficients were unaltered for most mutations except for W157A, Y404A, and N410A, whose mutation led to a steep ACh binding curve (nH = 1). ACh elicits a robust PhI response from COS-7 cells transfected with the wild-type M1 mAChR, with an EC50 value of 0.1 μm, and an Emax value equivalent to three times the basal activity. The effects of the Ala substitution mutations on the PhI response are summarized in Fig.4. In TM 4, mutations that reduced ACh affinity also reduced ACh potency in eliciting the PhI response. The maximum responses given by W157A and P159A, which showed the largest reductions in potency, were also diminished. In TM 7, parallel effects on ACh binding and the functional response were seen in the exofacial region of the TM helix, although, interestingly, the maximum response given by the L402A mutation was reduced to 52% of wild-type without an effect on the ACh potency. The maximum PhI responses following Ala, but not the Phe substitutions of Tyr404 and Tyr408 were reduced. The mutations A160G and W405A caused constitutive activation, giving a basal activity equivalent to 12–20% of the Emax of wild-type (Fig. 5). In contrast to the increases seen in ACh affinity, Ala substitutions of the highly conserved amino acids in the motif Asn410-Ser411-X-X-Tyr414-Pro415-X-X-Tyr418, located between the center and the C terminus of TM 7, generally reduced ACh potency. The maximum responses were also reduced to less than 75% of wild-type response. In particular, the N414A mutant completely failed to elicit a PhI response to ACh stimulation, even after atropine preincubation, which increased the expression of [3H]NMS binding sites to 117% of the wild-type level. The exception was Pro415, where the Ala mutant retained the same ACh potency as the wild-type, measured after atropine preincubation and washout. Calculations of the ACh signaling efficacy were performed as described previously (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Ward S.D.C. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol.

These assessments distinguish the effects of mutations on the functional potency from the effects on the agonist affinity, taking into account changes in receptor expression levels. The results are summarized in Fig. 6. In the exofacial regions of TM 4 and 7, there was a 160-fold reduction for W157A, and 7- to 23-fold reductions for P159A, L402A, Y404A, and Y408A. The Y404F and Y408F mutations did not affect ACh signaling efficacy, whereas A160G and W405A caused 2-fold increases. In the endofacial region of TM 7, the mutation Y418A decreased ACh efficacy by 160-fold, whereas N414A gave essentially zero efficacy. Mutations of N410A, S411A, P415A, and A419G also gave a 4- to 12-fold reduction, whereas V413A and M416A caused 2-fold increases. With the exception of L402A, reductions in the Emax values were seen when large reductions in the signaling efficacy of the mutants were calculated from the potency of ACh relative to its binding affinity. Measurements of changes in binding and signaling, resulting from Ala substitution mutagenesis, help to elucidate the functions of the amino acid side chains studied, by distinguishing the null residues from those making contacts that contribute primarily to the ground state, the activated state(s), or both the ground and activated states of the receptor and its ligand complexes (24Hulme E.C. Lu Z.L. Ward S.D.C. Allman K. Curtis C.A.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we report all of the residues in TM 4 and 7 of the M1 mAChR that have a role in ligand anchoring and signal transduction, as well as a set of residues that are critical for receptor stabilization and the on-off switch. Several of these residues have been targeted previously (8Heitz F. Holzwarth J.A. Gies J.-P. Pruss R.M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hibert M.F. Guenet C. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), but this is the first comprehensive study that allows their relative importance to be ranked and their role in receptor function to be analyzed. The exofacial sequences of TM 4 and 7 are critical for binding both the agonist ACh, and the antagonist NMS. In TM 4, Ala substitution of Trp157 (4.57), and Pro159 (4.59) caused 100-fold decreases in ACh and NMS affinity, in agreement with observations on the M2 and M3 mAChRs (8Heitz F. Holzwarth J.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mutation of Trp157 also reduced QNB affinity by 300-fold. As in the M2 mAChR (8Heitz F. Holzwarth J.A. Gies J.-P. Pruss R.M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hibert M.F. Guenet C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), this residue seems very important for the binding of classical muscarinic antagonists. Ser153 (4.53) is also influential in NMS and ACh binding. In contrast, mutation of Ile161 (4.61) reduced ACh affinity by 10-fold but had less effect on NMS binding. Similar phenotypes have been observed in TM 3 (Ser109) (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and TM 5 (Thr189, Thr192, and Ala196) (2Allman K. Page K.M. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of signaling efficacy suggested that Trp157 also has a very important role in transduction of ACh binding into receptor activation, whereas mutation of Pro159 had a smaller effect. These were the only residues in TM 4 whose mutation strongly decreased signaling efficacy. Trp150 (4.50) probably makes important intramolecular contacts, because its mutation strongly reduced receptor expression, but these do not seem to be differentially involved in formation of the activated state of the receptor, because signaling efficacy was unaffected. A precedent is set by Asp122 and Tyr124 in TM 3 (18Lu Z.L. Curtis C.A. Jones P.G. Pavia J. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, the homologous tryptophan makes a hydrogen bond with TM 2 (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Trp 4.50 is highly conserved, reflecting its structural importance in other members of the superfamily. In TM 7, mutation of Tyr404 (7.39) and Tyr408(7.43) to Phe reduced ACh affinity, but had smaller effects on NMS affinity, in agreement with studies on the M3 mAChR (11Wess J. Maggio R. Palmer J.R. Vogel Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19313-19319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the aromatic ring, by mutation to Ala, gave a further reduction in NMS, but not ACh affinity. Interestingly, the affinity of the receptor for QNB was not affected by the mutation of Tyr404, Cys407 and Tyr408, suggesting that QNB, unlike NMS, does not interact strongly with these residues. We have reported similar behavior for Tyr381(6.51) in TM 6 (3Ward S.D.C. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results clearly indicate that NMS and QNB have different binding modes, and contact different residues. Ala, but not Phe mutations of Tyr404 and Tyr408decreased ACh signaling efficacy. Again this behavior follows the model established by Tyr381. As we have proposed for the latter residue, the Tyr hydroxyl groups may participate in anchoring the agonist in the binding site, while the aromatic rings form part of an aromatic cage that closes around the tetramethylammonium headgroup of ACh to trigger receptor activation. It is likely that the two Tyr residues work in tandem, and it would be interesting to examine the properties of double mutant. To aid interpretation of the mutagenesis results, a molecular model of the M1 mAChR was built, based on the coordinates of the ground state structure of rhodopsin (4; see “Experimental Procedures”). A superposition of the results of the mutagenesis studies described in this and previous (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) studies is shown in Fig. 7. Residues whose Ala substitution reduced ACh affinity by at least 5-fold (Trp101, Leu102, Asp105, Tyr106, Ser109, Asn110, Thr189, Thr192, Ala196, Tyr381, Asn382, Leu386, Tyr404, Cys407, and Tyr408) form a continuous lining to a cavity between TM 3, 5, 6, and 7. This generates a binding cleft with Asp105 at one end. There is an outcropping of residues (Ser153, Trp157, and Ile161) on TM 4 facing toward Asp99 (TM 3), defining a subsidiary cleft. The conserved disulfide bond (Cys98-Cys178) helps to define both of these structures. There is much overlap between NMS and ACh binding residues (Fig. 7, shown in yellow). Several residues whose mutation reduced ACh but not NMS affinity (orange) occur near the top of TM 5 (Thr189, Thr192, Ala196) and TM 6 (Leu386), delimiting the furthest extent of the central binding cavity. Two residues (Val113, Phe374) whose mutation reduced NMS but not ACh affinity (olive) are more deeply buried within the transmembrane regions, and along with Ser109 and Trp378 (8Heitz F. Holzwarth J.A. Gies J.-P. Pruss R.M. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hibert M.F. Guenet C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 380: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) contribute to the floor of the cavity. The active S-(−)-enantiomer of NMS could be docked into this model along a vector equivalent to that defined by the retinal chromophore, after allowing small, outward rigid-body movements of TM 6 and 7, to relieve unfavorable contacts. NMS snugly fills the cavity between Asp105, Tyr106, Tyr381, Asn 382, Tyr404, Cys407, and Tyr408 (Fig.8 a). This group includes seven of the nine residues whose Ala substitution mutation caused greater than 30-fold reductions in NMS affinity, the others being Trp157 and Pro159 in TM 4. Interestingly, the phenyl ring of NMS is modeled to be close to Asn110 and Val113 (TM 3) and Phe374 (TM 6),2whose mutation caused ∼10-fold reductions in NMS affinity (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A recent transferred nuclear Overhauser effect NMR study ofS-(+)-acetyl-β-methyl choline bound to the M2mAChR (27Furukawa H. Haga T. Muto Y. Yokoyama T. Hamada T. Hirota H. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2621Google Scholar) has suggested that the conformer, which is bound in the ground state of the muscarinic binding site, is gauche, with an NCCO torsion angle of 60°. Assuming this to be true for the M1 mAChR also, we have manually docked the gauche conformer of ACh into the model of the M1 mAChR, placing the ester function of ACh in such a position that the carbonyl oxygen can hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of Tyr381, and the ester oxygen to the hydroxyl group of Tyr106, in agreement with a previous suggestion (3Ward S.D.C. Curtis C.A. Hulme E.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compared with the scopine headgroup of NMS, the tetramethylammonium headgroup of ACh occupies less volume within the binding cleft (Fig.8 b). During activation, the charge-stabilized hydrophobic cage may close about the ACh headgroup, eliminating this cavity. This would explain why tetramethylammonium can activate mAChRs, whereas ethyl substitutions on the quaternary nitrogen of ACh strongly and progressively reduce efficacy, and, more generally, why muscarinic agonists of high efficacy have compact, positively charged headgroups (28Barlow R.B. Introduction to Chemical Pharmacology. 2nd Ed. Methuen & Co Ltd., London1964: 185-240Google Scholar). Closure of the cage would necessitate movements of TM 6 and 7, relative to TM 3. In the β2, NK1, and C5a receptors, and rhodopsin (30Elling C.E. Thirstrup K. Holst B. Schwartz T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12322-12327Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Holst B. Elling C.E. Schwartz T.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Gerber B.O.

Oprian D.D. Neuron. 1992; 9: 719-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), a movement of the outer segment of TM 7 relative to TM 3 may also be important in activation. Analysis of structure-activity data (29Schulman J.R. Sabio M.L. Disch R.L. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) shows the conformation of bound ACh to be trans (anticlinal) in the activated state of the receptor, with an NCCO angle of about 132°. This suggests that the transition of ACh from a gauche to an extended conformer may be part of the activation process. This could lead to a change in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the agonist. It has not proved possible to fit the trans conformer of ACh into the ground state model of the ACh binding site. The pre-eminent role of Trp157 in muscarinic ligand binding, and receptor activation, is harder to understand. In our model, the aromatic ring of Trp157 is too far from the aromatic cage to act as a primary contact. There are several possibilities. One is that the effect of Trp157 is indirect, stabilizing the primary aromatic cage by packing against it. The large effect of mutating Pro159 is probably indirect, because its side chain faces the lipid bilayer (26Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A second is that a major conformational change occurs after ligand binding. In rhodopsin, a photoreactive retinal analogue, which labels TM 6 in the ground state, reacts with a position equivalent to Ala158 (4.58) after activation (6Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A third possibility is that the position of TM 4 in the ground state of the M1 mAChR is significantly different from its position in the ground state of rhodopsin. Notably, the position of the only residue in TM 4 of rhodopsin which contributes to the ground state retinal binding pocket is equivalent to Leu156 (4.56) (4Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar) not Trp157 (4.57). In contrast, all of the key contact residues in other parts of the structure are in precise register with one another. In our molecular model of the M1 mAChR, TM 4 is kinked near the conserved Pro159. The residues Ser153, Trp157, and Ile161 are modeled to be located at the boundary between TM 3 and 4, facing the central cavity, whereas Pro159 is modeled to face away, toward the phospholipid bilayer. Interestingly, Trp157 and Ile161 are close to Asp99, located at the N terminus of TM 3. Asp99 has been proposed to act as a primary contact residue before ligands enter the central binding site (34Jakubik J. El-Fakahany E.E. Tucek S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18836-18844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This cluster of amino acids may form a peripheral ligand contact site (Fig. 9), whereas Pro159provides an indirect conformational switch to produce a high affinity ligand binding pocket and reposition Trp157, which then contributes to the subsequent high affinity binding and receptor activation. Thus, Trp157 may participate in an obligatory ligand docking step. Mobilization of TM 7 and TM 4 in the region of the binding site would be consistent with the constitutive activation resulting from the Ala substitution of Trp405 (7.40) and the mutation of Ala160 (4.60) to Gly. A conformational change in the exofacial segment of TM 7 may explain the anomalous behavior of L402A, where, as in the case of the N115A mutant in TM 3 (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), reduction of the maximum PhI response was dissociated from a reduction in ACh potency. These mutants require further investigation. In contrast to Trp150 (4.50), Ala substitution of Asn414 (7.49) and Pro415 (7.50), in the endofacial domain of TM 7, strongly increased ACh affinity, despite reducing receptor expression. In a previous study, we showed that multiple His substitution mutations of Leu116, Phe374, and Asn414 created a high affinity Zn2+ binding site, consistent with the possibility of direct Van der Waals contacts between their side chains (13Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5682-5686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The finding that the corresponding Ala substitutions increase ACh affinity, or cause constitutive activation (1Lu Z.L. Hulme E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7309-7315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 35Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Henderson S.C. Ducote K.R. Brann M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21563-21568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), suggests that such contacts may help to selectively stabilize the ground state of the receptor and may be disrupted during receptor activation. In addition to these potential Van der Waals contacts, the rhodopsin structure and the model of the M1 mAChR suggest that the highly conserved residues in the Asn410-Ser411-X-X-Asn414-Pro415-X-X-Tyr418motif are probably integrated into a network of hydrogen bonds connecting TM 7 to TM 1, TM 2, and TM 3 in the ground state of the receptor. The finding that mutations of these residues strongly reduced signaling efficacy, despite increased or unchanged (Ser411) ACh affinity, implies that they have an additional role in stabilizing the active state of the agonist-receptor-G protein complex. It is likely that a new set of inter-helical hydrogen bonds forms in the activated state, possibly similar to that proposed by Weinstein and colleagues (36Konvicka K. Guarnieri F. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The conserved Asn-Pro motif is likely to mediate this conformational change through the kink and mobility which it introduces into this segment of TM 7. In rhodopsin (37Abdulaev N.G. Ridge K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12854-12859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), this results in exposure of a buried epitope containing part of the highly conserved NPXXY motif, and a substantial increase in conformational mobility in the region of the H8 helix, as well as a rotation and outward movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM 6 (38Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). In summary, the inward-facing surfaces of the exofacial domains of TM 4 and 7 participate in ACh binding. Their aromatic residues may, together with those of TM 3 and 6, form a charge-stabilized aromatic cage that closes around the positively charged headgroup of ACh. In agreement with the hypothesis of Hibert et al. (39Hibert M.F. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Hoflack J. Bruinvels A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 7-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this would trigger relative rotations and translations of TM 3, 6, and 7, breaking the intramolecular constraints that stabilize the ground state and leading to receptor activation. The strongly conserved amino acids making up the NSXXNPXXY motif in the buried endofacial domain of TM 7 may have dual functions in the on-off interconversion. They may form intramolecular contacts that stabilize the receptor in the inactive ground state but are broken by agonist binding to the extracellular side, allowing them to build a new set of intramolecular contacts. The latter are crucial to maintain the receptor in the activated state and create an appropriate binding pocket for the G protein."

Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 was shown to be mediated by RSK2, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1), and mitogen-activated protein kinases depending on the specific stimulation or stress. Our previous study showed that mitogen-activated protein kinases MAP kinases are involved in ultraviolet B-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (Zhong, S., Zhong, Z., Jansen, J., Goto, H., Inagaki, M., and Dong, Z.,J. Biol. Chem.276, 12932–12937). However, downstream effectors of MAP kinases remain to be identified. Here, we report that H89, a selective inhibitor of the nucleosomal response, totally inhibits ultraviolet B-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. H89 blocks MSK1 activity but does not inhibit ultraviolet B-induced activation of MAP kinases p70/85S6K, p90RSK, Akt, and protein kinase A. Furthermore, MSK1 markedly phosphorylated serine 28 of histone H3 and chromatin in vitro.

Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is involved in different signal transduction pathways and is dependent on the specific stimulation or stress. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 induces phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10, which is mediated by RSK-2 (2Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). RSK-2 mutation in humans is linked to Coffin-Lowery syndrome and fibroblasts derived from a Coffin-Lowery syndrome patient fail to exhibit EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 (2). This implies that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 may be significant in this disease. In addition, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (MSK1) has been shown to mediate EGF or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (1). Phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is consistent with phosphorylation of high mobility group protein-14, which forms the nucleosomal response. The nucleosomal response is closely related to induction of immediate early response genes (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation markedly induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and the phosphorylation was inhibited by PD 98509, a MEK1 inhibitor, SB 202190, a p38 kinase inhibitor, and is blocked in dominant negative mutant-ERK and dominant negative mutant-p38 kinase cells (9Zhong S.P. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results showed that MAP kinases mediate UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. Although the understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 has increased in recent years, the details of the relationship between phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10, gene expression, and chromatin remodeling are still unclear and need further study. Although phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 is related to chromosome condensation, phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 also occurs in chromosomes predominantly during early mitosis and coincides with the initiation of mitotic chromosome condensation in various mammalian cell lines (10Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, the signal transduction pathway mediating histone H3 at serine 28 is unknown. Very recently, we reported that UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 was mediated by ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNK1 (11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar), but the downstream effectors of these MAP kinases involved in phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 are still unknown. However, the difference in timing between activation of MAP kinases and phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 implies that downstream effectors may mediate UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. In this article, we used H89, which is a selective inhibitor of the nucleosomal response, to identify the downstream effectors of MAP kinases. H89 totally inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, but enhanced UVB-induced activation of MAP kinases, p70/85S6k, p90RSK, and Akt in JB6 cells after UVB irradiation. On the other hand, UVB irradiation had no effect on protein kinase A (PKA). Active MSK1 strongly phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 28 in vitro. H89 markedly inhibited MSK1 activity and MSK1 mediated-phosphorylation of histone H3 in vitro. In addition, N-terminal and C-terminal mutants of MSK1 blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 in JB6 cells. Together, these data indicate that MSK1 mediates UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. H89 was from Alexis Corp.

Alessi (MRC Oritein Phosphorylation Unit, Dundee, United Kingdom); and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Millipore Corp. (Chicago, IL). Equivalent numbers of JB6 cells or JB6 cells transfected with N-terminal mutant MSK1, C-terminal mutant MSK1, or wild-type MSK1 were seeded in 10-cm dishes and cultured in 5% FBS/MEM until they reached 85% confluence. They were then starved in 0.1% FBS/MEM for 48 h with one change of medium after 24 h. Cells were then incubated for 2 h in fresh 0.1% FBS/MEM, after which time they were exposed to UVB (4 kJ/m2) and then cultured for additional time periods. Because the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber filtered with a Kodak Kodacel K6808TM filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. After UVB irradiation, cultured cells were harvested and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Acid-solution protein extraction was carried out as described by the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology (www.upstatebiotech.com). In brief, acid-soluble proteins were extracted with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and then H2SO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m (0.4 N) and extractions were left for 60 min on ice. Supernatant fractions were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes after centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and precipitated on ice for 45 min with a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid. These tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and the pellets were then washed once with acidic acetone and once with acetone. The acid-soluble proteins were stored at −20 °C. Acid-soluble proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE after boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. Resolved acid-soluble proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the first antibody against either phosphorylated H3 (at serine 28) (10Goto H.

These membranes were then incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with secondary antibodies against rat IgG conjugated-AP or rabbit IgG-conjugated AP, respectively. Membrane bound proteins were detected with enzyme-catalyzed fluorescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and analyzed using the Storm 840 Scanner (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Stable transfections were conducted using the LF2000 reagent (from Life Technologies, Inc.) and pCMV5-FLAG vector, pCMV5-FLAG-wild-type MSK1, pCMV-FLAG-MSK1 A195-N-terminal kinase-dead, or pCMV5-FLAG-MSK1-A565/C-terminal kinase-dead (Dr. D. Alessi, MRC Oritein Phosphorylation Unit). The stable transfection was carried out as described in the protocol from Life Technologies, Inc. (www.lifetech.com/transfection/celltypes/). In brief, 1–3 × 106 JB6 cells were seeded in 6-well plates in 5% FBS/MEM until they reached 90–95% confluence. For each well of cells to be transfected, 10 µg of DNA pCMV5-FLAG vector, pCMV5-FLAG-wild-type MSK1, pCMV-FLAG-MSK1 A195-N-terminal kinase-dead, or pCMV5-FLAG-MSK1-A565/C-terminal kinase-dead were diluted into 500 µl of serum-free media. LF2000 reagent (20 µl) was diluted into 500 µl of serum-free media and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Diluted DNA and LF2000 reagent were mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature to allow the DNA-LF2000 reagent complexes to form. DNA-LF2000 reagent was added into each well and mixed gently by rocking the plates back and forth for 2 min. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h and then media were changed to fresh growth media. The next day, selective media containing 400 µg/ml G-418 were added until all nontransfected cells were dead resulting in selection of single clone cells. Individual G418-resistant colonies were picked, expanded, and maintained in the presence of G-418 (200 µg/ml). Control cells were transfected with pCMV5-FLAG neo only (“mock”). Individual colonies as well as bulk cultures of G418 selected cells were tested for FLAG-epitope-tagged MSK1 by indirect immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal FLAG antibody. Phosphorylation of the Akt/SGK substrate peptide or pure histone H3 by MSK1 was carried out as described by the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology (www.upstatebiotech.com). In brief, the following components were added to a series of tubes: 10 µl of assay dilution buffer (ADB: 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol); 10 µl of Akt/SGK substrate peptide or pure histone H3; 10 µl of MSK1 in ADB; and 10 µl of [γ-32P]ATP mixture (1 µCi/µl). Tubes were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and then 30 µl of the mixture was spotted to individual pieces of p81 paper (2 cm2). The assay squares were washed with 0.75% phosphoric acid and acetone and then transferred to scintillation vials with 5-ml scintillation mixture and counted in a scintillation counter. Phosphorylation of pure histone H3 and chromatin by active MSK1 was carried out as described previously (9Zhong S.P. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In brief, pure histone H3 or chromatin from JB6 cells was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C with active MSK1 and 200 µm ATP in 50 µl of kinase buffer (25 mmTris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and phosphorylated H3 was detected by Western blotting with H3-phospho-specific antibodies (10Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M.

Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar). Non-phosphorylated histone H3 was detected with an antibody against total H3. To study whether MSK1 mediates UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28, we first exposed mouse epidermal JB6 cells to UVB irradiation and analyzed the phosphorylation of H3 by Western blot using a specific antibody against phosphorylated H3 at serine 28 (10, 11). Acetylation of histone H3 was also detected in the same samples with a specific antibody against acetylation of H3 at lysine 9. A dose-response study showed that phosphorylation of H3 gradually increased with UVB exposures from 1 to 6 kJ/m2 (Fig.1A). The time course study showed that UVB (4 kJ/m2) induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in JB6 C1 41 mouse epidermal cells (Fig. 1 B). Phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 was greater at 30 or 60 min than at 15 or 120 min following UVB irradiation (Fig.1 B) (11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar). These results indicate that UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 is dose- and time-dependent. However, acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 was unaffected by UVB irradiation (Fig. 1, A3 andB3). H89 (N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)- ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide), has an inhibitory action against cyclic AMP-dependent PKA (12Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study showed that H89 was a selective inhibitor of the nucleosomal response and inhibited the TPA- or anisomycin-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 mediated by MSK1 (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, H89 provides a useful tool to investigate changes in the nucleosomal protein, histone H3, following an extracellular stimulation such as UVB irradiation. Our recent study showed that MAP kinases mediated UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (11). To determine whether H89 affects UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, we pretreated JB6 cells with different concentrations of H89 for 1 h and then exposed the cells to UVB irradiation (4 kJ/m2). The results showed that H89 markedly inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2A). In addition, H89 (20 µm) totally inhibited UVB-induced histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 28 in JB6 cells at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min following UVB irradiation (Fig. 2 B). JB6 cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes in 5% FBS/MEM until they reached 85–90% confluence. Cells were then exposed to UVB (4 kJ/m2) and cultured for additional time periods as indicated. Phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, or JNKs was analyzed by Western blot with specific antibodies. The results showed that UVB strongly induced phosphorylation of ERKs and JNKs in JB6 cells (Fig.3, A and C). Phosphorylation of p38 kinase was also induced after UVB irradiation, but to a lesser degree (Fig. 3 B). The level of phosphorylation of ERKs was higher at 15 than at 30 min after UVB irradiation and was not detected at 60 min. However, phosphorylation of JNKs and p38 kinase was also detected at 30 and 60 min. These results indicate that the time course of activation of MAP kinases (Fig. 3) and phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 induced by UVB irradiation (Fig. 1 B) (11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar) is different. The above experiments indicated that UVB strongly induced phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs. Our recent study indicated that ERK1, ERK2, p38 kinase, and JNK1 are involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (11). To further determine the role of MAP kinase activation in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, we used H89 to treat JB6 cells before UVB irradiation and then detected phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs. Our results showed that rather than inhibiting phosphorylation of MAP kinases, 20 µm H89 actually increased UVB-induced phosphorylation of ERKs (Fig.4A), and to a lesser degree, p38 kinase (Fig. 4 B) and JNKs (Fig. 4 C). This suggests that H89 may inhibit other protein kinases, which results in the observed repression of UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (Fig. 2 B). Downstream kinases of ERKs include p70/85S6K and p90RSK. Akt is an upstream kinase of p70/85S6K, but H89 also enhanced UVB-induced phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 4 D), p70/85S6K(Fig. 4 E), and p90RSK (Fig. 4 F) in JB6 cells. These results suggest that UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 does not occur through activation of ERKs, p38 kinase, JNKs, p70/85S6K, p90RSK, or Akt and thus implies that other protein kinases are involved. H89 has been shown to have a potent and selective inhibitory action against PKA and also to significantly inhibit cAMP-dependent histone IIb phosphorylation activity (12Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKA is involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, we studied the change in phosphorylation of PKA after UVB irradiation. The results showed that in JB6 cells, UVB had no effect on phosphorylation of PKA at any of the time points studied (data not shown). H89, PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK1 (1Thomson S.

On the other hand, both SB 202190 and PD 98059 strongly inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of p38 kinase and ERKs (Fig. 5, B andC) (11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar). Moreover, H89, SB 202190, and PD 98059 markedly inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 in JB6 cells (Fig. 5 F). Therefore, H89 targeted kinases still need to be identified. The covalent modification of the N-terminal tail of histone H3 by acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation regulates transcriptional “on or off” activity (15Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and influences chromatin remodeling, chromosome condensation, and segregation (18Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D.

Cell. 1999; 97: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). However, these different types of covalent modifications of histone H3 at different sites of the N-terminal tail appear to have various effects in cells. Recently, Rea et al. (18Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar) reported that methylation of lysine 9 interfered with phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3, but was also influenced by pre-existing modification in the N terminus of H3. At least one study has shown that MSK1 mediates phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 stimulated by EGF, TPA, or anisomycin (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Whether MSK1 is involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 is unknown. To investigate the role of MSK1 in phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, we first used Akt/SGK substrate peptide or a pure histone H3 peptide as MSK1 substrates to determine whether H89, PD 98059, or SB 202190 inhibits MSK1 activity. The results showed that 20 µm H89 totally inhibited MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of the Akt/SGK substrate peptide, whereas 50 µm PD 98059 and 2 µm SB 202190 did not affect MSK1 activity (data not shown) in vitro. In addition, using a pure histone H3 peptide as substrate, we further determined whether H89, PD 98059, or SB 202190 inhibits MSK1 activity. Results revealed that 20 µm H89, 50 µm PD 98059, or 2 µm SB 202190 all inhibited MSK1 phosphorylation of histone H3 (data not shown) in vitro. These results indicated that H89 inhibited UVB-induced MSK1 activity. The inhibitory effect of H89 on EGF-induced MSK1 activity has been reported by Thomsonet al. (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To confirm that MSK1 specifically phosphorylates histone H3 at serine 28, we incubated pure H3 protein with MSK1 in the presence of 200 µm ATP. The phosphorylation level of H3 at serine 28 was detected with specific antibodies by Western blot analysis (10Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar). Results showed that active MSK1 strongly phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 28 in vitro in an apparent dose-dependent manner (Fig.6A). Using chromatin isolated from JB6 cells as a substrate for MSK1, we obtained similar results (Fig. 6 B), indicating that MSK1 could cause H3 protein phosphorylation at serine 28 of chromatin in vitro. The above results indicate that MSK1 may be a mediator of H3 phosphorylation at serine 28. To further confirm that MSK1 has a specific role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, we transfected JB6 cells with plasmids containing a pCMV5-FLAG vector, pCMV5-FLAG-wild-type MSK1, pCMV-FLAG-MSK1 A195-N-terminal kinase-dead, or pCMV5-FLAG-MSK1-A565/C-terminal kinase-dead. MSK1 proteins from these UVB-treated transfected cells were immunoprecipitated using sheep IgG against MSK1 and then the MSK1 kinase assay was performed using [γ-32P]ATP. The results showed that N-terminal and C-terminal mutant MSK1 markedly blocked MSK1 activity compared with wild-type MSK1 (Fig. 7A). In addition, we also determined whether mutant MSK1 specifically blocked the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 in JB6 cells. JB6 cells transfected with the N-terminal mutant MSK1, C-terminal mutant MSK1, or wild-type MSK1 were exposed to UVB and then phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 was analyzed by Western blotting. The results revealed that both N-terminal mutant MSK1 and C-terminal mutant MSK1 (Fig. 7, B1 and B2) blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28, compared with wild-type MSK1 in vivo. Together, these results indicate that MSK1 indeed mediates phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. This study further elucidates the signal transduction pathways involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 by focusing particularly on routes by which the phosphorylation of this protein is mediated downstream of MAP kinases. Using H89, a selective inhibitor of the nucleosomal response (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), we found that 20 µm H89 totally inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. However, H89 actually appeared to enhance UVB-induced activation of ERKs, p38 kinase, JNKs, p70/85S6K, p90RSK, and Akt. In contrast, MSK1 activity was markedly inhibited by 20 µm H89 in vitro. Active MSK1 strongly phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 28 and mutant forms of MSK1 blocked UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. These results clearly suggest that MSK1 is a mediator of UVB-induced phosphorylation of H3 at serine 28 in JB6 cells. N-terminal phosphorylation of histone H3 is highly associated with cell cycle regulation (21Ajiro K. Nishimoto T. J. Biol.

Yasuda H. Tsuji H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Histone H3 at serine 10 is specifically phosphorylated in mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation (5Wei Y. Mizzen C.A. Cook R.G. Gorovsky M.A. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chromosoma. 1997; 106: 348-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1521) Google Scholar). In contrast, the N-terminal tail of histone H3 is not phosphorylated during interphase but becomes phosphorylated at serine 10 just prior to metaphase (25Guo X.W. Th'ng J.P. Swank R.A. Anderson H.J. Tudan C. Bradbury E.M. Roberge M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 976-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, site-specific phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 occurs during mitosis (6Gurley L.R. D'Anna J.A. Barham S.S. Deaven L.L. Tobey R.A. Eur. J.

These phosphorylations were shown to be mediated by RSK2 (2Sassone-Corsi P. Mizzen C.A. Cheung P. Crosio C. Monaco L. Jacquot S. Hanauer A. Allis C.D. Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), MSK1 (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 occurred specifically during early mitosis, at least in mammalian cells and correlated closely with mitotic chromosome condensation (10Goto H. Tomono Y. Ajiro K. Kosako H. Fujita M. Sakurai M. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Okigaki T. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25543-25549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance and signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 remain unknown. Our recent study showed that MAP kinases are involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (11). However, UVB-induced H3 serine 28 phosphorylation is time delayed compared with UVB-induced activation of MAP kinases (11Zhong S.P. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12982-12987Google Scholar), which suggests that downstream effectors of MAP kinases may play an important role in mediating UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. In this study, we used the nucleosome response inhibitor, H89, to explore downstream effectors of MAP kinases after UVB irradiation. H89 could be a very useful probe for investigating the identity of kinases leading to phosphorylation of histone H3 because a 20 µmconcentration of H89 totally inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of this protein. UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 was shown to be markedly inhibited by PD 98059 and SB 202190 and dominant negative mutants of ERK2, p38 kinases, and JNK1, indicating that MAP kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (11). Therefore, we determined whether H89 inhibits MAP kinase activation after UVB irradiation. Surprisingly, H89 appeared to enhance UVB-induced activation or phosphorylation of ERKs, p38 kinase, and JNKs (Fig. 4, A-C). These results suggest that H89 may inhibit downstream effectors of MAP kinases. For example, p90RSK is a downstream kinase of ERK1/2 (31Pierrat B. da Silva Correia J. Mary J.-L. Tomás-Zuber M.

However, our results indicated that H89 also enhanced p90RSK activation after UVB irradiation in JB6 cells. Other potential candidates for mediating phosphorylation of H3 include the p70 and p85 S6 kinases, which are homologues with a difference of 23 amino acids (34Polakiewicz R.D. Schieferl S.M.

They contain a bifurcation that produces histone H3-high mobility group-like protein phosphorylation and c-fos/c-jun induction in the nucleus (36Kardalinou E. Zhelev N. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1066-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results indicated that although UVB induced the activation of Akt and p70/85S6K, similar to the results seen with other kinases studied, H89 enhanced this activation (Fig. 4,E and F). These data further suggest that H89 may act on other pathways or downstream effectors of the MAP kinase pathway to repress the UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. PKA is a prototype serine/theronine kinase that is activated by cAMP (37Walsh D.A. Perkins J.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3763-3765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Greengard P. Science. 1978; 199: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). PKA phosphorylates an extremely broad range of substrates, including histone H2B and cAMP-response element-binding protein (12Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K.

Pfizenmaier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether H89 inhibits UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 through the PKA pathway is important. UVB, PD 98059, or SB 202190 had no effect on PKA (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, H89 did not affect PKA phosphorylation in JB6 cells suggesting that other downstream effectors are involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. In agreement with the report of Thomson et al. (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), our data indicated that H89 is a MSK1 inhibitor. The C-terminal kinase domain of MSK1 is essential for activation of the N-terminal domain and an inactivation mutation either in the N-terminal or C-terminal kinase domain completely abolishes MSK1 activation (30Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Endogenous MSK1 is activated by EGF, TPA, or UV irradiation (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 30Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). MSK1 is involved in the phosphorylation of several transcription factors (e.g. cAMP-response element-binding protein and ATF1) and nucleosomal components (e.g. histone H3 and high mobility group-14) (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 30Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that H89 inhibited EGF- or TPA-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 and high mobility group protein-14, which was mediated by MSK1 (1Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, this prompted us to explore whether MSK1 is involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. Using the Akt/SGK peptide as a substrate of MSK1, our results showed that H89 specifically inhibited MSK1 activity (Fig. 6 A), but PD 98059 or SB 202190 had no effect. On the other hand, all three compounds inhibited phosphorylation of histone H3 by MSK1 (Fig.6 B) in vitro. This indicates that PD 98059 not only inhibits ERKs activation, but also inhibits MSK1-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 (11). Transfection experiments comparing wild-type MSK1 to N-terminal or C-terminal kinase-dead mutants of MSK1, further confirm that MSK1 mediates UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. Because the efficiency level of H89 inhibition for UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 in JB6 cells (Fig. 2 B) is much higher than mutant inactivation of MSK1 in transfected JB6 cells (Fig.7 B), whether H89 may still influence other downstream effectors of MSK1 or other protein kinases besides MSK1 is unclear. In summary, our studies demonstrate that MSK1 mediates UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28. The time delay between phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 and activation of MAP kinases may indicate that UVB irradiation first induces activation of MAP kinases and then MAP kinases activate MSK1 to cause phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 forming a signal transduction pathway leading to phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 induced by UVB irradiation (1Thomson S.

However, the identity of upstream effectors of MAP kinases involved in UVB-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 28 still needs to be determined. We particularly thank Dr. D. R. Alessi for providing plasmids of pCMV5-FLAG vector, pCMV5-FLAG-wild-type MSK1, pCMV-FLAG-MSK1 A195-N-terminal kinase-dead, and pCMV5-FLAG-MSK1-A565/C-terminal kinase-dead."

Understanding this last step depends on the identification of molecules that act late in the fusion process. Here we demonstrate that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Vac8p, a myristoylated and palmitoylated armadillo repeat protein, is required for homotypic vacuole fusion. Vac8p is palmitoylated during the fusion reaction, and the ability of Vac8p to be palmitoylated appears to be necessary for its function in fusion. Both in vivo and in vitro analyses show that Vac8p functions after both Rab-dependent vacuole docking and the formation of trans-SNARE pairs. We propose that Vac8p may bind the fusion machinery through its armadillo repeats and that palmitoylation brings this machinery to a specialized lipid domain that facilitates bilayer mixing.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lysosome (vacuole) homotypic fusion is involved in three distinct aspects of vacuole biogenesis. First, during cell division the mother cell vacuoles form vesicular/tubular segregation structures that migrate into the daughter cells and fuse to establish a new vacuole (1Bachmair A. Finley D.

Second, during zygote formation the segregation structures from each mother cell fuse, generating the bud vacuole and exchanging vacuole material (2Weisman L.S. Wickner W. Science. 1988; 241: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Third, yeast vacuoles undergo regulated rapid fission and fusion events. This allows yeast cells to rapidly change the volume of the vacuole in response to changes in osmolarity of their environment.Development of an in vitro vacuole fusion assay (6Conradt B. Shaw J.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reveal three distinct events in the vacuole fusion pathway: priming, docking, and fusion. Several molecules required for priming and docking have been identified. However, details of the molecular basis of fusion are controversial. Several lines of evidence suggest that formation of the v-SNARE·t-SNARE complex catalyzes membrane fusion (23Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H.

However, equally compelling functional studies suggest that the formation of trans-SNARE pairs is required for docking of membranes but does not catalyze fusion (26Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, some molecules required for fusion have been shown to function after SNARE pair formation (21Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Peters C. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Cesaro-Tadic S. Glatz A. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Mayer A. Science. 1999; 285: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, to distinguish between these models, we need to know more about the identity and function of molecules that act after membrane docking.Vac8p is an armadillo (ARM) repeat-containing protein (29Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Pan X. Goldfarb D.S. J.

ARM repeat proteins contain tandem arrays of multiple imperfect repeats. These repeats often have multiple binding partners, and a single ARM protein often has multiple functions (32Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Yeast Vac8p contains 11 ARM repeats and, although not a functional homologue, it is closely related by sequence to plakoglobin and β-catenin. Like plakoglobin and β-catenin, Vac8p has multiple binding partners and interacts with its known partners through its ARM repeats (33Pan X. Roberts P. Chen Y. Kvam E. Shulga N. Huang K. Lemmon S. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2445-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 34Scott S.V. Nice III, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I. Funakoshi T. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25840-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Vac8p is localized on the vacuole membrane and is enriched at vacuole-vacuole contact sites. Vac8p is both myristoylated and palmitoylated.It had been shown that palmitoyl-CoA, by transfer to a target protein(s), stimulates vacuole fusion (7Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation may be a universal requirement for fusion since palmitoyl-CoA also stimulates Golgi vesicle fusion with the Golgi (35Pfanner N. Glick B.S. Arden S.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the role of palmitoyl-CoA had not been well defined.Here, we demonstrate that Vac8p plays a direct role in vacuole fusion both in vivo and in vitro. Vac8p is not necessary for priming and docking but acts after most of the previously identified fusion components and is likely required for fusionper se. Moreover, we show that Vac8p is the target for palmitoyl-CoA and is palmitoylated during the fusion reaction.DISCUSSIONOur discovery that Vac8p is required for homotypic vacuole fusion addresses three questions. 1) Is the act of SNARE pair formation sufficient for membrane fusion? 2) Is membrane fusion coordinated with other membrane-related processes? 3) Is a specialized lipid domain required to promote bilayer mixing, and is this domain brought together with proteins that comprise the fusion machinery?Two major lines of evidence support the prevailing view that formation of the v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex catalyzes membrane fusion. Liposomes containing a purified v-SNARE fuse with liposomes containing purified t-SNARES (23Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar, 25Nickel W. Weber T. McNew J.A. Parlati F. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, structural analysis of the SNARE pair complex suggests that SNARE pairing may be the fundamental event in membrane fusion. The complex forms four parallel helicies with structural similarities between the SNARE complex and viral fusion proteins (for discussion see, Skehel and Wiley (24Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar)).Although SNARE pairing as a catalyst of fusion is an attractive model, several studies indicate that SNARE pairing is not sufficient for fusion. First, functional studies with both yeast vacuoles and sea urchin cortical vesicles demonstrate that when the SNARE complex is disrupted, fusion still proceeds (26Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in synaptosomes, N-ethylmaleimide treatment causes an increase in SNARE pair formation, yet it does not result in a concomitant increase in fusion (28Lonart G. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, staged assays have revealed molecules that function after SNARE pairing, protein phosphatase I (22Peters C. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Cesaro-Tadic S. Glatz A. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Mayer A. Science. 1999; 285: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and Ca2+/calmodulin (21Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar).To build an accurate model of how fusion occurs, the key players in this event need to be identified and characterized. Our studies present a new type of molecule required for fusion. Results from both in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate that Vac8p is required for fusion and strongly suggest that Vac8p functions downstream of SNARE pairing. Most compelling is our finding that trans-SNARE pair formation appears to be normal in Δvac8vacuoles. The SNARE pairs from Δvac8 vacuoles formed within 30 min and to the same extent as that seen with wild-type vacuoles. Although Δvac8 vacuoles are not competent for fusion, they are competent for the earlier steps of priming and docking.Analysis of both the localization and the sequence of Vac8p suggests a model of how Vac8p may function in fusion. Vac8p accumulates at vacuole-vacuole junctions in vivo (30Pan X. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fleckenstein D. Rohde M. Klionsky D.J. Rudiger M. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3109-3118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a site consistent with a direct role in fusion. Vac8p has two types of binding motifs. One motif is composed of 11 ARM repeats of Vac8p. These repeats are found in a diverse set of proteins, have no known catalytic function, and are generally sites of protein-protein interaction. The other motif is composed of acyl chains at the Vac8p amino terminus, and as discussed below, this acylation may bring Vac8p to a specific lipid domain. Thus, an attractive model for Vac8p function is that through its ARM repeats, Vac8p binds the protein portion of the fusion machinery, and when Vac8p is acylated, it brings the protein complex to a specialized lipid domain.In addition to its role in homotypic vacuole fusion presented here, Vac8p is required in at least two other distinct membrane processes, where it interacts with a unique protein partner specific for that process. Vac8p complexes with Apg13p to facilitate the closure of vesicles in the cytoplasm-to-vacuole-targeting pathway (34Scott S.V. Nice III, D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I.

Vac8p complexes with Nvj1p to form specific junctions between the nucleus and vacuole (33Pan X. Roberts P. Chen Y. Kvam E. Shulga N. Huang K. Lemmon S. Goldfarb D.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2445-2457Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The interactions of Vac8p with these proteins are mediated through the Vac8p ARM repeats. Interestingly, the functional role of each of the Vac8p partners above is restricted to a specific process, and none are required for homotypic vacuole fusion. 2J. J. Nau, F. Tang, E. J. Kauffman, and L. S. Weisman, unpublished information. Thus, it is likely that there is a Vac8p binding partner dedicated to homotypic vacuole fusion. Discovery of this partner should provide further insight into the role that Vac8p plays in fusion.That Vac8p is required for multiple vacuole membrane-related events yet acts through several partners suggests that there is a mechanism to prevent these diverse processes from occurring simultaneously. Perhaps each occurs at a similar region of the vacuolar membrane, creating the need to coordinate these events with each other.Are There Functional Homologues of Vac8p?Most of the proteins that have previously been described to play a role in homotypic vacuole fusion have been shown to have direct homologues in other organisms and, moreover, to have direct homologues that function in fusion of other membranes. Although Vac8p homologues are likely to be present in metazoans, none has yet been identified. The difficulty in searching for a Vac8p homologue by sequence alone is that there are at least 25 ARM repeat proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans, 30 in Drosophila melanogaster, and 93 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, there is not just one consensus sequence for palmitoylation. Thus, it is likely that a metazoan Vac8p homologue will need to be identified by functional analysis.Although Vac8p homologues may exist in other organisms, it appears that Vac8p functions in some but not all yeast membrane fusion pathways. The role of Vac8p in nuclear vacuole junction formation and in the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pathway may be a specific function in fusion; however, other yeast membrane fusion events do not appear to require Vac8p. Some membrane fusion events are essential for yeast viability, yet VAC8 is not an essential gene. However, the fact that palmitoyl-CoA stimulates fusion of mammalian Golgi vesicles with the Golgi and also stimulates homotypic vacuole fusion strongly suggests that palmitoyl-CoA provides a general, fundamental role in membrane fusion.What Is the Role of Palmitoyl-CoA in Fusion?The lipid binding motif of Vac8p is composed of Gly2, which is myristoylated, and Cys4, Cys5, and Cys7, which are palmitoylated. Interestingly, the sites of myristoylation and palmitoylation on Vac8p are very similar to those found in the plasma membrane Src-family kinases (29Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, these proteins share a conserved Ser at position 6 and a conserved Lys at position 9. These motifs are not common, and it is tempting to speculate that they serve a similar function in these diverse proteins. In the case of the Src-family kinases, palmitoylation drives them into cholesterol-rich lipid rafts (50Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). By analogy, palmitoylation of Vac8p may bring it (and the fusion machinery that is attached to the ARM repeats of Vac8p) to an ergosterol-rich membrane domain (ergosterol is the sterol in yeast that functions similarly to cholesterol).Properties of cholesterol are consistent with it playing a major role in facilitating fusion. Cholesterol is intercalated in the cytoplasmic side of the phospholipid bilayer and stabilizes the region near the polar hydroxyl group. However, the region of the acyl chains that are most distal from the phospholipid head group are destabilized by the presence of cholesterol, precisely the situation that is expected to accompany bilayer mixing. In addition, cholesterol has been shown to have an important role in viral fusion (for examples, see Kielian and Helenius (51Kielian M.C. Helenius A. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 281-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Chatterjee et al. (52Chatterjee P.K. Vashishtha M. Kielian M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1623-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Moreover, SNARE proteins concentrate at sites of exocytosis in cholesterol-rich domains (53Lang T. Bruns D. Wenzel D. Riedel D. Holroyd P. Thiele C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2202-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed that the Vo subunit of the vacuolar ATPase plays a key role late in fusion (49Peters C. Bayer M. Buhler S. Andersen J. Mann M. Mayer A. Nature. 2001; 409: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Vo subunit of the v-ATPase in synaptic-like vesicles has been shown to be a major protein that cross-links to cholesterol (54Thiele C. Hannah M.J. Fahrenholz F. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).The observation that palmitoylation of Vac8p is required for fusion strongly suggests that this region of Vac8p attaches to a defined membrane patch that promotes bilayer mixing. Determination of the composition of this patch is likely to yield further insight into the final steps in fusion. Homotypic organelle fusion is essential for the maintenance of organelle structure, copy number, and function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lysosome (vacuole) homotypic fusion is involved in three distinct aspects of vacuole biogenesis. First, during cell division the mother cell vacuoles form vesicular/tubular segregation structures that migrate into the daughter cells and fuse to establish a new vacuole (1Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986; 234: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 2Weisman L.S. Wickner W. Science. 1988; 241: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 3Weisman L.S.

Cytol. 1992; 139: 59-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Second, during zygote formation the segregation structures from each mother cell fuse, generating the bud vacuole and exchanging vacuole material (2Weisman L.S. Wickner W. Science. 1988; 241: 589-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Third, yeast vacuoles undergo regulated rapid fission and fusion events. This allows yeast cells to rapidly change the volume of the vacuole in response to changes in osmolarity of their environment. Development of an in vitro vacuole fusion assay (6Conradt B. Shaw J.

Biochem. 2000; 69: 247-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) reveal three distinct events in the vacuole fusion pathway: priming, docking, and fusion. Several molecules required for priming and docking have been identified. However, details of the molecular basis of fusion are controversial. Several lines of evidence suggest that formation of the v-SNARE·t-SNARE complex catalyzes membrane fusion (23Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Sollner T.H.

A. 1999; 96: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, equally compelling functional studies suggest that the formation of trans-SNARE pairs is required for docking of membranes but does not catalyze fusion (26Coorssen J.R. Blank P.S. Tahara M. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 27Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27703-27707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, some molecules required for fusion have been shown to function after SNARE pair formation (21Peters C. Mayer A. Nature. 1998; 396: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 22Peters C. Andrews P.D. Stark M.J. Cesaro-Tadic S. Glatz A. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Mayer A. Science. 1999; 285: 1084-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, to distinguish between these models, we need to know more about the identity and function of molecules that act after membrane docking. Vac8p is an armadillo (ARM) repeat-containing protein (29Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Pan X. Goldfarb D.S. J.

ARM repeat proteins contain tandem arrays of multiple imperfect repeats. These repeats often have multiple binding partners, and a single ARM protein often has multiple functions (32Peifer M. Wieschaus E. Cell. 1990; 63: 1167-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Yeast Vac8p contains 11 ARM repeats and, although not a functional homologue, it is closely related by sequence to plakoglobin and β-catenin. Like plakoglobin and β-catenin, Vac8p has multiple binding partners and interacts with its known partners through its ARM repeats (33Pan X. Roberts P. Chen Y. Kvam E. Shulga N. Huang K. Lemmon S.

Vac8p is localized on the vacuole membrane and is enriched at vacuole-vacuole contact sites. Vac8p is both myristoylated and palmitoylated. It had been shown that palmitoyl-CoA, by transfer to a target protein(s), stimulates vacuole fusion (7Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3296-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Palmitoylation may be a universal requirement for fusion since palmitoyl-CoA also stimulates Golgi vesicle fusion with the Golgi (35Pfanner N. Glick B.S. Arden S.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the role of palmitoyl-CoA had not been well defined. Here, we demonstrate that Vac8p plays a direct role in vacuole fusion both in vivo and in vitro. Vac8p is not necessary for priming and docking but acts after most of the previously identified f"

Evidence suggests that PcG complexes are heterogeneous with respect to both protein composition and specific function. MPc3 is a recently described mouse Polycomb (Pc) protein that shares structural homology with at least two other Pc proteins, M33 and MPc2. All three Pc proteins bind another PcG protein, RING1, through a conserved carboxy-terminal C-box motif. Here, data are presented demonstrating that MPc3 also interacts with AF9, a transcriptional activator implicated in the development of acute leukemias. The carboxy-terminus of AF9 is fused to the MLL protein in leukemias characterized by t(9;11)(p22;q23) chromosomal translocations. Importantly, it is the carboxy-terminus of AF9 to which MPc3 binds. The AF9 binding site of MPc3 maps to a central, non-conserved, region of the polypeptide sequence. In contrast to MPc3, data indicate that the Pc protein M33 does not interact with AF9. This finding suggests a potentially unique role for MPc3 in linking a PcG silencing complex to a transcriptional activator protein."

https://openalex.org/W2325884738,"The Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and its receptor Met are physiological regulators of cell migration. HGF and Met have also been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. We show here that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 has a stimulatory effect on HGF-induced migration and branching morphogenesis in thyroid cancer but not in primary or immortalized thyroid epithelial cells. These stimulatory effects of STI571 are observed at a concentration that is clinically relevant. The STI571-enhanced motile response can be correlated with an increase in the Met receptor tyrosine phosphorylation as well as ERK and Akt activation by HGF. Interestingly, one of the targets of STI571, namely the c-Abl tyrosine kinase, is activated by HGF and is recruited at the migrating edge of thyroid cancer cells. These data suggests that c-Abl and/or STI571-inhibited tyrosine kinases can negatively regulate the Met receptor to restrain the motile response in thyroid cancer cells."

To determine the mechanism(s) of tal-1-induced leukemogenesis, we created transgenic mice expressing a DNA binding mutant of tal-1. Surprisingly, these mice develop disease, demonstrating that the DNA binding properties of tal-1 are not required to induce leukemia/lymphoma in mice. However, wild type tal-1 and the DNA binding mutant both form stable complexes with E2A proteins. In addition, tal-1 stimulates differentiation of CD8-single positive thymocytes but inhibits the development of CD4-single positive cells: effects also observed in E2A-deficient mice.

The former are oncogenes such as Myc or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)1-related tyrosine kinase ERBB2/HER2, which, when overexpressed or mutated, exacerbate a normal function leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation or defects of apoptosis. The latter are products of tumor suppressor genes whose loss of function unleashes a cell regulatory mechanism controlling DNA repair, cell cycling, adhesion, or polarity as in the case of p53 or adenomatous polyposis coli (1Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). Mutations of oncogenes and tumor suppressors alter the highly organized structure of epithelial tissues maintained by specialized junctions (adherens and tight junctions and desmosomes) and promote loss of cell-cell contacts, cell growth dysregulation, and invasion of healthy tissues by tumor cells (2Jouanneau J. Tucker G.C. Boyer B. Valles A.M. Thiery J.-P. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 525-529PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane-associated LAP proteins are recently characterized adaptor proteins important for homeostasis of epithelial tissues and cell transformation. Only present in Eucaryotes, they contain 16 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), an LAP-specific domain (LAPSD) carboxyl-terminal to the LRR, and either one or four PDZ (PSD95/DLG/ZO-1) domains (see Fig.1A) (3Bilder D.

Recent genetic analyses have unraveled the role of LAP proteins encoded by scribble in Drosophila melanogaster and let-413 in Caenorhabditis elegans.

They share a common modular organization and a basolateral distribution (except for Densin-180, a brain-specific protein) in epithelial cells but bind to a variety of interactors (see Fig.1 A). For example, Erbin binds to ERBB2/HER2 in epithelial cells and neurons and is required for the proper basolateral localization of the receptor (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V.

More is known about MAGUK, because it was one of the first described PDZ domain protein families. MAGUKs have three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a guanylate kinase domain that interact with a variety of receptors, including the ERBB4/HER4 tyrosine kinase receptor, or cytosolic proteins (NOS and SynGAP) in neurons and epithelial cells (10Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the MAGUK DLG (DiscLarge) is crucial for the neuromuscular junction formation but also acts as a tumor suppressor in epithelial cells (11Lahey T. Gorczyca M. Jia X.X. Budnik V. Neuron. 1994; 13: 823-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 12Wood D.F. Bryant P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 451-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). In humans, hDLG may participate in epithelial carcinogenesis by interacting with adenomatous polyposis coli and impinging on cell cycle events (13Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a genetic interaction exists betweenscribble and dlg, because loss of function of either gene gives rise to similar overgrowth of epithelial cells of imaginal discs (6Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this MAGUK-LAP connection also exists in nematode, because mutations of let-413 ordlg-1 perturbate very similarly epithelial integrity (15McMahon, L., Legouis, R., Vonesch, J.-L., and Labouesse, M. (2001)J. Cell Sci., in press.Google Scholar,16Bossinger O. Klebes A. Segbert C. Theres C. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although it is doubtless that these two protein families somehow belong to a common pathway, it remains unclear whether LAP and MAGUK proteins belong to the same protein complexes. The LAPSD is a signature unique to the LAP protein family. In this study, we identified a novel mammalian LAPSD-containing protein we called Lano and ascribed to the LAP family. Like Erbin and hScribble, Lano is located to the basolateral side of epithelial cells where it interacts with MAGUK proteins through a PDZ domain interaction. This interaction is direct and specific as shown by multiple in vivo and in vitro binding assays. Lano can alternatively bind to Erbin in an indirect manner. We show that a direct connection exists between two tumor suppressor families creating protein complexes likely to be important for epithelial homeostasis and cell transformation. COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 100 unit·ml−1 penicillin and 100 µg·ml−1streptomycin sulfate, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Caco-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% non-essential amino acids.

PSD95, hDLG/SAP97, and KIAA0147 (partial humanScribble) cDNAs were used as templates to create GST proteins fused to the respective PDZ domains. GST-hDLG and GST-PSD95 contain the three PDZ domains of the respective MAGUKs. GST-hScribble contains the four PDZ domains of the protein. KIAA0147 was cloned in frame in a pCDNA-HA vector to produce an HA-hScribble protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene) or polymerase chain reaction procedures. Human ESTs (240458, 155940, and 2367589) and Dario rerio EST AW343020 were provided by Ressourcenzentrum Primardaten Bank (Berlin, Germany), and the Xenopus laeviESTs (4082928, 4078620, and 4072466) were provided by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). All constructs were sequenced by Genome Express, SA (Grenoble, France). Northern blot analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a multiple tissues Northern Blot (CLONTECH) and a humanlano probe. Anti-HA 3F10 and anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibodies are from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Oncogene Research Products, respectively. The mouse monoclonal anti-hDLG (2D11) and pan anti-MAGUK antibodies are from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and Dako, respectively. An anti-hScribble polyclonal antibody was produced by injecting the RALSPAELRALEAEK keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide to rabbits. Two anti-Lano polyclonal antibodies were produced by injecting the NEVNHAIDRVTTSV keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide (anti-Lano) or recombinant GST-Lano (anti-Lano.rec) to rabbits. Anti-Lano antibodies were subsequently affinity-purified on an Affi-Gel-10 column (BioRad). Immunostainings on Caco-2 cells were done as described previously (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A.

For immunoelectron microscopy, immediately after removal, biopsies of human colon were fixed at room temperature in 8% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were then infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were prepared using a cryo-ultramicrotome and collected on formwar-coated grids. Sections were successively treated for 30 min with PBS, for 20 min with 0.5 mNH4Cl in PBS, and for 30 min with PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Lano and anti-hDLG (2D11) antibodies diluted 1:20 or 1:5 in 5% goat serum in PBS, respectively. Primary antibodies were revealed by incubation for 1 h with colloidal gold 6 or 15 nm-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, respectively, diluted 1:25 in 5% goat serum in PBS. After washing, sections were rapidly fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, stained for 6 min with 2% uranyl acetate, rinsed, and treated with 0.3% uranyl acetate and 1.8% methylcellulose in bi-distilled water on ice. Sections were air-dried and examined under a Zeiss electron microscope. In searching for new LAPSD-containing proteins in data bases, we identified in the human genome several mammalian ESTs encoding a unique protein similar to hScribble and Erbin (3Bilder D. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Bryant P. Huigbretse J. Jansen E. Kennedy M.B. Labouesse M. Legouis R. Mechler B. Perrimon N. Petit N. Sinha P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 114Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This new LAP protein contains 16 LRRs and an LAPSD but no PDZ and was thus christened Lano for LAP and no PDZ domain (Fig.1, A and B). Despite a lack of PDZ domain, we will refer to Lano as an LAP protein, because phylogenetic studies ascribed it to this protein family (data not shown). In comparing full-length LAP proteins, the closest similarity is found with hScribble (60% identity) whereas rat Densin-180 and human Erbin share 42 and 40% identity with Lano, respectively. A lano gene exists in X. laevi and in D. rerio, and they both encode a protein 78 and 75% identical to human Lano, respectively. No Lano was identified in C. elegans and D. melanogastergenomes. The human Lano gene maps to the 6p12.2–12.3 chromosomal band whereas Erbin, Densin-180, andhScribble map on human chromosomes 5, 1, and 8, respectively. A Northern blot analysis showed that LanomRNA is widely expressed in tissues with a predominant expression in placenta, kidney, pancreas, prostate, testis, colon, thyroid, and adrenergic glands (Fig. 1 C). We produced two rabbit anti-Lano antibodies directed against a peptide (anti-Lano) or a recombinant GST-Lano (anti-Lano.rec) that recognized Lano but not Erbin or hScribble LAP proteins (Fig. 1 D). Lano was detected as a 62-kDa protein in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1 E), as well as in various mouse tissues (data not shown) by anti-Lano antibodies. Lano is thus the fourth mammalian LAP protein described to date (Fig.1 A). Absence of Lano in worms and flies may suggest that this novel LAP protein triggers functions specific to vertebrates. PDZ domains of mammalian LAP proteins are class I domains (Fig.1 A) that interact with membrane receptors containing a carboxyl-terminal (S/T)XV motif (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Lano contains a carboxyl-terminal TSV motif conserved in vertebrates (zebrafish, xenope, bovine, mouse, and human) matching a canonical class I PDZ domain binding site (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, the Lano carboxyl-terminal sequence (RVTTSV) is very similar to the neuroligin carboxyl-terminal motif (HSTTRV), a known target for MAGUK PDZ domains (18Irie M. Hata Y. Takeuchi M. Ichtchenko K. Toyoda A. Hirao K. Takai Y. Rosahl T.W. Sudhof T.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This structural feature prompted us to evaluate whether a biochemical interaction existed between Lano and MAGUK proteins. To do so, we fused Lano to an HA tag and transiently expressed the protein in COS-1 cells. GST proteins encompassing PDZ domains were used to pull down proteins from lysates. After Western blot using anti-HA antibody, we demonstrated that Lano bound to MAGUK hDLG and PSD95 PDZ domains but not to LIN-2, AF6, Densin-180 (Fig.2, A and B), and hScribble (not shown) PDZ domains. Similar results were obtained with endogenous Lano from Caco-2 cell lysates (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the Erbin PDZ domain also precipitated Lano from the lysates (Fig. 2, A and B). Interaction with PDZ domains was completely abrogated by deleting the three last residues of Lano (ΔLano) to eliminate the PDZ domain binding site (Fig.2 A). We concluded that Lano has a bona fide PDZ domain binding site interacting with MAGUK and Erbin proteins. We also produced GST-Lano and -ΔLano and precipitated proteins from a Caco-2 lysate. Bound proteins were revealed by a monoclonal anti-MAGUK protein family antibody that recognizes PSD95, PSD93, hDLG, and Chapsyn-110 MAGUKs. MAGUKs were precipitated by GST-Lano but not by GST-ΔLano (Fig. 2 C). We also showed that Erbin, but not hScribble, was precipitated by a GST-Lano recombinant protein (Fig.2 C). Taken together, our results demonstrate that Lano, a new LAP protein, interacts with MAGUKs and Erbin proteins. To determine whether Lano interacted directly with MAGUKs and Erbin, we used the two-hybrid system in yeast using PDZ domains as preys and Lano as a bait. In L40 yeast, PSD95 and hDLG PDZ domains interacted with Lano and Lano carboxyl-terminal peptide, as well as to ERBB4/HER4 and E6 control peptides (Fig. 3A) (19Garcia R.A. Vasudevan K. Buonanno A.

No interaction was demonstrated between the Erbin PDZ domain and Lano whereas Erbin bound to an ERBB2/HER2 control peptide (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F.

Huibregtse J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8244-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 23Reymond N. Borg J.-P. Lecocq E. Adelaide J. Campadelli-Fiume G. Dubreuil P. Lopez M. Gene. 2000; 255: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data showed that the MAGUK PDZ domains directly interact with Lano. Failure to evidence the Erbin-Lano interaction by two-hybrid could be because of an indirect binding between these two LAP proteins. To test this possibility, we did a pull-down assay on SDS-treated and boiled Caco-2 lysates to disrupt preformed protein complexes present in cell extracts. This treatment abolished the Erbin-Lano, but not the hDLG-Lano, interaction (Fig. 3 B) confirming that Erbin indirectly interacted with Lano in cells. MAGUKs do not bridge Lano to Erbin, because we failed to coimmunoprecipitate Erbin and MAGUKs in epithelial cells (data not shown) and to precipitate MAGUKs with a GST-Erbin PDZ domain (Fig. 3 C). These results suggested that a tripartite Lano-MAGUK-Erbin complex is unlikely to exist. We conclude that Erbin and MAGUKs bind to two distinct pools of Lano in epithelial cells (Fig. 3 D). To demonstrate that these interactions occur in vivo, we immunoprecipitated Lano from a Caco-2 cell lysate with two anti-Lano antibodies (see Fig. 1 E), and bound proteins were revealed with anti-MAGUK antibody. MAGUK proteins interacted in vivowith Lano (Fig. 4A,upper panel). Reprobing with anti-Lano antibody confirmed that Lano was present in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 A,lower panel). Likewise, Erbin coimmunoprecipitated with Lano in the lysates (Fig. 4 B). Thus, both MAGUKs and Erbin bind to Lano in epithelial cells. hDLG MAGUK and Erbin are membrane-associated basolateral proteins in epithelial cells (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V.

Garner C.C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2365-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the subcellular localization of Lano in epithelial cells, we performed immunostaining and confocal sections of permeabilized Caco-2 cells with anti-Lano antibody. The anti-Lano.rec antibody nicely decorated the basolateral membrane of Caco-2 cells and did not overlap with the immunostaining of anti-carcinoma embryonic antigen, an apical specific marker (Fig.4 C). We used anti-hDLG (clone 2D11) monoclonal and anti-Lano.rec polyclonal antibodies in double immunostainings and observed colocalization between these two proteins at the lateral plasma membrane in Z sections (Fig. 4 D). This was confirmed using immunoelectron microscopy on frozen section of human colon. Lano was observed close to the lateral membranes where it partially colocalized with hDLG (Fig. 4 E). A very similar pattern of distribution was observed with Erbin. 2J.-P. A. and A. L. B., personal communication. Together with our binding studies, these results demonstrate that Lano is associated to LAP and MAGUK proteins at the basolateral side of epithelial cells. In non-vertebrates, MAGUKs and LAP proteins belong to a common pathway crucial for apico-basolateral polarity of epithelial cells (6Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N. Science. 2000; 289: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 15McMahon, L., Legouis, R., Vonesch, J.-L., and Labouesse, M. (2001)J. Cell Sci., in press.Google Scholar, 16Bossinger O. Klebes A. Segbert C. Theres C. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that physical interactions exist between members of these protein families in mammals. Although we failed to prove an interaction between MAGUKs and Erbin in epithelial cells, a PSD95-Erbin interaction has recently been demonstrated in neurons suggesting that interaction between these proteins may be cell type-dependent (9Huang Y.Z. Wang Q. Xiong W.C. Mei L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19318-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Taken together, LAP and MAGUK, two important protein families involved in epithelial homeostasis and cell transformation, form various protein complexes at the lateral side of epithelial cells. It is interesting to point out that Erbin and MAGUKs bind different subsets of EGFR members in epithelial cells and neurons through PDZ domain interactions (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although its role remains to be appreciated, Lano may have a dominant-negative effect toward other LAP proteins because of a lack of a protein interaction domain,i.e. the PDZ domain, as shown in other protein families (25Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). For example, Lano may serve as a regulator by competing with EGFR members for binding to Erbin and hDLG PDZ domains. Hence, a variety of LAP-MAGUK complexes may be linked to mammalian EGFR family members (ERBB2/HER2 with Erbin and ERBB4/HER4 with PSD95) at the basolateral side of epithelial cells and at the post-synaptic membrane in neurons and may regulate their functions. In C. elegans, LET-23, the orthologue of EGFR, is targeted to the basolateral side of vulval epithelial cells by a PDZ domain complex unrelated to MAGUK and LAP (26Kaech S. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, scribble and let-413genes are crucial for the proper subcellular localization of membrane-associated proteins (4Bilder D. Perrimon N. Nature. 2000; 403: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 5Legouis R. Gansmuller A. Sookhareea S. Bosher J.M. Baillie D.L. Labouesse M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In mammals, routing or retention of EGFR species at specific subcellular domains of the plasma membrane may rely on LAP-MAGUK networks. Accordingly, Erbin retains ERBB2/HER2 at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells (7Borg J.-P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adélaı̈de J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 7: 407-414Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This idea is strengthened by the genetic link existing between scribbleor dlg and l(2)gl, a gene encoding a cortical protein important for vesicle trafficking and protein transport (6Bilder D. Li M.

Although further studies are necessary to provide a better understanding of the functions of these protein networks, we speculate that LAP proteins act as central molecules in the biological processes mediated by EGFR growth factor receptors. Future studies will also appreciate how, in binding to tumor suppressors (hDLG) and oncogenes (EGFR), LAP proteins may participate to epithelial cell transformation.

Whereas the melanogenic functions of TRPs are localized in their amino-terminal domains that reside within the lumen of melanosomes, the sorting and targeting of these proteins to melanosomes is mediated by signals in their cytoplasmic domains. To identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 (TRP-1), the most abundant melanosomal membrane protein, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a melanocyte cDNA library. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic domain of gp75 interacts with a PDZ domain-containing protein. The gp75-interacting protein is identical to GIPC, an RGS (regulator of G protein signaling)/GAIP-interacting protein, and to SEMCAP-1, a transmembrane semaphorin-binding protein. Carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues, Ser-Val-Val, of gp75 are necessary and sufficient for interaction of gp75 with the single PDZ domain in GIPC. Although endogenous and transfected GIPCs bind efficiently to transiently expressed gp75, only a small amount of GIPC is found associated with gp75 at steady state. Using a strategy to selectively synchronize the biosynthesis of endogenous gp75, we demonstrate that only newly synthesized gp75 associates with GIPC, primarily in the juxtanuclear Golgi region.

There is evidence that amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of tyrosinase and TRPs contribute to their biological properties. For example, the phosphorylation of serine residues (Ser505and Ser509) in the cytoplasmic tail of tyrosinase by protein kinase C-β seems to augment the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase (19Park H.-Y. Perez J.M. Laursen R. Hara M. Gilchrest B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16470-16478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 have been shown to determine the intracellular stability and export from the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting the presence of several signals for intracellular transport in the cytoplasmic tail (20Xu Y. Vijayasaradhi S. Houghton A.N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 110: 324-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Thus, through their interactions with cytosolic proteins, cytoplasmically exposed amino acid sequences seem to influence the biological functions of mammalian pigmentation-related proteins. In this study, by using the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 as bait for yeast two-hybrid screening we identified a PDZ domain-containing protein, GIPC/SEMCAP-1 (referred to as GIPC hereafter), as a gp75-interacting protein. GIPC, which was identified earlier based on its interaction with GAIP, a regulator of G protein signaling (21De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Fraquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and as neural semaphorin-interacting protein SEMCAP-1 (22Wang L.-H. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14137-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), binds specifically to the carboxyl terminus of newly synthesized gp75 but not tyrosinase. Binding of GIPC with the melanosomal gp75 during biosynthesis suggests a possible role for this interaction in intracellular sorting and targeting of melanosomal membrane proteins. For bait plasmid construction a DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the plasmid pSVK3hgp75 containing the full-length gp75 cDNA (14Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) as template and primers with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites and cloned into EcoRI-XhoI-digested pHybLex/Zeo plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to produce an in-frame fusion cDNA with the LexA DNA-binding domain protein. The transformation ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 and selection of Zeocin-resistant colonies were performed according to manufacturer instructions. Zeocin-resistant colonies were transformed with the reporter plasmid pSH18–34 (Invitrogen). The transformants were selected on Zeo+/Ura− plates and then plated on Zeo+/ura −/leu− plates containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, and 80 mg/ml X-gal to test background activation of the reporter genes by the bait fusion protein alone. The human melanocyte cDNA library cloned in pJG vector (Invitrogen) as B42 activation domain fusion constructs was a gift from Dr. Tony Zervos (Cutaneous Biology Research Center, Cambridge, MA). A freshly isolated colony of EGY48 transformant selected for bait and β-galactosidase (β-gal) plasmids was transformed with 150 μg of melanocyte cDNA library plasmid. Aliquots (200 μg) of the transformation mixture containing a total of 13.6 × 106 transformants were plated on 40 Zeo+/Ura−/Trp− plates containing 2% dextrose and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. An amplified library was titered and stored at −80 °C. The transformants were screened for the interacting proteins by plating 1.15 × 108colony-forming units on 40 gal+/raf+/ura−/trp−/leu−/Zeo+plates (150 mm) containing X-gal. Blue colonies that appeared on day 3 of incubation were marked and allowed to grow for 2 more days. All 27 positive clones obtained were analyzed further after restreaking on selection plates. pJG plasmids containing library inserts were isolated from two colonies of each positive clone and used to transformEscherichia coli DH5α. Plasmids isolated from four ampicillin-resistant colonies were analyzed by restriction digestion and sequencing. For the construction of mutant gp75 and tyrosinase (tyr) bait plasmids, DNA fragments encoding a truncated cytoplasmic tail of gp75 lacking the four carboxyl-terminal amino acids QSVV and mutant tyrosinase tail with the two carboxyl-terminal residues (His-Leu) converted to Val were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the following pairs of primers and cloned in a pHybLex/Zeo plasmid (Invitrogen): for gp75 carboxyl-terminal QSVV deletion mutant, 5′ primer (5′-GAGGCCGAATTCAAGCTTCGTGCC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAATTAGGATTCTG-3′); for tyrosinase cytoplasmic tail, 5′ primer (5′-GAGG CCGAATTCCGTCACAAGAGA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATAAATGGCTCTG-3′); and for tyrosinase carboxyl-terminal substitution, 5′ primer (5′-GAGGCCGAATTCCGTCACAAGAGA-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGACCACGCT- CTGATACAA-3′). Three colonies of yeast EGY48 transformed with the plasmids pJG-GIPC, pSH18–34, and pHybLexA containing wild-type or mutant cDNA inserts of gp75 or tyrosinase were grown overnight in Zeo+/ura−/trp−/dextrose medium. Cultures were diluted to an A 600 of 0.4 in the selection medium Zeo+/leu−/ura−/trp−with galactose and raffinose and incubated for 6–10 h at 30 °C until the A 600 reached 0.5–0.8. The cells were collected, washed, and suspended in phosphate buffer in a volume equivalent to one-fifth of the culture volume, and the β-gal assays were performed according to manufacturer instructions (CLONTECH). Units of β-gal activity were calculated as units = 1,000 ×A 420/(color development time (min) × culture volume used (ml) × A 600). Full-length gp75 cDNA was cloned in pCMV5a vector (Sigma). A 0.7-kb cDNA encoding the 243-amino acid-long partial GIPC fragment lacking the amino-terminal sequences (NH2ΔGIPC), identified by yeast two-hybrid screening, and a 1.0-kb fragment encoding the entire open reading frame of 333-amino acid residues of GIPC were amplified from human melanoma cDNA using GIPC-specific primers (GenBankTM accession no. AF089816) that incorporate 5′-HindIII and 3′-XbaI (following the stop codon) or 3′-KpnI (without the stop codon) restriction sites were cloned into pFLAG-CMV vectors (Sigma) to produce amino- or carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged GIPC proteins. A gp75/tyrosinase chimera was constructed using the following strategy. Briefly, a mutant tyrosinase expression plasmid pSVK3hTyr containing a HindIII site at the junction of the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic domains was constructed, from which a HindIII-XbaI DNA fragment encoding the cytoplasmic domain and the 3′-untranslated sequences of tyrosinase was isolated and ligated to the large pSVK3hgp75 plasmid fragment containing the lumenal and transmembrane domains of gp75. This resulted in an expression plasmid encoding a chimeric gp75 with the cytoplasmic tail of tyrosinase. The chimeric cDNA was sequenced to confirm restoration of the tyrosinase open reading frame. Polymerase chain reaction-amplified full-length GIPC was cloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GIPC fusion protein. The fusion protein for the immunization of rabbits was prepared using GST bulk-purification modules according to manufacturer instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-GIPC fusion protein was purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography followed by elution from acrylamide gels. Immunization of rabbits with the GST-GIPC protein was performed by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Briefly, rabbits were immunized with 100 μg of purified protein mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. After three booster injections of 50 μg of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, sera were obtained and tested for anti-GIPC reactivity by Western blotting. Two weeks after the third boost, responding rabbits were boosted twice at 1-week intervals, and serum was collected 1 week after the last boost by sacrificing the animal. For the isolation of anti-GIPC IgG, sera were first precleared with GST-Sepharose, and IgG from GST-precleared preimmune and immune sera was purified using protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GIPC-specific IgG was isolated by GST-GIPC-Sepharose affinity chromatography (23Youssoufian H. BioTechniques. 1997; 24: 198-202Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). GST-precleared sera were used for immunoblotting analyses, and GST-precleared IgG fraction or GST-GIPC affinity-purified IgG were used for immunofluorescence staining. The isolation and culture of human neonatal foreskin melanocytes was described earlier (24Fang D. Setaluri V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Human pigmented metastatic melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-19 and SK-MEL-23. cl.22 (clone 22) and the nonpigmented gp75-negative SK-MEL-23. cl.22a (clone 22a) cell line were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum/RPMI 1640 medium. Other primary (WM75, WM35, and WM98-1) and metastatic (WM451/451Lu and WM1205) melanoma cell lines were cultured as described (24Fang D. Setaluri V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Detergent lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 15,000 × g for 20 min. For preparation of cytosolic and membrane-bound proteins, cells were resuspended in PBS containing protein inhibitor mixture and lysed by freeze/thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C, the cytosol fraction was collected and adjusted to 1% Triton X-100. The membrane pellet was solubilized in lysis buffer and cleared as described above. In experiments to determine the nature of membrane-associated GIPC, the membrane fraction was washed with buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl for 1 h and centrifuged at 100,000 × g (25Christgau S. Schierbeck H. Aanstoot H.J. Aagaard L. Begley K. Kofod H. Hejnaes K. Baekkeskov S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21257-21264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatant was collected, and the membrane pellet was lysed and cleared as described above. Nuclei were isolated, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (26Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999Google Scholar). SK-MEL-19 melanoma cells were harvested, resuspended in gradient buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture), homogenized in Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min in gradient buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose. The postnuclear supernatant was fractionated by discontinuous sucrose density gradient as described (27Radke K. Carter C. Moss P. Dehazya P. Schliwa M. Martin G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1601-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Fractions (1 ml) were collected from the top and stored at −20 °C until used for immunoblot analysis. Fraction 12, which included the pellet obtained at the bottom of the tube, presumably consisting cellular debris, contained all proteins analyzed and is not shown. COS-7 and clone 22a melanoma cells were co-transfected with 8 μg of pCMV5a-gp75 or pCMV5a-gp75/tyr (chimeric gp75 with tyrosinase cytoplasmic tail) or 18 μg of pSVK3-gp75Δ14 (gp75 truncated its last 14 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail) and 2 μg of pCMV5a-full-length GIPC-FLAG or pCMV5a-NH2ΔGIPC-FLAG plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer instructions. pCMV2-FLAG-control (an unrelated 82-kDa soluble protein, 2 μg) was used for control transfections. After 36 h of transfection, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described above. Clear centrifuged lysates were incubated with mAb TA99 (∼6 μg/ml) on ice for 2 h followed by protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma). Melanoma cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 5 mmhexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) for 5 days and harvested immediately or after allowing to recover from HMBA treatment for 8–48 h. gp75 in detergent lysates was precipitated with mAb TA99, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer, and GIPC in the immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblot analysis with anti-GIPC serum. Proteins from cell lysates, cell fractions, sucrose fractions, and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After blocking with 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies diluted in TBS (anti-gp75 mAb TA99 (hybridoma supernatant at 1:10), anti-tyrosinase mAb NCL-TYROS (1:250, Novocastra, Burlingame, CA), anti-clathrin heavy chain mAb TD.1 (1:500, BabCo, Richmond, CA), anti-adaptin γ mAb clone 88 (1:2,500, Transduction Laboratory, Lexington, KY), anti-LAMP-1 mAb H4A3 (1:10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IO), anti-FLAG mAb M2 (1:500, Sigma)) or diluted in TBS-T (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) (anti-GIPC (1:500), anti-γ tubulin (1:5,000, Sigma)). After three washes with TBS or TBS-T, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted in TBS or TBS-T at 1:5,000, and protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SK-MEL-19 and clone 22 cells plated in 8-well chamber slides were left untreated or treated with 5 mm HMBA for 5 days and then allowed to recover from HMBA treatment for 15 or 36 h. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST-precleared or affinity-purified anti-GIPC IgG and preimmune IgG (1:20). After washing and incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h, the cells were finally stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-gp75 mAb TA99 (1:40) for 1 h at room temperature. Golgi structures were visualized by staining with red (Alexa 594) and green (Alexa 488) fluorescent dye-conjugated Golgi-specific lectin GS-II (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which recognizes nonreducing α- or β-linkedN-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues. After each antibody incubation, the cells were washed for 15 min with three changes of 1% Triton X-100/PBS. Immunofluorescence was captured using a laser scanning confocal image system (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). We employed the yeast two-hybrid method to screen a human melanocyte cDNA expression library with a LexA DNA-binding domain-gp75 cytoplasmic tail fusion protein as bait. We obtained 27 positive clones from 13 × 106 primary transformants. DNA sequence analysis showed that these 16 positive clones contained two overlapping cDNAs of 1,437 and 1,348 base pairs differing at their 5′ ends. Fig. 1 A shows two representative yeast clones streaked on leucine-deficient (leu−) plates. In the absence of galactose (gal), which is required for the expression of the prey protein, yeast clones failed to grow on leu−/dextrose-containing plates (Fig.1 A,leu−/dex+). Thus, the growth of these clones on leu− plates (Fig. 1 A,leu−/gal+) and activation of the β-gal reporter gene (Fig. 1 A,leu−/gal+/X-gal) depend on the expression and interaction of the protein product encoded by melanocyte-derived cDNA with the LexA-gp75 tail fusion protein. A BLAST search of GenBankTM data base using the 243-amino acid sequence predicted from the 1.4-kb partial melanocyte cDNA showed sequence identity with three PDZ domain-containing mammalian protein entries. These are 1) a protein fragment encoded by TIP-2 (GenBankTM accession no. AF02884), a cDNA isolated by yeast two-hybrid screen using human T cell leukemia virus transactivator Tax as a bait (28Rousset R. Fabre S. Desbois C. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), 2) a human homologue of GIPC (GenBankTM accession no. AF089816), a protein identified by virtue of its binding intracellular Gαi3-interacting protein RGS-GAIP (21De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Fraquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12340-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and 3) SEMCAP-1 (GenBankTM accession no. AF061263), a neural semaphorin-binding protein (22Wang L.-H. Kalb R.G. Strittmatter S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14137-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The gp75-interacting protein fragment contained a PDZ domain. This domain, which was originally identified in the post-synaptic density proteinPSD-95, disc large protein (Dlg) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), consists of a stretch of 80–90-amino acid residues. PDZ domain proteins are known to interact with the cytoplasmic tails of membrane proteins and are found in all eukaryotic organisms ranging from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans (reviewed in Refs. 29Saras J. Heldin C.-H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 30Garner C.C. Nash J. Huganir R.L.

A. 2001; 98: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). That the interaction of the protein fragment encoded by GIPC cDNA with the cytoplasmic tail of melanocyte-specific gp75 may also be mediated by the PDZ domain is suggested by the following observations. First, class I PDZ domain proteins, including GIPC, are known to specifically bind the carboxyl-terminal amino acid motif Xaa-Ser/Thr-Xaa-Val (where Xaa is any amino acid). The carboxyl-terminal sequence of gp75 is Gln-Ser-Val-Val (14Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Second, the protein fragment encoded by all the 16 partial cDNAs contained no protein-protein interaction domain other than the PDZ domain. To test whether the full-length, intracellular transmembrane gp75 also interacts with GIPC, we cloned 0.7- and 1.0-kb GIPC cDNAs encoding partial and complete open reading frames in the pFLAG-CMV plasmid to generate FLAG-epitope fusion proteins. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the gp75 cDNA expression plasmid together with partial and full-length GIPC-FLAG fusion proteins. Detergent lysates of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with gp75-specific mAb TA99. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Fig.1 B) showed that both the partial ∼28-kDa ΔNH2GIPC and full-length 38-kDa GIPC co-precipitated with gp75 (lanes 1 and 3 in the upper panel). No M2 antibody-reactive proteins were precipitated from detergent extracts of cells cotransfected with either empty vector pFLAG (Fig.1 B, lane 2 in the upper panel) or the unrelated control protein control-FLAG fusion plasmid pControl-FLAG (Fig. 1 B, lane 4 in the upper panel ). These data show that the PDZ domain of GIPC efficiently binds intracellular membrane-bound gp75. In melanocytic cells, the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 is involved in the sorting and targeting of this protein to melanosomes. Therefore, we tested whether in melanocytic cells the cytoplasmic tail of gp75 is accessible for interaction with GIPC. We used a nonpigmented gp75-negative melanoma cell line clone 22a to coexpress FLAG-GIPC with either full-length gp75 or a deletion mutant lacking carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acid (ΔC14). In earlier studies we showed that 1) the deletion of carboxyl-terminal amino acids of gp75 does not affect its recognition by anti-gp75 mAb TA99 and 2) in transiently transfected melanoma cells, ΔC14 mutant, which lacks the PDZ-binding motif but contains the endosomes/lysosomes sorting signal, displays an intracellular distribution similar but not identical to the wild-type protein (14Vijayasaradhi S. Xu Y. Bouchard B. Houghton A.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 807-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Detergent extracts of transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-gp75 mAb TA99 and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Fig.2, upper panel). In cells coexpressing wild-type gp75 and GIPC-FLAG fusion protein, the mAb M2-reactive 38-kDa band corresponding to the co-precipitated GIPC-FLAG fusion protein could be detected (lane1). This interaction was specific as shown by the failure of co-precipitation of control-FLAG with gp75 (lane 3). The coexpression of GIPC with gp75ΔC14 did not result in its co-precipitation with gp75 (lane 2). Immunoblotting of total cell lysates showed approximately equal expression of GIPC-FLAG fusion protein (Fig. 2,middle panel) and full-length and truncated gp75 (bottom panel) in the transfectants. These data demonstrate that the PDZ domain protein GIPC binds efficiently to the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of gp75 in melanocytic cells. This is consistent with the canonical mode of PDZ domain interaction with the carboxyl-terminal amino acids of target membrane proteins (32Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). gp75 is a member of the tyrosinase family of melanosomal membrane proteins, and its cytoplasmic tail, which contains the conserved dileucine sorting motif, shares limited sequence homology with other members of the tyrosinase family (14Vijayasaradhi S.

One concern is that RT molecules bound at the 3′ end of RNA would not be easily detected because RT may not catalyze substantial RNA extension or cleavage when bound to the 3′ end. We used physical mapping to show that RT binds preferentially to the 5′ end of RNA primers. An HIV-RT that lacked RNase H activity (HIV-RTE478Q) was incubated with the RNA-DNA hybrid followed by the addition of Escherichia coli RNase H. RT protected a ∼23-base region at the 5′ end of the RNA and 4 additional bases on the DNA strand. This footprint correlated well with the crystal structure of HIV-RT. No protection of the RNA 3′ end was observed, although when dNTPs were included, low levels of extension occurred, indicating that RT can bind this end. Wild-type HIV-RT cleaved the RNA and then extended a small portion of the cleaved fragments, suggesting that very small RNAs may be bound similar to DNA primers.

This enzyme possesses both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activities (2Hansen J. Schulze T. Moelling K. J. Biol.

The latter activity can cleave the RNA portion of an RNA-DNA hybrid. An RT-associated double-stranded RNA-dependent RNase activity, termed RNase H*, has also been reported (5Ben-Artzi H. Zeelon E. Gorecki M. Panet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).To initiate synthesis of the first strand of DNA (minus strand), which uses the RNA genome as template, HIV-RT binds to the 3′ end of a host tRNALys molecule that associates with the viral primer-binding site. The primer-binding site region is located near the 5′ end of the viral genome and consists of 18 nucleotides that are complementary to the 18 3′ bases of the tRNA. The tRNA acts as a primer for DNA synthesis by RT. A second RNA primer termed the poly purine tract is used to initiate synthesis of the second DNA strand (plus strand), which uses the first strand as a template (1Goff S.P. Telesnitsky A. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). In addition to using RNA primers to initiate synthesis, the low processivity (average number of nucleotides incorporated in a single binding event between enzyme and primer-template) of HIV-RT implies that the growing DNA strand must be reinitiated several times to complete synthesis of the provirus (6DeStefano J.J.

Crystal structures also show 3′-recessed termini of double-stranded DNA substrates bound at the presumed polymerase active site, suggesting that the RNase H site is associated with the substrate ∼18 bases upstream (13Arnold E.

In addition, results have shown that some RT-mediated cleavages, which were termed “polymerase-dependent cleavages,” could be advanced upon primer extension and remained a fixed distance from the extended 3′-primer terminus (10Furfine E.S.

Taken together, this work suggests that the positioning of the RNase H active site on the RNA-DNA hybrid is coordinated by the binding of the polymerase active site to the 3′-terminal nucleotide of a recessed DNA primer.In the enzymatic assays cited above, the substrates were relatively short segments of DNA hybridized to longer segments of RNA such that the 3′ terminus of the DNA was recessed on the RNA strand. This is the general arrangement that exists during first-strand DNA synthesis. Clearly, under such conditions RT associates with the 3′ DNA terminus in a configuration that allows DNA extension from the 3′ DNA terminus. In contrast, several reports have indicated that HIV-RT associates preferentially with the 5′ end of an oligonucleotide RNA that is bound to a relatively long DNA template in a primer configuration (15DeStefano J.J.

The orientation of RT on RNA primers seems contradictory because two RNA primers (tRNA and the polypurine tract) must be used during provirus replication. Results with RNA primers are based on experiments that assessed the position of the enzyme by RNase H cleavage. Initial cleavages of the RNA primers were observed ∼18–20 bases from the 5′ end of the RNA and were independent of the 3′ end. Cleavages or nucleotide additions consistent with RT binding at the 3′ end were not observed. Because the conclusions were based on enzymatic activity, it remains possible that binding to the 3′ end was not observed, because the enzyme cannot carry out efficient catalysis (either RNA cleavage or primer extension) when bound at this location. Consistent with this possibility is the low efficiency of the natural RNA primer for second-strand DNA synthesis (the poly purine tract) when compared with a DNA primer of the same sequence (20Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the enzymatic results clearly indicate that the RT can bind to the 5′ end of an RNA primer, these other considerations leave in doubt if this is the preferred binding orientation. It is possible that RT prefers to bind to the RNA primer at the 3′ end in an orientation favoring extension but can switch to a less favored position at the 5′ end. The lack of a catalytic event at the 3′ end would mean that the preferred binding position would go undetected.One method that could be used to determine where RT binds to RNA primers would be to physically map the location of the enzyme using a protections type assay. However, Escherichia coli RNase H or other enzymes that could be used for the mapping would require divalent cation to cleave the regions of the hybrid not protected by RT. The RNase H activity of RT precludes the use of divalent cation, because this would activate the RNase H activity of RT, leading to cleavage of the protected region. To overcome this problem an RT enzyme that lacks RNase H activity would be required. Although many such mutants have been characterized, most are also defective for DNA polymerization, suggesting that they may not interact with primer-template-like wild-type enzyme. However, a particular mutation in a putative catalytic residue of RNase H, an aspartate-to-asparagine at position 478 (HIV-RTGlu → Gln), seems to have no effect on polymerization (21Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Gruninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F.J. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This mutant has polymerization activity that is essentially identical to the wild-type enzyme, indicating that it binds primer-template correctly. HIV-RTGlu → Gln has been used extensively by others for experiments requiring DNA polymerase activity in the absence of RNase H (22Cowan J.A. Ohyama T. Howard K. Rausch J.W. Cowan S.M. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2000; 5: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 23Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C.

Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Using HIV-RTGlu → Glnwe were able to physically map RT molecules to the 5′ end of RNA primers while molecules were not detected at the 3′ end. The results are consistent with HIV-RT binding preferentially to the 5′ end of RNA primers. The polypurine tract and tRNALys likely represent structurally unique RNA primers that coordinate binding in a different orientation.DISCUSSIONWe have used physical mapping techniques to determine the location of HIV-RT on RNA molecules recessed on a longer DNA (RNA primer configuration). Previous enzymatic analyses had indicated that RT binds near the 5′ end of the RNA on these substrates and generally recognizes the RNA as a substrate for RNase H cleavage rather than extension (15DeStefano J.J.

A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The previous results are subject to other interpretations as noted in the Introduction, namely that RNA molecules bound at the 3′ end of the RNA may not manifest an activity (either cleavage or polymerization) that could be detected easily. In this report we show that physical mapping techniques are consistent with the enzymatic results and that RT binds with high stability to the 5′ end of the RNA primer. This mode of binding was independent of the position of the 3′ end of the RNA and was also sequence-independent, at least with respect to the sequences tested. Results also indicated that RT can bind to and extend from the 3′ end of the RNA (see Figs. 4 and 5), although this likely represents a low affinity binding mode because protection of the 3′ end was not observed and the extension efficiency was very low.Although it is not entirely clear what causes RT to associate with the 5′ end of the RNA primer, it seems that the 5′ RNA terminus plays some role. Others have shown that cleavages within an RNA-DNA hybrid region can be directed by the association of RT with the 5′ end of the RNA, even if that end is not part of the hybrid region (17Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The limitations on this direction seem to be that the 5′-RNA terminus must be within ∼18 bases (the length between the polymerase and RNase H active sites of RT) of the hybrid region, although no substrates with 10–27-base overhangs were tested. Consistent with these findings, RNA fragments that corresponded to RT associating with the 5′ end of a 9-base overhang region of RNA were observed in protection assays (Fig. 6). However, fragments corresponding to RT binding at the 3′-recessed DNA terminus on this substrate were also observed. The proportion of the different protected RNAs was approximately equal, suggesting that RT can bind at both positions with about equal affinity. Alternatively RT may preferably bind in one orientation and then occasionally switch to the second. Consistent with this hypothesis, the group of longer fragments corresponding to RT binding to the 3′-recessed DNA terminus decreased over time, whereas the level of shorter products corresponding to 5′ RNA end-binding increased. The observed decrease could have resulted from RT molecules dissociating from the substrate and allowing access by E. coli RNase H as was observed with other substrates. It is also possible that some of the decrease was caused by these longer RNAs being further cleaved when RT moved to the 5′ end of the RNA. This could explain the increase in shorter products over time. Further experimentation would be required to definitively determine how RT binds to these types of substrates.It was not possible to determine the exact length of the substrate that was protected by RT. Because cleavage data shows that RT cleaved about 18 bases 3′ of the 5′ end of the RNA (15DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A.

Bambara R.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), presumably the polymerase domain would be bound at the 5′ end, and the RNase H site would be positioned 18 bases “behind” the polymerase. Using this logic the results suggested that HIV-RT protects about 23 bases behind the polymerase active site on the primer strand and 4 bases in front of this site on the DNA template strand. Steric effects were invoked in determining protection in front of the polymerase site, because results without RT indicated that Exo I could only get within 5 bases of the RNA-DNA hybrid region. No steric inferences were used in estimating the 23-base protected region, although it is not known if cleavage byE. coli RNase H was limited as this enzyme abutted against RT. It is also not known if RT is completely stationary on RNA primer substrates or if the enzyme can slide to some extent. Sliding might allow bases that are normally protected to become transiently susceptible to cleavage. Note also that the 23-base length represents the shortest protected fragments observed, although some protection was observed as much as 3–4 bases beyond this length. Given these considerations an exact length of protected bases would be difficult to state using this approach. However, similar experiments used to map DNA primers hybridized to a DNA template suggested that a 23-base region behind the 3′-recessed primer terminus was protected on the template strand (25Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The current proposed model for the binding of RT to an RNA primer suggests that the RNA primer strand is synonymous with the DNA template strand of a DNA-DNA primer-template (15DeStefano J.J. Mallaber L.M. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4330-4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16DeStefano J.J.

A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore the previous experiments are essentially in agreement with those shown here. The authors of the latter work also found that a 7-base region in front of the 3′-DNA terminus was protected on the template strand. The 4-base region suggested here for an RNA primer is not inconsistent with this, because in current experiments these 4 bases would correspond to the primer strand in the latter work. It should also be noted that the 23-base distance is in good accord with the proposed crystal structure of HIV-RT (25Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).The presented work confirms the findings of enzymatic analysis in showing that RT binds preferentially to the 5′ end of RNA bound internally on a longer DNA template. The orientation of binding clearly positions RT to cleave the RNA rather than use it as a primer. In this regard, RNA fragments left associated with the DNA strand during minus-strand DNA synthesis would likely be cleaved away rather than be used to prime plus-strand DNA synthesis. This mode of binding may have evolved to prevent spurious priming of second-strand DNA synthesis limiting priming of the plus strand to the specialized polypurine tract RNA primer. However, there was evidence suggesting that after cleavage of the relatively long RNA primers used in this work, a small proportion of the short cleavage products can be used to prime DNA synthesis (see Figs. 4 and 5 with wild-type RT). The RNA portion of products thus produced (corresponding to about 9 nucleotides (see “Results”)) is apparently resistant to RT RNase H activity. Priming of HIV synthesis by RNAs other than the polypurine tract has also been shown in vivo and in an in vitro system designed to mimic plus-strand DNA synthesis (28Klarmann G.J., Yu, H. Chen X. Dougherty J.P. Preston B.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9259-9269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown that after the initial cleavage of an RNA primer 18 bases in from the 5′ end, a secondary cleavage is made about 9 bases from the 5′ end, resulting in two separate 9-base products (18Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37664-37671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). From the results shown here it is likely that some small proportion of the 5′-derived 9-base products can be extended by RT. The likelihood of extension may depend on the sequence of the product. In our experiments the moderately G-C-rich nature of the 9 5′-end bases (5′-GGGCGAAUU-3′) may have allowed these fragments to remain bound to the DNA long enough to be extended. It should also be noted that these experiments were performed in the absence of the viral nucleocapsid protein (NC), which has been shown to destabilize short hybrids (29DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16350-16356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ji X. Klarmann G.J. Preston B.D.

Further analysis of the conditions required for extension of random RNAs by HIV-RT will be required to determine whether extension of some nonspecific RNAs is likely to occur in the cell. The conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome of retroviruses to a double-stranded DNA (provirus) requires several steps that are carried out by the multifunctional viral reverse transcriptase (RT)1 (for a review see Ref.1Goff S.P. Telesnitsky A. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). This enzyme possesses both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNase H activities (2Hansen J. Schulze T. Moelling K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R. Oroszlan S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G.

The latter activity can cleave the RNA portion of an RNA-DNA hybrid. An RT-associated double-stranded RNA-dependent RNase activity, termed RNase H*, has also been reported (5Ben-Artzi H. Zeelon E. Gorecki M. Panet A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To initiate synthesis of the first strand of DNA (minus strand), which uses the RNA genome as template, HIV-RT binds to the 3′ end of a host tRNALys molecule that associates with the viral primer-binding site. The primer-binding site region is located near the 5′ end of the viral genome and consists of 18 nucleotides that are complementary to the 18 3′ bases of the tRNA. The tRNA acts as a primer for DNA synthesis by RT. A second RNA primer termed the poly purine tract is used to initiate synthesis of the second DNA strand (plus strand), which uses the first strand as a template (1Goff S.P. Telesnitsky A. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar). In addition to using RNA primers to initiate synthesis, the low processivity (average number of nucleotides incorporated in a single binding event between enzyme and primer-template) of HIV-RT implies that the growing DNA strand must be reinitiated several times to complete synthesis of the provirus (6DeStefano J.J.

Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar, 2Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 133-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). During this process, IN must recognize specific sequences at the ends of viral DNA as well as host target sequences (3Katzman M. Katz R.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recognition of viral ends is dependent on specific DNA sequences, whereas many host DNA sequences can serve as targets. In vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that the integration reaction proceeds through defined steps. First, IN nicks the viral DNA ends at specific sites adjacent to highly conserved CA dinucleotide, usually located two base pairs from each DNA terminus (4Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Roth M.J. Schwartzberg P.L. Goff S.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 47-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Such “processing,” produces new recessed 3′-OH ends and releases a dinucleotide. In the second step, “joining,” IN catalyzes the insertion of the newly formed 3′-OH ends into target DNA (6Craigie R. Fujiwara T. Bushman F. Cell. 1990; 62: 829-837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 7Katz R.A. Merkel G. Kulkosky J. Leis J. Skalka A.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The joining occurs through a coupled cleavage-ligation reaction whereby the 3′-OH oxygens of the viral DNA attack phosphorous atoms in both strands of the target DNA backbone, staggered by four to six base pairs (8Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The product is a gapped intermediate in which only the 3′-ends of viral DNA are joined to target DNA. The gaps are repaired and the 5′-ends of viral DNA are joined to host DNA by undetermined mechanisms that depend on host repair functions (9Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In vitro, IN alone is sufficient to catalyze the processing and joining reactions. Only a metal cofactor (Mg2+ or Mn2+) and appropriate viral and target DNA substrates are required. The simplest in vitro systems employ model DNA substrates representing the terminal 15–20 base pairs of a single viral DNA end (3Katzman M. Katz R.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The efficiency of processing is strongly dependent on the highly conserved CA dinucleotide sequence, whereas other less critical sequences reside within the first approximately seven base pairs (3Katzman M. Katz R.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The retroviral INs are three-domain proteins of ∼300 amino acids (10Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19633-19636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,11Esposito D. Craigie R. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 319-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal region is a zinc-binding domain of ∼50 amino acids that may function in multimerization and/or DNA recognition. The central catalytic domain is ∼150 amino acids and contains a highly conserved constellation of acidic residues (the D,D(35)E motif) comprising the active site. The fold of this domain identifies IN as a member of a structural superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases (12Yang W. Steitz T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar,13Wlodawer A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 335-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxylate residues of the D,D(35)E motif are essential for IN activity, and structural analyses of the avian sarcoma virus (ASV) and human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) IN catalytic domains have confirmed their predicted role in binding the required metal ion(s), Mg2+ or Mn2+ (13Wlodawer A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 335-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis experiments indicate that the D,D(35)E motif comprises a single active site for both the processing and joining reactions (14Kulkosky J. Jones K.S. Katz R.A. Mack J.P. Skalka A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 15Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, functional analyses indicate that the catalytic domain recognizes critical features of the viral DNA substrate and plays a role in target-site recognition as well (3Katzman M. Katz R.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is ∼100 amino acids and encodes a nonspecific DNA binding activity (16Khan E. Mack J.P. Katz R.A. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 851-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Vink C. Oude Groeneger A.M. Plasterk R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Woerner A.M. Marcus-Sekura C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3507-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); however, the precise role of this activity in recognition of viral and target DNA is not well understood. In addition to viral-specific sequence requirements, structural features of the viral DNA termini affect processing. If HIV-1 IN model viral DNA substrates are extended beyond the normal termini with duplex DNA, the efficiency of correct processing at the CA dinucleotide is reduced or eliminated (19Vink C. van Gent D.C. Elgersma Y. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Studies by Scottoline et al. (20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) suggest a model in which the proximity of the processing site to the DNA terminus allows disruption of base pairing, and this is a critical step in the processing reaction. In addition, identification of cyclic dinucleotide products of the processing reaction indicates that the viral 3′-OH (as well as water) can act as a nucleophile for the processing reaction (8Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Formation of this cyclic nucleotide suggest that DNA melting and distortion of the DNA substrate occurs, such that the 3′-OH is positioned to attack the phosphate at position −2 on the same strand. DNA distortion of the target DNA can also enhance the joining reaction (21Müller H.P. Varmus H.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4704-4714Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that the distorted viral DNA terminus and distorted target DNA could be recognized in a similar manner (20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated the interaction between ASV IN and model viral DNA termini using a thymidine-selective chemical probe, potassium permanganate (KMnO4), to detect protein-induced DNA distortions such as base unpairing and/or unstacking (22Holstege F.C. Timmers H.T. Methods. 1997; 12: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen P.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The results show that accessibility of three terminal base pairs to KMnO4 is significantly increased in the presence of ASV IN, and this DNA-distorting activity maps to the catalytic domain. A positive correlation between the extent of IN-mediated distortion and processing activities was also observed. Assays were carried out under conditions similar to those described previously (24Kukolj G. DuBow M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17827-17835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions mixtures contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA. To 16 μl of buffer, ∼1 pmol (1 μl) of32P-labeled DNA substrate (∼2–4 × 106dpm) and 1 μl of IN, IN dilution, or buffer blank were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 1 μl of 50 mmKMnO4 was added, and incubation was continued at 37 °C for 4 min. Volume was adjusted with 78 μl binding buffer and 25 μl of stop solution (1.5 m NaOAc, pH 5.2, 1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml tRNA) was added. The nucleic acids were ethanol-precipitated, and the pellets were washed in ethanol, dried, and subjected to piperidine cleavage by resuspension in 1 m piperidine and heating at 92 °C for 30 min. The samples were lyophilized, resuspended in 10 μl of water, and lyophilized again. After a second lyophilization from 10 μl of water, the samples were resuspended in Maxam and Gilbert gel loading buffer and fractionated on 20% acrylamide-Urea gels. Bands were quantitated using a Fuji phosphorimager. Processing assays were carried out using conditions similar to those previously described (4Katzman M. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5319-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions (10 μl) typically contained 1 × 106 dpm32P-labeled viral DNA substrate, 15 μmunlabeled viral DNA substrate, 2 μm IN, and 10 mm MnCl2 (or 3 mmMgCl2), 50 mm Hepes (pH 8.2), 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% thiodiglycol, 10 μm EDTA and 4% glycerol. The latter four components are contributed from the IN storage buffer. Samples were removed at the indicated times and subjected to fractionation on 20% polyacrylamide-Urea gels. Processing activity was quantitated using a Fuji phosphorimager. Wild type (WT) ASV IN and individual domains were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (25Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 500 mmNaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Mutations encoding the Arg-161 and Lys-164 substitutions were introduced into the sequence of a His-tagged ASV IN catalytic domain (52) using standard polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. 4th Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments were cloned in the expression plasmid, pET28b (Novagen). The bacterially expressed His-tagged proteins were purified by standard methods (27Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A WT His-tagged version was purified in parallel. Proteins were dialyzed against a buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.1, 1% thiodiglycol, 1 mm EDTA, and 40% glycerol. Filter binding assays were carried out as described previously (28Müller B. Bizub-Bender D. Andrake M.D. Jones K.S. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Binding buffer contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions contained 1.5 μm unlabeled WT+ substrate and 1 × 106 dpm WT+ substrate (see Fig. 1). IN catalytic domain fragments were added at 0.5, 1.0, 2,0, 4.0, 8.0 and 16.0 μm. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and processed as described previously (28Müller B. Bizub-Bender D. Andrake M.D. Jones K.S. Skalka A.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5631-5639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that IN recognizes specific viral sequences efficiently only when they are present at DNA termini (19Vink C. van Gent D.C. Elgersma Y. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate potential DNA structure-specific interactions between IN and viral DNA substrates we used model ASV DNA substrates comprising a 19-mer duplex that corresponds to the U3 end of ASV DNA. The experimental design is summarized in Fig.1. The strand that is normally cleaved in the processing reaction to release the two Ts was 5′-end-labeled with32P. KMnO4, a reagent frequently used to detect regions of DNA that are unpaired or distorted as a result of protein binding (22Holstege F.C. Timmers H.T. Methods. 1997; 12: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen P.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), was added to the reactions to detect potential IN-mediated distortion of viral DNA. KMnO4 is an oxidizing agent that attacks the 5,6 double bonds of thymine. In B-DNA, this bond is shielded by base stacking interaction and, thus, T residues in such DNA duplexes are relatively resistant to oxidation. The KMnO4 modification reaction can be affected by a variety of buffer conditions; for example, glycerol and reducing agents can quench the reaction (22Holstege F.C. Timmers H.T. Methods. 1997; 12: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To control for such variation, buffer blanks (0 μm IN) were included in all experiments. In addition, all proteins were dialyzed against the same batch of buffer, which was also used as a blank. The sensitivity of the reaction can be adjusted by varying KMnO4 concentration, reaction times, and conditions that affect DNA breathing (i.e. NaCl concentration). IN requires a divalent metal for activity (Mg2+ or Mn2+) and, thus, divalent metal was excluded from these reactions to prevent IN-mediated cleavage of substrate DNA. After the mixtures of DNA substrates and ASV IN were exposed to KMnO4, they were treated with piperidine and fractioned on polyacrylamide-urea gels. As shown in Fig.2 A (lane 3), in the absence of IN, the two terminal Ts (positions 1 and 2) are partially accessible to KMnO4 modification, as might be expected due to breathing at the DNA ends (29Leroy J.L. Kochoyan M. Huynh-Dinh T. Guéron M. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 223-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of increasing concentrations of IN, these two thymidines become significantly more accessible (lanes 4–6). The IN concentration at which distortion is detected is within the range used in the standard IN processing assay. As expected, cleavage requires treatment with both KMnO4 and piperidine, demonstrating that the cleavage is chemically mediated rather than IN endonuclease-mediated. At the concentration of KMnO4 used in these experiments, the basal level for IN-independent modification was low (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Under these conditions, some substrate remained unreacted in the presence of IN (Fig. 2 A, lane 6), allowing quantitation of the IN-dependent affects by phosphorimaging (data not shown). Sensitivity of the thymidine at position 3 from the tip on the complementary strand was also examined. As shown in Fig. 2 B, ASV IN-mediated distortion could also be detected at this position. In this case, very little background breathing was observed. A basic protein, equine cytochrome c (pI = 9.58) was also included as control for ASV IN (pI = 9.94); no significant activity was detected with the control protein, even at a 3-fold higher concentration (Fig. 2 C). To examine the DNA sequence requirements for this distortion activity, several mutant substrates were assayed (Fig.3 A; mutant substrates are shown in Fig. 1). The highly conserved CA at positions 3 and 4 from the terminus (and corresponding complementary base pairs) was changed to GA (lanes 6–10) or GT (lanes 11–15). As expected from previous studies (3Katzman M. Katz R.A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a significant reduction (∼10-fold) in processing activity (−2 cleavage) was observed with these substrates using Mg2+ as a cofactor (Fig. 3 A). However the IN-mediated DNA distortion activity was similar to wild type with both mutant substrates (Fig. 3 B). With the CA to GT change, the thymidine introduced at position 3 from the end became accessible to KMnO4 in the presence of IN (lane 12). This is consistent with the reactivity of the thymidine at the third position in the complementary strand of the wild type substrate (Fig.2 B). These results suggested that the distortion activity can be uncoupled from the processing activity. However, in the presence of Mn2+ as a cofactor, and with the incubation time extended to 60 min, −2 processing activity could be observed with the mutant substrates (Fig. 3 A, right panel). In general, the endonuclease activity of ASV IN increases with Mn2+while the specificity decreases. However, we note that the preferred IN-cleavage sites in the mutant substrates remain at the −2 position, suggesting that a feature other than the conserved CA dinucleotide can contribute to selection of the correct cleavage site. To investigate DNA sequence requirements for distortion activity further, we tested the activity of the ASV IN protein with heterologous, HIV-1 DNA substrates that differ in sequence from the ASV DNA substrate at most positions (substrates shown in Fig. 1). The U3- and U5-derived HIV-1 DNA substrates were mutated to introduce additional thymidine residues that could be monitored for KMnO4 modification (the G/C base pair at position 2 was changed to T/A). ASV IN was also able to distort the ends of these HIV-1 substrates as efficiently as the ASV substrates (Fig.3 C). Further analyses indicated that ASV IN could also cleave the HIV-1 substrates with Mn2+ as a cofactor with the preferred site being −2 (data not shown). Thus, on all substrates tested, we observed a relationship between the ability of ASV IN to distort ends and select the correct processing site. The results described above suggested that although the sequence requirement for DNA end distortion by ASV IN is quite relaxed; such distortion may be important for processing activity. As KMnO4 is believed to detect base unpairing or unstacking, it seemed possible that such distortion may be required for processing as proposed previously for HIV-1 IN (20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If so, base mismatching at the termini should stimulate processing by ASV IN. To test this prediction, a set of substrates was designed in which the terminal two base pairs were mismatched. In these test substrates, the two terminal Ts (on the strand with the processing site) were maintained, and non-complementary bases (CC, GG, TT) were introduced on the opposite strand. In this way the KMnO4 sensitivity of the two terminal Ts could be monitored as with the WT substrate. We first monitored KMnO4 sensitivity of the mismatched substrates (Fig. 4 A). The percentage of cleaved products corresponding to the terminal two Ts was quantified by phosphorimaging (data not shown). To establish the range of KMnO4 sensitivity for the terminal Ts, we compared the WT+ substrate to one that contained unpaired Ts at positions 1 and 2 (ΔAA, Fig. 1). Surprisingly, in the absence of ASV IN, the KMnO4 reactivity of the terminal Ts in this substrate differed by only ∼2-fold from the substrate containing paired terminal nucleotides (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1and 5). We interpret these results to mean either that there is significant breathing in the WT substrate under these conditions or that the unpaired bases in the ΔAA substrate maintain stacking interaction and thus are relatively resistant to KMnO4modification. As observed previously, addition of increasing amounts of IN resulted in increased KMnO4 sensitivity with the WT substrate (lanes 1–4). Furthermore, addition of IN also increased the sensitivity of the terminal Ts in the substrate with unpaired Ts (lanes 5–8). This suggests that IN is able to distort the DNA terminus in a manner that is distinct from, but may include, base unpairing. As expected, an increase in KMnO4sensitivity of the terminal Ts (∼3-fold) was observed in all the mismatched substrates (lanes 9–20) compared with the WT substrate (lanes 1–4). We next tested the ability of ASV IN to process the mismatched substrates. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the rate and extent of processing of all three mismatched substrates was significantly higher than the WT substrate. One interpretation of this positive correlation between end distortion and enzymatic activity is that mismatching at the termini lowers an energetic barrier for processing (20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If unpairing of ASV termini is required for efficient processing, then stabilization of base pairing at the substrate tips might be expected to inhibit this activity. As a corollary to the experiments with mismatched substrates, we examined substrates in which the terminus was stabilized by replacing the two T/A base pairs with more stable G/C base pairs (see Fig. 1 for substrates). Replacement of the two terminal T residues with G residues removes the KMnO4-sensitive T bases, and therefore position 3 was monitored for KMnO4 modification on the opposite strand (as in Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig.5 A (lanes 1 and2) the T at position 3 in the WT substrate shows increased susceptibility to KMnO4 modification in the presence of IN as in Fig. 2 B. Modification of position 3 in the substrate with the GG/CC ends (lane 3) is significantly lower than the WT, presumably due to reduced breathing of these ends. KMnO4 accessibility in the presence of IN was also significantly reduced as compared with the WT substrate (comparelanes 2 and 4). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the rate and extent of processing of the GG/CC stabilized substrate (lanes 6–10), was also reduced as compared with the WT substrate (lanes 1–5, and graph). To distinguish between sequence and structural effects of the GG/CC mutation, we introduced a change at position 3 in which the highly conserved A was substituted with a T creating a T/T mismatch. This mismatch is predicted to destabilize the terminus structure and promote CA-independent processing as described previously for HIV-1 DNA substrates (20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 B (lanes 11–15, and graph), this mismatch indeed restored near WT processing activity. KMnO4sensitivity was also significantly enhanced at the mismatch site in the presence of IN (Fig. 5 A, compare lanes 4 and6). These results also show that the extent of IN distortion at the terminus and the efficiency of processing are correlated. In addition, mismatching at position 3 can overcome the deleterious effect of mutating the conserved CA dinucleotide. Previous studies have shown that extending the DNA terminus severely inhibited processing by HIV-1 IN (19Vink C. van Gent D.C. Elgersma Y. Plasterk R.H.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4636-4644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Scottoline B.P. Chow S. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation is that the terminal extension prevents unpairing or distortion at the processing site. To test this hypothesis, the ASV U3 terminus was extended by two additional base pairs (TT/AA). KMnO4 analysis revealed significant DNA breathing of the terminal two base pairs in the absence of IN (Fig.6 A, lane 1). In the presence of IN, sensitivity of the two terminal Ts was enhanced and extended to the T adjacent to the processing site (lane 2). A control substrate in which the four T stretch was entirely unpaired showed equal sensitivity of all unpaired Ts in the absence of IN (lane 3), but greatly enhanced KMnO4 sensitivity was observed at the T adjacent to the CA in the presence of IN (lane 4). Correct IN processing (−4 position) of the extended substrate was reduced as compared with the control substrate containing the unpaired T extension (Fig. 6 B, comparelanes 1–5 with lanes 6–10). However, initial cleavage (lanes 2 and 3) occurred at an aberrant site in the extended substrate, which was two base pairs from the terminus (−2), followed by cleavage at the correct site (−4) at later times (lanes 4 and 5). As noted above, KMnO4modification of the extended duplex substrate is most efficient at the two terminal positions in the presence of IN (Fig. 6 A,lane 2). Under these conditions, it is possible that initial cleavage is dictated by IN-mediated distortion at positions 1 and 2. The initial cleavage may expose a new 3′-end, possibly allowing further distortion at the correct −4 site. This experiment provides further evidence that an important feature for processing site selection is the distance from the terminus and that processing depends on the ability of the DNA ends to become distorted or unpaired. We next asked which domain or domains of ASV IN were responsible for the DNA distortion activity. Four truncated proteins were assayed: IN 1–207, 39–286, 52–207, and 208–286 (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig. 7 B, distortion activity could be detected with the two proteins that retained the catalytic domain (1–207 and 39–286). The isolated catalytic domain (52) did not display distortion activity when assayed at the same concentrations, but activity could be detected at higher concentrations (Fig. 7 C). The C-terminal domain, 208–286, assayed as a GST fusion protein (30Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29299-29306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), did not display detectable activity even at a higher concentration (7B,lane 18). We conclude that the catalytic domain contains the distorting activity, but both the N- and C-terminal domains can contribute to the activity either by stabilizing the catalytic domain or by participating in DNA binding. The isolated catalytic domain of ASV IN (52) lacks detectable processing and joining activities but retains the −3 DNA nicking (see Fig. 3 A, right) as well as “disintegration” activities (25Kulkosky J. Katz R.A. Merkel G. Skalka A.M. Virology. 1995; 206: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 31Bujacz G. Jaskólski M. Alexandratos J. Wlodawer A. Merkel G. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) of the full-length IN. The nicking activity shows specificity for cleavage between the conserved C and the A, but the biological relevance of this reaction is unknown.

https://openalex.org/W2143100884,"Hjc is an archaeal DNA endonuclease, which resolves the Holliday junction in the presence of divalent metals. Combined with mutational analyses, the x-ray structure of thePyrococcus furiosus Hjc crystal grown in the presence of ammonium sulfate revealed a positively charged interface, rich in conserved basic residues, and the catalytic center (Nishino, T., Komori, K., Tsuchiya, D., Ishino, Y., and Morikawa, K. (2001)Structure 9, 197–T204). This structural study also suggested that the N-terminal segment and some loops of Hjc play crucial roles in the cleavage of DNA. However, a structural view of the interaction between these regions and DNA remains elusive. To clarify the regional roles of Hjc in the recognition of the Holliday junction, further structural and biochemical analyses were carried out. A new crystal form of Hjc was obtained from a polyethylene glycol solution in the absence of ammonium sulfate, and its structure has been determined at 2.16-Å resolution. A comparison of the two crystal structures has revealed that the N-terminal segment undergoes a serious conformational change. The site-directed mutagenesis of the sulfate-binding site within the segment caused a dramatic decrease in the junction binding, but the mutant was still capable of cleaving DNA with a 20-fold lower efficiency. The kinetic analysis of Hjc-Holliday junction interaction indicated that mutations in the N-terminal segment greatly increased the dissociation rate constants of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex, explaining the decreased stability of the complex. This segment is also responsible for the disruption of base pairs near the junction center, through specific interactions with them. Taken together, these results imply that, in addition to the secondary effects of two basic loops, the flexible N-terminal segment plays predominant roles in the recognition of DNA conformation near the crossover and in correct positioning of the cleavage site to the catalytic center of the Hjc resolvase. Hjc is an archaeal DNA endonuclease, which resolves the Holliday junction in the presence of divalent metals. Combined with mutational analyses, the x-ray structure of thePyrococcus furiosus Hjc crystal grown in the presence of ammonium sulfate revealed a positively charged interface, rich in conserved basic residues, and the catalytic center (Nishino, T., Komori, K., Tsuchiya, D., Ishino, Y., and Morikawa, K. (2001)Structure 9, 197–T204). This structural study also suggested that the N-terminal segment and some loops of Hjc play crucial roles in the cleavage of DNA. However, a structural view of the interaction between these regions and DNA remains elusive. To clarify the regional roles of Hjc in the recognition of the Holliday junction, further structural and biochemical analyses were carried out. A new crystal form of Hjc was obtained from a polyethylene glycol solution in the absence of ammonium sulfate, and its structure has been determined at 2.16-Å resolution. A comparison of the two crystal structures has revealed that the N-terminal segment undergoes a serious conformational change. The site-directed mutagenesis of the sulfate-binding site within the segment caused a dramatic decrease in the junction binding, but the mutant was still capable of cleaving DNA with a 20-fold lower efficiency. The kinetic analysis of Hjc-Holliday junction interaction indicated that mutations in the N-terminal segment greatly increased the dissociation rate constants of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex, explaining the decreased stability of the complex. This segment is also responsible for the disruption of base pairs near the junction center, through specific interactions with them. Taken together, these results imply that, in addition to the secondary effects of two basic loops, the flexible N-terminal segment plays predominant roles in the recognition of DNA conformation near the crossover and in correct positioning of the cleavage site to the catalytic center of the Hjc resolvase. The Holliday junction is a universal DNA intermediate in homologous recombination, which plays crucial roles in the determination of genetic diversity and the repair of damaged chromosomes (1Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). This four-way junction DNA is formed during the exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. The recombination process is terminated by symmetrical resolution of the junction, mediated by Holliday structure-specific endonucleases, which are found ubiquitously from bacteriophages to yeasts (reviewed in Refs. 2White M.F.

These Holliday junction resolvases possess similar properties; they function as dimers and introduce symmetrical nicks into the Holliday junction in a divalent metal-dependent manner. They contain three or four invariant acidic residues that are important for the catalytic activity, in addition to several basic residues. Although these resolvases exhibit almost no sequence similarity, recent sequence and three-dimensional structural analyses have revealed that they can be classified into several distinct evolutionary families (7Aravind L.

T7 endonuclease I and Hjc belong to the nuclease family, whose folding motif is similar to that of the type II restriction endonucleases (11Hadden J.M. Convery M.A. Declais A.C. Lilley D.M.

T4 endonuclease VII contains a zinc-binding domain found in theMcrA-like restriction endonuclease (13Raaijimakers H. Vix O. Toro I. Golz S. Kemper B. Suck D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of RusA has been neither identified nor predicted. RuvC, CceI, and RusA exhibit a sequence preference upon cleavage, whereas T4 endonuclease VII, T7 endonuclease I, and Hjc appear to recognize junction structures (reviewed in Ref. 4Sharples G.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Holliday junction assumes different conformations in the presence and absence of metal ions. Comparative gel electrophoresis revealed that the Holliday junction by itself adopts two different conformations: open square and stacked-X (14Duckett D.R. Murchie A.I. Bhattacharyya A. Clegg R.M.

Although the crystal structures of the resolvase-Holliday junction complexes have not been determined yet, the structures of RuvC (23Ariyoshi M. Vassylyev D.G. Iwasaki H. Nakamura H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Cell. 1994; 78: 1063-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), T4 endonuclease VII (13Raaijimakers H. Vix O. Toro I. Golz S. Kemper B. Suck D.

Biol. 2001; 8: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and Hjc (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) suggest that these resolvases in common contain basic surfaces, which are most likely to contact the DNA. They all form homodimers related by 2-fold symmetry, which is suitable for introducing nicks into the two opposite strands of DNA, although their recognition schemes with the junction DNA seem to differ.Hjc is a Holliday junction resolvase that is highly conserved within archaea. We originally identified it from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus (24Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and extensively characterized it (25Komori K. Sakae S. Fujikane R. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4544-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Daiyasu H. Komori K. Sakae S. Ishino Y. Toh H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4540-4543Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of P. furiosus Hjc revealed a positively charged surface containing highly conserved amino acid residues (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its folding is similar to that of the type II restriction endonucleases, including the conformation of the canonical catalytic residues as described above. The docking examination between Hjc and the junction DNA suggested that the N-terminal segment and the two loops participate in DNA binding, in good agreement with the results from mutational analyses (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the actual roles of these regions in DNA recognition remain unclear.To obtain detailed insights into the specific interaction between Hjc and Holliday junction DNA, we have determined the structure of a different crystal form and performed site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate the unique and important roles of the flexible N-terminal segment in complex formation with the Holliday junction and its resolution.DISCUSSIONIn the previous report on the monoclinic Hjc structure, we proposed that the sulfate ion bound at the N-terminal region might reflect a phosphate moiety of the backbone of the junction DNA. The mutant Hjc lacking the N-terminal five amino acids showed a drastic decrease in the stability of the complex with the Holliday junction, and thus we concluded that this region is important for DNA recognition (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The present mutational analyses of the sulfate binding residues, Arg3 and Lys4, confirmed that these residues are indeed critical for the formation of a stable complex with the junction DNA but are not essential for the cleavage activity. Alterations of these residues (R3A/K4A) yielded a significant increase in the dissociation rate of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex. Furthermore, the R3A/K4A mutant was able to unstack the junction DNA and disrupt the base pairs when it bound the substrate. In contrast, the truncation mutant Δ5, which has the same k aand k d values as those of R3A/K4A for Holliday junction binding, can neither unstack the junction DNA nor cleave the DNA. These results imply that the N-terminal segment plays two major roles: stabilization of the complex and correct positioning of the DNA for cleavage.The different conformations of the N-terminal segment in the crystal structure, in the absence or presence of sulfate, suggested that it is more flexible than other parts of the Hjc protein. This conformational flexibility may be favorable for Hjc to find and to fit the DNA conformation that is suitable for cleavage. The multiple sequence alignment shows that Gly5 is absolutely conserved among the different Hjc sequences (Fig. 2 A). Since glycine is a key residue for the versatility of peptide conformations, this conformational flexibility may be an inherent property of Hjc.The two sets of contiguous lysines, Lys30/Lys31and Lys51/Lys52, which lie in two different loops, contribute to the interaction with the Holliday junction. Both of them appear to play similar roles in stabilizing the complex with the Holliday junction. However, they are considerably different in terms of the cleavage activity; the K51A/K52A mutant retains the cleavage activity with less efficiency than the wild-type Hjc, whereas the K30A/K31A mutant could not cleave Holliday junction (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that Lys30 and Lys31 in the loop play an additional role in arranging the DNA into an appropriate position for cleavage. Our previous analysis revealed that several conserved basic residues (Arg10, Arg25, and Lys81) are important for the cleavage activity but not for the DNA binding (27Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These residues are also located on the basic surface, and hence they may have a function similar to that shared by Lys30 and Lys31.The combined approach of mutational and structural analyses has allowed us to propose the following scheme for Holliday junction recognition and cleavage by Hjc. First, the junction DNA encounters the extensive basic surface of Hjc. Then the flexible N-terminal segment plays a major role in stabilizing the Hjc-Holliday junction complex together with the secondary contribution by the two sets of lysines, Lys30/Lys31 and Lys51/Lys52. Next, the DNA is arranged in the appropriate position relative to the catalytic residues of Hjc for incision. This step involves two modes of interactions between the protein and DNA. One is the disruption of the base pairs around the junction center, in which the N-terminal segment plays a major part. The other is the interaction of basic residues with DNA, involving the Lys30/Lys31 loop and several basic residues (Arg10, Arg25, and Lys81). After correct positioning, the phosphodiester bonds are cleaved in the nuclease center, composed of the canonical catalytic residues (Glu9, Asp33, Glu46, and Lys48) (27Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Base pair disruption is observed in a number of complexes of Holliday junction and the binding proteins; the crystal structure of the E. coli RuvA-Holliday junction complex revealed unpaired bases at the junction center (31Ariyoshi M. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8257-8262Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast CceI andE. coli RuvC also distort base pairs around the crossover point (15Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and in particular, the Phe69 side chain in RuvC appears to make a stacking interaction with the base pairs near the junction center (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10432-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). S. solfataricus Hjc also disrupts base pairs (20Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and as shown by the present study, the N-terminal segment appears to play a major role in this process. Previous modeling of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex has indicated that this segment is close to a phosphate backbone and might interact with the DNA minor groove (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the present crystal structure has highlighted the importance of the conformational flexibility of N-terminal segment, in both the induced fit mechanism and the correctly positioning of the segment close to the junction center. The disruption mechanism should be solved to prove our hypothesis, although it is possible that the base pair disruption is caused by simple tension resulting from the interaction between the peptide groups of the N-terminal segment and the DNA. The primary sequence of the N-terminal segment contains an aromatic residue, but it is not well conserved (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, since we have expressed recombinant Hjc in E. coli, there may be some modification within this region in the native form. However, our biochemical analyses suggested that both the Holliday junction binding and cleavage activity are similar between the native and the recombinant Hjcs (24Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we presume that drastic modification would not be taking place in theP. furiosus cells.During our manuscript preparation, the crystal structure of Hjc fromS. solfataricus was reported (32Bond C.S. Kvaratskhelia M. Richard D. White M.F. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5509-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The structure was similar to that of P. furiosus Hjc with a root mean square displacement value of 2.4 Å for residues 6–114. Interestingly, inS. solfataricus Hjc, two regions, the N-terminal segment and Lys30/Lys31 loop, were structurally disordered. The flexibility of the N-terminal segment agrees well with our data forP. furiosus Hjc. In addition, the flexibility of the Lys30/Lys31 loop is intriguing, because our mutational and biochemical analyses suggest its involvement in DNA recognition and cleavage.In conclusion, our structural and mutational analyses of Hjc have revealed the individual roles of various regions, which are important for the recognition and cleavage of Holliday junction. In particular, the flexible N-terminal segment greatly enhances the stability of the enzyme-junction DNA complex and contributes to the correct positioning of the cleavage site of the DNA to the catalytic site of Hjc. The present data have provided clearer insights into the tertiary structural view of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex. The elucidation of the precise recognition mechanism must await the Hjc-Holliday junction complex structure at atomic resolution. The Holliday junction is a universal DNA intermediate in homologous recombination, which plays crucial roles in the determination of genetic diversity and the repair of damaged chromosomes (1Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). This four-way junction DNA is formed during the exchange between two homologous DNA duplexes. The recombination process is terminated by symmetrical resolution of the junction, mediated by Holliday structure-specific endonucleases, which are found ubiquitously from bacteriophages to yeasts (reviewed in Refs. 2White M.F.

Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Its folding is similar to that of the type II restriction endonucleases, including the conformation of the canonical catalytic residues as described above. The docking examination between Hjc and the junction DNA suggested that the N-terminal segment and the two loops participate in DNA binding, in good agreement with the results from mutational analyses (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the actual roles of these regions in DNA recognition remain unclear. To obtain detailed insights into the specific interaction between Hjc and Holliday junction DNA, we have determined the structure of a different crystal form and performed site-directed mutagenesis. The results indicate the unique and important roles of the flexible N-terminal segment in complex formation with the Holliday junction and its resolution. DISCUSSIONIn the previous report on the monoclinic Hjc structure, we proposed that the sulfate ion bound at the N-terminal region might reflect a phosphate moiety of the backbone of the junction DNA. The mutant Hjc lacking the N-terminal five amino acids showed a drastic decrease in the stability of the complex with the Holliday junction, and thus we concluded that this region is important for DNA recognition (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The present mutational analyses of the sulfate binding residues, Arg3 and Lys4, confirmed that these residues are indeed critical for the formation of a stable complex with the junction DNA but are not essential for the cleavage activity. Alterations of these residues (R3A/K4A) yielded a significant increase in the dissociation rate of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex. Furthermore, the R3A/K4A mutant was able to unstack the junction DNA and disrupt the base pairs when it bound the substrate. In contrast, the truncation mutant Δ5, which has the same k aand k d values as those of R3A/K4A for Holliday junction binding, can neither unstack the junction DNA nor cleave the DNA. These results imply that the N-terminal segment plays two major roles: stabilization of the complex and correct positioning of the DNA for cleavage.The different conformations of the N-terminal segment in the crystal structure, in the absence or presence of sulfate, suggested that it is more flexible than other parts of the Hjc protein. This conformational flexibility may be favorable for Hjc to find and to fit the DNA conformation that is suitable for cleavage. The multiple sequence alignment shows that Gly5 is absolutely conserved among the different Hjc sequences (Fig. 2 A). Since glycine is a key residue for the versatility of peptide conformations, this conformational flexibility may be an inherent property of Hjc.The two sets of contiguous lysines, Lys30/Lys31and Lys51/Lys52, which lie in two different loops, contribute to the interaction with the Holliday junction. Both of them appear to play similar roles in stabilizing the complex with the Holliday junction. However, they are considerably different in terms of the cleavage activity; the K51A/K52A mutant retains the cleavage activity with less efficiency than the wild-type Hjc, whereas the K30A/K31A mutant could not cleave Holliday junction (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that Lys30 and Lys31 in the loop play an additional role in arranging the DNA into an appropriate position for cleavage. Our previous analysis revealed that several conserved basic residues (Arg10, Arg25, and Lys81) are important for the cleavage activity but not for the DNA binding (27Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These residues are also located on the basic surface, and hence they may have a function similar to that shared by Lys30 and Lys31.The combined approach of mutational and structural analyses has allowed us to propose the following scheme for Holliday junction recognition and cleavage by Hjc. First, the junction DNA encounters the extensive basic surface of Hjc. Then the flexible N-terminal segment plays a major role in stabilizing the Hjc-Holliday junction complex together with the secondary contribution by the two sets of lysines, Lys30/Lys31 and Lys51/Lys52. Next, the DNA is arranged in the appropriate position relative to the catalytic residues of Hjc for incision. This step involves two modes of interactions between the protein and DNA. One is the disruption of the base pairs around the junction center, in which the N-terminal segment plays a major part. The other is the interaction of basic residues with DNA, involving the Lys30/Lys31 loop and several basic residues (Arg10, Arg25, and Lys81). After correct positioning, the phosphodiester bonds are cleaved in the nuclease center, composed of the canonical catalytic residues (Glu9, Asp33, Glu46, and Lys48) (27Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K. Shinagawa H. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40385-40391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Base pair disruption is observed in a number of complexes of Holliday junction and the binding proteins; the crystal structure of the E. coli RuvA-Holliday junction complex revealed unpaired bases at the junction center (31Ariyoshi M. Nishino T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8257-8262Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast CceI andE. coli RuvC also distort base pairs around the crossover point (15Bennett R.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21White M.F. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and in particular, the Phe69 side chain in RuvC appears to make a stacking interaction with the base pairs near the junction center (22Yoshikawa M. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10432-10436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). S. solfataricus Hjc also disrupts base pairs (20Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and as shown by the present study, the N-terminal segment appears to play a major role in this process. Previous modeling of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex has indicated that this segment is close to a phosphate backbone and might interact with the DNA minor groove (12Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the present crystal structure has highlighted the importance of the conformational flexibility of N-terminal segment, in both the induced fit mechanism and the correctly positioning of the segment close to the junction center. The disruption mechanism should be solved to prove our hypothesis, although it is possible that the base pair disruption is caused by simple tension resulting from the interaction between the peptide groups of the N-terminal segment and the DNA. The primary sequence of the N-terminal segment contains an aromatic residue, but it is not well conserved (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, since we have expressed recombinant Hjc in E. coli, there may be some modification within this region in the native form. However, our biochemical analyses suggested that both the Holliday junction binding and cleavage activity are similar between the native and the recombinant Hjcs (24Komori K. Sakae S. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8873-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we presume that drastic modification would not be taking place in theP. furiosus cells.During our manuscript preparation, the crystal structure of Hjc fromS. solfataricus was reported (32Bond C.S. Kvaratskhelia M. Richard D. White M.F. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5509-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The structure was similar to that of P. furiosus Hjc with a root mean square displacement value of 2.4 Å for residues 6–114. Interestingly, inS. solfataricus Hjc, two regions, the N-terminal segment and Lys30/Lys31 loop, were structurally disordered. The flexibility of the N-terminal segment agrees well with our data forP. furiosus Hjc. In addition, the flexibility of the Lys30/Lys31 loop is intriguing, because our mutational and biochemical analyses suggest its involvement in DNA recognition and cleavage.In conclusion, our structural and mutational analyses of Hjc have revealed the individual roles of various regions, which are important for the recognition and cleavage of Holliday junction. In particular, the flexible N-terminal segment greatly enhances the stability of the enzyme-junction DNA complex and contributes to the correct positioning of the cleavage site of the DNA to the catalytic site of Hjc. The present data have provided clearer insights into the tertiary structural view of the Hjc-Holliday junction complex. The elucidation of the precise recognition mechanism must await the Hjc-Holliday junction complex structure at atomic resolution.

https://openalex.org/W2009332579,"We present a mutational analysis of vaccinia topoisomerase that highlights the contributions of five residues in the catalytic domain (Phe-88 and Phe-101 in helix α1, Ser-204 in α5, and Lys-220 and Asn-228 in α6) to the DNA binding and transesterification steps. When augmented by structural information from exemplary type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases in different functional states, the results suggest how closure of the protein clamp around duplex DNA and assembly of a functional active site might be orchestrated by internal conformational changes in the catalytic domain. Lys-220 is a constituent of the active site, and a positive charge at this position is required for optimal DNA cleavage. Ser-204 and Asn-228 appear not to be directly involved in reaction chemistry at the scissile phosphodiester. We propose that (i) Asn-228 recruits the Tyr-274 nucleophile to the active site by forming a hydrogen bond to the main chain of the tyrosine-containing α8 helix and that (ii) contacts between Ser-204 and the DNA backbone upstream of the cleavage site trigger a separate conformational change required for active site assembly.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The type IB enzymes relax supercoiled DNA via a multistep reaction pathway entailing noncovalent binding of the topoisomerase to duplex DNA, cleavage of one DNA strand with formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, strand passage, and strand religation. The poxvirus topoisomerases display stringent specificity for transesterification at DNA sites containing the sequence 5′-(C/T)CCTT↓ immediately 5′ of the scissile bond. This specificity has facilitated a detailed kinetic analysis of the chemical steps of the topoisomerase IB reaction using defined DNA substrates containing a single CCCTT↓cleavage site. The 314-amino acid vaccinia virus topoisomerase consists of two structural modules (see Fig. 1). A 234-amino acid carboxyl segment, Topo-(81–314), comprises an autonomous catalytic domain that performs the same repertoire of reactions as the full-sized vaccinia topoisomerase: relaxation of supercoiled DNA, site-specific DNA transesterification, and DNA strand transfer (2Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11589-11595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the catalytic domain reveals an oblong-shaped globular protein consisting of 10 α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet packed against one surface (3Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The smaller N-terminal domain forms a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet with two short α-helices and connecting loops (4Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A.

Lys-167, which sits atop the loop connecting β-strands 2 and 3 of the catalytic domain, serves as a general acid during the cleavage reaction, donating a proton to expel the 5′-OH leaving group (21Krogh B.O.

The catalytic residues of vaccinia topoisomerase are conserved in nuclear topoisomerase IB and tyrosine recombinases, and they occupy similar positions in the tertiary structures of those proteins (10Redinbo M.R.

Tyrosine recombinases have a two-domain structure, and they also form a C-shaped clamp around the DNA duplex with the N-terminal domain on the major groove face and the C-terminal catalytic domain on the minor groove face containing the scissile phosphate. Yet the structures of the N-terminal domains of tyrosine recombinases are not conserved from one recombinase to another and are completely different from those of type IB topoisomerases (4Sharma A.

To gain insights into the structural basis for DNA binding and transesterification by poxvirus topoisomerases, we have undertaken a comprehensive mutational analysis of the vaccinia virus protein. Testing the effects of mutations at 140 individual amino acids (16Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S.

Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7944-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) has thus far identified 10 residues that play important roles in transesterification (Arg-130, Gly-132, Tyr-135, Lys-167, Ser-204, Lys-220, Arg-223, Asn-228, His-265, and Tyr-274) and seven residues that contribute to DNA binding affinity (Arg-67, Tyr-70, Tyr-72, Arg-80, Arg-84, Phe-200, and Ser-204) (see Fig. 1). Here we extended the mutational analysis by performing an alanine scan of 15 new residues within the catalytic domain (see Fig. 1). Our findings illuminate roles for Phe-88 and Phe-101 in DNA binding, most likely at the clamp closure step. We also study the effects of conservative substitutions at residues Ser-204, Lys-220, and Asn-228, which had been previously defined via alanine scanning as important for DNA cleavage (18Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29Wang L.K. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7944-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The results suggest that Lys-220 is a constituent of the active site, whereas Ser-204 and Asn-228 facilitate conformational rearrangements of the catalytic domain during assembly of the active site. Mutations were introduced into the vaccinia virus topoisomerase gene by using the two-stage polymerase chain reaction overlap extension method (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar).NdeI-BglII restriction fragments containing the mutated topoisomerase genes were cloned into the T7-based expression vector pET3c. All mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. pET-Topo plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coliBL21. Topoisomerase expression was induced by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (31Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant topoisomerases were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by phosphocellulose chromatography (31Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the phosphocellulose preparations were determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. An 18-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, then gel-purified, and hybridized to a complementary 30-mer strand. Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and topoisomerase as specified were incubated at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding SDS to 1%. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The extent of covalent adduct formation (expressed as the percentage of the input 5′32P-labeled oligonucleotide that was transferred to protein) was quantitated by scanning the dried gel using a FUJIX BAS2500 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. Cleavage rate constants (kcl) were determined by normalizing the data to the end point values (redefined as 100) and fitting to the equation 100 − %Cleavage(norm) = 100e−kt. Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and 75 ng of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C to form the covalent intermediate. Religation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of NaCl to 0.5 m and a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer acceptor strand (5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA) to attain a 50-fold molar excess of acceptor over the input DNA substrate. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at serial time points and quenched immediately in an equal volume of buffer containing 2% SDS, 76% formamide, and 20 mm EDTA. A time 0 sample was withdrawn prior to addition of the acceptor strand. The samples were heat-denatured and then electrophoresed through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA. Religation of the covalently bound 12-mer strand to the 18-mer acceptor DNA yielded a 5′ 32P-labeled 30-mer strand transfer product. The extent of religation (expressed as the percentage of the input labeled 18-mer strand recovered as 30-mer) was plotted as a function of reaction time. The data were normalized to the end point values, and krel was determined by fitting the data to the equation 100 − %Religation(norm) = 100e−kt. A 60-mer oligonucleotide containing a centrally placed CCCTT element (17Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was 5′-end-labeled, then gel-purified, and annealed to an unlabeled complementary 60-mer strand. Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of the 60-bp1 DNA duplex, and topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding SDS to 1%. The samples were digested for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K, then adjusted to 47% formamide, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in Tris borate-EDTA. The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 30-mer bound to a short peptide, was resolved from the input 60-mer substrate. The extent of strand cleavage was quantitated by scanning the gel with a PhosphorImager. The cleavage equilibrium constant (Kcl) is defined as the ratio of covalently bound DNA to noncovalently bound DNA at the reaction end point under conditions of saturating enzyme and was calculated according to the equation Kcl = % Cleavage/(100 − % Cleavage). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of the 5′32P-labeled 60-bp duplex DNA, and vaccinia topoisomerase as specified were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The mixtures were adjusted to 5% glycerol and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a native 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris borate, 1.2 mm EDTA. Free DNA and topoisomerase-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography of the dried gel. New mutations were introduced in two regions of vaccinia topoisomerase: (i) the segment from positions 88 to 124 comprising the first two α-helices of the catalytic domain and (ii) a C-terminal segment from positions 296 to 299 comprising the proximal portion of the last α-helix of the catalytic domain (3Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Eleven positions in α1 and α2 were substituted by alanine to yield the following mutants: F88A, R90A, R97A, N99A, F101A, N103A, K104A, K107A, and K108A in α1 and Q116A and E124A in α2. Four mutations were made in α10: T296A, F297A, D298A, and E299A. The residues mutated are denoted bydots in Fig. 1. Note that Phe-88, Phe-101, Glu-124, and Glu-299 of vaccinia topoisomerase are conserved in the topoisomerases of six other vertebrate poxviruses of widely different host range (Shope fibroma virus, myxoma virus, Yaba monkey tumor virus, molluscum contagiosum virus, orf virus, and fowlpox virus) and two insect poxviruses (Amsacta mooreientomopoxvirus and Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxvirus) (Fig. 1). The wild-type and mutant proteins were produced in E. coli and purified from soluble bacterial extracts. The topoisomerase polypeptide constituted the major species in the protein preparations as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the extents of purification were essentially equivalent (Fig.2A and data not shown). To assess the impact of these mutations, all proteins were tested for their ability to relax supercoiled plasmid DNA. Screening assays were performed in 0.1m NaCl in the absence of magnesium. The rate-limiting step under these conditions is the dissociation of topoisomerase from the relaxed plasmid product (32Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29760-29764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rates of relaxation were determined at a fixed level of input protein; 2.7 ng of wild-type topoisomerase relaxed 0.3 μg of supercoiled pUC19 DNA to completion within 1 min (Fig. 2B, +NaCl). Relatively few reaction products of intermediate superhelicity were observed with the wild-type topoisomerase, suggesting that the enzyme relaxed individual DNA molecules to completion before dissociating and engaging a new DNA. The DNA relaxation assays were also performed in the presence of 0.1m NaCl plus 5 mm MgCl2. Magnesium enhances product off-rate without affecting the rate of DNA cleavage by the wild-type topoisomerase (32Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Magnesium stimulated the activity of the wild-type enzyme such that 2.7 ng of enzyme relaxed all supercoils in 15–30 s (Fig. 2B, +NaCl+MgCl2). We observed that the relaxation rates of 13 of the 15 alanine-substituted proteins were equivalent to that of the wild-type enzyme in the absence and presence of magnesium: these were R90A, R97A, N99A, N103A, K104A, K107A, K108A, Q116A, E124A, T296A, F297A, D298A, and E299A (data not shown). These 13 mutants also displayed wild-type activity in covalent adduct formation on a CCCTT-containing suicide cleavage substrate (not shown). On the basis of these findings, we concluded that the side chains of Arg-90, Arg-97, Asn-99, Asn-103, Lys-104, Lys-107, Lys-108, Gln-116, Glu-124, Thr-296, Phe-297, Asp-298, and Glu-299 are unimportant for topoisomerase function in vitro. These proteins were not analyzed further. Substitution of Phe-88 and Phe-101 by alanine had little effect on the kinetics of DNA relaxation in the presence of 0.1m NaCl as gauged by the decay of the supercoiled substrate, but the mutations appeared to increase the abundance of partially relaxed intermediates compared with wild-type topoisomerase (Fig.2B, +NaCl). The F88A and F101A mutants displayed an aberrant response to magnesium. Neither protein was stimulated by magnesium; indeed their rates of relaxation were actuallylower by a factor of 4–5 in the presence of 5 mm magnesium than in its absence (Fig. 2B, +NaCl +MgCl2). Therefore, the rates of relaxation by F88A and F101A in the presence of NaCl plus magnesium were reduced by a factor of 10–20 vis à vis wild-type topoisomerase. The paradoxical inhibition of F88A and F101A by magnesium (in contrast to the stimulatory effect on wild-type enzyme) suggested that these mutants had altered affinity for DNA. To determine which component step(s) of the topoisomerase reaction was affected by the F88A and F101A mutations, we subjected the mutant proteins to further biochemical characterization as described below. The wild-type topoisomerase was analyzed in parallel. A suicide substrate containing a single CCCTT↓ cleavage site for vaccinia topoisomerase was used to examine the transesterification reaction under single-turnover conditions in the absence of added salt and magnesium. The substrate consisted of an 18-mer scissile strand annealed to a 30-mer strand (Fig.2C). Upon formation of the covalent protein-DNA adduct, the distal cleavage product 5′-ATTCCC is released and the topoisomerase becomes covalently trapped on the DNA. The extent of cleavage of 0.3 pmol of DNA substrate by the wild-type topoisomerase during a 5-min reaction was proportional to added enzyme and reached saturation at 37 ng of protein at which point >90% of the input CCCTT DNA strand became covalently bound. The concentration dependence of covalent adduct formation by F88A and F101A was the same as that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2C). We measured the rates of DNA cleavage by wild-type topoisomerase, F88A, and F101A under conditions of enzyme excess. The apparent rate constant (kcl) for the wild-type enzyme was 0.34 s−1, whereas the rate constants for F88A and F101A were 0.21 and 0.17 s−1, respectively (not shown). The religation reaction was studied under single-turnover conditions by assaying the ability of the covalent intermediate to transfer the covalently held 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer strand to a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer strand to form a 30-mer product (34Sekiguchi J. Cheng C. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15721-15728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The rates of single-turnover religation by covalently bound wild-type topoisomerase, F88A, and F101A were indistinguishable within the limits of detection of the manually performed kinetic assay (krel ≥ 0.3 s−1) (not shown). Transesterification was also examined under equilibrium conditions by reacting wild-type topoisomerase, F88A, and F101A with a 60-bp DNA duplex containing a centrally placed CCCTT cleavage site (17Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The extent of cleavage of 0.3 pmol of the 60-bp DNA substrate by the wild-type topoisomerase and F88A during a 5-min reaction was proportional to added enzyme and reached saturation at 75 ng of protein at which point 23% of the input DNA became covalently bound (Kcl = 0.3) (not shown). F101A cleaved 17% of the CCCTT DNA strand at saturation (Kcl = 0.2). The slightly lower cleavage equilibrium constant for F101A was consistent with the modest reduction in single-turnover rate constant for the forward cleavage step (note that Kcl =kcl/krel). Single-turnover DNA cleavage reactions are routinely performed at low ionic strength in the absence of a divalent cation. The rate of single-turnover cleavage by the wild-type vaccinia topoisomerase is unaffected by the levels of salt and magnesium that strongly stimulate DNA relaxation under steady-state conditions. It has been argued that salt and magnesium stimulate relaxation by enhancing product dissociation rather than by affecting the chemical steps of transesterification (32Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 33Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29760-29764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that DNA relaxation by the F88A and F101A mutant enzymes was either unstimulated or actually inhibited by magnesium plus salt suggested that pre-cleavage binding might be limiting under these conditions. To address this issue, we examined the effects of salt and magnesium on single-turnover cleavage. The amounts of covalent adduct formed in 10 s in the presence of 50, 100, and 150 mm NaCl or 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mm MgCl2 were measured and normalized to the extent of cleavage in unsupplemented control reactions (Fig. 3). We observed that the wild-type topoisomerase was unaffected by up to 100 mm NaCl but was inhibited by 42% at 150 mm NaCl. In contrast, covalent adduct formation by F88A and F101A was salt-sensitive. F88A was inhibited by 65% at 100 mm NaCl and by 96% at 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 3A). Transesterification by F101A was reduced by 87% at 100 mm NaCl and essentially eliminated at 150 mm NaCl (Fig. 3A). Wild-type topoisomerase was unaffected by magnesium up 10 mm, whereas F88A and F101A"
