https://openalex.org/W2129572698,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe central visual impairment among the elderly and is associated both with environmental factors such as smoking and with genetic factors. Here, 167 unrelated AMD patients were screened for alterations in ABCR , a gene that encodes a retinal rod photoreceptor protein and is defective in Stargardt disease, a common hereditary form of macular dystrophy. Thirteen different AMD-associated alterations, both deletions and amino acid substitutions, were found in one allele of ABCR in 26 patients (16%). Identification of ABCR alterations will permit presymptomatic testing of high-risk individuals and may lead to earlier diagnosis of AMD and to new strategies for prevention and therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2093477805,"Copper is distributed to distinct localizations in the cell through diverse pathways. We demonstrate here that the delivery of copper to copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is mediated through a soluble factor identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae LYS7 and human CCS (copperchaperone for SOD). This factor is specific for SOD1 and does not deliver copper to proteins in the mitochondria, nucleus, or secretory pathway. Yeast cells containing alys7Δ null mutation have normal levels of SOD1 protein, but fail to incorporate copper into SOD1, which is therefore devoid of superoxide scavenging activity. LYS7 and CCS specifically restore the biosynthesis of holoSOD1 in vivo. Elucidation of the CCS copper delivery pathway may permit development of novel therapeutic approaches to human diseases that involve SOD1, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

However, testing of this hypothesis has been hampered by the lack of knowledge regarding the mechanism by which SOD1 acquires copperin vivo. Recent studies indicate that the delivery of copper to specific proteins is mediated through distinct intracellular pathways of copper trafficking. We have previously identified a soluble copper carrier, yeast ATX1 and its human homologue HAH1, that specifically function in the delivery of copper to transport ATPases in the secretory pathway (13Klomp L.W.J.

We therefore predicted that the insertion of copper into SOD1 would likewise involve a specific metal carrier or “copper chaperone.” Overlapping cDNA clones corresponding to ESTs homologous to LYS7 (GenBank™ accession numbersH58006 and AA085445) were obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO) and sequenced using a fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Perkin-Elmer) followed by analysis on a Perkin-Elmer ABI 373A XL sequencer. A 1068-base pair cDNA sequence was identified containing an 822-base pair open reading frame, which was termed CCS (GenBank™ accession number AF000210). RNA blot analysis was performed as described previously (13Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) using commercially obtained membranes containing poly(A)+ RNA from different human and fetal tissues (CLONTECH) or isolated from human cell lines. To construct the CCS expressing plasmid pSMCCS, the coding region of human CCS was amplified by PCR and inserted at the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pSM703, placing CCS under the control of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae PGK1 (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter. The pHAL7 plasmid expressing the epitope-tagged LYS7-HA protein was obtained by first amplifying LYS7 sequences −440 to the stop codon by PCR using a downstream primer that converted the termination codon to a NdeI site. This modified LYS7 fragment was then inserted at the ApaI and NdeI sites of the LEU2 CEN vector, pA2HA-cen, resulting in the in-frame fusion of LYS7 to two copies of the HA epitope from influenza virus (17Lin S.J.

Construction of the sod2Δ::URA3plasmid pGSOD2 was as follows: S. cerevisiae SOD2 sequences −680 to −80 with respect to the start codon were amplified by PCR and directionally inserted at the BamHI and HindIII sites of pRS306, an URA3 integrating vector (19Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).SOD2 sequences +560 to +1700 were then directionally inserted in this plasmid at SpeI and BamHI sites. The resultant pGSOD2 plasmid was linearized by digestion with BamHI and used to delete the chromosomalSOD2 gene of strain 1783 (20Slekar K.H. Kosman D. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), creating strain JS002. For analysis of SOD1 activity by NBT (nitro blue tetrazolium), cells were grown in 50 ml of YPD medium (22Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978: 163-168Google Scholar) to an A 600 of 1.0, were harvested and washed once in cold H2O, and the resultant cell pellet resuspended in 0.5 ml of a lysis buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then broken by glass bead homogenization and glycerol added at a final concentration of 5%. 20 μg of the resultant cell extract were applied directly without boiling to a nondenaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained as prescribed (23Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar) in a solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 275 μg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 65 μg/ml riboflavin and 3.2 μl/ml Temed. After 45-min incubation in the dark, the blue NBT stain for O·̄2was developed by exposure to light. Staining was absent at sites of O·̄2 scavenging (23Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were carried out as prescribed (17Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol.

Kosman, SUNY, Buffalo, NY) and a polyclonal PMA1 antibody from rabbit (obtained from J. Boeke, Johns Hopkins) were used at 1:5000 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively, and were detected using as secondary antibody, anti-rabbit donkey IgG, at a 1:10,000 dilution (Amersham Corp.). LYS-HA was detected using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody from mouse (BABCO) diluted 1:10,000 and as secondary antibody, sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Corp.). All three secondary antibodies were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and detection involved the Hybond ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy utilized strain AA255 (25Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) transformed with pHAL7. Yeast cells were grown to anA 600 of 1.0 in minimal medium and were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy precisely as described (17Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Incubation with mouse anti-HA (BABCO) diluted 1:1000 proceeded for 2 h, and detection of LYS-HA was carried out with a FITC labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Nucleic acids were stained by DAPI (Sigma), as described (17Lin S.J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6303-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling studies, yeast strains were labeled with 200 μCi of 64Cu as described previously (13Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of a lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin and subjected to glass bead homogenization for 30 min at 4 °C. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of cytosolic protein were analyzed on 10% nondenaturing, nonreducing polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography for 1 h to detect holoSOD1. Incorporation of64Cu into FET3 was analyzed as described previously (13Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D. Culotta V.C. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). A yeast genetic approach was utilized to identify the copper chaperone for SOD1. We predicted that a yeast mutant for the SOD1 copper chaperone would lack SOD1 activity and would exhibit the same phenotypes as a sod1Δ null mutant. Yeast cells lacking SOD1 are auxotrophic for methionine and lysine when grown in air (26Bermingham-McDonogh O. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4789-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski L. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We noted that the previously characterized lys7complementation group of S. cerevisiae is also auxotrophic for both lysine and methionine. As with sod1Δ mutants, the dependence of lys7Δ cells for lysine and methionine is only observed in the presence of oxygen (Fig.1), suggesting that SOD1 and LYS7 may be functionally related. LYS7 was recently cloned in the laboratory of G. Sprague (29Horecka J. Kinsey P.T. Sprague G.F. Gene ( Amst .). 1995; 162: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and the deduced amino acid sequence is shown in Fig. 2 A.

We identified multiple human ESTs homologous to LYS7, and sequence analysis revealed the complete open reading frame of the human LYS7 homologue, which we have termed CCS (copper chaperone for SOD1). Human CCS is encoded by a single copy gene on chromosome 11 (data not shown), which is ubiquitously expressed in all human tissues and cell types examined (Fig. 2 B). Overall, human CCS and yeast LYS7 share 28% amino acid identity (Fig. 2 A). CCS also exhibits notable homology to SOD1, and a partial CCS sequence was previously identified as human SOD4 (accession number 1608528). To test whether CCS is a functional homologue of LYS7 or SOD, the CCS open reading frame was placed under the control of the yeast constitutivePGK1 promoter and was used to transform sod1Δand lys7Δ yeast. The expressed CCS gene failed to complement a sod1Δ mutation, and no SOD activity was associated with CCS (not shown). In comparison, the same CCS clone fully restored the aerobic growth of lys7Δ mutants on medium lacking lysine and methionine (Fig. 1), demonstrating that human CCS is a functional homologue to yeast LYS7.Figure 2A, sequence alignment of S. cerevisiae LYS7 and human CCS. The deduced amino acid sequence of CCS was aligned with LYS7; regions of amino acid identity are indicated by shading, and the putative copper binding motifs are shown in the boxed region. B, expression of the human CCS gene. RNA from the indicated tissues or cell lines was hybridized using a32P-labeled CCS-specific cDNA probe and exposed to film for 24 h. This analysis revealed a major CCS-specific transcript of 1.2 kilobases as well as multiple higher molecular weight species in all tissues and cell lines as shown. Identical transcripts were observed in RNA samples from 31 additional human adult and fetal tissues, including multiple regions of the central nervous system. Results are representative of three independent blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether LYS7 was essential for SOD1 activity, we examined SOD activity in lys7Δ cell lysates run on nonreducing polyacrylamide gels and exposed to nitro blue tetrazolium (23Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3 A, thelys7Δ mutant mimicked a sod1Δ mutant and displayed no SOD1 activity, but exhibited normal levels of O·̄2scavenging by SOD2. By Western blot analysis of these same lysates,lys7Δ mutants contained wild type levels of SOD1 protein (Fig. 3 B), demonstrating that the SOD1 polypeptide inlys7Δ mutants is inactive for O·̄2 scavenging. To directly determine if the lack of SOD1 activity observed inlys7Δ mutants was due to a defect in copper incorporation into SOD1, yeast strains were metabolically labeled with 64Cuin vivo. In this analysis, wild type cells exhibited a single 64Cu-labeled protein corresponding to SOD1 (Fig.3 C), confirmed by Western blotting of this same gel (data not shown). Notably, lys7Δ mutants were devoid of64Cu-labeled SOD1, and this defect was complemented by a episomal plasmid harboring human CCS (Fig. 3 C). Thus,LYS7 is essential for copper incorporation into SOD1, and this function is conserved in the human homologue, CCS. The subcellular localization of LYS7 was examined using a HA epitope-tagged protein. When expressed on a low copy centromeric vector, LYS7-HA fully complemented a lys7Δ mutation (not shown) and was observed to migrate as a single band on SDS gels (Fig.4 A). Extracts from cells expressing LYS-HA were resolved into soluble and membrane-associated components, and as expected for a soluble protein, LYS-HA co-fractionated with cytosolic SOD1 to the supernatant, but was absent in the membrane fraction containing the proton ATPase (PMA1; Ref. 37Serrano R. Kielland B.M. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). When examined by immunofluorescence microscopy, LYS7-HA exhibited diffuse staining throughout the cytosol and was largely excluded from the nucleus. LYS7 is therefore cytosolic, as is the case for its recipient of copper delivery, SOD1. LYS7 is highly specific for SOD1. The protein is not needed for copper trafficking to cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondria, aslys7Δ mutants are not defective for electron transport (data not shown). Additionally, LYS7 does not deliver copper to the nucleus for the regulation of metallothionein genes by the ACE1 trans-activator (38Thiele D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 39Welch J. Fogel S. Buchman C. Karin M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); metallothionein gene transcription is unaffected in lys7Δ mutants (not shown). LYS7also does not participate in the delivery of copper to the secretory pathway, as lys7Δ cells were found to be fully functional for incorporating 64Cu into FET3 (Fig. 3 D). As additional evidence for the specificity of the LYS7 pathway, overexpression of another copper chaperone, ATX1, could not rescue the SOD1 copper labeling defect of lys7Δ mutants (Fig.3 C). Hence, distinct pathways of copper trafficking are mediated by ATX1 and LYS7. Although the molecular nature of the specificity of the ATX1/HAH1 and LYS7/CCS copper trafficking pathways has not yet been assessed, it is likely to involve protein-protein interactions between the metal chaperone and its copper-requiring recipient. For example, the homology of CCS with human SOD1 may facilitate metal transfer from the MTCXXC metal binding site in CCS to the copper binding site in SOD1. Taken together, the studies presented here demonstrate that copper incorporation into SOD1 in intact cells is absolutely dependent on the presence of LYS7/CCS. Recent studies suggest that under normal conditions, approximately one-third of the total cellular SOD1 exists as the apoprotein (40Petrovic N. Comi A. Ettinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28331-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus copper loading of SOD1 by LYS7/CCS may represent a novel method of controlling enzyme activity at the posttranslational level. It is noteworthy that purified apoSOD1 will readily reconstitute with copper in vitro (1McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Forman H.J. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2645-2649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Beem K.M. Rich W.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Why is there a requirement for LYS7 in vivo? Presumably, the presence of multiple copper binding factors in an intact cell limits available copper, thus creating the need for a SOD1-specific chaperone, as well as chaperones for other copper proteins such as cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondria and the copper-transporting ATPases in the secretory pathway. It is therefore not surprising that copper chaperones such as ATX1, COX17, and LYS7 are found widespread among organisms as diverse as human and yeast (13Klomp L.W.J. Lin S.J. Yuan D. Klausner R.D.

Genet. 1997; 99: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Identification of the pathway of copper delivery to SOD1 may provide a useful approach to further examine the role of copper in SOD1-mediated familial ALS. For example, deletion of the murine CCS gene will permit direct testing of the role of aberrant SOD1 copper chemistry in motor neuron degeneration in transgenic mice expressing ALS mutant SOD1. As such, these studies may lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches to prevent or ameliorate such injury in patients with SOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We thank T. V. O'Halloran for his many useful discussions and his suggestion of the term chaperone to describe these newly identified copper transport proteins. We also thank J. K. Bhattacharjee for discussions on LYS7 and G. Sprague for the lys7Δ mutant and wild type strains."
https://openalex.org/W2013029120,"The mechanism of neurodegeneration in CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion diseases is unknown but is thought to occur at the protein level. Here, in studies of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), we show that the disease protein ataxin-3 accumulates in ubiquitinated intranuclear inclusions selectively in neurons of affected brain regions. We further provide evidence in vitro for a model of disease in which an expanded polyglutamine-containing fragment recruits full-length protein into insoluble aggregates. Together with recent findings from transgenic models, our results suggest that intranuclear aggregation of the expanded protein is a unifying feature of CAG/polyglutamine diseases and may be initiated or catalyzed by a glutamine-containing fragment of the disease protein."

https://openalex.org/W2020278806,"Classical late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (LINCL) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease whose defective gene has remained elusive. A molecular basis for LINCL was determined with an approach applicable to other lysosomal storage diseases. When the mannose 6-phosphate modification of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes was used as an affinity marker, a single protein was identified that is absent in LINCL. Sequence comparisons suggest that this protein is a pepstatin-insensitive lysosomal peptidase, and a corresponding enzymatic activity was deficient in LINCL autopsy specimens. Mutations in the gene encoding this protein were identified in LINCL patients but not in normal controls."
https://openalex.org/W2059313753,"The vomeronasal organ (VNO) mediates detection of pheromones related to social and reproductive behavior in most terrestrial vertebrates. We have identified a new multigene family of G protein-linked receptors (V2Rs) that are specifically expressed in the VNO. V2Rs have no significant homology to other putative pheromone receptors (V1Rs) or to olfactory receptors but are related to the Ca2+-sensing receptor and metabotropic glutamate receptors. V2Rs are expressed at high levels in small subpopulations of VNO neurons. V2Rs are primarily expressed in a different layer of VNO neurons from V1Rs, thus both gene families are likely to encode mammalian pheromone receptors."

Expression of 1α(OH)ase was suppressed by 1α,25(OH) 2 D 3 in VDR +/+ and VDR +/ − mice but not in VDR − / − mice. These results indicate that the negative feedback regulation of active vitamin D synthesis is mediated by 1α(OH)ase through liganded VDR."
https://openalex.org/W1994662389,"An early and highly specific decrease in glutathione (GSH) in the substantia nigra is associated with Parkinson's disease, and low levels of GSH lead to the degeneration of cultured dopaminergic neurons. Using immature cortical neurons and a clonal nerve cell line, it is shown that a decrease in GSH triggers the activation of neuronal 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), which leads to the production of peroxides, the influx of Ca2+, and ultimately to cell death. The supporting evidence includes: 1) inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism and 12-LOX block cell death induced by GSH depletion; 2) there is an increase in 12-LOX activity and a membrane translocation in HT22 cells, and an induction of the enzyme in primary cortical neurons following the reduction of GSH; 3) 12-LOX is directly inhibited by GSH; and 4) exogenous arachidonic acid potentiates cell death. These data show that the LOX pathway is a critical intermediate in at least some forms of neuronal degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2134266820,"The crystal structure of squalene-hopene cyclase from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius was determined at 2.9 angstrom resolution. The mechanism and sequence of this cyclase are closely related to those of 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclases that catalyze the cyclization step in cholesterol biosynthesis. The structure reveals a membrane protein with membrane-binding characteristics similar to those of prostaglandin-H 2 synthase, the only other reported protein of this type. The active site of the enzyme is located in a large central cavity that is of suitable size to bind squalene in its required conformation and that is lined by aromatic residues. The structure supports a mechanism in which the acid starting the reaction by protonating a carbon-carbon double bond is an aspartate that is coupled to a histidine. Numerous surface α helices are connected by characteristic QW-motifs (Q is glutamine and W is tryptophan) that tighten the protein structure, possibly for absorbing the reaction energy without structural damage."
https://openalex.org/W2093421538,"While target-derived neurotrophins are required for the survival of developing neurons in the PNS, the functions of neurotrophins in the CNS are unclear. Mice with a targeted gene deletion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exhibit a wide-based gait. Consistent with this behavioral evidence of cerebellar dysfunction, there is increased death of granule cells, stunted growth of Purkinje cell dendrites, impaired formation of horizontal layers, and defects in the rostral-caudal foliation pattern. These abnormalities are accompanied by decreased Trk activation in granule and Purkinje cells of mutant animals, indicating that both cell types are direct targets for BDNF. These data suggest that BDNF acts as an anterograde or an autocrine-paracrine factor to regulate survival and morphologic differentiation of developing CNS neurons, and thereby affects neural patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2014134684,"Accelerated cellular repopulation has been described as a response of tumors to fractionated irradiation in both normal tissue and tumor systems. To identify the mechanisms by which cells enhance their proliferative rate in response to clinically used doses of ionizing radiation (IR) we have studied human mammary and squamous carcinoma cells which are autocrine growth regulated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands, transforming growth factor-α and EGF. Both EGF and IR induced EGFR autophosphorylation, comparable levels of phospholipase Cγ activation as measured by inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate production, and as a consequence oscillations in cytosolic [Ca2+]. Activities of Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also stimulated by EGF and IR by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. All these responses to EGF and IR were dependent upon activation of EGFR as judged by the use of the specific inhibitor of EGFR autophosphorylation, tyrphostin AG1478. Importantly, IR-induced proliferation of A431 cells was also inhibited by AG1478. This is the first report which demonstrates a link between IR-induced activation of proliferative signal transduction pathways and enhanced proliferation. We propose that accelerated repopulation of tumors whose growth is regulated by EGFR is initiated by an IR-induced EGFR activation mechanism that mimics the effects of growth factors."

Metal-triggered substrate ionization initiates catalysis, and the alpha-barrel active site serves as a template to channel and stabilize the conformations of reactive carbocation intermediates through a complex cyclization cascade. The core active site structure of the enzyme may be preserved among the greater family of terpenoid synthases, possibly implying divergence from a common ancestral synthase to satisfy biological requirements for increasingly diverse natural products."

https://openalex.org/W2079389107,"ras genes encode members of the small GTP-binding proteins. Ras protein in highly conserved in various species from yeast to humans and plays a key role in signal transduction. Ras is related to cell proliferation and differentiation. While, in addition, mutations in the ras genes are implicated in a variety of tumors. However, the physiological functions and specific roles of each ras gene, H-ras, K-ras and N-ras, are still not fully understood. To clarify the role of the K-Ras in vivo, we generated K-ras mutant mice by gene targeting. In contrast to the findings that H-Ras-deficient mice and N-Ras-deficient mice are born and grow normally, the K-Ras-deficient embryos die progressively between embryonic day 12.5 and term. At embryonic day 15.5, their ventricular walls are extremely thin. Besides, at embryonic day 11.5, they demonstrate increased cell death of motoneurons in the medulla and the cervical spinal cord. Our results thus indicate K-Ras to be essential for normal development in mice and residual Ras composed of H-Ras and N-Ras cannot compensate for the loss of K-Ras function in the mutant mice."
https://openalex.org/W2044142173,"Early cortical progenitor cells of the ventricular zone (VZ) differ from later progenitor cells of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in cell-type generation and their level of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs). To determine whether differences in their behavior are causally related to EGFR number/density, we introduced extra EGFRs into VZ cells with a retrovirus in vivo and in vitro. This results in premature expression of traits characteristic of late SVZ progenitor cells, including migration patterns, differentiation into astrocytes, and proliferation of multipotential cells to form spheres. The choice between proliferation and differentiation depends on ligand concentration and progenitor cell age and may reflect different thresholds of stimulation. The level of EGFRs expressed by progenitor cells in the cortex may therefore contribute to the timing of their maturation and choice of response to pleiotropic environmental signals."

We report cloning of two splice variants of a novel protein, CASH, that contain two N-terminal death effector domains and can bind through them to each other, to MORT1/FADD, to CASP-8, and to CASP-10.

This interaction, which is required for the signaling to death, involves a protein-binding motif called the “death effector domain” (DED) or the “MORT” motif, found in the N-terminal part of MORT1/FADD and in duplicate in the prodomains of CASP-8 and CASP-10. Here we report cloning of a novel protein, CASH, that contains duplicated DED at its N terminus and binds through this region to MORT1/FADD. The C-terminal part of the protein shows marked sequence homology to the corresponding regions in CASP-8 and CASP-10 yet lacks several of the residues that are crucial for cysteine protease activity. Functional tests demonstrated an ability of the novel protein to trigger as well as to inhibit signaling for death. CASHβ was cloned by two-hybrid screening (16Fields S. Song O.

An expressed sequence tag clone (GenBank accession number AA198928) was identified as the mouse homologue of part of the DED region in CASH. Based on this sequence we cloned the mouse CASHα and CASHβ splice variants from mouse liver mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR. The reverse transcriptase reaction was performed with an oligo(dT) adapter primer (5′-GACTCGAGTCTAGAGTCGAC(T)17-3′) and the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first round of PCR was carried out with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) using the following sense and antisense primers: 5′-GGCTTCTCGTGGTTCCCAGAGC-3′ and 5′-GACTCGAGTCTAGAGTCGAC-3′ (adapter) respectively. The second round was performed with Vent polymerase (NEB) using the nested sense primer 5′-TGCTCTTCCTGTGTAGAGATG-3′ and adapter. A radiolabeled mRNA probe corresponding to the DED module region of CASH was prepared using the T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and used for analysis of human multiple tissue blots (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence alignment and homology evaluation were performed using the GAP and PILEUP programs of the GCG package and by the CLUSTAL 1.5 software. Sequence data base search was performed using the BLAST program. As parameter of homology significance we used “smallest sum probability” (P(N)), i.e. the probability of observing by chance a score or a group of scores as high as the observed ones when performing a search of the same size.

The CASH splice variants, the CD95 or CD120a signaling-cascade proteins (all of human origin), and the baculovirus p35 protein were expressed in mammalian cells using the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). β-Galactosidase was expressed using the pCMV-β-gal vector (Promega). The human embryonic kidney 293-T, 293-EBNA, and 293 cells and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (HeLa-Fas; the HtTA-1 clone (obtained from Dr. H. Bujard)) stably expressing transfected human CD95 (established in our laboratory) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells (5 × 105 293 cells or 3 × 105HeLa cells per 6-cm dishes) were transiently transfected with the cDNAs of the indicated proteins together with the pCMV-β-gal, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Each dish was transfected with 5 μg of the pcDNA3 construct of interest or, when transfecting two different constructs, 2.5 μg of each, and 1.5 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector. Cells were rinsed 6–10 h after transfection and then incubated for a further 14 h without additional treatment. Anti-CD95 monoclonal antibody (CH11 (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD), 0.5 μg/ml) and human recombinant TNFα (100 ng/ml) were applied to the cells together with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were then stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (22Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

In all experiments shown, death was assessed 24 h after transfection for HeLa-Fas cells and 20 h after transfection for 293 cells. To search for the proteins that bind to CASP-10 (Mch4/FLICE2), we performed two-hybrid screening of human Jurkat T cell cDNA library using CASP-10 as a bait. This screen yielded cDNA clones of MORT1/FADD, previously shown to bind to CASP-10 (13Vincent C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

Because of the similarity of the protein to the caspases (see below) it was dubbed CASH, for caspase homologue. Northern blot analysis revealed that the molecule exists in at least three distinct transcript sizes, 1.5, 2.4, and 4.0 kilobase pairs (data not shown), whose proportions vary greatly among different tissues. To obtain the full-length cDNA of CASH, we screened human skin fibroblast cDNA library (CLONTECH) with a cDNA probe corresponding to the CASH sequence. We obtained two cDNA species, apparently corresponding to two splice variants of CASH. The proteins encoded by these two cDNAs shared the death effector domain-containing N-terminal region, but their C termini differed. One (CASHβ) had a short C terminus, corresponding to that of the originally cloned cDNA. The other (CASHα) had a long C terminus. The amino acid sequence in this longer C-terminal region showed rather high homology to those of the protease-precursor regions in CASP-8 and CASP-10 (Fig. 1). However, it lacked several of the residues believed to be crucial for protease activity, suggesting that the protein is devoid of cysteine protease activity. Interestingly, CASHα contains a caspase-substrate sequence at the site corresponding to the proteolytic-processing site within the protease regions in CASP-8 and CASP-10 (shaded in Fig. 1). Preliminary data suggest that CASHα can indeed be cleaved at this site by CASP-8. Based on the nucleotide sequence of an expressed sequence tag clone found to correspond to the mouse homologue of part of the DED region in CASH, we cloned the cDNAs of both the mouse CASHα and CASHβ splice variants from mouse liver mRNA by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Sequence comparison revealed high conservation throughout the CASHα molecule (71% identity in DED region and 59% in protease homology region), suggesting that both the DED and protease homology regions in the protein contribute to its function (Fig. 1). Two-hybrid testing of the interactive properties of CASHα and CASHβ (Fig. 2) revealed that both variants interact with MORT1/FADD and CASP-8, most probably through their shared DED regions. Notably, although initially cloned by two-hybrid screening for proteins that bind to CASP-10, CASHβ was found in this test to bind rather weakly to CASP-10, and CASHα did not bind to it at all. The two CASH variants also self-associated and bound to each other, but did not bind RIP or TRADD (adapter proteins that, like MORT1/FADD, contain death domains but lack DEDs), nor did they bind to a number of irrelevant proteins used as specificity controls. To examine the function of CASH, we expressed its two variants transiently in HeLa and 293-T cells and assessed the effects of the transfected proteins on the CD120a-induced signaling for cytotoxicity triggered by TNF or by overexpression of the receptor, as well as on the CD95-induced signaling for cytotoxicity triggered by antibody cross-linking of CD95 or by overexpression of a chimeric receptor comprised of the extracellular domain of CD120a and the intracellular domain of CD95 (Fig. 3). In both cell lines, expression of CASHβ by itself had no effect on cell viability, but it strongly inhibited the induction of cell death by CD120a as well as by CD95. Expression of the CASHα variant affected the two cell lines very differently. In HeLa cells it inhibited the cytotoxicity of CD120a and CD95, similarly to CASHβ. In the 293-T cells, however, it resulted in marked cytotoxicity. Similar cytotoxicity was observed when the protein was expressed in 293-EBNA cells or 293 cells (not shown). This cytotoxic effect could be completely blocked by coexpression of p35, a baculovirus-derived caspase inhibitor (23Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 24Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of the region of protease homology in CASHα to its cytocidal effect, we examined the functions of two mutants of the protein, CASHα(1–385) and CASHα(1–408), with C-terminal deletions at the region corresponding to that part of the protease domain from which the small subunit of the mature protease is derived. Both mutants were devoid of any cytotoxic effect. Moreover, like CASHβ they protected the 293 cells from death induction by CD120a and CD95 (Fig. 3 C). The above findings indicate that CASH can interact with components of the signaling complexes of CD120a and CD95 and that it affects death induction in a way that may differ depending on the identity of the splice variant of CASH and on the cell type in which it is expressed. The inhibition of cytotoxicity induction by CASHβ, and in the case of the HeLa cells also by CASHα, is apparently mediated by the DED region in this protein. It probably reflects competition of the DED of CASH with the corresponding regions in CASP-8 and CASP-10 for binding to MORT1/FADD. Less easy to explain is the way in which CASHα causes death of the 293 cells. The ability of the p35 protein to block this cytotoxic effect indicates that the cytotoxicity is mediated by the activity of caspases. Yet CASHα, even though displaying marked sequence homology to the caspases is unlikely to have cysteine-protease activity because it lacks several of the conserved caspase active site residues. A more likely explanation is that it acts by activating other molecules that do have caspase activity. An intriguing possibility is that CASHα, though unable to act alone as a protease, can still constitute part of an active protease molecule. Crystallographic studies of CASP-1 and CASP-3 structure indicate that the small and large protease subunits in each processed enzyme are derived from distinct proenzyme molecules (25Walker N.P.

In view of the observed dependence of the CASHα cytotoxic activity on intactness of the region corresponding to the small protease subunit (Fig. 3 C), it is tempting to speculate that this region in CASHα can associate with the large subunit region of certain caspase(s) in a way that results in reconstitution of an enzymatically active molecule. The resulting active heterotetramer should then be capable of activating other caspases, thus triggering cell death. The discovery of CASP-8 and CASP-10 and of their association through MORT1/FADD with CD120a and CD95 (7Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D.

It does not, however, provide any clue to the cause of the marked variation in effectivity of death induction by these receptors, even among cells that express the receptors, their adapter proteins, and the caspases at similar levels. Nor does it explain the frequently observed differences in effectivity of death induction by the two receptors. CASH, through its effects on the signaling for death by CD120a and CD95, which vary depending on the identity of the CASH splice variant expressed and perhaps also on the identity of the specific caspases expressed in the cell, may well contribute to these variations in cytotoxicity induction. It should be stressed, however, that transfection studies such as those described here can provide only a partial view of the function of a protein. It is conceivable that at least part of the effects observed when expressing a protein in amounts far higher than its normal levels will turn out to be unrelated to its real function. Complementing these overexpression tests by assessing the effect of decreased expression of CASH, e.g. by deleting the CASH gene, should provide a more reliable notion of the physiological role of this protein.

https://openalex.org/W1995211857,"The tumour suppressor protein p53 is expressed at very low levels in normal cells but accumulates in response to DNA damaging agents such as u.v. irradiation. This increase is accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of the expression of a number of proteins including Mdm2 which can in turn inhibit p53 dependent transcriptional activation, creating a feedback loop resulting in down-regulation of p53 activity. Mutant p53 proteins are however frequently detected at constitutively high levels in many tumours and tumour cell lines, indeed this phenomenon has been used in several studies to diagnose p53 mutation in patient tumours. We show here that expression of mouse mutant p53 in tumour cell lines of this type results in high levels of both the endogenous p53 protein and the exogenously expressed mutant mouse protein, whereas the human tumour line MCF7 does not exhibit high levels of either endogenous human or exogenously expressed mouse mutant p53 unless stabilisation is induced by DNA damage. This suggests that the stability of mutant p53 is not intrinsic to mutant p53 protein structure but may vary in different cell backgrounds. We present evidence that p53 protein stability in tumour cell lines is determined by association with the Mdm2 tumour suppressor protein, and that p53 mutants which are unable to bind Mdm2 are stable in MCF7 cells. We propose that tumour lines which express high levels of transcriptionally inactive mutant p53 are unable to induce the expression of the Mdm2 protein which would normally provide a feedback mechanism down-regulating p53 protein levels in the absence of DNA damage signals. MCF7 cells however express a transcriptionally active p53 and retain the feedback regulation of p53 protein levels by Mdm2."

Whalon M.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). With the introduction of transgenic plants expressing Bt toxins in the field (2Estruch J.J. Carozzi N.B. Desai N. Duck N.B. Warren G.W. Koziel M.G. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), insects will likely be under increased selection pressure for resistance. To develop effective toxin resistance management strategies, a full understanding of the physiological and genetic mechanisms by which insects become resistant to these insecticidal proteins is needed. More than 100 insecticidal crystal protein genes from Bt subspecies have been described. 2For an up to date list and explanation of nomenclature, see:http://epunix.biols.susx.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/toxins.html. 2For an up to date list and explanation of nomenclature, see:http://epunix.biols.susx.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/toxins.html. These genes encode protoxins, referred to as Cry proteins, that have different specificity for lepidopteran, coleopteran, or dipteran insects. The Cry1 subclass consists of lepidopteran-active Bt protoxins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 130 kDa, which are solubilized and processed (activated) by gut enzymes to approximately 65-kDa toxins (4Höfte H. Whiteley H.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 242-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toxins interact with receptors in the guts of susceptible insects resulting in pore formation in midgut cell membranes, ionic imbalance, and consequent septicemia in the insect. Alterations in insect gut physiology or biochemistry could disrupt this sequential process and result in toxin resistance. Several mechanisms of insect resistance to Bt toxins have been proposed (5Gill S.S. Cowles E.A. Pietrantonio P.V. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 615-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One involves changes in the binding of toxins to gut receptors. In a Bt subspecies kurstaki-resistant strain of the Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella, reduced binding of Cry1Ab toxin to larval brush border membrane vesicles was associated with increased resistance to the toxin (6van Rie J. McGaughey W.H. Johnson D.E. Barnett B.D. van Mellaert H. Science. 1990; 247: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Decreases in toxin binding have also been reported in resistant strains of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (7Ferré J. Real M.D. van Rie J. Jansens S. Perferoen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Microbiol. 1997; 63: 1024-1027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore alternate mechanisms of resistance must exist. A second mechanism of resistance may involve gut proteinases that interact with Bt toxins. Enzymes from a strain of H. virescens resistant to Bt subspecies kurstaki (HD-73) were reported to process the protoxin more slowly and to degrade toxin faster than enzymes from a susceptible strain (18Forcada C. Alcácer E. Garcerá M.D. Martı́nez R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1996; 31: 257-272Crossref Google Scholar). In Spodoptera littoralis, an increase in the specific activity of gut proteinases from fifth instar larvae was associated with a loss of sensitivity to Cry1C, possibly due to an increase in the degradation of toxin (19Keller M. Sneh B. Strizhov N. Prudovsky E. Regev A. Koncz C. Schell J. Zilberstein A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that a strain of P. interpunctellaresistant to Bt subspecies entomocidus has low soluble gut proteinase and Bt protoxin-hydrolyzing activities when compared with the parent-susceptible strain and a strain resistant to Bt subspecieskurstaki (20Oppert B.S.

McGaughey W.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The slower protoxin hydrolysis observed with gut extracts from the entomocidus-resistant strain was an indication that proteinase-mediated mechanisms are involved in resistance to Bt. In this report, we characterize the proteolytic enzyme activity in Bt toxin-resistant insects and demonstrate a genetic linkage between the absence of a major gut proteinase and decreased susceptibility to the toxin. Late fourth instar larvae were chilled, and the posterior and anterior ends were removed. Guts were excised, immediately submersed in ice-cold 200 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm CaCl2 (buffer A), aliquoted 1 gut per 25 μl of buffer, and frozen at −20 °C for up to 2 weeks until assayed. For microplate proteinase assays, samples were thawed and spun at 15,000 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant containing soluble gut enzymes was used in assays. Samples were diluted 1:100 in buffer A, and 50 μl were added to a microplate well. N-α-Benzoyl-l-argininep-nitroanilide (BApNA, Sigma, 100 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) was diluted 1:100 in buffer A, and 50 μl were added to each well to initiate the reaction (final BApNA concentration was 1.15 mm). After a 30-s incubation at 37 °C, absorbance was monitored at 405 nm at 15-s intervals over a 5-min period. The change in absorbance per min was calculated by the software KinetiCalc3 (Biotek), and the data were converted to micromoles/min/mg of protein in each gut extract. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard in a microplate assay (Pierce). For proteinase activity blots, gut extracts from individual larvae or from five pooled individuals were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 10–20% Tricine gels (Novex, 0.4 gut eq/lane). The proteinase activity blot procedure was performed as described previously (21Oppert B. Kramer K.J. Johnson D. Upton S.J. McGaughey W.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For zymogram analysis, gut samples were first analyzed for BApNA-hydrolyzing activity by microplate analysis. Volumes of samples were then adjusted for equivalent activity (ΔA 405 nm/min/ml = 2), and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 10–20% Tricine gel (Novex). Zymogram analysis was performed by incubating the gel with a Cry1Ac protoxin substrate solution (see below) for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by brief washes in deionized water and staining with Coomassie Blue, as described previously (21Oppert B. Kramer K.J. Johnson D. Upton S.J. McGaughey W.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cry1Ac protoxin substrate solution was obtained from Bt subspecieskurstaki HD-73 grown on glucose/yeast extract/salts medium at 30 °C for 2–3 days with agitation until sporulation was complete (23Nickerson K.W. St. Julian G. Bulla L.A. Appl. Microbiol. 1974; 28: 129-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Spores, crystals, and cellular debris were washed by centrifugation three times in phosphate-buffered saline and lyophilized. The lyophilized preparation was resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 10.0, 0.8 m sodium chloride, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with deionized water and analyzed for Cry1Ac protoxin concentration by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and scanning gel densitometry (International Technologies International) using homogenous Cry1Ac protoxin as the standard (data not shown). The concentration of Cry1Ac protoxin in the zymogram substrate solution was determined to be 0.3% and constituted greater than 50% of the total protein in the preparation. Fifteen virgin male adults from Bt-susceptible strain 688-s′, in which all individuals displayed the enzyme T1 (see “Results” for explanation of enzyme terminology), were mated with 15 virgin female entomocidus-resistant strain 198-r adults, which lacked T1. Gut extracts from approximately 15-day-old larvae from each strain were analyzed for BApNA hydrolytic patterns by proteinase activity blots. Fifteen female F1 adults were backcrossed to 15 resistant 198-r males, and progeny were analyzed for BApNA hydrolytic patterns. Female F1 were chosen because meiotic recombination does not occur in female Lepidoptera, and tight linkage would be observed between any pair of traits located on the same chromosome. Insects were reared on untreated diet throughout the matings. Ten mg of eggs from the backcrossed progeny were added to an untreated diet, and 15 mg were added to a 125 mg/kg Bt subspecies entomocidus(HD-198)-treated diet. Adults were selected from each group (n = 27 from the untreated group and n= 12 from the treated group) and placed on an untreated diet and allowed to mate. Progeny from each group were reared on an untreated diet, and guts were dissected from late fourth instar larvae. Gut extracts were analyzed for proteolytic patterns using proteinase activity blot analysis. Because trypsin-like proteinases in P. interpunctellaguts activate Bt protoxin (21Oppert B. Kramer K.J. Johnson D. Upton S.J. McGaughey W.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we examined trypsin-like enzyme activity in Bt-susceptible and resistant strains of the Indianmeal moth. Using the trypsin diagnostic substrate BApNA in a microplate assay, BApNA-hydrolyzing activities were detected in a Bt toxin-susceptible strain of P. interpunctella,688-s, and three resistant strains, 133-r, 198-r, and Dpl-r, derived from the susceptible parental strain via selection with spore/crystal preparations of Bt subspecies aizawai(HD-133), entomocidus (HD-198), or kurstaki(HD-1, Dipel®), 3Dipel® is a registered trademark of Abbott Laboratories. respectively (24McGaughey W.H. Johnson D.E. J. Econ. Entomol. 1992; 85: 1594-1600Crossref Google Scholar) (Table I). Specific activities of enzymes in the aizawai- andentomocidus-resistant strains were less than one-half of those in the kurstaki-resistant strain and in the parent-susceptible strain. Activity from thekurstaki-resistant strain was approximately 30% higher than activity from the parent-susceptible strain.Table IBApNA-hydrolyzing activity in gut extracts from a Bt-susceptible strain of P. interpunctella (688s) and strains resistant to Bt subspecies aizawai (133-r), entomocidus (198-r), and kurstaki (Dpl-r) maintained on treated dietsStrainSpecific activity1-aUnits are micromoles/min/mg of protein in gut extract (ε = 0.87 × 104m−1 cm−1, 0.3-cm path length).

The number of individual insects used in each sample was 16 ± S.E. Open table in a new tab Extracts were analyzed for the ability to hydrolyze the substrateN-α-benzoyl-l-argininep-nitroanilide (BApNA). To determine the number and relative size of BApNA-hydrolyzing enzymes in each strain, larval gut extracts from the P. interpunctella strains were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze BApNA using activity blots (Fig.1). Enzymes with relatively high molecular masses (>250 kDa) were observed in extracts from all four strains. Two major BApNA-hydrolyzing enzymes, designated T1 and T2 (apparent molecular masses ∼45 and ∼25 kDa, respectively), were observed in the Bt toxin-susceptible strain (688-s) and also in the Dipel-resistant strain (Dpl-r). The enzyme corresponding to T1, however, was not present in gut extracts from the strains resistant to either subspecies entomocidus (198-r) or subspeciesaizawai (133-r). A minor trypsin-like enzyme, T3, was observed in all of these strains, which had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 50 kDa. To determine whether these trypsin-like enzymes hydrolyze protoxin, an experiment was designed to compare the relative hydrolysis of protoxin by gut extracts from Bt-susceptible and -resistant P. interpunctella strains. Gut proteinases from the four P. interpunctella strains were separated electrophoretically by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was incubated in a solution of Bt subspecieskurstaki (HD-73) spores and crystals containing Cry1Ac protoxin as the major protein (Fig. 2). Dark zones in the zymogram demonstrated activity of enzymes from the gut extracts, which are capable of hydrolyzing proteins in the spore/crystal protein preparation. Major hydrolyzing activity corresponded to enzymes T1 and T2 in the susceptible andkurstaki-resistant strains but only T2 in theaizawai- and entomocidus-resistant strains. T1 and T2 have similar levels of activity. However, T2 appears to have a higher level of activity because it comigrates with another protoxin-hydrolyzing enzyme identified as one with chymotrypsin-like specificity (data not shown). No hydrolysis of protoxin by the higher molecular mass enzymes (i.e. the >250-kDa BApNA-hydrolyzing enzymes) was observed. Until now, BApNA-hydrolyzing enzymes had only been examined in extracts from pooled insects (Fig. 1). When gut extracts from individual susceptible larvae were used in enzyme activity blots, we observed that the strain consisted of a heterogeneous population of insects with respect to the expression of trypsin-like proteinases. Some insects expressed T1 and T2, whereas others expressed only T2 (data not shown). Therefore, single pair lines of susceptible strain 688-s were established to ensure genetic uniformity for subsequent linkage tests, and progeny were analyzed using proteinase activity blots. Progeny from one of these “isofemale” lines, designated as 688-s′, were analyzed for four generations, and it was determined that all individuals in this population expressed both T1 and T2 trypsin-like enzymes (a representative blot is shown in Fig. 3, 688-s′). To determine if the T1 allele cosegregates with toxin resistance inP. interpunctella, bulked segregant analysis was used. Insects from the homogeneous susceptible strain 688-s′ were mated with those from the entomocidus-resistant strain 198-r, and female F1 progeny were subsequently backcrossed to males from the resistant strain. Individual larvae from the parental colonies, the F1 generation, and the backcross were analyzed by proteinase activity blots for BApNA-hydrolyzing enzymes (representative blots are shown in Fig. 3). Based on the analysis of 40 single gut extracts from each strain, the susceptible and resistant strains appeared to be homozygous for the presence and absence, respectively, of the T1 allele. Both parental strains were fixed for T2, since all individuals displayed the T2 enzyme. In the F1 generation, 70 individuals were examined and all exhibited T1 enzyme activity. However, the activity of T1 in the F1 larvae was lower than that in the susceptible strain, consistent with the hypothesis that the F1 were heterozygous for the T1 allele. Of the 70 larvae analyzed for BApNA hydrolytic activity in the backcross, 29 (41%) lacked the T1 enzyme, whereas 41 (59%) expressed both T1 and T2, which is close to the expected 1:1 segregation ratio (χ2 = 2.86, degrees of freedom = 1, p = 0.09). Insects from this backcross population were then analyzed for the ability to survive on toxin-treated diets. Fifty eggs were placed on 0, 125, 250, and 500 mg of Bt subspecies entomocidus HD-198 per kg of diet, and mortality was determined. A discriminating dose of 125 mg/kg was found to kill all susceptible and heterozygous resistant larvae (data not shown). Mortalities at the three Bt toxin doses, corrected for the control mortality, were 59, 78, and 97%, respectively (25Abbott W.S. J. Econ. Entomol. 1925; 18: 265-267Crossref Google Scholar). At the 125 mg/kg dose, 41% of the backcross insects survived, the same proportion of the backcross that lacked the T1 enzyme when reared on untreated diet. The frequency of the T1 enzyme in descendants of backcross progeny survivors reared on untreated versus toxin-treated diets was determined by proteinase activity blots (Fig.4). In the untreated group, 20 out of 50 insects (40%) lacked the T1 trypsin-like proteinase, whereas the remainder had both T1 and T2. To eliminate differences in enzyme activity due to dietary toxin influences, adults from backcross progeny surviving on an untreated or HD-198-treated diet (125 mg/kg of diet) were intercrossed en masse and placed on untreated diet to lay eggs. Resulting larvae were analyzed for proteinase patterns. In the progeny from untreated diet, 30 out of 50 displayed both T1 and T2 enzymes. All of the progeny from the survivors on the Bt-treated diet (50 out of 50), however, lacked the major trypsin-like proteinase T1. Results from a microplate assay of BApNA hydrolysis by P. interpunctella gut extracts demonstrated that activity was reduced in the aizawai- and entomocidus-resistant larvae when compared with kurstaki-resistant or susceptible larvae. We have also observed slower protoxin hydrolysis with enzymes from theaizawai-resistant strain, similar to results obtained with the entomocidus-resistant strain (20Oppert B.S. Kramer K.J. Johnson D.E. MacIntosh S.C. McGaughey W.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 940-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,21Oppert B. Kramer K.J. Johnson D. Upton S.J. McGaughey W.H. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). 4B. Oppert, K. J. Kramer, and W. H. McGaughey, unpublished data. Therefore, resistance may be a result of reduced proteolytic activity in theaizawai- and entomocidus-resistant strains, but it is probably unrelated to proteinase activity in thekurstaki-resistant strain. The kurstaki-resistant strain is probably resistant due to a receptor adaptation, like anotherkurstaki-resistant strain of P. interpunctella(5Gill S.S. Cowles E.A. Pietrantonio P.V. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1992; 37: 615-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from a proteinase activity blot assay using BApNA as the substrate revealed that aizawai- andentomocidus-resistant larvae lack a major BApNA-hydrolyzing enzyme, T1. The absence of T1 activity in these strains was also evident in zymogram analysis of Bt toxin-hydrolyzing activity. Since T1 is a protoxin-hydrolyzing enzyme, the lack of an active T1 in theaizawai- and entomocidus-resistant strains would result in less toxin being generated in the gut. We propose that the absence of this T1 enzyme leads to reduced activation of protoxin and, therefore, provides a survival advantage when insects feed on diets containing Bt toxins. Matings of susceptible insects that have both T1 and T2 enzymes with resistant insects that have only the T1 enzyme resulted in progeny with comparable T2 activity but only a relatively low T1 activity. A backcross of these insects to the resistant strain resulted in progeny consisting of a mixture of phenotypes, with individuals either displaying both T1 and T2 or only T2. All backcross larvae that survived a discriminating dose of Bt toxin lacked the T1 enzyme. Therefore, when insects do not have an active T1, they are able to survive a dose of toxin that is lethal to insects that are homozygous or heterozygous for T1. These data demonstrate a genetic linkage between resistance and the absence of T1 and are strong evidence for a proteinase-mediated mechanism of resistance to Bt. Alleles of structural genes that have no product detectable by electrophoresis are called “null” alleles and are usually recessive (26Pasteur N. Pasteur G. Bonhomme F. Catalan J. Britton-Davidian J. Practical Isozyme Genetics. Ellis Horwood Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1988: 42-44Google Scholar). In other null alleles, the absence of the active enzyme is due to a mutation that results in an inactive protein or prevents its synthesis in some way. Esterase null alleles are the most commonly described. The number of copies of a gene EST-2, coding for esterase B in mosquitoes, is more than 250 times greater in insecticide-resistant mosquitoes than in sensitive strains (3Mouchès C.L. Pasteur N. Bergé J.B. Hyrien O. Robert de Saint-Vincent B. de Silvestri M. Georghiou G.P. Science. 1986; 233: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In that case, the null allele is normal for sensitive insects. In P. interpunctella, however, the null allele is a survival advantage for the Bt-resistant insects. This is the first description of a null allele for a trypsin-like proteinase coding gene of which we are aware. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that some Bt toxin-resistant strains of P. interpunctella have lower BApNA-hydrolyzing and protoxin-activating abilities than a susceptible or another resistant strain. These differences are due to the lack of a major gut trypsin-like proteinase in the resistant strains. Results of a genetic analysis demonstrated that insect resistance to Bt toxins segregated with the loss of this major trypsin-like proteinase. The absence of the trypsin-like enzyme apparently results in reduced levels of toxin in the gut, allowing the insects to avoid exposure to high levels of toxin. This research has led to the understanding that both the genetic variability in the insect population and the composition of the toxin preparation can influence resistance mechanisms. Selection for reduced proteinase activity apparently is possible with only certain Bt preparations. However, these preparations will not select for a proteinase-deficient phenotype if the genotype is not already present in the population. 5B. Oppert, K. J. Kramer, and W. H. McGaughey, unpublished observations. It is not clear how Bt formulations differ such that they elicit different resistance responses in insects. Understanding the biochemical bases for resistance development in insect populations exposed to different Bt formulations will provide for more effective toxin selection, utilization, and durability in integrated pest management programs that utilize Bt toxins. We appreciate the excellent technical assistance provided by Richard Hammel, Roy Speirs, Staci Schmeiser, and Kris Hartzer."

The scrambler (scm) mouse shows abnormal cortical lamination that is indistinguishable from reeler. Genetic and physical mapping of scm identified yeast artificial chromosomes containing an exon of mdab1, a homolog of Drosophila disabled, which encodes a phosphoprotein that binds nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. mdab1 transcripts showed abnormal splicing in scm homozygotes, with 1.5 kb of intracisternal A particle retrotransposon sequence inserted into the mdab1 coding region in antisense orientation, producing a mutated and truncated predicted protein. Therefore, mdab1 is most likely the scm gene, thus implicating nonreceptor tyrosine kinases in neuronal migration and lamination in developing cerebral cortex."

Paranodes play a critical role in the physiological properties of myelinated nerve fibers. Paranodin, a prominent 180 kDa transmembrane neuronal glycoprotein, was purified and cloned from adult rat brain, and found to be highly concentrated in axonal membranes at their junction with myelinating glial cells, in paranodes of central and peripheral nerve fibers. The large extracellular domain of paranodin is related to neurexins, and its short intracellular tail binds protein 4.1, a cytoskeleton-anchoring protein. Paranodin may be a critical component of the macromolecular complex involved in the tight interactions between axons and myelinating glial cells characteristic of the paranodal region."

The elastic extensibility of proximal byssus is extraordinary given its construction of collagen and the limited extension (less than 10 percent) of most collagenous materials. From the complementary DNA, we deduced that the primary structure of a collagenous protein (preCol-P) predominating in the extensible proximal portion of the threads encodes an unprecedented natural block copolymer with three major domain types: a central collagen domain, flanking elastic domains, and histidine-rich terminal domains. The elastic domains have sequence motifs that strongly resemble those of elastin and the amorphous glycine-rich regions of spider silk fibroins. Byssal thread extensibility may be imparted by the elastic domains of preCol-P."

A ttx-3-GFP fusion gene is expressed specifically in the adult AIY interneuron pair, which connects to thermosensory neurons. In ttx-3 mutant animals, the AIY interneuron is generated but exhibits patterns of abnormal axonal outgrowth. Thus, the TTX-3 LIM homeodomain protein is likely to regulate the expression of target genes required late in AIY differentiation for the function of this interneuron in the thermoregulatory pathway. The ttx-3-dependent thermosensory pathway also couples to the temperature-modulated dauer neuroendocrine signaling pathway, showing that ttx-3 specifies AIY thermosensory information processing of both motor and autonomic outputs."

https://openalex.org/W1977582731,"Abstract Exocytotic secretion in neuroendocrine cells is activated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ increases. Late post-docking events in dense core vesicle exocytosis in permeable PC12 cells require cytosolic factors for sequential ATP-dependent priming and Ca2+-dependent triggering steps. The cytosolic proteins phosphatidylinositol transfer protein and phosphatidylinositol (4)-phosphate 5-kinase, as well as membrane-boundN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, are required for the ATP-dependent priming step. Following priming, the Ca2+-dependent triggering of vesicle fusion requires an additional cytosolic factor, CAPS, which was purified as a 145-kDa protein. To clarify late Ca2+-dependent events in vesicle fusion, the sequence of rat CAPS cDNA was determined and found to encode a novel protein that is the vertebrate homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans UNC-31 protein shown genetically to be required for neurosecretion. Recombinant CAPS substituted for cytosol in the Ca2+ triggering step in permeable PC12 cells and exhibited moderate affinity (K d = 270 μm) Ca2+binding (2 mol Ca2+/mol CAPS dimer), consistent with a role at a Ca2+-regulated step in exocytosis."

Here, we demonstrate that the chick optic nerve is populated by oligodendrocyte precursors, which initially appeared in a focal region at the ventral midline of the third ventricle at stage 26–27. Oligodendrocyte precursors migrated into the chiasmal end of the nerve by stage 29 and became uniformly distributed by stage 35. Migrating precursors were restricted to the anterior region of the nerve, closely apposed to axons, and had a bipolar morphology. In contrast to the polysialic acid (PSA)–dependent cooperative streaming migration of olfactory neuronal precursors, the migration of oligodendrocyte precursors along the optic nerve appeared axophilic and unaffected by removal of neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM)–associated PSA. These data indicate that during development, defined domains of the ventricular zone give rise to distinct cell types that utilize discrete mechanisms to navigate specific migrational pathways."

We demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) induces within seconds a large, tyrosine- kinase-dependent increase in calcium channel currents in cerebellar granule neurons. Separation of channel subtypes reveals that, while P, Q, and R channels are unaffected, N and L channel activities are strongly potentiated at specific membrane voltages: N currents triple at depolarized potentials, while L currents rapidly increase 4-fold at hyperpolarized potentials. Moreover, transient expression of dominant-negative and wild-type phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI 3-kinase) subunits, as well as application of specific inhibitors, demonstrates that PI 3-kinase is an essential and rate-limiting messenger in this signaling pathway. Our results indicate that N and L calcium channels are downstream targets of neuronal RTKs and suggest that RTK modulation may control calcium-dependent processes, such as neurotransmitter release and IGF-1-dependent differentiation or survival."

We discuss how the cytosolic function of eIF3-p48 (Int-6) in protein synthesis may account for oncogenesis caused by these two viruses. The initiation phase of protein synthesis in eukaryotes is promoted by 10 or more proteins called initiation factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). Translation frequently is regulated by phosphorylation of the initiation factors, which causes either stimulation or inhibition of their activities. The levels and specific activities of these proteins are important for determining translation rates and for integrating the process of protein synthesis into the cell's overall metabolism. Abberations in regulating initiation factor activities may result in loss of control of cell proliferation and in malignant transformation of cells (2Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism of action and regulation of initiation factors, we have sought to determine their primary structures by cloning and sequencing human cDNAs that encode them. One of the mammalian initiation factors, eIF3, is a multisubunit complex of ∼600 kDa that plays a central role in the pathway of initiation (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). eIF3 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit and acts as a ribosomal subunit anti-association factor. It stabilizes the binding of methionyl-tRNA i to 40S ribosomal subunits and is required for mRNA binding. The 10 subunits of human eIF3 possess apparent masses of 170, 116, 110, 66, 48, 47, 44, 40, 36, and 35 kDa (3Hershey J.W.B. Asano K. Naranda T. Vornlocher H.-P. Hanachi P. Merrick W.C. Biochimie. 1997; 78: 903-907Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of cDNAs encoding the p110 and p36 subunits (4Asano K. Kinzy T.G.

Internal peptide sequencing of purified HeLa eIF3 (8Brown-Luedi M. Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Yau P.M.-P. Corbett S. Hershey J.W.B.

Clones 142907 (GenBank™ accession number R71564), 47908 (H11132 and H11044), and 71140 (T47475 andT47476) were kindly provided by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, CA) and were sequenced on both strands. Plasmid pTZp48 was constructed by subcloning the following PCR DNA fragment into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pTZ19R (9Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar); the 1.3-kb DNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification of a heat-treated human liver cDNA library (Stratagene) with the following primers: oligo-1 (5′-CCCAAGCTTAAGATGGCGGAGTACGACTTGAC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 4–26 in the DNA sequence with accession number U54562, tagged with a HindIII site) and oligo-2 (5′-CCCGGATCCTCAGTAGAAGCCAGAATCTT-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1344–1325, tagged with a BamHI site), and was digested withBamHI and HindIII. Poly(A)+ mRNA purified from mouse FM3A cells was employed for an reverse transcription-PCR reaction (Gene Amp RNA PCR kit, Perkin-Elmer) using the primers 5′-GCGGAATTCCCCGGCAAGATGGCGG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1–17 in accession number U54563, tagged with an EcoRI site) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTCCCATGTTTGTCTGCCAGG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 376–358, tagged with a HindIII site). The resulting 0.4-kb DNA fragment was sequenced and subcloned into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene), followed by sequencing again. The human and corrected mouse sequences are deposited in GenBank™ as U54562 and U54563, respectively. PCR reactions were conducted with 16 human libraries from a QUICK-screen cDNA library panel (CLONTECH) and Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene). For the first amplification, the primers used were oligo 3 (5′-CCCGAATTCATGACTCCAGAAGAAGCTGA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1090–1109 in U54563, tagged with EcoRI) and oligo 2 (described above). For the second amplification, oligo 3 and oligo 7 (5′-GACCCTAAAAGGAAACACAGGGAAATAA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1168–1174, with the antisense sequence of the insertion underlined) were used with 0.2% of the first amplification reaction mixture as template. The conditions were 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 53 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) for the first amplification and 20 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 68 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C) for the second. One-tenth of each reaction was subjected to electrophoresis on a 3% NuSieve GTG agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, which was photographed under UV light. In vitro translation of eIF3-p48 mRNA employed the TnT translation kit (Promega) with CsCl-purified covalently closed circular pTZp48 as template. Immunoprecipitation was conducted essentially as described (4Asano K. Kinzy T.G. Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The immune complexes were isolated with GammaBind G Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), washed, and eluted with SDS. Only a small fraction (<5%) of thede novo synthesized p48 was precipitated with anti-eIF3 (or with anti-p170 antiserum), because p48 alone is not recognized by these antibodies. eIF3 purified from both rabbit reticulocytes and human HeLa cells was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 3 a), and the p48 band was excised. After proteolysis and high pressure liquid chromatography fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the following peptide sequences were obtained: LGHVVMGNNAVSPYXQX(VIEK) from the rabbit protein, and VIQQESSYTYK and NQN(S)R(P/I)(EAPN) from the human factor (uncertain residues are enclosed in parentheses). The rabbit peptide sequence was used to search the nonredundant protein and expressed sequence tag (EST) data bases, and a perfect match of the first 14 amino acid residues was found to the mouse int-6 gene product (10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Gallahan M.S.D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This surprising result suggests that eIF3-p48 corresponds to the int-6 gene product and therefore may be involved in oncogenesis, as discussed in greater detail below. The rabbit peptide sequence also was found in the derived amino acid sequences of 5 human ESTs homologous to murineint-6. Furthermore, the two human peptide sequences match portions of mouse Int-6 and the human homolog. The entireint-6 DNA sequence was used to search the EST data base, and 50 related ESTs were identified. Three overlapping clones (142907, 47098, and 71140; shown in Fig. 1) of human cDNA were selected and kindly provided by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, CA). These were sequenced on both strands and then edited to generate a 1507-bp sequence (accession number U54562) that encodes the human Int-6 homolog, eIF3-p48. One of the human ESTs encoding eIF3-p48 (Int-6), N02633, has been mapped to chromosome 6 with an approximate cytological range of 6q15–21 (from the Whitehead Institute for Biological Research).Figure 1Structures of eIF3-p48 cDNAs.

The human int-6 cDNA sequence is identical to the one already reported (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as U62962, except that the latter lacks 28 bp at the 5′ terminus that includes the correct initiation codon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our identification of the initiator codon in the eIF3-p48 cDNA differs from that presumed in the reported mouse Int-6 cDNA (10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Gallahan M.S.D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frame actually begins at an in-frame upstream AUG that results in a protein with 49 additional N-terminal amino acid residues. The reported murine int-6 sequence (10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Gallahan M.S.D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lacks a C residue following nucleotide 85, which when corrected places in-frame the AUG at nucleotides 62–64 (numbered as in accession number L35556). This C residue is present in our cDNA (U54562) and in the humanint-6 cDNA sequence (U62962) reported previously (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); it is found as well in a mouse cDNA obtained by reverse transcription-PCR amplification of mRNA isolated from mouse FM3A cells as described under “Experimental Procedures” (results not shown). That the upstream AUG is the correct initiation site is suggested by the size of the protein product expressed in the reticulocyte lysate (see Fig. 3 b). The derived amino acid sequence of human eIF3-p48 is identical to the corrected mouse Int-6 sequence; both proteins contain 445 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 52,187 Da. Northern blot analysis of HeLa poly(A)+ mRNAs gave a single 1.6-kb band when probed with DNA from the coding region of p48 (results not shown). Therefore, the 1507-bp DNA reported here as U54562 represents nearly full-length cDNA. eIF3-p48 (Int-6) sequences are found with a frequency of about 0.02% in the human EST data base, with essentially all tissues represented, suggesting that p48 is a ubiquitous, moderately abundant protein, as expected for a subunit of eIF3. Although homologs in many animal and plant species were identified in the data base (results not shown), no homolog of eIF3-p48 was found in the complete Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome data base. A second, more minor difference between the human and mouse cDNAs is the presence in one of the human int-6 clones (47098) of a 21-nucleotide insertion following nucleotide 1170, which lies between the Leu388 and Gly389 codons (Fig. 1). The insertion occurs at the junction of exons 11 and 12, conforms to the 3′ intron consensus sequence (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.7-16.8Google Scholar), and therefore appears to be due to alternative splicing. The insertion encodes FPCVSF-stop; thus the mRNA is predicted to generate a C-terminal truncation. Given the possible oncogenic properties of truncated eIF3-p48 (Int-6) (see below), the frequency of occurrence of this insertion was determined. The 21-bp insertion was found in only 1 of 26 ESTs encoding that region of human eIF3-p48 and therefore may be a unique or very rare event. To investigate the occurrence of the alternative splice/insertion event in human cells, two independent cDNA libraries from 8 different tissues were analyzed by PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Whereas no larger PCR product indicative of the 21-bp insertion was detected in any of the primary amplification reactions (Fig. 2, upper panel), when a nested PCR analysis was performed by using a primer corresponding to the insert sequence, 7 of the 16 libraries representing 5 different tissues generated a band indicative of the insert (Fig. 2, lower panel). Thus the putative alternative splice/insertion event occurs widely but at such a low frequency that the resulting truncated protein likely would not affect cell physiology. To demonstrate that the cloned human int-6 DNA sequence actually encodes the p48 subunit of eIF3, a full-length cDNA was generated by PCR amplification of a human liver cDNA library (Stratagene), and the product was cloned under control of the T7 promoter to generate pTZp48, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pTZp48 insert was sequenced to confirm the sequence reported here (accession numberU54562), and eIF3-p48 was expressed in an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The largest and most abundant of the three 35S-labeled products comigrates precisely with the p48 subunit of purified eIF3 when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 b). The minor, lower molecular weight products presumably are partially degraded forms of p48. Further evidence that pTZp48 encodes a subunit of eIF3 was obtained by immunoprecipitation of the eIF3 complex present in thein vitro translation reaction. Labeled p48 and its degraded forms are detected in precipitates obtained with crude anti-eIF3 antiserum (Fig. 3 c), even though eIF3-p48 is not directly recognized by this antiserum (13Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 14Milburn S.C. Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates formed with affinity-purified antibodies specific for the p170 subunit of eIF3 also contain the recombinant eIF3-p48, but that with preimmune serum does not (Fig. 3 c). Apparently, newly synthesized p48 exchanges inefficiently into endogenous eIF3 complexes, leading to its coprecipitation. Evidence that the cDNA described here encodes eIF3-p48 includes matches to three peptide sequences derived from a 48-kDa protein in purified eIF3, co-migration of the recombinant protein with the 48-kDa subunit, and co-immunoprecipitation with anti-eIF3 and anti-p170 antibodies. eIF3-p48 itself appears not to be very antigenic, because the eIF3 antiserum does not recognize the p48 subunit. This lack of antigenicity and the comigration of the p48 and p47 subunits of eIF3 during routine SDS-PAGE resulted in a failure in earlier work to distinguish the two subunits, which together were called eIF3-p47 (13Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4206-4212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,14Milburn S.C. Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the p48 and p47 subunits are distinctly different proteins, as shown conclusively by the cloning of the p48 cDNA described here, as well as the cloning and sequencing of a cDNA encoding eIF3-p47. 2K. Asano, H.-P. Vornlocher, N. J. Richter-Cook, W. C. Merrick, A. G. Hinnebusch, and J. W. B. Hershey, submitted for publication. The situation is similar to that of the p116 and p110 subunits, which also were not separated during SDS-PAGE and were identified earlier as a single 115-kDa band (14Milburn S.C. Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus the cloning and sequencing of cDNAs for eIF3 subunits has led to a refinement of our knowledge of the composition of this complex factor. That eIF3-p48 is encoded by the int-6 gene is intriguing and requires further examination. MMTV genomes integrate into mouse genomes at a number of different sites, thereby causing deregulation of the expression of adjacent genes in mammary tumors (15Varmus H.E. Cancer Surv. 1982; 1: 309-320Google Scholar). One of these sites, called int-6, was identified in a mammary hyperplastic outgrowth cell line obtained from a feral mouse as well as in two other independent mammary tumors (10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Gallahan M.S.D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Murine int-6comprises 13 exons that encode a protein known to be highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed. Insertion of the MMTV genome intoint-6 may result in the expression of a truncated protein that either is activated or functions as a dominant-negative mutant form (10Marchetti A. Buttitta F. Gallahan M.S.D. Smith G.H. Callahan R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus truncated eIF3-p48 (Int-6) may be a dominant-negative oncoprotein. However, a truncated Int-6 protein has not yet been demonstrated experimentally in the MMTV tumor cells, and other possible mechanisms of mutagenesis are possible, such as altered expression of other genes near to int-6. Int-6 also has been identified recently as binding to the human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax protein (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is proposed that binding of Tax relocates Int-6 from the nucleus to the cytosol. If truncated eIF3-p48 indeed is generated and functions as an oncoprotein, how might it be involved in malignancy? A number of components of the translational apparatus have been implicated in regulation of cell proliferation (2Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Overexpression of the cDNA encoding eIF4E causes malignant transformation of NIH 3T3 and rat L1 cells (16Lazaris-Karatzas A. Montine K.S. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1990; 345: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and abberant growth in HeLa cells (17De Benedetti A. Rhoads R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8212-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The increased level of eIF4E apparently exceeds the level of the 4E-BPs that are responsible for inhibiting the activity of this initiation factor, resulting in uncontrolled activation of protein synthesis (2Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 245-269Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative form of the eIF2α kinase, PKR, also causes malignant transformation (18Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), presumably by preventing the down-regulation of protein synthesis through phosphorylation of eIF2α. This view is reinforced by the demonstration that overexpression of the Ser51 → Ala mutant form of eIF2α, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKR, also deregulates cell growth (19Donzé O. Jagus R. Koromilas A.E. Hershey J.W.B. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3828-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, loss of proliferation control appears to involve the cell's failure to repress translation. It is therefore perplexing how truncated forms of eIF3-p48 might lead to deregulation of cell growth. Large C-terminal deletions often lead to loss of function, which in the case of an eIF3 subunit would be expected to result in an inhibition of protein synthesis. However, it is possible that p48 is not part of the active core of mammalian eIF3, inasmuch as no homolog is found in yeast eIF3. Rather, we speculate that it might function as a regulatory subunit involved in down-regulating eIF3 activity. Therefore, disruption of eIF3-p48 could result in loss of repression of eIF3 activity and thus of protein synthesis. Similarly, Tax localized in the cytosol of human T-cell leukemia virus type I-infected cells (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) might bind to eIF3-p48 (Int-6) and remove it from eIF3, resulting in deregulation of protein synthesis. A second interesting possibility is that eIF3-p48 plays two roles in cells, one as a subunit of eIF3 and another as a regulator of cell growth together with the promyelocytic leukemia protein as previously proposed (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). If this is the case, the fate of a cell might be determined by the dynamic distribution of the bifunctional protein, stimulating either differentiation (nucleus) or cell growth (cytosol). The nuclear localization of eIF3-p48 (Int-6) is surprising (11Desbois C. Rousset R. Bantignies F. Jalinot P. Science. 1996; 273: 951-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, nuclear localization of an initiation factor has a precedence in eIF4E whose antibodies predominantly immunostain the nucleus (20Lejbkowicz F. Goyer C. Dareveu A. Neron S. Lemieux R. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9612-9616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Experiments are in progress to investigate the function of the truncated or Tax-bound p48 subunit of eIF3 in protein synthesis and cell growth. We thank Joachim Schnier for providing purified FM3A mRNA, Nancy Richter-Cook for assistance in peptide sequencing and Jim Anderson, Tom Dever, and Alan Hinnebusch for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1997032548,"Persistent Na+currents are thought to be important for integration of neuronal responses. Here, we show that βγ subunits of G proteins can induce persistent Na+ currents. Coexpression of Gβ2γ3, Gβ1γ3, or Gβ5γ3, but not Gβ1γ1 subunits with rat brain type IIA Na+ channel α subunits in tsA-201 cells greatly enhances a component of Na+ current with a normal voltage dependence of activation but with dramatically slowed and incomplete inactivation and with steady-state inactivation shifted +37 mV. Synthetic peptides containing the proposed Gβγ-binding motif, Gln-X-X-Glu-Arg, from either adenylyl cyclase 2 or the Na+ channel α subunit C-terminal domain reversed the effect of Gβ2γ3 subunits. These results are consistent with direct binding of Gβγ subunits to the C-terminal domain of the Na+ channel, stabilizing a gating mode responsible for slowed and persistent Na+ current. Modulation of Na+ channel gating by Gβγ subunits is expected to have profound effects on neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2123669567,"The significance of functional maps for cortical plasticity was investigated by imaging of intrinsic optical signals together with single-unit recording in kittens. After even a brief period of monocular deprivation during the height of the critical period, only isolated patches of visual cortex continued to respond strongly to the closed eye. These deprived-eye patches were located on the pinwheel center singularities of the orientation map and consisted of neurons that were poorly selective for stimulus orientation. Neurons in regions surrounding the deprived-eye patches responded only weakly to the deprived eye but were well tuned for the same stimulus orientation that optimally excited them when presented to the open, nondeprived eye. The coincidence of deprived-eye patches with pinwheel center singularities, and the selective loss of orientation tuning within the deprived-eye patches, indicate that the orientation and ocular dominance maps are functionally linked and provide compelling evidence that pinwheel center singularities are important for cortical plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1969540269,"We have examined domain interactions in the rod cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel using both physiological and biochemical interaction assays. We have found an interaction between two regions of the channel distant in primary structure, the amino-terminal region and the carboxyl-terminal region containing the cyclic nucleotide-binding (CNB) domain. The interaction in functional channels was detected by the formation of a disulfide bond between cysteine residues at position 35 in the amino-terminal region and 481 in the carboxyl-terminal region. The disulfide bond resulted in channel potentiation, which was due, in part, to an increase in availability of C481 to modification when the channels were open. This state dependence is likely to underlie previously reported potentiation of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels by sulfhydryl-reactive compounds. Polypeptides derived from the amino- terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions were shown to interact, even under conditions which precluded disulfide bond formation. These data argue for a previously unknown, direct interaction between disparate regions of channel sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1982879998,"We have characterized the organization and expression of odorant receptor genes clustered within ∼100 kb of the zebrafish genome. Physical analysis of this genomic region reveals that the receptor genes are tightly linked in tandem arrays. The expression patterns of these genes were evaluated during development as well as in the adult olfactory epithelium. Highly related genes from this array are expressed individually in different olfactory neurons, suggesting that the discriminatory capacity of the vertebrate olfactory system has been maximized by segregating the most similar receptors into distinct cellular pathways. Furthermore, genes from this cluster are activated at different times of development. Together, these results indicate that genomically linked odorant receptor genes are not coordinately regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2000941559,"The role of cGMP in olfactory signaling is not fully understood, but it is believed to play a modulatory role in intracellular signaling in vertebrate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Here, we present evidence that cGMP in ORNs may play an important role in recognition of biologically relevant odors and olfactory learning. Specifically, we investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying olfactory imprinting in salmon. Salmon learn odors associated with their natal site as juveniles and later use these odors to guide their homing migration. This imprinting is believed to involve sensitization of the peripheral olfactory system to specific homestream odorants. We imprinted juvenile salmon to the odorant beta-phenylethyl alcohol (PEA) and examined the sensitivity of olfactory adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases to PEA during development. Stimulation of guanylyl cyclase activity by PEA was significantly greater in olfactory cilia isolated from PEA-imprinted salmon compared with PEA-naive fish only at the time of the homing migration, 2 years after PEA exposure. These results suggest that sensitization of olfactory guanylyl cyclase may play an important role in olfactory imprinting by salmon."

https://openalex.org/W1975443643,"1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) stimulates the formation of both diglyceride and ceramide in the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 (Strum, J. C., Small, G. W., Pauig, S. B., and Daniel, L. W. (1994)J. Biol. Chem 269, 15493–15497). ara-C also causes apoptosis in HL-60 cells which can be mimicked by exogenous ceramide. However, the signaling role for ara-C-induced diacylglycerol (DAG) is not defined. We found that Bcl-2 levels were increased by treatment of HL-60 cells with exogenous DAG or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In contrast, exogenous ceramide treatment caused a decrease in cellular Bcl-2 levels. Thus, ara-C stimulates the synthesis of two second messengers with opposing effects on Bcl-2. Since the effects of ara-C-induced DAG could be due to protein kinase C (PKC) activation, we determined the effects of ara-C on PKC isozymes. ara-C caused an increase in membrane-bound PKCβII (but not PKCα or PKCδ). ara-C or TPA-induced translocation of PKCβII was inhibited by 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3), and ara-C-induced apoptosis was stimulated by pretreatment of the cells with ET-18-OCH3. ET-18-OCH3 also inhibited stimulation of Bcl-2 by TPA and enhanced the decrease in Bcl-2 observed in ara-C-treated cells. These data indicate that ara-C-induced apoptosis is limited by ara-C-stimulated PKCβII through effects on Bcl-2. To further determine the role of PKC, we used antisense oligonucleotides directed toward PKCβII. The antisense, but not the sense, oligonucleotide inhibited PKCβII activation and enhanced ara-C-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that the stimulation of apoptosis by ara-C is self-limiting and can be enhanced by inhibition of PKC. 1-β-d-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) stimulates the formation of both diglyceride and ceramide in the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 (Strum, J. C., Small, G. W., Pauig, S. B., and Daniel, L. W. (1994)J. Biol. Chem 269, 15493–15497). ara-C also causes apoptosis in HL-60 cells which can be mimicked by exogenous ceramide.

However, it is also evident that ara-C has additional effects. For example the rapidity of cell killing observed within 24–36 h of drug administration is inconsistent with the long duration of the DNA synthesis phase in human leukemia cells (>48 h) (1Kucera G.L. Capizzi R.L. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3886-3891PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although ara-C is the most effective single agent in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, the mechanism of leukemic cell death in response to ara-C is not well defined. We have previously shown that ara-C stimulates the synthesis of two lipid second messengers, diglyceride and ceramide (2Strum J.C. Small G.W. Pauig S.B. Daniel L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15493-15497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kharbanda et al. (3Kharbanda S. Emoto Y. Kisaki H. Saleem A. Kufe D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 67-72PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that ara-C induces a protein kinase C-like activity in HL-60 cells. Thus, the ara-C-induced DAG could exert its biological activities through the activation of PKC. Ceramide is also recognized as a second messenger, and there is evidence that PKC activation is antagonistic to ceramide-induced apoptosis (4Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S.

Therefore, ara-C induces two lipid mediators that are potentially involved in opposing pathways in HL-60 cells with respect to induction of cell death by apoptosis. To test this idea we studied DAG-activated signaling in response to ara-C using ET-18-OCH3, a member of a class of membrane-interactive drugs selective for growth inhibition of cancer cells (7Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R. Cancer Chemotherapy. Blackwell, Oxford1991: 2-57Google Scholar, 8Lohmeyer M. Bittman R. Drugs Future. 1994; 19: 1021-1037Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 9Principe P. Sidoti C. Braquet P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2509-2515PubMed Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 directly inhibits PKC activity in vitro by acting as a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphatidylserine, a lipid cofactor required by PKC (7Daniel L.W. Hickman J.A. Tritton T.R.

Our results demonstrate that inhibition of PKCβII by either ET-18-OCH3 or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to PKCβII enhances ara-C-induced apoptosis. This suggests that the diacylglycerol formed in response to ara-C is activating a signaling pathway that is antagonistic to ara-C-stimulated apoptosis. ara-C (Upjohn) was dissolved in sterile deionized water. TPA was purchased from LC Services and stored in dimethyl sulfoxide. ET-18-OCH3 (Medmark Pharma, GmbH, Grunwald, Germany) and C2-ceramide (Matreya) were stored in 100% ethanol. Stock preparations of all reagents were stored at −20 °C under light-free conditions. Vehicle controls were included and were consistently found to be without effect on the parameters studied. Monoclonal PKCβII and PKCδ antibodies (Dr. David Burns, Sphinx Pharmaceuticals), polyclonal PKCα (UBI), and monoclonal antibody to Bcl-2α (Pharmingen) were stored at −20 °C and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, supplemented with 3% bovine serum albumin prior to use. In some experiments, monoclonal PKCβ antibodies (Signal Transduction Laboratories) were used since HL-60 cells do not have PKCβI (13Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were purchased from ATCC and used between passage numbers 29 and 65. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2, were passaged three times per week at 2 × 105 cells/ml, and exhibited a doubling time of approximately 30 h. Cell number and viability were determined using a hemocytometer and trypan blue exclusion assay. HL-60 cells were suspended at a density of 2 × 105cells/ml and incubated 18–24 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of exogenous compounds. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as reported previously (14Ray S. Ponnathpur V. Huang Y. Tang C. Mahoney M.E. Ibrado A.M. Bullock G. Bhalla K. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1994; 34: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, HL-60 cells (0.5–1 × 106) were treated with various agents, and following treatment, cells were washed twice in serum-free media and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 40 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% SDS) containing 200 ng/μl RNase A and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The lysate was diluted to 300 μl in the same buffer but containing 225 ng/μl Proteinase K (Sigma) and incubated for 16 h at 50 °C. Total genomic DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer, pH 8.0. Equal amounts of DNA were loaded into wells of a 1.5% (Seakem GTG, FMC) agarose gel (3 mm thick), and DNA fragments were resolved by electrophoresis at 115 V for 90 min in Tris:borate:EDTA buffer. A 123-base pair DNA molecular weight reference (Promega) was run in parallel. After electrophoresis, the DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide and exposure to UV light. For quantitation of small molecular weight DNA, HL-60 cells (5 × 106) were exposed for 6 h to drugs and then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant were removed, adjusted to 5 mm Tris, 15 mm EGTA, 15 mm EDTA, and assayed for released DNA fragments as described below. The remaining medium was aspirated, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mm Tris, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (100 μl/106 cells). Cell lysates and medium samples were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to separate fragmented DNA (supernatant) from intact DNA (pellet). The lysate and medium samples were diluted in TNE (10 mm Tris, 3 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 1 μg/ml Hoescht reagent 33528 (Sigma). Relative DNA amounts were determined by spectrofluorophotometry with excitation at 365 (100-nm bandwidth) and filtered emission at 460 nm (10-nm bandwidth). A sucrose gradient (11:15:40 (w/v) in a 2:1:1 ratio) was used to fractionate cytosol and membranes (15Caldwell S.E. McCall C.E. Hendricks C.L. Leone P.A. Bass D.A. McPhail L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1485-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and cell pellets (108 cells) were resuspended in 800 μl of an 11% sucrose solution containing 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and sodium vanadate. Sonicates were layered over 15% and 40% gradients (supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and vanadate) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The top 700 μl contained cytosolic proteins, and the interface between the 15% and 40% sucrose layers contained the membrane proteins. Protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA protein assay reagent, and the cytosolic and membrane fractions were diluted to equal protein concentrations with sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 0.05m dithiothreitol, 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8). After boiling and dilution in glycerol/bromphenol blue solution, equal amounts of protein were loaded into the wells of 9% (for PKC) or 12% (for Bcl-2α) SDS-polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to confirm equal loading of protein. Immunoblotting was performed and proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescent assay (NEN Life Science Products). Scanning densitometry was performed, and relative protein amounts were measured by the Macintosh software program IPLab Gel. Unprotected antisense and sense oligodeoxynucleotides to PKCβII were synthesized by the DNA core laboratory of the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Bowman Gray School of Medicine of Wake Forest University. The 5′ region of human PKCβII was targeted and had the following 25-mer sequence: 5′-CCCCGCAGCCGGGTCAGCCATCTTG-3′. The complementary sequence over the same region was used to synthesize sense oligonucleotides to PKCβII: 5′-CAAGATGGCTGACCCGGCTGCGGGG-3′. The purified oligonucleotides were stored at −20 °C. To minimize the action of nucleases, the oligonucleotides were added at a final concentration of 15 μm to cells in serum-free RPMI (supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin/transferrin). The cultures (2 × 105cells/ml) were allowed to equilibrate at 37 °C for 24 h prior to the addition of drugs. Isoforms of PKC appear to have different targets in signaling pathways of specific cell types, and this can lead to diverse cellular responses (16Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y.

Calcium- and phospholipid-dependent PKCβII has been demonstrated to be important in a signaling pathway resulting in TPA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to monocytes and adherent macrophages (23Macfarlane D.E.

In in vitro assays, ET-18-OCH3inhibits total PKC activity induced by TPA, as well as TPA-stimulated activity of the partially purified PKCβII isoform. 2G. W. Small and L. W. Daniel, unpublished data. To determine the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on specific PKC isoforms, we used immunoblot analysis to evaluate translocation from cytosol to membranes, an indicator of PKC activation by TPA. Fig.1 shows that the majority of PKCβII is in the cytosol of unstimulated HL-60 cells. A 1-h treatment with 100 nm TPA induced translocation of this isoform. Simultaneously, we examined the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on PKCβII in unstimulated and TPA-treated cells. The TPA-stimulated translocation of PKCβII is inhibited by pretreatment of HL-60 cells for 16 h with 4 μm ET-18-OCH3. Under these experimental conditions, ET-18-OCH3 also caused an observable decrease of PKCβII in the membranes of non-stimulated cells treated while in log phase growth. Kharbanda et al. (27Kharbanda S. Datta R. Kufe D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7947-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) demonstrated a time-dependent increase in a serine/threonine kinase activity in HL-60 cells treated with 10 μm ara-C. Therefore, the 2-fold increase in the DAG subclass in response to ara-C could activate one or more DAG-binding PKC isoforms (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). We found that PKCα was not significantly translocated during ara-C (10 μm) exposure (0–9 h) of HL-60 cells (data not shown). Cytosolic and membrane levels of Ca2+-independent PKCδ (data not shown) were also not affected by ara-C. However, PKCβII levels increased in the membranes isolated from cells treated with 10 μm ara-C (Fig.2 A). Examination of total PKCβII by immunoblot analysis demonstrated that ara-C stimulates PKCβII up-regulation (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). A maximal increase was consistently observed at approximately 3–5 h, but levels were above the unstimulated control for up to 9 h. ET-18-OCH3 (2 μm) inhibited the effect of ara-C on membrane-associated levels of PKCβII (Fig. 2) over the time period studied. The loss of viability in the cells treated with the combination of drugs was greater than that observed with ET-18-OCH3 or ara-C alone. This was observed in cells treated for up to 24 h with 10 μm ara-C and 0.5–2.0 μm ET-18-OCH3. Inhibition of colony formation by ara-C was enhanced by co-treatment with ET-18-OCH3 (data not shown). These data prompted an investigation of the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on ara-C-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. One marker for apoptosis is the presence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation observed as a DNA ladder in multiples of 180–200 base pairs in an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. We observed a dose-dependent increase in the levels of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in HL-60 cells treated with ara-C (0.1–10 μm for 8 h). ET-18-OCH3 at the concentrations we used (0.1–2.0 μm) did not result in significant DNA cleavage (Fig. 3). However, at higher concentrations ET-18-OCH3 alone can cause apoptosis (29Surette M.E. Winkler J.D. Fonteh A.N. Chilton F.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9187-9196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Mollinedo F. Martinez-Dalmau R. Modolell M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

HL-60 cells treated with 10 μmara-C and ET-18-OCH3 (0.5–2 μm) showed a marked dose-dependent increase in DNA cleavage compared with ara-C alone (Fig. 3). Enhancement of DNA cleavage was also observed with low concentrations of ara-C (0.1 μm) in the presence of 0.1 μm ET-18-OCH3 at 16 h (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that ara-C-induced apoptosis is suppressed by the activation of PKCβII. C2-ceramide causes apoptosis without activation of PKCβII, and ET-18-OCH3 did not further stimulate C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). Bcl-2α is a member of a recently discovered family of proteins that are regulators of apoptosis (33Chinnaiyan A.M. Orth K. O'Rourke K. Duan H. Poirier G.G. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4573-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 34Delia D. Aiello A. Soligo D. Fontanella E. Melani C. Pezzella F. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 399-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Bcl-2α, a 25–26-kDa phosphoprotein, functions to suppress apoptosis. ara-C treatment induces transcriptional down-regulation of Bcl-2α in HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis (34Delia D. Aiello A. Soligo D. Fontanella E. Melani C. Pezzella F. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Blood. 1992; 79: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of Bcl-2α with antisense oligonucleotides induces apoptosis and sensitizes leukemic cells to ara-C (38Keith F.J. Bradbury D.A. Zhu Y.-M. Russell N.H. Leukemia. 1995; 9: 131-138PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated that cell-permeable ceramide analogs transcriptionally down-regulate Bcl-2α (39Chen M. Quintans J. Fuks Z. Thompson C. Kufe D.W. Weichselbaum R.R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 991-994PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effect of ET-18-OCH3 on Bcl-2α protein levels in HL-60 cells treated with ara-C, TPA, or C2-ceramide. Fig.4 illustrates the effects of TPA (10 nm), ara-C (10 μm), and C2-ceramide (100 μm) on Bcl-2α levels in HL-60 cells. TPA caused a time-dependent increase in Bcl-2α while C2-ceramide caused a marked reduction in Bcl-2α. ara-C caused only a moderate decrease in Bcl-2. Therefore, the failure of ara-C to cause a marked reduction in Bcl-2 could be due to the simultaneous stimulation of PKC. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with ET-18-OCH3 caused a reduction in Bcl-2α levels in both ara-C-treated (Fig. 5) and TPA-treated cells (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). ET-18-OCH3 alone did not significantly affect Bcl-2α levels (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis. Ph.D. dissertation, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC.Google Scholar). Pretreating HL-60 cells with ET-18-OCH3 did not have an effect on the reduction of Bcl-2α levels in response to ceramide which did not cause PKCβII translocation (28Whitman, S. P. (1996) Diacylglycerol and Ceramide in ara-C Stimulated HL-60 Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis.

Therefore, to provide further evidence that inhibition of PKCβII activity is an important event we examined the effect of oligonucleotides to PKCβII mRNA on ara-C-induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. HL-60 cells in serum-free media were pretreated with or without antisense or sense oligonucleotides to PKCβII for 24 h, followed by addition of 10 μm ara-C. Serum-free conditions were used to minimize nuclease activity. This pretreatment was without significant effect on the growth of control, HL-60 cells not treated with ara-C (data not shown). Pretreatment with the antisense (but not sense) oligonucleotides inhibited ara-C-stimulated increases in PKCβII (Fig.6 A). Inhibiting PKCβII with antisense oligonucleotides also enhanced ara-C-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 B). Treatment with either antisense or sense oligonucleotides for a total of 30 h did not result in significant DNA fragmentation above the level observed in untreated HL-60 cells (Fig. 6 B). In summary, the data presented indicate that the ara-C-stimulated formation of DAG and ceramide lead to activation of two antagonistic signaling pathways. The protective effects of the PKCβII-dependent pathway are due to effects on the levels of Bcl-2. Inhibition of the PKCβII-dependent pathway results in an enhancement of apoptosis in response to ara-C. Overall, these data indicate that inhibition of PKC may enhance the clinical effectiveness of ara-C and point to strategies for the use of chemotherapeutic agents in new combinations.

The expression of CAT in pMyc2CAT-transformed cells declined fivefold after 24 h in the presence of RA, returned to the normal level within 48 h, and decreased again to below 20% of the normal level after 96 h. By contrast, the expression of CAT in pMyc1CAT-transformed cells did not return to the normal level after 48 h in the presence of RA. In addition, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with ME1a1 DNA as probe demonstrated that the kinetics of the DNA-binding activity of MAZ were closely correlated with the changes in the expression of CAT from the c-myc promoter/CAT gene during the differentiation of P19EC cells. Taken together, these results suggest that MAZ plays a key role in the transient increase in the expression of the c-myc gene after 48 h of exposure to RA during the neuroectodermal differentiation of P19EC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970098640,"The control of cell cycle progression is necessary for accuracy in the replication of DNA and the distribution of genetic information to daughter cells. Disturbances in progression of the cell cycle may result in the loss of genomic integrity, a `hallmark' of cancer cells. Extensive consumption of alcoholic beverages is a risk factor associated with the development of various human epidermoid cancer including oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. However, effects of ethanol on cell cycle progression and on the expression of genes associated with the cell cycle have not been studied. We report here that exposure of human epithelial cells to ethanol, at concentrations (100 – 200 mM) that do not cause cell death, (a) does not affect or only reduces slightly the cellular level of p53 protein, (b) upregulates the transcription of the WAF1/CIP1 gene, (c) inhibits the Cdk2 activity, and (d) reduces the rate of cellular proliferation by inducing a delay in G1 phase transition. The results also indicate that, at these non-cytotoxic concentrations, ethanol exhibits its effects through a p53-independent mechanism."

The resulting fusion gene encodes a chimeric protein which has aberrant transcriptional activity. We report the molecular definition of the genomic breakpoints on both derivative chromosomes in one case and the derivative chromosome 13 breakpoints in two other cases. The DNA sequences adjacent to the breakpoints on the derivative chromosome 13 are remarkable for their resemblance to recognition sequences for the protein translin. Gel shift analyses confirm that these sequences bind translin. These findings suggest that translin may not only be important in the genesis of chromosomal translocations in lymphoid malignancy, but also in translocations found in solid tumours."

RACT is activated by Ca2+ release but not by Ca2+ entry and serves to selectively refill Ca2+ stores after release. RACT lowers cytosolic [Ca2+] with a rate constant about 1.6 times that of the SERCA pump with empty ER. RACT is thapsigargin-insensitive, was eliminated by ryanodine, but was not affected by blocking mitochondrial or plasma membrane Ca2+ transport. A Ca2+ flux model with RACT in the ER membrane reproduced the cytosolic and store [Ca2+] responses to all stimuli."
