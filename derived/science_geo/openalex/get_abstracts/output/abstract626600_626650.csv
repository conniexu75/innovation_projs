https://openalex.org/W2911758278,"In hospitalized patients, the risk of sepsis-related mortality can be assessed using the quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA). Currently, different tools that predict deterioration such as the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) have been introduced in clinical practice in Emergency Departments (ED) worldwide. It remains ambiguous which screening tool for mortality at the ED is best. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive performance for mortality of two sepsis-based scores (i.e. qSOFA and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)-criteria) compared to the more general NEWS score, in patients with suspected infection directly at presentation to the ED.We performed a retrospective cohort study. Patients who presented to the ED between June 2012 and May 2016 with suspected sepsis in a large tertiary care center were included. Suspected sepsis was defined as initiation of intravenous antibiotics and/or collection of any culture in the ED. Outcome was defined as 10-day and 30-day mortality after ED presentation. Predictive performance was expressed as discrimination (AUC) and calibration using Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Subsequently, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.In total 8,204 patients were included of whom 286 (3.5%) died within ten days and 490 (6.0%) within 30 days after presentation. NEWS had the best performance, followed by qSOFA and SIRS (10-day AUC: 0.837, 0.744, 0.646, 30-day AUC: 0.779, 0.697, 0.631). qSOFA (≥2) lacked a high sensitivity versus SIRS (≥2) and NEWS (≥7) (28.5%, 77.2%, 68.0%), whilst entailing highest specificity versus NEWS and SIRS (93.7%, 66.5%, 37.6%).NEWS is more accurate in predicting 10- and 30-day mortality than qSOFA and SIRS in patients presenting to the ED with suspected sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2914842667,"Routine health information systems are critical for monitoring service delivery. District Heath Information System, version 2 (DHIS2) is an open source software platform used in more than 60 countries, on which global initiatives increasingly rely for such monitoring. We used facility-reported data in DHIS2 for Gombe State, north-eastern Nigeria, to present a case study of data quality to monitor priority maternal and neonatal health indicators.For all health facilities in DHIS2 offering antenatal and postnatal care services (n = 497) and labor and delivery services (n = 486), we assessed the quality of data for July 2016-June 2017 according to the World Health Organization data quality review guidance. Using data from DHIS2 as well as external facility-level and population-level household surveys, we reviewed three data quality dimensions-completeness and timeliness, internal consistency, and external consistency-and considered the opportunities for improvement.Of 14 priority maternal and neonatal health indicators that could be tracked through facility-based data, 12 were included in Gombe's DHIS2. During July 2016-June 2017, facility-reported data in DHIS2 were incomplete at least 40% of the time, under-reported 10%-60% of the events documented in facility registers, and showed inconsistencies over time, between related indicators, and with an external data source. The best quality data elements were those that aligned with Gombe's health program priorities, particularly older health programs, and those that reflected contact indicators rather than indicators related to the provision of commodities or content of care.This case study from Gombe State, Nigeria, demonstrates the high potential for effective monitoring of maternal and neonatal health using DHIS2. However, coordinated action at multiple levels of the health system is needed to maximize reporting of existing data; rationalize data flow; routinize data quality review, feedback, and supervision; and ensure ongoing maintenance of DHIS2."
https://openalex.org/W2912899818,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and leading cause of premature death globally. In 2008, approximately 40% of adults were diagnosed with hypertension, with more than 1.5 billion people estimated to be affected globally by 2025. Hypertension disproportionally affects low- and middle-income countries, where the prevalence is higher and where the health systems are more fragile. This qualitative study explored patients’ experiences on the management and control of hypertension in rural Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. We conducted sixty semi-structured interviews, with 20 participants in each country. Hypertensive individuals were recruited based on age, gender and hypertensive status. Overall, patients’ reported symptoms across the three countries were quite similar, although perceptions of hypertension were mixed. The majority of patients reported low knowledge on how to prevent or treat hypertension. The main barriers to accessing health services, as reported by participants, were inadequate services and poor quality of existing facilities, shortage of medicine supplies, busyness of doctors due to high patient load, long travel distance to facilities, and long waiting times once facilities were reached. Patients also mentioned that cost was a barrier to accessing services and adhering to medication. Many patients, when asked for areas of improvement, reported on the importance of the provider-patient relationship and mentioned valuing doctors who spent time with them, provided advice, and could be trusted. However, most patients reported that, especially at primary health care level and in government hospitals, the experience with their doctor did not meet their expectations. Patients in the three countries reported desire for good quality local medical services, the need for access to doctors, medicine and diagnostics and decreased cost for medication and medical services. Patients also described welcoming health care outreach activities near their homes. Areas of improvement could focus on reorienting community health workers’ activities; involving family members in comprehensive counseling for medication adherence; providing appropriate training for health care staff to deliver effective information and services for controlling hypertension to patients; enhancing primary health care and specialist services; improving supplies of hypertensive medication in public facilities; taking into account patients’ cultural and social background when providing services; and facilitating access and treatment to those who are most vulnerable."
https://openalex.org/W2914205477,"Background Injured patients are at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to describe the incidence, timing, and severity of AKI in a large trauma population, identify risk factors for AKI, and report mortality outcomes. Methods A prospective observational study of injured adults, who met local criteria for trauma team activation, and were admitted to a UK Major Trauma Centre. AKI was defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to analyse parameters associated with AKI and mortality. Results Of the 1410 patients enrolled in the study, 178 (12.6%) developed AKI. Age; injury severity score (ISS); admission systolic blood pressure, lactate and serum creatinine; units of Packed Red Blood Cells transfused in first 24 hours and administration of nephrotoxic therapy were identified as independent risk factors for the development of AKI. Patients that developed AKI had significantly higher mortality than those with normal renal function (47/178 [26.4%] versus 128/1232 [10.4%]; OR 3.09 [2.12 to 4.53]; p<0.0001). After adjusting for other clinical prognostic factors, AKI was an independent risk factor for mortality. Conclusions AKI is a frequent complication following trauma and is associated with prolonged hospital length of stay and increased mortality. Future research is needed to improve our ability to rapidly identify those at risk of AKI, and develop resuscitation strategies that preserve renal function in trauma patients."
https://openalex.org/W2911416421,"Given the increasing lifespan of the elderly and the higher proportion of older people in the global population, the incidence rate of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing. The aim of this study is to evaluate, by means of computer simulations, developments in the costs of treating and caring for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the EU 28 by 2080, while assuming the introduction of drug administrations at various disease stages.Impact analysis leverages a mathematical model that compares five different population development scenarios when introducing different types of drugs to the scenarios but without changing the treatment. Changes in the economic burden are considered as of 2023, when new drugs are expected to enter the market.The results of the simulations show that by prolonging the length of a person's 'stay' in the Mild, Moderate, or Severe stage, the total cost of care for all persons with AD will increase by 2080. For individual scenarios, the percentage of patients and costs increased as follows: Mild by one year, by 10.61%; Mild by two years, by 17.73%; Moderate by one year, by 16.79%; Moderate by two years, by 34.88%; and Severe by one year, by 23.79%. The change in cost development when prolonging the stay in the Mild cognitive impairment stage (by lowering the incidence by 10%, 30%, or 50%) reduced the cost (by 4.88%, 16.78% and 32.48%, respectively).The results unambiguously show that any intervention prolonging a patient's stay in any stage will incur additional care costs and an increase in the number of persons with AD. Therefore, extending lifespan is important in terms of improving the quality of life of patients, and the introduction of new drugs must consider the additional costs imposed upon society."
https://openalex.org/W2914763394,"To cause infection, Salmonella must survive and replicate in host niches that present dramatically different environmental conditions. This requires a flexible metabolism and physiology, responsive to conditions of the local milieu. The sequence specific RNA binding protein CsrA serves as a global regulator that governs gene expression required for pathogenicity, metabolism, biofilm formation, and motility in response to nutritional conditions. Its activity is determined by two noncoding small RNAs (sRNA), CsrB and CsrC, which sequester and antagonize this protein. Here, we used ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis to comprehensively examine the effects of CsrA on mRNA occupancy with ribosomes, a measure of translation, transcript stability, and the steady state levels of transcripts under in vitro SPI-1 inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the intestinal lumen, and under in vitro SPI-2-inducing conditions, to simulate growth in the Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) of the macrophage. Our findings uncovered new roles for CsrA in controlling the expression of structural and regulatory genes involved in stress responses, metabolism, and virulence systems required for infection. We observed substantial variation in the CsrA regulon under the two growth conditions. In addition, CsrB/C sRNA levels were greatly reduced under the simulated intracellular conditions and were responsive to nutritional factors that distinguish the intracellular and luminal environments. Altogether, our results reveal CsrA to be a flexible regulator, which is inferred to be intimately involved in maintaining the distinct gene expression patterns associated with growth in the intestine and the macrophage."
https://openalex.org/W2950238408,"Abnormal antagonist leg muscle activity could indicate increased muscle co-contraction and clarify mechanisms of balance impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD). Prior studies in carefully selected patients showed PD patients demonstrate earlier, longer, and larger antagonist muscle activation during reactive balance responses to perturbations.Here, we tested whether antagonist leg muscle activity was abnormal in a group of PD patients who were not selected for phenotype and most of whom had volunteered for exercise-based rehabilitation.We compared antagonist activation during reactive balance responses to multidirectional support-surface translation perturbations in 31 patients with mild-moderate PD (age 68±9; H&Y 1-3; UPDRS-III 32±10) and 13 matched individuals (age 65±9). We quantified modulation of muscle activity (i.e., the ability to activate and inhibit muscles appropriately according to the perturbation direction) using modulation indices (MI) derived from minimum and maximum EMG activation levels observed across perturbation directions.Antagonist leg muscle activity was abnormal in unselected PD patients compared to controls. Linear mixed models identified significant associations between impaired modulation and PD (P<0.05) and PD severity (P<0.01); models assessing the entire sample without referencing PD status identified associations with balance ability (P<0.05), but not age (P = 0.10).Antagonist activity is increased during reactive balance responses in PD patients who are not selected on phenotype and are candidates for exercise-based rehabilitation. This activity may be a mechanism of balance impairment in PD and a potential rehabilitation target or outcome measure."
https://openalex.org/W2913792524,"In contemporary society, it is essential to have adequate mathematical skills. Being numerate has been linked to positive life outcomes and well-being in adults. It is also acknowledged that math anxiety (MA) hampers mathematical skills increasingly with age. Still, the mechanisms by which MA affect performance remain debated. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we contrast the different ways in which MA has been suggested to interfere with math abilities. Our models indicate that MA may affect math performance through three pathways: (1) indirectly through working memory ability, giving support for the ‘affective drop’ hypothesis of MA’s role in mathematical performance, (2) indirectly through symbolic number processing, corroborating the notion of domain-specific mechanisms pertaining to number, and (3) a direct effect of MA on math performance. Importantly, the pathways vary in terms of their relative strength depending on what type of mathematical problems are being solved. These findings shed light on the mechanisms by which MA may interfere with mathematical performance."
https://openalex.org/W2912729099,"Controlling infections shared by wildlife and livestock requires the understanding and quantification of interspecific interactions between the species involved. This is particularly important in extensive multi-host systems, in which controlled domestic animals interact with uncontrolled, abundant and expanding wild species, such as wild ungulates. We have, therefore, quantified the interspecific interactions between wild boar (Sus scrofa) and free-ranging cattle in Mediterranean Spain, along with their spatio-temporal variability. GPS-GSM-collars were used to monitor 12 cows and 14 wild boar in the Doñana National Park between 2011 and 2013. Interactions were defined as encounters between cattle and wild boar within a spatio-temporal window of 52 m and 1 hour. On average, each wild boar interacted with one cow 1.5 ± (SE) 0.5 times per day, while each cow interacted with one wild boar 1.3 ± 0.4 times per day. The frequency of interaction was significantly higher during crepuscular hours owing to the overlap of both species' activity, and also during spring and autumn, probably owing to a higher individual aggregation around shared resources. Finally, the frequency of interaction was higher near the most significant shared resources (e.g. water points) but was lower in areas with dense vegetation. The results presented here show the usefulness of GPS monitoring as regards quantifying interactions and helping to clarify the process of pathogen transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface in Mediterranean Spain, along with the main spatio-temporal risk factors. In a changing scenario in which European populations of wild ungulates are increasing, more efficient measures with which to control interactions are required to meet the demands of farmers and managers. Our results, therefore, provide directional hypotheses that could be used to design disease control programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2914238480,"This paper explores the social inclusiveness of agricultural extension services in India. We estimate the probability and frequency of farmers’ access to extension services and resulting changes in crop income across different caste groups. The literature suggests that caste-based social segregation manifests in various spheres of life, and perpetuates economic inequality and oppression. An econometric analysis of nationally-representative data from rural India verifies this with respect to the agricultural sector. Farmers belonging to the socially-marginalized castes are found to have a lower chance of accessing the public extension services, primarily due to their inferior resource-endowment status. Contacting extension agents at least once increased the average annual crop income by about 12 thousand Indian rupees per household, which is equivalent to 36% of the annual crop income of those without access to extension services. There exists significant impact heterogeneity. Farmers from the socially-marginalized castes hardly benefited from accessing the extension services. Based on these observations, we have developed a number of policy recommendations that could improve the social inclusiveness of agricultural development strategies in rural India."
https://openalex.org/W2914129368,"Tobramycin is commonly used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Tobramycin treatment leads to increased lung function and fewer clinical exacerbations in CF patients, and modestly reduces the density of P. aeruginosa in the lungs. P. aeruginosa resides primarily in the mucus overlying lung epithelial cells and secretes outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that diffuse through the mucus and fuse with airway epithelial cells, thus delivering virulence factors into the cytoplasm that modify the innate immune response. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that Tobramycin reduces the abundance of virulence factors in OMVs secreted by P. aeruginosa. Characterization of the proteome of OMVs isolated from control or Tobramycin-exposed P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 revealed that Tobramycin reduced several OMV-associated virulence determinants, including AprA, an alkaline protease that enhances P. aeruginosa survival in the lung, and is predicted to contribute to the inhibitory effect of P. aeruginosa on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion by primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Deletion of the gene encoding AprA reduced the inhibitory effect of P. aeruginosa on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion. Moreover, as predicted by our proteomic analysis, OMVs isolated from Tobramycin treated P. aeruginosa had a diminished inhibitory effect on Phe508del-CFTR Cl- secretion compared to OMVs isolated from control P. aeruginosa. Taken together, our proteomic analysis of OMVs and biological validation suggest that Tobramycin may improve lung function in CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa by reducing several key virulence factors in OMVs that reduce CFTR Cl- secretion, which is essential for bacterial clearance from the lungs."
https://openalex.org/W2912662639,"To explore the molecular epidemiology of rare deafness genes in Taiwanese sensorineural hearing impairment (SNHI) patients with cochlear implantation (CI) by performing massive parallel sequencing (MPS) and correlating genetic factors and CI outcomes.We enrolled 41 Taiwanese non-syndromic deafness patients with CI that lacked known mutations in common deafness genes. All probands were screened by a targeted exon amplification method that used massively parallel sequencing to screen a customized panel that included 40 relatively rare non-syndromic deafness genes.Thirteen candidate variants in nine relatively rare deafness genes (MYO15A, TMC1, MYH14, MYO3A, ACTG1, COL11A2, DSPP, GRHL2, and WFS1) were identified in 24.4% (10/41) of the non-syndromic deafness probands with CI. According to the ACMG Standards and Guidelines, five variants in MYO15A and ACTG1 were classified as likely pathogenic variants. Two of three multi-generational pedigrees exhibiting deafness were analyzed for the segregation of the disorder with the possible disease-causing variants. Patients with variants detected in most of the identified variant-bearing genes showed relatively good CI outcomes.We successfully identified candidate variants in partially deaf Taiwanese probands who lacked the known mutations in common deafness genes. Comparing the progress of hearing rehabilitation in CI patients with their apparent causative variants and the expression profiles of their altered genes allowed us to speculate on how alterations in specific gene sets may influence outcomes in hearing rehabilitation after CI."
https://openalex.org/W2911339416,"Aim of study To determine the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors in the population of Gaza strip in Palestine. Methods A cross-sectional stratified cluster sample design was applied in this study. A sample of 2240 participant (1121 males and 1119 females) aged ≥25 years participated in the study. For each individual, trained staff administered a questionnaire, where all variables of interest followed WHO’s STEP wise approach to surveillance chronic disease risk factors (STEPS) (WHO, 2001). Sociodemographic data, anthropometric measure (body mass index, blood pressure), and biochemical test (blood sugar and lipids profiles) were measured. Short International Physical Activity (IPAQ) questionnaire form was used. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were used with SPSS (version 22.0) to analyze the data. Results The most common condition was coronary artery disease (8.3%), followed by stroke events (3%). The associated risk factors were obesity (47.8%), hypertension (28.4%), current smoking account for (23.2%), diabetes mellitus (19.1%), high cholesterol level (8.8%), and high triglycerides level (40.2%). Additionally, the proportion of being physical active was found to be low (48.3%); particularly with increasing age. More than 30% of the population has less than 4 days of consumption of fruit and vegetables per week and 65.9% has less than 2 servings per day. Conclusion The burden of CVDs and their associated risk factors is considerable in Gaza and represents a major public health concern. Effective strategies in management, education and healthcare centers are required for an accurate management and implementation of preventive measure in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2911955137,"Plant extracts are a potential source of new compounds for nematode control and may be an excellent alternative for the control gastrointestinal nematodes that are resistant to conventional anthelmintics. However, research involving natural products is a complex process. The main challenge is the identification of bioactive compounds. Online analytical techniques with universal detectors, such as high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), together with metabolomics could enable the fast, accurate evaluation of a massive amount of data, constituting a viable option for the identification of active compounds in plant extracts. This study focused on the evaluation of the ovicidal activity of ethanol extracts from 17 plants collected from the Pantanal wetland in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, against eggs of Haemonchus placei using the egg hatchability test. The ethanol extracts were obtained using accelerated solvent extraction. The data on ovicidal activity, mass spectrometry and metabolomics were evaluated using HPLC-DAD-MS, partial least squares regression analysis (PLS-DA) and a correlation map (univariate correlation analyses) to detect compounds that have a positive correlation with biological activity. Among the ten metabolites with the best correlation coefficients, six were phenylpropanoids, two were triterpene saponins, one was a brevipolide, and one was a flavonoid. Combinations of metabolites with high ovicidal action were also identified, such as phenylpropanoids combined with the triterpene saponins and the flavonoid, flavonoids combined with iridoid and phenylpropanoids, and saponins combined with phenylpropanoid. The positive correlation between classes of compounds in plants belonging to different genera and biological activity (as previously identified in the literature) reinforces the robustness of the statistical data and demonstrates the efficacy of this method for the selection of bioactive compounds without the need for isolation and reevaluation. The proposed method also enables the determination of synergism among the classes, which would be impracticable using traditional methods. The present investigation demonstrates that the metabolomic technique was efficient at detecting secondary metabolites with ovicidal activity against H. placei. Thus, the use of metabolomics can be a tool to accelerate and simplify bioprospecting research with plant extracts in veterinary parasitology."
https://openalex.org/W2914182633,"Objectives This study aimed to retrospectively assess the clinical outcome with nitrofurantoin and pivmecillinam for lower urinary tract infections (UTI) in men. Patients treated with trimethoprim were also included for comparison. Methods All prescriptions of the study antibiotics to adult men in Uppsala County, Sweden, during 2012 were extracted. Data on patient characteristics, therapy, clinical outcome and microbiological results were obtained from the electronic medical records. The relative impact of antibiotic therapy, patient factors and pathogens on clinical outcome was assessed with univariate logistic regression using a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results 832 prescriptions were identified, and 171 patients treated with nitrofurantoin (n = 69), pivmecillinam (n = 57) and trimethoprim (n = 45) met the inclusion criteria. Treatment failure occurred in one patient treated with nitrofurantoin and in four patients treated with pivmecillinam. New prescriptions of UTI antibiotics and relapse within 3 months after completion of therapy were more frequent with nitrofurantoin (34% and 15%) and pivmecillinam (30% and 17%) than trimethoprim (22 and 7%). However, these differences were not statistically significant and substantial heterogeneity was noted between the treatment groups. Urinary tract catheterization was associated with a higher risk for new antibiotic prescriptions (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.14–4.80; P = 0.022) and prostate cancer was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.09–8.29; P = 0.042). Conclusions The clinical outcome with nitrofurantoin and pivmecillinam was acceptable in comparison with the results of previous studies. These antibiotics are suitable for empirical treatment of lower UTI in men considering their high activity against Escherichia coli and limited impact on the intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2912404738,"HIV-1 is the causative agent of AIDS (Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome). HIV-1 infection results in systemic CD4+ T cell depletion, thereby impairing cell-mediated immunity. MicroRNAs are short (~22 nucleotides long), endogenous single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3' UTR) of mRNA transcripts. The relation between HIV-1 infection and human miRNA expression profile has been previously investigated, and studies have shown that the virus can alter miRNA expression and vice versa. Here, we broaden the understanding of the HIV-1 infection process, and show that miRNA-186, 210 and 222 are up-regulated following HIV-1 infection of human Sup-T1 cells. As a result, the host miRNA target genes: Dicer1 (Double-Stranded RNA-Specific Endoribonuclease), HRB (HIV-1 Rev-binding protein) and HIV-EP2 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type I Enhancer Binding Protein 2), are down-regulated. Moreover, testing the miRNA-gene anti- correlation on the Jurkat and the HeLa-MAGI cell lines demonstrated the ability of the miRNAs to down-regulate viral expression as well. To conclude, we found that human miR-186, 210 and 222 directly regulate the human genes Dicer1, HRB and HIV-EP2, thus may be filling key roles during HIV-1 replication and miRNA biogenesis. This finding may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2912591736,"Although cycling has been associated with overuse/fatigue and acute injuries, there is lack of information regarding associated risk factors and prevention factors. The objective of the study was to determine the factors associated with injury, and perceptions of discomfort and pain in cyclists. A total of 739 cyclists completed an online questionnaire between February and October 2016. The questionnaire acquired information on participant demographics, characteristics related to cycling profile and fitness training, bike components and cycling posture, self-reported perceptions of comfort and pain, and injuries sustained in the last 12 months. Logistic regression models estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) that examined factors associated with reporting overuse/fatigue injury, acute injury, body discomfort, saddle discomfort, and pain while cycling. Odds of reporting an overuse/fatigue injury increased when the cyclists complemented training with running (OR = 1.74; 95%CI = 1.03–2.91) or swimming (OR = 2.17; 95%CI = 1.19–3.88), and with reported pain while cycling (OR = 1.17; 95%CI = 1.05–3.69) and not cycling (OR = 1.76; 95%CI = 1.07–2.90). Odds of reporting an acute injury increased when biking to work (OR = 1.79; 95%CI = 1.07–2.86), and decreased with increased average cycling speed (1-km/h decrease OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.88–0.97), and compared to low-end bike, with the use of mid-range (OR = 0.25; 95%CI = 0.09–0.72) and high-end bike (OR = 0.34; 95%CI = 0.13–0.96). Although body discomfort was only associated with saddle discomfort and the presence of pain during cycling, saddle discomfort was also associated with biking to work (OR = 0.46; 95%CI = 0.22–0.88). Finally, pain perception was associated with a number of factors such as ride to work, core training, cycling experience, saddle discomfort, pain while not cycling. Numerous factors are associated with injury, and perceptions of discomfort and pain in cyclists. Such factors should be considered when developing training routines, bicycle maintenance best practices, and injury prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W2911273095,"In this study we evaluated the association of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and alkaline pH as a minimally denaturing condition for the solubilization of inclusion bodies (IBs) generated by recombinant proteins expressed by Escherichia coli strains. The method was successfully applied to a recombinant form of the dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1). The minimal pH for IBs solubilization at 1 bar was 12 while a pH of 10 was sufficient for solubilization at HHP: 2.4 kbar for 90 min and 0.4 kbar for 14 h 30 min. An optimal refolding condition was achieved by compression of IBs at HHP and pH 10.5 in the presence of arginine, oxidized and reduced glutathiones, providing much higher yields (up to 8-fold) than association of HHP and GdnHCl via an established protocol. The refolded NS1, 109 ± 9.5 mg/L bacterial culture was recovered mainly as monomer and dimer, corresponding up to 90% of the total protein and remaining immunologically active. The proposed conditions represent an alternative for the refolding of immunologically active recombinant proteins expressed as IBs."
https://openalex.org/W2912746105,"Blockade of the programmed cell death protein/ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) is now commonly used for cancer immunotherapy and has therapeutic potential in chronic viral infections including HIV-1. PD-1/PD-L1 blockade could augment HIV-1-specific immune responses and reverse HIV-1 latency, but the latter effect has not been clearly shown. We tested the ability of the human anti-PD-L1 mAb BMS-936559 and the human anti-PD-1 mAb nivolumab to increase HIV-1 virion production ex vivo from different peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations obtained from donors on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), CD8-depleted PBMC, total CD4+ T cells, and resting CD4+ T cells were purified from whole blood of HIV-1-infected donors and cultured in varying concentrations of BMS-936559 (20, 5, or 1.25μg/mL) or nivolumab (5 or 1.25μg/mL), with or without anti-CD3/CD28 stimulatory antibodies. Culture supernatants were assayed for virion HIV-1 RNA by qRT-PCR. Ex vivo exposure to BMS-936559 or nivolumab, with or without anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, did not consistently increase HIV-1 virion production from blood mononuclear cell populations. Modest (2-fold) increases in virus production were observed in a subset of donors and in some cell types but were not reproducible in longitudinal samples. Cell surface expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 were not associated with changes in virus production. Ex vivo blockade of the PD-1 axis alone has limited effects on HIV-1 latency."
https://openalex.org/W2914383742,"Exercise and physical activity are critical to maintain bone mass and strength throughout life. Both exercise and physical activity subject bone to a unique combination of stimuli in the forms of dynamic loading and a systemic increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH). Although dynamic loading is considered to be the primary osteogenic stimuli, the influence of increasing PTH levels remains unclear. We hypothesize that activation of the PTH/PTH-related peptide type 1 receptor (PPR) along the osteoblast lineage facilitates bone formation and improved mechanical properties in response to exercise. To test this hypothesis, conditional PPR-knockout mice (PPRcKO) were generated in which PPR expression was deleted along the osteoblast lineage under the osterix promoter. At 8-weeks of age, both PPRfl/fl and PPRcKO mice were subjected to treadmill running or sedentary conditions for 5-weeks. Under sedentary conditions, PPRcKO mice displayed significantly less bone mass as well as smaller structural-level strength (yield-load and ultimate load), while tissue level properties were largely unaffected. However, PPRcKO mice exposed to exercise displayed significantly less structural-level and tissue-level mechanical properties when compared to exercised PPRfl/fl mice. Overall, these data demonstrate that PPR expression along the osteoblast lineage is essential for exercise to improve the mechanical properties of cortical bone. Furthermore, the influence of PPR activation on material properties is unique to exercise and not during normal growth and development."

The sample was comprised of 249 players (n = 109 defenders, n = 113 midfielders; and n = 27 forwards) from four of the major European Leagues (Bundesliga, English FA Premier League, Ligue 1, and La Liga) during the seasons 2008 to 2015. The dependent variables studied were: shooting accuracy, defense (the sum of defensive actions, tackles, blocks, and interceptions), yellow cards, red cards, passing accuracy, tackle success, and minutes played per match. Two-step cluster analysis allowed classifying the sample into three groups of defenders (national important, foreign important, and less important players) and four groups of midfielders and forwards (national important, foreign important, national less important, and foreign less important players). Magnitude Based Inference (MBI) was used to test the differences between player's performances during the years of analyses. The main results (very likely and most likely effects) showed better performance in the year prior to signing a new contract than the previous year for foreign important defenders (decreased number of red cards), national important midfielders (increased number of minutes played), foreign important forwards (increased minutes played and defense), and national important forwards (increased minutes played). In addition, performance was lower the year after signing the contract compared to the previous one for less important defenders (decreasing defense), national less important midfielders (decreased minutes played), and foreign less important forwards (decreased defense). On the other hand, the players showed better performance in defense and more minutes played the year after signing the contract for less important defenders, national less important midfielders, and foreign less important forwards. These results may assist coaches to decide on when a new contract should be signed or the duration of the contract."
https://openalex.org/W2914024229,"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacterium frequently isolated from contaminated platelet concentrates (PCs), a blood product used to treat bleeding disorders in transfusion patients. PCs offer an accidental niche for colonization of S. epidermidis by forming biofilms and thus avoiding clearance by immune factors present in this milieu. Using biochemical and microscopy techniques, we investigated the structural changes of the peptidoglycan (PG) and the biofilm matrix of S. epidermidis biofilms formed in whole-blood derived PCs compared to biofilms grown in glucose-supplemented trypticase soy broth (TSBg). Both, the PG and the biofilm matrix are primary mechanisms of defense against environmental stress. Here we show that in PCs, the S. epidermidis biofilm matrix is mainly of a proteinaceous nature with extracellular DNA, in contrast to the predominant polysaccharide nature of the biofilm matrix formed in TSBg cultures. PG profile studies demonstrated that the PG of biofilm cells remodels during PC storage displaying fewer muropeptides variants than those observed in TSBg. The PG muropeptides contain two chemical modifications (amidation and O-acetylation) previously associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents by other staphylococci. Our study highlights two key structural features of S. epidermidis that are remodeled when exposed to human platelets and could be used as targets to reduce septic transfusions events."
https://openalex.org/W2914139119,"Dental caries is considered a major health problem among schoolchildren in Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). According to Health Belief Model (HBM)-based research, children's oral health behavior can be determined by their guardians' beliefs. This study aimed to describe children's oral health behavior and its association with childhood dental caries, as well as to assess associations between children's tooth-brushing behavior and guardians' beliefs in an urban area of Lao PDR, using HBM. Data were collected from ten primary schools in the Sisattanak district, the Vientiane capital, between 2013 and 2014. Ten dentists with the help of dental hygienists and schoolteachers conducted dental health check-ups at the schools that diagnosed dental caries based on visual inspection. They also conducted a questionnaire-based survey with the schoolchildren's guardians to collect data including socio-economic and demographic information, their children's oral health behavior, and guardians' beliefs derived from HBM, including perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of child dental caries, perceived benefit of and perceived barrier to child's tooth brushing, and self-efficacy in making their children brush their teeth twice daily. A mixed-effects logistic regression model assessed the association between dental caries and children's oral health behavior and between children's tooth-brushing behavior and guardians' beliefs. Data from 1161 of 1304 (89.0%) children registered at the schools were used. The prevalence of dental caries was 82%. Children who brushed their teeth ≥ twice/day were significantly less likely to have dental caries than those brushing once or seldom (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.91). The number of children who brushed twice daily also significantly increased with the increased level of guardians' self-efficacy (OR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.91 to 2.41). In conclusion, childhood dental caries was associated with daily tooth brushing. Children's tooth-brushing behavior was associated with guardians' self-efficacy in making their children brush twice daily."
https://openalex.org/W2912828497,"Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a neglected infection affecting millions of people in tropical regions. There are several chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, but most of them are highly toxic and generate resistance. Currently, the development of allosteric inhibitors constitutes a promising research field, since it can improve the accessibility to more selective and less toxic medicines. To date, the allosteric drugs prediction is a state-of-the-art topic in rational structure-based computational design. In this work, a simulation strategy was developed for computational discovery of allosteric inhibitors, and it was applied to cruzain, a promising target and the major cysteine protease of T. cruzi. Molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations and network-based modelling of residue interactions were combined to characterize and compare molecular distinctive features of the apo form and the cruzain-allosteric inhibitor complexes. By using geometry-based criteria on trajectory snapshots, we predicted two main allosteric sites suitable for drug targeting. The results suggest dissimilar mechanisms exerted by the same allosteric site when binding different potential allosteric inhibitors. Finally, we identified the residues involved in suboptimal paths linking the identified site and the orthosteric site. The present study constitutes the first approximation to the design of cruzain allosteric inhibitors and may serve for future pharmacological intervention. Here, no major effects on active site structure were observed due to compound binding (modification of distance and angles between catalytic residues), which indicates that allosteric regulation in cruzain might be mediated via alterations of its dynamical properties similarly to allosteric inhibition of human cathepsin K (HCatK). The current findings are particularly relevant for the design of allosteric modulators of papain-like cysteine proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2912408905,"There are indications that lighting schedules applied during incubation can affect leg health at hatching and during rearing. The current experiment studied effects of lighting schedule: continuous light (24L), 12 hours of light, followed by 12 hours of darkness (12L:12D), or continuous darkness (24D) throughout incubation of broiler chicken eggs on the development and strength of leg bones, and the role of selected hormones in bone development. In the tibiatarsus and femur, growth and ossification during incubation and size and microstructure at day (D)0, D21, and D35 post hatching were measured. Plasma melatonin, growth hormone, and IGF-I were determined perinatally. Incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia, a leg pathology resulting from poor ossification at the bone’s epiphyseal plates, was determined at slaughter on D35. 24L resulted in lower embryonic ossification at embryonic day (E)13 and E14, and lower femur length, and lower tibiatarsus weight, length, cortical area, second moment of area around the minor axis, and mean cortical thickness at hatching on D0 compared to 12L:12D especially. Results were long term, with lower femur weight and tibiatarsus length, cortical and medullary area of the tibiatarsus, and second moment of area around the minor axis, and a higher incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia for 24L. Growth hormone at D0 was higher for 24D than for 12L:12D, with 24L intermediate, but plasma melatonin and IGF-I did not differ between treatments, and the role of plasma melatonin, IGF-I, and growth hormone in this process was therefore not clear. To conclude, in the current experiment, 24L during incubation of chicken eggs had a detrimental effect on embryonic leg bone development and later life leg bone strength compared to 24D and 12L:12D, while the light-dark rhythm of 12L:12D may have a stimulating effect on leg health."
https://openalex.org/W2913157461,"Objective Rectal colonization with Highly Resistant Gram-negative Rods (HR-GNRs) probably precedes infection. We aimed to assess the association between rectal HR-GNR colonization and subsequent HR-GNR infection in clinical patients during a follow-up period of one year in a historical cohort study design. Methods Rectal HR-GNR colonization was assessed by culturing. Subsequent development of infection was determined by assessing all clinical microbiological culture results extracted from the laboratory information system including clinical data regarding HR-GNR infections. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed with HR-GNR rectal colonization as independent variable and HR-GNR infection as dependent variable. Gender, age, antibiotic use, historic clinical admission and previous (HR-GNR) infections were included as possible confounders. Results 1133 patients were included of whom 68 patients (6.1%) were colonized with a HR-GNR. In total 22 patients with HR-GNR infections were detected. Urinary tract infections were most common (n = 14, 63.6%), followed by bloodstream infections (n = 5, 22.7%) and other infections (n = 8, 36.4%). Eight out of 68 HR-GNR colonized patients (11.8%) developed a subsequent HR-GNR infection compared to 14 out of 1065 HR-GNR negative patients (1.3%), resulting in an odds ratio (95% CI) of 7.1 (2.8–18.1) in the multivariable logistic regression analyses. Conclusions Rectal colonization with a HR-GNR was a significant risk factor for a subsequent HR-GNR infection. This implies that historical colonization culture results should be considered in the choice of empirical antibiotic therapy to include coverage of the cultured HR-GNR, at least in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2914694280,"Batrachuperus yenyuanensis, commonly known as Yenyuan Stream Salamander, is a hynobiid species inhabiting high-altitude (2440-4025 m above sea level) mountain stream and pond environments along the eastern fringe of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in western Sichuan Province, China. Although the species has been known for almost 70 years since its initial discovery in 1950, a thorough osteological description has never been provided. Our study provides a detailed account of the bony anatomy of this species, based on micro computed tomography scanning of multiple specimens collected from the type locality Shuangertang at Bailinshan, Yanyuan County, and several other localities in Sichuan Province. Our revised species diagnosis utilizes both bony and soft anatomical features. Comparative study of the specimens from the type locality in Yanyuan area with those from the nearby Xichang and Mianning areas confirms that they all pertain to Batrachuperus yenyuanensis, thereby removing doubt on the occurrence of the species in the latter areas. With this confirmation, the distribution of the species is extended from the type locality northwards some 180 km to the Mianning area, on both the west and east sides of the Yalong River, which is a major tributary of the upper Yangtze River. This distribution pattern indicates that the biogeographic origin and historical evolution of the species are closely associated with the orogeny of the Hengduan Mountains and formation of the Yalong River. Given the basalmost position of Batrachuperus yenyuanensis in relation to other congeneric species based on molecular studies, however, early expansion of the species distribution by dispersal is expected following the origin of the genus in early-middle Miocene in western Sichuan Province. Thus, the species may well have achieved its current distribution in western Sichuan before the drastic uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in Pliocene."
https://openalex.org/W2912192613,"For polymer-particle composites, limited thermodynamic compatibility of polymers and particles often leads to poor dispersal and agglomeration of the particles in the matrix, which negatively impacts the mechanics of composites. To study the impact of particle compatibility in polymer matrices on the mechanical properties of composites, we here study composite silica- protein based hydrogels. The polymer used is a previously studied telechelic protein-based polymer with end groups that form triple helices, and the particles are silica nanoparticles that only weakly associate with the polymer matrix. At 1mM protein polymer, up to 7% of silica nanoparticles can be embedded in the hydrogel. At higher concentrations the system phase separates. Oscillatory rheology shows that at high frequencies the particles strengthen the gels by acting as short-lived multivalent cross-links, while at low frequencies, the particles reduce the gel strength, presumably by sequestering part of the protein polymers in such a way that they can no longer contribute to the network strength. As is generally observed for polymer/particle composites, shear-induced polymer desorption from the particles leads to a viscous dissipation that strongly increases with increasing particle concentration. While linear rheological properties as function of particle concentration provide no signals for an approaching phase separation, this is very different for the non-linear rheology, especially fracture. Strain-at-break decreases rapidly with increasing particle concentration and vanishes as the phase boundary is approached, suggesting that the interfaces between regions of high and low particle densities in composites close to phase separation provide easy fracture planes."
https://openalex.org/W2912495104,"In resource limited settings, there is variability in the level of adherence to clinical guidelines in the inpatient management of children with common conditions like severe anemia. However, there is limited data on the effect of adherence to clinical guidelines on inpatient mortality in children managed for severe anemia.We analyzed data from an uncontrolled before and after in-service training intervention to improve quality of care in Lira and Jinja regional referral hospitals in Uganda. Inpatient records of children aged 0 to 5 years managed as cases of 'severe anemia (SA)' were reviewed to ascertain adherence to clinical guidelines and compare inpatient deaths in SA children managed versus those not managed according to clinical guidelines. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between clinical care factors and inpatient deaths amongst patients managed for SA.A total of 1,131 children were assigned a clinical diagnosis of 'severe anemia' in the two hospitals. There was improvement in the level of care after the in-service training intervention with more children being managed according to clinical guidelines compared to the period before, 218/510 (42.7%) vs 158/621 (25.4%) (p < 0.001). Overall, children managed according to clinical guidelines had reduced risk of inpatient mortality compared to those not managed according to clinical guidelines, [OR 0.28, (95%, CI 0.14, 0.55), p = 0.001]. Clinical care factors associated with decreased risk of inpatient death included, having pre-transfusion hemoglobin done to confirm diagnosis [OR 0.5; 95% CI 0.29, 0.87], a co-morbid diagnosis of severe malaria [OR 0.4; 95% CI 0.25, 0.76], and being reviewed after admission by a clinician [OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.18, 0.59], while a co-morbid diagnosis of severe acute malnutrition was associated with increased risk of inpatient death [OR 4.2; 95% CI 2.15, 8.22].Children with suspected SA who are managed according to clinical guidelines have lower in-hospital mortality than those not managed according to the guidelines. Efforts to reduce inpatient mortality in SA children in resource-limited settings should focus on training and supporting health workers to adhere to clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W2913674509,"Cancer immunotherapy has highlighted the clinical relevance of enhancing anti-tumor response of CD8+ T cells in several cancer types. Little is known, however, about the involvement of the immune system in extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD). We examined the cytotoxicity and the effector functions of CD8+ T cells using paired samples of peripheral blood and tumors by flow cytometry. Expression levels of perforin, granzyme B, IFN-g, TNF-a, and IL-2 in CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were significantly lower than those in CD8+ T cells of peripheral blood. Significantly higher expression of PD-1 was found in CD8+TILs than in CD8+ T cells of peripheral blood. A high number of CD8+ cells was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) adjusted with age, sex, and clinical stage (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.03, P = 0.045, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–24.4). On the other hand, the number of PD-1+ cells was not associated with OS or disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, we found that tumor cells produced immunosuppressive molecule indoleamine 2,3-dyoxygenae (IDO). In conclusion, CD8+ TILs displayed an exhausted phenotype in EMPD. IDO expression seemed more relevant in inducing CD8 exhaustion than PD-1 upregulation or PD-L1 expression by immune cells. Restoring the effector functions of CD8+ TILs could be an effective treatment strategy for advanced EMPD."
https://openalex.org/W2912175677,"Notwithstanding the pioneering achievements of studies on arctic mummies in Siberia, there are insufficient data for any comprehensive understanding of the bio-cultural details of medieval people living in the region. In the Western Siberian arctic, permafrost mummies have been found in 12th to 13th century graves located in the Zeleny Yar (Z-Y) burial ground (66°19'4.54""С; 67°21'13.54""В). In 2013–2016, we were fortunate to be able to excavate that cemetery, locating a total of 47 burials, including cases of mummification. Some of these mummies had been wrapped in a multi-layered birch-bark cocoon. After removal of the cocoon, we conducted interdisciplinary studies using various scientific techniques. Gross anatomical examination and CT radiography showed that the internal organs were still well preserved inside the body cavities. Under light and electron microscopy, the histological findings were very similar to those for naturally mummified specimens discovered in other countries. Ancient DNA analysis showed that the Z-Y mummies’ mtDNA haplotypes belong to five different haplogroups, namely U5a (#34), H3ao (#53), D (#67–1), U4b1b1 (#67–2), and D4j8 (#68), which distinguish them for their unique combination of Western- and Eastern Siberia-specific mtDNA haplogroups. Our interdisciplinary study obtained fundamental information that will form the foundation of successful future investigations on medieval mummies found in the Western Siberian arctic."

https://openalex.org/W2913617669,The current research examined the links between depressive symptomology and anxiety on the fading of affect associated with positive and negative autobiographical memories. Participants (N = 296) recalled and rated positive and negative events in terms of how pleasant or unpleasant they were at the time they occurred and at the time of event recollection. Multilevel mediation analyses identified evidence that higher levels of depressive symptoms were directly associated with lower affect fade for both negative and positive memories. Tests of indirect effects indicated that depressive symptoms were indirectly related to lower affect fade for negative (but not positive) autobiographical memories via the heightened tendency to think about negative (but not positive) memories. Anxiety was unrelated to affect fade both directly and indirectly. These results suggest that people higher in depressive symptoms retain more negative affect due to an increased likelihood of thinking about negative autobiographical events.
https://openalex.org/W2914386176,"Background Lack of social awareness is a major barrier to the development of palliative care. Mass media influences public opinion, and frequently deal with palliative care contributing to its image and public understanding. Aim To analyse how palliative care is portrayed in Spanish newspapers, as well as the contribution made by the press to its social representation. Design Based on criteria of scope and editorial plurality, four print newspapers were selected. Using the newspaper archive MyNews (www.mynews.es), articles published between 2009 and 2014 containing the words “palliative care” or “palliative medicine” were identified. Sociological discourse analysis was performed on the identified texts on two levels: a) contextual analysis, focusing on the message as a statement; b) interpretative analysis, considering the discourse as a social product. Results We examined 262 articles. Politician and healthcare professionals were the main representatives transmitting messages on palliative care. The discourses identified were characterised by: strong ideological and moral content focusing on social debate, strong ties linking palliative care and death and, to a lesser degree, as a healthcare service. The messages transmitted by representatives with direct experience in palliative care (professionals, patients and families) contributed the most to building a positive image of this healthcare practice. Overall, media reflect different interests in framing public understanding about palliative care. Conclusion The knowledge generated about how palliative care is reflected in the printed media may help to understand better one of the main barriers to its development not only in Spain, but also in other contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2911572445,"The authors compared maximal tumor diameters between fresh lung tissue and axial and multiplanar reformatted chest computed-tomography (CT) images in lung adenocarcinoma and investigated the factors affecting tumor-size discrepancies. This study included 135 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas. An experienced pulmonary pathologist aimed to cut the largest tumor section and measured pathological tumor size (PTS) in fresh specimens. Radiological maximal tumor sizes (RTS) were retrospectively measured on axial (RTSax) and multiplanar reformatted (RTSre) chest CT images. Mean PTS, RTSax, and RTSre were 19.13 mm, 18.63 mm, and 20.80 mm, respectively. RTSre was significantly larger than PTS (mean difference, 1.68 mm; p<0.001). RTSax was also greater than PTS for 6-10-mm and 11-20-mm tumors. PTS and RTS were strongly positively correlated (RTSax, r2 = 0.719, p<0.001; RTSre, r2 = 0.833, p<0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.915 between PTS and RTSax and 0.954 between PTS and RTSre. Postoperative down-staging occurred in 11.0% and 27.4% of tumors on performing radiological staging using RTSax and RTSre, respectively. Postoperative up-staging occurred in 12.3% and 1.4% of tumors on performing radiological staging using RTSax and RTSre, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that pleural dimpling (p = 0.024) was an independent factor affecting differences between PTS and RTSax. Specimen type (p = 0.012) and tumor location (p = 0.020) were independent factors affecting differences between PTS and RTSre. In conclusion, RTSre was significantly larger than PTS and caused postoperative down-staging in 27.4% of the tumors. Reliability analysis revealed that RTSre was more strongly correlated with PTS than RTSax. Specimen type and anatomical tumor location influenced the measured size differences between PTS and RTSre."

Its assessment remains to be perplexing and requires accurate measurements. Thus, this study intended to develop a valid and reliable reflective tool in assessing IPL as a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) outcome.A one-group post-posttest pre-experimental design with tool development was employed to establish the validity and reliability of the ""Inventory of Reflective Vignette-Interprofessional Learning"" (IRV-IPL). This tool was developed from an extensive literature review and designed with three segments to assess interprofessional competencies before, after, and what if scenarios using vignettes. After it was validated by education experts (n = 5) and written consent forms were signed by the participants, the IRV-IPL was pilot tested among healthcare professionals (n = 10) for analysis and improvement. During the actual implementation, it was administered to healthcare professionals (n = 45) who participated in a university-provided CPD event. Collected data underwent validity and reliability testing.IRV-IPL generated excellent internal consistency (α = 0.98), and across all segments of collaboration (α = 0.96), coordination (α = 0.96), cooperation (α = 0.96), communication (α = 0.97), and commendation (α = 0.98). Items exhibited significantly positive large correlations (r > 0.35, p < 0.05) in all segments showing beneficial measures for postdictive validity in recalling prior interprofessional competencies, and predictive validity in estimating interprofessional learning as an outcome of CPD and alternative interventions.This study provided a piece of groundwork evidence on the use of IRV-IPL as a reflective assessment tool for interprofessional learning in CPD contexts. Further studies are essential to explore the educational utility of IRV framework in crafting relevant assessments and to establish construct validity of IRV-IPL using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses."

Hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) has a protective effect on lung, myocardial, and central nervous system ischemic injury models. However, no study has evaluated its protective effects in an experimental retinal I/R injury model. In this study, retinal I/R injury was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by elevating the intraocular pressure to 110 mmHg for 60 minutes. HCA was induced before and after the injury. After 24 hours, the terminal dUTP nick end labeling assay was performed. Moreover, the ratios of cleaved caspase-3/total caspase-3, phosphorylated IκB/IκB, and phosphorylated p38 were measured through Western blotting. After 7 days, the rats' aqueous humor was analyzed. In addition, electroretinography and retinal thickness measurement were performed in the rats. Moreover, the retinal neural cell line RGC-5 was exposed to 500 μM H2O2 for 24 hours to induce a sustained oxidative stress in vitro. The effects of HCA were evaluated by comparing oxidative stress, MAPK signals, NF-κB signals, survival rates, and apoptosis rates in the RGC-5 cells before and after H2O2 exposure. We further investigated whether the potent I/R-protective heat shock protein (HSP) 32 contribute to protective effects of HCA. Our results indicated that HCA has protective effects against retinal I/R injury both in vivo and in vitro, at multiple levels, including antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and functional retinal cell protection. Further research clarifying the role of HCA in retinal I/R injury prevention and treatment is warranted."

However, possible risks of EQ used in aquafeed for fish health have not yet been characterized. The present study investigated the toxicity and dose-response of subchronic dietary EQ exposure at doses ranging from 41 to 9666 mg EQ/kg feed in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Feed at concentrations higher than 1173 mg EQ/kg were rejected by the fish, resulting in reduced feed intake and growth performance. No mortality was observed in fish exposed to any of the doses. A multi-omic screening of metabolome and proteome in salmon liver indicated an effect of dietary EQ on bioenergetics pathways and hepatic redox homeostasis in fish fed concentrations above 119 mg EQ/kg feed. Increased energy expenditure associated with an upregulation of hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation and induction and carbohydrate catabolic pathways resulted in a dose-dependent depletion of intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in liver histological sections, decreasing whole body lipid levels and altered purine/pyrimidine metabolism. Increased GSH and TBARS in the liver indicated a state of oxidative stress, which was associated with activation of the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and glutathione-mediated detoxification processes. However, no oxidative DNA damage was observed. As manifestation of altered energy metabolism, the depletion of liver intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles was considered the critical endpoint for benchmark dose assessment, and a BMDL10 of 243 mg EQ/kg feed was derived as a safe upper limit of EQ exposure in Atlantic salmon."

The number of coauthors increased over the years from 2 to 7. A considerable proportion of authors, institutions and countries presented only once (53.7%/25.7%/13.2%). Authors with a high number of abstracts and with a large local network were often among those with a higher publication rate and success (R2 = 0.508 for Pearson's correlation between weight and h-index, R2 = 0.474 for degree centrality, R2 = 0.364 for lobby-index). Closeness and betweenness centralities were less correlated (R2 = 0.127/R2 = 0.33, resp.). The institutions showed a similar impact of local interactions on publication success (degree centrality R2 = 0.417, weight R2 = 0.308), while countries demonstrated a higher correlation of betweenness centrality and h-Index (R2 = 0.704) emphasizing their brokerage role. Of 553 institutions, 520 collaborated within 13 communities and belonged to the large scientific network. 33 satellite institutions had no connections to the central network. They attended 1-4 congresses over a period of 1-16 years.A large scientific network has been developed during the recent 42 years.

This study aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes and identify poor prognostic factors in the renal transplant programme at Groote Schuur Hospital [GSH], Cape Town. Method Data were collected on all patients who underwent a kidney transplant at GSH from 1st July 2010 to the 30 June 2015. Analyses were performed to assess baseline characteristics, graft and patient survival, as well as predictors of poor outcome. Results 198 patients were transplanted. The mean age was 38 +/- 10.5 years, 127 (64.1%) were male, and 86 (43.4%) were of African ethnicity. Deceased donor organs were used for 130 (66.7%) patients and living donors for 65 (33.3%). There were > 5 HLA mismatches in 58.9% of transplants. Sepsis was the commonest cause of death and delayed graft function [DGF] occurred in 41 (21.4%) recipients. Patient survival was 90.4% at 1 year and 83.1% at 5 years. Graft survival was 89.4% at 1 year and 80.0% at 5 years. DGF (HR 2.83 (1.12–7.19), p value = 0.028) and recipient age > 40 years (HR 3.12 (1.26–7.77), p value = 0.014) were predictors of death. Conclusion Despite the high infectious burden, stratified immunosuppression and limited tissue typing this study reports encouraging results from a resource constrained transplant programme in South Africa. Renal transplantation is critical to improve access to treatment of end stage kidney disease where access to dialysis is limited."
https://openalex.org/W2914689508,"We previously found that senescence of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T cells is accelerated in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) due to a high-fat diet (HFD), and that these senescent-associated T cells cause chronic inflammation of visceral adipose tissue through secretion of osteopontin, provoking systemic insulin resistance. In this study, we examined whether the development of chronic inflammation and senescence-associated T cells in VAT of DIO mice was improved by long-term weight loss after switching to normal chow (NC) or by administration of a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (tofogliflozin). Wild-type mice were fed an HFD for 26 weeks from 4 weeks old. At 30 weeks of age, half of these DIO mice were switched to NC with or without 0.005% tofogliflozin for 38 weeks. The other mice remained on the HFD with or without 0.005% tofogliflozin for 38 weeks. When DIO mice were switched to NC, their weight decreased to that of mice kept on NC since weaning. After 38 weeks (68 weeks of age), chronic inflammation of the VAT subsided with disappearance of senescence-associated T cells. In the HFD groups, the carbohydrate intake per mouse was half or less of that in the NC group, and urinary glucose excretion by the effect of tofogliflozin was lower in the HFD mice than in the NC mice. Mice that remained on the HFD showed no improvement in chronic inflammation in VAT, possibly because urinary glucose excretion was not sufficiently promoted by tofogliflozin due to the low carbohydrate intake. Thus, no improvement in glucose metabolism or weight loss was observed in these mice."

This study aims to explore physician characteristics associated with proper assessment of overstated conclusions in research abstracts.A secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.We recruited 567 volunteers from the Japan Primary Care Association.Participants were randomly assigned to read the abstract of a research paper, with or without an overstatement, and to rate its validity. Our primary outcome was proper assessment of the validity of its conclusions. We investigated the association of physician characteristics and proper assessment using logistic regression models and evaluated the interaction between the associated characteristics and overstatement.We found significant associations between proper assessment and post-graduate year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.91, for every 10-year increase) and research experience as a primary investigator (PI; OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.65 to 5.34). Post-graduate year and PI had significant interaction with overstatement (P = 0.015 and < 0.001, respectively). Among participants who read abstracts without an overstatement, post-graduate year was not associated with proper assessment (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.33), and PI experience was associated with lower scores of the validity (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.96).Physicians who have been in practice longer should be trained in distinguishing overstatements in abstract conclusions. Physicians with research experience might be informed that they tend to rate the validity of research lower regardless of the presence or absence of overstatements.UMIN000026269."
https://openalex.org/W2913035410,"With an emphasis on ballistic movements, an accurately anticipated neural control is an essential prerequisite to deliver a motor response coincidentally with the event of ground contact. This study investigated how previous knowledge of the ground condition affects proactive and reactive motor control in drop jumps (DJ). Thereby, human anticipatory capacity of muscle activation was investigated regarding neuromuscular activation, joint kinematics and peak forces associated with DJ performance. In 18 subjects, the effect of knowledge of two different surface conditions during DJs was evaluated. Peak force, ground-contact-time (GCT), rate of force development (RFD) and jump height were assessed. Electromyographic (EMG) activities of the m. soleus (SOL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) were assessed for 150ms before (PRE) and during ground contact (GC) for the short-, medium-, and long-latency responses. Ankle and knee joint kinematics were recorded in the sagittal plane.In the unknown conditions peak force, RFD and jump height declined, GCT was prolonged, proactive EMG activity (PRE) in SOL and GM was diminished (P<0.05). During GC, a decline in EMG activity in the unknown condition was manifested for SOL and GM for the SLR, MLR and LLR (P<0.05). Ankle and knee joint deflections during GC were increased in the unknown vs. known condition (P<0.05). Peak force, RFD and jump height were positively correlated to GM-EMG in PRE, SLR, MLR and LLR (P<0.05). Results revealed that proactive and reactive modulations in muscle activity prior and during GC are interrelated to the force-time characteristics and height of the jumps. The unknown condition revealed a comparable neuromuscular activity during pre-activation for both conditions, followed by an inhibition in the subsequent phase after touch down. These findings underline that anticipation is a determining factor influencing timing and adjustment of motor responses to accomplish ballistic movements regarding precision and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2913723838,"The sterile insect technique (SIT) integrated in area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) programmes is being used for the successful management of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) which is a horticultural pest of economic importance in tropical and subtropical countries. All programmes with an SIT component are using the VIENNA genetic sexing strains (GSS), mainly the VIENNA 8 GSS, which have been developed by applying classical genetic approaches. The VIENNA 8 GSS carries two selectable markers, the white pupae and the temperature sensitive lethal genes, which allows the production and release of only males thus increasing the biological efficiency and cost effectiveness of SIT applications. However, mass rearing may affect quality traits of the GSS, in which case replenishment of the colony with wild flies is recommended, a process which is tedious and time consuming. We previously reported the development of a cryopreservation protocol for the VIENNA 8D53+ strain. In the present study, we report on the evaluation of the cryopreserved strain VIENNA 8D53+/Cryo-228L, reared under semi mass rearing conditions, for production parameters, quality control indices and mating competitiveness of males, in a comparative way with the non-cryopreserved VIENNA 8D53+ strain, against wild type males. The VIENNA 8D53+ and VIENNA 8D53+/Cryo-228L strains were similar for production parameters viz. egg production, pupal production, pupal recovery, and quality control indices like fly emergence, sex ratio and flight ability. Males from both strains were equally competitive with males of the wild type strain in achieving mating with wild type females under field cage conditions. Results are discussed in the context of cryopreservation as a potential backup strategy for refreshing the mass rearing colony with biological material from a cryopreserved stock."
https://openalex.org/W2914586723,"Sevoflurane postconditioning (sevo postC) is an attractive and amenable approach that can protect the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-injury. Unlike ischemic preconditioning (IPC), sevo postC does not require additional induced ischemic periods to a heart that is already at risk. IPC was previously shown to generate myocardial protection against I/R-injury through regulation of iron homeostasis and de novo ferritin synthesis, a process found to be impaired in the diabetic state. The current study investigated whether alterations in iron homeostasis and ferritin mRNA and protein accumulation are also involved in the cardioprotective effects generated by sevo postC. It was also investigated whether the protective effects of sevo postC in the diabetic state can be salvaged by simvastatin, through inducing nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability/activity, in isolated streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic hearts (DH). Isolated rat hearts from healthy Controls and diabetic animals were retrogradely perfused using the Langendorff configuration and subjected to prolonged ischemia and reperfusion, with and without (2.4 and 3.6%) sevo postC and/or pre-treatment with simvastatin (0.5 mg/kg). Sevo postC significantly reduced infarct size and improved myocardial function in healthy Controls but not in isolated DH. The sevo postC mediated myocardial protection against I/R-injury was not associated with de novo ferrtin synthesis. Furthermore, simvastatin aggravated myocardial injury after sevo postC in STZ-induced DHs, likely due to increasing NO levels. Despite the known mechanistic overlaps between PC and postC stimuli, distinct differences underlie the cardioprotective interventions against myocardial I/R-injury and are impaired in the DH. Sevo postC mediated cardioprotection, unlike IPC, does not involve de novo ferritin accumulation and cannot be rescued by simvastatin in STZ-induced DHs."
https://openalex.org/W2914895037,"Interleukin-21 (IL-21), a member of the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc) family, is secreted by CD4+ T cells and natural killer T cells and induces effector function through interactions with the IL-21 receptor (IL-21R)/γc complex expressed on both immune and non-immune cells. Numerous studies suggest that IL-21 plays a significant role in autoimmune disorders. Therapeutic intervention to disrupt the IL-21/IL-21R/γc interaction and inhibit subsequent downstream signal transduction could offer a treatment paradigm for these diseases. Potent neutralizing antibodies reported in the literature were generated after extensive immunizations with human IL-21 alone and in combination with various adjuvants. To circumvent the laborious method of antibody generation while targeting a conserved functional epitope, we designed a novel alternating-antigen immunization strategy utilizing both human and cynomolgus monkey (cyno) IL-21. Despite the high degree of homology between human and cyno IL-21, our alternating-immunization strategy elicited higher antibody titers and more potent neutralizing hybridomas in mice than did the immunization with human IL-21 antigen alone. The lead hybridoma clone was humanized by grafting the murine complementarity-determining regions onto human germline framework templates, using a unique rational design. The final humanized and engineered antibody, MEDI7169, encodes only one murine residue at the variable heavy/light-chain interface, retains the sub-picomolar affinity for IL-21, specifically inhibits IL-21/IL-21R-mediated signaling events and is currently under clinical development as a potential therapeutic agent for autoimmune diseases. This study provides experimental evidence of the immune system's potential to recognize and respond to shared epitopes of antigens from distinct species, and presents a generally applicable, novel method for the rapid generation of exceptional therapeutic antibodies using the hybridoma platform."
https://openalex.org/W2911778089,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is often injured during sport. The Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) has been used to evaluate ankle and knee stability of the supporting leg while reaching in eight different directions with the non-stance leg. We hypothesized that the SEBT might be useful in categorising ACL injury risk. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between knee valgus alignment during single leg drop landing (SDL) and alignment of the trunk and lower limb during the SEBT.A three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to measure the trunk, hip and knee angles during SDL and the SEBT. Groupings were allocated based on 5 degrees of knee valgus angle during SDL. Independent t-test's were used to identify differences in the trunk, hip and knee angles between the two groups.The knee valgus angles in the knee valgus group were greater than those in the control group in five directions of the SEBT (p < 0.05). In addition, the hip internal rotation angle in the knee valgus group was lower than that in the control group during two directions of the SEBT (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the knee flexion and trunk right rotation angles in the knee valgus group were lower than those in the control group in two directions of the SEBT (p < 0.05).Decreases in hip internal rotation, knee flexion and trunk rotation to the supporting leg during the SEBT might be considered as risk factors for non-contact ACL injury."
https://openalex.org/W2912905373,"Tumors are heterogeneous in the sense that they consist of multiple subpopulations of cells, referred to as subclones, each of which is characterized by a distinct profile of genomic variations such as somatic mutations. Inferring the underlying clonal landscape has become an important topic in that it can help in understanding cancer development and progression, and thereby help in improving treatment. We describe a novel state-space model, based on the feature allocation framework and an efficient sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm, using the somatic mutation data obtained from tumor samples to estimate the number of subclones, as well as their characterization. Our approach, by design, is capable of handling any number of mutations. Via extensive simulations, our method exhibits high accuracy, in most cases, and compares favorably with existing methods. Moreover, we demonstrated the validity of our method through analyzing real tumor samples from patients from multiple cancer types (breast, prostate, and lung). Our results reveal driver mutation events specific to cancer types, and indicate clonal expansion by manual phylogenetic analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2913813455,"Due to the extreme tissue and species restriction of the papillomaviruses (PVs), there is a great need for animal models that accurately mimic PV infection in humans for testing therapeutic strategies against human papillomaviruses (HPVs). In this study, we present data that demonstrate that in terms of gene expression during initial viral DNA amplification, Macaca fascicularis PV (MfPV) types 5 and 8 appear to be similar to mucosal oncogenic HPVs, while MfPV1 (isolated from skin) resembles most high-risk cutaneous beta HPVs (HPV5). Similarities were also observed in replication properties during the initial amplification phase of the MfPV genomes. We demonstrate that high-risk mucosal HPV-specific inhibitors target the transient replication of the MfPV8 genomes, which indicates that similar pathways are used by the high-risk HPVs and MfPVs during their genome replication. Taking all into account, we propose that Macaca fascicularis may serve as a highly relevant model for preclinical tests designed to evaluate therapeutic strategies against HPV-associated lesions."
