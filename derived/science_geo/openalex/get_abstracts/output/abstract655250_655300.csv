Once hospitalised, the chance for another hospitalisation increases sharply with large impact on well-being of patients and costs. The pattern of readmissions is very complex, but poorly understood for multiple chronic diseases. Methods This cohort study of administrative discharge data between 2009–2014 from 21 tertiary hospitals (eight USA, five UK, four Australia, four continental Europe) investigated rates and reasons of readmissions to the same hospital within 30 days after unplanned admission with one of the following chronic conditions; heart failure; atrial fibrillation; myocardial infarction; hypertension; stroke; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); bacterial pneumonia; diabetes mellitus; chronic renal disease; anaemia; arthritis and other cardiovascular disease. Proportions of readmissions with similar versus different diseases were analysed. Results Of 4,901,584 admissions, 866,502 (17.7%) were due to the 12 chronic conditions. In-hospital, 43,573 (5.0%) patients died, leaving 822,929 for readmission analysis. Of those, 87,452 (10.6%) had an emergency 30-day readmission, rates ranged from 2.8% for arthritis to 18.4% for COPD. One third were readmitted with the same condition, ranging from 53% for anaemia to 11% for arthritis. Reasons for readmission were due to another chronic condition in 10% to 35% of the cases, leaving 30% to 70% due to reasons other than the original 12 conditions (most commonly, treatment related complications and infections). The chance of being readmitted with the same cause was lower in the USA, for female patients, with increasing age, more co-morbidities, during study period and with longer initial length of stay. Conclusion Readmission in chronic conditions is very common and often caused by diseases other than the index hospitalisation. Interventions to reduce readmissions should therefore focus not only on the primary condition but on a holistic consideration of all the patient’s comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W3027782394,"Preliminary diagnosis of fungal infections can rely on microscopic examination. However, in many cases, it does not allow unambiguous identification of the species by microbiologist due to their visual similarity. Therefore, it is usually necessary to use additional biochemical tests. That involves additional costs and extends the identification process up to 10 days. Such a delay in the implementation of targeted therapy may be grave in consequence as the mortality rate for immunosuppressed patients is high. In this paper, we apply a machine learning approach based on deep neural networks and Fisher Vector (advanced bag-of-words method) to classify microscopic images of various fungi species. Our approach has the potential to make the last stage of biochemical identification redundant, shortening the identification process by 2-3 days, and reducing the cost of the diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3038382700,"Lactobacilli, which are probiotic commensal bacteria that mainly reside in the human small intestine, have attracted attention for their ability to exert health-promoting effects and beneficially modulate host immunity. However, host epithelial-commensal bacterial interactions are still largely unexplored because of limited access to human small intestinal tissues. Recently, we described an in vitro maturation technique for generating adult-like, mature human intestinal organoids (hIOs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) that closely resemble the in vivo tissue structure and cellular diversity. Here, we established an in vitro human model to study the response to colonization by commensal bacteria using luminal microinjection into mature hIOs, allowing for the direct examination of epithelial-bacterial interactions. Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus plantarum were more likely to survive and colonize when microinjected into the lumen of mature hIOs than when injected into immature hIOs, as determined by scanning electron microscopy, colony formation assay, immunofluorescence, and real-time imaging with L plantarum expressing red fluorescent protein. The improved mature hIO-based host epithelium system resulted from enhanced intestinal epithelial integrity via upregulation of mucus secretion and tight junction proteins. Our study indicates that mature hIOs are a physiologically relevant in vitro model system for studying commensal microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W3038970593,"Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most devastating fungal diseases affecting grain crops and Fusarium graminearum is the most aggressive causal species. Several evidences shown that stomatal closure is involved in the first line of defence against plant pathogens. However, there is very little evidence to show that photosynthetic parameters change in inoculated plants. The aim of the present study was to study the role of stomatal regulation in wheat after F. graminearum inoculation and explore its possible involvement in FHB resistance. RT-qPCR revealed that genes involved in stomatal regulation are induced in the resistant Sumai3 cultivar but not in the susceptible Rebelde cultivar. Seven genes involved in the positive regulation of stomatal closure were up-regulated in Sumai3, but it is most likely, that two genes, TaBG and TaCYP450, involved in the negative regulation of stomatal closure, were strongly induced, suggesting that FHB response is linked to cross-talk between the genes promoting and inhibiting stomatal closure. Increasing temperature of spikes in the wheat genotypes and a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency in Rebelde but not in Sumai3, were observed, confirming the hypothesis that photosynthetic parameters are related to FHB resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3039102714,"Understanding the mechanisms governing complex traits variation is a requirement for efficient crop improvement. In this study, the molecular characterization, marker-trait associations and the possibility for genomic selection in a collection of 281 Kersting’s groundnut accessions were carried out. The diversity panel was phenotyped using an Alpha lattice design with two replicates in two contrasting environments. Accessions were genotyped using genotyping by sequencing technology. Genome-wide association analyses were performed between single nucleotide polymorphism markers and yield-related traits across tested environments. SNP markers were used to calculate the observed (Ho) and expected heterozygosity (He), and the total gene diversity (Ht). Genetic differentiation among accessions across ecological regions of origin was analysed. Our results revealed 493 quality SNPs of which 113 had a minor allele frequency>0.05, a total gene diversity of 0.43 and average Ho and He values of 0.04 and 0.22, respectively. Four clusters, highly differentiated by seed coat colour (Fst = 0.79), were identified. The population structure analysis showed two subpopulations with high differentiation across ecological regions (Fst = 0.37). The GWAS revealed 10 significant marker-trait associations, of which six SNPs were consistent across environments. The genomic selection through cross-validation showed moderate to high prediction accuracies for leaflet length, seed dimension traits, 100 seed weight, days to 50% flowering and days to maturity. This demonstrates the existence of genetic variability within Kersting’s groundnut and shows the potential for the improvement of the species. The findings also provide a first insight into the phenotype-to-genotype relationships in Kersting’s groundnut, using SNP markers."
https://openalex.org/W3038363056,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is present in the background of around 30% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). The genetic predisposition effect of this autoimmune condition is not thoroughly understood. We analyzed the microarray expression profiles of 13 HT, eight PTCs with (w/) coexisting HT, six PTCs without (w/o) coexisting HT, six micro PTCs (mPTCs), and three normal thyroid (TN) samples. Based on a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change (FC) > 2, four comparison groups were defined, which were HT vs. TN; PTC w/ HT vs. TN; PTC w/o HT vs. TN; and mPTC vs. TN. A Venn diagram displayed 15 different intersecting and non-intersecting differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets, of which a set of 71 DEGs, shared between the two comparison groups HT vs. TN ∩ PTC w/ HT vs. TN, harbored the relatively largest number of genes related to immune and inflammatory functions; oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS); DNA damage and DNA repair; cell cycle; and apoptosis. The majority of the 71 DEGs were upregulated and the most upregulated DEGs included a number of immunoglobulin kappa variable genes, and other immune-related genes, e.g., CD86 molecule (CD86), interleukin 2 receptor gamma (IL2RG), and interferon, alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6). Upregulated genes preferentially associated with other gene ontologies (GO) were, e.g., STAT1, MMP9, TOP2A, and BRCA2. Biofunctional analysis revealed pathways related to immunogenic functions. Further data analysis focused on the set of non-intersecting 358 DEGs derived from the comparison group of HT vs. TN, and on the set of 950 DEGs from the intersection of all four comparison groups. In conclusion, this study indicates that, besides immune/inflammation-related genes, also genes associated with oxidative stress, ROS, DNA damage, DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis are comparably more deregulated in a data set shared between HT and PTC w/ HT. These findings are compatible with the conception of a genetic sequence where chronic inflammatory response is accompanied by deregulation of genes and biofunctions associated with oncogenic transformation. The generated data set may serve as a source for identifying candidate genes and biomarkers that are practical for clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W3038377562,"The crosswise model is an indirect questioning technique designed to control for socially desirable responding. Although the technique has delivered promising results in terms of improved validity in survey studies of sensitive issues, recent studies have indicated that the crosswise model may sometimes produce false positives. Hence, we investigated whether an insufficient understanding of the crosswise model instructions might be responsible for these false positives and whether ensuring a deeper understanding of the model and surveying more highly educated respondents reduces the problem of false positives. To this end, we experimentally manipulated the amount of information respondents received in the crosswise model instructions. We compared a crosswise model condition with only brief instructions and a crosswise model condition with detailed instructions and additional comprehension checks. Additionally, we compared the validity of crosswise model estimates between a higher- and a lower-educated subgroup of respondents. Our results indicate that false positives among highly educated respondents can be reduced when detailed instructions and comprehension checks are employed. Since false positives can also occur in direct questioning, they do not appear to be a specific flaw of the crosswise model, but rather a more general problem of self-reports on sensitive topics. False negatives were found to occur for all questioning techniques, but were less prevalent in the crosswise model than in the direct questioning condition. We highlight the importance of comprehension checks when applying indirect questioning and emphasize the necessity of developing instructions suitable for lower-educated respondents."
https://openalex.org/W3038656017,"Many high-risk conditions of pregnancy are undetected until the time of delivery in low-income countries. We developed a point-of-care ultrasound training protocol for providers in rural Uganda to detect fetal distress or demise, malpresentation, multiple gestation, placenta previa, oligohydramnios and preterm delivery. This was a mixed-methods study to evaluate the 2-week training curriculum and trainees' ability to perform a standard scanning protocol and interpret ultrasound images. Surveys to assess provider confidence were administered pre-training, immediately after, and at 3-month follow up. Following lecture and practical demonstrations, each trainee conducted 25 proctored scans and were required to pass an observed structured clinical exam (OSCE). All images produced 8 weeks post course underwent blinded review by two ultrasound experts to assess image quality and to identify common errors. Key informant interviews further assessed perceptions of the training program and utility of point-of-care ultrasound. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and reviewed by multiple readers using a content analysis approach. Twenty-three nurse/nurse midwives and two physicians from one district hospital and three health centers participated in the training curriculum. Confidence levels increased from an average of 1 point pre-course to over 6 points post-course for all measures (maximum of 7 points). Of 25 participants, 22 passed the OSCE on the first attempt (average score 89.4%). Image quality improved over time; the final error rate at week 8 was less than 5%, with an overall kappa of 0.8–1 for all measures between the two reviewers. Among the 12 key informant interviews conducted, key themes included a desire for more hands-on training and longer duration of training and challenges in balancing clinical duties with ability to attend training sessions. This study demonstrates that providers without previous ultrasound experience can detect high-risk conditions during labor with a high rate of quality and accuracy after training."
https://openalex.org/W3039773485,"The 2010 Deepwater Horizon blowout off the coast of Louisiana caused the largest marine oil spill on record. Samples were collected 2–3 months after the Macondo well was capped to assess damage to macrofauna and meiofauna communities. An earlier analysis of 58 stations demonstrated severe and moderate damage to an area of 148 km2. An additional 58 archived stations have been analyzed to enhance the resolution of that assessment and determine if impacts occurred further afield. Impacts included high levels of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the sediment, low diversity, low evenness, and low taxonomic richness of the infauna communities. High nematode to copepod ratios corroborated the severe disturbance of meiofauna communities. Additionally, barium levels near the wellhead were very high because of drilling activities prior to the accident. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to summarize oil spill impacts at stations near the Macondo well, and the benthic footprint of the DWH oil spill was estimated using Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) interpolation. An area of approximately 263 km2 around the wellhead was affected, which is 78% higher than the original estimate. Particularly severe damages to benthic communities were found in an area of 58 km2, which is 142% higher than the original estimate. The addition of the new stations extended the area of the benthic footprint map to about twice as large as originally thought and improved the resolution of the spatial interpolation. In the future, increasing the spatial extent of sampling should be a top priority for designing assessment studies."
https://openalex.org/W3039786529,"Background Short sleep duration has been suggested to lead to insulin resistance both directly by altering glucose metabolism and indirectly through obesity. This study aims to investigate associations between nocturnal sleep duration and insulin resistance considering abdominal obesity as a mediator. Methods We analysed data of 3 900 children aged 2–15 years participating in the second (2009/10) and third (2013/14) examination wave of the European IDEFICS/I.Family study (hereafter referred to as baseline and follow-up). Information on nocturnal sleep duration was collected by questionnaires and age-standardised (SLEEP z-score). The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was calculated from fasting insulin and fasting glucose obtained from blood samples; waist circumference (WAIST) was measured with an inelastic tape. HOMA and WAIST were used as indicators for insulin resistance and abdominal obesity, respectively, and transformed to age- and sex-specific z-scores. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between SLEEP z-score and HOMA z-score were investigated based on a path model considering WAIST z-score as a mediator adjusting for relevant confounders. Results Cross-sectionally, baseline SLEEP z-score was negatively associated with baseline WAIST z-score (unstandardised effect estimate -0.120, 95% confidence interval [-0.167; -0.073]). We observed no direct effect of baseline SLEEP z-score on baseline HOMA z-score but a negative indirect effect through baseline WAIST z-score (-0.042 [-0.058; -0.025]). Longitudinally, there was no direct effect of baseline SLEEP z-score on HOMA z-score at follow-up but a negative indirect effect through both baseline WAIST z-score and WAIST z-score at follow-up (-0.028 [-0.040; -0.016]). Conclusions Our results do not support the hypothesis of an association between short sleep duration and insulin resistance independent of abdominal obesity. However, longer sleep duration may exert short and long term beneficial effects on insulin resistance through its beneficial effects on abdominal obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3038279886,"The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a six-week, twice weekly resistance training (4 sets at 30% 1-RM until failure) with practical blood flow restriction (BFR) using 7cm wide cuffs with a twist lock placed below the patella is superior to training without BFR (NoBFR) concerning muscle mass and strength gains in calf muscles. A two-group (BFR n = 12, mean age 27.33 (7.0) years, training experience 7.3 (7.0) years; NoBFR n = 9, mean age 28.9 (7.4) years, training experience 7.1 (6.6) years) randomized matched pair design based on initial 1-RM was used to assess the effects on structural and functional adaptations in healthy males (Perometer calf volume [CV], gastrocnemius muscle thickness using ultrasound [MT], 7-maximal hopping test for leg stiffness [LS], 1-RM smith machine calf raise [1-RM], and visual analogue scale as a measure of pain intensity [VAS]). The mean number of repetitions completed per training session across the intervention period was higher in the NoBFR group compared to the BFR group (70 (16) vs. 52 (9), p = 0.002). VAS measured during the first session increased similarly in both groups from first to fourth set (p<0.001). No group effects or time×group interactions were found for CV, MT, LS, and 1-RM. However, there were significant time effects for MT (BFR +0.07 cm; NoBFR +0.04; p = 0.008), and 1-RM (BFR +40 kg; NoBFR +34 kg; p<0.001). LS and CV remained unchanged through training. VAS in both groups were similar, and BFR and NoBFR were equally effective for increasing 1-RM and MT in trained males. However, BFR was more time efficient, due to lesser repetition per training session."
https://openalex.org/W3038776833,"High rates of pre-treatment loss to care among persons diagnosed with HIV persist. Linkage to care can be improved through active digitally-based surveillance. Currently, record-keeping for HIV diagnoses in South Africa is paper-based. Aggregated testing data are reported routinely, and only discordant findings result in a specimen being tested at a laboratory and digitised. The Western Cape Province in South Africa has a Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) where person-level routine electronic data are consolidated in a single database, leveraging the existence of a unique patient identifier. To facilitate improved HIV surveillance, a pre-carbonated point-of-care test (PoCT) form was piloted, where one copy was routed to a central point and digitised for PHDC inclusion.We evaluated the utility of the intervention using cross-sectional and retrospective cohort analyses, as well as comparisons with aggregate data. Data were linked to the Patient Master Index of the PHDC using unique identifiers. Prior evidences of HIV within the PHDC were used to differentiate newly diagnosed patients and those retesting, as well as linkage to care and treatment.From May 2017 to June 2018, 11337 digitised point-of-care HIV testing records were linked to the PHDC. Overall, 96% of records in the aggregate dataset were digitised, with 97% linked to the PHDC. Of those tested, 79% were female (median age 27 years). Linkage demonstrated that 51.3% (95% CI 48.4-54.1%) of patients testing HIV-positive were retesting. Of those newly diagnosed, 81% (95% CI 77.9-84.3%) were linked to HIV care and 25% (95% CI 21.6-28.7%) were initiated on antiretroviral therapy immediately.Digitisation of PoCT results provides individuated HIV testing data to assist in linkage to care and in differentiating newly diagnosed patients from positive patients retesting. Actionable and accurate data can improve the measurement of performance towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets."
https://openalex.org/W3038410518,"The brown planthopper (Nilapavata lugens: BPH) and whitebacked planthopper (Sogatella furcifera: WBPH) co-occur as the principal pests of rice in Asia. A review of previous studies suggests that the two species have similar temperature tolerances and similar temperature thresholds for development. However, the distribution and seasonality of WBPH suggest that its temperature optima for performance (survival, oviposition and growth) may be lower than for BPH. We compared adult longevity, oviposition, nymph survival and development success, as well as nymph biomass in both species across a gradient of constant temperatures from 15°C-40°C, at 5°C intervals. The most suitable temperatures for oviposition, nymph biomass and development success were 5–10°C lower for WBPH than for BPH. Furthermore, compared to BPH, WBPH demonstrated clear differences in oviposition on different rice subspecies and on rice at different growth stages at 25°C and 30°C, but not at other temperatures. The results suggest that aspects of herbivore performance within tolerable temperature ranges, which are not often included in temperature models, may be more useful than thermal tolerances or development thresholds in predicting the effects of global warming on pest damage to crops."
https://openalex.org/W3039129731,"Documenting changes in ecosystem extent and protection is essential to understanding status of biodiversity and related ecosystem services and have direct applications to measuring Essential Biodiversity Variables, Targets under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and IUCN Red List of Ecosystems. We developed both potential and current distribution maps of terrestrial ecosystem types for the temperate and tropical Americas; with “potential” estimating where a type would likely occur today had there not been prior land conversion for modern land uses. We utilized a hierarchical classification to describe and map natural ecosystem types at six levels of thematic detail, with lower thematic levels defining more units each with narrower floristic range than upper levels. Current land use/land cover was derived using available global data on human land use intensity and combined with the potential distribution maps to estimate long-term change in extent for each ecosystem type. We also assessed representation of ecosystem types within protected areas as defined by IUCN I-VI land status categories. Of the 749 ecosystem types assessed, represented at 5th (n = 315) vs. 6th (n = 433) levels of the classification hierarchy, 5 types (1.6%) and 31 types (7.1%), respectively, have lost >90% of their potential extent. Some 66 types (20.9%) and 141 types (32.5%), respectively, have lost >50% of their potential extent; thus, crossing thresholds of Vulnerable status under IUCN Red List criterion A3. For ecosystem type representation within IUCN protected area classes, with reference to potential extent of each type, 111 (45.3%) and 125 (28.8%) of types, respectively, have higher representation (>17%) than CBD 2020 targets. Twelve types (3.8%) and 23 (5.3%) of types, respectively, are represented with <1% within protected areas. We illustrate an option for visualizing and reporting on CBD targets (2020 and proposed post-2020) for ecosystem representativeness using both potential extent as a baseline."
https://openalex.org/W3039379139,"Hydroxynitrile lyases (HNL's) belonging to the α/β-hydrolase-fold superfamily evolved from esterases approximately 100 million years ago. Reconstruction of an ancestral hydroxynitrile lyase in the α/β-hydrolase fold superfamily yielded a catalytically active hydroxynitrile lyase, HNL1. Several properties of HNL1 differ from the modern HNL from rubber tree (HbHNL). HNL1 favors larger substrates as compared to HbHNL, is two-fold more catalytically promiscuous for ester hydrolysis (p-nitrophenyl acetate) as compared to mandelonitrile cleavage, and resists irreversible heat inactivation to 35 °C higher than for HbHNL. We hypothesized that the x-ray crystal structure of HNL1 may reveal the molecular basis for the differences in these properties. The x-ray crystal structure solved to 1.96-Å resolution shows the expected α/β-hydrolase fold, but a 60% larger active site as compared to HbHNL. This larger active site echoes its evolution from esterases since related esterase SABP2 from tobacco also has a 38% larger active site than HbHNL. The larger active site in HNL1 likely accounts for its ability to accept larger hydroxynitrile substrates. Site-directed mutagenesis of HbHNL to expand the active site increased its promiscuous esterase activity 50-fold, consistent with the larger active site in HNL1 being the primary cause of its promiscuous esterase activity. Urea-induced unfolding of HNL1 indicates that it unfolds less completely than HbHNL (m-value = 0.63 for HNL1 vs 0.93 kcal/mol·M for HbHNL), which may account for the ability of HNL1 to better resist irreversible inactivation upon heating. The structure of HNL1 shows changes in hydrogen bond networks that may stabilize regions of the folded structure."
https://openalex.org/W3040476325,"Hepatitis C elimination will require widespread access to treatment and responses at the health-service level to increase testing among populations at risk. We explored changes in hepatitis C testing and the cascade of care before and after the introduction of direct-acting antiviral treatments in Victoria, Australia.De-identified clinical data were retrospectively extracted from eighteen primary care clinics providing services targeted towards people who inject drugs. We explored hepatitis C testing within three-year periods immediately prior to (pre-DAA period) and following (post-DAA period) universal access to DAA treatments on 1st March 2016. Among ever RNA-positive individuals, we constructed two care cascades at the end of the pre-DAA and post-DAA periods.The number of individuals HCV-tested was 13,784 (12.2% of those with a consultation) in the pre-DAA period and 14,507 (10.4% of those with a consultation) in the post-DAA period. The pre-DAA care cascade included 2,515 RNA-positive individuals; 1,977 (78.6%) were HCV viral load/genotype tested; 19 (0.8%) were prescribed treatment; and 12 had evidence of cure (0.5% of those RNA-positive and 63.6% of those eligible for cure). The post-DAA care cascade included 3,713 RNA-positive individuals; 3,276 (88.2%) were HCV viral load/genotype tested; 1,674 (45.1%) were prescribed treatment; and 863 had evidence of cure (23.2% of those RNA-positive and 94.9% of those eligible for cure).Marked improvements in the cascade of hepatitis C care among patients attending primary care clinics were observed following the universal access of DAA treatments in Australia, although improvements in testing were less pronounced."
https://openalex.org/W3040621387,"High quality census data are not always available in developing countries. Instead, mobile phone data are becoming a popular proxy to evaluate the density, activity and social characteristics of a population. They offer additional advantages: they are updated in real-time, include mobility information and record visitors' activity. However, we show with the example of Senegal that the direct correlation between the average phone activity and both the population density and the nighttime lights intensity may be insufficiently high to provide an accurate representation of the situation. There are reasons to expect this, such as the heterogeneity of the market share or the particular granularity of the distribution of cell towers. In contrast, we present a method based on the daily, weekly and yearly phone activity curves and on the network characteristics of the mobile phone data, that allows to estimate more accurately such information without compromising people's privacy. This information can be vital for development and infrastructure planning. In particular, this method could help to reduce significantly the logistic costs of data collection in the particularly budget-constrained context of developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3039052465,"Chronic kidney disease is a common disease in dogs, and factors such as serum concentrations of creatinine, albumin, and phosphorus at the moment of diagnosis may influence the survival of these patients. The present retrospective study aimed to evaluate the relationship between survival in dogs with chronic kidney disease and laboratory parameters (creatinine, phosphorus, albumin, and hematocrit) and nutritional parameters (body condition score, muscle mass score, type of food, appetite and feeding method). A total of 116 dogs with chronic kidney disease stages 2 to 4 were included, and survival was calculated considering the time between diagnosis and death. Survival curves were configurated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and a comparison between survival curves was performed by the log-rank test. Factors related to survival were disease stage (p<0.0001), serum phosphorus concentration (p = 0.0005), hematocrit (0.0001), body condition score (p = 0.0391), muscle mass score (p = 0.0002), type of food (p = 0.0009), feeding method (p<0.0001) and appetite (p = 0.0007). Based on data obtained in this study, it is possible to conclude that early diagnosis, as well as nutritional evaluation and renal diet intake, are determinant strategies to increase survival in dogs with chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W3039767490,"Urban development relies on many factors to remain viable, including infrastructure, services, and government provisions and subsidies. However, in situations involving federal or state level policy, development responds not just to one regulatory signal, but also to multiple signals from overlapping and competing jurisdictions. The 1982 U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CoBRA) offers an opportunity to study when and how development restrictions and economic disincentives protect natural resources by stopping or slowing urban development in management regimes with distributed authority and responsibility. CoBRA prohibits federal financial assistance for infrastructure, post-storm disaster relief, and flood insurance in designated sections (CoBRA units) of coastal barriers. How has CoBRA's removal of these subsidies affected rates and types of urban development? Using building footprint and real estate data (n = 1,385,552 parcels), we compare density of built structures, land use types, residential house size, and land values within and outside of CoBRA units in eight Southeast and Gulf Coast states. We show that CoBRA is associated with reduced development rates in designated coastal barriers. We also demonstrate how local responses may counteract withdrawal of federal subsidies. As attention increases towards improving urban resilience in high hazard areas, this work contributes to understanding how limitations on infrastructure and insurance subsidies can affect outcomes where overlapping jurisdictions have competing goals."
https://openalex.org/W3040160289,"Killing people is universally considered reprehensible and evokes in observers a need to punish perpetrators. Here, we explored how observers’ personality is associated with their cognitive, emotional, and punishing reactions towards perpetrators using data from 1,004 participants who responded to a set of fifteen third-party perspective moral dilemmas. Among those, four scenarios (architect, life boat, footbridge, smother for dollars) describing deliberate killings were compared to investigate the role of the content features “motive for killing” (selfish vs. utilitarian) and “evitability of victims’ death”. Participants’ moral appropriateness ratings, emotions towards perpetrators, and assigned punishments revealed complex scenario-personality interactions. Trait psychopathy was associated with harsher punishments in all scenarios but also with less concern about killing in general, an increased moral appreciation of utilitarian motives for killing, and a reduced concern about the killing of avoidable victims. Need for cognition was associated with considering a utilitarian motive for killing as a mitigating factor, while intuitive/authority-obedient thinking was linked to a strong focus on avoidability of harm as an aggravating factor when assigning punishments. Other-oriented empathy, trait anxiety, and justice sensitivity did not account for differences in third-party punishments. Our explorative findings highlight the importance of inter-individual differences for moral decision making and sense of justice."
https://openalex.org/W3038500448,"Background Neonatal septicemia is a life threatening medical emergency that requires timely detection of pathogens with urgent rational antibiotics therapy. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2017 to September 2018 among 317 septicemia suspected neonates at neonatal intensive care unit, Ayder Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Mekelle, Tigray, North Ethiopia. A 3 mL of blood was collected from each participant. Identification of bacterial species was done using the standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic sensitivity test was done using disk diffusion method. Data were entered and analyzed using computer software SPSS version 22. Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis was applied to determine the association between variables. Results Of the 317 (190 male and 127 female) neonates, 116 (36.6%) were found to be with culture proven septicemia. Klebsiella species were the predominant etiologic agents. Length of hospital stay (AOR (adjusted odds ratio) = 3.65 (2.17–6.13), p < 0.001) and low birth weight (AOR = 1.64 (1.13–2.78), p = 0.04) were the factors associated with neonatalsepticemia. Most isolates showeda frightening drug resistance rate to the commonly used antimicrobial drugs. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Enterobacter and Citrobacter species were 57% to100% resistant to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, gentamycin, amoxacillin-clavulunic acid and ampicillin. All, 9 (100%) isolates of S. aureus were resistant to oxacilline, ampicillin,erythromycin and gentamycin. Furthermore, 55.6% S. aureus isolates were Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusion Neonaltal septicemia is found to be significantly high in the present study. As most of the isolates are potentially related to hospital acquired infections, prevention and control policy should have to be more strengthening in the neonatal intensive care unit."
https://openalex.org/W3039316514,"Indirect reciprocity is one of the major mechanisms in the evolution of human cooperation. In indirect reciprocity, social norms with which individuals distinguish good people from bad people play essential roles. Despite extensive studies on the evolution of cooperation in indirect reciprocity, little is known about which social norms people actually adopt. Here we reveal what kind of norms are adopted by people in indirect reciprocal situations in daily life by using scenario-based experiments. The results showed that people evaluated “justified defection” as neither good nor bad and withheld their evaluation. Theoretically, social norms that evaluate justified defection as good are required for cooperation to be stable. However, the norm that people actually adopted deviates from the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate the necessity to reconsider the justification of “justified defection” in the evolution of cooperation."
https://openalex.org/W3039066200,"Toxin-antitoxin systems (TAS) are commonly found on bacterial plasmids and are generally involved in plasmid maintenance. In addition to plasmid maintenance, several plasmid-mediated TAS are also involved in bacterial stress response and virulence. Even though the same TAS are present in a variety of plasmid types and bacterial species, differences in their sequences, expression and functions are not well defined. Here, we aimed to identify commonly occurring plasmid TAS in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and compare the sequence, expression and plasmid stability function of their variants. 27 putative type II TAS were identified from 1063 plasmids of Klebsiella pneumoniae in GenBank. Among these, ccdAB and pemIK were found to be most common, also occurring in plasmids of E. coli. Comparisons of ccdAB variants, taken from E. coli and K. pneumoniae, revealed sequence differences, while pemIK variants from IncF and IncL/M plasmids were almost identical. Similarly, the expression and plasmid stability functions of ccdAB variants varied according to the host strain and species, whereas the expression and functions of pemIK variants were consistent among host strains. The specialised functions of some TAS may determine the host specificity and epidemiology of major antibiotic resistance plasmids."

This study examined whether or not PLHIV in prison might be willing to participate in assisted HIV partner notification services and their reasons for and against disclosing their HIV-positive status to their partners. PLHIV (n = 150) recruited from Jakarta’s two largest all-male prisons completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire collecting demographic and risk behavior data, and attitudes toward HIV disclosure and partner services. Among those who were sexually active and/or injecting drugs before incarceration, two-thirds (66.4%, 91/137) endorsed provider referral as an acceptable way to notify their sex partners, and nearly three quarters (72.4%, 89/123) endorsed provider referral to notify their drug-injecting partners. Only a quarter (25.1%) of participants reported that their main sex partner had ever received an HIV test. Participants with anticipated stigma were less likely to endorse provider referral for sex partners (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.96) and drug-injecting partners (aOR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 1.00). Relationship closeness was associated with higher odds of endorsing provider referral for drug-injecting partners (aOR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.25, 3.45). Protecting partners from infection and a moral duty to inform were main reasons to disclose, while stigma and privacy concerns were main reasons not to disclose. Most incarcerated PLHIV have at-risk partners in the community who they would be willing to notify if provided with assistance. Assisted partner notification for prison populations offers a promising public health approach to accelerate diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of HIV infection in the community, particularly among women."
https://openalex.org/W3038173783,"Oceans absorb a huge part of the atmospheric heat, leading to the rise in water temperature. Reefs are among the most affected ecosystems, where the complex behavioral repertoire of fishes is usually an indicator of environmental impacts. Here, we examined whether temperature (28 and 34°C) and habitat complexity (high and low) interact to affect the agonistic behavior (mirror test) of the dusky damselfish (Stegastes fuscus), a key species in Brazilian reefs because of its gardening capacity and territorial behavior. Higher temperatures altered basal behavior in both high and low-complexity conditions. Fish kept at 28°C under the high-complexity condition were more aggressive than those at a higher temperature (34°C) and in a low-complexity condition, which also exhibited lower dispersion. Our data show that changes in behavior of coral reef fish is associated to fluctuations in environmental conditions. Thus, it is important to implement management or conservation strategies that could mitigate global change effects."
https://openalex.org/W3040557429,"Background Access to outpatient therapeutic feeding programs for all children who had uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in need is a global health priority. In Ethiopia SAM is treated in hospitals, health centers and health posts. Health extension workers (HEWs) manage SAM that is uncomplicated at the health posts through the outpatient therapeutic feeding programs (OTP). Identifying predictors that predict time-to-recovery of children on OTP is thus vital to optimizing therapeutic success. However, the factors affecting children’s’ recovery time at this peripheral health institutions were not well documented. Therefore, this study aimed to identify predictors of time-to-recovery from SAM among children treated at an OTP in health posts of Arba Minch Zuria woreda, Gamo Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 402 children enrolled in an OTP in the health posts of Arba Minch Zuria woreda based on data abstracted from their medical records. The study children were selected using systematic random sampling method using a list of their medical record numbers. Both descriptive and analytic analyses were performed. Median time of recovery was estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Furthermore, bivariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to identify factors significantly associated with outcome variable. Result The median time-to-recovery from severe acute malnutrition among children was 49 days (Interquartile range [IQR]: 42–56). Among the participants, 70.40% with 95% CI: (74.2–85.0%) recovered from severe acute malnutrition. The Cox-proportional hazard analysis showed that children’s age at admission (Adjusted hazards ratio [AHR] = 3.15; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.85, 5.03), diagnosis with edema (AHR = 1.75, 95%CI: (1.27, 2.43), co-morbidity of diarrhea (AHR = 0.22, 95% CI(0.13, 0.39), and anemia (AHR = 0.64, 95% CI:(0.42, 0.98) were found to be predictors of time to recovery from SAM. Conclusions The median time-to-recovery at the health posts in this study was in the accepted time period for the maximum Ethiopian standard protocol set for the management of SAM. However, the nutritional recovery rate was lower than the minimum acceptable threshold for the Sphere International Standards. Therefore, early screening of co-morbidity like diarrhea, anemia and edemaand timely intervention would increase the chance of recovery of children."

https://openalex.org/W3040439417,"The sodium (Na+)-chloride cotransporter (NCC) expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) is a key molecule regulating urinary Na+ and potassium (K+) excretion. We previously reported that high-K+ load rapidly dephosphorylated NCC and promoted urinary K+ excretion in mouse kidneys. This effect was inhibited by calcineurin (CaN) and calmodulin inhibitors. However, the detailed mechanism through which high-K+ signal results in CaN activation remains unknown. We used Flp-In NCC HEK293 cells and mice to evaluate NCC phosphorylation. We analyzed intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]in) using live cell Ca2+ imaging in HEK293 cells. We confirmed that high-K+-induced NCC dephosphorylation was not observed without CaN using Flp-In NCC HEK29 cells. Extracellular Ca2+ reduction with a Ca2+ chelator inhibited high-K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]in and NCC dephosphorylation. We focused on Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) 1, a bidirectional regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ expressed in DCT. We identified that NCX1 suppression with a specific inhibitor (SEA0400) or siRNA knockdown inhibited K+-induced increase in [Ca2+]in and NCC dephosphorylation. In a mouse study, SEA0400 treatment inhibited K+-induced NCC dephosphorylation. SEA0400 reduced urinary K+ excretion and induced hyperkalemia. Here, we identified NCX1 as a key molecule in urinary K+ excretion promoted by CaN activation and NCC dephosphorylation in response to K+ load."
https://openalex.org/W3038958977,"A gene regulatory network can be described at a high level by a directed graph with signed edges, and at a more detailed level by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The former qualitatively models the causal regulatory interactions between ordered pairs of genes, while the latter quantitatively models the time-varying concentrations of mRNA and proteins. This paper clarifies the connection between the two types of models. We propose a property, called the constant sign property, for a general class of ODE models. The constant sign property characterizes the set of conditions (system parameters, external signals, or internal states) under which an ODE model is consistent with a signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model holds globally for all conditions, then the ODE model has a single signed, directed graph. If the constant sign property for an ODE model only holds locally, which may be more typical, then the ODE model corresponds to different graphs under different sets of conditions. In addition, two versions of constant sign property are given and a relationship between them is proved. As an example, the ODE models that capture the effect of cis-regulatory elements involving protein complex binding, based on the model in the GeneNetWeaver source code, are described in detail and shown to satisfy the global constant sign property with a unique consistent gene regulatory graph. Even a single gene regulatory graph is shown to have many ODE models of GeneNetWeaver type consistent with it due to combinatorial complexity and continuous parameters. Finally the question of how closely data generated by one ODE model can be fit by another ODE model is explored. It is observed that the fit is better if the two models come from the same graph."

Although osteopathic manual therapy (OMT) is used predominantly to treat other pathologies, certain OMT techniques have been shown to improve patients’ respiratory function. Objectives The aim of this study was to assess the influence of osteopathic techniques on breathing. Methods Tests were performed with the use of a spirometer and the results were expressed as Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), and Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). Thirty healthy males and females between the age of 18 and 50 took part in the research. Fifteen individuals were randomly assigned to the experimental group and fifteen persons were assigned to the placebo group. The participants from the experimental group were treated with such osteopathic techniques aimed at the pulmonary system as the thoracic thrust (manipulations of vertebral joints and ribs), the sternal pump technique and stretching of the diaphragm. The placebo group was treated with soft tissue therapy (STT) techniques for the masseter muscle. Results The described set of osteopathic techniques exerts an influence on PEF in healthy individuals; however, it does not affect FVC and FEV1. Conclusion Osteopathic techniques do not seem to improve lung health, as reflected in FEV1 and FVC, but they improve the respiratory function aspects reflected by PEF in the participants without any history of lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W3039655957,"Background and objectives Hospital readmissions are a frequent complication of pneumonia. Most data regarding readmissions are obtained from the United States, whereas few data are available from the European healthcare utilization (HCU) systems. In a large cohort of Italian patients with a previous hospitalization for pneumonia, our aim was to evaluate the incidence and predictors of early readmissions due to pneumonia. Methods This is a observational retrospective, population based, cohort study. Data were retrieved from the HCU databases of the Italian Lombardy region. 203,768 patients were hospitalized for pneumonia between 2003 and 2012. The outcome was the first rehospitalization for pneumonia. The patients were followed up after the index hospital admission to estimate the hazard ratio, and relative 95% confidence interval, of the outcome associated with the risk factors that we had identified. Results 7,275 patients (3.6%) had an early pneumonia readmission. Male gender, age ≥70 years, length of stay of the first admission and a higher burden of comorbidities were significantly associated with the outcome. Chronic use of antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, glucocorticoids and drugs for obstructive airway diseases were also more frequently prescribed in patients requiring rehospitalization. Previous use of inhaled broncodilators, including both beta2-agonists and anticholinergics, but not inhaled steroids, were associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission. Conclusions Frail elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and complex drug regimens were at higher risk of early rehospitalization and, thus, may require closer follow-up and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3039695586,"Alluvial floodplain forests have been reduced drastically in many parts of Europe, due to deforestation, the transformation to settlement and expansion of agricultural areas. Although they have been heavily modified for centuries, generalized frameworks for their management are scarce and the complex interactions between the physical environment and biological processes are often not fully understood. As the zonation of woody species in floodplains is mainly determined by hydrological conditions, flooding tolerance can be regarded as a key factor for the successful establishment of woody species. Furthermore, the oxygen level of the flooding water might affect the responses to flooding. We examined the influence of flooding duration in combination with oxygen supply by aeration on the foliar injury and growth of six-week-old saplings of ten woody species, under controlled common garden conditions. Six of them are considered to be flooding tolerant whereas four are intolerant. In addition, seven are native whereas three are non-native species. During the experiment, the saplings were exposed to partial flooding of different durations (k = 3; three, six and nine weeks) and oxygen levels (k = 2; aerated and not aerated). For comparison, we included an unflooded control. We recorded foliar injury, plant height, number of leaves and stem diameter. We also included a long-term recovery period. Whereas foliar injury decreased for most species with increasing flooding duration, the typical floodplain forest species, classified as flooding tolerant developed better. The differences in species response to flooding could be most likely explained by their ability to react to the resulting stress in morphological, physiological and metabolic terms irrespective whether they are native or not. In addition, the inclusion of a recovery period seems to be important for the assessment of flooding tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3040036677,"The secondary structure prediction of proteins is a classic topic of computational structural biology with a variety of applications. During the past decade, the accuracy of prediction achieved by state-of-the-art algorithms has been >80%; meanwhile, the time cost of prediction increased rapidly because of the exponential growth of fundamental protein sequence data. Based on literature studies and preliminary observations on the relationships between the size/homology of the fundamental protein dataset and the speed/accuracy of predictions, we raised two hypotheses that might be helpful to determine the main influence factors of the efficiency of secondary structure prediction. Experimental results of size and homology reductions of the fundamental protein dataset supported those hypotheses. They revealed that shrinking the size of the dataset could substantially cut down the time cost of prediction with a slight decrease of accuracy, which could be increased on the contrary by homology reduction of the dataset. Moreover, the Shannon information entropy could be applied to explain how accuracy was influenced by the size and homology of the dataset. Based on these findings, we proposed that a proper combination of size and homology reductions of the protein dataset could speed up the secondary structure prediction while preserving the high accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms. Testing the proposed strategy with the fundamental protein dataset of the year 2018 provided by the Universal Protein Resource, the speed of prediction was enhanced over 20 folds while all accuracy measures remained equivalently high. These findings are supposed helpful for improving the efficiency of researches and applications depending on the secondary structure prediction of proteins. To make future implementations of the proposed strategy easy, we have established a database of size and homology reduced protein datasets at http://10.life.nctu.edu.tw/UniRefNR."

https://openalex.org/W3040200606,"To investigate how neediness and identifiability of a recipient influence the willingness of a donor to invest resources in charity-like lotteries we propose a new game, called ‘need game’. Similar to the dictator game, the need game includes two players, one active player (the donor or dictator) and one passive player (the recipient). Both players require a minimum need (ND and NR), expressed in terms of points. The donor is endowed with KD points and must retain at least ND points, i.e., the need, with ND < KD, at the end of the game with n rounds. The recipient starts with KR points and must end the game with at least NR points, i.e., the need, with KR < NR < KD. The donor is asked to choose one of three different amounts from KD to place a bet on a lottery. If won, the gain is added to the endowment. If lost, the recipient receives the points. The recipient is paid only when his/her need threshold is obtained; likewise the donor gets paid only when his/her need threshold is maintained. The main focus here is on need of both players (ND = NR = 2, 200, and ND = NR = 0 serving as baseline control) and the identifiability of the recipient (no information, described by text and picture, and physical presence). We probe whether the amount invested by the donor depends on need and identifiability of the recipient. In addition, we include the framing of the game as gain or loss, different probabilities to win/lose, and different time limits as covariates. We found that each of these factors can play a role when investing in charity-like lotteries."

A method to predict which individuals might be more susceptible to injury would be valuable, especially in the military where basic recruits may be discharged from service due to injury. We postulate that certain body characteristics may be used to predict risk of injury with physical activity.US Army basic training recruits between the ages of 17 and 21 (N = 17,680, 28% female) were scanned for uniform fitting using the 3D body imaging scanner, Human Solutions of North America at Fort Jackson, SC. From the 3D body imaging scans, a database consisting of 161 anthropometric measurements per basic training recruit was used to predict the probability of discharge from the US Army due to injury. Predictions were made using logistic regression, random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Model comparison was done using the area under the curve (AUC) of a ROC curve.The ANN model outperformed two other models, (ANN, AUC = 0.70, [0.68,0.72], logistic regression AUC = 0.67, [0.62,0.72], random forest AUC = 0.65, [0.61,0.70]).Body shape profiles generated from a three-dimensional body scanning imaging in military personnel predicted dischargeable physical injury. The ANN model can be programmed into the scanner to deliver instantaneous predictions of risk, which may provide an opportunity to intervene to prevent injury."
https://openalex.org/W3038345739,"Objective Most women live to experience menopause and will spend 4–8 years transitioning from fertile age to full menstrual stop. Biologically, reproductive ageing is a continuous process, but by convention, it is defined categorically as pre-, peri- and postmenopause; categories that are sometimes supported by measurements of sex hormones in blood samples. We aimed to develop and validate a new tool, a reproductive ageing score (RAS), that could give a simple and yet precise description of the status of reproductive ageing, without hormone measurements, to be used by health professionals and researchers. Methods Questionnaire data on age, menstrual regularity and menstrual frequency was provided by the large multicentre population-based RHINE cohort. A continuous reproductive ageing score was developed from these variables, using techniques of fuzzy mathematics, to generate a decimal number ranging from 0.00 (nonmenopausal) to 1.00 (postmenopausal). The RAS was then validated with sex hormone measurements (follicle stimulating hormone and 17β-estradiol) and interview-data provided by the large population-based ECRHS cohort, using receiver-operating characteristics (ROC). Results The RAS, developed from questionnaire data of the RHINE cohort, defined with high precision and accuracy the menopausal status as confirmed by interview and hormone data in the ECRHS cohort. The area under the ROC curve was 0.91 (95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.90–0.93) to distinguish nonmenopausal women from peri- and postmenopausal women, and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83–0.88) to distinguish postmenopausal women from nonmenopausal and perimenopausal women. Conclusions The RAS provides a useful and valid tool for describing the status of reproductive ageing accurately, on a continuous scale from 0.00 to 1.00, based on simple questions and without requiring blood sampling. The score allows for a more precise differentiation than the conventional categorisation in pre-, peri- and postmenopause. This is useful for epidemiological research and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3039571679,"Actin-interacting protein 1 (AIP1), also known as WD repeat-containing protein 1 (WDR1), is ubiquitous in eukaryotic organisms, and it plays critical roles in the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, the biological function and mechanism of AIP1 in mammalian oocyte maturation is still largely unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that AIP1 boosts ADF/Cofilin activity in mouse oocytes. AIP1 is primarily distributed around the spindle region during oocyte maturation, and its depletion impairs meiotic spindle migration and asymmetric division. The knockdown of AIP1 resulted in the gathering of a large number of actin-positive patches around the spindle region. This effect was reduced by human AIP1 (hAIP1) or Cofilin (S3A) expression. AIP1 knockdown also reduced the phosphorylation of Cofilin near the spindle, indicating that AIP1 interacts with ADF/Cofilin-decorated actin filaments and enhances filament disassembly. Moreover, the deletion of AIP1 disrupts Cofilin localization in metaphase I (MI) and induces cytokinesis defects in metaphase II (MII). Taken together, our results provide evidence that AIP1 promotes actin dynamics and cytokinesis via Cofilin in the gametes of female mice."
https://openalex.org/W3040328602,"Cellular stress response mechanisms normally function to enhance survival and allow for cells to return to homeostasis following an adverse event. Cancer cells often co-opt these same mechanisms as a means to evade apoptosis and mitigate a state of constant cellular stress. Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) is upregulated under diverse stress conditions and is overexpressed in a variety of cancers. It was demonstrated ATF5 is a survival factor in transformed, but not normal cells. However, the regulation of ATF5 is not fully understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate miRNA regulation at the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of ATF5, with the goal of demonstrating a reversal of the upregulation of ATF5 induced under diverse cellular stress in cancer cells. A multifactorial approach using in silico analysis was employed to identify miRNAs 433-3p, 520b-3p, and 129-5p as potential regulators of ATF5, based on their predicted binding sites over the span of the ATF5 3’ UTR. Luciferase reporter assay data validated all three miRNA candidates by demonstrating direct binding to the target ATF5 3’. However, functional studies revealed miR-520b-3p as the sole candidate able to reverse the upregulation of ATF5 protein under diverse cellular stress. Additionally, miR-520b-3p levels were inversely related to ATF5 mRNA under endoplasmic reticulum stress and amino acid deprivation. This is the first evidence that regulation at the 3’ UTR is involved in modulating ATF5 levels under cellular stress and suggests an important role for miRNA-520b-3p in the regulation of ATF5."

https://openalex.org/W3040689039,"Refrigerated ready-to-eat (RTE) dips often have pH and water activity combinations conducive to the proliferation of foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes. This study conducted product assessments of five refrigerated RTE dips: baba ghanoush, guacamole, hummus, pesto, and tahini, along with individual dip components including avocado, basil, chickpeas, cilantro, eggplant, garlic, and jalapeno pepper. Dips and dip components were inoculated with 2 log CFU/g of L. monocytogenes and stored at 10°C for 28 days. The pathogen was enumerated throughout storage and growth rates were determined using the DMFit program to compute the time required for L. monocytogenes to achieve a 1 log CFU/g increase in population. Survival and growth rates varied significantly between the refrigerated RTE dips and dip components assessed in this study. For dips, L. monocytogenes progressively decreased in baba ghanoush, pesto, and tahini. In contrast, the pathogen proliferated in both hummus and guacamole and the highest growth rate was observed in guacamole (0.34±0.05 log CFU/g per day) resulting in a 1 log CFU/g increase in population in 7.8 days. L. monocytogenes proliferated in all dip components with the exception of eggplant and garlic. The pathogen achieved the highest growth rate in chickpeas (2.22±1.75 log CFU/g per day) resulting in a computed 1 log CFU/g increase in only 0.5 days. Results from this study can aid in understanding how L. monocytogenes behaves in refrigerated RTE dips and dip components and data can be utilized in understanding product formulations and in risk assessments."

Plethysmography, high-resolution high-frequency ultrasonography and clearance of an inulin analog were used to evaluate the arterial pressure and hemodynamic changes before and at days 7, 14 and 19 of gestation.Arterial pressure was higher (P<0.05) in rats with high than in those with normal (NFD) fat diet before pregnancy (123 ±3 and 110 ±3 mmHg, respectively) and only decreased at day 14 of gestation in rats with NFD (98±4 mmHg, P<0.05). A significant increment in stroke volume (42 ±10%) and cardiac output (51 ±12%) was found at day 19 of pregnancy in rats with NFD. The changes in stroke volume and cardiac output were similar in rats with NFD and HFD. When compared to the values obtained before pregnancy, a transitory elevation in renal blood flow was found at day 14 of pregnancy in both groups. However, glomerular filtration rate only increased (P<0.05) in rats with NFD at days 14 (20 ±7%) and 19 (27 ±8%) of gestation. The significant elevations of mean velocity, and velocity time integral throughout gestation in radial (127 ±26% and 111 ±23%, respectively) and uterine (91 ±16% and 111 ±25%, respectively) arteries of rats with NFD were not found in rats with an early and prolonged HFD.This study reports novel findings showing that the early and prolonged exposure to a HFD leads to a significant impairment in the renal, uterine and radial arteries hemodynamic changes associated to gestation."
https://openalex.org/W3038710984,"Conservation efforts are increasingly being challenged by a rapidly changing environment, and for some aquatic species the use of captive rearing or selective breeding is an attractive option. However, captivity itself can impose unintended artificial selection known as domestication selection (adaptation to culture conditions) and is relatively understudied for most marine species. To test for domestication selection in marine bivalves, we focused on a fitness-related trait (larval starvation resistance) that could be altered under artificial selection. Using larvae produced from a wild population of Crassostrea virginica and a selectively bred, disease-resistant line we measured growth and survival during starvation versus standard algal diet conditions. Larvae from both lineages showed a remarkable resilience to food limitation, possibly mediated by an ability to utilize dissolved organic matter for somatic maintenance. Water chemistry analysis showed dissolved organic carbon in filtered tank water to be at concentrations similar to natural river water. We observed that survival in larvae produced from the aquaculture line was significantly lower compared to larvae produced from wild broodstock (8 ± 3% and 21 ± 2%, respectively) near the end of a 10-day period with no food (phytoplankton). All larval cohorts had arrested growth and depressed respiration during the starvation period and took at least two days to recover once food was reintroduced before resuming growth. Respiration rate recovered rapidly and final shell length was similar between the two treatments Phenotypic differences between the wild and aquaculture lines suggest potential differences in the capacity to sustain extended food limitation, but this work requires replication with multiple selection lines and wild populations to make more general inferences about domestication selection. With this contribution we explore the potential for domestication selection in bivalves, discuss the physiological and fitness implications of reduced starvation tolerance, and aim to inspire further research on the topic."

Posterior vein wall injuries occurred in 66% using P-free, 60% using P-com, and 0% using P-sha (p< 0.01). There was no significant difference in the incidence of posterior vein wall injuries between P-free and P-com. Conclusions Use of a shallow angle of approach needle guide resulted in a lower rate of posterior vein injuries during venipuncture of a simulated vein compared with other techniques using a steeper angle techniques."

They were linked to the regulation of a multitude of cellular processes and pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, we show for the first time that two independent induction patterns for CREM repressor isoforms exist in the heart, namely for ICER and smICER (small ICER), which are induced in response to β-adrenergic stimulation in a transient- and saturation-like manner, respectively. This time-shifted induction pattern, driven by two internal promoters in the Crem gene, leads to the predominant transcription of smIcer after prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation. Using an ICER knockout mouse model with preserved smICER induction, we show that the transient-like induction of Icer itself has minor effects on gene regulation, cardiac hypertrophy or contractile function in the heart. We conclude that the functions previously linked to ICER may be rather attributed to smICER, also beyond the cardiac background."
https://openalex.org/W3040545739,"The core problem in the distribution dilemma is the trade-off between equity and efficiency. With the development of socio-economic conditions, the optimal decision changes between equitable and efficient options. The methods for nudging decision-makers to make optimal decisions without changing the event are extremely important. This study used two laboratory behavior experiments to explore the impact of maxim information on the trade-off between equity and efficiency. The study explores whether stake levels and division schemes affect the nudging effect of the maxim in a Trade-Off Game (TOG). We found that participants were affected by maxim information in decision-making scenarios, and participants showed different equity preferences as the maxim information changed, without relevance of the stake level. Additionally, the nudging effect of the maxim only exists under the condition that the distributor's interests is not affected."

Among IGRAs, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) results are highly variable, so the borderline zone has been proposed to reduce unnecessary LTBI treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the proportion of the borderline zone of QFT-GIT in healthcare workers' (HCWs) serial IGRA and to retrospectively identify the utility of predicting tuberculosis (TB) in a moderate TB incidence setting.The participants were HCWs who had undergone serial LTBI screening between June 2013 and June 2018. IGRA-positive HCWs underwent examinations that included low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and TB culture, if necessary. Applying the borderline zone (0.2-<0.7 IU/mL), the results were classified as definite negative, borderline negative, borderline positive and definite positive.Through the follow-up of 477 HCWs, 441 (92.5%) invariant, 30 (6.3%) conversion, 2 (0.4%) reversion and 5 (1.0%) indeterminate results were observed with the manufacturer's cutoff. Applying the borderline zone, 419 (87.8%) invariant, 22 (4.6%) conversion, 1 (0.2%) reversion and 36 (7.5%) decision pending, including 5 (1.0%) indeterminate results, were observed. At the time of screening, five TB cases were identified. Chest X-ray (CXR) identified one TB case, and LDCT identified four additional TB cases. After one year, two TB cases were diagnosed, and their screening QFT-GIT results were definite positive and borderline negative. In the Cochran-Armitage trend test, the greater the maximum difference in the QFT-GIT grade with the borderline zone was, the higher the probability of developing TB (P-value <0.001).The application of the borderline zone lowered the conversion rate but increased the decision pending rate. Introducing the borderline zone requires a careful approach, and a thorough examination needs to be performed to rule out TB in converters. HCWs with borderline QFT-GIT results also need close observation."
