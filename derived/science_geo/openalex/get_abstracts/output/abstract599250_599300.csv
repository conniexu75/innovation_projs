https://openalex.org/W2770174404,"Although schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) share elements of pathology, their neural underpinnings are still under investigation. Here, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected from a large sample of BD and SCZ patients and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed in terms of gray matter volume (GMV) using both voxel based morphometry (VBM) and a region of interest (ROI) approach.The analysis was conducted on two datasets, Dataset1 (802 subjects: 243 SCZ, 176 BD, 383 HC) and Dataset2, a homogeneous subset of Dataset1 (301 subjects: 107 HC, 85 BD and 109 SCZ). General Linear Model analyses were performed 1) at the voxel-level in the whole brain (VBM study), 2) at the regional level in the anatomical regions emerged from the VBM study (ROI study). The GMV comparison across groups was integrated with the analysis of GMV correlates of different clinical dimensions.The VBM results of Dataset1 showed 1) in BD compared to HC, GMV deficits in right cingulate, superior temporal and calcarine cortices, 2) in SCZ compared to HC, GMV deficits in widespread cortical and subcortical areas, 3) in SCZ compared to BD, GMV deficits in insula and thalamus (p<0.05, cluster family wise error corrected). The regions showing GMV deficits in the BD group were mostly included in the SCZ ones. The ROI analyses confirmed the VBM results at the regional level in most of the clusters from the SCZ vs. HC comparison (p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The VBM and ROI analyses of Dataset2 provided further evidence for the enhanced GMV deficits characterizing SCZ. Based on the clinical-neuroanatomical analyses, we cannot exclude possible confounding effects due to 1) age of onset and medication in BD patients, 2) symptoms severity in SCZ patients.Our study reported both shared and specific neuroanatomical characteristics between the two disorders, suggesting more severe and generalized GMV deficits in SCZ, with a specific role for insula and thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2769487452,"The prediction of the trends of stocks and index prices is one of the important issues to market participants. Investors have set trading or fiscal strategies based on the trends, and considerable research in various academic fields has been studied to forecast financial markets. This study predicts the trends of the Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) prices using nonparametric machine learning models: artificial neural network, support vector machines with polynomial and radial basis function kernels. In addition, this study states controversial issues and tests hypotheses about the issues. Accordingly, our results are inconsistent with those of the precedent research, which are generally considered to have high prediction performance. Moreover, Google Trends proved that they are not effective factors in predicting the KOSPI 200 index prices in our frameworks. Furthermore, the ensemble methods did not improve the accuracy of the prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2769898595,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a principal cause of the symptoms of sepsis. LPS has been reported to modulate the function of platelets although the underlying mechanisms of LPS action in these cells remain unclear. Platelets express the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which serves as a receptor for LPS, although the potential role of TLR4 and associated cell signalling in controlling platelet responses to LPS has not been extensively explored. In this study, we therefore investigated the actions of LPS prepared from different strains of Escherichia coli on platelet function, the underlying signalling mechanisms, and the potential role of TLR4 in orchestrating these. We report that LPS increased the aggregation of washed platelets stimulated by thromboxane (U46619) or GPVI collagen receptor agonists, effects that were prevented by a TLR4 antagonist. Associated with this, LPS enhanced fibrinogen binding, P-selectin exposure and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Increase of ROS was found to be important for the actions of LPS on platelets, since these were inhibited in the presence of superoxide dismutase or catalase. The effects of LPS were associated with phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and PLA2 in stimulated platelets, and inhibitors of PI3-kinase, Akt and ERK1/2 reduced significantly LPS enhanced platelet function and associated ROS production. Furthermore, inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase or the thromboxane receptor, revealed an important role for thromboxane A2. We therefore conclude that LPS increases human platelet activation through a TLR4-PI3K-Akt-ERK1/2-PLA2 -dependent pathway that is dependent on ROS and TXA2 formation."
https://openalex.org/W2771012692,"Renal involvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE) patients is one of the leading causes of morbidity and a significant contributor to mortality. It's estimated that nearly 50% of SLE individuals develop kidney disease in the first year of the diagnosis. Class IV lupus nephritis (LN-IV) is the class of lupus nephritis most common in Colombian patients with SLE. Altered miRNAs expression levels have been reported in human autoimmune diseases including lupus. Variations in the expression pattern of peripheral blood circulating miRNAs specific for this class of lupus nephritis could be correlated with the pathophysiological status of this group of individuals. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative abundance of circulating microRNAs in peripheral blood from Colombian patients with LN-IV. Circulating miRNAs in plasma of patients with diagnosis of LN-IV were compared with individuals without renal involvement (LNN group) and healthy individuals (CTL group). Total RNA was extracted from 10 ml of venous blood and subsequently sequenced using Illumina. The sequences were processed and these were analyzed using miRBase and Ensembl databases. Differential gene expression analysis was carried out with edgeR and functional analysis were done with DIANA-miRPath. Analysis was carried out using as variables of selection fold change (≥2 o ≤-2) and false discovery rate (0.05). We identified 24 circulating microRNAs with differential abundance between LN-IV and CTL groups, fourteen of these microRNAs are described for the first time to lupus nephritis (hsa-miR-589-3p, hsa-miR-1260b, hsa-miR-4511, hsa-miR-485-5p, hsa-miR-584-5p, hsa-miR-543, hsa-miR-153-3p, hsa-miR-6087, hsa-miR-3942-5p, hsa-miR-7977, hsa-miR-323b-3p, hsa-miR-4732-3p and hsa-miR-6741-3p). These changes in the abundance of miRNAs could be interpreted as alterations in the miRNAs-mRNA regulatory network in the pathogenesis of LN, preceding the clinical onset of the disease. The findings thus contribute to understanding the disease process and are likely to pave the way towards identifying disease biomarkers for early diagnosis of LN."
https://openalex.org/W2770629088,"Mankind’s quest for well-being results in continuous pressure to transform landscapes, with said transformation driven by land use changes, urbanization, production activity, and protective measures in addition to climate variability and other environmental drivers. The relationship between anthropogenic landscape changes and the provision of ecosystem services (ES) is a topic of increasing interest in Latin America. In Chile, land cover changes due to increased urbanization and forestry, and expansion of agricultural land, in addition to conservation initiatives as a part of land planning, have been intensive in the last few decades. In this study, the effects of anthropogenic landscape changes on the supply of ES were analyzed for the urban region of Santiago-Valparaiso (Chile) using a method based on expert consultation and land cover change assessment. A pool of experts scored the potential of specific land covers to provide certain ES. The results enabled calculation and mapping of changes in the potential of the landscape to supply ES. The aforementioned changes over a period of 15 years were evaluated. The results indicate a tenuous balance between positive and negative changes to the supply of ES derived from land cover changes. Understanding and reporting how these processes occur in urban regions contributes to the conservation of valuable landscapes through spatial planning tools, especially in areas close to housing developments and sensitive ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2770817681,"In developing nations, many expanding cities are facing challenges that result from the overwhelming numbers of people and vehicles. Collecting real-time, reliable and precise traffic flow information is crucial for urban traffic management. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an adaptive model that can assess the real-time vehicle counts on urban roads using computer vision technologies. This paper proposes an automatic real-time background update algorithm for vehicle detection and an adaptive pattern for vehicle counting based on the virtual loop and detection line methods. In addition, a new robust detection method is introduced to monitor the real-time traffic congestion state of road section. A prototype system has been developed and installed on an urban road for testing. The results show that the system is robust, with a real-time counting accuracy exceeding 99% in most field scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W2768245647,"Although an association between energy drinks and suicide has been suggested, few prior studies have considered the role of emotional factors including stress, sleep, and school performance in adolescents. This study aimed to evaluate the association of energy drinks with suicide, independent of possible confounders including stress, sleep, and school performance.In total, 121,106 adolescents with 13-18 years olds from the 2014 and 2015 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were surveyed for age, sex, region of residence, economic level, paternal and maternal education level, sleep time, stress level, school performance, frequency of energy drink intake, and suicide attempts. Subjective stress levels were classified into severe, moderate, mild, a little, and no stress. Sleep time was divided into 6 groups: < 6 h; 6 ≤ h < 7; 7 ≤ h < 8; 8 ≤ h < 9; and ≥ 9 h. School performance was classified into 5 levels: A (highest), B (middle, high), C (middle), D (middle, low), and E (lowest). Frequency of energy drink consumption was divided into 3 groups: ≥ 3, 1-2, and 0 times a week. The associations of sleep time, stress level, and school performance with suicide attempts and the frequency of energy drink intake were analyzed using multiple and ordinal logistic regression analysis, respectively, with complex sampling. The relationship between frequency of energy drink intake and suicide attempts was analyzed using multiple logistic regression analysis with complex sampling.Higher stress levels, lack of sleep, and low school performance were significantly associated with suicide attempts (each P < 0.001). These variables of high stress level, abnormal sleep time, and low school performance were also proportionally related with higher energy drink intake (P < 0.001). Frequent energy drink intake was significantly associated with suicide attempts in multiple logistic regression analyses (AOR for frequency of energy intake ≥ 3 times a week = 3.03, 95% CI = 2.64-3.49, P < 0.001).Severe stress, inadequate sleep, and low school performance were related with more energy drink intake and suicide attempts in Korean adolescents. Frequent energy drink intake was positively related with suicide attempts, even after adjusting for stress, sleep time, and school performance."
https://openalex.org/W2768712498,"Background Arginase is an enzyme that converts L-arginine to urea and L-ornithine, an essential substrate for the polyamine pathway supporting Leishmania (Leishmania) amazonensis replication and its survival in the mammalian host. L-arginine is also the substrate of macrophage nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) to produce nitric oxide (NO) that kills the parasite. This competition can define the fate of Leishmania infection. Methodology/Principal findings The transcriptomic profiling identified a family of oxidoreductases in L. (L.) amazonensis wild-type (La-WT) and L. (L.) amazonensis arginase knockout (La-arg-) promastigotes and axenic amastigotes. We highlighted the identification of an oxidoreductase that could act as nitric oxide synthase-like (NOS-like), due to the following evidences: conserved domain composition, the participation of NO production during the time course of promastigotes growth and during the axenic amastigotes differentiation, regulation dependence on arginase activity, as well as reduction of NO amount through the NOS activity inhibition. NO quantification was measured by DAF-FM labeling analysis in a flow cytometry. Conclusions/Significance We described an arginase-dependent NOS-like activity in L. (L.) amazonensis and its role in the parasite growth. The increased detection of NO production in the mid-stationary and late-stationary growth phases of La-WT promastigotes could suggest that this production is an important factor to metacyclogenesis triggering. On the other hand, La-arg- showed an earlier increase in NO production compared to La-WT, suggesting that NO production can be arginase-dependent. Interestingly, La-WT and La-arg- axenic amastigotes produced higher levels of NO than those observed in promastigotes. As a conclusion, our work suggested that NOS-like is expressed in Leishmania in the stationary growth phase promastigotes and amastigotes, and could be correlated to metacyclogenesis and amastigotes growth in a dependent way to the internal pool of L-arginine and arginase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2770514158,"Subjective well-being includes ‘affect’ and ‘satisfaction with life’ (SWL). This study proposes a unified approach to construct a profile of subjective well-being based on social media language in Facebook status updates. We apply sentiment analysis to generate users’ affect scores, and train a random forest model to predict SWL using affect scores and other language features of the status updates. Results show that: the computer-selected features resemble the key predictors of SWL as identified in early studies; the machine-predicted SWL is moderately correlated with the self-reported SWL (r = 0.36, p < 0.01), indicating that language-based assessment can constitute valid SWL measures; the machine-assessed affect scores resemble those reported in a previous experimental study; and the machine-predicted subjective well-being profile can also reflect other psychological traits like depression (r = 0.24, p < 0.01). This study provides important insights for psychological prediction using multiple, machine-assessed components and longitudinal or dense psychological assessment using social media language."
https://openalex.org/W2769441323,"Objective To explore the different influences of walking, running and stair activity on knee articular cartilage with T1 rho and T2 mapping sequences. Materials and methods MRI (3.0-T) scans of the right knee were performed in twenty-three young healthy adults immediately after 30 minutes of rest, walking, running and stair activity respectively. Articular cartilage was quantitatively assessed based on T1 rho and T2 relaxation times. Analysis of variance for random block design data, bonferroni test and paired samples t tests were performed to estimate the different influences of physiological activities on articular cartilage. Results T1 rho and T2 values had reductions after physiological activities in all regions of articular cartilage. T1 rho and T2 values were decreased more after running than walking. T1 rho and T2 values were decreased more after stair activity than running, except for femoral cartilage. The superficial layer of patella cartilage had higher reduction rates than the deep layer. The T1 rho and T2 values of articular cartilage were reduced in the following order: patellofemoral cartilage> medial tibiofemoral cartilage> lateral tibiofemoral cartilage. Patellofemoral cartilage experienced reductions in the following order: lateral part> middle part> medial part. Tibiofemoral cartilage had reductions in the following order: posterior part> middle part> anterior part. Conclusions T1 rho and T2 mapping sequences can quantitatively reflect the different influences of physiological activities on knee articular cartilage. Fluid shifts, collagen fiber deformation, spatial heterogeneity, inherent differences in material properties and tissue stiffness have close relationship with cartilage loading characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2951885471,"Plants often grow in clusters of various sizes and have a variable number of flowers per inflorescence. This small-scale spatial clustering affects insect foraging strategies and plant reproductive success. In our study, we aimed to determine how visitation rate and foraging behaviour of pollinators depend on the number of flowers per plant and on the size of clusters of multiple plants using Dracocephalum moldavica (Lamiaceae) as a target species. We measured flower visitation rate by observations of insects visiting single plants and clusters of plants with different numbers of flowers. Detailed data on foraging behaviour within clusters of different sizes were gathered for honeybees, Apis mellifera, the most abundant visitor of Dracocephalum in the experiments. We found that the total number of flower visitors increased with the increasing number of flowers on individual plants and in larger clusters, but less then proportionally. Although individual honeybees visited more flowers in larger clusters, they visited a smaller proportion of flowers, as has been previously observed. Consequently, visitation rate per flower and unit time peaked in clusters with an intermediate number of flowers. These patterns do not conform to expectations based on optimal foraging theory and the ideal free distribution model. We attribute this discrepancy to incomplete information about the distribution of resources. Detailed observations and video recordings of individual honeybees also showed that the number of flowers had no effect on handling time of flowers by honeybees. We evaluated the implications of these patterns for insect foraging biology and plant reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W2769497609,"The aim was to assess monomer conversion, dimensional stability, flexural strength / modulus, surface apatite precipitation and wear of mono / tri calcium phosphate (CaP) and polylysine (PLS)-containing dental composites. These were formulated using a new, high molecular weight, fluid monomer phase that requires no polymerisation activator.Urethane and Polypropylene Glycol Dimethacrylates were combined with low levels of an adhesion promoting monomer and a light activated initiator. This liquid was mixed with a hybrid glass containing either 10 wt% CaP and 1 wt% PLS (F1) or 20 wt% CaP and 2 wt% PLS (F2). Powder to liquid mass ratio was 5:1. Commercial controls included Gradia Direct Posterior (GD) and Filtek Z250 (FZ). Monomer conversion and polymerisation shrinkage were calculated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR). Subsequent volume increases in water over 7 weeks were determined using gravimetric studies. Biaxial flexural strength (BFS) / modulus (BFM) reduction and surface apatite precipitation upon 1 and 4 weeks immersion in water versus simulated body fluid (SBF) were assessed using a mechanical testing frame and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Mass / volume loss and surface roughness (Ra) following 7 weeks water immersion and subsequent accelerated tooth-brush abrasion were examined using gravimetric studies and profilometer.F1 and F2 exhibited much higher monomer conversion (72%) than FZ (54%) and low calculated polymerization shrinkage (2.2 vol%). Final hygroscopic expansions decreased in the order; F2 (3.5 vol%) > F1 (1.8 vol%) ~ Z250 (1.6 vol%) > Gradia (1.0 vol%). BFS and BFM were unaffected by storage medium type. Average BFS / BFM upon 4 weeks immersion reduced from 144 MPa / 8 GPa to 107 MPa / 5 GPa for F1 and 105 MPa / 6 GPa to 82 MPa / 4 GPa for F2. Much of this change was observed in the first week of immersion when water sorption rate was high. Surface apatite layers were incomplete at 1 week, but around 2 and 15 micron thick for F1 and F2 respectively following 4 weeks in SBF. Mass and volume loss following wear were equal. Average results for F1 (0.5%), F2 (0.7%), and FZ (0.5%) were comparable but lower than that of GD (1%). Ra, however, decreased in the order; F1 (15 μm) > F2 (11 μm) > GD (9 μm) > FZ (5 μm).High monomer conversion in combination with large monomer size and lack of amine activator should improve cytocompatibility of the new composites. High monomer molecular weight and powder content enables low polymerisation shrinkage despite high conversion. Increasing active filler provides enhanced swelling to balance shrinkage, which, in combination with greater surface apatite precipitation, may help seal gaps and reduce bacterial microleakage. High monomer conversion also ensures competitive mechanical / wear characteristics despite enhanced water sorption. Furthermore, increased active filler could help reduce surface roughness upon wear."
https://openalex.org/W2565589337,"Group formation is a quite ubiquitous phenomenon across different animal species, whose individuals cluster together forming communities of diverse size. Previous investigations suggest that, in general, this phenomenon might have similar underlying reasons across the interested species, despite genetic and behavioral differences. For instance improving the individual safety (e.g. from predators), and increasing the probability to get food resources. Remarkably, the group size might strongly vary from species to species, e.g. shoals of fishes and herds of lions, and sometimes even within the same species, e.g. tribes and families in human societies. Here we build on previous theories stating that the dynamics of group formation may have evolutionary roots, and we explore this fascinating hypothesis from a purely theoretical perspective, with a model using the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model we hypothesize that homogeneity constitutes a fundamental ingredient in these dynamics. Accordingly, we study a population that tries to form homogeneous groups, i.e. composed of similar agents. The formation of a group can be interpreted as a strategy. Notably, agents can form a group (receiving a ‘group payoff’), or can act individually (receiving an ‘individual payoff’). The phase diagram of the modeled population shows a sharp transition between the ‘group phase’ and the ‘individual phase’, characterized by a critical ‘individual payoff’. Our results then support the hypothesis that the phenomenon of group formation has evolutionary roots."
https://openalex.org/W2768282595,"Purpose Our aim was to assess the validity of the ICD-10 code for splenomegaly in the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP), as well as to investigate which underlying diseases explained the observed splenomegaly. Background Splenomegaly is a common finding in patients referred to an internal medical department and can be caused by a large spectrum of diseases, including haematological diseases and liver cirrhosis. However, some patients remain without a causal diagnosis, despite extensive medical work-up. Patients and methods We identified 129 patients through the DNRP, that had been given the ICD-10 splenomegaly diagnosis code in 1994–2013 at Odense University Hospital, Denmark, excluding patients with prior splenomegaly, malignant haematological neoplasia or liver cirrhosis. Medical records were reviewed for validity of the splenomegaly diagnosis, diagnostic work-up, and the underlying disease was determined. The positive predictive value (PPV) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the splenomegaly diagnosis code. Patients with idiopathic splenomegaly in on-going follow-up were also invited to be investigated for Gaucher disease. Results The overall PPV was 92% (95% CI: 85, 96). Haematological diseases were the underlying causal diagnosis in 39%; hepatic diseases in 18%, infectious disease in 10% and other diseases in 8%. 25% of patients with splenomegaly remained without a causal diagnosis. Lymphoma was the most common haematological causal diagnosis and liver cirrhosis the most common hepatic causal diagnosis. None of the investigated patients with idiopathic splenomegaly had Gaucher disease. Conclusion Our findings show that the splenomegaly diagnosis in the DNRP is valid and can be used in registry-based studies. However, because of suspected significant under-coding, it should be considered if supplementary data sources should be used in addition, in order to attain a more representative population. Haematological diseases were the most common cause, however in a large fraction of patients no causal diagnosis was found."

This study describes a scalable/posable approach to perform child accident reconstructions using the Position and Personalize Advanced Human Body Models for Injury Prediction (PIPER) scalable child HBM of different ages and in different positions obtained by the PIPER tool. Overall, the PIPER scalable child HBM managed reasonably well to predict the injury severity and location of the children involved in real-life crash scenarios documented in the medical records. The developed methodology and workflow is essential for future work to determine child injury tolerances based on the full Child Advanced Safety Project for European Roads (CASPER) accident reconstruction database.

https://openalex.org/W2770807774,"Introduction Single-port thoracoscopic surgery has widened the current minimally invasive surgical techniques toward more less invasive procedures in terms of reducing the number of incisions. However, the current status of oncologic outcome with this technique is not well known for lung cancer surgery. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the oncologic outcomes in early stage lung cancer for impact of the survival outcomes with our experience of conversion to a single-port approach from the conventional three-port approach. Materials and methods Retrospective data of patients who underwent thoracoscopic major lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer between January 2006 and June 2015 were analyzed. Patients’ characteristics, perioperative outcomes, pathologic result, and postoperative follow-up data of thoracoscopic surgery were reviewed and surgical outcomes were compared between conventional three-port (n = 168), two-port (n = 68), and single-port thoracoscopic surgery (n = 203). Results Of the 203 single-port thoracoscopic surgeries, we performed 167 single-port thoracoscopic lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissections. During the learning period of each thoracoscopic approach, the mean operation time for single-port thoracoscopic surgery (189±62 min) was not significantly different from those of two-port (175±46 min) and three-port (195±75 min) thoracoscopic lobectomy (p = 0.165). Perioperative outcomes including drain indwelling time (p <0.001), complication (p = 0.185) and conversion event (p = 0.911) were not worsened during learning period with two-port. Midterm survival (p = 0.753) and recurrence free survival (p = 0.656) of single port thoracoscopic lobectomy showed acceptable results compared with two- and three-port approach. Conclusions Single-port thoracoscopic surgery is safe and a feasible option for major lung resection in lung malignancy and this approach following experiences of two-port approach may yield similar oncologic results to those of conventional multi-port approach during thoracoscopic lobectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2768794886,"Simple methods for quantitative evaluations of individual motor performance are crucial for the early detection of motor deterioration. Sit-to-stand movement from a chair is a mechanically demanding component of activities of daily living. Here, we developed a novel method using the ground reaction force and center of pressure measured from the Nintendo Wii Balance Board to quantify sit-to-stand movement (sit-to-stand score) and investigated the age-related change in the sit-to-stand score as a method to evaluate reduction in motor performance. The study enrolled 503 participants (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.0 ± 19.7 years; range, 20-88 years; male/female ratio, 226/277) without any known musculoskeletal conditions that limit sit-to-stand movement, which were divided into seven 10-year age groups. The participants were instructed to stand up as quickly as possible, and the sit-to-stand score was calculated as the combination of the speed and balance indices, which have a tradeoff relationship. We also performed the timed up and go test, a well-known clinical test used to evaluate an individual's mobility. There were significant differences in the sit-to-stand score and timed up and go time among age groups. The mean sit-to-stand score for 60s, 70s, and 80s were 77%, 68%, and 53% of that for the 20s, respectively. The timed up and go test confirmed the age-related decrease in mobility of the participants. In addition, the sit-to-stand score measured using the Wii Balance Board was compared with that from a laboratory-graded force plate using the Bland-Altman plot (bias = -3.1 [ms]-1, 95% limit of agreement: -11.0 to 3.9 [ms]-1). The sit-to-stand score has good inter-device reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.87). Furthermore, the test-retest reliability is substantial (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.64). Thus, the proposed STS score will be useful to detect the early deterioration of motor performance."
https://openalex.org/W2769018984,"Background Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Sri Lanka is caused by Leishmania donovani. This study assessed the diagnostic value of a new rapid diagnostic immunochromatographic strip (CL-Detect™ IC-RDT), that captures the peroxidoxin antigen of Leishmania amastigotes. Methodology/Principal findings We sampled 74 clinically suspected CL lesions, of which 59 (79.7%) were positive by PCR, 43 (58.1%) by Giemsa stained slit skin smear (SSS) and 21 (28.4%) by the new IC-RDT. All samples which were positive either by SSS or IC-RDT or both were positive by PCR. The sensitivities of the IC-RDT and SSS compared to PCR were 36% and 73%, respectively. Fifteen patients from this endemic region were negative by all three tests. Twenty two clinically non-CL skin lesions from a CL non-endemic region were also negative by all three methods. Specificity and PPV of both IC-RDT and SSS compared to PCR were 100%; the NPVs of IC-RDT and SSS were 37% and 58%, respectively. The median parasite grading of the 59 PCR positive samples was 2+ (1–10 parasites/100 HPFs) and IC-RDT positive lesions was 3+ (1–10 parasites /10HPFs). The duration of the lesion was not associated with IC-RDT positivity. Conclusions/Significance The median parasite grade of Sri Lankan CL lesions is low. The low sensitivities of SSS and CL Detect™ IC-RDT may be due to low parasite counts or low expression of peroxidoxin antigen in amastigotes of the Sri Lankan L. donovani strain. Our results indicate that negative SSS has to be combined with PCR for confirmation of CL in Sri Lanka. The current commercially available IC-RDT is not suitable to diagnose CL in Sri Lanka; an IC-RDT with improved sensitivity to detect L. donovani would be a valuable addition in the diagnostic tool kit for Sri Lanka."
https://openalex.org/W2769408525,"Objective Postoperative pneumonia (POP) is common and results in prolonged hospital stays, higher costs, increased morbidity and mortality. However, data on the incidence and risk factors of POP after oral and maxillofacial surgery are rare. This study aims to identify perioperative risk factors for POP after major oral cancer (OC) surgery. Methods Perioperative data and patient records of 331 consecutive subjects were analyzed in the period of April 2014 to March 2016. We individually traced each OC patient for a period to discharge from the hospital or 45 days after surgery, whichever occur later. Results The incidence of POP after major OC surgery with free flap construction or major OC surgery was 11.6% or 4.5%, respectively. Patient-related risk factors for POP were male sex, T stage, N stage, clinical stage and preoperative serum albumin level. Among the investigated procedure-related variables, incision grade, mandibulectomy, free flap reconstruction, tracheotomy, intraoperative blood loss, and the length of the operation were shown to be associated with the development of POP. Postoperative hospital stay was also significantly related to increased incidence of POP. Using a multivariable logistic regression model, we identified male sex, preoperative serum albumin level, operation time and postoperative hospital stay as independent risk factors for POP. Conclusion Several perioperative risk factors can be identified that are associated with POP. At-risk oral cancer patients should be subjected to intensified postoperative pulmonary care."
https://openalex.org/W2768122996,"Botanicals are widely used as dietary supplements and for the prevention and treatment of disease. Despite a long history of use, there is generally little evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these preparations. Curcumin has been used to treat a myriad of human diseases and is widely advertised and marketed for its ability to improve health, but there is no clear understanding how curcumin interacts with cells and affects cell physiology. D. discoideum is a simple eukaryotic lead system that allows both tractable genetic and biochemical studies. The studies reported here show novel effects of curcumin on cell proliferation and physiology, and a pleiotropic effect on gene transcription. Transcriptome analysis showed that the effect is two-phased with an early transient effect on the transcription of approximately 5% of the genome, and demonstrates that cells respond to curcumin through a variety of previously unknown molecular pathways. This is followed by later unique transcriptional changes and a protein kinase A dependent decrease in catalase A and three superoxide dismutase enzymes. Although this results in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS; superoxide and H2O2), the effects of curcumin on transcription do not appear to be the direct result of oxidation. This study opens the door to future explorations of the effect of curcumin on cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2770535637,"The nuclear protein constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR or NR1I3) regulates several liver functions such as drug and energy metabolism and cell growth or death, which are often involved in the development of diseases such as diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma. CAR undergoes a conversion from inactive homodimers to active heterodimers with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and phosphorylation of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) at Thr-38 in CAR regulates this conversion. Here, we uncovered the molecular mechanism by which this phosphorylation regulates the intramolecular interaction between CAR’s DBD and ligand-binding domain (LBD), enabling the homodimer–heterodimer conversion. Phosphomimetic substitution of Thr-38 with Asp increased co-immunoprecipitation of the CAR DBD with CAR LBD in Huh-7 cells. Isothermal titration calorimetry assays also revealed that recombinant CAR DBD-T38D, but not nonphosphorylated CAR DBD, bound the CAR LBD peptide. This DBD–LBD interaction masked CAR’s dimer interface, preventing CAR homodimer formation. Of note, EGF signaling weakened the interaction of CAR DBD T38D with CAR LBD, converting CAR to the homodimer form. The DBD-T38D–LBD interaction also prevented CAR from forming a heterodimer with RXRα. However, this interaction opened up a CAR surface, allowing interaction with protein phosphatase 2A. Thr-38 dephosphorylation then dissociated the DBD–LBD interaction, allowing CAR heterodimer formation with RXRα. We conclude that the intramolecular interaction of phosphorylated DBD with the LBD enables CAR to adapt a transient monomer configuration that can be converted to either the inactive homodimer or the active heterodimer. The nuclear protein constitutive active/androstane receptor (CAR or NR1I3) regulates several liver functions such as drug and energy metabolism and cell growth or death, which are often involved in the development of diseases such as diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Thus, CAR activation can become either a beneficial or a risk factor in developing various toxicities in response to drug/chemical exposures, drug–drug interactions, and diseases (i.e. diabetes, steatosis, cholestasis, and hepatocellular carcinoma) (1Gao J.

In transformed cells, CAR is a constitutively active nuclear receptor that spontaneously accumulates in cell nuclei, and forms a heterodimer with RXRα to activate target gene transcription. CAR represses this constitutive activity by phosphorylation of Thr-38 within the DNA-binding domain in both mouse and human primary hepatocytes and in mouse livers. Thus, the underlying mechanism that regulates CAR is phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Thr-38 for inactivation and activation, respectively. Protein phosphatase PP2A and scaffold protein receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) are key factors for dephosphorylation at Thr-38 (7Mutoh S. Sobhany M. Moore R. Perera L. Pedersen L. Sueyoshi T.

Moreover, monomerization of phosphorylated CAR initiates this dephosphorylation (10Shizu R. Osabe M. Perera L. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M.

Biol. 2017; 37 (28265001)e00649 Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CAR ligands such as 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3] thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO) directly bind phosphorylated CAR, which dissociates from ERK1/2, monomerizing CAR for dephosphorylation and activation (10Shizu R.

Although the cell signaling that regulates CAR and how drugs such as PB utilize it to activate CAR have now been delineated, the molecular mechanism by which CAR integrates this cell signaling at the protein level remains unexplored. Here, we have investigated interactions between the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of CAR to probe the molecular basis by which CAR dephosphorylates at Thr-38 for activation of transcriptional enhancer functionality. Co-immunoprecipitation assays of tagged proteins in Huh-7 cells and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays with bacterially expressed recombinant proteins were employed to delineate the nature and regulation of these interactions. We present experimental data demonstrating that phosphorylation of Thr-38 regulates the CAR DBD's interaction with the LBD in response to EGF, and discuss the hypothesis that the DBD regulates CAR activation through homodimer-monomer conversion in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Interaction between the DBD and LBD was examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays. For this, either a GFP-tagged CAR DBD T38D or CAR DBD T38A mutant was ectopically co-expressed with FLAG-tagged CAR LBD in Huh-7 cells. Whole cell extracts were then prepared for subsequent immunoprecipitations. CAR DBD was precipitated by an anti-GFP antibody and the resultant precipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1A). The CAR LBD was far more effectively co-precipitated with CAR DBD T38D than with CAR DBD T38A. Furthermore, ITC was performed to examine this DBD–LBD interaction using recombinant CAR proteins expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli cells. CAR DBD T38D bound CAR LBD with the dissociation constant (Kd) of 3.44 μm (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, no binding was detected between CAR LBD and CAR DBD WT. In both co-immunoprecipitation and ITC assays, phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-38 enhanced CAR DBD binding of CAR LBD. As shown in Fig. 1, FLAG-tagged CAR LBD and GFP-tagged CAR LBD were co-precipitated, suggesting that two CAR LBDs interacted to form a homodimer. However, this co-immunoprecipitation was greatly decreased in the presence of CAR DBD T38D in Huh-7 cells (Fig. 1C, arrow by LBD). This decrease reciprocated the dramatic increase in co-precipitation of LBD with DBD (Fig. 1C, arrow by DBD). Additional co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to examine whether the EGF signal regulates CAR DBD T38D interaction with CAR LBD. EGF treatment effectively ablated co-immunoprecipitation of DBD with LBD (Fig. 2). The ability of CAR DBD T38D to limit CAR LBD homodimerization (Fig. 1C) combined with the ability of EGF to inhibit CAR DBD T38D interactions with CAR LBD suggests homodimerization of CAR is regulated in a signal-dependent manner by EGF. This finding became the impetus for the subsequent investigation.Figure 2EGF regulation of the DBD–LBD interaction. Huh-7 cells co-expressing FLAG- and GFP-tagged CAR T38D were treated with 10 ng/ml of EGF for 30 min. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG or anti-GFP antibody for subsequent Western blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CAR DBD encompasses amino acid residues from 8 to 78, from which two deletion constructs (residues 8–41 and 42–63) were generated and tagged with GFP (Fig. 3A). Full-length or deletion constructs were co-expressed with FLAG-tagged CAR LBD in Huh-7 cells, from which whole cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation assays using an anti-FLAG antibody. The 42–63 construct, but not the 8–41 construct, was co-precipitated with CAR LBD (Fig. 3B). The 42–63 residues include the motif called D-box, which constitutes five amino acids at the N terminus of second zinc finger. The D-box is known to regulate DBD dimerization and DNA binding, whereas it does not bind DNA (12Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J.

Subsequently, the D-box motif within the 42–63 construct was highlighted as a potential target of this DBD–LBD interaction. All these amino acids, PFAGS, were mutated to arginine within the context of the 42–63 construct. The resultant mutant was co-expressed with FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged CAR LBDs in Huh-7 cells. This mutant was not co-precipitated with CAR LBD (Fig. 3C, arrow by DBD). However, FLAG-tagged CAR LBD and GFP-tagged CAR LBD were co-precipitated in the presence of this mutant (Fig. 3C, arrow by LBD). Thus, these results delineated the interaction site of DBD with LBD to the D-box motif. CAR LBD has been suggested to form a homodimer through three loops: loop 1 (residues 142–145), loop 2 (residues 210–218), and loop 3 (residues 301–307) (10Shizu R. Osabe M. Perera L. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Phosphorylated nuclear receptor CAR forms a homodimer to repress its constitutive activity for ligand activation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2017; 37 (28265001)e00649 Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the DBD–LBD interaction inhibited CAR LBD to form a homodimer (Fig. 1C), it was expected that one of these loops interact with the DBD. Peptide competition assays were employed to examine this expectation. GFP-tagged DBD-(42–63) construct and FLAG-tagged LBD were co-immunoprecipitated in the presence or absence of one of these peptides. A glucocorticoid receptor α (GR) loop peptide was used as a negative control. Only peptide 3 effectively inhibited co-precipitation of LBD with DBD (Fig. 3D). To further support the role of loop 3 in this interaction, residues within the D-box and loop 3 were mutated to positively charged arginine and negatively charged aspartic acid, respectively, within the context of CAR T38D. We termed this resultant mutant T38D construct E-mutant (Fig. 3E). These mutations should have strengthened the interaction between the D-box and loop 3. E-mutant was tagged with FLAG or GFP and ectopically co-expressed in Huh-7 cells, and whole cell extracts were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays to examine their interactions. Similarly, FLAG-tagged and GFP-tagged CAR T38D were co-expressed and co-precipitated as a positive control. As expected, these tagged CAR T38D proteins increased their co-immunoprecipitation in response to EGF treatment. In contrast, T38D E-mutant was unable to respond to EGF treatment (Fig. 3E). Thus, these results supported the notion that D-box and loop 3 mediate the DBD–LBD interaction and inhibit homodimerization of CAR. GFP-tagged CAR T38D and FLAG-tagged CAR T38D, which were co-expressed in Huh-7 cells, were co-immunoprecipitated in response to EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Reciprocally, EGF decreased co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged CAR T38D with RACK1 (Fig. 4C). These observations confirmed that CAR T38D forms a homodimer in response to EGF signal and dissociates RACK1 to evade dephosphorylation, as suggested by our previous findings (10Shizu R. Osabe M. Perera L. Moore R. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Phosphorylated nuclear receptor CAR forms a homodimer to repress its constitutive activity for ligand activation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2017; 37 (28265001)e00649 Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). CAR T38DΔHinge (hereafter, ΔHinge) was generated by deleting hinge region residues 89 to 100 within the context of CAR T38D. FLAG-tagged ΔHinge was co-expressed with GFP-tagged CAR T38D in Huh-7 cells. Unlike CAR T38D, ΔHinge co-precipitated with CAR T38D in the absence of EGF treatment (Fig. 4B). Moreover, ΔHinge was not co-precipitated with RACK1 (Fig. 4C), and did not trans-activate a CYP2B6 promoter in Huh-7 cell-based reporter assays even after CITCO treatment (Fig. 4D). Thus, the ΔHinge appeared to constitutively be maintained as a homodimer. CAR is known to trans-activate gene promoters by forming a heterodimer with RXRα (15Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. The nuclear orphan receptor CAR-retinoid X receptor heterodimer activates the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module of the CYP2B gene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18 (9742082): 5652-565810.1128/MCB.18.10.5652Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at Thr-38 was found to abrogate CAR’s DNA binding (11Mutoh S. Osabe M. Inoue K. Moore R. Pedersen L. Perera L. Rebolloso Y. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Dephosphorylation of threonine 38 is required for nuclear translocation and activation of human xenobiotic receptor CAR (NR1I3).J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19858220): 34785-3479210.1074/jbc.M109.048108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that this interaction also regulated heterodimerization with RXRα. FLAG-tagged CAR LBD and GFP-tagged RXRα LBD were co-expressed in the presence or absence of GFP-tagged CAR DBD T38D in Huh-7 cells. CAR and RXRα co-precipitated in the absence of CAR DBD T38D, but not in its presence (Fig. 5A, arrow by GFP RXR LBD). Under these conditions where heterodimerization was suppressed, CAR LBD increased its interaction with CAR DBD T38D (Fig. 5A, arrow by GFP DBD). To better understand how the CAR DBD regulates heterodimerization, three mutants were constructed using the CAR T38D construct to affect the interactions between the D-box of the DBD and loop 3 of the LBD, as shown in Fig. 5C. R-, E-, and S-mutants were designed to repel, tighten, and neutralize these interactions, respectively. Among them, the E-mutant can be expected to restrict the DBD binding to the LBD by enforcing the D-box–loop 3 interaction. Using these three mutants, in vitro pulldown assays were employed to examine their interactions with RXRα. The E-mutant was found not to pull down RXRα (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the E-mutant was unable to trans-activate a reporter gene in cell-based transfection assays (Fig. 5D). These studies suggest that the DBD–LBD interactions control regulation of CAR homodimerization and CAR heterodimerization with RXRα. CAR WT (residues 1–348) or its T38D mutant were expressed as SUMO conjugates in E. coli cells. After purification and removal of SUMO, these recombinant CARs were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. Based on comparison to Mr standards, CAR WT preferentially eluted as a monomer, with about 10% being dimer (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, at least 50% of CAR T38D eluted as a dimer (Fig. 6A). The purity and content of the peaks was verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6B) and mass spectrometry (data not shown). Utilizing these pure CAR constructs, fluorescence polarization was employed to examine binding of CAR to its enhancer DNA (DR4) from the CYP2B6 promoter in the presence or absence of RXRα. Neither elicited polarization in the absence of RXRα. In the presence of RXRα, CAR WT bound DNA with the dissociation constant (Kd) of 169 ± 31 nm (Fig. 6C). CAR T38D exhibited weak binding with a Kd value of 1,231 ± 323 nm (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that phosphorylation of the DBD at Thr-38 not only regulates CAR homodimerization, but also heterodimerization with RXRα, thereby regulating the ability of CAR to bind DNA. CAR undergoes homodimer–heterodimer conversion to control its activity for regulatory activation. This conversion is regulated by phosphorylation of Thr-38 within the DBD. Phosphorylation strengthens an intramolecular interaction of the DBD with LBD, enabling phosphorylated CAR to be a monomer. Upon dephosphorylation of Thr-38 by PP2A and RACK1, the DBD dissociates from the LBD, allowing dephosphorylated CAR to form a heterodimer with RXRα for activation. Conversely, this phosphorylated CAR monomer can also be converted to a phosphorylated homodimer, suppressing its constitutive activity. This homodimerization is regulated by EGF signaling, which weakens the interaction of phosphorylated LBD with the DBD. Based on these observations of protein–protein interactions in solution, the regulatory process of CAR is schematically depicted in Fig. 7. The intramolecular DBD–LBD interaction is the underlying mechanism by which CAR regulates its conversions, and the phosphorylated CAR monomer is positioned such that it can be converted to an inactive homodimer or to an active heterodimer with RXRα. In our previous studies, phosphorylation at Thr-38 was found to regulate CAR activation (i.e. nuclear translocation, DNA binding as a trans-activation) and confirmed in mouse livers as well as with mouse primary hepatocytes or in vitro binding assays (7Mutoh S. Sobhany M. Moore R. Perera L. Pedersen L. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M.

Given these findings, this phosphorylation-mediated interaction between the DBD and LBD should also be the molecular basis for endogenous CAR activation in an in vivo set up. Our model of CAR dimerization conversions supports a role of the hinge to create separation between the DBD and LBD such that these two domains are not interacting in an inactive homodimer (Fig. 7A). In this model, the hinge acts as a spring connecting the DBD and LBD to regulate their interactions. CAR would then stretch this spring to form its homodimer or bend it to remain a monomer. When the hinge was deleted, CAR lost this flexibility to position the DBD relative to LBD and remained a homodimer, unable to convert to either a monomer or heterodimer (Fig. 4) and unable to translocate to nucleus (17Kanno Y. Suzuki M. Nakahama T. Inouye Y. Characterization of nuclear localization signals and cytoplasmic retention region in the nuclear receptor CAR.Biochim. Biophys.

In the X-ray crystal structure of DNA-bound hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α), a homodimer is observed that utilizes helices 10 and 11 to form the dimer interface, which was located opposite from the surface that constitutes the CARs homodimer region without DNA present (CAR only binds DNA as an RXRα heterodimer). In this HNF4α homodimer, the DBD of one monomer is interacting with the LBD of the other monomer, in which, serine 78 of the DBD (corresponds to Thr-38 of CAR) interacts with the loop that corresponds to loop 3 of CAR. The authors suggested a scenario that phosphorylation of serine 78 disrupts this interaction, dissociating the intermolecular interaction between DBD and LBD and inactivating HNF4α. This scenario is different from our hypothesis of the CAR activation mechanism depicted in Fig. 7. In our present CAR studies, phosphorylation of Thr-38 strengthened the intra-molecular interaction between the D-box and loop 3 (Fig. 7, B and C). Thr-38 resides in the helix between the two zinc fingers. Our dynamic computer simulation study had previously suggested that phosphorylation of Thr-38 causes a conformational alteration from this helix toward the second finger where the D-box is located (11Mutoh S.

Taking these simulations into consideration, phosphorylated Thr-38 may not necessarily interact with loop 3 directly, but phosphorylation-initiated conformational changes may help the D-box interact with loop 3, strengthening the DBD–LBD interaction. This would be consistent with our hypothesis that the DBD and LBD dissociate when CAR forms either an inactive homodimer or an active heterodimer with RXRα. This dissociation is also observed with thyroid hormone receptor that dissociates its DBD–LBD interaction in the presence of DNA oligomers of binding motif TRE (20Putcha B.D. Fernandez E.J.

Because recombinant CAR T38D, but not CAR WT, expressed in and purified from E. coli cells as its homodimer, phosphorylated CAR’s inherent nature may be to homodimerize.

https://openalex.org/W2768957262,"Introduction The treatment of choice for Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) is the monoclonal antibody eculizumab. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in a cohort of kidney transplant patients suffering from aHUS. Methods Description of the prospective cohort of all the patients primarily treated with eculizumab after transplantation and divided into the therapeutic (onset of aHUS after transplantation) and prophylactic use (patients with previous diagnosis of aHUS undergoing kidney transplantation). Results Seven cases were outlined: five of therapeutic use and two, prophylactic. From the five cases of therapeutic use, there was improvement of the thrombotic microangiopathy in the 48 hours following the start of the drug and no patient experienced relapse during an average follow-up of 21 months in the continuous use of eculizumab (minimum of 6 and maximum of 42 months). One patient died at 6 months, due to Aspergillus infection. From the two cases of prophylactic use, one patient experienced relapsed thrombotic microangiopathy after 4 months and another patient remained asymptomatic after 16 months of follow-up, both on chronic treatment. Discussion The therapeutic use of eculizumab showed to be effective, with improvement of the microangiopathy parameters and persisting up to the end of the follow-up, without relapses. The additional risk of immunosuppression, leading to opportunistic infections, was well tolerated. The prophylactic use showed to be effective and safe; however, the doses and intervals should be individualized in order to avoid relapsed microangiopathy, especially in patients with factor H mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2770967264,"The automatic generation of test cases oriented paths in an effective manner is a challenging problem for structural testing of software. The use of search-based optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms (GAs), has been proposed to handle this problem. This paper proposes an improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA) for test cases generation by maintaining population diversity. It uses adaptive crossover rate and mutation rate in dynamic adjustment according to the differences between individual similarity and fitness values, which enhances the exploitation of searching global optimum. This novel approach is experimented and tested on a benchmark and six industrial programs. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method is efficient in generating test cases for path coverage."
https://openalex.org/W2768773966,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people and increasing longevity ensures its prevalence will rise even further. Whether AD originates by disconnecting a localized brain area and propagates to the rest of the brain across disease-severity progression is a question with an unknown answer. An important related challenge is to predict whether a given subject, with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI), will convert or not to AD. Here, our aim is to characterize the structural connectivity pattern of MCI and AD subjects using the multivariate distance matrix regression (MDMR) analysis, and to compare it to those of healthy subjects. MDMR is a technique developed in genomics that has been recently applied to functional brain network data, and here applied to identify brain nodes with different connectivity patterns, in controls and patients, because of brain atrophy. We address this issue at the macroscale by looking to differences in individual structural MRI brain networks, obtained from MR images according to a recently proposed definition of connectivity which measures the image similarity between patches at different locations in the brain. In particular, using data from ADNI, we selected four groups of subjects (all of them matched by age and sex): HC (healthy control participants), ncMCI (mild cognitive impairment not converting to AD), cMCI (mild cognitive impairment converting to AD) and AD. Next, we built structural MRI brain networks and performed group comparison for all the pairs of groups. Our results were three-fold: (i) considering the comparison of HC with the three other groups, the number of significant brain regions was 4 for ncMCI, 290 for cMCI and 74 for AD, out of a total of 549 regions; hence, in terms of the structural MRI connectivity here adopted, cMCI subjects have the maximal altered pattern w.r.t. healthy conditions. (ii) Eight and seven nodes were significant for the comparisons AD-ncMCI and AD-cMCI, respectively; six nodes, among them, were significant in both comparisons and these nodes form a connected brain region (corresponding to hippocampus, amygdala, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Planum Polare, Frontal Orbital Cortex, Temporal Pole and subcallosal cortex) showing reduced strength of connectivity in the MCI stages; (iii) The connectivity maps of cMCI and ncMCI subjects significantly differ from the connectome of healthy subjects in three regions all corresponding to Frontal Orbital Cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2768410814,"Introduction Breach of confidentiality or invasion of privacy from the collection and use of medical records, particularly those of patients with HIV/AIDS or other diseases sensitive to stigmatization, should be prevented by all related stakeholders in healthcare settings. The main focus of this study was to assess practices regarding security and confidentiality of HIV-related information among staff at HIV outpatient clinics (HIV-OPCs) in Vietnam. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at all 312 HIV-OPCs across the country using an online survey technique. Results In general, the staff practices for securing and protecting patient information were at acceptable levels. Most staff had proper measures and practices for maintaining data security; however, the protection of patient confidentiality, particularly for data access, sharing, and transfer still required improvement. Most HIV-OPC staff had good or moderate knowledge and positive perceptions towards security and confidentiality issues. Staff who were not trained in the practice of security measures differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 3.74; 95%CI: 1.44–9.67); staff needing improved knowledge levels differed significantly from those with good (OR: 5.20; 95%CI: 2.39–11.32) and moderate knowledge levels (OR: 5.10; 95%CI: 2.36–11.00); and staff needing improved perception levels differed significantly from those with good (i.e., with 100% proper practices) and moderate perception levels (OR: 5.67; 95%CI: 2.93–10.95). Staff who were not trained in the protection of data confidentiality differed significantly from those who were trained (OR: 2.18; 95%CI: 1.29–3.65). Conclusions Training is an important factor to help raise the levels of proper practices regarding confidentiality and security, to improve knowledge and raise awareness about change among staff. The operation and management of HIV treatment and care in Vietnam are currently transitioning from separate healthcare clinics (HIV-OPC) into units integrated into general hospitals/healthcare facilities. The findings of this study highlight topics that could be used for improving management and operation of information system and revising guidelines and regulations on protection measures/strategies for data security and confidentiality of HIV/AIDS patients by Vietnam health authorities or other countries facing similar situations. Secure infrastructure and secure measures for data access and use are very important, worthwhile investments. The provision of continuous training and active enforcement and monitoring of the practices of healthcare personnel might lead to an improved understanding and acknowledegement of the importance of national policies/guidelines regarding HIV-related patient information."
https://openalex.org/W2770104943,"Knockout of the mitochondrial complex I protein, NDUFS4, profoundly increases sensitivity of mice to volatile anesthetics. In mice carrying an Ndufs4lox/lox gene, adeno-associated virus expressing Cre recombinase was injected into regions of the brain postulated to affect sensitivity to volatile anesthetics. These injections generated otherwise phenotypically wild type mice with region-specific, postnatal inactivation of Ndufs4, minimizing developmental effects of gene loss. Sensitivities to the volatile anesthetics isoflurane and halothane were measured using loss of righting reflex (LORR) and movement in response to tail clamp (TC) as endpoints. Knockdown (KD) of Ndufs4 in the vestibular nucleus produced resistance to both anesthetics for movement in response to TC. Ndufs4 loss in the central and dorsal medial thalami and in the parietal association cortex increased anesthetic sensitivity to both TC and LORR. Knockdown of Ndufs4 only in the parietal association cortex produced striking hypersensitivity for both endpoints, and accounted for half the total change seen in the global KO (Ndufs4(KO)). Excitatory synaptic transmission in the parietal association cortex in slices from Ndufs4(KO) animals was hypersensitive to isoflurane compared to control slices. We identified a direct neural circuit between the parietal association cortex and the central thalamus, consistent with a model in which isoflurane sensitivity is mediated by a thalamic signal relayed through excitatory synapses to the parietal association cortex. We postulate that the thalamocortical circuit is crucial for maintenance of consciousness and is disrupted by the inhibitory effects of isoflurane/halothane on mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2770481645,"Background Sepsis is a condition characterized by high mortality rates and often accompanied by multiple-organ dysfunction. During sepsis, respiratory system may be affected and possibly result in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as a first line defense against invading pathogens, seem to be highly expressed in septic states. Therefore, expression of TLRs in the lungs of a sepsis animal model could indicate the involvement of the respiratory system and appear as a severity index of the clinical course. Materials and methods A total of 72 C57BL/6J mice, aged 12–14 weeks, were studied. The animals were divided into 3 sepsis (S) groups (24h, 48h and 72h) and 3 control (C) groups (24h, 48h and 72h), each consisting of 12 mice. The S-groups were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) while the C-groups had a sham operation performed. Blood samples were drawn from all groups. Total blood count analysis was performed along with the measurement of certain biochemical markers. Additionally, lung tissues were harvested and the expression of TLRs, namely TLR 2, TLR 3, TLR 4 and TLR 7 were evaluated by means of immunofluorescence (IF) and qRT-PCR (quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction). Statistical analysis was performed by using one-way ANOVA followed by student t-test. Results were considered statistically significant when p<0.05. Results WBCs and lymphocytes were decreased in all S-groups compared to the corresponding C-groups (p<0.05), while RBCs showed a gradual decline in S-groups with the lowest levels appearing in the S72 group. Only, monocytes were higher in S-groups, especially between S48-C48 (p<0.05) and S72-C72 (p<0.05). Creatinine, IL-10 and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the S-groups compared to the corresponding C-groups (S24 vs C24, S48 vs C48 and S72 vs C72, p<0.05). IF showed that expression of TLRs 2, 3, 4 and 7 was increased in all S-groups compared to the time-adjusted C-groups (p<0.05). Similarly, qRT-PCR revealed that expression of all TLRs was higher in all S-groups compared to their respective C-groups in both lungs and intestine (p<0.05). Comparing lung and intestinal tissues from S-groups, TLRs 2 and 4 were found increased in the lung at 24, 48 and 72 hours (p<0.05), whereas TLR 3 was higher in the intestine at all time points examined (p<0.05). Finally, TLR 7 levels were significantly higher in the intestinal tissues at 24 hours (p<0.0001), while lungs predominated at 48 hours (p<0.0001). Conclusion TLRs seem to be highly expressed in the lungs of septic mice, therefore suggesting a potential role in the pathogenesis of ARDS during sepsis. While more studies need to be conducted in order to completely understand the underlying mechanisms, TLRs may represent a promising target for establishing novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2768689979,"Given the importance of microbiology results on patient care, high quality standards are expected. Internal quality assurance (IQA) could mitigate the limitations of internal quality control, competency assessment and external quality assurance, adding a longitudinal insight, including pre- and post-analytical steps. Here, we implemented an IQA program in our clinical microbiology facilities with blind resubmission of routine samples during 22 months. One-hundred-and-twenty-one out of 123 (98.4%) serological analyses and 112 out of 122 (91.8%) molecular analyses were concordant. Among the discordances in molecular biology analyses, 6 results were low positive samples that turned out negative, likely due to stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. Moreover, one identified retranscription error led us to implement automated results transmission from the Applied Biosystems instruments to the laboratory information system (LIS). Regarding Gram stain microscopy, 560 out of 745 (75.2%) of compared parameters were concordant. As many as 67 out of 84 (79.8%) pairs of culture results were similar, including 16 sterile pairs, 27 having identical identification or description and semi-quantification and 24 only showing variations in semi-quantification with identical description or identification of colonies. Seventeen pairs had diverging identification or description of colonies. Culture was twice only done for one member of the pairs. Regarding antibiotic susceptibility testing, a major discrepancy was observed in 5 out of 48 results (10.4%). In conclusion, serological tests were highly reproducible. Molecular diagnosis also revealed to be robust except when the amounts of nucleic acids present in the sample were close to the limits of detection. Conventional microbiology was less robust with major discrepancies reaching 39.5% of the samples for microscopy. Similarly, culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing were prone to discrepancies. This work was ground for reconsidering multiples aspects of our practices and demonstrates the importance of IQA to complete the other quality management procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2769170060,"High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a Fraction Collector was employed to isolate Maillard reaction products (MRPs) formed in model systems comprising of asparagine and monosaccharides in the 60-180°C range. The primary MRP which is detected at 60°C is important for Acrylamide content and color/aroma development in foods and also in the field of food biotechnology for controlling the extent of the Maillard reaction with temperature. The discrete fractions of the reaction products were reacted with Hemoglobin (Hb) and Myoglobin (Mb) at physiological conditions and the reaction adducts were monitored by UV-vis and Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometry. The UV-vis kinetic profiles revealed the formation of a Soret transition characteristic of a low-spin six-coordinated species and the ATR-FTIR spectrum of the Hb-MRP and Mb-MRP fractions showed modifications in the protein Amide I and II vibrations. The UV-vis and the FTIR spectra of the Hb-MRPs indicate that the six-coordinated species is a hemichrome in which the distal E7 Histidine is coordinated to the heme Fe and blocks irreversibly the ligand binding site. Although the Mb-MRPs complex is a six-coordinated species, the 1608 cm-1 FTIR band characteristic of a hemichrome was not observed."
https://openalex.org/W2769869859,"Standard tissue culture practices involve propagating cells on tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) dishes, which are flat, 2-dimensional (2D) and orders of magnitude stiffer than most tissues in the body. Such simplified conditions lead to phenotypical cell changes and altered cell behaviors. Hence, much research has been focused on developing novel biomaterials and culture conditions that more closely emulate in vivo cell microenvironments. In particular, biomaterial stiffness has emerged as a key property that greatly affects cell behaviors such as adhesion, morphology, proliferation and motility among others. Here we ask whether cells that have been conditioned to TCP, would still show significant dependence on substrate stiffness if they are first pre-adapted to a more physiologically relevant environment. We used two commonly utilized breast cancer cell lines, namely MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, and examined the effect of prolonged cell culturing on polyacrylamide substrates of varying compliance. We followed changes in cell adhesion, proliferation, shape factor, spreading area and spreading rate. After pre-adaptation, we noted diminished differences in cell behaviors when comparing between soft (1 kPa) and stiff (103 kPa) gels as well as rigid TCP control. Prolonged culturing of cells on complaint substrates further influenced responses of pre-adapted cells when transferred back to TCP. Our results have implications for the study of stiffness-dependent cell behaviors and indicate that cell pre-adaptation to the substrate needs consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2770039793,"Registration of laser scans, or point clouds in general, is a crucial step of localization and mapping with mobile robots or in object modeling pipelines. A coarse alignment of the point clouds is generally needed before applying local methods such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. We propose a feature-based approach to point cloud registration and evaluate the proposed method and its individual components on challenging real-world datasets. For a moderate overlap between the laser scans, the method provides a superior registration accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods including Generalized ICP, 3D Normal-Distribution Transform, Fast Point-Feature Histograms, and 4-Points Congruent Sets. Compared to the surface normals, the points as the underlying features yield higher performance in both keypoint detection and establishing local reference frames. Moreover, sign disambiguation of the basis vectors proves to be an important aspect in creating repeatable local reference frames. A novel method for sign disambiguation is proposed which yields highly repeatable reference frames."
https://openalex.org/W2768846049,"Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel/cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (NAC-DCF) was identified as a novel strong regimen with a high rate of pathological complete response (pCR) in advanced esophageal cancer in Japan. Predicting pCR will contribute to the therapeutic strategy and the prevention of surgical invasion. However, a predictor of pCR after NAC-DCF has not yet been developed. The aim of this study was to identify a novel predictor of pCR in locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with NAC-DCF.A total of 32 patients who received NAC-DCF followed by esophagectomy between June 2013 and March 2016 were enrolled in this study. We divided the patients into the following 2 groups: pCR group (9 cases) and non-pCR group (23 cases), and compared gene expressions between these groups using DNA microarray data and KeyMolnet. Subsequently, a validation study of candidate molecular expression was performed in 7 additional cases.Seventeen molecules, including transcription factor E2F, T-cell-specific transcription factor, Src (known as ""proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase of sarcoma""), interferon regulatory factor 1, thymidylate synthase, cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK, caspase-1, vitamin D receptor, histone deacetylase, MAPK/ERK kinase, bcl-2-associated X protein, runt-related transcription factor 1, PR domain zinc finger protein 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and interleukin 1, were identified as candidate molecules. The molecules were mainly associated with pathways, such as transcriptional regulation by SMAD, RB/E2F, and STAT. The validation study indicated that 12 of the 17 molecules (71%) matched the trends of molecular expression.A 17-molecule set that predicts pCR after NAC-DCF for locally advanced esophageal cancer was identified."
https://openalex.org/W2769048270,"This paper introduces a new framework for the segmentation of different brain structures (white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) from 3D MR brain images at different life stages. The proposed segmentation framework is based on a shape prior built using a subset of co-aligned training images that is adapted during the segmentation process based on first- and second-order visual appearance characteristics of MR images. These characteristics are described using voxel-wise image intensities and their spatial interaction features. To more accurately model the empirical grey level distribution of the brain signals, we use a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG) model having positive and negative components. To accurately account for the large inhomogeneity in infant MRIs, a higher-order Markov-Gibbs Random Field (MGRF) spatial interaction model that integrates third- and fourth- order families with a traditional second-order model is proposed. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated on 102 3D MR brain scans using three metrics: the Dice coefficient, the 95-percentile modified Hausdorff distance, and the absolute brain volume difference. Experimental results show better segmentation of MR brain images compared to current open source segmentation tools."
https://openalex.org/W2770252904,"Radioactive contamination in the Tokyo metropolitan area in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident was analyzed via surface soil sampled during a two-month period after the accident. 131I, 134Cs, and 137Cs were detected in these soil samples. The activity and inventory of radioactive material in the eastern part of Tokyo tended to be high. The 134Cs/137Cs activity ratio in soil was 0.978 ± 0.053. The 131I/137Cs ratio fluctuated widely, and was 19.7 ± 9.0 (weighted average 18.71 ± 0.13, n = 14) in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The radioactive plume with high 131I activity spread into the Tokyo metropolitan area and was higher than the weighted average of 6.07 ± 0.04 (n = 26) in other areas. The radiocesium activity and inventory surveyed in soil from a garden in Chiyoda Ward in the center of Tokyo, fell approximately 85% in the four months after the accident, and subsequently tended to rise slightly while fluctuating widely. It is possible that migration and redistribution of radiocesium occurred. The behavior of radiocesium in Tokyo was analyzed via monitoring of radiocesium in sludge incineration ash. The radiocesium activity in the incineration ash was high at wastewater treatment centers that had catchment areas in eastern Tokyo and low at those with catchment areas in western Tokyo. Similar to the case of the garden soil, even in incineration ash, the radiocesium activity dropped rapidly immediately after the accident. The radiocesium activity in the incineration ash fell steadily from the tenth month after the accident until December 2016, and its half-life was about 500 days. According to frequency analysis, in central Tokyo, the cycles of fluctuation of radiocesium activity in incineration ash and rainfall conformed, clearly showing that radiocesium deposited in urban areas was resuspended and transported by rainfall run-off."
https://openalex.org/W2768326041,"Oxidative stress is increasingly implicated as a co-factor of tissue injury in inflammatory/demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis (MS). While rodent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models diverge from human demyelinating disorders with respect to limited oxidative injury, we observed that in a non-human primate (NHP) model for MS, namely EAE in the common marmoset, key pathological features of the disease were recapitulated, including oxidative tissue injury. Here, we investigated the presence of oxidative injury in another NHP EAE model, i.e. in rhesus macaques, which yields an acute demyelinating disease, which may more closely resemble acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) than MS. Rhesus monkey EAE diverges from marmoset EAE by abundant neutrophil recruitment into the CNS and destructive injury to white matter. This difference prompted us to investigate to which extent the oxidative pathway features elicited in MS and marmoset EAE are reflected in the acute rhesus monkey EAE model. The rhesus EAE brain was characterized by widespread demyelination and active lesions containing numerous phagocytic cells and to a lesser extent T cells. We observed induction of the oxidative stress pathway, including injury, with a predilection of p22phox expression in neutrophils and macrophages/microglia. In addition, changes in iron were observed. These results indicate that pathogenic mechanisms in the rhesus EAE model may differ from the marmoset EAE and MS brain due to the neutrophil involvement, but may in the end lead to similar induction of oxidative stress and injury."
https://openalex.org/W2769903557,"Little is known about the acquisition of intubation skills among novice physicians during their one-year clinical training. Our primary objective was to determine the changes in the intubation skills of novice physicians between prior to the clinical training and after completion of the clinical training. We used data of a prospective longitudinal multicenter data registry developed to investigate factors associated with the improvement of intubation skills among novice physicians. The study participants included 90 postgraduate year 1 physicians in 2015–2016. We used 4 simulation scenarios based on the devices used (direct laryngoscope [DL] and Airway scope [AWS]) and difficulty of intubation (normal and difficult scenarios). As a marker of the intubation skills, we used the force applied on the maxillary incisors and the tongue with each intubation. We compared the data obtained prior to clinical training with those obtained after completion of one-year clinical training. When using DL, compared to prior, significantly less force were applied on the maxillary incisors and the tongue after clinical training in the normal scenario (28.0 N vs 19.5 N, p < 0.001, and 11.1 N vs 8.4 N, p = 0.004). Likewise, when using AWS, compared to prior, significantly less force were applied on the tongue after clinical training in the normal scenario (22.0 N vs 0 N, p < 0.001). The force on the tongue decreased after clinical training but not significant. These associations persisted in the difficult airway scenario. These findings suggest that force applied on oral structures can be quantified as a marker of intubation skills by using high-fidelity simulators, and the assessment of procedural competency is recommended for all novice physicians prior to performing intubation in the clinical setting to improve the quality of emergency care."
https://openalex.org/W2768894240,"The aims of this study were to describe the evolution of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections since 2004 and to determine its associated factors. Acute HCV infections diagnosed in Barcelona from 2004 to 2015 were included. Incidence ratios (IR) were then estimated for sex and age groups. Cases were grouped between 2004–2005, 2006–2011 and 2012–2015, and their incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated. In addition, risk factors for acute HCV infection were identified using multinomial logistic regression for complete, available and multiple imputed data. 204 new HCV cases were identified. Two peaks of higher IR of acute HCV infection in 2005 and 2013 were observed. Men and those aged 35–54 had higher IR. IRR for men was 2.9 times greater than in women (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.8 ‒ 4.7). Factors related to the period 2012–2015 (versus 2006–2011) were: a) sexual risk factor for transmission versus nosocomial (relative-risk ratio (RRR): 13.0; 95% CI: 2.3 ‒ 72.1), b) higher educated versus lower (RRR: 5.4; 95% CI: 1.6 ‒ 18.7), and c) HIV co-infected versus not HIV-infected (RRR: 53.1; 95% CI: 5.7 ‒ 492.6). This is one of the few studies showing IR and RRRs of acute HCV infections and the first focused on a large city in Spain. Sexual risk for transmission between men, higher educational level and HIV co-infection are important factors for understanding current HCV epidemic. There has been a partial shift in the pattern of the risk factor for transmission from nosocomial to sexual."
https://openalex.org/W2769669548,"Transforming acidic coiled-coil-containing protein 3 (TACC3), a microtubule regulator, is associated with various cancers. However, the relationship between TACC3 and soft tissue sarcomas (STS) remains unclear. We investigated the expression of TACC3 in 136 STS patient samples using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and the statistical associations between TACC3 expression and clinicopathological characteristics were evaluated. Additionally, the expression levels of the tumor suppressor p53 and of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 were also assessed by IHC. High TACC3 expression was detected in 94/136 of STS cases (69.1%), and significantly correlated with higher grade according to the French Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer system (P<0.0001), poorer tumor differentiation (P<0.0001), increased mitotic counts (P<0.0001), advanced stage per American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines (P<0.0001), higher p53 expression (P = 0.0487), higher Ki-67 expression (P<0.0001), and undergoing postoperative therapy (P = 0.0001). Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with high TACC3 expression were significantly shorter (P<0.0001 and P<0.0001, respectively). On multivariate analyses, high TACC3 expression was an independent negative prognostic factor for both DFS and OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.074; P = 0.0235 and HR: 8.521; P = 0.0415, respectively). Our results suggest that TACC3 is an independent prognostic factor and may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of STS."
https://openalex.org/W2770141399,"Readers’ eye movements were recorded to examine the role of character positional frequency on Chinese lexical acquisition during reading and its possible modulation by word spacing. In Experiment 1, three types of pseudowords were constructed based on each character’s positional frequency, providing congruent, incongruent, and no positional word segmentation information. Each pseudoword was embedded into two sets of sentences, for the learning and the test phases. In the learning phase, half the participants read sentences in word-spaced format, and half in unspaced format. In the test phase, all participants read sentences in unspaced format. The results showed an inhibitory effect of character positional frequency upon the efficiency of word learning when processing incongruent pseudowords both in the learning and test phase, and also showed facilitatory effect of word spacing in the learning phase, but not at test. Most importantly, these two characteristics exerted independent influences on word segmentation. In Experiment 2, three analogous types of pseudowords were created whilst controlling for orthographic neighborhood size. The results of the two experiments were consistent, except that the effect of character positional frequency was absent in the test phase in Experiment 2. We argue that the positional frequency of a word’s constituent characters may influence the character-to-word assignment in a process that likely incorporates both lexical segmentation and identification."
https://openalex.org/W2768175180,"Unprotected sexual intercourse after undergoing voluntary medical male circumcision but prior to complete wound healing can lead to major adverse events including HIV acquisition. To better understand perceptions related to early resumption of sex prior to wound healing, 27 focus group discussions were conducted among 238 adult men, women, and community leaders in Botswana. Median age among all participants was 31 years of whom 60% were male and 51% were either employed and receiving salary or self-employed. Only 12% reported being currently married. Pain, not risk of HIV acquisition, was perceived as the main adverse consequence of early resumption of sex. In fact, no participant mentioned that early resumption of sex could lead to an increase in HIV risk. Demonstrating masculinity and virility, fear of losing female partners, and misperception about post-operative wound healing also played key roles in the decision to resume sex prior to complete wound healing. Findings from this study highlight a potentially widespread lack of awareness of the increased risk of HIV acquisition during the wound healing period. Strengthening post-operative counseling and identifying strategies to discourage the early resumption of sex will be increasingly important as older men and HIV-positive men seek voluntary medical male circumcision services."
https://openalex.org/W2769212001,"This study investigated exposure time, running and skill-related performance in two international u20 rugby union teams during an intensified tournament: the 2015 Junior World Rugby Championship.Both teams played 5 matches in 19 days. Analyses were conducted using global positioning system (GPS) tracking (Viper 2™, Statsports Technologies Ltd) and event coding (Opta Pro®).Of the 62 players monitored, 36 (57.1%) participated in 4 matches and 23 (36.5%) in all 5 matches while player availability for selection was 88%. Analyses of team running output (all players completing >60-min play) showed that the total and peak 5-minute high metabolic load distances covered were likely-to-very likely moderately higher in the final match compared to matches 1 and 2 in back and forward players. In individual players with the highest match-play exposure (participation in >75% of total competition playing time and >75-min in each of the final 3 matches), comparisons of performance in matches 4 and 5 versus match 3 (three most important matches) reported moderate-to-large decreases in total and high metabolic load distance in backs while similar magnitude reductions occurred in high-speed distance in forwards. In contrast, skill-related performance was unchanged, albeit with trivial and unclear changes, while there were no alterations in either total or high-speed running distance covered at the end of matches.These findings suggest that despite high availability for selection, players were not over-exposed to match-play during an intensified u20 international tournament. They also imply that the teams coped with the running and skill-related demands. Similarly, individual players with the highest exposure to match-play were also able to maintain skill-related performance and end-match running output (despite an overall reduction in the latter). These results support the need for player rotation and monitoring of performance, recovery and intervention strategies during intensified tournaments."
https://openalex.org/W2770074951,"Deoxyarbutin, a potent inhibitor of tyrosinase, could act as substrate of the enzyme. Oxytyrosinase is able to hydroxylate deoxyarbutin and finishes the catalytic cycle by oxidizing the formed o-diphenol to quinone, while the enzyme becomes deoxytyrosinase, which evolves to oxytyrosinase in the presence of oxygen. This compound is the only one described that does not release o-diphenol after the hydroxylation step. Oxytyrosinase hydroxylates the deoxyarbutin in ortho position of the phenolic hydroxyl group by means of an aromatic electrophilic substitution. As the oxygen orbitals and the copper atoms are not coplanar, but in axial/equatorial position, the concerted oxidation/reduction cannot occur and the release of a copper atom to bind again in coplanar position, enabling the oxidation/reduction or release of the o-diphenol from the active site to the medium. In the case of deoxyarbutin, the o-diphenol formed is repulsed by the water due to its hydrophobicity, and so can bind correctly and be oxidized to a quinone before being released. Deoxyarbutin has been characterized with: = 1.95 ± 0.06 s-1 and = 33 ± 4 μM. Computational simulations of the interaction of β-arbutin, deoxyarbutin and their o-diphenol products with tyrosinase show how these ligands bind at the copper centre of tyrosinase. The presence of an energy barrier in the release of the o-diphenol product of deoxyarbutin, which is not present in the case of β-arbutin, together with the differences in polarity and, consequently differences in their interaction with water help understand the differences in the kinetic behaviour of both compounds. Therefore, it is proposed that the release of the o-diphenol product of deoxyarbutin from the active site might be slower than in the case of β-arbutin, contributing to its oxidation to a quinone before being released from the protein into the water phase."
https://openalex.org/W2770355270,"Toxoplasma gondii is capable of persisting in the brain, although it is efficiently eliminated by cellular immune responses in most other sites. While Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) reportedly plays important roles in protective immunity against the parasite, the relationship between neurological disorders induced by T. gondii infection and TLR2 function in the brain remains controversial with many unknowns. In this study, primary cultured astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and peritoneal macrophages obtained from wild-type and TLR2-deficient mice were exposed to T. gondii tachyzoites. To characterize TLR2-dependent functional pathways activated in response to T. gondii infection, gene expression of different cell types was profiled by RNA sequencing.During T. gondii infection, a total of 611, 777, 385, and 1105 genes were upregulated in astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and macrophages, respectively, while 163, 1207, 158, and 1274 genes were downregulated, respectively, in a TLR2-dependent manner. Overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms for TLR2-dependently upregulated genes were associated with immune and stress responses in astrocytes, immune responses and developmental processes in microglia, metabolic processes and immune responses in neurons, and metabolic processes and gene expression in macrophages. Overrepresented GO terms for downregulated genes included ion transport and behavior in astrocytes, cell cycle and cell division in microglia, metabolic processes in neurons, and response to stimulus, signaling and cell motility in macrophages.To our knowledge, this is the first transcriptomic study of TLR2 function across different cell types during T. gondii infection. Results of RNA-sequencing demonstrated roles for TLR2 varied by cell type during T. gondii infection. Our findings facilitate understanding of the detailed relationship between TLR2 and T. gondii infection, and elucidate mechanisms underlying neurological changes during infection."
https://openalex.org/W2766699080,"Sexual partnerships that overlap in time (concurrent relationships) may play a significant role in the HIV epidemic, but the precise effect is unclear. We derive edge-based compartmental models of disease spread in idealized dynamic populations with and without concurrency to allow for an investigation of its effects. Our models assume that partnerships change in time and individuals enter and leave the at-risk population. Infected individuals transmit at a constant per-partnership rate to their susceptible partners. In our idealized populations we find regions of parameter space where the existence of concurrent partnerships leads to substantially faster growth and higher equilibrium levels, but also regions in which the existence of concurrent partnerships has very little impact on the growth or the equilibrium. Additionally we find mixed regimes in which concurrency significantly increases the early growth, but has little effect on the ultimate equilibrium level. Guided by model predictions, we discuss general conditions under which concurrent relationships would be expected to have large or small effects in real-world settings. Our observation that the impact of concurrency saturates suggests that concurrency-reducing interventions may be most effective in populations with low to moderate concurrency."
https://openalex.org/W2768358048,"Located near the equator, Malaysia is a country with one of the highest lightning densities in the world. Lightning contributes to 70% of the power outages in Malaysia and affects power equipment, automated network systems, causes data losses and monetary losses in the nation. Therefore, consideration of insulator evaluation under lightning impulses can be crucial to evaluate and attempt to overcome this issue. This paper presents a new approach to increase the electrical performance of polymer insulators using a Room Temperature Vulcanisation (RTV) coating. The evaluation involves three different settings of polymer insulator, namely uncoated, RTV type 1, and RTV type 2 upper surface coatings. All the insulators were tested under three different conditions as dry, clean wet and salty under different impulse polarities using the even-rising test method. The voltage breakdown for each test was recorded. From the experiment, it was found that the effectiveness of the RTV coating application became apparent when tested under salty or polluted conditions. It increased the voltage withstand capabilities of the polymer insulator up to 50% from the basic uncoated insulator. Under dry and clean conditions, the RTV coating provided just a slight increase of the breakdown voltage. The increase in voltage breakdown capability decreased the probability of surface discharge and dry band arcing that could cause degradation of the polymeric material housing. The RTV type 1 coating was found to be more effective when performing under a lightning impulse. The findings might help the utility companies improve the performance of their insulators in order to increase power system reliability."
https://openalex.org/W2768838718,"Background Progression to diabetes mellitus (DM) is variable and the screening time interval not well defined. The American Diabetes Association and US Preventive Services Task Force suggest screening every 3 years, but evidence is limited. The objective of the study was to develop a model to predict the probability of developing DM and suggest a risk-based screening interval. Methods We included non-diabetic adult patients screened for DM in the Cleveland Clinic Health System if they had at least two measurements of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), an initial one less than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) in 2008, and another between January, 2009 and December, 2013. Cox proportional hazards models were created. The primary outcome was DM defined as HbA1C greater than 6.4% (46 mmol/mol). The optimal rescreening interval was chosen based on the predicted probability of developing DM. Results Of 5084 participants, 100 (4.4%) of the 2281 patients with normal HbA1c and 772 (27.5%) of the 2803 patients with prediabetes developed DM within 5 years. Factors associated with developing DM included HbA1c (HR per 0.1 units increase 1.20; 95%CI, 1.13–1.27), family history (HR 1.31; 95%CI, 1.13–1.51), smoking (HR 1.18; 95%CI, 1.03–1.35), triglycerides (HR 1.01; 95%CI, 1.00–1.03), alanine aminotransferase (HR 1.07; 95%CI, 1.03–1.11), body mass index (HR 1.06; 95%CI, 1.01–1.11), age (HR 0.95; 95%CI, 0.91–0.99) and high-density lipoproteins (HR 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90–0.95). Five percent of patients in the highest risk tertile developed DM within 8 months, while it took 35 months for 5% of the middle tertile to develop DM. Only 2.4% percent of the patients in the lowest tertile developed DM within 5 years. Conclusion A risk prediction model employing commonly available data can be used to guide screening intervals. Based on equal intervals for equal risk, patients in the highest risk category could be rescreened after 8 months, while those in the intermediate and lowest risk categories could be rescreened after 3 and 5 years respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2769607965,"Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, is a critical step in cancer invasion. Better understanding of the angiogenic mechanisms is required to develop effective antiangiogenic therapies for cancer treatment. We culture angiogenic vessels in 3D microfluidic devices under different Sphingosin-1-phosphate (S1P) conditions and develop an automated vessel formation tracking system (AVFTS) to track the angiogenic vessel formation and extract quantitative vessel information from the experimental time-lapse phase contrast images. The proposed AVFTS first preprocesses the experimental images, then applies a distance transform and an augmented fast marching method in skeletonization, and finally implements the Hungarian method in branch tracking. When applying the AVFTS to our experimental data, we achieve 97.3% precision and 93.9% recall by comparing with the ground truth obtained from manual tracking by visual inspection. This system enables biologists to quantitatively compare the influence of different growth factors. Specifically, we conclude that the positive S1P gradient increases cell migration and vessel elongation, leading to a higher probability for branching to occur. The AVFTS is also applicable to distinguish tip and stalk cells by considering the relative cell locations in a branch. Moreover, we generate a novel type of cell lineage plot, which not only provides cell migration and proliferation histories but also demonstrates cell phenotypic changes and branch information."
https://openalex.org/W2770448005,"To explore the association between birth season and physical development and provide a necessary reference value to inform the implementation of public health services.Cross-sectional study.Forty-five counties in ten provinces in western China in 2005.A sample of 13,387 children under 3 years old and their mothers were recruited using a stratified, multistage, cluster random sampling method.The results of the circular distribution analysis suggested that stunting and underweight exhibited time aggregation (Z = 32.57, P<0.05; Z = 10.42, P<0.05) among children under 3 years old. The Z - value for wasting, however, was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The generalized linear mixed models showed that children born in the summer were less likely to exhibit stunting (OR: 0.74~0.97) than were children born in the winter after adjusting for confounders, but no significant differences were identified for the other seasons. In addition, among children aged 25 to 36 months, those born in the summer and autumn were less likely to exhibit stunting after adjusting for confounders than were children born in the winter, but the association between birth in spring and stunting was not statistically significant.Stunting was associated with season of birth among children under 3 years old in low-income counties in western China, especially children aged 25 to 36 months, and children born in the summer and autumn were less likely to exhibit stunting than were children born in the winter."
https://openalex.org/W2770863679,"Although HIV disease stage at ART initiation critically determines ART outcomes, few reports have longitudinally monitored this within Asia. Using prospectively collected data from a large ART program at Sihanouk Hospital Center of Hope in Cambodia, we report on the change in patient characteristics and outcomes over a ten-year period.We conducted a retrospective analysis including all adults (≥ 18 years old) starting ART from March 2003-March 2013 in a non-governmental hospital in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The cumulative incidence of death, lost to follow-up (LTFU), attrition (death or LTFU) and first line treatment failure were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Independent risk factors for these outcomes were determined using Cox regression modeling.Over the ten-year period, 3581 patients initiated ART with a median follow-up time of 4.8 years (IQR 2.8-7.2). The median age was 35 years (IQR 30-41), 54% were female. The median CD4 count at ART initiation increased from 22 cells/μL (IQR 4-129) in 2003 to 218 (IQR 57-302) in 2013. Over the 10 year period, a total of 282 (7.9%) individuals died and 433 (12.1%) were defined LTFU. Program attrition (died or LTFU) was 11.1% (95% CI: 10.1%- 12.4%) at one year, 16.3% (95% CI: 15.1%-17.6%) at three years, 19.8% (95% CI: 18.5%-21.2%) at five years and 23.3% (95% CI: 21.6-25.1) at ten years. Male sex and low baseline body mass index (BMI) were associated with increased attrition. Factors independently associated with mortality included a low baseline CD4 count, older age, male sex, low baseline BMI and hepatitis B co-infection. Individuals aged above 40 years old had an increased risk of mortality but were less likely to LTFU. There were a total of 137 individuals with first line ART failure starting second line treatment. The probability of first line failure was estimated at 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3%-3.4%) at 3 years, 4.6% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.5%) at 5 years and 7.8% (95% CI 4.8%-12.5%) at ten years of ART. The probability was particularly high in the first few program years. A lower risk was observed among individuals starting ART during the 2006-2008 period. Factors independently associated with an increased risk of treatment failure included ART-experience, NVP-based ART and a baseline CD4 count below 200 cells/μL.Overall program outcomes were fair, and generally compare well to other reports from the region. Despite gradually earlier initiation of ART over the ten year period, ART is still initiated at too low CD4 count levels, warranting increased efforts for early HIV diagnosis and enrolment/retention into HIV care. Tailored strategies for poor prognostic groups (older age, male, low BMI) should be designed and evaluated."
