https://openalex.org/W1979026577,"The recent insight that brown adipocytes and muscle cells share a common origin and in this respect are distinct from white adipocytes has spurred questions concerning the origin and molecular characteristics of the UCP1-expressing cells observed in classic white adipose tissue depots under certain physiological or pharmacological conditions. Examining precursors from the purest white adipose tissue depot (epididymal), we report here that chronic treatment with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist rosiglitazone promotes not only the expression of PGC-1alpha and mitochondriogenesis in these cells but also a norepinephrine-augmentable UCP1 gene expression in a significant subset of the cells, providing these cells with a genuine thermogenic capacity. However, although functional thermogenic genes are expressed, the cells are devoid of transcripts for the novel transcription factors now associated with classic brown adipocytes (Zic1, Lhx8, Meox2, and characteristically PRDM16) or for myocyte-associated genes (myogenin and myomirs (muscle-specific microRNAs)) and retain white fat characteristics such as Hoxc9 expression. Co-culture experiments verify that the UCP1-expressing cells are not proliferating classic brown adipocytes (adipomyocytes), and these cells therefore constitute a subset of adipocytes (""brite"" adipocytes) with a developmental origin and molecular characteristics distinguishing them as a separate class of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2005505978,"It is established that the adipocyte-derived cytokine adiponectin protects against cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but the effect of this adipokine on macrophage polarization, an important mediator of disease progression, has never been assessed. We hypothesized that adiponectin modulates macrophage polarization from that resembling a classically activated M1 phenotype to that resembling alternatively-activated M2 cells. Peritoneal macrophages and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells of adipose tissue isolated from adiponectin knock-out mice displayed increased M1 markers, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and decreased M2 markers, including arginase-1, macrophage galactose N-acetyl-galactosamine specific lectin-1, and interleukin-10. The systemic delivery of adenovirus expressing adiponectin significantly augmented arginase-1 expression in peritoneal macrophages and SVF cells in both wild-type and adiponectin knock-out mice. In culture, the treatment of macrophages with recombinant adiponectin protein led to an increase in the levels of M2 markers and a reduction of reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species-related gene expression. Adiponectin also stimulated the expression of M2 markers and attenuated the expression of M1 markers in human monocyte-derived macrophages and SVF cells isolated from human adipose tissue. These data show that adiponectin functions as a regulator of macrophage polarization, and they indicate that conditions of high adiponectin expression may deter metabolic and cardiovascular disease progression by favoring an anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1967901428,"SIRT1 is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that regulates a variety of pathways including the stress protection pathway. SIRT1 deacetylates a number of protein substrates, including histones, FOXOs, PGC-1α, and p53, leading to cellular protection. We identified a functional interaction between cJUN N-terminal kinase (JNK1) and SIRT1 by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins. The interaction between JNK1 and SIRT1 was identified under conditions of oxidative stress and required activation of JNK1 via phosphorylation. Modulation of SIRT1 activity or protein levels using nicotinamide or RNAi did not modify JNK1 activity as measured by its ability to phosphorylate cJUN. In contrast, human SIRT1 was phosphorylated by JNK1 on three sites: Ser27, Ser47, and Thr530 and this phosphorylation of SIRT1 increased its nuclear localization and enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, JNK1 phosphorylation of SIRT1 showed substrate specificity resulting in deacetylation of histone H3, but not p53. These findings identify a mechanism for regulation of SIRT1 enzymatic activity in response to oxidative stress and shed new light on its role in the stress protection pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1982827785,"Despite the short length of their reads, micro-read sequencing technologies have shown their usefulness for de novo sequencing. However, especially in eukaryotic genomes, complex repeat patterns are an obstacle to large assemblies.We present a novel heuristic algorithm, Pebble, which uses paired-end read information to resolve repeats and scaffold contigs to produce large-scale assemblies. In simulations, we can achieve weighted median scaffold lengths (N50) of above 1 Mbp in Bacteria and above 100 kbp in more complex organisms. Using real datasets we obtained a 96 kbp N50 in Pseudomonas syringae and a unique 147 kbp scaffold of a ferret BAC clone. We also present an efficient algorithm called Rock Band for the resolution of repeats in the case of mixed length assemblies, where different sequencing platforms are combined to obtain a cost-effective assembly.These algorithms extend the utility of short read only assemblies into large complex genomes. They have been implemented and made available within the open-source Velvet short-read de novo assembler."
https://openalex.org/W2079428292,"Heterogeneity of cancer stem/progenitor cells that give rise to different forms of cancer has been well demonstrated for leukemia. However, this fundamental concept has yet to be established for solid tumors including breast cancer. In this communication, we analyzed solid tumor cancer stem cell markers in human breast cancer cell lines and primary specimens using flow cytometry. The stem/progenitor cell properties of different marker expressing-cell populations were further assessed by in vitro soft agar colony formation assay and the ability to form tumors in NOD/SCID mice. We found that the expression of stem cell markers varied greatly among breast cancer cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 cells, PROCR and ESA, instead of the widely used breast cancer stem cell markers CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) and ALDH, could be used to highly enrich cancer stem/progenitor cell populations which exhibited the ability to self renew and divide asymmetrically. Furthermore, the PROCR(+)/ESA(+) cells expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. PROCR could also be used to enrich cells with colony forming ability from MB-361 cells. Moreover, consistent with the marker profiling using cell lines, the expression of stem cell markers differed greatly among primary tumors. There was an association between metastasis status and a high prevalence of certain markers including CD44(+)/CD24(-/low), ESA(+), CD133(+), CXCR4(+) and PROCR(+) in primary tumor cells. Taken together, these results suggest that similar to leukemia, several stem/progenitor cell-like subpopulations can exist in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025512372,"Patients with type 2 diabetes lose β cells, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the principal source of the major intracellular reduc-tant, NADPH, which is required by many enzymes, including enzymes of the antioxidant pathway. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that high glucose impairs G6PD activity in endothelial and kidney cells, which leads to decreased cell survival. Pancreatic β cells are highly sensitive to increased ROS. This study aimed to determine whether G6PD and NADPH play central roles in β-cell survival. Human and mouse islets, MIN6 cell line, and G6PD deficient mice were studied. High glucose inhibited G6PD expression and activity. Inhibition of G6PD with siRNA led to increased ROS and apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and impaired insulin secretion. High glucose decreased insulin secretion, which was improved by overexpressing G6PD. G6PD-deficient mice had smaller islets and impaired glucose tolerance compared with control mice, which suggests that G6PD deficiency per se leads to β-cell dysfunction and death. G6PD plays an important role in β-cell function and survival. High-glucose-mediated decrease in G6PD activity may provide a mechanistic explanation for the gradual loss of β cells in patients with diabetes.—Zhang, Z., Liew, C. W., Handy, D.

https://openalex.org/W2170005697,"Background Man to mosquito transmission of malaria depends on the presence of the sexual stage parasites, gametocytes, that often circulate at low densities. Gametocyte densities below the microscopical threshold of detection may be sufficient to infect mosquitoes but the importance of submicroscopical gametocyte carriage in different transmission settings is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings Membrane feeding experiments were carried out on 80 children below 14 years of age at the end of the wet season in an area of seasonal malaria transmission in Burkina Faso. Gametocytes were quantified by microscopy and by Pfs25-based quantitative nucleic acid sequence-based amplification assay (QT-NASBA). The children's infectiousness was determined by membrane feeding experiments in which a venous blood sample was offered to locally reared Anopheles mosquitoes. Gametocytes were detected in 30.0% (24/80) of the children by microscopy compared to 91.6% (65/71) by QT-NASBA (p<0.001). We observed a strong association between QT-NASBA gametocyte density and infection rates (p = 0.007). Children with microscopically detectable gametocytes were more likely to be infectious (68.2% compared to 31.7% of carriers of submicroscopical gametocytes, p = 0.001), and on average infected more mosquitoes (13.2% compared to 2.3%, p<0.001). However, because of the high prevalence of submicroscopical gametocyte carriage in the study population, carriers of sub-microscopical gametocytes were responsible for 24.2% of the malaria transmission in this population. Conclusions/Significance Submicroscopical gametocyte carriage is common in an area of seasonal transmission in Burkina Faso and contributes substantially to the human infectious reservoir. Submicroscopical gametocyte carriage should therefore be considered when implementing interventions that aim to reduce malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2011783070,"Amphibians are experiencing a panzootic of unprecedented proportions caused by the emergence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, all species are not equally at risk of infection, and risk is further modified by environmental variables, specifically temperature. In order to understand how, and when, hosts mount a response to Bd we analysed infection dynamics and patterns of gene expression in the model amphibian species Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis. Mathematical modelling of infection dynamics demonstrate the existence of a temperature-dependent protective response that is largely independent of the intrinsic growth-rate of Bd. Using temporal expression-profiling by microarrays and qRT-PCR, we characterise this response in the main amphibian lymphoid tissue, the spleen. We demonstrate that clearance of Bd at the host-optimal temperature is not clearly associated with an adaptive immune response, but rather is correlated with the induction of components of host innate immunity including the expression of genes that are associated with the production of the antimicrobial skin peptide preprocareulein (PPCP) as well as inflammatory responses. We find that adaptive immunity appears to be lacking at host-optimal temperatures. This suggests that either Bd does not stimulate, or suppresses, adaptive immunity, or that trade-offs exist between innate and adaptive limbs of the amphibian immune system. At cold temperatures, S. tropicalis loses the ability to mount a PPCP-based innate response, and instead manifests a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is characterised by the production of proteases and higher pathogen burdens. This study demonstrates the temperature-dependency of the amphibian response to infection by Bd and indicates the influence that changing climates may exert on the ectothermic host response to pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1979425737,"Antimicrobials are used to directly control bacterial infections in pet (ornamental) fish and are routinely added to the water these fish are shipped in to suppress the growth of potential pathogens during transport.To assess the potential effects of this sustained selection pressure, 127 Aeromonas spp. isolated from warm and cold water ornamental fish species were screened for tolerance to 34 antimicrobials. Representative isolates were also examined for the presence of 54 resistance genes by a combination of miniaturized microarray and conventional PCR. Forty-seven of 94 Aeromonas spp. isolates recovered from tropical ornamental fish and their carriage water were tolerant to > or =15 antibiotics, representing seven or more different classes of antimicrobial. The quinolone and fluoroquinolone resistance gene, qnrS2, was detected at high frequency (37% tested recent isolates were positive by PCR). Class 1 integrons, IncA/C broad host range plasmids and a range of other antibiotic resistance genes, including floR, bla(TEM-1), tet(A), tet(D), tet(E), qacE2, sul1, and a number of different dihydrofolate reductase and aminoglycoside transferase coding genes were also detected in carriage water samples and bacterial isolates.These data suggest that ornamental fish and their carriage water act as a reservoir for both multi-resistant bacteria and resistance genes."
https://openalex.org/W2063398824,"Fishery management has historically been an inexact and reactionary discipline, often taking action only after a critical stock suffers overfishing or collapse. The invertebrate ornamental fishery in the State of Florida, with increasing catches over a more diverse array of species, is poised for collapse. Current management is static and the lack of an adaptive strategy will not allow for adequate responses associated with managing this multi-species fishery. The last decade has seen aquarium hobbyists shift their display preference from fish-only tanks to miniature reef ecosystems that include many invertebrate species, creating increased demand without proper oversight. The once small ornamental fishery has become an invertebrate-dominated major industry supplying five continents.Here, we analyzed the Florida Marine Life Fishery (FLML) landing data from 1994 to 2007 for all invertebrate species. The data were organized to reflect both ecosystem purpose (in the wild) and ecosystem services (commodities) for each reported species to address the following question: Are ornamental invertebrates being exploited for their fundamental ecosystem services and economic value at the expense of reef resilience? We found that 9 million individuals were collected in 2007, 6 million of which were grazers.The number of grazers now exceeds, by two-fold, the number of specimens collected for curio and ornamental purposes altogether, representing a major categorical shift. In general, landings have increased 10-fold since 1994, though the number of licenses has been dramatically reduced. Thus, despite current management strategies, the FLML Fishery appears to be crawling to collapse."
https://openalex.org/W1970831921,"The metal-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze hydrolysis of acetyl groups from acetyllysine side chains and are targets of cancer therapeutics. Two bound monovalent cations (MVCs) of unknown function have been previously observed in crystal structures of HDAC8; site 1 is near the active site, whereas site 2 is located >20 Å from the catalytic metal ion. Here we demonstrate that one bound MVC activates catalytic activity (<i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 3.4 mm for K<sup>+</sup>), whereas the second, weaker-binding MVC (<i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> = 26 mm for K<sup>+</sup>) decreases catalytic activity by 11-fold. The weaker binding MVC also enhances the affinity of the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid by 5-fold. The site 1 MVC is coordinated by the side chain of Asp-176 that also forms a hydrogen bond with His-142, one of two histidines important for catalytic activity. The D176A and H142A mutants each increase the <i>K</i><sub>1/2</sub> for potassium inhibition by ≥40-fold, demonstrating that the inhibitory cation binds to site 1. Furthermore, the MVC inhibition is mediated by His-142, suggesting that this residue is protonated for maximal HDAC8 activity. Therefore, His-142 functions either as an electrostatic catalyst or a general acid. The activating MVC binds in the distal site and causes a time-dependent increase in activity, suggesting that the site 2 MVC stabilizes an active conformation of the enzyme. Sodium binds more weakly to both sites and activates HDAC8 to a lesser extent than potassium. Therefore, it is likely that potassium is the predominant MVC bound to HDAC8 <i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2140789504,"The pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a burst of cAMP upon infection of macrophages. Bacterial cyclic AMP receptor proteins (CRP) are transcription factors that respond to cAMP by binding at target promoters when cAMP concentrations increase. Rv3676 (CRP(Mt)) is a CRP family protein that regulates expression of genes (rpfA and whiB1) that are potentially involved in M. tuberculosis persistence and/or emergence from the dormant state. Here, the CRP(Mt) homodimer is shown to bind two molecules of cAMP (one per protomer) at noninteracting sites. Furthermore, cAMP binding by CRP(Mt) was relatively weak, entropy driven, and resulted in a relatively small enhancement in DNA binding. Tandem CRP(Mt)-binding sites (CRP1 at -58.5 and CRP2 at -37.5) were identified at the whiB1 promoter (PwhiB1). In vitro transcription reactions showed that CRP1 is an activating site and that CRP2, which was only occupied in the presence of cAMP or at high CRP(Mt) concentrations in the absence of cAMP, is a repressing site. Binding of CRP(Mt) to CRP1 was not essential for open complex formation but was required for transcription activation. Thus, these data suggest that binding of CRP(Mt) to the PwhiB1 CRP1 site activates transcription at a step after open complex formation. In contrast, high cAMP concentrations allowed occupation of both CRP1 and CRP2 sites, resulting in inhibition of open complex formation. Thus, M. tuberculosis CRP has evolved several distinct characteristics, compared with the Escherichia coli CRP paradigm, to allow it to regulate gene expression against a background of high concentrations of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2014247831,"Background The mechanism by which megakaryocytes (Mks) proliferate, differentiate, and release platelets into circulation are not well understood. Growing evidence indicates that a complex regulatory mechanism, involving cellular interactions, composition of the extracellular matrix and physical parameters such as oxygen tension, may contribute to the quiescent or permissive microenvironment related to Mk differentiation and maturation within the bone marrow. Methodology/Principal Findings Differentiating human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into osteoblasts (hOSTs), we established an in vitro model for the osteoblastic niche. We demonstrated for the first time that the combination of HSCs, Mks and hypoxia sustain and promote bone formation by increasing type I collagen release from hOSTs and enhancing its fibrillar organization, as revealed by second harmonic generation microscopy. Through co-culture, we demonstrated that direct cell-cell contact modulates Mk maturation and differentiation. In particular we showed that low oxygen tension and direct interaction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with hOSTs inhibits Mk maturation and proplatelet formation (PPF). This regulatory mechanism was dependent on the fibrillar structure of type I collagen released by hOSTs and on the resulting engagement of the alpha2beta1 integrin. In contrast, normoxic conditions and the direct interaction of HSCs with undifferentiated hMSCs promoted Mk maturation and PPF, through a mechanism involving the VCAM-1 pathway. Conclusions/Significance By combining cellular, physical and biochemical parameters, we mimicked an in vitro model of the osteoblastic niche that provides a physiological quiescent microenvironment where Mk differentiation and PPF are prevented. These findings serve as an important step in developing suitable in vitro systems to use for the study and manipulation of Mk differentiation and maturation in both normal and diseased states."
https://openalex.org/W2005340149,"A robust, rapid and flexible real-time PCR assay for hierarchical genetic typing of clinical and environmental isolates of Francisella is presented. Typing markers were found by multiple genome and gene comparisons, from which 23 canonical single nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNPs) and 11 canonical insertion-deletion mutations (canINDELs) were selected to provide phylogenetic guidelines for classification from genus to isolate level. The specificity of the developed assay, which uses 68 wells of a 96-well real-time PCR format with a detection limit of 100 pg DNA, was assessed using 62 Francisella isolates of diverse genetic and geographical origins. It was then successfully used for typing 14 F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates obtained from tularemia patients in Sweden in 2008 and five more genetically diverse Francisella isolates of global origins. When applied to human ulcer specimens for direct pathogen detection the results were incomplete due to scarcity of DNA, but sufficient markers were identified to detect fine-resolution differences among F. tularensis subsp. holarctica isolates causing infection in the patients. In contrast to other real-time PCR assays for Francisella, which are typically designed for specific detection of a species, subspecies, or strain, this type of assay can be easily tailored to provide appropriate phylogenetic and/or geographical resolution to meet the objectives of the analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2021575878,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important potential alternatives to conventional therapies against bacterial infections. rBPI21 is a 21 kDa peptide based on the N-terminal region of the neutrophil bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI). This AMP possesses highly selective bactericidal effects on Gram-negative bacteria and have affinity for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which is believed to be at the origin of its neutralizing effect of the LPS segregated into the bloodstream. We aim at understanding the molecular bases of rBPI21 bactericidal and LPS neutralization actions, using biomembrane model systems. Using dynamic light scattering spectroscopy we demonstrate that rBPI21 promotes aggregation of negatively charged large unilamellar vesicles (LUV), even in the absence of LPS, and LPS aggregates, while for zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (POPC) LUV the size remains unchanged. The peptide also promotes the fusion (or hemifusion) of membranes containing phosphatidylglycerol (POPG). The aggregation and fusion of negatively charged LUV are peptide concentration-dependent until massive aggregation is reached, followed by sample flocculation/precipitation. Concomitantly, there is a progressive change in the zeta-potential of the LUV systems and LPS aggregates. LUV systems composed of phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) and lipid mixtures with POPG have higher zeta-potential variations than in the absence of POPG. The interaction of rBPI21 with lipid vesicles is followed by leakage, with higher effect in POPG-containing membranes. LPS aggregation can be related with a decreased toxicity, possibly by facilitating its clearance by macrophage phagocytosis and/or blocking of LPS specific receptor recognition. Our data indicate that rBPI21 mechanism of action at the molecular level involves the interaction with the LPS of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, followed by internalization and leakage induction through the (hemi)fusion of the bacterial outer and inner membranes, both enriched in phosphatidylglycerol."

Deficiency of either mismatch repair activity renders cells highly resistant to this class of drug, but the mechanisms linking mismatch repair to checkpoint activation have remained elusive. In this study we have systematically examined the interactions of human MutSα and MutLα with proteins of the ATR-Chk1 pathway using both nuclear extracts and purified proteins. Using nuclear co-immunoprecipitation, we have detected interaction of MutSα with ATR, TopBP1, Claspin, and Chk1 and interaction of MutLα with TopBP1 and Claspin. We were unable to detect interaction of MutSα or MutLα with Rad17, Rad9, or replication protein A in the extract system. Use of purified proteins confirmed direct interaction of MutSα with ATR, TopBP1, and Chk1 and of MutLα with TopBP1. MutSα-Claspin and MutLα-Claspin interactions were not demonstrable with purified proteins, suggesting that extract interactions are indirect or depend on post-translational modification.

Peroxisome population control is achieved in part by Pex11p-dependent regulation of peroxisome size and number. Although the production of Pex11p in yeast is tightly linked to peroxisome biogenesis by transcriptional regulation of the PEX11 gene, it remains unclear if and how Pex11p activity could be modulated by rapid signaling. We report the reversible phosphorylation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pex11p in response to nutritional cues and delineate a mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent activation of Pex11p through the analysis of phosphomimicking mutants. Peroxisomal phenotypes in the PEX11-A and PEX11-D strains expressing constitutively dephosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of Pex11p resemble those of PEX11 gene knock-out and overexpression mutants, although PEX11 transcript and Pex11 protein levels remain unchanged. We demonstrate functional inequality and differences in subcellular localization of the Pex11p forms. Pex11Dp promotes peroxisome fragmentation when reexpressed in cells containing induced peroxisomes. Pex11p translocates between endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, whereas Pex11Ap and Pex11Dp are impaired in trafficking and constitutively associated with mature and proliferating peroxisomes, respectively. Overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p results in hyperphosphorylation of Pex11p and peroxisome proliferation. This study provides the first evidence for control of peroxisome dynamics by phosphorylation-dependent regulation of a peroxin."

Deregulation of these kinases leads to various pathological manifestations, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The MST1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase that is activated upon apoptotic stimulation, which in turn phosphorylates its downstream targets, Histone H2B and FOXO. However, the upstream regulators of MST1 kinase have been poorly studied. In this study, we report that JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylates MST1 at serine 82, which leads to the enhancement of MST1 activation. Accordingly, the activation of MST1 phosphorylates FOXO3 at serine 207 and promotes cell death. The inhibition of JNK kinase per se attenuates MST1 activity and nuclear translocation as well as MST1-induced apoptosis. We also find the S82A (serine mutated to alanine) diminishes MST1 activation and its effect on the FOXO transcription activity.

https://openalex.org/W2088053967,"The incidence of limb bone fracture and subsequent morbidity and mortality due to excessive bone loss is increasing in the progressively ageing populations of both men and women. In contrast to bone loss in the weight-bearing limb, bone mass in the protective skull vault is maintained. One explanation for this could be anatomically diverse bone matrix characteristics generated by heterogeneous osteoblast populations. We have tested the hypothesis that adult bones demonstrate site-specific characteristics, and report differences at the organ, cell and transcriptome levels. Limb bones contain greater amounts of polysulphated glycosaminoglycan stained with Alcian Blue and have significantly higher osteocyte densities than skull bone. Site-specific patterns persist in cultured adult bone-derived cells both phenotypically (proliferation rate, response to estrogen and cell volumes), and at the level of specific gene expression (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1, reelin and ras-like and estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor). Based on genome-wide mRNA expression and cluster analysis, we demonstrate that bones and cultured adult bone-derived cells segregate according to site of derivation. We also find the differential expression of genes associated with embryological development (Skull: Zic, Dlx, Irx, Twist1 and Cart1; Limb: Hox, Shox2, and Tbx genes) in both adult bones and isolated adult bone-derived cells. Together, these site-specific differences support the view that, analogous to different muscle types (cardiac, smooth and skeletal), skull and limb bones represent separate classes of bone. We assign these differences, not to mode of primary ossification, but to the embryological cell lineage; the basis and implications of this division are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981962627,"It has been well established that disruption of JAK2 signaling regulation is involved in various hematopoietic disorders; however, the detailed mechanism by which abnormal activation of JAK2 exhibits transforming activity remains to be elucidated. Here, to clarify the functional role of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and its downstream transcription factor STAT5 in the abnormal activation of JAK2-induced hematopoietic diseases, we generated a stable transfectant of Ba/F3 cells expressing EpoR and analyzed the molecular mechanism of how JAK2 mutation induces cell growth disorder. JAK2 V617F mutant exhibited transforming activity when EpoR was coexpressed. According to a study utilizing several truncated mutants of EpoR, the ability of EpoR to facilitate the transforming activity of JAK2 V617F mutant required the intracellular domain to interact with STAT5. Strikingly, once the truncated EpoR (EpoR-H) was mutated on Tyr-343, the phosphorylation of which is known to be important for interaction with STAT5, JAK2 V617F mutant failed to exhibit transforming activity, suggesting that STAT5 is critical for JAK2 mutant-induced hematopoietic disorder. Furthermore, the expression of the constitutively active STAT5 mutant exhibited transforming activity in Ba/F3 cells, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of STAT5 significantly inhibited the transforming activity of JAK2 V617F mutant. Taking these observations together, STAT5 plays an essential role in EpoR-JAK2 V617F mutant-induced hematopoietic disorder.

Strikingly, once the truncated EpoR (EpoR-H) was mutated on Tyr-343, the phosphorylation of which is known to be important for interaction with STAT5, JAK2 V617F mutant failed to exhibit transforming activity, suggesting that STAT5 is critical for JAK2 mutant-induced hematopoietic disorder. Furthermore, the expression of the constitutively active STAT5 mutant exhibited transforming activity in Ba/F3 cells, and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of STAT5 significantly inhibited the transforming activity of JAK2 V617F mutant. Taking these observations together, STAT5 plays an essential role in EpoR-JAK2 V617F mutant-induced hematopoietic disorder. Although it remains unclear why the presence of EpoR is required to activate oncogenic signaling via the JAK2 mutant and STAT5, its interacting ability is a target for the treatment of these hematopoietic diseases. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase JAK2 is an essential signal transducer for various cytokine signaling (1.Ihle J.N. Gilliland D.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2007; 17: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Markedly, JAK2-deficient embryos are profoundly anemic and die at around 12.5 days post-coitum, because JAK2-deficient erythroid progenitor cells exhibit a defective response to erythropoietin (Epo) 2The abbreviations used are: EpoerythropoietinEpoRerythropoietin receptorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinIRESinternal ribosome entry siteMPDsmyeloproliferative disordersMSCVmurine stem cell virusPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMFprimary myelofibrosisPVpolycythemia verashRNAshort hairpin RNAWTwild typeFLfull lengthMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinaseILinterleukinJHJAK homologyHAhemagglutininFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. stimulation and lack the ability to proliferate in response to Epo (2.Parganas E.

Once Epo binds to the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), multiple tyrosine residues of EpoR are immediately phosphorylated by activated JAK2. Tyrosine phosphorylation can trigger the association of EpoR with various signal transducers, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP-1/2, and STAT5, through specific and direct interactions with the Src homology (SH2) domain or the phosphotyrosine-binding domain of signaling molecules (4.Um M.

It has been well clarified that STAT5 binds to phosphorylated tyrosine at 343 of EpoR, and the truncated mutant of receptor harboring this tyrosine residue (EpoR-H) is sufficient to activate STAT5. When tyrosine 343 is mutated to phenylalanine, this mutant fails to activate STAT5 in response to Epo stimulation, indicating that EpoR is required to be associated with and phosphorylated by JAK2 for STAT5 activation (9.Quelle F.W.

Although the mechanism of STAT5 activation by EpoR/JAK2 has been well characterized, the physiological role of STAT5 in the proliferative signaling of EpoR remains to be elucidated. Zang et al.

H strain contains a truncation of the distal half of the cytoplasmic domain, whereas HM strain contains the same truncation as well as the point mutation of Y343F; however, both strains of mice were viable, with only slight alternations in constitutive erythropoiesis or in in vitro assays of erythrocyte progenitor function (13.Zang H. Sato K. Nakajima H. McKay C. Ney P.A. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3156-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). STAT5 activity is associated with two chromosomally colocalized genes that encode proteins that are 95% identical, STAT5a and STAT5b (14.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L.

Combining all reports, the physiological role of STAT5 in the EpoR-JAK2 signaling pathway is still uncertain. Recently, a novel somatic point mutation of JAK2 was identified in the majority of polycythemia vera (PV) patients, essential thrombocythemia patients, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients (19.James C. Ugo V. Le Couédic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garçon L. Raslova H. Berger R. Bennaceur-Griscelli A. Villeval J.L. Constantinescu S.N. Casadevall N. Vainchenker W.

Gilliland D.G. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar). This mutation is a G-C to T-A transversion at nucleotide 1849 of exon 12, resulting in the substitution of valine by phenylalanine at codon 617 (V617F). Previously, it has been reported that this JAK2 mutant was constitutively active. We also observed that JAK2 V617F mutant induced cytokine-independent survival of JAK2-deficient erythroid progenitor cells (22.Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Moritake H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Moreover, tumorigenesis was induced after injection of Ba/F3 cells expressing JAK2 V617F mutant in nude mice, suggesting that JAK2 harboring the V617F mutation is a potent oncogene able to promote cell transformation and tumorigenesis (23.Abe M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Kamishimoto J. Aizu-Yokota E. Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2009; 9: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transforming ability of JAK2 V617F mutant requires the expression of EpoR, suggesting that EpoR acts as a platform for JAK2 to exhibit proliferative signaling activity, as reported previously (24.Lu X. Levine R. Tong W. Wernig G. Pikman Y. Zarnegar S. Gilliland D.G. Lodish H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18962-18967Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, the detailed signaling pathway whereby the JAK2 V617F mutant induces transformation and tumorigenesis has hardly been addressed. In this study, to define the signaling mechanisms activated by the JAK2 V617F mutant, we addressed the role of STAT5 in the transformation induced by the JAK2 V617F mutant. Interestingly, the truncated mutant of EpoR (EpoR-H), which harbors the ability to activate STAT5, was enough to facilitate the transforming activity of the JAK2 V617F mutant; however, EpoR-H lacked this ability when the tyrosine residue required for STAT5 activation was mutated. Furthermore, by utilizing EpoR mutants and shRNAs against STAT5, we have demonstrated that STAT5 activation is necessary for tumorigenesis in nude mice induced by the JAK2 V617F mutant. In addition, a constitutively active mutant of STAT5 was able to exhibit transforming activity. These results strongly suggest that STAT5 is a critical signaling molecule for mutated JAK2-induced oncogenesis and would be an effective target of molecular therapies for diseases associated with point mutation of the JH2 domain of JAK2. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) (ESPO® 3000) and recombinant murine IL-3 were purchased from Kirin Brewery Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ), respectively. Anti-phospho-JAK2 antibody (Tyr-1007/1008), anti-phospho-STAT5 antibody (Tyr-694), anti-STAT5 antibody, anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Thr-202/Tyr-204), anti-ERK antibody, anti-phospho-Akt antibody (Ser-473), and anti-Akt antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Anti-β-actin antibody and anti-HA antibody (3F10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Murine JAK2-HA and murine EpoR c-FLAG were subcloned into retroviral plasmids, murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-Hygro, and MSCV-Puro (Clontech), respectively. Murine EpoR (H) mutant was produced by truncation of the C-terminal 108 amino acids, and the murine EpoR (HM) mutant was produced by the same truncation and a point mutation of Y343F, as described previously (13.Zang H.

MSCV-internal ribosome entry site-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-murine wild-type STAT5 and MSCV-internal ribosome entry site-GFP-murine constitutively active STAT5 mutant were donated by Dr. Ihle (St. Jude Children's Hospital). A constitutively active form of murine STAT5 cDNA harbors substitutions at amino acid residue 711 from serine to phenylalanine (S711F) and at 299 from histidine to arginine (H299R), as reported previously (25.Chin H. Nakamura N. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Ihle J.N. Miura O. Blood. 1996; 88: 4415-4425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of an amino acid residue, V617F in JAK2 was performed using a site-directed mutagenesis kit, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Ba/F3 cells were infected with empty virus (−), wild-type murine JAK2 c-HA, or a mutant of murine JAK2 c-HA (V617F) with full-length murine EpoR c-FLAG or deletion mutants of murine EpoR c-FLAG (H or HM) (1–375 amino acids) and established as described previously (22.Funakoshi-Tago M. Pelletier S. Moritake H. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1792-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells infected with EpoR-HM mutant and JAK2 V617F mutant were further infected with wild-type murine STAT5 or a constitutively active mutant of murine STAT5. Empty virus corresponding to the retrovirus expression vector of each molecule was used for all experiments. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWest, France), 2 mml-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque, Tokyo, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin (Nacalai Tesque), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque), and 2 ng/ml IL-3 or 5 units/ml Epo (Kirin Brewery Co.). To select infected cells, 5 μg/ml puromycin and 200 μg/ml hygromycin were used. To detect apoptosis, cells were incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum. Annealed oligonucleotide coding shRNA for murine STAT5 was inserted into pSUPER-retropuro retroviral plasmid (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA). The retroviral plasmid and the plasmid encoding retroviral helper were transfected into HEK293T cells using FuGENE 6. Thirty six hours after transfection, the retrovirus secreted into culture supernatant was collected. Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type JAK2 or JAK2 V617F mutant and EpoR were infected with retrovirus harboring shRNA against STAT5 using RetroNectin (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Three days later, the efficiency of knockdown was checked by immunoblot analysis for STAT5. The sequences of oligonucleotides used for constructing shRNA retroviral vectors were as follows: shRNA-1, 5′-GATCCCCCGGAGAACGAGCTGAAGAATTCAAGAGATTCTTCAGCTCGTTCTCCGTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAACGGAGAACGAGCTGAAGAATCTCTTGAATTCTTCAGCTCGTTCTCCGGGG-3′; shRNA-2, 5′-GATCCCCGCGGCGAGATCCTGAACAATTCAAGAGATTGTTCAGGATCTCGCCGCTTTTTA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGCGGCGAGATCCTGAACAATCTCTTGAATTGTTCAGGATCTCGCCGCTTTTTA-3′ (underlined sequences correspond to the sequence of murine STAT5a and STAT5b). Transduced and exponentially growing Ba/F3 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine in the presence or absence of Epo (5 units/ml) for 48 h. Living cells were counted using a Beckman Coulter VI-Cell (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Cell viability was checked by the trypan blue exclusion method (23.Abe M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Kamishimoto J. Aizu-Yokota E. Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Int. Immunopharmacol. 2009; 9: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After treatment, cells were fixed with 70% (v/v) ethanol at −20 °C overnight. Cells were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 2 min and resuspended in PBS containing 10 μg/ml RNase A (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) and 100 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma). Following a 30-min incubation, cell cycle parameters were determined by flow cytometry analysis using FACSCalibur (23.Abe M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Kamishimoto J. Aizu-Yokota E. Sonoda Y.

Fragmented DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis (23.Abe M. Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Kamishimoto J. Aizu-Yokota E. Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Int.

Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min to remove debris, and the supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibody for 4 h. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), washed three times with lysis buffer, and then eluted with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Twelve or 17 days post-inoculation, the animals were sacrificed, and the weights of the tumor, liver, and spleen were recorded. The tumors isolated from nude mice were frozen with the liquid nitrogen, and cell lysates were then prepared. After sacrifice, the liver of each nude mouse was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then dehydrated gradually in alcohol. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed for the presence of tumor cell infiltration using an OLYMPUS BX50 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with Olympus Micro DP70 software (Olympus) (26.Funakoshi-Tago M.

To investigate the function of this V617F mutation, we generated Ba/F3 cells by retroviral infection with empty virus (−) and viruses, including the wild-type JAK2 c-HA or the JAK2 mutant c-HA harboring V617F mutation (V617F) with or without retrovirus, including cDNA of the full length (FL) of EpoR c-FLAG (Fig. 1A). The characteristics of each cell strain are shown in Table 1 and designated as −/−, −/FL, WT/−, WT/FL, V617F/−, and V617F/FL cells. To test whether coexpression of EpoR could affect the function of the JAK2 V617F mutant, the phosphorylation level of its downstream molecules, including STAT5, ERK, and Akt, was examined. In the presence of EpoR, Epo stimulation induced the phosphorylation of these molecules in both −/FL and WT/FL cells. On the other hand, constitutive activation of STAT5, ERK, and Akt was observed in V617F/FL cells; however, in the absence of EpoR, not only wild-type JAK2 but also JAK2 V617F mutant failed to induce the activation of these molecules (Fig. 1B). In the absence of EpoR expression, all three cells (−/−, WT/−, and V617F/− cells) died regardless of Epo stimulation. Following Epo withdrawal, both −/FL and WT/FL cells died. On the other hand, V617F/FL cells could survive for 48 h after Epo deprivation (Fig. 1C). We next determined the different phases of cell cycle distribution in these cells following 24 h of Epo deprivation. In the absence of EpoR expression, there was a significant increase of the sub-G1 phase, which is consistent with apoptotic cells. Also, in both −/FL and WT/FL cells, cells in the sub-G1 phase were increased after Epo deprivation (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, a ladder pattern of DNA internucleosomal fragmentation clearly appeared in these cells following 24 h of Epo deprivation, confirming that these cells underwent apoptotic cell death (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, there were no marked changes in cell cycle distribution and DNA fragmentation in V617F/FL cells regardless of Epo stimulation (Fig. 1, D and E); therefore, the coexpression of EpoR with JAK2 V617F mutant conferred growth factor independence on Ba/F3 cells, as reported previously (24.Lu X.

To address the role of STAT5 activation in the function of the JAK2 V617F mutant, we further generated transduced Ba/F3 cells by retroviral infection with the empty virus (−), viruses including the wild-type JAK2 c-HA or the JAK2 V617F mutant c-HA (V617F) with retrovirus, including the full length of EpoR, and the Epo deletion mutants, EpoR-H (H) or EpoR-HM (HM). The EpoR-H mutant deleted the distal 108 amino acids of EpoR. Because the EpoR-H mutant contained one tyrosine (Tyr-343), an EpoR-HM mutant was created in which the distal region was deleted and Tyr-343 was mutated to phenylalanine (Fig. 2A). The characteristics and name of each cell strain are shown in Table 1. We first investigated whether wild-type JAK2 and JAK2 V617F mutant interacted with EpoR deletion mutants. Immunoprecipitation of EpoR mutants followed by Western blotting for JAK2 mutants demonstrated that not only wild-type JAK2 but also JAK2 V617F mutant associated with"

The protein, belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, in common to other members of this family, experiences during its folding a long-lived intermediate associated to the trans-to-cis isomerization of Pro-32 that has been addressed as the precursor of the amyloid fibril formation. In this respect, previous studies on the W60G beta2m mutant, showing that the lack of Trp-60 prevents fibril formation in mild aggregating condition, prompted us to reinvestigate the refolding kinetics of wild type and W60G beta2m at atomic resolution by real-time NMR. The analysis, conducted at ambient temperature by the band selective flip angle short transient real-time two-dimensional NMR techniques and probing the beta2m states every 15 s, revealed a more complex folding energy landscape than previously reported for wild type beta2m, involving more than a single intermediate species, and shedding new light into the fibrillogenic pathway. Moreover, a significant difference in the kinetic scheme previously characterized by optical spectroscopic methods was discovered for the W60G beta2m mutant."

Using a tandem affinity purification-based mass spectrometry screen for Cdc42 cycling factors in beta cells, RhoGDI was identified. RNA interference-mediated depletion of RhoGDI from isolated islets selectively amplified the second phase of insulin release, consistent with the role of RhoGDI as a Cdc42 cycling factor. Replenishment of RhoGDI to RNA interference-depleted cells normalized secretion, confirming the action of RhoGDI to be that of a negative regulator of Cdc42 activation. Given that RhoGDI also regulates Rac1 activation in beta cells, and that Rac1 activation occurs in a Cdc42-dependent manner, the question as to how the beta cell utilized RhoGDI for differential Cdc42 and Rac1 cycling was explored. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to determine that RhoGDI-Cdc42 complexes dissociated upon stimulation of beta cells with glucose for 3 min, correlating with the timing of glucose-induced Cdc42 activation and the onset of RhoGDI tyrosine phosphorylation. Glucose-induced disruption of RhoGDI-Rac1 complexes occurred subsequent to this, coincident with Rac1 activation, which followed the onset of RhoGDI serine phosphorylation. RhoGDI-Cdc42 complex dissociation was blocked by mutation of RhoGDI residue Tyr-156, whereas RhoGDI-Rac1 dissociation was blocked by RhoGDI mutations Y156F and S101A/S174A. Finally, expression of a triple Y156F/S101A/S174A-RhoGDI mutant specifically inhibited only the second/granule mobilization phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, overall supporting the integration of RhoGDI into the activation cycling mechanism of glucose-responsive small GTPases.

Regulated release of insulin requires two main components as follows: 1) negative regulation to ensure low levels of insulin release under resting conditions, and 2) positive regulation to facilitate robust responsiveness to elevated fuel/glucose conditions. The components of first-phase insulin release are well characterized (1.Rhodes C.J. LeRoith T. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2000: 20-38Google Scholar); glucose enters into the beta cell through the constitutively plasma membrane localized GLUT2 transporter and via its metabolism leads to a net increase in intracellular ATP/ADP ratio. This triggers closure of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel and membrane depolarization, which in turn causes the voltage-dependent calcium channel to open, allowing calcium entry (2.Cook D.L. Hales C.N.

Immediately following the first phase comes a second and sustained phase of insulin release, which is attributed to the refilling of the readily releasable pool by mobilizing intracellular insulin granule storage pools (7.Henquin J.C.

Regulation of remodeling is known to involve GDP/GTP cycling of the small Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1, both of which have been implicated in granule mobilization and sustained insulin release (13.Li J.

Earlier studies indicated that both are selectively activated in response to glucose in islets and clonal beta cell lines and that their inactivation by clostridial toxins impairs insulin release (16.Kowluru A.

Using RNAi depletion, we recently demonstrated that Cdc42 functions as a proximal regulator of second-phase insulin release from mouse islets, triggering Pak1 activation, which in turn activates Rac1 (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of effect of Cdc42 depletion upon first-phase insulin release, Cdc42 is not activated by or required for KCl-stimulated insulin release (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16.Kowluru A. Li G. Rabaglia M.E. Segu V.B. Hofmann F. Aktories K. Metz S.A. Biochem.

Furthermore, studies using a cycling-deficient Cdc42 indicated that it is the cycling of Cdc42, and not simply its activation, that is imperative for glucose-stimulated secretion (18.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Small Rho family GTPases cycle between the GDP-bound/inactive and GTP-bound/active states via the actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs). GEFs catalyze the release of bound GDP, resulting in the formation of the GTP-bound active GTPase, whereas GTPase-activating proteins stimulate GTPase activity leading to inactivation (19.Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). GDIs control the access of GTPases to GEFs, GTPase-activating proteins, and to membranes where effectors reside (20.DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2005; 15: 356-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 21.Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Interestingly, caveolin-1 functions as a GDI for Cdc42 in beta cells, interacting with the fraction of Cdc42 that localizes to the insulin granule through direct interaction with the v-SNARE VAMP2 (22.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18961-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, caveolin-1 does not suffice as the only GDI for Cdc42, given that a large proportion of Cdc42 protein resides in the soluble cytosolic fraction of the beta cell. In an effort to identify the cytosolic GDI for this pool of Cdc42, we employed a tandem affinity purification approach whereby a dual-tagged form of human Cdc42 was adenovirally introduced into MIN6 beta cells, and Cdc42-associated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. In this screen, RhoGDI was overwhelmingly found to bind to cytosolic Cdc42 in MIN6 beta cells. This identification was compatible with earlier findings by Regazzi et al. (23.Regazzi R. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that within cytosolic extracts of clonal beta cells Cdc42 co-sedimented with RhoGDI. Furthermore, RhoGDI has also been shown to function as a cytosolic GDI for Rac1 in islet beta cells, although the specific phase of secretion and their interaction in response to glucose had not been assessed (24.Kowluru A. Veluthakal R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3523-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Toward this end, we show here that RhoGDI is selectively required for control of the second sustained phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets. RNAi-mediated depletion of RhoGDI significantly enhanced glucose-induced Cdc42 activation in MIN6 cells. Acute glucose stimulation (3 min) resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of RhoGDI and transient dissociation of endogenous RhoGDI-Cdc42 complexes, whereas RhoGDI-Rac1 complexes dissociated at a later time point (by ∼20 min) and correlated with the serine phosphorylation of RhoGDI. These data pinpoint RhoGDI as a key orchestrator of the differential cycling and signaling events of cytosolic Cdc42 and Rac1 to support the second phase of insulin release. Antibodies recognizing RhoGDI, phospho-RhoGDIα (Ser-101), Cdc42, Rac1, caveolin 1, ERK, phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), actin, rabbit and mouse IgG, and protein G Plus-agarose were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

A nontargeting siRNA (siCon) was obtained from Ambion. Purified recombinant His-Cdc42, His-Rac1, and RhoGDI-GST proteins for quantitative immunoblotting analysis were purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). The full-length human Cdc42 with N-terminal Myc tag was subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3. The full-length human RhoGDIα in pcDNA3.1 was a kind gift from Dr. Anjan Kowluru. pGEX4T3-RhoGDI-WT and -Y156E plasmids were kindly provided by Drs. G. M. Bokoch and C. DerMardirossian (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and used as templates to generate PCR products to subclone into BglII and HindIII sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector. The pEGFP-RhoGDI-S101A/S174A, pEGFP-RhoGDI-Y156F, and pEGFP-RhoGDI-Y156F/S101A/S174A mutants were made using the QuikChange® Multi Site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Cedar Creek, TX). Adenoviral delivery plasmids were constructed by insertion of the annealed complementary oligonucleotide sequence of siA for RhoGDI or of siCon into the 5′-XhoI and 3′-SpeI sites of the pSilencer-Adeno-CMV vector (Ambion) using methods described previously (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). High purity cesium-chloride viral particles were obtained from Viraquest Inc. (North Liberty, IA), and viruses were packaged with GFP for use in identification of transduced islet cells in experiments. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Human Cdc42-WT cDNA was subcloned into the pNTAP shuttle vector for recombination as part of the InterPlay adenoviral tandem affinity purification system kit (Stratagene). MIN6 cells at 60% confluence were transduced with either NTAP-Cdc42WT-Ad or the control vector (TAP-CAT-Ad) CsCl-purified particles for 2 h at 37 °C (multiplicity of infection = 100) as described previously (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated 48 h longer in MIN6 culture medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. GFP fluorescence was visualized in greater than 95% of cells in all experiments. The TAP-CAT control and our TAP-Cdc42WT bait proteins were subsequently co-purified for identification of associated proteins using the Interplay tandem affinity purification kit (Stratagene) via LTQ linear ion-trap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry protein identification (INCAPS, Indianapolis, IN). Total RNA from MIN6 cells and isolated mouse pancreatic islets was obtained using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed with TaqMan (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 1% of the product was used for RT-PCR. The primers used for detection of RhoGDI isoforms (α, β, and γ) were as follows: RhoGDIα, forward 5′-cagaacaggaacccactgct and reverse 5′-cagtgctgcataccaaggtc; RhoGDIβ, forward 5′-acctggacagcaagctcaat and reverse 5′-gagatcgccagtaaggtcca; RhoGDIγ, forward 5′-gatgaggtgctggacgaaat and reverse 5′-catgatgataggccctggag. RT-PCR was performed with BioMix Red (Bioline, Taunton, MA) for 30 cycles: 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 71 °C for 1 min with a final 10-min elongation at 71 °C. PCR products were visualized on 2% agarose gels. Subcellular fractions were isolated as described previously (25.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 cells were disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle prior to centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min. Post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5500 × g for 15 min; supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the storage granule fraction. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Plasma membrane fractions were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with Buffers A and B for centrifugation at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface, which was collected for centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min to pellet the plasma membrane. All pellets were resuspended in the 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. MIN6 beta cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (25 mm glucose) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 292 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol as described previously (26.Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides into MIN6 cells was achieved as described previously (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed and incubated in glucose-free modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB: 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h prior to stimulation with 20 mmd-glucose. Cells were harvested in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 μm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For the secretion rescue assay, MIN6 cells at 50–60% confluence were co-transfected with 60 pmol of siCon or mouse siA (RhoGDI) oligonucleotides plus 0.5 μg of human proinsulin DNA (pCB6/INS, gift from Dr. Chris Newgard, Duke University, Durham, NC) and 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1- human RhoGDI plasmid (pcDNA3.1 vector as negative control) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed twice with and incubated for 2 h in freshly prepared MKRBB, followed by stimulation with 20 mmd-glucose for 1 h. MKRBB was then collected and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min for subsequent quantitation of human C-peptide secretion using a human C-peptide radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research). MIN6 cells at 50–60% confluence were co-transfected with 1 μg of pEGFP-C1 vector (control), WT, or triple mutant RhoGDI plus 1 μg of human proinsulin cDNA using Transfectin. After 48 h of incubation, cells were washed and incubated in freshly prepared MKRBB for 2 h. Cells were then either stimulated with 40 mm KCl alone or incubated with 250 μm diazoxide for 5 min, followed by addition of 40 mm KCl and then stimulated with 20 mmd-glucose. MKRBB was then collected for subsequent human C-peptide quantitation as above. The EZ-Detect Cdc42 activation kit from Pierce was used as described previously (25.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Freshly made cleared detergent cell lysate protein (500 μg) was combined with 20 μg of GST-Pak1-PDB-agarose. Following washes, proteins eluted were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting with mouse anti-Cdc42 antibody. Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated, adenovirally transduced, and used for perifusion as described previously (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, pancreata from 10- to 14-week-old male mice (C57Bl/6J) were digested with collagenase and purified using a Ficoll density gradient. After isolation, islets were immediately transduced at an multiplicity of infection = 100 with either siRhoGDI-Ad or siCon-Ad CsCl-purified particles for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2. GFP fluorescence was visualized in greater than 95% of islets in all experiments. 50 GFP-positive (GFP+) islets were handpicked onto a column between two layers of Cytodex 3 beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (magnesium-free), and preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KRBH Buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 134 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4 containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing 2.8 mm glucose. Islets were perifused at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min for 10 min in KRBH buffer containing 2.8 mm glucose with eluted fractions captured at 1-min intervals, followed by 16.7 mm glucose stimulation for 35 min. Insulin secreted into eluted fractions was quantitated by a sensitive rat insulin RIA immunoassay kit (Linco Research, Inc.). For each immunoprecipitation, 2 mg of cleared detergent lysate was combined with 2 μg of antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation reactions from cytosolic fractions used 1 mg of protein with 2 μg of antibody. Protein G Plus-agarose beads were added and reactions rotated for an additional 2 h. Following three washes with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, the resulting immunoprecipitates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting and visualization by ECL using a Chemi-Doc system (Bio-Rad). QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad) was used for quantitative analysis of immunoblots. Cytosolic fractions of MIN6 cells were subjected to electrophoresis alongside known quantities of GST-RhoGDI, His-Cdc42, and His-Rac1 recombinant proteins on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to PVDF membranes and immunoblotting with anti-RhoGDI, Cdc42, or Rac1 antibodies, respectively. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence, using exposure well within the linear range of the blot, and quantitated using the Bio-Rad Quantity One software package. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test. To identify Cdc42 cycling proteins functional in insulin-secreting beta cells, a tandem affinity purification screen using a dual-tagged form of Cdc42 was performed in clonal mouse MIN6 beta cells. MIN6 cells were transduced with control adenovirus expressing chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TAP-CAT) or TAP-Cdc42. The TAP-Cdc42 protein was immunodetected at ∼30 kDa, although endogenous Cdc42 was seen at the expected 22-kDa size (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). An additional ∼26-kDa band was present only in crude lysates and is presumed to be a degradation product of TAP-Cdc42; further purification via the dual streptavidin-binding peptide and calmodulin-binding peptide tags resulted in elimination of this product and detection of the single 30-kDa band (Fig. 1A, lane 3). This purified fraction was then subjected to mass spectrometry, resulting in detection of 46 peptides of the guanine dissociation inhibitor protein RhoGDI. RhoGDI was confirmed as a specific endogenous binding partner of Cdc42 in MIN6 beta cells by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1B). Both Cdc42 and RhoGDI proteins were detected in human islets, mouse islets, and MIN6 cells, validating use of the mouse islet and MIN6 cell model systems for subsequent studies (Fig. 1C). Of the three RhoGDI isoforms evaluated by RT-PCR analysis, RhoGDIα was predominant in both MIN6 cells and isolated mouse islets (Fig. 1D). Subcellular fractionation of MIN6 cells localized RhoGDI principally to the cytosol, similar to its localization in rat beta cells (24.Kowluru A. Veluthakal R. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 3523-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cdc42 localized to each of the three fractions, with ∼80% of total present in the cytosolic fraction. Caveolin 1 localized only to plasma membrane and storage granule fractions (Fig. 1E), consistent with its role as the GDI for the granule-localized pool of Cdc42 (22.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18961-18972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The presence of VAMP2 in the plasma membrane and storage granule fractions and exclusion from cytosol validated the fraction integrities. Cdc42-RhoGDI complexes could be co-immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 1F), implicating RhoGDI as the GDI for the cytosolic pool of Cdc42. We next determined whether the RhoGDI-Cdc42 interaction was sensitive to glucose stimulation, as would be characteristic for a GDI-GTPase interaction in beta cells. Cdc42 activation in MIN6 cells has been shown previously to reach peak activation within 3 min of glucose stimulation (14.Wang Z. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9536-9546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18.Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C698-C710Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, anti-Cdc42 co-immunoprecipitated 45% less RhoGDI from cells stimulated with glucose for 3 min than from unstimulated cleared detergent MIN6 lysates (to 0.55 ± 0.09 of basal level of RhoGDI/Cdc42 ratio, p < 0.05). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using anti-RhoGDI showed a similar response (Fig. 2B; 0.41 ± 0.06 of basal level of Cdc42/RhoGDI ratio, p < 0.05). This decrease was fully recapitulated using only the cytosolic fraction for co-immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These data suggested a role for RhoGDI as the glucose-sensitive cytosolic Cdc42 guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor proteins bind to inactive GTPases. To determine whether RhoGDI was required to maintain inactivation of cytosolic Cdc42, RNAi-mediated depletion of endogenous RhoGDIα was employed. Three different siRNA oligonucleotides (siA, siB, and siC) were capable of reducing endogenous RhoGDI levels, with siA exerting the most efficient protein knockdown (Fig. 3A); siA was thereafter utilized in all subsequent assays. In Cdc42 activation assays, RhoGDI depletion was without effect relative to that from nontargeted siCon-transfected cell lysates under basal, unstimulated conditions (Fig. 3B; 1.2 ± 0.1 versus 1.0, respectively). Conversely, activated Cdc42 levels in glucose-stimulated (3 min) RhoGDI-depleted cells were significantly elevated (Fig. 3B; 2.5 ± 0.2 versus 1.9 ± 0.1-fold increase of siCon-depleted cells, p < 0.05, n = 3). This is in contrast to caveolin-1 depletion, which induced a 2 ± 0.2-fold increase in activated Cdc42 under basal conditions compared with control (p < 0.05) but failed to exert a change with glucose stimulation (2 ± 0.3-fold, n = 3). These data indicated that RhoGDI functioned as a guanine nucleotide inhibitor of Cdc42 activation in MIN6 cells, in a manner distinct from that served by the Cdc42 granule-localized GDI protein, caveolin-1. Rac1 activation in either control- or RhoGDI-depleted cells was unaffected at either of these time points (data not shown). To determine the requirement for RhoGDI in biphasic insulin secretion, islet perifusion was employed. RNAi-mediated RhoGDI depletion was used rather than islets isolated from RhoGDIα(−/−) knock-out mice because these mice are reported to exhibit severe metabolic abnormalities and infertility (28.Togawa A. Miyoshi J. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Takakura A. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Doi T. Mizoguchi A. Matsuura N. Niho Y. Nishimune Y. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5373-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As such, freshly isolated C57Bl/6J mouse islets were transduced with either RhoGDI siRNA (siRhoGDI-Ad) or control siRNA (siCon-Ad) and 40 h later were perifused, and insulin secretion was monitored.

Under-prenylation of certain Rabs, as a result of loss of function mutations in REP-1, could affect vesicular trafficking, exocytosis and secretion in peripheral cells of CHM patients.To evaluate this hypothesis, intracellular vesicle transport, lysosomal acidification and rates of proteolytic degradation were studied in monocytes (CD14+ fraction) and primary skin fibroblasts from the nine age-matched controls and thirteen CHM patients carrying 10 different loss-of-function mutations. With the use of pHrodo BioParticles conjugated with E. coli, collagen I coated FluoSpheres beads and fluorescent DQ ovalbumin with BODYPY FL dye, we demonstrated for the first time that lysosomal pH was increased in monocytes of CHM patients and, as a consequence, the rates of proteolytic degradation were slowed. Microarray analysis of gene expression revealed that some genes involved in the immune response, small GTPase regulation, transcription, cell adhesion and the regulation of exocytosis were significantly up and down regulated in cells from CHM patients compared to controls. Finally, CHM fibroblasts secreted significantly lower levels of cytokine/growth factors such as macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), pigment epithelial derived factor (PEDF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) beta and interleukin (lL)-8.We demonstrated for the first time that peripheral cells of CHM patients had increased pH levels in lysosomes, reduced rates of proteolytic degradation and altered secretion of cytokines. Peripheral cells from CHM patients expose characteristics that were not previously recognized and could used as an alternative models to study the effects of different mutations in the REP-1 gene on mechanism of CHM development in human population."
https://openalex.org/W1964497830,"Background Paraxial protocadherin (PAPC) and fibronectin leucine-rich domain transmembrane protein-3 (FLRT3) are induced by TGFβ signaling in Xenopus embryos and both regulate morphogenesis by inhibiting C-cadherin mediated cell adhesion. Principal Findings We have investigated the functional and physical relationships between PAPC, FLRT3, and C-cadherin. Although neither PAPC nor FLRT3 are required for each other to regulate C-cadherin adhesion, they do interact functionally and physically, and they form a complex with cadherins. By itself PAPC reduces cell adhesion physiologically to induce cell sorting, while FLRT3 disrupts adhesion excessively to cause cell dissociation. However, when expressed together PAPC limits the cell dissociating and tissue disrupting activity of FLRT3 to make it effective in physiological cell sorting. PAPC counteracts FLRT3 function by inhibiting the recruitment of the GTPase RND1 to the FLRT3 cytoplasmic domain. Conclusions/Significance PAPC and FLRT3 form a functional complex with cadherins and PAPC functions as a molecular “governor” to maintain FLRT3 activity at the optimal level for physiological regulation of C-cadherin adhesion, cell sorting, and morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2090416880,"Cytosolic fungal fatty acid synthase is composed of two subunits α and β, which are encoded by Fas1 and Fas2 genes. In this study, the Fas2 genes of the human pathogen Candida parapsilosis were deleted using a modified SAT1 flipper technique. CpFas2 was essential in media lacking exogenous fatty acids and the growth of Fas2 disruptants (Fas2 KO) was regulated by the supplementation of different long chain fatty acids, such as myristic acid (14∶0), palmitic acid (16∶0), and Tween 80, in a dose-specific manner. Lipidomic analysis revealed that Fas2 KO cells were severely restricted in production of unsaturated fatty acids. The Fas2 KO strains were unable to form normal biofilms and were more efficiently killed by murine-like macrophages, J774.16, than the wild type, heterozygous and reconstituted strains. Furthermore, Fas2 KO yeast were significantly less virulent in a systemic murine infection model. The Fas2 KO cells were also hypersensitive to human serum, and inhibition of CpFas2 in WT C. parapsilosis by cerulenin significantly decreased fungal growth in human serum. This study demonstrates that CpFas2 is essential for C. parapsilosis growth in the absence of exogenous fatty acids, is involved in unsaturated fatty acid production, influences fungal virulence, and represents a promising antifungal drug target."
https://openalex.org/W1991262083,"Human height is the prototypical polygenic quantitative trait. Recently, several genetic variants influencing adult height were identified, primarily in individuals of East Asian (Chinese Han or Korean) or European ancestry. Here, we examined 152 genetic variants representing 107 independent loci previously associated with adult height for transferability in a well-powered sample of 1,016 unrelated African Americans. When we tested just the reported variants originally identified as associated with adult height in individuals of East Asian or European ancestry, only 8.3% of these loci transferred (p-values≤0.05 under an additive genetic model with directionally consistent effects) to our African American sample. However, when we comprehensively evaluated all HapMap variants in linkage disequilibrium (r2≥0.3) with the reported variants, the transferability rate increased to 54.1%. The transferability rate was 70.8% for associations originally reported as genome-wide significant and 38.0% for associations originally reported as suggestive. An additional 23 loci were significantly associated but failed to transfer because of directionally inconsistent effects. Six loci were associated with adult height in all three groups. Using differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns between HapMap CEU or CHB reference data and our African American sample, we fine-mapped these six loci, improving both the localization and the annotation of these transferable associations."
https://openalex.org/W2066433230,"Although the small GTPase Ran is best known for its roles in nucleocytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle assembly, and nuclear envelope formation, recent studies have demonstrated the overexpression of Ran in multiple tumor types and that its expression is correlated with a poor patient prognosis, providing evidence for the importance of this GTPase in cell growth regulation. Here we show that Ran is subject to growth factor regulation by demonstrating that it is activated in a serum-dependent manner in human breast cancer cells and, in particular, in response to heregulin, a growth factor that activates the Neu/ErbB2 tyrosine kinase. The heregulin-dependent activation of Ran requires mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and stimulates the capped RNA binding capability of the cap-binding complex in the nucleus, thus influencing gene expression at the level of mRNA processing. We further demonstrate that the excessive activation of Ran has important consequences for cell growth by showing that a novel, activated Ran mutant is sufficient to transform NIH-3T3 cells in an mTOR- and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent manner and that Ran-transformed cells form tumors in mice.

Ran is a unique member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases that utilizes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (the chromatin-associated RCC1 protein), a GTPase-accelerating protein complex (RanGAP/RanBP1), and a single major class of effectors (the importins or karyopherins) to regulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of various cargo as well as other nuclear functions (for review, see Ref. 1.Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). In interphase cells, a Ran-GTP gradient is formed in response to the nuclear localization of RCC1 together with the cytoplasmic localization of RanGAP. As a result, Ran exists predominantly in an active, GTP-bound state in the nucleus where it is capable of engaging its primary biological effectors, the importins/karyopherins. GTP hydrolysis, catalyzed by RanGAP in the cytoplasm, then results in the dissociation of Ran-GDP from its effector proteins. The nucleocytoplasmic transport of a number of proteins is dependent upon the proper establishment of the Ran-GTP gradient, as best exemplified in the case of classical nuclear import (2.Stewart M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). Protein cargo destined for the nucleus is identified by the presence of a nuclear localization sequence. The nuclear localization sequence is recognized by an adapter protein, importin-α, in the cytosol, and upon binding the cargo, importin-α engages importin-β to form a complete import complex that translocates to the nucleus. Within the nucleus, Ran-GTP binds to importin-β, causing it to dissociate from the import complex, which results in the subsequent release of cargo. Thus, the fact that Ran-GTP is predominantly a nuclear species is pivotal in the directional release of import cargo into the nucleus. Similarly, it has been suggested that Ran plays an essential role in the directional release of capped RNAs in the cytoplasm by regulating the interactions that occur between the nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) 2The abbreviations used are: CBCnuclear cap-binding complexHRGheregulinS6KS6 kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorEGFREGF receptoreIFeukaryotic translation initiation factorERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumWTwild typeGTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateshRNAsmall hairpin RNAPDGFRplatelet-derived growth factor receptormTORmammalian target of rapamycin. and the importins (3.Görlich D.

The CBC (comprised of two subunits, CBP20 and CBP80) binds cotranscriptionally to the monomethylated guanosine cap structure (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)N) of RNA polymerase II-transcribed RNAs (4.Izaurralde E.

The CBC-importin-α complex is able to bind capped RNA with high affinity, whereas the inclusion of importin-β into this complex greatly reduces the affinity of the CBC for capped RNA (3.Görlich D.

The interphase Ran-GTP gradient would favor the formation of a nuclear CBC-importin-α complex and a cytosolic CBC-importin-α-importin-β complex, thereby providing a mechanism to promote the directed release of CBC-associated RNAs into the cytoplasm (3.Görlich D.

Moreover, recently we showed that the growth factor regulation of the cap binding capability of the CBC is dependent on its interactions with the importins (14.Dias S.M. Wilson K.F. Rojas K.S. Ambrosio A.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings, when considered together with the role played by Ran-GTP in regulating the interactions between the importins and the CBC, would suggest that the formation of the Ran-GTP gradient in cells is also subject to growth factor regulation. The possibility that Ran is a downstream signaling target of growth factors is especially intriguing, given the growing body of evidence that correlates Ran expression with tumorigenesis (for review, see Ref. 17.Rensen W.M. Mangiacasale R. Ciciarello M. Lavia P. Front. Biosci. 2008; 13: 4097-4121Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, in the present study, we set out to establish that Ran-GTP levels can be regulated by serum and in particular by the growth factor HRG, because we have shown it to be very effective at activating the CBC in cells (14.Dias S.M. Wilson K.F. Rojas K.S. Ambrosio A.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15.Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 37307-37310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We used the human breast cancer SKBR3 cell line as a model system because it responds to both HRG and EGF, and it exhibits a specific HRG-stimulated activation of the CBC. Here we show that both serum and HRG treatment are in fact able to activate Ran in an mTOR-dependent manner in the nucleus of these breast cancer cells and that one functional consequence of Ran activation is an increase in capped RNA binding by the CBC. We further examined the consequences of increased Ran activation in cell growth control through the use of a novel, activated Ran mutant (Ran (F35A)). We show that this Ran mutant can induce the transformation of NIH-3T3 cells as read out by a number of assays and that the injection of Ran-transformed cells into mice caused tumor formation. Interestingly, we discovered that increasing the levels of active Ran in cells through the expression of Ran (F35A) triggers the rapamycin-sensitive activation of multiple signaling proteins including the EGFR, Ras, and ERK and that cellular transformation induced by Ran (F35A) was dependent on activated EGFRs. These findings suggest that a potentially important consequence of the activation of Ran and its effects on enhancing CBC-dependent RNA-processing/gene expression is ultimately the production of growth regulatory proteins and/or growth factors (i.e. EGF) that result in excessive signaling through the EGFR. When taken together, these findings highlight Ran as a small GTPase that, like the Ras and Rho proteins, comes under strict growth factor regulation, and the loss of this regulation can have important consequences for cell growth control and give rise to oncogenic transformation. V5 and BrdUrd antibodies and Hoechst 33342 were obtained from Invitrogen. The Ran and RanBP1 antibodies were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, as well as antibodies against mTOR, p70 S6K, EGFR, PDGFR, RCC1, and Ras antibodies were from Upstate, as was glutathione S-transferase-Ras. The phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), phospho-S6K (Thr389), and ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling. RanGAP1 antibody was from Novus. The His6 and hemagglutinin antibodies were from Covance, and the Oregon Green anti-mouse was from Molecular Probes. [α-32P]GTP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rapamycin and AG1478 were from Calbiochem. SKBR3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to growth factor treatment, the cells were switched to serum-free medium for 5 days. Growth factors, including 100 nm heregulin β1 (residues 177–244; a generous gift from Dr. Mark Sliwkowski, Genentech), 100 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), or 20% fetal bovine serum, were then added to the serum-free medium for the time periods indicated under “Results” at 37 °C. Following treatment, the growth factor-containing medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed (see below). Transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. To generate stable cell lines, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with the various pcDNA3.1-V5-Neo vectors, either alone or incorporating various Ran constructs, using the Lipofectamine transfection kit (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum and 750 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 10–14 days, G418-resistant colonies were selected and subcultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 750–875 μg/ml G418. The clones were then assessed for the expression of Ran. For analyses of S phase entry, subconfluent cells stably expressing Ran were plated in sterile 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were maintained in low serum (0.5% calf serum) for an additional 24 h, and then 2–4 × 104 cells were replated onto sterile chamber well slides in 10% calf serum and 200 μm BrdUrd. After 10 h, the cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody, anti-V5 polyclonal antibody, and Hoechst, as described previously (18.Melkoumian Z.K. Peng X. Gan B. Wu X. Guan J.L. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6676-6684Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was determined for more than 400 cells from multiple fields for each experiment. Cell fractionation and lysis were performed as previously described (15.Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

When preparing lysates for Ran pulldown assays, dithiothreitol and EDTA were omitted from all lysis buffers. Cell lines stably expressing Ran were serum-starved for 40–48 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum. The serum-starved cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in MLB buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotonin). The lysates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 13,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. One mg of lysate was then allowed to incubate overnight at 4 °C with an anti-EGFR or anti-PDGFR antibody. Following the primary antibody incubation, 60 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (slurry) were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged, and the immunoprecipitated pellets were washed (three times) with MLB buffer. The samples were mixed with 5× Laemmli buffer and boiled. SDS-PAGE was performed using 7.5% acrylamide gels followed by transfer to nitrocellulose filters and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Photoaffinity labeling of cellular proteins with [α-32P]GTP was performed as described previously (15.Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence, NIH-3T3 cells were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/well in chamber well slides (Nalgene), grown in complete medium for 1 day, and then transiently transfected with V5-tagged Ran constructs. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 24 h post-transfection and were then washed and processed as described previously (14.Dias S.M. Wilson K.F. Rojas K.S. Ambrosio A.L. Cerione R.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Ran expression was visualized using an anti-V5 antibody, and the nuclei were stained using Hoescht dye. Activation of cellular Ras was assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ras activation assay kit; Upstate). A Ras antibody (Upstate) was used for Western blotting. RNA interference knockdown experiments were performed in SKBR3 cells. The knockdown of mTOR was performed using SignalSilence mTOR siRNA (Cell Signaling). SignalSilence Control siRNA was used as the negative control. The RNA interference oligonucleotides were transiently transfected in SKBR3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000, and the relative knockdown efficiency was determined using antibodies against mTOR. A pKD-p70 S6K construct (Upstate) producing shRNAs directed against human p70 S6K was transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). A pKD-NegCon-v1 construct (Upstate) producing negative control shRNA was used as the control siRNA expression plasmid. Relative knockdown efficiencies were analyzed by probing the transfected lysates with an antibody directed against p70 S6K. To determine the growth rates in low serum, 10 × 104 NIH-3T3 cells expressing vector, wild type Ran, or various Ran mutants were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. After 5 h, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.5% calf serum, which was changed daily. At the indicated times, the cells were trypsinized and counted on a hemacytometer. The data represent the averages of three different experiments. When assaying the ability of cells to grow to high density, the different cell lines of interest (10 × 104 cells) were cultured in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 5% calf serum, which was replaced every other day. Saturation density was determined by counting the cells, as described above, 2 days after culture confluence (6–8 days total). The data are the averages of at least three independent experiments. To determine the ability of the different Ran-expressing cell lines to grow in semi-solid agar, 10 × 104 cells from the different clones were mixed with DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose and plated on a solidified layer of DMEM supplemented with 0.5% agarose and 10% calf serum. The cells were fed weekly by adding 1 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 0.3% agarose. After 2 weeks, colonies larger than 50 μm were scored under a microscope. The data are the averages of three independent experiments. Six-week-old NIH-III nude male mice (Charles River Diagnostics) were used to assess the ability of NIH-3T3 cells expressing either wild type Ran or Ran (F35A) to form tumors. All of the study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cornell University and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the United States National Institutes of Health. The cells were harvested and resuspended in DMEM and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 1 × 106 cells/ml. From this suspension, 200 μl were injected subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of the mouse. After 60 days, the mice were euthanized, and the tumors were excised and weighed. The tumors were then fixed with 10% formalin, and sections of 4 μm were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine histopathological examination by light microscopy. Importin-β was cloned by PCR from untagged importin-β (a generous gift from Dr. Iain Mattaj, EMBL). The 5′- and 3′-primers were designed using the published sequence for human importin-β (GenBank™ accession number AAC41763). Restriction sites (5′ BamHI and 3′ NotI) were introduced to facilitate cloning. The importin-β gene was then amplified using 30 PCR cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, and 6 min at 72 °C). The PCR product was inserted into a cloning vector (pCR2.1) using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pet28a immediately downstream of the hexahistidine tag using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science). V5-WT Ran was cloned by PCR from pGEX-KG-Ran (a generous gift from Dr. Alfred Wittinghofer, Max-Planck Institut für Molekulare Physiology). The 5′- and 3′-primers were designed from the published sequence for human Ran (GenBank™ accession number NM_006325), and the Ran gene was amplified using PCR and inserted into the pcDNA 3.1D/V5/His-TOPO plasmid according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to generate the Ran (F35A) and Ran (T24N) mutants. His6-importin-β was expressed in E. coli and affinity-purified on Nickel-chelating Sepharose beads. For the assay, the His6-importin-β proteins were reattached to the beads (15 μl/sample, ∼10 μg of fusion protein) at room temperature for 20 min, and the beads were washed twice with Ran pulldown buffer (equal volumes of cytoplasmic and nuclear lysis buffers). Nuclear lysates (precleared with nickel-chelating Sepharose beads) were adjusted to 500 μl with Ran pulldown buffer and then added to the beads. The lysates were incubated with the His6-importin-β-bound proteins at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h. The nickel-chelating Sepharose beads were pelleted, washed (three times) with 1 ml of Ran pulldown buffer plus 100 mm imidazole to eliminate background binding of nonspecific proteins, and then resuspended in 5× Laemmli buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Splicing extracts were prepared from NIH-3T3 cells stably expressing Ran (F35A) or vector alone that were grown in 1% calf serum for 24 h. The splicing reactions were then carried out as described previously (15.Wilson K.F. Fortes P. Singh U.S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4166-4173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted utilizing the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from cells that were serum-starved for 20–24 h. Complimentary DNA was synthesized using the SABiosciences RT2 first strand kit. Quantitative PCR was performed in triplicate using primer sets to amplify EGF, the gene of interest (SABiosciences RT2 PCR primer assay for mouse EGF with RT2 SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix) and mouse GAPDH, the normalizer/housekeeping gene. Controls (i.e. no reverse transcriptase and no template controls) were prepared to exclude the possibility of amplification coming from genomic DNA contamination. Thermal cycling was carried out on an ABI7500 fast real time PCR system starting with one cycle at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The entire procedure was replicated (three times) on independent RNA isolations. Relative quantification studies were performed with the ABI7500 fast system sequence detection software, and the statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. To determine whether Ran is subject to growth factor regulation, we took advantage of an assay that is capable of detecting changes in the activation status of Ran in cells. This involved the use of a His6-importin-β fusion protein that serves as a specific binding partner for activated (GTP-bound) forms of Ran. A similar assay has been used previously to read out Ran activation (19.Yasuda Y. Miyamoto Y. Saiwaki T. Yoneda Y. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20.Yudin D. Hanz S. Yoo S. Iavnilovitch E. Willis D. Gradus T. Vuppalanchi D. Segal-Ruder Y. Ben-Yaakov K. Hieda M. Yoneda Y. Twiss J.L. Fainzilber M. Neuron. 2008; 59: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as well as to assess the activation of a variety of small GTPases including Ras and Rho family members (21.Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We verified the validity of this assay system for Ran activation in a number of ways. First, we showed that His6-importin-β selectively precipitates a recombinant, constitutively active Ran mutant, Ran (Q69L), as compared with wild type Ran (RanWT) in either its GDP-bound or nucleotide-free form in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1A, bottom panel). Next, we treated nuclear extracts from SKBR3 cells with EDTA to strip guanine nucleotides from the GTPases present in these fractions and then reloaded them with either GDP or GTPγS. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1B (bottom panel), Ran was selectively precipitated by His6-importin-β from nuclear extracts loaded with GTPγS but not from extracts loaded with GDP. Finally, to ensure the integrity of Ran-GTP in the nuclear lysates during the course of the assay, we examined the ability of increasing amounts of recombinant Ran loaded with [γ-32P]GTP to be precipitated with His6-importin-β in the presence or absence of nuclear lysates. The top panel in supplemental Fig. S1C depicts an autoradiogram showing the input levels of Ran-[γ-32P]GTP, whereas the middle and bottom panels are autoradiograms of Ran-[γ-32P]GTP precipitated in the absence or presence of nuclear lysates, respectively. The equal precipitation of Ran- [γ-32P]GTP under these two conditions shows that Ran-GTP is not hydrolyzed during the course of these experiments. We then examined whether serum-starved SKBR3 cells, a human breast cancer cell line that expresses high levels of EGFR family members when treated with serum or the growth factors HRG or EGF, showed increased cellular levels of Ran-GTP. Following 24 h of stimulation, cells were harvested and fractionated, and the nuclear fractions were assayed for Ran activation using recombinant His6-importin-β as a probe for Ran-GTP as described above. As shown in Fig. 1A (middle panel), Ran-GTP levels were increased significantly in response to treatment with either serum or HRG, whereas there was little change in the amount of activated Ran following the addition of EGF. The HRG-dependent activation of Ran was dose-dependent with maximal effects occurring at 100 nm HRG (Fig. 1B, middle panel) and peaked after 45 min of treatment (Fig. 1C, middle panel), whereas EGF was ineffective through 180 min despite giving rise to a clearly detectable activation of ERK (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). The changes in the levels of Ran-GTP were not a consequence of effects on Ran expression, because the cellular levels of Ran remained constant throughout the time period of the experiment (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Similarly, these results were not due to changes in either the expression levels or the localization of the key Ran regulatory proteins, RCC1, RanGAP, or RanBP1 (Fig. 1D). The finding that HRG was a more potent activator of Ran than EGF was consistent with Ran playing a role in signaling to the CBC, because HRG shows a stronger capability for regulating CBC activity compared with EGF. Indeed, the transient expression of the dominant active, GTP hydrolysis-defective Ran (Q69L) mutant in SKBR3 cells circumvents the need for growth factor stimulation and strongly activates the CBC. This can be read out by the incorporation of [α-32P]GTP (which serves as a radiolabeled cap analog) into the cap-binding site of the CBP20 subunit in nuclear lysates from serum-starved cells (Fig. 1E, middle panel). Because we had previously shown that the ability of HRG to regulate the CBC was mediated by mTOR (16.Wilson K.F. Wu W.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37307-37310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we examined whether the HRG-dependent activation of Ran was also dependent on mTOR activity. SKBR3 cells were transfected with either a control siRNA or a validated, mTOR-specific siRNA, serum-starved, and then treated with HRG for 1 h. The cells were harvested and fractionated, with the cytoplasmic lysates being used to determine both knockdown efficiency and p70 S6K activity by Western blotting, whereas the nuclear lysates were used to assay Ran activation via the His6-importin-β pulldown assay. As shown in Fig. 1F, the knockdown of mTOR was very effective at abrogating both the HRG-dependent activation of p70 S6K (second panel from the top) and Ran (bottom panel). Likewise, knocking down p70 S6K using an shRNA (Fig. 1G, top panel) blocked HRG signaling to Ran (Fig. 1G, bottom panel). Given that Ran is activated downstream of a HRG signaling pathway in breast cancer cells, we wanted to examine the consequences of losing this regulation, as would occur by introducing an activated Ran mutant into cells. In particular, we were interested in seeing whether such an activated Ran mutant would be capable of stimulating cell"
https://openalex.org/W2010743087,"Background Trauma/hemorrhagic shock (T/HS) results in cytokine-mediated acute inflammation that is generally considered detrimental. Methodology/Principal Findings Paradoxically, plasma levels of the early inflammatory cytokine TNF-α (but not IL-6, IL-10, or NO2-/NO3-) were significantly elevated within 6 h post-admission in 19 human trauma survivors vs. 4 non-survivors. Moreover, plasma TNF-α was inversely correlated with Marshall Score, an index of organ dysfunction, both in the 23 patients taken together and in the survivor cohort. Accordingly, we hypothesized that if an early, robust pro-inflammatory response were to be a marker of an appropriate response to injury, then individuals exhibiting such a response would be predisposed to survive. We tested this hypothesis in swine subjected to various experimental paradigms of T/HS. Twenty-three anesthetized pigs were subjected to T/HS (12 HS-only and 11 HS + Thoracotomy; mean arterial pressure of 30 mmHg for 45–90 min) along with surgery-only controls. Plasma obtained at pre-surgery, baseline post-surgery, beginning of HS, and every 15 min thereafter until 75 min (in the HS only group) or 90 min (in the HS + Thoracotomy group) was assayed for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and NO2-/NO3-. Mean post-surgery±HS TNF-α levels were significantly higher in the survivors vs. non-survivors, while non-survivors exhibited no measurable change in TNF-α levels over the same interval. Conclusions/Significance Contrary to the current dogma, survival in the setting of severe, acute T/HS appears to be associated with an immediate increase in serum TNF-α. It is currently unclear if this response was the cause of this protection, a marker of survival, or both.

https://openalex.org/W1979046532,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) comprise a family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that control diverse critical biological processes including various aspects of brain development. Eighteen NR genes exist in the Drosophila genome. To explore their roles in brain development, we knocked down individual NRs through the development of the mushroom bodies (MBs) by targeted RNAi. Besides recapitulating the known MB phenotypes for three NRs, we found that unfulfilled (unf), an ortholog of human photoreceptor specific nuclear receptor (PNR), regulates axonal morphogenesis and neuronal subtype identity. The adult MBs develop through remodeling of gamma neurons plus de-novo elaboration of both alpha'/beta' and alpha/beta neurons. Notably, unf is largely dispensable for the initial elaboration of gamma neurons, but plays an essential role in their re-extension of axons after pruning during early metamorphosis. The subsequently derived MB neuron types also require unf for extension of axons beyond the terminus of the pruned bundle. Tracing single axons revealed misrouting rather than simple truncation. Further, silencing unf in single-cell clones elicited misguidance of axons in otherwise unperturbed MBs. Such axon guidance defects may occur as MB neurons partially lose their subtype identity, as evidenced by suppression of various MB subtype markers in unf knockdown MBs. In sum, unf governs axonal morphogenesis of multiple MB neuron types, possibly through regulating neuronal subtype identity."
https://openalex.org/W2016931774,"The human negative elongation factor (NELF) is a four-subunit protein complex that inhibits the movement of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at an early elongation stage in vitro. NELF-mediated stalling of RNAPII also attenuates transcription of a number of inducible genes in human cells. To obtain a genome-wide understanding of human NELF-mediated transcriptional regulation in vivo, we carried out an exon array study in T47D breast cancer cells with transient small interfering RNA knockdown of individual NELF subunits. Upon depletion of NELF-A, -C, or -E, the vast majority of NELF-regulated genes were down-regulated. Many of the down-regulated genes encode proteins that play key roles in cell cycle progression. Consequently, NELF knockdown resulted in significant reduction in DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that NELF knockdown led to dissociation of RNAPII from the promoter-proximal region of the cell cycle-regulating genes. This was accompanied by decreased histone modifications associated with active transcription initiation (H3K9Ac) and elongation (H3K36Me3), as well as reduced recruitment of the general transcription factor TFIIB and increased overall histone occupancy at a subset of the down-regulated promoters. Lastly, our study indicates that NELF regulates alternative transcription initiation of BSG (Basigin) gene by differentially influencing RNAPII density at the two neighboring exons at the 5′ end of the gene.

Historically, mechanistic studies of eukaryotic gene regulation have predominantly been focused on the control of transcription initiation (1.Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2004; 116: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Until recently, the prevailing view was that assembly of the preinitiation complex (PIC) 2The abbreviations used are: PICpreinitiation complexNELFnegative elongation factorRNAPIIRNA polymerase IIsiRNAsmall interfering RNARTreverse transcriptionChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridinePBSphosphate-buffered saline. that contains RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at the promoter region was the most critical step in transcription of the vast majority of eukaryotic genes. However, recent genome-wide examination of the physical distribution of RNAPII along the chromosomes in mammals and Drosophila has led to the unexpected finding that RNAPII is enriched at the promoter-proximal regions of a large portion of both transcriptionally active and inactive genes (2.Guenther M.G.

It has been suggested that paused RNAPII keeps the silenced genes in a transcriptionally “poised” state, which can be rapidly activated in response to various environmental and developmental cues (6.Glover-Cutter K. Kim S. Espinosa J. Bentley D.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).

NELF was biochemically characterized as a regulatory complex for RNAPII movement during transcription elongation (7.Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Together with 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribobenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor, NELF interacts with the hypophosphorylated form of RNAPII (IIa) and stalls it at an early stage of elongation in an in vitro transcription system (7.Yamaguchi Y.

The inhibitory effect of NELF on RNAPII elongation is alleviated by the positive transcription elongation factor-b (7.Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell. 1999; 97: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates serine 2 of the C-terminal domain of RNAPII. Phosphorylation of 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribobenzimidazole sensitivity-inducing factor and NELF by the positive transcription elongation factor-b is also thought to contribute to the release of RNAPII from the stalled mode (9.Marshall N.F.

NELF can modulate basal and/or induced transcription of these genes, depending on the gene and cell context. Genome-wide investigation of Drosophila NELF indicates that NELF is recruited to a large number of Drosophila genes (19.Lee C. Li X. Hechmer A. Eisen M. Biggin M.D. Venters B.J. Jiang C. Li J. Pugh B.F. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell.

Interestingly, almost half of the most highly expressed genes in Drosophila cells are associated with NELF (19.Lee C. Li X. Hechmer A. Eisen M. Biggin M.D. Venters B.J. Jiang C. Li J. Pugh B.F. Gilmour D.S. Mol. Cell.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2007; 107: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus NELF may have a broader impact on multiple aspects of gene regulation than indicated by the initial biochemical studies in vitro. In the current study, we used an exon array to examine the functional impact of NELF on the abundance of mRNA transcripts at the levels of individual exons in the human genome. Our data uncovered an important role for NELF in sustaining transcription of a large number of cell cycle-regulating genes. The whole genome study also suggests that NELF regulates the usage of alternative promoters in the human genome. Human breast cancer cell line T47D was obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The following antibodies used in chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were commercially available: anti-RNAPII (H224, sc-9001x; Santa Cruz), anti-RNAPII C-terminal domain phospho-S2 (ab5095; Abcam), anti-RNAPII C-terminal domain phospho S5 (ab5131; Abcam), anti-TFIIB (sc-225x; Santa Cruz), anti-histone H3 (2650; Cell Signaling), anti-histone H3 acetyl K9 (ab4441; Abcam), anti-histone H3 trimethyl K4 (ab8580; Abcam), anti-histone H3 trimethyl K36 (ab9050; Abcam), and anti-α-tubulin (CP06; CalBiochem). Anti-NELF-A, -B, -C, and -E antibodies used in the Western blot analysis and ChIP assay have been previously described (17.Aiyar S.E. Sun J.L. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C.A. Lu Y.Z. Ye Q.N. Yamaguchi Y.

Primer sequences and their positions in the corresponding genes are listed in supplemental Table S1. siRNAs targeting the individual NELF subunits and luciferase control have been previously described (25.Sun J. Watkins G. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C. Ghosh S. Jiang W.G. Li R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transfection of the siRNA duplex into T47D cells was carried out by using RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1.5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm culture dish were transfected with 10 nm of siRNA duplex with 15 μl of RNAiMAX reagent. Growth medium was replenished 48 h after transfection, and the cells were allowed to grow for additional 48 h before harvest. The procedures for extraction of total RNA and protein, RT-PCR analysis, and Western blot analysis have been previously described (17.Aiyar S.E. Sun J.L. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C.A. Lu Y.Z. Ye Q.N. Yamaguchi Y. Mukherjee A. Ren D.M. Handa H. Li R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2134-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Human GeneChip Exon 1.0 ST Array was purchased from Affymetrix. The service for RNA processing and labeling, array hybridization, and scanning was provided by Expression Analysis Inc. (Durham, NC), using whole transcript sense target labeling and control reagents (900652; Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The RNA samples were prepared from T47D cells 96 h after transfection with siRNA oligonucleotides for the control and individual NELF subunits. Triplicates were made for each condition. 1 μg of total RNA from each sample was used to generate labeled probes for array hybridization. The quality of isolated RNA was first measured by Bioanalyzer QC assay (Agilent). Ribosomal RNA was then removed with the RiboMinus Kit (Invitrogen), and the reduction efficiency was verified by capillary electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized from the resultant RNA followed by amplification, fragmentation, and terminal labeling. The array was hybridized with the labeled targets, washed, and scanned for data collection. The exon array data were analyzed using ArrayAssist (Stratagene) and GeneSpring GX 10 (Agilent) with default settings. The CEL files were imported, and the triplicates from the same siRNA treatment were assigned into the same group. Probe sets at the core level were summarized by using the ExonPLIER algorithm. Quantile normalization was performed, and antigenomic probes were used as background probes. For variance stabilization, the number of 16 was added to probe set intensity values before transformation to a log2 scale. Once the summarized dataset was obtained, a series of analysis were applied to assess the quality of the samples, hybridization procedures, and actual data. In brief, the poly(A) controls view was used to monitor the target labeling process. The hybridization controls view depicts the hybridization quality. The principal component analysis allows viewing of separations between groups of replicates. The correlation coefficient for each pair of arrays was calculated for all of the samples. Through these analyses, one of the siNELF-B samples was found to be an outlier, and data from the three arrays of the siNELF-B group were therefore excluded from subsequent analyses. Probe sets below the noise level were filtered out by the detection above background analysis. A transcript was retained if one of its probe sets had p value of <0.05 in at least six of the remaining 12 arrays. Gene level expression was estimated with the same algorithm from all of the probe sets in each transcript. A splicing index was then calculated for all of the probe sets using siControl samples as the reference group. Pairwise analysis was conducted to compare all groups with the siControl reference group using unpaired t test. Transcripts that were commonly changed in siNELF-A, -C, and -E groups with a fold change of >1.5 and a p value of <0.05 were selected as the differentially expressed genes, and probe sets with an absolute value of differential splicing index of >1 and a p value of <0.05 were selected as the alternatively spliced probe sets. The list of probe sets with significant splicing index was further filtered to retain those with at least two nonoverlapping probes and unique hybridization pattern. Hierarchical clustering analysis on differentially expressed genes was performed with GeneSpring GX. Gene ontology analysis was performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources and confirmed with ArrayAssist and GeneSpring GX. Cell proliferation of the control and NELF knockdown cells was measured by cell counting with a hemocytometer. Briefly, the same number of T47D cells was plated for siRNA transfection, and triplicate samples were prepared for each condition. Cell number was counted on the second, third, and fourth day after siRNA transfection, and data were presented as the averages of the triplicate samples ± standard deviation. For FACS analysis, the cells were collected at the fourth day after siRNA transfection, fixed overnight with 90% ethanol at 4 °C, and stained with 50 μg/ml of propidium iodide at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed with FACS. For bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) analysis, asynchronously growing cells 3 days after siRNA transfection were pulse-labeled with 50 μm BrdUrd for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and replenished with growth medium for various periods of time. Cells were trypsinized, collected in growth medium, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellet was then washed once with PBS-SN (PBS with 1% fetal bovine serum and 1% NaN3) and fixed overnight with 90% ice-cold ethanol at 4 °C. The fixed cells were washed again with PBS-SN, denatured with 2 m HCl by incubation at room temperature for 20 min, and neutralized with 0.1 m boric acid, pH 8.5, for 5 min. After wash with PBS-TB (PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.05% bovine serum albumin), the cells were resuspended in 200 μl of BrdUrd staining buffer (PBS with 0.5% Tween 20, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and a 1:100 dilution of an anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen; A21303) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS-TB, stained with propidium iodide for 30 min, and analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). ChIP protocol was adapted from published work (26.Ding N. Zhou H. Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) with several modifications. The cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by termination with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. The cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with lysis buffer I (5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended and incubated in lysis buffer II (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF) for 10 min on ice. The cells were then sonicated with Bioruptor (Diagenode sa, Belgium), and insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Chromatin extract was diluted by 10-fold with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg/ml sonicated single-strand DNA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF) and precleared with a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose preblocked with sonicated single-strand DNA. Extract from ∼2 × 106 cells was used for each immunoprecipitation reaction by incubating with 2 μg of antibody at 4 °C overnight. 5% of input extract was saved prior to immunoprecipitation as input control for normalization. Immune complexes were captured with preblocked protein A-agarose for rabbit polyclonal antibodies or protein G-agarose for monoclonal antibodies for 2 h. Precipitated protein-DNA complexes were washed, and DNA was eluted, reverse cross-linked, and purified as previously described (26.Ding N. Zhou H. Esteve P.O. Chin H.G. Kim S. Xu X. Joseph S.M. Friez M.J. Schwartz C.E. Pradhan S. Boyer T.G. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DNA from the input samples was recovered with a MinElute reaction clean-up kit (Qiagen) after reverse cross-linking at 65 °C overnight. Input and immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by real time PCR. 160 of the precipitated DNA or 1120 of the input DNA was used in each PCR. To assess the impact of acute NELF depletion on global gene expression, human T47D cells were transfected with minimal amounts of siRNA duplex that were required for efficient and rapid knockdown of individual NELF subunits. As shown in Fig. 1A, the NELF-specific siRNA duplexes readily reduced the protein levels of the corresponding targets. Consistent with published finding of co-dependence of protein stability among the NELF subunits (23.Narita T. Yung T.M. Yamamoto J. Tsuboi Y. Tanabe H. Tanaka K. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 349-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25.Sun J. Watkins G. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C. Ghosh S. Jiang W.G. Li R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2008; 103: 1798-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), knockdown of one NELF subunit also reduced the protein (Fig. 1A) but not the mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. S1) of the other three NELF subunits. Among all four knockdowns, the NELF-E siRNA duplex was most effective in co-depleting the entire NELF complex (Fig. 1A). Using mRNA from the control and individual NELF knockdown cells, we carried out a gene expression profiling analysis with the exon array from Affymetrix. The exon array assesses the abundance of all exons from both empirically curated mRNA sequences and computationally predicted transcripts. In addition to gene level changes, the exon array can also reveal variations in individual exons that may result from alternative splicing, promoter utilization, termination, and polyadenylation (27.Gardina P.J.

Cell. 2008; 133: 585-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Principle component analysis indicates that the data points for NELF-A, -C, and -E knockdown cells were all clustered with each other and well separated from those of the control knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. S2). However, the three data points from NELF-B knockdown cells were scattered on the plot (supplemental Fig. S2) and yielded low correlation coefficient (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting poor reproducibility among the triplicates. Curiously, none of the three data points for NELF-B knockdown cells were in close proximity to any of the other NELF knockdown samples in the principle component analysis plot (supplemental Fig. S2). Although the biological significance of this NELF-B-specific phenomenon remains unclear and is subject to future investigation, we choose to focus on the common gene expression profiles shared by NELF-A, -C, and -E knockdown cells in the current study. A total of 543 genes were differentially expressed at the gene level by at least 1.5-fold with a p value of <0.05 between the control and all three NELF knockdown cell populations (supplemental Table S2). A visual inspection of the hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of genes with regard to the effects of NELF knockdown (Fig. 1B). Group a consisted of genes that were commonly down-regulated by knockdown of different NELF subunits. The vast majority of NELF-affected genes fell into this category. Of note, ∼28% of the genes in this group were down-regulated more than 3-fold by NELF-E knockdown, as compared with 8% that were affected to the same extent by NELF-A or -C knockdown. This correlated with the more complete depletion of the NELF complex by the NELF-E siRNA oligonucleotides. Group b contained genes whose expression was increased in all NELF-depleted samples. This included JUNB, an immediate early response gene that was previously shown to be negatively regulated by NELF (14.Aida M. Chen Y. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6094-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Unlike the first two groups, genes in group c were affected in opposite directions by knockdown of different NELF subunits. This could be due to possible actions of individual NELF subunits that were independent of the NELF complex. Alternatively, it might result from potential off-target effects of siRNA oligonucleotides. Taken together, the gene expression profiling analysis suggests that the human NELF complex predominantly functions to sustain active expression of its target genes. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that the NELF-regulated genes were significantly enriched with those involved in various aspects of cell cycle progression (Fig. 1C). These gene products, which are all reduced by NELF knockdown (group a), are important for DNA replication (e.g. CDT1, MCM5, POLA1, TK1, and TOP2A), DNA recombination (e.g. RECQL and SMC6), DNA packaging (e.g. histone genes), spindle organization and biogenesis (e.g. AURKA, NDC80, and UBE2C), mitotic chromosome condensation (e.g. CDCA5, POLS, and SMC2), and regulation of progression through cell cycle (e.g. CCND1, CCNE2, and MYBL2). The microarray results for representatives of these cell cycle genes were verified by RT-PCR, using mRNA samples from independent siRNA transfection experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, mRNA levels of CCNB2, TOP2A, DLG7, CCNE2, and MYBL2 were all reduced by NELF-A, -C, and -E knockdown. Consistent with published data (14.Aida M. Chen Y. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 6094-6104Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), JUNB expression was elevated in all three knockdown cell populations. When active transcription was blocked by actinomycin D, mRNA levels of the potential NELF target genes decreased with similar kinetics in control and NELF-E knockdown cells (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the changes in steady-state mRNA levels upon NELF depletion are more likely due to the impact of NELF on transcription rates than on mRNA half-lives. To determine whether the siNELF-affected genes were direct targets of NELF, we used ChIP to examine the occupancy of NELF-C at these gene loci. NELF-C was chosen for the ChIP analysis because of the high efficiency of the corresponding antibody in immunoprecipitation (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3A, the NELF-C signal peaked at the promoter-proximal region (position b) of both NELF-activated and -repressed genes tested. Low or no NELF-C signals were detected in regions between 300 and 500 bp upstream (position a) or 1.5–2 kb downstream (position c) of the transcription initiation sites (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the NELF-C signals at promoter-proximal regions were significantly dampened in the NELF-C knockdown cells (Fig. 3B), demonstrating the specificity of the ChIP signals. These data indicate that the cell cycle-related genes identified by the exon array are most likely direct targets of NELF. The positive effect of human NELF on transcription of a large number of cell cycle-related genes is apparently distinct from its well documented activity in inhibition of transcription elongation. To elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of a positive role of NELF in transcriptional regulation, we first examined distribution of RNAPII at the NELF target genes in control and NELF-E knockdown cells. Using an antibody that recognizes the N terminus of the largest subunit of RNAPII, we found by ChIP that the total RNAPII levels were enriched at the promoter-proximal regions of these genes in the control cells (compare positions a and b in Fig. 4A). Consistent with its effect on gene expression, NELF depletion significantly reduced the total RNAPII levels at the 5′ end of the NELF-activated genes (CCNB2, CCNE2, D"

Many molecules implicated in migratory polarity show uniform cellular distribution under non-activated conditions, but acquire a polarized localization upon exposure to migratory cues.Here, we present evidence that raft-associated endocytic proteins (flotillins) are pre-assembled in lymphoid, myeloid and primitive hematopoietic cells and accumulate in the uropod during migration. Furthermore, flotillins display a polarized distribution during immunological synapse formation. Employing the membrane lipid-order sensitive probe Laurdan, we show that flotillin accumulation in the immunological synapse is concomittant with membrane ordering in these regions.Together with the observation that flotillin polarization does not occur in other polarized cell types such as polarized epithelial cells, our results suggest a specific role for flotillins in hematopoietic cell polarization. Based on our results, we propose that in hematopoietic cells, flotillins provide intrinsic cues that govern segregation of certain microdomain-associated molecules during immune cell polarization."
https://openalex.org/W2128930513,"Background Legumes are unique in their ability to establish symbiotic interaction with rhizobacteria from Rhizobium genus, which provide them with available nitrogen. Nodulation factors (NFs) produced by Rhizobium initiate legume root hair deformation and curling that entrap the bacteria, and allow it to grow inside the plant. In contrast, legumes and non-legumes activate defense responses when inoculated with pathogenic bacteria. One major defense pathway is mediated by salicylic acid (SA). SA is sensed and transduced to downstream defense components by a redox-regulated protein called NPR1. Methodology/Principal Findings We used Arabidopsis mutants in SA defense pathway to test the role of NPR1 in symbiotic interactions. Inoculation of Sinorhizobium meliloti or purified NF on Medicago truncatula or nim1/npr1 A. thaliana mutants induced root hair deformation and transcription of early and late nodulins. Application of S. meliloti or NF on M. truncatula or A. thaliana roots also induced a strong oxidative burst that lasted much longer than in plants inoculated with pathogenic or mutualistic bacteria. Transient overexpression of NPR1 in M. truncatula suppressed root hair curling, while inhibition of NPR1 expression by RNAi accelerated curling. Conclusions/Significance We show that, while NPR1 has a positive effect on pathogen resistance, it has a negative effect on symbiotic interactions, by inhibiting root hair deformation and nodulin expression. Our results also show that basic plant responses to Rhizobium inoculation are conserved in legumes and non-legumes."
https://openalex.org/W1968429103,"The Notch signaling pathway is a cell-cell communication network giving rise to cell differentiation during metazoan development. Activation of the pathway releases the intracellular portion of the Notch receptor to translocate to the nucleus, where it is able to interact with the effector transcription factor CSL, converting CSL from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. This conversion is dependent upon the high affinity binding of the RAM region of the Notch receptor to the β-trefoil domain (BTD) of CSL. Here we probe the energetics of binding to BTD of each conserved residue of RAM through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry and single residue substitution. We find that although the highly conserved ΦWΦP motif is the largest determinant of binding, energetically significant interactions are contributed by N-terminal residues, including a conserved Arg/Lys-rich region. Additionally, we present a thermodynamic analysis of the interaction between the Epstein-Barr virus protein EBNA2 with BTD and explore the extent to which the EBNA2- and RAM-binding sites on BTD are nonoverlapping, as proposed by Fuchs et al.

https://openalex.org/W2021551988,"Background Expression of the minor virion structural protein VP2 of the calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV) is believed to occur by the unusual mechanism of termination codon-dependent reinitiation of translation. In this process, following translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) and termination at the stop codon, a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF, which is typically in close proximity. Consistent with this, the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF (UAA) in the pentanucleotide UAAUG. Principal Findings Here, we confirm that MNV VP2 expression is regulated by termination-reinitiation and define the mRNA sequence requirements. Efficient reintiation is dependent upon 43 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAAUG site. Chemical and enzymatic probing revealed that the RNA in this region is not highly structured and includes an essential stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 (Motif 1). The relative position of Motif 1 with respect to the UAAUG site impacts upon the efficiency of the process. Termination-reinitiation in MNV was also found to be relatively insensitive to the initiation inhibitor edeine. Conclusions The termination-reinitiation signal of MNV most closely resembles that of influenza BM2. Similar to other viruses that use this strategy, base-pairing between mRNA and rRNA is likely to play a role in tethering the 40S subunit to the mRNA following termination at the VP1 stop codon. Our data also indicate that accurate recognition of the VP2 ORF AUG is not a pre-requisite for efficient reinitiation of translation in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2165360517,"The interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-lra) is an important negative regulator of the inflammatory response, whose genetic deficiency has been recently shown to cause a severe autoinflammatory syndrome in humans. In this study we characterized the molecular mechanisms whereby interleukin 10 (IL-10) potentiates IL-1ra transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes and neutrophils. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that although NF-κBp65 and NF-κBp50 proteins accumulate into the nuclei and bind to the IKBα promoter during LPS stimulation, they are not recruited to the κB sites of the IL-1ra promoter. However, in response to LPS plus IL-10, which were found to induce chromatin acetylation, recruitment of both NF-κBp65 and NF-κBp50 to the IL-1ra promoter efficiently occurs in a STAT3-dependent manner. Accordingly, in neutrophils from hyper-IgE syndrome patients, who carry a nonfunctional STAT3, IL-10 failed to promote NF-κBp65 recruitment to the IL-1ra promoter and consequently to potentiate LPS-induced IL-1ra transcription. Altogether our findings uncover a novel mechanism whereby IL-10-activated STAT3 modulates IL-1ra transcription in LPS-treated phagocytes by making IL-1ra promoter accessible to readily available nuclear NF-KB.—Tamassia, N., Castellucci, M., Rossato, M., Gasperini, S., Bosisio, D., Giacomelli, M., Badolato, R., Cassatella, M.

https://openalex.org/W2062033938,"Background Thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) is a multifunctional protein involved in regulation of cell cycle events and cellular metabolism. The expression of Txnip is known to be induced by glucose, adenosine-containing molecules, and other physiological cues; however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, using promoter reporter, electrophoresis mobility shift (EMSA), and chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assays, we have identified an additional carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) on the promoter of Txnip gene, which functions cooperatively with the earlier identified ChoRE to mediate optimal Txnip expression. However, these two ChoREs are not sufficient to mediate the induction of Txnip expression by glucose or adenosine-containing molecules; and two CCAAT boxes, both of which can recruit nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) to the Txnip promoter, are also required for the induction. Accordingly, we have found that the function of ChoREs and associated factors is contingent on tandem CCAAT boxes, in that occupancy of the Txnip promoter by NF-Y is a prerequisite for efficacious recruitment of Mondo/MLX to ChoREs under glucose stimulation. Conclusions/Significance Our findings suggest a synergy between the tandem CCAAT and ChoRE motifs and associated NF-Y and Mondo/MLX transcription factors in enhancing transcription from the Txnip promoter. This piece of information will be helpful for future dissection of molecular mechanisms governing the transcriptional regulation of Txnip, a glucose responsive gene."
https://openalex.org/W2073835606,"Background The type-1 cytokine pathway plays a pivotal role in immunity against intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Salmonellae and Mycobacteria. Bacterial stimulation of pattern recognition receptors on monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells initiates this pathway, and results in the production of cytokines that activate lymphocytes to produce interferon (IFN)-γ. Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 are thought to be the key cytokines required for initiating a type-1 cytokine immune response to Mycobacteria and Salmonellae. The relative contribution of IL-23 and IL-12 to this process is uncertain. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that various TLR agonists induce the production of IL-23 but not IL-12 in freshly isolated human monocytes and cultured human macrophages. In addition, type 1 pro-inflammatory macrophages (Mφ1) differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF and infected with live Salmonella produce IL-23, IL-1β and IL-18, but not IL-12. Supernatants of Salmonella-infected Mφ1 contained more IL-18 and IL-1β as compared with supernatants of Mφ1 stimulated with isolated TLR agonists, and induced IFN-γ production in human CD56+ cells in an IL-23 and IL-1β-dependent but IL-12-independent manner. In addition, IL-23 together with IL-18 or IL-1β led to the production of GM-CSF in CD56+ cells. Both IFN-γ and GM-CSF enhanced IL-23 production by monocytes in response to TLR agonists, as well as induced IL-12 production. Conclusions/Significance The findings implicate a positive feedback loop in which IL-23 can enhance its release via induction of IFN-γ and GM-CSF. The IL-23 induced cytokines allow for the subsequent production of IL-12 and amplify the IFN-γ production in the type-1 cytokine pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2088440440,"Clusterin (CLU) is a ubiquitous protein that has been implicated in tumorigenesis, apoptosis, inflammation, and cell proliferation. We and others have previously shown that CLU is an inhibitor of the NF-kappaB pathway. However, the exact form of CLU and the region(s) of CLU involved in this effect were unknown. Using newly generated molecular constructs encoding for CLU and various regions of the molecule, we demonstrated that the presecretory form of CLU (psCLU) form bears the NF-kappaB regulatory activity. Sequence comparison analysis showed sequence motif identity between CLU and beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), a main E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IkappaB-alpha degradation. These homologies were localized in the disulfide constraint region of CLU. We generated a specific molecular construct of this region, named DeltaCLU, and showed that it has the same NF-kappaB regulatory activity as CLU. Neither the alpha-chain nor the beta-chain of CLU had any NF-kappaB regulatory activity. Furthermore, we showed that following tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation of transfected cells, we could co-immunoprecipitate phospho-IkappaB-alpha with DeltaCLU. Moreover, we showed that DeltaCLU could localize both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. These results demonstrate the identification of a new CLU activity site involved in NF-kappaB pathway regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2061826097,"Fine-tuning of the Wnt/TCF pathway is crucial for multiple embryological processes, including liver development. Here we describe how the interaction between Hhex (hematopoietically expressed homeobox) and SOX13 (SRY-related high mobility group box transcription factor 13), modulates Wnt/TCF pathway activity. Hhex is a homeodomain factor expressed in multiple endoderm-derived tissues, like the liver, where it is essential for proper development. The pleiotropic expression of Hhex during embryonic development and its dual role as a transcriptional repressor and activator suggest the presence of different tissue-specific partners capable of modulating its activity and function. While searching for developmentally regulated Hhex partners, we set up a yeast two-hybrid screening using an E9.5-10.5 mouse embryo library and the N-terminal domain of Hhex as bait. Among the putative protein interactors, we selected SOX13 for further characterization. We found that SOX13 interacts directly with full-length Hhex, and we delineated the interaction domains within the two proteins. SOX13 is known to repress Wnt/TCF signaling by interacting with TCF1. We show that Hhex is able to block the SOX13-dependent repression of Wnt/TCF activity by displacing SOX13 from the SOX13 x TCF1 complex. Moreover, Hhex de-repressed the Wnt/TCF pathway in the ventral foregut endoderm of cultured mouse embryos electroporated with a SOX13-expressing plasmid. We conclude that the interaction between Hhex and SOX13 may contribute to control Wnt/TCF signaling in the early embryo."

While the clinical features have been characterized, the molecular mechanisms of functioning of these two mutants remain elusive. In the present study, we compare the pharmacological properties of R137C and R137L mutants with the wild-type and the V2 D136A receptor, the latter being reported as a highly constitutively active receptor. We have performed binding studies, second messenger measurements and BRET experiments in order to evaluate the affinities of the ligands, their agonist and antagonist properties and the ability of the receptors to recruit beta-arrestins, respectively. The R137C and R137L receptors exhibit small constitutive activities regarding the G(s) protein activation. In addition, these two mutants induce a constitutive beta-arrestin recruitment. Of interest, they also exhibit weak sensitivities to agonist and to inverse agonist in term of G(s) protein coupling and beta-arrestin recruitment. The small constitutive activities of the mutants and the weak regulation of their functioning by agonist suggest a poor ability of the antidiuretic function to be adapted to the external stimuli, giving to the environmental factors an importance which can explain some of the phenotypic variability in patients having NSIAD."

https://openalex.org/W1993117408,"Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma (CaP) are linked to aging and the presence of androgens, suggesting that androgen regulated genes play a major role in these common diseases. Androgen regulation of prostate growth and development depends on the presence of intact epithelial-stromal interactions. Further, the prostatic stroma is implicated in BPH. This suggests that epithelial cell lines are inadequate to identify androgen regulated genes that could contribute to BPH and CaP and which could serve as potential clinical biomarkers. In this study, we used a human prostate xenograft model to define a profile of genes regulated in vivo by androgens, with an emphasis on identifying candidate biomarkers. Benign transition zone (TZ) human prostate tissue from radical prostatectomies was grafted to the sub-renal capsule site of intact or castrated male immunodeficient mice, followed by the removal or addition of androgens, respectively. Microarray analysis of RNA from these tissues was used to identify genes that were; 1) highly expressed in prostate, 2) had significant expression changes in response to androgens, and, 3) encode extracellular proteins. A total of 95 genes meeting these criteria were selected for analysis and validation of expression in patient prostate tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression levels of these genes were measured in pooled RNAs from human prostate tissues with varying severity of BPH pathologic changes and CaP of varying Gleason score. A number of androgen regulated genes were identified. Additionally, a subset of these genes were over-expressed in RNA from clinical BPH tissues, and the levels of many were found to correlate with disease status. Our results demonstrate the feasibility, and some of the problems, of using a mouse xenograft model to characterize the androgen regulated expression profiles of intact human prostate tissues."

In this study we showed that, in contrast to C57BL/6 Rag2−/−/γc−/− and NOD/Scid mice, newborn BALB/c Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice can support the development of human NK cells and CD56+ T cells after intrahepatic injection with hematopoietic stem cells. The human CD56+ cells in BALB/c Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice were able to produce IFN-γ in response to human IL-15 and polyI:C. NK cells from reconstituted Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice were also able to kill and inhibit the growth of K562 cells in vitro and were able to produce IFN-γ in response to stimulation with K562 cells. In vivo, reconstituted Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice had higher survival rates after K562 challenge compared to non-reconstituted Rag2−/−/γc−/− mice and were able to control tumor burden in various organs.

https://openalex.org/W2041723357,"Newly emerging multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) severely limit the treatment options for tuberculosis (TB); hence, new antitubercular drugs are urgently needed. The mymA operon is essential for the virulence and intracellular survival of M.tb and thus represents an attractive target for the development of new antitubercular drugs. This study is focused on the structure-function relationship of Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase (FadD13, Rv3089) belonging to the mymA operon. Eight site-directed mutants of FadD13 were designed, constructed and analyzed for the structural-functional integrity of the enzyme. The study revealed that mutation of Lys(487) resulted in approximately 95% loss of the activity thus demonstrating its crucial requirement for the enzymatic activity. Comparison of the kinetic parameters showed the residues Lys(172) and Ala(302) to be involved in the binding of ATP and Ser(404) in the binding of CoenzymeA. The influence of mutations of the residues Val(209) and Trp(377) emphasized their importance in maintaining the structural integrity of FadD13. Besides, we show a synergistic influence of fatty acid and ATP binding on the conformation and rigidity of FadD13. FadD13 represents the first Fatty Acyl-CoA Synthetase to display biphasic kinetics for fatty acids. FadD13 exhibits a distinct preference for C(26)/C(24) fatty acids, which in the light of earlier reported observations further substantiates the role of the mymA operon in remodeling the cell envelope of intracellular M.tb under acidic conditions. A three-dimensional model of FadD13 was generated; the docking of ATP to the active site verified its interaction with Lys(172), Ala(302) and Lys(487) and corresponded well with the results of the mutational studies. Our study provides a significant understanding of the FadD13 protein including the identification of residues important for its activity as well as in the maintenance of structural integrity. We believe that the findings of this study will provide valuable inputs in the development of inhibitors against the mymA operon, an important target for the development of antitubercular drugs."

Despite the importance of Tal1 in erythropoiesis, only a small number of erythroid differentiation target genes are known. A chromatin precipitation and cloning approach was established to uncover novel Tal1 target genes in erythropoiesis. The BirA tag/BirA ligase biotinylation system in combination with streptavidin chromatin precipitation (Strep-CP) was used to co-precipitate genomic DNA bound to Tal1. Tal1 was found to bind in the vicinity of 31 genes including the E2-ubiquitin conjugase UBE2H gene. Binding of Tal1 to UBE2H was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. UBE2H expression is increased during erythroid differentiation of hCD34(+) cells. Tal1 expression activated UBE2H expression, whereas Tal1 knock-down reduced UBE2H expression and ubiquitin transfer activity. This study identifies parts of the ubiquitinylation machinery as a cellular target downstream of the transcription factor Tal1 and provides novel insights into Tal1-regulated erythropoiesis."

Multiple Ran isoform genes are located in different genomic loci in mice (10.Drivas G. Massey R. Chang H.Y. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An actively transcribed isoform, Ran/M2, is coded by a gene in chromosome 7 (GenBank accession number: NM_009028); Ran and Ran/M2 share 94.6% identity in the nucleotide coding sequence and 94.0% identity and 98.1% similarity (allowing amino acid substitution) in their peptide sequences (11.Coutavas E.E.

It is likely that multiple isoforms are the result of gene duplication during evolution. Ran is expressed in various tissues, whereas Ran/M2 has restricted expression in the testis according to real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis (11.Coutavas E.E. Hsieh C.M. Ren M.

For example, COS cells transfected with Ran can costimulate mouse CD8 but not CD4 cells; RMA lymphoma cells transfected with Ran become less tumorigenic in vivo (12.Nieland J.D. Haks M.C.

Consistent with the role of Ran in protein importation into nuclei, IFN-γ-dependent STAT-1 translocation to nuclei depends on Ran and its GTPase activity (13.Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T.

We generated transgenic mice overexpressing Ran using an actin promoter. Ran transgenic (Tg) T cells presented compromised functions and reduced c-Jun and c-Fos nuclear import upon activation. Our results suggest that the Ran expression level controls the nuclear presence of selective transcription factors, which in turn modulate T cell immune responses.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we undertook the first comprehensive mapping of Ran expression during mouse ontogeny. The ubiquitous Ran expression in the early gestation stages suggests critical roles of Ran in embryonic development. Ran is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. It is, therefore, not surprising to find its high expression in cells or regions of organs that have vigorous proliferation capability, such as the thymus cortex (Fig. 1), the gastric epithelium, the germinal centers of the hair follicles, and spermatogonia (data not shown). However, certain tissues, such as the cerebral cortex, the olfactory neuroepithelium, the trigeminal ganglion, and the dorsal root ganglion, do not contain fast growing cells, yet they have high levels of Ran transcripts, indicating that the function of Ran is not restricted to proliferation.High Ran mRNA expression of in the thymus and spleen prompted us to conduct an in-depth investigation on its role in T cells. We found that the activation marker expression, lymphokine production, and proliferation after TCR ligation or TCR plus anti-CD28 ligation were compromised in vitro in Ran Tg T cells. We also found that when compared with WT mice, Ran Tg mice presented dampened in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, which is a T cell-mediated process. On the other hand, the proliferation of Ran Tg B cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was not significantly different from that of WT B cells (data not shown); Tg and WT mice had comparable levels of different serum Ig isotypes (data now shown), probably a reflection of lower Tg Ran overexpression in B cells (data not shown).During T cell activation, transcription factors need to be accumulated to certain high levels in the nuclei to initiate the activation program. We selected a group of well studied transcription factors, i.e. AP-1 proteins and NF-κB members, to assess the effect of Ran on their nuclear levels, which depend on dynamic equilibrium between their nuclear import, degradation, and in some cases, their export from the nuclei (17.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For all these proteins examined, Ran overexpression did not affect their cytoplasmic levels, suggesting that their synthesis and degradation in the cytosol are not influenced by Ran overexpression. However, certain (e.g. AP-1), but not all, transcription factor levels in the nuclei were affected by Ran overexpression. AP-1 is composed of c-Jun and c-Fos heterodimers and is essential in the TCR signaling pathway, lymphokine production, and lymphokine receptor signaling (18.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 19.Lederer J.A. Liou J.S. Todd M.D. Glimcher L.H. Lichtman A.H. J.

Burgess S.J. Pathmanathan I. Borrego F. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Its nuclear level in Ran-overexpressing Tg T cells shortly after T cell activation (within 1 h) failed to increase to a level comparable with that of WT T cells. c-Jun and c-Fos nuclear import depends on several importins and transportins (22.Waldmann I. Wälde S. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27685-27692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23.Arnold M Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Undimerized c-Fos can also be shuttled back to cytosol from the nuclei independent of Crm-1 exportin (17.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ran has been well documented for its role in protein nuclear import (9.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that Ran overexpression interferes with proper c-Jun and c-Fos import, and this contributes to compromised AP-1 retention in the nuclei. Whether Ran overexpression also causes increased c-Fos and c-Jun export leading to lower AP-1 accumulation in the nuclei remains an open question.We propose the following model for the function of Ran in T cells related to AP-1 nuclear accumulation. In resting WT T cells at the peri-activation stage, there is a low Ran level, which facilitates AP-1 nuclear accumulation in the nuclei and allows AP-1 to perform its function in the nuclei in the early stage of the T cell activation program. Ran expression is up-regulated 24–48 h after TCR activation. At that time, most needs for AP-1 have been fulfilled; the Ran up-regulation at that time serves to reduce AP-1 nuclear levels, with a purpose to terminate the T cell activation program. Following the peak AP-1 accumulation at 48 h, T cell cytokine production and proliferation all start to decline. In Tg T cells, the forced Ran overexpression in resting T cells prevented the increase of AP-1 nuclear levels at the beginning of the activation program, and as a consequence, T cell lymphokine secretion, proliferation, and in vivo function were compromised.Another interesting discovery is that although Ran is known to be essential in nuclear protein accumulation, it does not seem to act in that capacity universally for all proteins. The mechanism of such differential regulation certainly is worth further investigation. On the other hand, we would also like to mention that AP-1 members are probably not the only transcription factors whose nuclear import is regulated by Ran. We did not conduct an exhaustive survey of all the transcription factors involved in T cell activation, but we noticed that there was a moderately dampened increase of NFAT (Fig. 7D) and STAT-4 (data not shown) levels in nuclei of T cells after TCR activation. Obviously, as Ran regulates multiple important cellular functions as summarized in the Introduction, what we identified here in terms of compromised AP-1 nuclear retention is probably but one of the multifaceted impacts of Ran on T cell activation.

Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). It is a rather abundant 25-kDa protein, about 80% of which is located in the nucleus (2.Ren M. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Ran is a highly conserved gene from yeast to mammals (1.Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G.

Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and the complex performs critical functions in many cellular events, such as DNA replication (5.Matsumoto T. Beach D. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In the mouse genome, Ran resides in chromosome 5 (GenBank™ accession number NM_009391). Multiple Ran isoform genes are located in different genomic loci in mice (10.Drivas G. Massey R. Chang H.Y. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Mamm. Genome. 1991; 1: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An actively transcribed isoform, Ran/M2, is coded by a gene in chromosome 7 (GenBank accession number: NM_009028); Ran and Ran/M2 share 94.6% identity in the nucleotide coding sequence and 94.0% identity and 98.1% similarity (allowing amino acid substitution) in their peptide sequences (11.Coutavas E.E. Hsieh C.M. Ren M. Drivas G.T. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P.D. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is likely that multiple isoforms are the result of gene duplication during evolution. Ran is expressed in various tissues, whereas Ran/M2 has restricted expression in the testis according to real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis (11.Coutavas E.E. Hsieh C.M. Ren M. Drivas G.T. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P.D. Mamm.

For example, COS cells transfected with Ran can costimulate mouse CD8 but not CD4 cells; RMA lymphoma cells transfected with Ran become less tumorigenic in vivo (12.Nieland J.D. Haks M.C. Kremers B.L. Leupers T.J. Bakker A.Q. Offringa R. Kruisbeek A.M. Cancer Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 259-273PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of Ran in protein importation into nuclei, IFN-γ-dependent STAT-1 translocation to nuclei depends on Ran and its GTPase activity (13.Sekimoto T. Nakajima K. Tachibana T.

We generated transgenic mice overexpressing Ran using an actin promoter. Ran transgenic (Tg) T cells presented compromised functions and reduced c-Jun and c-Fos nuclear import upon activation. Our results suggest that the Ran expression level controls the nuclear presence of selective transcription factors, which in turn modulate T cell immune responses.

Our results suggest that the Ran expression level controls the nuclear presence of selective transcription factors, which in turn modulate T cell immune responses. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we undertook the first comprehensive mapping of Ran expression during mouse ontogeny. The ubiquitous Ran expression in the early gestation stages suggests critical roles of Ran in embryonic development. Ran is involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression. It is, therefore, not surprising to find its high expression in cells or regions of organs that have vigorous proliferation capability, such as the thymus cortex (Fig. 1), the gastric epithelium, the germinal centers of the hair follicles, and spermatogonia (data not shown). However, certain tissues, such as the cerebral cortex, the olfactory neuroepithelium, the trigeminal ganglion, and the dorsal root ganglion, do not contain fast growing cells, yet they have high levels of Ran transcripts, indicating that the function of Ran is not restricted to proliferation.High Ran mRNA expression of in the thymus and spleen prompted us to conduct an in-depth investigation on its role in T cells. We found that the activation marker expression, lymphokine production, and proliferation after TCR ligation or TCR plus anti-CD28 ligation were compromised in vitro in Ran Tg T cells. We also found that when compared with WT mice, Ran Tg mice presented dampened in vivo delayed type hypersensitivity reaction, which is a T cell-mediated process. On the other hand, the proliferation of Ran Tg B cells stimulated by lipopolysaccharide was not significantly different from that of WT B cells (data not shown); Tg and WT mice had comparable levels of different serum Ig isotypes (data now shown), probably a reflection of lower Tg Ran overexpression in B cells (data not shown).During T cell activation, transcription factors need to be accumulated to certain high levels in the nuclei to initiate the activation program. We selected a group of well studied transcription factors, i.e. AP-1 proteins and NF-κB members, to assess the effect of Ran on their nuclear levels, which depend on dynamic equilibrium between their nuclear import, degradation, and in some cases, their export from the nuclei (17.Malnou C.E.

For all these proteins examined, Ran overexpression did not affect their cytoplasmic levels, suggesting that their synthesis and degradation in the cytosol are not influenced by Ran overexpression. However, certain (e.g. AP-1), but not all, transcription factor levels in the nuclei were affected by Ran overexpression. AP-1 is composed of c-Jun and c-Fos heterodimers and is essential in the TCR signaling pathway, lymphokine production, and lymphokine receptor signaling (18.Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z.

Its nuclear level in Ran-overexpressing Tg T cells shortly after T cell activation (within 1 h) failed to increase to a level comparable with that of WT T cells. c-Jun and c-Fos nuclear import depends on several importins and transportins (22.Waldmann I. Wälde S. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27685-27692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23.Arnold M Nath A. Wohlwend D. Kehlenbach R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5492-5499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Undimerized c-Fos can also be shuttled back to cytosol from the nuclei independent of Crm-1 exportin (17.Malnou C.E. Salem T. Brockly F. Wodrich H. Piechaczyk M. Jariel-Encontre I. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31046-31059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ran has been well documented for its role in protein nuclear import (9.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that Ran overexpression interferes with proper c-Jun and c-Fos import, and this contributes to compromised AP-1 retention in the nuclei. Whether Ran overexpression also causes increased c-Fos and c-Jun export leading to lower AP-1 accumulation in the nuclei remains an open question.We propose the following model for the function of Ran in T cells related to AP-1 nuclear accumulation. In resting WT T cells at the peri-activation stage, there is a low Ran level, which facilitates AP-1 nuclear accumulation in the nuclei and allows AP-1 to perform its function in the nuclei in the early stage of the T cell activation program. Ran expression is up-regulated 24–48 h after TCR activation. At that time, most needs for AP-1 have been fulfilled; the Ran up-regulation at that time serves to reduce AP-1 nuclear levels, with a purpose to terminate the T cell activation program. Following the peak AP-1 accumulation at 48 h, T cell cytokine production and proliferation all start to decline. In Tg T cells, the forced Ran overexpression in resting T cells prevented the increase of AP-1 nuclear levels at the beginning of the activation program, and as a consequence, T cell lymphokine secretion, proliferation, and in vivo function were compromised.Another interesting discovery is that although Ran is known to be essential in nuclear protein accumulation, it does not seem to act in that capacity universally for all proteins. The mechanism of such differential regulation certainly is worth further investigation. On the other hand, we would also like to mention that AP-1 members are probably not the only transcription factors whose nuclear import is regulated by Ran. We did not conduct an exhaustive survey of all the transcription factors involved in T cell activation, but we noticed that there was a moderately dampened increase of NFAT (Fig. 7D) and STAT-4 (data not shown) levels in nuclei of T cells after TCR activation. Obviously, as Ran regulates multiple important cellular functions as summarized in the Introduction, what we identified here in terms of compromised AP-1 nuclear retention is probably but one of the multifaceted impacts of Ran on T cell activation.

https://openalex.org/W2051674520,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by a reciprocal chromosomal translocation (9;22) that generates the Bcr-Abl fusion gene. The Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway is constitutively activated in Bcr-Abl-transformed cells, and Ras activity enhances the oncogenic ability of Bcr-Abl. However, the mechanism by which Bcr-Abl activates the Ras pathway is not completely understood. Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) inhibits activation of MEK by Raf-1 and its downstream signal transduction, resulting in blocking the MAP kinase pathway. In the present study, we found that RKIP was depleted in CML cells. We investigated the interaction between RKIP and Bcr-Abl in CML cell lines and Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells from CML patients. The Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced the expression of RKIP and reduced the pERK1/2 status, resulting in inhibited proliferation of CML cells. Moreover, RKIP up-regulated cell cycle regulator FoxM1 expression, resulting in G(1) arrest via p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1) accumulation. In colony-forming unit granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte, colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage, and burst-forming unit erythroid, treatment with the Abl kinase inhibitors and depletion of Bcr-Abl induced RKIP and reduced FoxM1 expressions, and inhibited colony formation of Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells, whereas depletion of RKIP weakened the inhibition of colony formation activity by the Abl kinase inhibitors in Bcr-Abl(+) progenitor cells. Thus, Bcr-Abl represses the expression of RKIP, continuously activates pERK1/2, and suppresses FoxM1 expression, resulting in proliferation of CML cells."
https://openalex.org/W2171202247,"On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage.We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay.Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited."
https://openalex.org/W1992405865,"A typical plasmid replicon of Escherichia coli, such as ori γ of R6K, contains tandem iterons (iterated initiator protein binding sites), an AT-rich region that melts upon initiator-iteron interaction, two binding sites for the bacterial initiator protein DnaA, and a binding site for the DNA-bending protein IHF. R6K also contains two structurally atypical origins called α and β that are located on either side of γ and contain a single and a half-iteron, respectively. Individually, these sites do not bind to initiator protein π but access it by DNA looping-mediated interaction with the seven π-bound γ iterons. The π protein exists in 2 interconvertible forms: inert dimers and active monomers. Initiator dimers generally function as negative regulators of replication by promoting iteron pairing (“handcuffing”) between pairs of replicons that turn off both origins. Contrary to this existing paradigm, here we show that both the dimeric and the monomeric π are necessary for ori α-driven plasmid maintenance. Furthermore, efficient looping interaction between α and γ or between 2 γ iterons in vitro also required both forms of π. Why does α-γ iteron pairing promote α activation rather than repression? We show that a weak, transitory α-γ interaction at the iteron pairs was essential for α-driven plasmid maintenance. Swapping the α iteron with one of γ without changing the original sequence context that caused enhanced looping in vitro caused a significant inhibition of α-mediated plasmid maintenance. Therefore, the affinity of α iteron for π-bound γ and not the sequence context determined whether the origin was activated or repressed. A typical plasmid replicon of Escherichia coli, such as ori γ of R6K, contains tandem iterons (iterated initiator protein binding sites), an AT-rich region that melts upon initiator-iteron interaction, two binding sites for the bacterial initiator protein DnaA, and a binding site for the DNA-bending protein IHF. R6K also contains two structurally atypical origins called α and β that are located on either side of γ and contain a single and a half-iteron, respectively. Individually, these sites do not bind to initiator protein π but access it by DNA looping-mediated interaction with the seven π-bound γ iterons. The π protein exists in 2 interconvertible forms: inert dimers and active monomers. Initiator dimers generally function as negative regulators of replication by promoting iteron pairing (“handcuffing”) between pairs of replicons that turn off both origins. Contrary to this existing paradigm, here we show that both the dimeric and the monomeric π are necessary for ori α-driven plasmid maintenance. Furthermore, efficient looping interaction between α and γ or between 2 γ iterons in vitro also required both forms of π. Why does α-γ iteron pairing promote α activation rather than repression? We show that a weak, transitory α-γ interaction at the iteron pairs was essential for α-driven plasmid maintenance. Swapping the α iteron with one of γ without changing the original sequence context that caused enhanced looping in vitro caused a significant inhibition of α-mediated plasmid maintenance. Therefore, the affinity of α iteron for π-bound γ and not the sequence context determined whether the origin was activated or repressed. IntroductionInvestigations of bacterial plasmid replicons have been invaluable in revealing the mechanism of replication initiation, termination, and copy number control (1.Chattoraj D.K. Snyder K.M.

There are generally three types of replication initiation mechanism in plasmids: (i) control by an antisense repressor RNA that hybridizes to the primer RNA and negatively regulates initiation frequency and copy control, as in the case of Col E1(4.Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), (ii) binding of an initiator protein to short repeated DNA sequences called iterons located at an ori (5.Pal S.K.

Cell Sci. 1987; 7: 15-31Crossref Google Scholar) followed by replisome assembly by protein-protein interaction with the initiator protein, and (iii) a rolling circle mechanism in which the plasmid initiator is not only an ori-specific “nickase” but also functions as a site-specific topoisomerase (8.Khan S.A. Murray R.W. Koepsel R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The plasmid R6K has 3 origins of replication called α, γ, and β, and all three are functionally dependent upon the plasmid-encoded initiator protein called π (Refs. 9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Inuzuka N. Inuzuka M. Helinski D.R. J. Biol.

U.S.A. 1975; 72: 2905-2909Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, see Fig. 1). The π protein binds to γ but not to the α and β iterons; the latter requires the presence of ori γ sequence in cis for initiating replication and enabling plasmid maintenance (13.Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D. Cell. 1988; 52: 375-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14.Miron A. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 6438-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The replication origins α and β are located ∼3800 and ∼1200 bp away, respectively, from ori γ and at its opposite side (11.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 15.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 454-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that π-mediated DNA looping between the single iteron at α or the half-iteron at β with the γ iteron array appears to activate the two distantly located origins, respectively (9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13.Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D.

U.S.A. 1988; 85: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Models of activation of each of the three origins, that are mutually exclusive, and the postulated looped structures involved in the process are shown in Fig. 1.More recently, the replication initiation from ori γ has been reconstituted in vitro using 22 purified proteins and that has illuminated part of the initiation mechanism at ori γ (17.Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Further progress has been made by solving the crystal structure of the monomeric γ iteron complex (18.Swan M.K. Bastia D. Davies C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18481-18486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The π protein has a winged helix structure (see Fig. 2, A and B) with N-terminal and C-terminal DNA recognition helices. In the monomeric form of the protein called π cop (for high copy number), the C-terminal recognition helix contacts base pairs (bps) located in the 5′-half of the iteron DNA, in the major groove, whereas the N-terminal recognition helix contacts the 3′-half of the iteron (see Fig. 2B and Ref. 18.Swan M.K. Bastia D. Davies C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18481-18486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Chemical and enzymatic footprinting data are consistent with the structure (19.Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20.Kunnimalaiyaan S. Rakowski S.A. Filutowicz M. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4953-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In contrast, the dimeric form of the protein contacts the bp located only in the 5′-half of the iteron probably through the C-terminal recognition helix; no contacts are seen with those located in the 3′-half (19.Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The dimers also fully contact the operator sequence that consists of two inverted half-repeats corresponding to the 5′-halves of the iteron (Fig. 2B) (19.Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Results suggest that dimerization of π causes significant alterations in its structure that probably prevent the N-terminal recognition helix from contacting the iteron DNA.FIGURE 2Structure of the monomeric π iteron complex and the postulated configuration of the dimeric and monomeric π protein bound to iteron DNA.A, crystal structure of monomeric π-iteron complex showing the two DNA recognition α helices; the N terminus is blue-green and the C terminus is red-brown. The locations of the various mutations used in this work are shown, and the structure is a winged helix. B, models based on footprinting data and crystal structure showing the postulated binding of monomeric and dimeric π to the iterons and the binding of dimeric π to the inverted half-iterons present at the π operator sequence shown in Fig. 1A; note that the dimer is postulated to undergo a structural alteration that prevents the N-terminal recognition helix from binding to the 3′-half of a full iteron sequence. C, gel mobility shift experiments showing that the dimer binds to a labeled γ iteron, giving a major shift corresponding to the dimer and a minor one corresponding to the monomer. The monomeric πP106L F107S (called π cop) binds to the γ iteron probe and exclusively generates a band corresponding to a monomeric π iteron complex; note that π cop binds with higher affinity to the DNA than the wt π as revealed by the intensity of the unbound probe. D, gel filtration profiles of the dimeric wt π (upper panel) and π cop (lower panel)) with marker proteins, showing a majority of dimeric protein (with a lesser peak corresponding to the monomer). E, neither the wt π nor the π cop binds to the α iteron probe under conditions identical to that shown in C. F, gel mobility shift experiments showing that the R75A and D226A mutants fail to bind to DNA. In all gel mobility shift experiments, 20 fmol of labeled DNA were incubated with 0, 8, 16, 32, and 64 pmol of π (wt, cop, R75A, and D226A forms). G, ELISA showing the binding of DnaB to various forms of purified π; note that although the R75A and D226A mutant forms are completely defective in iteron binding, these are almost as effective as wt π in binding to DnaB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The dimeric form of wt π is inert in replication initiation but gets converted to active monomers by the action of the DnaJ-DnaK-GrpE chaperone system, in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction (21.Zzaman S. Reddy J.M. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50886-50894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Iteron binding, as shown in this work, also induces some of the mutant forms such as π cop to monomerize almost completely.Replication initiation at ori γ is greatly enhanced by the binding of the DNA-bending protein, the integration host factor (IHF), 2The abbreviations used are: IHFintegration host factorORFopen-reading framewtwild typeELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation assayPBSphosphate-buffered saline. to its cognate site that apparently promotes protein-protein interactions between DnaA and π by bending the intervening DNA between a dnaA box and the iterons (22.Filutowicz M. Appelt K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 3829-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23.Kelley W.L. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15924-15937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ori γ can replicate feebly in an ihfΔ host, and the resultant plasmid copy number in this situation is drastically reduced so that the host cells, harboring the plasmid marked by an ampicillin resistance (ampR) marker and containing the open reading frame (ORF) of wt π, do not form visible colonies on plates containing 40 μg/ml of ampicillin. However, inclusions of an α or a β ori sequence in cis in the proper sequence context with γ rescues the growth on antibiotic plates. This observation has been used as a tool to distinguish between initiation and plasmid maintenance by ori γ from that by ori α or β (e.g. see Refs. 9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24.Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 5078-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Although the π protein makes a positive contribution to initiation of replication by assembling a replisome at the ori γ by protein-protein interactions with host-encoded replisomal proteins (25.Ratnakar P.V. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), it also negatively controls replication in two ways: (i) it binds to an inverted half-iteron sequence at its operator (19.Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) and represses its own synthesis at the transcriptional level (28.Kelley W.L. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 2574-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29.Filutowicz M. Davis G. Greener A. Helinski D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), (ii) it promotes pairing between the two sets of 7 iterons of γ present in 2 daughter plasmids and shuts down their replication. This pairing mechanism has been called handcuffing (5.Pal S.K. Chattoraj D.K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3554-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.McEachern M.J. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1C). Using the F plasmid as a model system, we have shown in vitro that dimeric initiators cause origin shutdown by promoting handcuffing in cis between the origin iterons and a second set of iterons located at incC (incompatibility), which is a negative regulatory element of plasmid maintenance. The dimeric initiator protein, RepE-mediated iteron pairing blocks the melting of the AT-rich region at the F plasmid origin (30.Zzaman S. Bastia D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In summary, the existing paradigm of replication control, based on the data from several different plasmid systems, is that dimeric initiators are negative regulators of copy control and of initiation of replication where as the monomeric form catalyzes replication in association with other proteins and that the monomer-dimer equilibrium in the host cell contributes to plasmid copy number control.The present work was designed to address two mechanistic questions about DNA looping-dependent replication control in R6K: (i) do DNA looping in vitro and replication activation at α and β in vivo both require the dimeric and the monomeric forms of π? (ii) why does iteron-iteron interaction, which generally suppresses replication initiation at iteron-regulated plasmid origins (6.McEachern M.J. Bott M.A. Tooker P.A. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 7942-7946Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30.Zzaman S. Bastia D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), induce replication at ori α rather than its repression? Using an in vitro DNA-looping assay (30.Zzaman S. Bastia D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and in vivo replication/plasmid maintenance measurements, we show that both intrachromosomal, π-mediated iteron-iteron pairing, and looping out of the intervening DNA and plasmid maintenance in vivo by α require not only the monomeric but also the dimeric form of π. Using an iteron swap experiment in vivo, we show further that origin activation requires very transient, weak interactions between the α and γ iterons. Enhancement of the looping interaction by replacement of the weak α iteron with a consensus, stronger γ iteron without changing the original sequence context, did not cause a corresponding enhancement of ori α activity. Rather, the stronger looping reaction between the 2 iterons generated by the iteron swap greatly diminished plasmid maintenance in vivo. The mutant forms of the dimeric π that did not bind to DNA could neither collaborate with the monomeric π to promote DNA looping in vitro nor induce replication initiation from ori α in vivo, thereby supporting the interpretation that both monomer-dimer protein-protein interaction and binding of each form of the protein with DNA, are essential for productive initiation at α.DISCUSSIONIt is known that a regulatory protein such as a prokaryotic transcriptional repressor (e.g. gal repressor, λ repressor) can also act as a transcriptional activator depending on the relative location of the operator with respect to the RNA polymerase binding site (38.Ptashne M. Genetic Switch. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, NY2004Google Scholar, 39.Choy H.E. Hanger R.R. Aki T. Mahoney M. Murakami K. Ishihama A. Adhya S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). If the regulatory protein binding site overlaps the promoter and blocks its access to RNA polymerase, it is likely to act as a repressor of transcription. If on the other hand, the repressor binding site is located in such a way that its binding to the cognate site allows it to touch the RNA polymerase bound to the promoter and stabilizes the enzyme binding, then it can act as a transcriptional activator (40.Ptashne M. Gann A.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 41.Bushman F.D. Ptashne M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 9353-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is the sequence context rather than the repressor-operator binding affinity that determines whether such a protein would act as a repressor or an activator of transcription. In contrast, as shown in this work, a replication initiator protein can also serve either as an activator or a repressor of replication (e.g. at ori α) not because of the sequence context of its binding site(s) at the ori but apparently by the relative affinity of the initiator for the iteron (9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the avidity of iteron pairing.Precisely, how does iteron-iteron pairing either activate or repress origin activity? From our work with another plasmid system, namely F (30.Zzaman S. Bastia D. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 833-843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it appears that iteron pairing leads to abolition of unwinding of the AT-rich region of the ori thereby blocking replication initiation. To uncover such information in R6K, the α-γ replicon needs to be studied using a reconstituted in vitro replication system (21.Zzaman S. Reddy J.M. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50886-50894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33.Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Büllesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It would be useful to determine, by using a partial reaction catalyzed by purified wt π, DnaJ-DnaK-GrpE chaperone system, IHF, DnaA, and ATP, precisely where in the vicinity of the genetically defined oriα, DNA melting occurs, and whether a stronger iteron-iteron interaction, such as that caused by the α-γ iteron swap, would lead to abolition of the ori melting at α. It should also be instructive to determine whether there is an inverse relationship between ori melting at α versus that at γ in a α-γ replicon. These experiments might explain in the future (i) a molecular basis of ori activation versus repression and (ii) also might illuminate the mechanism(s) that ensures that only one origin fires at any given time in a multi-origin prokaryotic replicon (11.Crosa J.H. Luttropp L.K. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). What is the stoichiometry of a productive looped complex at the ori? Although we have postulated that it could be a monomer bound to each one of the paired iterons that are bridged by a single dimer, this model needs to be tested by further work.Although, the present work shows that not only π cop monomers but also wt dimers are both needed their DNA binding activities to form an activating looping complex; in another plasmid system, called RK2, it was reported that runaway replication caused by monomerization of the initiator protein called TrfA could be damped down by intracellular co-expression of mutant forms of the dimeric initiator that itself could not bind to DNA (42.Toukdarian A.E. Helinski D.R. Gene. 1998; 223: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). R6K dimeric π is somewhat different from other plasmid-encoded initiator dimers in that π dimers bind to iteron DNA albeit with much lower affinity in comparison with the monomeric form. In other plasmid systems, dimeric initiators mostly do not bind to DNA (43.Zzaman S. Abhyankar M.M. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17404-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It appears that π dimers need to contact DNA while bridging a pair of iteron-bound monomers to form a stable looped structure at or near the replication origins of R6K.Are there separate domains in π for dimerization on one hand and for dimer-monomer or dimer-dimer interactions on the other? Previous work shows that mutations in the unstructured area of π (18.Swan M.K. Bastia D. Davies C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18481-18486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32.Krüger R. Konieczny I. Filutowicz M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A) such as amino acid residues 106–108 cause high copy phenotype and here we have shown that the mutant forms of the protein but not wt π are induced to monomerize by iteron binding. The residues 106–108 mostly likely affect the dimerization domain of π. We have previously reported that a specific selection screen for the isolation of nonlooping mutants of π yielded the mutation P42L that prevented DNA looping (9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Clearly, the latter site is well separated, in a linear dimension from the residues 106–108. However, the crystal structure reveals that the residues are not far apart in the folded three-dimensional structure of the protein (18.Swan M.K. Bastia D. Davies C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18481-18486Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is possible that the Pro-42 residue is an indicator of a domain for dimer-monomer interaction that is separate from the dimerization domain. The repressor of phage λ appears to contain domains for both dimer-dimer interaction and dimerization that seem to be located very close to each other (44.Koudelka G.B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R704-R707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Do host-encoded proteins modulate π-mediated looping interaction? We have previously reported that π interacts with a number of replisomal proteins such as DnaA, DnaB, DnaG, etc. (25.Ratnakar P.V. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Lu Y.B. Datta H.J. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5192-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A short range looping interaction that promoted plasmid-encoded initiator and DnaA interaction was promoted by host-encoded DNA-bending protein IHF. Furthermore, interaction between the plasmid-encoded initiator RepA with host-encoded DnaA enhances short range DNA looping at the plasmid ori (45.Stenzel T.T. MacAllister T. Bastia D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore it is conceivable that interaction of π with host replisomal protein(s) could modulate π-mediated DNA looping.In conclusion, the availability of a crystal structure, a reconstituted in vitro replication system, and abundant biological information (including numerous mutants) recommend R6K as an outstanding model system to further investigate the roles of long range DNA-protein interactions in replication control. Further molecular analysis of this mechanism might provide useful pointers to the study of parallel mechanisms in eukaryotes. The advent of the techniques such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) (46.Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) and circular chromosome conformation capture analyses (4C) (47.Ohlsson R. Göndör A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have uncovered long range intra and interchromosomal interactions in eukaryotes that appear to play important roles in effecting and controlling transcription, immunoglobulin switching, and other important DNA transactions (27.Jhunjhunwala S. van Zelm M.C.

Perhaps it is just a matter of time before similar intrachromosomal and interchromosomal interactions controlling DNA replication might be revealed by further work. IntroductionInvestigations of bacterial plasmid replicons have been invaluable in revealing the mechanism of replication initiation, termination, and copy number control (1.Chattoraj D.K. Snyder K.M.

There are generally three types of replication initiation mechanism in plasmids: (i) control by an antisense repressor RNA that hybridizes to the primer RNA and negatively regulates initiation frequency and copy control, as in the case of Col E1(4.Tomizawa J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), (ii) binding of an initiator protein to short repeated DNA sequences called iterons located at an ori (5.Pal S.K.

Murray R.W. Koepsel R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The plasmid R6K has 3 origins of replication called α, γ, and β, and all three are functionally dependent upon the plasmid-encoded initiator protein called π (Refs. 9.Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D.

The π protein binds to γ but not to the α and β iterons; the latter requires the presence of ori γ sequence in cis for initiating replication and enabling plasmid maintenance (13.Mukherjee S.
