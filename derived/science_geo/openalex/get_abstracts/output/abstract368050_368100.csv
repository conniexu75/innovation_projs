https://openalex.org/W2048376025,"The antitumour drug rapamycin targets TOR, a kinase that is part of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR cascade, involved in regulating protein translation, cell growth and autophagy. Reducing TOR function is known to extend the life of yeast, worms and flies. Now experiments replicated in three different laboratories demonstrate that rapamycin, fed to male and female mice in a dose that substantially inhibits TOR signalling, can extend their median and maximal lifespan by up to 14%. This life extension was observed in mice fed rapamycin from 270 days of age and also at a late stage in their life, from age 600 days. These findings point to the TOR pathway as a critical point in the control of ageing in mammals and in the pathogenesis of late-life illnesses. Although inhibition of the TOR signalling pathway extends lifespan in invertebrates, it was unknown whether mTOR signalling inhibition has similar effects in mammalian species. Here, feeding mice the drug rapamycin — an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway — late in life is shown to extend lifespan by 9–14%; currently, the only way to extend lifespan in rodents is by severe dietary restriction. Inhibition of the TOR signalling pathway by genetic or pharmacological intervention extends lifespan in invertebrates, including yeast, nematodes and fruitflies1,2,3,4,5; however, whether inhibition of mTOR signalling can extend lifespan in a mammalian species was unknown. Here we report that rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, extends median and maximal lifespan of both male and female mice when fed beginning at 600 days of age. On the basis of age at 90% mortality, rapamycin led to an increase of 14% for females and 9% for males. The effect was seen at three independent test sites in genetically heterogeneous mice, chosen to avoid genotype-specific effects on disease susceptibility. Disease patterns of rapamycin-treated mice did not differ from those of control mice. In a separate study, rapamycin fed to mice beginning at 270 days of age also increased survival in both males and females, based on an interim analysis conducted near the median survival point. Rapamycin may extend lifespan by postponing death from cancer, by retarding mechanisms of ageing, or both. To our knowledge, these are the first results to demonstrate a role for mTOR signalling in the regulation of mammalian lifespan, as well as pharmacological extension of lifespan in both genders. These findings have implications for further development of interventions targeting mTOR for the treatment and prevention of age-related diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2079599988,"An open chromatin largely devoid of heterochromatin is a hallmark of stem cells. It remains unknown whether an open chromatin is necessary for the differentiation potential of stem cells, and which molecules are needed to maintain open chromatin. Here we show that the chromatin remodelling factor Chd1 is required to maintain the open chromatin of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells. Chd1 is a euchromatin protein that associates with the promoters of active genes, and downregulation of Chd1 leads to accumulation of heterochromatin. Chd1-deficient embryonic stem cells are no longer pluripotent, because they are incapable of giving rise to primitive endoderm and have a high propensity for neural differentiation. Furthermore, Chd1 is required for efficient reprogramming of fibroblasts to the pluripotent stem cell state. Our results indicate that Chd1 is essential for open chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and for somatic cell reprogramming to the pluripotent state. In many stem cells, from flatworms to mammals, the chromatin is largely devoid of the condensed from, heterochromatin, so is openly accessible to transcriptional regulators. An RNA interference screen for novel regulators in mouse embryo cells now shows that the chromatin remodelling factor Chd1 is essential for the maintenance of open chromatin and pluripotency of embryonic cells, and for somatic cell reprogramming to pluripotency. This is direct evidence of a causal relationship between open chromatin and pluripotency. Chd1 is highly expressed in both germline and adult stem cells, raising the possibility that the relationship between open chromatin and differentiation potential of stem cells is a general phenomenon. A hallmark of stem cells is an open chromatin largely devoid of heterochromatin, but which molecules are required to maintain it is unknown, as well as whether an open chromatin is necessary for the differentiation potential of stem cells. Here, the chromatin remodelling factor Chd1 is shown to be required to maintain the open chromatin state of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells and to be essential for the pluripotency of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2113381337,"Neural circuits are exquisitely organized, consisting of many different neuronal subpopulations. However, it is difficult to assess the functional roles of these subpopulations using conventional extracellular recording techniques because these techniques do not easily distinguish spikes from different neuronal populations. To overcome this limitation, we have developed PINP (Photostimulation-assisted Identification of Neuronal Populations), a method of tagging neuronal populations for identification during in vivo electrophysiological recording. The method is based on expressing the light-activated channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to restricted neuronal subpopulations. ChR2-tagged neurons can be detected electrophysiologically in vivo since illumination of these neurons with a brief flash of blue light triggers a short latency reliable action potential. We demonstrate the feasibility of this technique by expressing ChR2 in distinct populations of cortical neurons using two different strategies. First, we labeled a subpopulation of cortical neurons—mainly fast-spiking interneurons—by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver ChR2 in a transgenic mouse line in which the expression of Cre recombinase was driven by the parvalbumin promoter. Second, we labeled subpopulations of excitatory neurons in the rat auditory cortex with ChR2 based on projection target by using herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), which is efficiently taken up by axons and transported retrogradely; we find that this latter population responds to acoustic stimulation differently from unlabeled neurons. Tagging neurons is a novel application of ChR2, used in this case to monitor activity instead of manipulating it. PINP can be readily extended to other populations of genetically identifiable neurons, and will provide a useful method for probing the functional role of different neuronal populations in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2112945450,"Virtually all massive galaxies, including our own, host central black holes ranging in mass from millions to billions of solar masses. The growth of these black holes releases vast amounts of energy that powers quasars and other weaker active galactic nuclei. A tiny fraction of this energy, if absorbed by the host galaxy, could halt star formation by heating and ejecting ambient gas. A central question in galaxy evolution is the degree to which this process has caused the decline of star formation in large elliptical galaxies, which typically have little cold gas and few young stars, unlike spiral galaxies."
https://openalex.org/W2160825263,"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have initiated an era of personal genome sequences. To date, human genome sequences have been reported for individuals with ancestry in three distinct geographical regions: a Yoruba African, two individuals of northwest European origin, and a person from China. Here we provide a highly annotated, whole-genome sequence for a Korean individual, known as AK1. The genome of AK1 was determined by an exacting, combined approach that included whole-genome shotgun sequencing (27.8x coverage), targeted bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing, and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization using custom microarrays featuring more than 24 million probes. Alignment to the NCBI reference, a composite of several ethnic clades, disclosed nearly 3.45 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 10,162 non-synonymous SNPs, and 170,202 deletion or insertion polymorphisms (indels). SNP and indel densities were strongly correlated genome-wide. Applying very conservative criteria yielded highly reliable copy number variants for clinical considerations. Potential medical phenotypes were annotated for non-synonymous SNPs, coding domain indels, and structural variants. The integration of several human whole-genome sequences derived from several ethnic groups will assist in understanding genetic ancestry, migration patterns and population bottlenecks."

https://openalex.org/W2003607991,"The main purpose of this study is to compare two different feedback controllers for the stabilization of quiet standing in humans, taking into account that the intrinsic ankle stiffness is insufficient and that there is a large delay inducing instability in the feedback loop: 1) a standard linear, continuous-time PD controller and 2) an intermittent PD controller characterized by a switching function defined in the phase plane, with or without a dead zone around the nominal equilibrium state. The stability analysis of the first controller is carried out by using the standard tools of linear control systems, whereas the analysis of the intermittent controllers is based on the use of Poincaré maps defined in the phase plane. When the PD-control is off, the dynamics of the system is characterized by a saddle-like equilibrium, with a stable and an unstable manifold. The switching function of the intermittent controller is implemented in such a way that PD-control is ‘off’ when the state vector is near the stable manifold of the saddle and is ‘on’ otherwise. A theoretical analysis and a related simulation study show that the intermittent control model is much more robust than the standard model because the size of the region in the parameter space of the feedback control gains (P vs. D) that characterizes stable behavior is much larger in the latter case than in the former one. Moreover, the intermittent controller can use feedback parameters that are much smaller than the standard model. Typical sway patterns generated by the intermittent controller are the result of an alternation between slow motion along the stable manifold of the saddle, when the PD-control is off, and spiral motion away from the upright equilibrium determined by the activation of the PD-control with low feedback gains. Remarkably, overall dynamic stability can be achieved by combining in a smart way two unstable regimes: a saddle and an unstable spiral. The intermittent controller exploits the stabilizing effect of one part of the saddle, letting the system evolve by alone when it slides on or near the stable manifold; when the state vector enters the strongly unstable part of the saddle it switches on a mild feedback which is not supposed to impose a strict stable regime but rather to mitigate the impending fall. The presence of a dead zone in the intermittent controller does not alter the stability properties but improves the similarity with biological sway patterns. The two types of controllers are also compared in the frequency domain by considering the power spectral density (PSD) of the sway sequences generated by the models with additive noise. Different from the standard continuous model, whose PSD function is similar to an over-damped second order system without a resonance, the intermittent control model is capable to exhibit the two power law scaling regimes that are typical of physiological sway movements in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1982284443,"Background Australia's dinosaurian fossil record is exceptionally poor compared to that of other similar-sized continents. Most taxa are known from fragmentary isolated remains with uncertain taxonomic and phylogenetic placement. A better understanding of the Australian dinosaurian record is crucial to understanding the global palaeobiogeography of dinosaurian groups, including groups previously considered to have had Gondwanan origins, such as the titanosaurs and carcharodontosaurids. Methodology/Principal Findings We describe three new dinosaurs from the late Early Cretaceous (latest Albian) Winton Formation of eastern Australia, including; Wintonotitan wattsi gen. et sp. nov., a basal titanosauriform; Diamantinasaurus matildae gen. et sp. nov., a derived lithostrotian titanosaur; and Australovenator wintonensis gen. et sp. nov., an allosauroid. We compare an isolated astragalus from the Early Cretaceous of southern Australia; formerly identified as Allosaurus sp., and conclude that it most-likely represents Australovenator sp. Conclusion/Significance The occurrence of Australovenator from the Aptian to latest Albian confirms the presence in Australia of allosauroids basal to the Carcharodontosauridae. These new taxa, along with the fragmentary remains of other taxa, indicate a diverse Early Cretaceous sauropod and theropod fauna in Australia, including plesiomorphic forms (e.g. Wintonotitan and Australovenator) and more derived forms (e.g. Diamantinasaurus)."

https://openalex.org/W2008216530,"Ferredoxin (Fd) is the major iron-containing protein in photosynthetic organisms and is central to reductive metabolism in the chloroplast. The Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome encodes six plant type [Fe2S2] ferredoxins, products of PETF, FDX2–FDX6. We performed the functional analysis of these ferredoxins by localizing Fd, Fdx2, Fdx3, and Fdx6 to the chloroplast by using isoform-specific antibodies and monitoring the pattern of gene expression by iron and copper nutrition, nitrogen source, and hydrogen peroxide stress. In addition, we also measured the midpoint redox potentials of Fd and Fdx2 and determined the kinetic parameters of their reactions with several ferredoxin-interacting proteins, namely nitrite reductase, Fd:NADP+ oxidoreductase, and Fd:thioredoxin reductase. We found that each of the FDX genes is differently regulated in response to changes in nutrient supply. Moreover, we show that Fdx2 (Em = −321 mV), whose expression is regulated by nitrate, is a more efficient electron donor to nitrite reductase relative to Fd. Overall, the results suggest that each ferredoxin isoform has substrate specificity and that the presence of multiple ferredoxin isoforms allows for the allocation of reducing power to specific metabolic pathways in the chloroplast under various growth conditions.

Ferredoxins are small (∼11,000-kDa), soluble, iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins with strongly negative redox potentials (−350 to −450 mV) that function as electron donors at reductive steps in various metabolic pathways (1Fukuyama K.

In photosynthetic organisms, the well studied ferredoxin (Fd 4The abbreviations used are: FdferredoxinPSIphotosystem IFNRFd:NADP+ oxidoreductaseNiRnitrite reductaseTRXthioredoxinFTRFd:thioredoxin reductaseTAPTris acetate-phosphateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. ; the product of the PETF gene) is the most abundant iron-containing protein in the chloroplast and is central to the distribution of photosynthetically derived reductive power (4Merchant S.

The most well known Fd-dependent reaction is the transfer of electrons from photosystem I (PSI) to NADPH, catalyzed by Fd:NADP+ oxidoreductase (FNR). The NADPH produced by this reaction donates electrons to the only reductant-requiring step in the Calvin cycle and other steps in anabolic pathways that require NADPH as reductant. In addition, reduced Fd directly donates electrons to other metabolic pathways by interacting with various enzymes in the chloroplast. This includes Fd:thioredoxin reductase (FTR), which converts a light-driven electron signal into a thiol signal that is transmitted to thioredoxins (TRXs) present in the plastid as different types (or different isoforms). Once reduced, TRXs interact with specific disulfide bonds on target enzymes, modulating their activities (5Lemaire S.D. Michelet L. Zaffagnini M. Massot V. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Curr. Genet. 2007; 51: 343-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Other Fd targets include hydrogenase, which is responsible for hydrogen production in anaerobic conditions in green algae; glutamine-oxoglutarate amidotransferase in amino acid synthesis; nitrite and sulfite reductases in nitrate and sulfate assimilation, respectively; stearoyl-ACP Δ9-desaturase in fatty acid desaturation; and phycocyanobilin:Fd oxidoreductase in synthesis of phytochromobilin (6Hase T. Schürmann P. Knaff D.B. Golbeck J.H. Photosystem I: The Light-Driven Plastocyanin:Ferredoxin Oxidoreductase. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006Google Scholar). Fd also functions in non-photosynthetic cells. Here, FNR catalyzes the reduction of Fd by NADPH produced in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, enabling Fd-dependent metabolism to occur in the dark (7Bowsher C.G. Boulton E.L. Rose J.

The Chlamydomonas genome encodes six highly related plant type ferredoxin genes (9Merchant S.S. Allen M.D. Kropat J. Moseley J.L. Long J.C. Tottey S. Terauchi A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 578-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Until recently, only the major photosynthetic ferredoxin, Fd (encoded by PETF), which mediates electron transfer between PSI and FNR, had been characterized in detail (14Schmitter J.M. Jacquot J.P. de Lamotte-Guéry F. Beauvallet C. Dutka S. Gadal P. Decottignies P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Many land plants are known to have multiple ferredoxins. Typically, they are differently localized on the basis of their function. Photosynthetic ferredoxins reduce NADP+ at a faster rate and are localized to the leaves, whereas non-photosynthetic ferredoxins are more efficiently reduced by NADPH and are localized to the roots. Arabidopsis thaliana has a total of six ferredoxin isoforms (15Hanke G.T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Taniguchi I. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Of these, two are photosynthetic and localized in the leaves. The most abundant, AtFd2, is involved in linear electron flow, and the less abundant (5% of the ferredoxin pool), AtFd1, has been implicated in cyclic electron flow (16Hanke G.T. Endo T. Satoh F. Hase T. Plant Cell Environ. 2008; 31: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). There is one non-photosynthetic ferredoxin located in the roots, AtFd3, which is nitrate-inducible. This protein has higher electron transfer activity with sulfite reductase in in vitro assays compared with other Arabidopsis ferredoxin isoforms, suggesting in vivo function of AtFd3 in nitrate and sulfate assimilation (15Hanke G.T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Taniguchi I. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Wang R. Guegler K. LaBrie S.T. Crawford N.M. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1491-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In addition, there is one evolutionarily distant ferredoxin, AtFd4, of unknown function with a more positive redox potential present in the leaves and two other proteins which are “ferredoxin-like” and uncharacterized (15Hanke G.T. Kimata-Ariga Y. Taniguchi I. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Zea mays has four ferredoxin isoforms, two photosynthetic and two non-photosynthetic (18Hase T. Mizutani S. Mukohata Y. Plant Physiol. 1991; 97: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). One of the non-photosynthetic isoforms is specifically induced by nitrite, suggestive of a role in nitrate metabolism (19Matsumura T. Sakakibara H. Nakano R. Kimata Y. Sugiyama T. Hase T. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A cyanobacterium, Anabaena 7120, has two ferredoxins, vegetative and heterocyst type (by analogy to leaf and root types, respectively). The heterocyst type is present only in cells that have differentiated into nitrogen-fixing cells, indicating that this form may serve to transfer electrons to nitrogenase (20Schrautemeier B. Böhme H. FEBS Lett. 1985; 184: 304-308Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the presence of as many as six ferredoxin isoforms in a single-celled organism like C. reinhardtii allows for the differential regulation of each isoform and therefore the prioritization of reducing power toward certain metabolic pathways under changing environmental conditions. To test this hypothesis, expression of the genes (PETF and FDX2–FDX6) encoding the six ferredoxin isoforms in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was monitored under various conditions in which well characterized ferredoxin-dependent enzymes are known to be expressed. In addition, we also analyzed the interaction of Fd and Fdx2 with several ferredoxin-interacting proteins, such as NiR, FNR, and FTR, and determined the kinetic parameters of the corresponding reactions. We found that each of the FDX genes is indeed differently regulated in response to changes in nutrient supply. In the case of FDX2 whose product is most similar to classical Fd, we suggest that it has specificity for nitrite reductase based on its pattern of expression and activity with nitrite reductase. C. reinhardtii strains 17D−, CC124, CC125, CC425 (cw15 arg2), 704 (cw15 nit2+ Nia1:ars) (21Loppes R. Radoux M. Ohresser M.C. Matagne R.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), 21gr (CC1690, Nit5−), and 2137 (CC1021) were used in this study. Starter cultures were maintained in the standard Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium at 24 °C at a light intensity of 95 μmol m−2 s−1 light and constant shaking at 180 rpm. For analysis of the effects of ammonium versus nitrate in strain 21gr, nitrogen-free TAP medium was prepared, and 7.5 mm NH4Cl or 4 mm KNO3 was added as a nitrogen source. The establishment of copper deficiency and treatment of cells with nickel were conducted as described previously (22Kropat J. Tottey S. Birkenbihl R.P. Depège N. Huijser P. Merchant S. Proc. Natl.

Cultures were inoculated from a starter culture to a final concentration of 105 cells/ml. Cells were collected for RNA and protein isolation at mid-log phase when the culture reached a density of 2–5 × 106 cells/ml. Chloroplasts and mitochondria were isolated according to procedures described previously (24Long J.C. Sommer F. Allen M.D. Lu S.F. Merchant S.S.

Cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in 50 ml of breaking buffer (0.3 m sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40, and broken in a Yeda press (4.5 bars, 30 s). The broken cells were fractionated by centrifugation (1000 × g, 5 min). The supernatant (containing mitochondria) was processed as in Ref. 26Eriksson M. Gardestrom P. Samuelsson G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar except that the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.25 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and assayed for purity by immunoblot. The pellet fraction (containing chloroplasts) was washed twice in 50 ml of breaking buffer, resuspended in 20 ml, loaded onto a 45/75% (12 ml each) Percoll step gradient, and separated by centrifugation (9300 × g, 20 min). Intact chloroplasts were collected at the 45/75% interface and were washed twice in 200 ml of breaking buffer (1000 × g, 5 min). Isolated chloroplasts were resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and assayed for purity by immunoblot. Plasmid constructs for expressing recombinant ferredoxins were constructed by standard molecular biology methods using expression vector pET21b and gene-specific primer sets. The N termini of recombinant Fdx2–Fdx6 were predicted based on sequence alignment with the PETF gene product (Fig. 1A). The stop codon of each gene was included, resulting in untagged recombinant protein. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing and co-transformed with pLysRARE (Novagen) into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. Cultures (1 liter) were grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.7 prior to the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and FeSO4 (50 μm). After 16 h, cells were collected by centrifugation (4400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 10 ml of cold 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm NaCl and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were broken by one cycle of freezing and thawing, followed by sonication on ice (Fisher model 550 sonic dismembrator, large tip, 70% intensity, 10 cycles of 1 min on, 1 min off). To completely break the cells, the sample was also passed three times though a French pressure cell operated at 17,000 p.s.i. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (110,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h). The supernatant was treated with DNase I (1 μg/ml) and streptomycin sulfate (0.3% w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (48,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was dialyzed three times (2, 12, and 3 h) against 2 liters of 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.4, plus 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) containing 0.1 m NaCl and centrifuged again (48,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was loaded onto a DE52 anion exchange column (2.6 × 5 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl, and a gradient of NaCl (0.1-1 m in Buffer A, 370 ml) was applied. Reddish colored fractions were collected, and their spectra were recorded. Protein samples were concentrated (Millipore Ultracel YM-3) to 5 ml, and the salt concentration was reduced by the addition of 35 ml of Buffer A. Samples were loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column (1.6 × 10 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl, and a gradient of NaCl (0.1-1 m in Buffer A, 180 ml) was applied. Fractions were collected and concentrated as before and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 HR gel filtration column (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl. All chromatographic runs were performed at a constant flow rate of 1 ml/min. For purification of Chlamydomonas Fd, strain CC425 was grown in TAP medium (15 liters) supplemented with 100 μg/ml arginine under a photon flux density of 25 μmol photons m−2 s−1. When the cell density reached 1 × 107 cells/ml, cells were collected by centrifugation (4400 × g, 5 min, 4 °C); resuspended in 200 ml of 20 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl; and lysed by two cycles of freezing (−20 °C) and thawing (room temperature), followed by another cycle of freezing and thawing with liquid nitrogen. Insoluble particles were removed by ultracentrifugation (110,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), and Fd was purified according to the procedures described for recombinant ferredoxin. Total RNA was extracted from Chlamydomonas cells, and quantitative real time PCR was performed as described in Ref. 25Allen M.D. Kropat J. Tottey S. Del Campo J.A. Merchant S.S. Plant Physiol. 2007; 143: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar using gene-specific primers with an efficiency of 90–100% (Table 1). Melting curves were performed after the PCR to assess the presence of a unique final product, and the product was sequenced from one reaction to verify that it represented the gene of interest. The data are presented as the -fold change in mRNA abundance, normalized to an endogenous reference gene (CBLP or UBI2), relative to either the sample grown in nutrient-replete TAP medium. The abundance of CBLP or UBI2 did not change under the conditions tested in this work.TABLE 1Ferredoxin primers used for real time PCRGene nameProtein IDEfficiencyPrimer pair%PETF14778795GTGTCCTTCGTCGCCACTCAGTAGGTGTCAGCGGGGCACTFDX215916199ATGGACCTGCCCTACTCGTGTCGCTGCCTTTAGAGCTTGFDX319670795AGCAGCACCCTAGCCAGCACTGATGCCCTTCGACTCCACAFDX419670594CTGCCAGGTCAAGACCATTTCTGTCCTCATCCGGTCATCTFDX515683392ACCATCCTCACGCACCAGCCCCTCCGTTGCGTGATAAAFDX619670397GCCGGTGCACAAGATCAAGAGCAGCTCCAGACCCTTGTCC Open table in a new tab Chlamydomonas proteins were extracted essentially as described previously (25Allen M.D. Kropat J.

Cells were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, resuspended in the same buffer to a concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml, and stored at −80 °C. For denaturing gel electrophoresis, cells were lysed by freeze/thaw cycling and separated into soluble and membrane components by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min) as described in Ref. 27Howe G. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2789-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar. The pellet was washed once and resuspended to the same volume as that of the soluble fraction. Protein concentration was determined by the Lowry method against a bovine serum albumin standard. Antibodies that were specific to Fd, Fdx2, Fdx3, and Fdx6 were supplied by Agrisera (Umeå, Sweden). The synthetic peptides NH2-CTIQTHQEEALY-COOH (Fd), NH2-CIVILTDQESKL-COOH (Fdx2), NH2-RPEPTMGKGWAELQK-COOH (Fdx3), and NH2-IERDDYALSIANMDE-COOH (Fdx6) used as immunogen (Fig. 1) were designed by Environmental Proteomics (Sackville, Canada). Proteins were separated on SDS-containing polyacrylamide gels (15%) and transferred in a semidry blotter onto polyvinylidene difluoride (0.45 μm; Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 90 min under constant current (400 mA) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% (w/v) dry milk in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) with 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20. Membranes were incubated in primary antisera diluted in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 90 min (Fdx5 was incubated for 5 h). Primary antibody dilutions were as follows: Fd, 1:10,000; Fdx2, 1:1000; NiR, 1:500; CF1, 1:10,000; Cox2b, 1:5000; ketoacid reductoisomerase, 1:10,000; Fdx3, 1:1000; Fdx5, 1:1000; Fdx6, 1:1000. After primary antibody treatment, membranes were washed three times in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 5 min. The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates) used at 1:3000 or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) used at 1:25,000. Bound antibody was detected using either the alkaline phosphatase color reaction as described by Sambrook and Russell (28Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A9.39-A9.42Google Scholar) or the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), respectively. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed using a conventional three-electrode system connected to a BAS 100-watt potentiostat (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). A glass slide coated with indium-doped tin oxide served as the working electrode (SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA), a platinum wire served as the auxiliary, and the reference was an Ag|AgCl electrode in a 3 m NaCl filling solution (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN). All experiments were performed under an N2 atmosphere inside a glove box. The experimental procedure was modeled from one developed by Avila et al. (29Avila L. Wirtz M. Bunce R.A. Rivera M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 4: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The protein samples were prepared for analysis by overnight dialysis (Slide-A-Lyzer MINI dialysis units; 3500 molecular weight cut-off; Pierce) into 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, and were subsequently transferred into the glove box. A cationic electrode-modifying agent, poly-l-lysine, was added to the sample solution. The solution was then diluted with excess buffer to give nominal concentrations of 100 and 300 μm for the sample and poly-l-lysine, respectively. The solution volume in all cases was 400 μl. Over the range of scan rates examined, the peak current varied linearly with the square root of the scan rate, indicative of a diffusion-controlled process occurring at the electrode surface. Chemical reversibility was judged by the ratio of cathodic to anodic peak currents, and the electrochemical reversibility was judged by the separation of cathodic and anodic peak potentials. Spinach ferredoxin was measured as a reference. Reduction of nitrite to ammonium by NiR was monitored as a function of Fd concentration. Reactions (0.5 ml, 25 °C) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm NaNO2, 100 nm NiR (from Chlamydomonas (purified according to Ref. 30Tripathy J.N. Hirasawa M. Kim S.K. Setterdahl A.T.

Plant Physiol. 1985; 78: 374-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values for Fd or Fdx2 were determined using ferredoxin ranging from 1 to 50 μm. Three independent experiments were performed at each ferredoxin concentration, and the Km and kcat values were calculated by non-linear regression using the program Origin. Electron transfer between ferredoxin and FNR was measured indirectly as the reduction of cytochrome c by ferredoxin.

The reduction of cytochrome c was monitored by the increase of absorbance at A550, and rates were calculated using a molar absorption coefficient of 20 mm−1 cm−1. For measurement of C. reinhardtii FNR-cytochrome c reductase activity, reactions (0.5 ml, 25 °C) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 180 μm NADPH, 40 μm horse heart cytochrome c, 6 nm FNR (33Decottignies P.

The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) values for Fd or Fdx2 were determined using ferredoxin ranging from 0.5 to 60 μm. Three independent experiments were performed at each ferredoxin concentration, and the Km and kcat values were calculated by non-linear regression using the program Origin. Activation of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (10 μm) by recombinant Arabidopsis TRXf1 (10 μm) was carried out in a reconstituted system composed of thylakoid membranes (34Droux M. Jacquot J.P.

Three independent experiments were performed at each ferredoxin concentration. The release of the Chlamydomonas genome allowed us to search for genes similar to PETF. Five previously uncharacterized ferredoxin-encoding genes were identified. The cDNAs encoding each ferredoxin were sequenced and named FDX2–FDX6. The six ferredoxin-encoding genes are highly similar at the primary sequence level. They all contain the motif CX4CX2CXnC and therefore classify as plant type [Fe2S2] ferredoxins (37Bertini I. Luchinat C. Provenzani A. Rosato A. Vasos P.R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 46: 110-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The PETF transcript is the most abundant of the ferredoxin-encoding transcripts in cells grown in normal TAP medium, whereas FDX2–FDX6 each contributes less than 1% to the total ferredoxin-encoding gene pool (Fig. 1C). The PETF and FDX2 gene products (Fd and Fdx2, respectively) are the most similar, sharing 82% sequence identity (Fig. 1A). Fdx3 and Fdx6 are the most divergent, containing long N- and C-terminal extensions. In phylogenetic analysis comparing ferredoxin sequences in the green evolutionary lineage, ferredoxin isoforms seemed to cluster together based on functionality rather than by organism (Fig. 1B). Fdx2 clustered with non-photosynthetic root type ferredoxins. Fd and Fdx5 clustered near photosynthetic leaf type ferredoxins, although Fdx5 is much more divergent. Fdx3, Fdx4, and Fdx6 have most likely evolved specialized functions, since they do not cluster with leaf or root type ferredoxins. Furthermore, the occurrence of related ferredoxin isoforms in other plants and algae suggest that these specialized functions are conserved in the plant lineage (Fig. 1B). To study the function of each ferredoxin isoform, we sought to localize each protein product, since compartmentalization provides clues to function. Although C. reinhardtii Fd was originally isolated in 1966, the actual gene product of PETF has never been uniquely distinguished and localized (38Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Plant Physiol. 1966; 41: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were generated against antigenic peptides corresponding to unique regions of the predicted protein sequences encoded by PETF, FDX2, FDX3, and FDX6 (Fig. 1A). In order to verify the specificity of each antibody, each ferredoxin isoform was expressed in E. coli, and equal amounts of soluble lysate corresponding to each ferredoxin isoform were analyzed by immunoblot with each antibody. All antibodies showed high selectivity for their respective antigens, and no cross-reaction between ferredoxin species was detected (Fig. 2). This enabled us to determine the subcellular location of Fd, Fdx2, Fdx3, and Fdx6. Chloroplasts and mitochondria were purified by density gradient centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). We assessed the purity of each fraction by immunoblot analysis of chloroplast-localized ketoacid reductoisomerase, which was present exclusively in the chloroplast fraction, and Cox2b (cytochrome oxidase), a protein of the inner mito"
https://openalex.org/W1990909659,"Variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination assembles immunoglobulin heavy or light chain (IgH or IgL) variable region exons in developing bone marrow B cells, whereas class switch recombination (CSR) exchanges IgH constant region exons in peripheral B cells. Both processes use directed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Errors in either V(D)J recombination or CSR can initiate chromosomal translocations, including oncogenic IgH locus (Igh) to c-myc (also known as Myc) translocations of peripheral B cell lymphomas. Collaboration between these processes has also been proposed to initiate translocations. However, the occurrence of V(D)J recombination in peripheral B cells is controversial. Here we show that activated NHEJ-deficient splenic B cells accumulate V(D)J-recombination-associated breaks at the lambda IgL locus (Igl), as well as CSR-associated Igh breaks, often in the same cell. Moreover, Igl and Igh breaks are frequently joined to form translocations, a phenomenon associated with specific Igh-Igl co-localization. Igh and c-myc also co-localize in these cells; correspondingly, the introduction of frequent c-myc DSBs robustly promotes Igh-c-myc translocations. Our studies show peripheral B cells that attempt secondary V(D)J recombination, and determine a role for mechanistic factors in promoting recurrent translocations in tumours."

TSPAN12-ADAM10 interaction was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation in multiple tumor cell lines. TSPAN12, to a greater extent than other tet-raspanins (CD81, CD151, CD9, and CD82), associated with ADAM10 but not with ADAM17. Overexpression of TSPAN12 enhanced ADAM10-dependent shedding of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in MCF7 (breast cancer) and SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma) cell lines. Conversely, siRNA ablation of endogenous TSPAN12 mark-edly diminished APP proteolysis in both cell lines. Furthermore, TSPAN12 overexpression enhanced ADAM10 prodomain maturation, whereas TSPAN12 ablation diminished ADAM10 maturation. A palmitoylation-deficient TSPAN12 mutant failed to associate with ADAM10, inhibited ADAM10-dependent proteolysis of APP, and inhibited ADAM10 maturation, most likely by interfering with endogenous wild-type TSPAN12. In conclusion, TSPAN12 serves as a novel and robust partner for ADAM10 and promotes ADAM10 maturation, thereby facilitating ADAM10-dependent proteolysis of APP. This novel mode of regulating APP cleavage is of relevance to Alzheimer's disease therapy.—Xu, D., Sharma, C., Hemler, M. E.

Both groups are found in eubacteria, archebacteria, and eukaryotes. All known plant sequences belong to the EC 1.1.1.27 group (1Cristescu M.E. Innes D.J. Stillman J.H. Crease T.J. BMC Evol.

This system is the main MG catabolic pathway, comprising the enzymes glyoxalase I (lactoylglutathione lyase, EC 4.4.1.5) and glyoxalase II (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase, EC 3.1.2.6). MG (CH3-CO-CHO; see structure in Fig. 4) is a cytotoxic compound formed primarily as a by-product of glycolysis through nonenzymatic phosphate elimination from dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (15Kalapos M.P. Toxicol.

It is assumed that the role of the MG pathway, from MG synthase to d-lactate cytochrome c oxidoreductase in the extant metabolism, is to detoxify MG, whereas in the early state of metabolic development it might function as an anaplerotic route for the tricarboxylic acid cycle (15Kalapos M.P. Toxicol. Lett. 1999; 110: 145-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Glyoxalase I catalyzes the formation of S-d-lactoylglutathione from the hemithioacetal formed nonenzymatically from MG and glutathione, although glyoxalase II catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-d-lactoylglutathione to regenerate glutathione and liberate d-lactate. Glyoxalase I and II activities are present in all tissues of eukaryotic organisms. Glyoxalase I is found in the cytosol, whereas glyoxalase II localizes to the cytosol and mitochondria (13Atlante A. de Bari L. Valenti D. Pizzuto R. Paventi G. Passarella S. Biochim. Biophys.

The complete sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana opened the way to search for genes encoding d-LDHs. Based on similarity with the d-LDH from S. cerevisiae (DLD1), an A. thaliana ortholog was identified. In this study, the isolation and structural and biochemical characterization of the recombinant mature d-LDH from A. thaliana (AtD-LDH) and its paralog, which was found to be a d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (AtD-2HGDH), is described. Whereas AtD-LDH has a narrow substrate specificity and the preferred substrates are d-lactate and d-2-hydroxybutyrate, AtD-2HGDH showed activity exclusively with d-2-hydroxyglutarate. Based on gene coexpression analysis and analysis of corresponding knock-out mutants, the participation of these previously unrecognized mitochondrial activities in plant metabolism is discussed. Total RNA was isolated from 100-mg leaves of 4-week-old plants using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed into first strand cDNA using the SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and used for PCR amplification. To express the mature enzymes, specific primers containing the first codon downstream of the predicted cleavage site were generated. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce a BamHI site both at the 5′ and at the 3′ end of the fragment. The primers used for the amplification were as follows: AtD-LDH-F (5′-GGATCCGGCGATAGCTGCCTCCG-3′) and AtD-LDH-R (5′-GGATCCTTAGAAACATACATGAGGAGGAATTAAC-3) and AtD-2HGDH-F (5′-GGATCCGGTGTCAGGCTTTGTG-3) and AtD-2HGDH-R (5′-GGATCCTTAGTTGGAGAAGAGAGAGTGAGG-3). First-strand synthesis products were amplified by PCR using the PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1.5 min followed by 37 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 64 °C for 40 s, elongation at 72 °C for 2 min, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO (Invitrogen) and the generated plasmid, called pTopoBluntAtD-LDH and pTopoBluntAtD-2HGDH, was sequenced using the PRISM fluorescent dye-terminator system (Applied Biosystems). The inserts were cut out with BamHI and ligated into a BamHI linearized pET16b vector (Novagen). The resulting expression vectors designated as pET16b-AtD-LDH and pET16b-AtD-2HGDH were transformed into the BLR DE3 pLysS Escherichia coli strain (Novagen). The vectors pET16b-AtD-LDH and pET16b-AtD-2HGDH generate fusion proteins with an N-terminal His tag facilitating the purification of the recombinant proteins. The BLR cells transformed with the vectors were grown in LB medium at 37 °C and agitation at 220 rpm in the presence of 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 5 μg/ml tetracycline until the culture reached an A600 nm of 0.6. To induce the expression of AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH, 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture, and the bacteria were allowed to grow for another hour. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 35 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant was used for protein purification using immobilized metal ion chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Ni2+-NTA, Qiagen). The column was equilibrated and washed with 100 mm Na2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted using 3 ml of 100 mm Na2PO4 (pH 7.2) and 250 mm imidazole. The yield of the expressed proteins (greater than 95% pure) was about 2 mg/liter E. coli culture. The purified enzymes were used immediately for the kinetic measurements or, alternatively, concentrated using Centricon YM-30 (Amicon) and incubated with protease factor Xa (1:100 v/v) at 10 °C for 2 h to remove the N terminus encoded by the expression vector (20 amino acid residues). The proteins were further purified using a Ni2+-NTA column to eliminate the cleaved fusion peptide. The eluted proteins were used immediately for kinetic measurements. The pH dependence of the AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH activities was determined spectrophotometrically using a reaction mixture containing 50 mm K2PO4 (pH 6.0–9.5) and 200 μm cytochrome c or, alternatively, 3 mm phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and 200 μm 2,6 dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) in a final volume of 0.2 ml. In the case of AtD-LDH, 10 mm of either glycolate or sodium d-lactate and for AtD-2HGDH 10 mm Na-d-2-hydroxyglutarate (d-2HG) were used as substrates. Activities were measured at 25 °C by recording the reduction of DCIP at 600 nm (ϵ, 22 cm−1 mm−1) or, alternatively, cytochrome c at 550 nm (ϵ, 18.6 cm−1 mm−1). When assaying with cytochrome c, the resulting absorption was divided by 2 because 2 mol of cytochrome c are reduced for each mole of substrate oxidized. A base line was determined by monitoring the reaction mix for 4 min before the addition of purified enzyme (0.2–40 μg, depending on the substrate used). The substrate specificity of the enzymes was assayed using 10 mm substrate (see TABLE 2, TABLE 3) at pH 8.75 and cytochrome c or PMS and DCIP as electron acceptors as described above. The Km and Vmax values for the best substrates were determined at pH 8.75 with cytochrome c or PMS and DCIP and varying the concentration of the substrate while keeping the concentrations of the other components constant. All constants were calculated with at least two different enzyme batches each containing at least triplicate determinations and adjusted to nonlinear regression (SigmaPlot). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount that oxidizes 1 μmol of substrate/min. This corresponds to the reduction of 2 μmol of cytochrome c or 1 μmol of DCIP. The oxidation of glycolate, d- and l-lactate, and d-2HG by NAD or NADP (1 mm) as well as the reduction of glyoxylate, pyruvate, and 2-ketoglutarate by NADH or NADPH (1 mm) was measured at 340 nm (ϵ, 6.22 cm−1 mm−1) as described above. The possible oxidase activity on glycolate using O2 was measured as described previously (21Fahnenstich H. Scarpeci T.E. Valle E.M. Flügge U.I. Maurino V.G. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the recombinant proteins were estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The column was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and calibrated using molecular mass standards. The samples and the standards were applied separately in a final volume of 10 μl at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorption spectra of AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH were measured with a Hach DR 5000 UV-visible spectrophotometer in 2 nm steps. The cofactors were released from the recombinant purified proteins (0.7 mg) by heating at 95 °C for 15 min, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatants (20 μl), riboflavin (2 μl, 2 mm), FMN (2 μl, 2 mm), and FAD (2 μl, 2 mm) were spotted on cellulose 300 thin layer chromatography plates and run in the dark with buffer A consisting of 5% Na2HPO4 in aqueous solution or, alternatively, with buffer B consisting of 1-butanol:HAc:water (4:1:5). Sample positions were subsequently detected under UV light. The same samples were analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel (0.75 m Tris (pH 8.45)) consisting of an 8% T, 3% C stacking gel and an 18% T, 6.1% C separation gel. The gel was run at 100 V in darkness using as anode buffer 0.2 m Tris (pH 8.9) and as cathode buffer 0.1 m Tris and 0.1 m Tricine (pH 8.25). Seeds of tDNA insertion lines Salk_001490 (dldh1-1), Salk_026859 (dldh1-2), Salk_061383 (d2hgdh1-1), and Sail_844_G06 (d2hgdh1-2) were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center. Homozygous plants were isolated by two sets of PCRs. The first PCR was performed using the gene-specific primers d-LDH1–1-F (5′-ATAAGAAAAGAGGCGCTGTGG-3′) and d-LDH1–1-R (5′-TTAGAAACATACATGAGGAGGAATTAACTTTCCC-3′) for dldh1-1, or d-LDH1–2-F (5′-ATGGCTTTCGCTTCAAAATTC-3′) and d-LDH1–2-R (5′-GTAGCACACATGCCTCCTATGG-3′) for dldh1-2, or d-2HGDH1–1-F (5′-CGAGACAACAGGGAGTGATG-3′) and d-2HGDH1–1-R (5′-GTTGGAGAAGAGAGAGTGAGGAAG-3′) for d2hgdh1-1, or d-2HGDH1–2-F (CTTTGTTTGGATTGCGATGA) and d-2HGDH1–2-R (CATTGTACAAGCACAAGCCAAT) for d2hgdh1-2. The second PCR was carried out with the tDNA left border primer SALK-LB (5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC-3′) in combination with d-LDH1–1-F, d-LDH1–2-R, or d-2HGDH-R using the lines dldh1-1, dldh1-2, and d2hgdh1-1, respectively. In the case of line d2hgdh1-2, the second PCR was carried out using the tDNA left border primer Sail-LB (5′-TAGCATCTGAATTTCATAACCAATCTCGATACAC-3′) and d-2HGDH1–2-R. A. thaliana wild type (Columbia-0) and the tDNA insertion lines were grown in pots containing 3 parts soil (Gebr. Patzer KG, Sinntal-Jossa) and 1 part vermiculite (Basalt Feuerfest, Linz) in a growth cabinet at a 16:8 h light:dark cycle at 22 °C day and 18 °C night temperatures and at a photosynthetically active photon flux density of 100 μmol quanta m−2 s−1. Alternatively, plants were grown in liquid medium containing 4.6 g/liter Murashige and Skoog (MS) and 3% sucrose at pH 5.6 in the dark at 28 °C and constant agitation. Growth of plants in the presence of different concentrations of l-lactate, MG, and glycolate was conducted on ½ MS agar plates in a growth cabinet as described above. To determine the expression of both homologous genes in the insertion mutants, total RNA was isolated from 100 mg of leaves using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was converted into first strand cDNA using the SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCRs were conducted in a final volume of 10 μl using 1 μl of the transcribed product and TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). The pairs of primers used were d-LDH1–1-F and d-LDH1–1-R for dldh1-1 and dldh1-2 or d-2HGDH-F and d-2HGDH-R for d2hgdh1-1 and d2hgdh1-2. Amplification conditions were as follows: 1.5 min of denaturation at 95 °C; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 5 min at 72 °C. As control, the actin2 gene was amplified by 28 cycles using the following primers: Actin2-F (5′-TAACTCTCCCGCTATGTATGTCGC-3′) and Actin2-R (5′-CCACTGAGCACAATGTTACCGTAC-3′). Leaves from 3-week-old soil-grown plants and roots from liquid culture-grown plants (500 mg) from wild type and the tDNA insertion lines were ground in liquid N2 in the presence of 500 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min and subjected to native PAGE. Mitochondria isolation and intactness of the preparations were essentially as described by Keech et al. (22Keech O. Dizengremel P. Gardeström P. Physiol. Plant. 2005; 124: 403-409Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Purity of the mitochondrial preparations was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies raised against the cytosolic malate dehydrogenase from Ananas comosus, which react with the cytosolic and chloroplastic isoforms but not with the mitochondrial one (donated by Florencio Podestá, University of Rosario). Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Denaturing SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting. For Western blots, the membrane was incubated with anti-His antibodies (1:10; Qiagen). Bound antibodies were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Native PAGE was performed employing an 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was run at 100 V and 4 °C. Gels were assayed for activity by incubation in the dark at 30 °C with 50 mm K2PO4 (pH 8.75), 5 mm substrate, 0.05% (w/v) nitro blue tetrazolium, and 150 μm PMS in a final volume of 5 ml. Genes that are coexpressed with At5g06580 and At4g36400 were identified using the ATTED-II data base (25Obayashi T. Hayashi S. Saeki M. Ohta H. Kinoshita K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D987-D991Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and summarized in supplemental Table 1. The Mutual Rank, which is based on weighted Pearson correlation coefficients, is used to assess the extent of gene coexpression. The Mutual Rank is calculated as the geometric mean of the correlation rank of gene A to gene B and of gene B to gene A. The Gene Ontology annotations were manually actualized and corrected. To identify candidate genes encoding d-LDH enzymes, the A. thaliana genome was searched with the S. cerevisiae d-LDH (ScD-LDH or DLD1, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number P32891) protein sequence, using the BLAST search algorithm. The top hit was a polypeptide of 567 amino acids (62.2 kDa) encoded by locus At5g06580. This protein contains a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence (26Schwacke R. Schneider A. van der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). A subsequent BLAST search in the A. thaliana genome using the At5g06580 translated sequence yielded a second protein with 24% identity. This 559-amino acid protein (61.4 kDa) was also predicted to localize to mitochondria (26Schwacke R. Schneider A. van der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and is encoded by locus At4g36400. A phylogenetic tree generated using a multiple sequence alignment of orthologous sequences of At5g06580 and At4g36400 showed two well resolved groups, which include At5g06580 (Fig. 1A) or At4g36400 (Fig. 1B), respectively. Interestingly, plants, mammalia, and fungi always possess both sequences, each belonging to one of the two groups (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis clearly shows that plant, mammalian, and fungi proteins group into different clusters (Figs. 1A and 2A). The retention of both enzymes in all higher organisms investigated indicates that these proteins may have universal roles in metabolism. The only two characterized proteins orthologous to At5g06580, S. cerevisiae DLD1 (supplemental Fig. S1A) and K. lactis DLD1, show d-LDH activity (8Lodi T. Ferrero I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 238: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Horikiri S. Aizawa Y. Kai T. Amachi S. Shinoyama H. Fujii T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27Gregolin C. Singer T.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 201-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, At5g06580 was designated as AtD-LDH. Bacterial d-LDHs resemble the proteins of the At5g06580 group, but the sequences are less conserved (9Reed D.W. Hartzell P.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7580-7587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sun Z.Y. Dowd S.R. Felix C. Hyde J.S. Ho C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). On the other hand, four proteins orthologous to At4g36400 have been described previously. The enzymes from Homo sapiens (supplemental Fig. S1B) and Mus musculus display d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (d-2HGDH) activity (29Achouri Y. Noël G. Vertommen D. Rider M.H. Veiga-Da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas the proteins from S. cerevisiae (ScDLD2 (supplemental Fig. S1B) and ScDLD3) have d-LDH activity (30Chelstowska A. Liu Z. Jia Y. Amberg D. Butow R.A. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1377-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, ScDLD2 and ScDLD3 have not been tested with d-2HG, and thus, previous investigations could not exclude that this could be a substrate for these enzymes. At4g36400 was therefore designated as AtD-2HGDH. Analysis of the N-terminal region of AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH predicted the existence of mitochondrial targeting sequences of 56 and 33 amino acid residues in length (26Schwacke R. Schneider A. van der Graaff E. Fischer K. Catoni E. Desimone M. Frommer W.B. Flügge U.I. Kunze R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 16-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). With the aim of determining the catalytic properties of the mature proteins (starting at amino acid residues 57 and 34, respectively, see supplemental Fig. S1, A and B), the truncated AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH cDNAs were cloned in the pET-16b expression vector and expressed in E. coli. Polypeptides of ∼61.0 and 63.0 kDa (59.0 and 60.7 kDa corresponding to AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH mature protein sequences, respectively, plus a 2.4-kDa N-terminal sequence encoded by the vector, including the His-10 epitope) were present in the extracts of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells but not in extracts from noninduced cells (Fig. 2, A and B). These proteins were purified to near homogeneity by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography (Fig. 2, A and B) with yields of 0.5–2 mg of protein per liter of E. coli culture. The purified proteins were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against the His tag. SDS-PAGE indicated unique immunoreactive bands with the same molecular masses as obtained by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown), and native PAGE revealed unique immunoreactive bands compatible with the formation of dimers (Fig. 2C). The purified enzymes were rather unstable, and 2 days of storage in a buffer containing 25% glycerol at −20 °C resulted in a 90% loss of activity. The purified AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH were bright yellow, suggesting that a cofactor was associated with the enzymes. The UV-visible absorption spectrum revealed absorption maxima at 375 and 450 nm, which perfectly matches those of the FAD and FMN standards and are well documented as indicators for a flavin cofactor. To determine the identity of the prosthetic group, the enzymes were boiled, and the denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants containing the cofactors were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and by native PAGE using FMN, FAD, and riboflavin as standards. Using both methods, the Rf values of the enzyme cofactors of both enzymes were highly similar to those of FAD (Table 1).TABLE 1RF values of flavins by ascending TLC and PAGEFlavin standardAtD-LDH cofactorAtD-2HGDH cofactorRiboflavinFMNFADTLC A0.380.720.610.580.59TLC B0.450.220.070.070.09PAGE0.090.940.820.800.83 Open table in a new tab Additionally, using the cofactor isolated from 120 μg of boiled AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH in a final volume of 500 μl, the absorption at 450 nm was 0.05. Taking into account that the extinction coefficient of FAD is 11.3 mm−1 cm−1 and the calculated molecular masses of the recombinant AtD-LDH and AtD-2HGDH are 59.0 and 60.7 kDa, respectively, it can be calculated that each mole of monomeric enzyme binds 1 mol of FAD."
https://openalex.org/W2043021563,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood. The identification of critical genes involved in its pathogenesis will be central to advances in our understanding of its molecular basis, and the development of improved therapeutic approaches.We performed a SNP-array based genome-wide copy number analysis in medulloblastoma cell lines, to identify regions of genomic amplification and homozygous deletion, which may harbour critical disease genes. A series of novel and established medulloblastoma defects were detected (MYC amplification (n = 4), 17q21.31 high-level gain (n = 1); 9p21.1-p21.3 (n = 1) and 6q23.1 (n = 1) homozygous deletion). Most notably, a novel recurrent region of genomic amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 was identified (n = 2), and selected for further investigation. Additional analysis by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridisation (iFISH), PCR-based mapping and SNP-array revealed this novel amplification at 8q24.22-q24.23 is independent of MYC amplification at 8q24.21, and is unique to medulloblastoma in over 800 cancer cell lines assessed from different tumour types, suggesting it contains key genes specifically involved in medulloblastoma development. Detailed mapping identified a 3Mb common minimal region of amplification harbouring 3 coding genes (ZFAT1, LOC286094, KHDRBS3) and two genes encoding micro-RNAs (hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d). Of these, only expression of hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 correlated with copy number status, and all three of these transcripts also displayed evidence of elevated expression in sub-sets of primary medulloblastomas, measured relative to the normal cerebellum.These data implicate hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-30d and KHDRBS3 as putative oncogenic target(s) of a novel recurrent medulloblastoma amplicon at 8q24.22-q24.23. Our findings suggest critical roles for these genes in medulloblastoma development, and further support the contribution of micro-RNA species to medulloblastoma pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2050138732,"Concern has been expressed that preventive measures in older people might increase frailty by increasing survival without improving health. We investigated the impact of exercise on the probabilities of health improvement, deterioration and death in community-dwelling older people.In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging, health status was measured by a frailty index based on the number of health deficits. Exercise was classified as either high or low/no exercise, using a validated, self-administered questionnaire. Health status and survival were re-assessed at 5 years. Of 6297 eligible participants, 5555 had complete data. Across all grades of frailty, death rates for both men and women aged over 75 who exercised were similar to their peers aged 65 to 75 who did not exercise. In addition, while all those who exercised had a greater chance of improving their health status, the greatest benefits were in those who were more frail (e.g. improvement or stability was observed in 34% of high exercisers versus 26% of low/no exercisers for those with 2 deficits compared with 40% of high exercisers versus 22% of low/no exercisers for those with 9 deficits at baseline).In community-dwelling older people, exercise attenuated the impact of age on mortality across all grades of frailty. Exercise conferred its greatest benefits to improvements in health status in those who were more frail at baseline. The net effect of exercise should therefore be to improve health status at the population level."
https://openalex.org/W1991568967,"Metabolically active cells require robust mechanisms to combat oxidative stress. The cytoplasmic thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin (Txnrd1/Txn1) system maintains reduced protein dithiols and provides electrons to some cellular reductases, including peroxiredoxins.Here we generated mice in which the txnrd1 gene, encoding Txnrd1, was specifically disrupted in all parenchymal hepatocytes. Txnrd1-deficient livers exhibited a transcriptome response in which 56 mRNAs were induced and 12 were repressed. Based on the global hybridization profile, this represented only 0.3% of the liver transcriptome. Since most liver mRNAs were unaffected, compensatory responses were evidently effective. Nuclear pre-mRNA levels indicated the response was transcriptional. Twenty-one of the induced genes contained known antioxidant response elements (AREs), which are binding sites for the oxidative and chemical stress-induced transcription factor Nrf2. Txnrd1-deficient livers showed increased accumulation of nuclear Nrf2 protein and chromatin immunoprecipitation on the endogenous nqo1 and aox1 promoters in fibroblasts indicated that Txnrd1 ablation triggered in vivo assembly of Nrf2 on each.Chronic deletion of Txnrd1 results in induction of the Nrf2 pathway, which contributes to an effective compensatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2068635330,"SarZ is a global transcriptional regulator that uses a single cysteine residue, Cys(13), to sense peroxide stress and control metabolic switching and virulence in Staphylococcus aureus. SarZ belongs to the single-cysteine class of OhrR-MgrA proteins that play key roles in oxidative resistance and virulence regulation in various bacteria. We present the crystal structures of the reduced form, sulfenic acid form, and mixed disulfide form of SarZ. Both the sulfenic acid and mixed disulfide forms are structurally characterized for the first time for this class of proteins. The Cys(13) sulfenic acid modification is stabilized through two hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues, and the overall DNA-binding conformation is retained. A further reaction of the Cys(13) sulfenic acid with an external thiol leads to formation of a mixed disulfide bond, which results in an allosteric change in the DNA-binding domains, disrupting DNA binding. Thus, the crystal structures of SarZ in three different states provide molecular level pictures delineating the mechanism by which this class of redox active regulators undergoes activation. These structures help to understand redox-mediated virulence regulation in S. aureus and activation of the MarR family proteins in general."

https://openalex.org/W1965585832,"Although glucocorticoids suppress proliferation of many cell types and are used in the treatment of certain cancers, trials of glucocorticoid therapy in breast cancer have been a disappointment. Another suggestion that estrogens may affect glucocorticoid action is that the course of some inflammatory diseases tends to be more severe and less responsive to corticosteroid treatment in females. To date, the molecular mechanism of cross-talk between estrogens and glucocorticoids is poorly understood. Here we show that, in both MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells, estrogen inhibits glucocorticoid induction of the MKP-1 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1) and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase genes. Estrogen did not affect glucocorticoid-induced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation but reduced ligand-induced GR phosphorylation at Ser-211, which is associated with the active form of GR. We show that estrogen increases expression of protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which mediates the dephosphorylation of GR at Ser-211. Gene knockdown of PP5 abolished the estrogen-mediated suppression of GR phosphorylation and induction of MKP-1 and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase. More importantly, after PP5 knockdown estrogen-promoted cell proliferation was significantly suppressed by glucocorticoids. This study demonstrates cross-talk between estrogen-induced PP5 and GR action. It also reveals that PP5 inhibition may antagonize estrogen-promoted events in response to corticosteroid therapy. Although glucocorticoids suppress proliferation of many cell types and are used in the treatment of certain cancers, trials of glucocorticoid therapy in breast cancer have been a disappointment.

We show that estrogen increases expression of protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), which mediates the dephosphorylation of GR at Ser-211. Gene knockdown of PP5 abolished the estrogen-mediated suppression of GR phosphorylation and induction of MKP-1 and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase. More importantly, after PP5 knockdown estrogen-promoted cell proliferation was significantly suppressed by glucocorticoids. This study demonstrates cross-talk between estrogen-induced PP5 and GR action. It also reveals that PP5 inhibition may antagonize estrogen-promoted events in response to corticosteroid therapy. Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality among women. In 2004, 186,772 women were diagnosed with breast cancer and 40,954 women died from breast cancer in United States (1.United States Cancer Statistics Working GroupUnited States Cancer Statistics.

They bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and regulate gene expression by mechanisms similar to ER.

First, MAPK family members p38, JNK, and ERK regulate GR activity differentially. Activation of JNK and ERK inhibits GR transcriptional enhancement, and inhibition of JNK and ERK by inhibitors enhances GR function (19.Wang X. Wu H. Lakdawala V.S. Hu F. Hanson N.D. Miller A.H. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2005; 30: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20.Li L.B. Goleva E. Hall C.F. Ou L.S. Leung D.Y. J. Allergy Clin.

Psychiatry. 2004; 9: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Second, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) phosphorylate GR and regulate its activity. CDK2 phosphorylate rat GR at Ser-224 and Ser-232 (24.Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol.

Ichijo T. Amin N.D. Kesavapany S. Wang Y. Kim N. Rao S. Player A. Zheng Y.L. Garabedian M.J. Kawasaki E. Pant H.C. Chrousos G.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1552-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Third, serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) negatively regulate GR phosphorylation. Inhibition of PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP5 by protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A potentiates GR activity and increases GR phosphorylation (27.Wang Z. Chen W. Kono E. Dang T.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Unlike PP1 and PP2A, PP5 acts predominantly in protein complexes because the N-terminal domain of PP5 folds over the catalytic site blocking access to substrates in the absence of other proteins (29.Swingle M.R.

Barford D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). PP5 has been identified in complexes containing GR and heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) (31.Silverstein A.M.

Glucocorticoids have been used in breast cancer therapy to antagonize the growth-promoting effect of estrogen. Nonetheless, clinical trials of glucocorticoid monotherapy in breast cancer have shown only a modest response (33.Keith B.D. BMC Cancer. 2008; 8: 84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In advanced breast cancer meta-analyses, the addition of glucocorticoids to either chemotherapy or other endocrine therapy has resulted in increased response rates, but not increased survival (33.Keith B.D. BMC Cancer. 2008; 8: 84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34.Ludwig Breast Cancer Study GroupCancer Res. 1985; 45: 4454-4459PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance in breast cancer has not been elucidated but would be important to understand if estrogen-driven corticosteroid resistance is to be circumvented. In this study, we investigated the three GR-regulating pathways discussed above, and we identified PP5 to be involved in the inhibition of GR activity by estrogen providing a novel mechanism of cross-talk between estrogen and glucocorticoids. 17β-Estradiol (E2), dexamethasone (DEX), ICI 182,780, nonimmune rabbit serum, and monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody were purchased from Sigma.

FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was purchased from Roche Applied Science. NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents were purchased from Pierce. SureSilencing shRNA plasmids were purchased from SuperArray Bioscience Corp. (Frederick, MD). ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against PP5 and ON-TARGETplus nontargeting pool siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).

Nonimmune donkey serum was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chemiluminescent reagent was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. For routine proliferation, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium; T47D was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells were cultured in hormone-free medium (phenol red-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped serum) at least 2 days before they were treated with 10 nm E2 and 100 nm DEX for the time length as indicated below. An equal volume of ethanol was used as vehicle control. 6 × 103 MCF-7 cells were plated in flat bottom 96-well plates and cultured in hormone-free medium. Two days later, 10 nm E2 was added. The following day, 100 nm DEX was added alone or in combination with E2, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 2 days. In experiments that examined the effect of PP5 knockdown on MCF-7 cell line proliferation, the cells were transfected with 0.05 μg of SureSilencing shRNA plasmid per well 24 h prior E2 treatment. The number of viable cells was determined with CellQuanti-MTTTM cell viability assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. 105 cells per well were cultured in hormone-free medium in 24-well plates and treated with hormones and inhibitors as indicated. Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After reverse transcription, 500 ng of cDNA from each sample were analyzed by real time PCR using the dual-labeled fluorigenic probe method on an ABI Prism 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The ΔΔCt method was utilized to calculate the relative change in target gene expression as an approximation of transcription based on the change in threshold values for control versus treated cells (the cycle number at which the fluorescent signaling crosses the “threshold” or logarithmic increases in cDNA concentration). This method assumes that both reference gene (internal control, i.e. β-actin used in this study) and target genes have similar amplification efficiencies. GR nuclear translocation and its phosphorylation in response to DEX was analyzed according to Ref. 20.Li L.B. Goleva E. Hall C.F. Ou L.S. Leung D.Y. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2004; 114: 1059-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar with modifications. In brief, 105 MCF-7 cells were cultured on 18-mm round coverslips in 12-well plates. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, permeabilized 15 min in Permeabilization Buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% saponin), and blocked at 37 °C for 1 h in Blocking Buffer (2.25% bovine serum albumin, 45% SuperBlock, 10% nonimmune donkey serum). Total GR and phospho-GR (Ser-211) antibodies were diluted 1:50 in Permeabilization Buffer and incubated with the cells at 4 °C overnight. Corresponding amounts of mouse IgG1 and rabbit IgG were used as negative controls, respectively. The cells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 20 min, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (donkey anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit, diluted 1:500 in Permeabilization Buffer containing 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed again and mounted on slides. All slides were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) with the imaging software Slidebook (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO). Mean fluorescence intensity in the cell nuclei defined by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining was assessed. Fifty to 100 cells were analyzed per slide. Protein samples were resolved on 4–12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated in PBS containing specific antibodies, 5% dry milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, membranes were washed in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG (1:10,000), washed, incubated with chemiluminescent reagent, and processed for autoradiography. 105 MCF-7 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate and cultured in hormone-free medium. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA (or 0.1 μg of shRNA) in 1 ml of medium containing 1 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. Corresponding amounts of control siRNA or shRNA plasmids were used. GR binding to GRE was assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay as described previously (35.Zhang Y. Wang J.S. Chen L.L.

Briefly, 2.5 × 106 cells were used in each precipitation. After sonication, chromatin solution was pre-cleared with 60 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads and 20 μl of nonspecific serum, followed by precipitation with 60 μl of protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads and specific antibody. Precipitated chromatin complexes were removed from the beads through incubation at 65 °C for 30 min with 550 μl of Elution Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). 500 μl of eluates were mixed with 25 μl of 5 m NaCl, 1 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml, DNase-free) and incubated at 65 °C overnight. Samples were then digested with proteinase K, and DNA was purified with QIAquick columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as indicated by the manufacturer, except that the sample was first mixed with PBI buffer (supplied by the manufacturer) for 30 min with agitation (36.Métivier R. Penot G. Hübner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Precipitated DNA was quantified by quantitative real time PCR using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems). Primers used to amplify GRE in SGK gene promoter were as follows: 5′-CTTGTTACCTCCTCACGTG-3′ (forward); 5′-GTCGTCTCTGCACTAAAGG-3′ (reverse). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism, version 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Responses within an experiment were expressed as fold change over the control setting. These data were analyzed by the paired Student's t test, pairing by experiment. Before testing, paired difference distributions were examined for outliers, which can indicate violation to the normality assumption of the t test. No outliers were apparent. Tests were performed only for specific pre-planned treatment comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. A minimum of three independent experiments were conducted to allow for statistical comparisons. In this study, we chose the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line as a model for our experiments. This cell line is known to proliferate in response to estrogen stimulation (37.Urban G. Golden T. Aragon I.V. Scammell J.G. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27638-27646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To study whether glucocorticoids can inhibit estrogen-mediated cell growth, a proliferation assay was carried out. MCF-7 cells were first cultured in hormone-free medium for 2 days to deplete hormones in the cells and then pretreated with 10 nm E2 (the only form of estrogen used in this study) or an equal volume of vehicle (ethanol) for 24 h followed by 100 nm DEX treatment. The purpose of pretreating the cells with estrogen was to mimic the in vivo state, because the breast cancer cells are under estrogen influence before glucocorticoid treatment. Estrogen promoted cell growth by 2.09 ± 0.06-fold as compared with mock control. No change in cell proliferation was noted when cells were cultured in the presence of both estrogen and DEX (1.97 ± 0.04-fold as compared with mock control), indicating that estrogen-promoted cell growth was not inhibited by glucocorticoid treatment. To further explore how estrogen affects the action of glucocorticoids, we assessed the effect of estrogen on DEX induction of MKP-1 and SGK, two well known glucocorticoid-responsive genes (17.Kassel O. Sancono A. Krätzschmar J. Kreft B. Stassen M. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18.Itani O.A. Liu K.Z. Cornish K.L. Campbell J.R. Thomas C.P. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 283: E971-E979Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). DEX alone induced MKP-1 and SGK by 3.23 ± 0.16- and 108.30 ± 9.69-fold, respectively, for 3 h in the MCF-7 cell line. Preincubating MCF-7 cells with estrogen for 24 h prior to DEX treatment significantly inhibited MKP-1 and SGK induction by a mean of 85% (n = 3) and 74% (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 1). Similar estrogen effects were observed in another breast cancer cell line, T47D (Fig. 1). Significantly lower GR expression was found in the T47D cell line as compared with MCF-7 cell line (data not shown). 8 h of stimulation with DEX was determined as an optimal time point for MKP-1 and SGK induction in this cell line. To investigate whether estrogen inhibited DEX induction of MKP-1 and SGK through ER, we employed a selective ER inhibitor ICI 182,780 (inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) = 0.29 nm) to antagonize ER in MCF-7 cells. The results demonstrated that with the presence of 1 μm ICI 182,780, DEX induced both MKP-1 and SGK by 2.37 ± 0.36- and 182.90 ± 38.98-fold, respectively, and the DEX-mediated induction of these genes was no longer inhibited by preincubating the cells with estrogen (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that estrogen exerts its inhibitory effect on glucocorticoid action through the ER. In all experiments using inhibitors, MCF-7 cells were treated in parallel with estrogen and DEX as mentioned above without inhibitors. The results showed that the cells were responding to hormones the same way as described in Fig. 1 (data not shown). In the ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cell line, which expresses only ERβ (38.Im J.Y. Park H. Kang K.W. Choi W.S. Kim H.S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 172: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39.Chen B. Gajdos C. Dardes R. Kidwai N. Johnston S.R. Dowsett M. Jordan V.C. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 327-335PubMed Google Scholar), DEX induction of MKP-1 and SGK was not affected by estrogen (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that estrogen exerts its inhibitory effect on glucocorticoid action through ERα. Because DEX induces gene expression through GR, which accumulates in the nucleus after ligand binding, and Ser-211 phosphorylation is associated with the transcriptionally active form of GR (40.Ismaili N. Garabedian M.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1024: 86-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), we tested GR nuclear translocation and GR phosphorylation at Ser-211 by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3) and Western blot (Fig. 4). DEX alone increased GR nuclear localization with concomitant loss of cytoplasmic GR. This was not affected by preincubation of the cells with estrogen (Fig. 3, A and C). DEX-induced GR phosphorylation at Ser-211 was observed only in the nucleus and was significantly inhibited by estrogen by a mean of 39% (n = 3) (Fig. 3, B and D). Consistent with the immunofluorescence assay results, Western blot of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions showed that estrogen significantly inhibited DEX-mediated Ser-211 GR phosphorylation by a mean of 55% (n = 3) (Fig. 4, A and C) without affecting GR nuclear localization (Fig. 4, A and B). We also tested GR phosphorylation at Ser-226. No phosphorylation at this site was observed in either the absence or presence of glucocorticoid and/or estrogen (data not shown). The other GR phosphorylation sites were not tested because there were no commercially available antibodies.FIGURE 4DEX-induced GR nuclear translocation and its phosphorylation at Ser-211 in MCF-7 cells treated with estrogen as detected by Western blot. A, cells were treated with hormones as described in Fig. 3. Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein samples were prepared using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents and blotted with antibodies against Ser-211-phosphorylated GR. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total GR. Actin and TBP were used as loading controls for cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, respectively. Images are representative of three independent experiments. Fold changes in the densitometry readings of nuclear total GR normalized to TBP (B) and Ser-211-phosphorylated nuclear GR normalized to total GR (C) in the cells treated with DEX alone (set as 1) versus cells cultured with E2 and DEX are provided. NS, not significant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chromatin immunoprecipitation was then performed to test GR binding to a well characterized GRE in the promoter region of the SGK gene (18.Itani O.A.

Steroids. 2008; 73: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Within 1 h, DEX induced GR binding to the GRE by 5.49 ± 0.15-fold, and this was significantly inhibited by estrogen by a mean of 82% (n = 3) (Fig. 5). This result suggests that estrogen inhibits DEX induction of SGK by reducing GR recruitment to the SGK promoter. Because MAPK, CDK, and protein phosphatase can regulate GR activity, we examined the effect of estrogens on these three pathways (19.Wang X. Wu H. Lakdawala V.S. Hu F. Hanson N.D. Miller A.H.

https://openalex.org/W1967049460,"In response to DNA damage, eukaryotic cells activate a series of DNA damage-dependent pathways that serve to arrest cell cycle progression and remove DNA damage. Coordination of cell cycle arrest and damage repair is critical for maintenance of genomic stability. However, this process is still poorly understood. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and the ATR-dependent cell cycle checkpoint are the major pathways responsible for repair of UV-induced DNA damage. Here we show that ATR physically interacts with the NER factor Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XPA). Using a mass spectrometry-based protein footprinting method, we found that ATR interacts with a helix-turn-helix motif in the minimal DNA-binding domain of XPA where an ATR phosphorylation site (serine 196) is located. XPA-deficient cells complemented with XPA containing a point mutation of S196A displayed a reduced repair efficiency of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers as compared with cells complemented with wild-type XPA, although no effect was observed for repair of (6-4) photoproducts. This suggests that the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of XPA may promote NER repair of persistent DNA damage. In addition, a K188A point mutation of XPA that disrupts the ATR-XPA interaction inhibits the nuclear import of XPA after UV irradiation and, thus, significantly reduced DNA repair efficiency. By contrast, the S196A mutation has no effect on XPA nuclear translocation. Taken together, our results suggest that the ATR-XPA interaction mediated by the helix-turn-helix motif of XPA plays an important role in DNA-damage responses to promote cell survival and genomic stability after UV irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W1985989576,"Investigation of the mechanisms of guided cell migration can contribute to our understanding of many crucial biological processes, such as development and regeneration. Endogenous and exogenous direct current electric fields (dcEF) are known to induce directional cell migration, however the initial cellular responses to electrical stimulation are poorly understood. Ion fluxes, besides regulating intracellular homeostasis, have been implicated in many biological events, including regeneration. Therefore understanding intracellular ion kinetics during EF-directed cell migration can provide useful information for development and regeneration.We analyzed the initial events during migration of two osteogenic cell types, rat calvarial and human SaOS-2 cells, exposed to strong (10-15 V/cm) and weak (< or = 5 V/cm) dcEFs. Cell elongation and perpendicular orientation to the EF vector occurred in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. Calvarial osteoblasts migrated to the cathode as they formed new filopodia or lamellipodia and reorganized their cytoskeleton on the cathodal side. SaOS-2 cells showed similar responses except towards the anode. Strong dcEFs triggered a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels, whereas a steady state level of intracellular calcium was observed in weaker fields. Interestingly, we found that dcEF-induced intracellular calcium elevation was initiated with a local rise on opposite sides in calvarial and SaOS-2 cells, which may explain their preferred directionality. In calcium-free conditions, dcEFs induced neither intracellular calcium elevation nor directed migration, indicating an important role for calcium ions. Blocking studies using cadmium chloride revealed that voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are involved in dcEF-induced intracellular calcium elevation.Taken together, these data form a time scale of the morphological and physiological rearrangements underlying EF-guided migration of osteoblast-like cell types and reveal a requirement for calcium in these reactions. We show for the first time here that dcEFs trigger different patterns of intracellular calcium elevation and positional shifting in osteogenic cell types that migrate in opposite directions."
https://openalex.org/W2045734278,"NaBC1 (the SLC4A11 gene) belongs to the SLC4 family of sodium-coupled bicarbonate (carbonate) transporter proteins and functions as an electrogenic sodium borate cotransporter. Mutations in SLC4A11 cause either corneal abnormalities (corneal hereditary dystrophy type 2) or a combined auditory and visual impairment (Harboyan syndrome). The role of NaBC1 in sensory systems is poorly understood, given the difficulty of studying patients with NaBC1 mutations. We report our findings in Slc4a11(-/-) mice generated to investigate the role of NaBC1 in sensorineural systems. In wild-type mice, specific NaBC1 immunoreactivity was detected in fibrocytes of the spiral ligament, from the basal to the apical portion of the cochlea. NaBC1 immunoreactivity was present in the vestibular labyrinth, in stromal cells underneath the non-immunoreactive sensory epithelia of the macula utricle, sacule, and crista ampullaris, and the membranous vestibular labyrinth was collapsed. Both auditory brain response and vestibular evoked potential waveforms were significantly abnormal in Slc4a11(-/-) mice. In the cornea, NaBC1 was highly expressed in the endothelial cell layer with less staining in epithelial cells. However, unlike humans, the corneal phenotype was mild with a normal slit lamp evaluation. Corneal endothelial cells were morphologically normal; however, both the absolute height of the corneal basal epithelial cells and the relative basal epithelial cell/total corneal thickness were significantly increased in Slc4a11(-/-) mice. Our results demonstrate for the first time the importance of NaBC1 in the audio-vestibular system and provide support for the hypothesis that SLC4A11 should be considered a potential candidate gene in patients with isolated sensorineural vestibular hearing abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2066999792,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive phospholipid, induces a wide range of cellular effects, including gene expression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell survival. We have previously shown that LPA stimulates secretion of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in bronchial epithelial cells. This study provides evidence that LPA enhances pulmonary epithelial barrier integrity through protein kinase C (PKC) δ- and ζ-mediated E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. Treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) with LPA increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) by ∼2.0-fold and enhanced accumulation of E-cadherin to the cell-cell junctions through Gαi-coupled LPA receptors. Knockdown of E-cadherin with E-cadherin small interfering RNA or pretreatment with EGTA (0.1 mm) prior to LPA (1 μm) treatment attenuated LPA-induced increases in TER in HBEpCs. Furthermore, LPA induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and overexpression of the FAK inhibitor, and FAK-related non-kinase-attenuated LPA induced increases in TER and E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. Overexpression of dominant negative protein kinase δ and ζ attenuated LPA-induced phosphorylation of FAK, accumulation of E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions, and an increase in TER. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide decreased TER and induced E-cadherin relocalization from cell-cell junctions to cytoplasm in a dose-dependent fashion, which was restored by LPA post-treatment in HBEpCs. Intratracheal post-treatment with LPA (5 μm) reduced LPS-induced neutrophil influx, protein leak, and E-cadherin shedding in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids in a murine model of acute lung injury.

The airway epithelium is the site of first contact for inhaled environmental stimuli, functions as a physical barrier to environmental insult, and is an essential part of innate immunity. Epithelial barrier disruption is caused by inhaled allergens, dust, and irritants, resulting in inflammation, bronchoconstriction, and edema as seen in asthma and other respiratory diseases (1.Budinger G.R.

The epithelial cell-cell junctional complex is composed of tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. These adherens junctions play a pivotal role in regulating the activity of the entire junctional complex because the formation of adherens junctions subsequently leads to the formation of other cell-cell junctions (7.Bush K.T.

Chamber slides were permeabilized for 2 min in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3.7% formaldehyde and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Changes in E-cadherin localization were examined with E-cadherin antibody, and images were examined with a Nikon ECLIPSE TE 300 inverted microscope. Pixel intensities in cell margins were measured with MetaVue software. HBEpCs were grown to confluence on gold microelectrodes. TER was measured in an ECIS (Applied BioPhysics, Foster City, CA). The total electrical resistance measured dynamically across the epithelial monolayer was determined as the combined resistance between the basal surface of the cell and the electrode, reflecting alterations in cell-cell adhesion. HBEpCs (P1 or P2) were cultured onto 6-well plates. At 50–60% confluence, transient transfection of siRNA was carried out using Transmessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Briefly, siRNA (50–100 nm) was condensed with Enhancer R and formulated with Transmessenger reagent, according to the manufacturer's instruction. The transfection complex was diluted into 900 μl of BEBM medium and added directly to the cells. The medium was replaced with complete basal essential growth medium after 3 h. Cells were treated at 72 h after transfection. Infection of HBEpCs (∼60% confluence) with adenoviral empty vector and adenoviral dominant negative PKCδ and -ζ was carried out in 6-well plates. After infection with 20 m.o.i. in 1 ml of basal essential growth medium for 24 h, experiments were performed. HBEpCs grown on gold microelectrodes or 6-well plates (∼60–70% confluence) were transfected with HA-tagged FRNK plasmid (1 μg/ml) using FuGENE HD transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were analyzed after 48 h. HBEpCs were lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates were sonicated on ice for 10 s and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) or concentrated media (20 μl) were subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed at least three times with TBST at 15-min intervals and then incubated with either mouse or rabbit or goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3,000) for 1 h. The membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. All results were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way analysis of variance and, whenever appropriate, analyzed by Student-Newman-Keuls test. Data were expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate samples from at least three independent experiments, and the level of significance was taken to p < 0.05. As pulmonary epithelium provides a physical barrier between underlying tissue and respiratory gases (1.Budinger G.R. Sznajder J.I. Clin.

Biol. 2009; 40: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we utilized ECIS to determine the effect of LPA on pulmonary epithelial barrier function. Exposure of HBEpCs to LPA (0.1–5.0 μm) rapidly induced increases in TER by ∼2.0-fold over the control value (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting LPA-mediated enhancement of epithelial barrier integrity. LPA (1 μm) also induced the increases in TER in HSAEpCs and MLE12 cells (data not shown). These results show that LPA-mediated increases in TER are very similar, if not identical, in all three cell types, and further experiments with LPA were carried out with HBEpCs. To determine the effect of LPA with varying acyl chain lengths on epithelial barrier function, HBEpCs were challenged with 1 μm of 16:0, 18:0, and 18:1 LPA. All three LPAs induced increases in TER; the magnitude of effect on increasing TER was 18:1LPA ≥ 18:0LPA > 16:0LPA (Fig. 1C). The expression of LPA receptors (LPA1–5) in HBEpCs was examined by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Table 1, the relative abundance of mRNA detected was LPA1 > LPA3 > LPA2 >LPA4, whereas LPA5 was not detectable in HBEpCs. We have shown that transfection of HBEpCs with LPA1–3 siRNA down-regulated expression of LPA1–3 and attenuated LPA-induced IL-8 secretion (37.Saatian B. Zhao Y. He D. Georas S.N. Watkins T. Spannhake E.W. Natarajan V. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using a similar approach, HBEpCs were transfected with scrambled siRNA, LPA1-, LPA2-, or LPA3-specific siRNA and then challenged with LPA (1 μm). Fig. 1D shows that down-regulation of LPA1 and LPA3 by transfection of LPA1 and LPA3 siRNA-attenuated LPA (100 nm, 72 h) induced the increases in TER around 53 and 64%, respectively; however, down-regulation of LPA2 expression had no effect on LPA-induced increases in TER. Pretreatment with LPA1,3-specific antagonist, Ki16425 (0.1, 1.0, and 10 μm), attenuated LPA (1 μm) induced the increases in TER in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, pretreatment with a specific Gαi inhibitor, pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 4 h) attenuated LPA, induced the increases in TER (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that LPA induces pulmonary epithelial barrier enhancement, in part, through LPA-R1,3 coupled to Gαi.TABLE 1Expression of LPA receptors in HBEpCsHuman LPA receptorsLPA1LPA2LPA3LPA4LPA5Normalized to 18 S145.1 ± 47.714.3 ± 1.751.0 ± 14.01.2 ± 0.10.1 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab We previously demonstrated that LPA induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions in 1 h (45.Zhao Y. He D. Stern R. Usatyuk P.V. Spannhake E.W. Salgia R. Natarajan V. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2329-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To further determine the effect of LPA on E-cadherin redistribution, HBEpCs were challenged with LPA (0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 μm) for 15 min, and E-cadherin localization was determined with an antibody specificity to the extracellular domain of E-cadherin. As shown in Fig. 2A, LPA-induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions was dose-dependent. However, the effect of LPA was maintained up to 6 h and reduced at 24 h (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, LPA (1 μm, 15 min) induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions in both HSAEpCs and MLE12 (data not shown). Next we determined which LPA receptor isotype(s) was involved in LPA-induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. HBEpCs were incubated with Ki16425 (5 μm) for 1 h and then challenged with LPA (1 μm, 15 min). As shown in Fig. 2C, Ki16425 partly attenuated LPA-induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. These results suggest that LPA1 and LPA3 are involved in LPA-induced E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions in pulmonary epithelial cells. The mechanism(s) of LPA-mediated enhanced epithelial barrier integrity has yet to be fully defined. To determine whether LPA-induced enhancement of TER is dependent on E-cadherin accumulation to cell-cell junctions, HBEpCs were transfected with E-cadherin siRNA (100 nm, 72 h) prior to LPA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, E-cadherin siRNA attenuated LPA-induced increases in TER. The specificity of E-cadherin siRNA was confirmed by Western blotting with antibody to E-cadherin. E-cadherin siRNA transfection decreased E-cadherin expression, without altering c-Met expression (Fig. 3B). To further understand the mechanism of regulation of TER by LPA via E-cadherin, we adopted a well established technique to study E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions by disruption of Ca2+-dependent E-cadherin-mediated adhesion with EGTA (46.Collares-Buzato C.B. McEwan G.T. Jepson M.A. Simmons N.L. Hirst B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HBEpCs were pretreated with EGTA (0.1 mm) for 30 min and then challenged with LPA (1 μm), and TER was measured by the ECIS system. As shown in Fig. 3C, LPA increased TER, and pretreatment with EGTA attenuated LPA-induced TER (from ∼1.7- to ∼1.3-fold). These data suggest that the LPA-induced increase in TER is via Ca2+-dependent E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Human bronchial epithelial cells express PKC isoforms PKCα, PKCδ, PKCζ, and PKCλ (31.Cummings R. Zhao Y. Jacoby D. Spannhake E.W. Ohba M. Garcia J.G. Watkins T. He D. Saatian B. Natarajan V. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2072993274,"Antigen binding to the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) initiates an array of signaling events. These include endocytosis of ligand-receptor complexes via clathrin-coated pits, trafficking of the internalized ligand to lysosomes, degradation of the associated proteins to peptides, and peptide presentation on nascent major histocompatibility complex class II to T cells. The signal transduction events supporting BCR internalization are not well understood. We have identified a pathway supporting BCR internalization that includes the Vav1 and/or Vav3 isoforms and the GTPase dynamin. Vav1 and -3 are not required for B cell development and maturation, nor for a variety of BCR-induced signaling events nor for BCR signaling leading to major histocompatibility complex class II and CD80 expression, but Vav1 and/or -3 are absolutely required for BCR endocytosis and BCR-induced Rac-GTP loading. This is the first demonstration of a link between Vav and Rac in BCR internalization leading to antigen presentation to T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2133066387,"PSTPIP1 is a cytoskeleton-associated adaptor protein that links PEST-type phosphatases to their substrates. Mutations in PSTPIP1 cause PAPA syndrome (Pyogenic sterile Arthritis, Pyoderma gangrenosum, and Acne), an autoinflammatory disease. PSTPIP1 binds to pyrin and mutations in pyrin result in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), a related autoinflammatory disorder. Since disease-associated mutations in PSTPIP1 enhance pyrin binding, PAPA syndrome and FMF are thought to share a common pathoetiology. The studies outlined here describe several new aspects of PSTPIP1 and pyrin biology. We document that PSTPIP1, which has homology to membrane-deforming BAR proteins, forms homodimers and generates membrane-associated filaments in native and transfected cells. An extended FCH (Fes-Cip4 homology) domain in PSTPIP1 is necessary and sufficient for its self-aggregation. We further show that the PSTPIP1 filament network is dependent upon an intact tubulin cytoskeleton and that the distribution of this network can be modulated by pyrin, indicating that this is a dynamic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that pyrin can recruit PSTPIP1 into aggregations (specks) of ASC, another pyrin binding protein. ASC specks are associated with inflammasome activity. PSTPIP1 molecules with PAPA-associated mutations are recruited by pyrin to ASC specks with particularly high efficiency, suggesting a unique mechanism underlying the robust inflammatory phenotype of PAPA syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2019954466,"Background The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of L-Dopa medication in Parkinson's disease (PD) on brain activation during the performance of a set-shifting task. Using fMRI, we have previously studied the patterns of activity observed in patients with PD after overnight removal of dopaminergic medication compared with control participants during the performance of different stages of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). The results revealed decreased cortical activity in the PD group compared to controls in the conditions that significantly required striatum, while increased cortical activity was observed when striatum was not involved. However, the effect of dopaminergic medication in PD patients on those patterns of activity has not yet been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, eleven PD patients at early stage of the disease taking L-Dopa medication were recruited and underwent two fMRI sessions while performing the WCST: one session while taking their normal dose of medication and the other following overnight dopaminergic medication withdrawal. We found that L-dopa medication helped restoring a normal pattern of activity when matching and not planning was required, by increasing cortical activity in the premotor cortex. This effect was even stronger in the motor loop, i.e. when the putamen was required for controls, when matching following negative feedback. However, the medication did not change the pattern of activity in conditions relying primarily on a cognitive loop, i.e. when the caudate nucleus was required. Conclusions/Significance These studies provide explanation at the neural level regarding the relatively poor effects of L-Dopa on the cognitive deficits observed in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2098354558,"The Hsp-organizing protein (HOP) binds to the C termini of the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90, thus bringing them together so that substrate proteins can be passed from Hsp70 to Hsp90. Because Hsp90 is essential for the correct folding and maturation of many oncogenic proteins, it has become a significant target for anti-cancer drug design. HOP binds to Hsp70 and Hsp90 via two independent tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains, TPR1 and TPR2A, respectively. We have analyzed ligand binding using Poisson-Boltzmann continuum electrostatic calculations, free energy perturbation, molecular dynamics simulations, and site-directed mutagenesis to delineate the contribution of different interactions to the affinity and specificity of the TPR-peptide interactions. We found that continuum electrostatic calculations could be used to guide protein design by removing unfavorable interactions to increase binding affinity, with an 80-fold increase in affinity for TPR2A. Contributions at buried charged residues, however, were better predicted by free energy perturbation calculations. We suggest using a combination of the two approaches for increasing the accuracy of results, with free energy perturbation calculations used only at selected buried residues of the ligand binding pocket. Finally we present the crystal structure of TPR2A in complex with its non-cognate Hsp70 ligand, which provides insight on the origins of specificity in TPR domain-peptide recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2116391378,"The reduction of nitrite (NO2−) into nitric oxide (NO), catalyzed by nitrite reductase, is an important reaction in the denitrification pathway. In this study, the catalytic mechanism of the copper-containing nitrite reductase from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxNiR) has been studied using single and multiple turnover experiments at pH 7.0 and is shown to involve two protons. A novel steady-state assay was developed, in which deoxyhemoglobin was employed as an NO scavenger. A moderate solvent kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) of 1.3 ± 0.1 indicated the involvement of one protonation to the rate-limiting catalytic step. Laser photoexcitation experiments have been used to obtain single turnover data in H2O and D2O, which report on steps kinetically linked to inter-copper electron transfer (ET). In the absence of nitrite, a normal SKIE of ∼1.33 ± 0.05 was obtained, suggesting a protonation event that is kinetically linked to ET in substrate-free AxNiR. A nitrite titration gave a normal hyperbolic behavior for the deuterated sample. However, in H2O an unusual decrease in rate was observed at low nitrite concentrations followed by a subsequent acceleration in rate at nitrite concentrations of >10 mm. As a consequence, the observed ET process was faster in D2O than in H2O above 0.1 mm nitrite, resulting in an inverted SKIE, which featured a significant dependence on the substrate concentration with a minimum value of ∼0.61 ± 0.02 between 3 and 10 mm.

The T1Cu, which is responsible for the color of NiR, serves as the electron delivery center and is coordinated by two histidine residues as well as one cysteine and one methionine residue. The catalytic T2Cu, which like all T2Cu centers has very weak optical bands, is ligated to three His residues and an H2O/OH− ligand in the resting state. This H2O/OH− ligand is held in place by hydrogen bonds to the active site residues, Asp-92 (AxNiR numbering) and His-249, and gets displaced by the substrate during catalytic turnover (14Strange R.W.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)), implying a thermodynamically equal electron distribution between the two metal centers. From an enzymatic point of view, however, approaching this equilibrium position on such a fast time scale (≥150 s−1) is unfavorable in the absence of substrate, as NiR has been shown to form an inactive species with a reduced T2Cu that is devoid of the H2O/OH− ligand and unable to bind nitrite (26Wijma H.J.

Substrate binding has been proposed to induce a favorable shift in the T2Cu redox potential, which would be expected to result in an accelerated ET compared with the substrate-free reaction (7Suzuki S.

However, kET(obs) values in AxgNiR (GIFU1051) have been demonstrated to be lower in the nitrite-bound than in the substrate-free enzyme between pH 7.7 and 5.5 (21Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Deligeer Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Below pH 5.5, the ET rate constants were observed to be similar in the nitrite-free and -bound enzyme (21Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Deligeer Suzuki S. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to changes in the redox potentials and thus in the driving force of the ET reaction, several structural changes in the redox centers have been reported as a result of substrate binding, which may also influence the inter-copper ET rate by changing the reorganization energy (16Yousafzai F.K.

These rearrangements include subtle changes in the Cys-His bridge linking T1- and T2Cu (32Kohzuma T. Kikuchi M. Horikoshi N. Nagatomo S. Kitagawa T. Czernuszewicz R.S. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 45: 8474-8476Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and conformational transitions of the catalytically relevant active site residue Asp-92 (see below and Ref. 29Hough M.A. Ellis M.J. Antonyuk S. Strange R.W. Sawers G. Eady R.R. Samar Hasnain S. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of nitrite has been postulated to be relayed to the T1Cu site via the so-called substrate sensor loop (via His-94, Asp-92, and His-89 in AxNiR), thereby triggering ET to the T2Cu (19Farver O.

The tight coupling of ET to the presence of substrate has been argued to prevent the formation of a deactivated enzyme species with a prematurely reduced T2Cu (14Strange R.W. Dodd F.E. Abraham Z.H.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3430-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In accordance with such a feedback mechanism, in a combined crystallographic and single-crystal spectroscopic study, inter-copper ET could only be detected in crystals where nitrite was bound to the T2Cu site, whereas in the absence of substrate no such ET was observed (34Hough M.A. Antonyuk S.V. Strange R.W. Eady R.R. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This finding, however, contradicts the pulse radiolysis results at room temperature (see above), and the apparent discrepancy between solution studies and x-ray crystallographic data collected at cryogenic temperature remains to be resolved. The one-electron reduction of nitrite to NO involves two protons according to the chemical net equation NO2− + 2H+ + e− → NO + H2O, if the T2Cu is ligated by an H2O molecule in the resting state rather than an OH− ion. Although the exact enzymatic mechanism is still somewhat controversial (35De Marothy S.A. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. J. Comput. Chem. 2007; 28: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Sundararajan M. Hillier I.H. Burton N.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2007; 111: 5511-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), one suggested reaction sequence is given in Scheme 1. The potential participation of active site residues in catalyzing the proton transfer (PT) steps has been investigated by studying the pH dependence of NiR under steady-state conditions as well as by pulse radiolysis. The trends obtained for kcat and kET(obs), are similar with pH optima between 5.2 and 6, indicating the involvement of two amino acid residues (21Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Deligeer Suzuki S. J.

The relevance of these active site residues, however, as well as the timing of the two protonation steps is still a matter of debate (35De Marothy S.A. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. J. Comput.

There are no experimental studies that have been aimed at directly examining the kinetic coupling of PT and ET steps in AxNiR. In this study of the blue AxNiR, our aims were to gain further insight into the mechanism of nitrite reduction by combining multiple turnover experiments with laser photoexcitation studies to measure the (single turnover) inter-copper ET. An extensive analysis of the solvent kinetic isotope effect (SKIE) has been employed as a means of determining whether solvent-exchangeable protons and/or water molecules play a rate-limiting role in the catalytic turnover and/or in inter-copper ET. NADH was purchased from Melford Laboratories (Suffolk, UK). Luria-Bertani medium was from ForMedium (Norfolk, UK). NaCl, KCl, Tris, di-potassium hydrogen phosphate, and potassium di-hydrogen phosphate were from Fisher. D2O was from Goss Scientific Instruments Ltd. (Essex, UK). Kanamycin, isopropyl thiogalactoside, KNO2, CuSO4, DNase, lysozyme, MES, dithionite, phenol red (PR), ascorbate, phenazine methosulfate (PMS), bovine methemoglobin. and N-methylnicotinamide (NMN) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant NiR from A. xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans (NCIMB 11015, AxNiR) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the purification was similar to the method described previously (42Harris R.L.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2323-2329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see supplemental material for detailed description). AxNiR concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of ϵ595 = 6.3 mm−1 cm−1 (9Dodd F.E. Van Beeumen J. Eady R.R. Hasnain S.S. J. Mol.

Biol. 2002; 316: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The AxNiR enzyme lacking the copper atom in the T2Cu center (T2DNiR) was expressed and purified in the same way as AxNiR except that the dialysis steps into CuSO4 were omitted (27Strange R.W.

J. 1993; 295: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted in a Belle Technology glovebox under a nitrogen atmosphere except for the laser photoexcitation measurements, for which samples were prepared in the glovebox, transferred into rubber-sealed quartz cuvettes, and taken out of the box. Buffers were made anaerobic by bubbling with nitrogen for at least 20 min and transferred into the glovebox; the bottles were then left open overnight to achieve complete equilibration with the anaerobic atmosphere. Oxygen levels were kept below 5 ppm throughout the experiment. Enzyme solutions were made oxygen-free by passing through a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with the anaerobic buffer. Multiple turnover experiments using the pH indicator PR were performed in unbuffered solution (110 mm KCl, distilled H2O) with an ionic strength equivalent to 50 mm potassium phosphate (KPi), pH 7.0. The reaction was observed in a Cary UV-50 Bio UV-visible scanning spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) using a 1-mm path length cuvette to allow the use of higher dye concentrations. The initial PR spectrum was adjusted to match the spectrum obtained in buffered solution at pH 7.0 (AU432/AU556 ≅ 2). The [H+]-dependent absorbance change of the PR spectrum was used to monitor the protons being taken up during the turnover of AxNiR with its natural substrate nitrite (NO2−). The reductant ascorbate in combination with the mediator PMS served as an artificial electron donor system. The sample mixture included 1 μm AxNiR, KNO2 concentrations between 25 and 160 μm, 300 μm PR, 10 μm PMS, and 1 mm ascorbate. Progress curves were recorded until the thermodynamic equilibrium of the enzymatic reaction was reached and were then corrected for the background reaction of the electron donor with the substrate observed in the absence of enzyme. Proton calibration curves were obtained by titrating incomplete sample mixtures with defined amounts of hydroxide ions. Three standard curves were produced using 300 μm PR only, 300 μm PR + 1 μm AxNiR, and the complete sample except the substrate. The average curve was used to determine the changes in proton concentration upon multiple turnover of AxNiR. The steady state activity of AxNiR was determined in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0 (100% H2O), and 50 mm KPi, pH 6.59 (100% D2O), at 4 °C using deoxyhemoglobin (deoxyHb) as an NO scavenger and observing the spectral changes upon binding of NO to deoxyHb. Bovine hemoglobin was purchased as methemoglobin, reduced by dithionite (DT) in the glovebox, and made anaerobic by passing through a PD-10 column, yielding deoxyhemoglobin. Hb concentrations were determined aerobically using an extinction coefficient for oxyHb of ϵ414 = 131 mm−1 cm−1 per monomer (45Burkhard O. Barnikol W.K. J. Appl. Physiol. 1982; 52: 124-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of AxNiR were measured anaerobically at 430 nm using an Applied Photophysics SC18MV stopped-flow instrument with a 2-mm path length. 30 μm heme (7.5 μm deoxyHb, 15 μm heme after mixing), 10 mm ascorbate (5 mm after mixing), and 100 μm PMS (50 μm after mixing; E′0 = +92 mV (27Strange R.W.

The ionic strength was adjusted to ([KNO2] + [KCl])after mixing = 50 mm. Progress curves of nitrite reduction by AxNiR were recorded by measuring the absorbance change at 430 nm associated with NO binding to heme. To calculate the steady state activity of AxNiR, initial rates were determined from the slopes of the progress curves using less than 20% of the decreasing ΔAU430. The slopes (ΔAU430·s−1) were corrected for the ΔAU430 resulting from the background nitrite reductase activity of deoxyHb. These values were converted into units of micromolars NO·s−1 by dividing through a calibration factor of 0.0232 ΔAU430·μm−1 obtained in a calibration experiment using limiting KNO2 concentrations. To check the validity of the Hb-linked assay, the results were compared with a continuous spectrophotometric assay using DT as reductant and following its depletion at 315 nm (ϵ315 = 8 mm−1 cm−1 (37Abraham Z.H. Smith B.E. Howes B.D. Lowe D.J. Eady R.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar)). This assay was also conducted in the stopped-flow using 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0 (100% H2O), at 4 °C, and an ionic strength of [KNO2] + [KCl] after mixing = 50 mm. As described for the Hb assay, 2 mm DT and 100 μm PMS were mixed with varying KNO2 concentrations and three different AxNiR concentrations for each KNO2 concentration yielding steady-state rates for AxNiR. Sample solutions with a volume of 750 μl were prepared in a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette and sealed “air-tight” inside the glovebox. Samples contained 30 μm AxNiR, 200 μm NADH as electron donor, 50 mm NMN as mediator, and varying KNO2 concentrations. The standard buffer system was 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. For proton inventory and SKIE experiments, the pH value was determined using a conventional pH-meter, and the pH reading (pH(obs)) was corrected using (47Schowen K.B. Schowen R.L. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 551-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1, pHobs=pHdesired−(ΔpH)n=pD−(ΔpH)n=pD−(0.076⋅n2+0.3314⋅n)(Eq. 1) where (ΔpH)n is a correction factor depending on the volume fraction of D2O (n), i.e. n = 1 for pure D2O. Proton inventory experiments, in which the amount of D2O was varied from 0 to 100% (i.e. 0 ≤ n ≤ 1),"

To assess the impact of beta1 integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions on the function of adult knee joints, we conditionally deleted the beta1 integrin gene in early limb mesenchyme using the Prx1-cre transgene. Mutant mice developed short limbed dwarfism and had joint defects due to beta1 integrin deficiency in articular regions. The articular cartilage (AC) was structurally disorganized, accompanied by accelerated terminal differentiation, altered shape, and disrupted actin cytoskeleton of the chondrocytes. Defects in chondrocyte proliferation, cytokinesis, and survival resulted in hypocellularity. However, no significant differences in cartilage erosion, in the expression of matrix-degrading proteases, or in the exposure of aggrecan and collagen II cleavage neoepitopes were observed between control and mutant AC. We found no evidence for disturbed activation of MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) in vivo. Furthermore, fibronectin fragment-stimulated ERK activation and MMP-13 expression were indistinguishable in control and mutant femoral head explants. The mutant synovium was hyperplastic and frequently underwent chondrogenic differentiation. beta1-null synoviocytes showed increased proliferation and phospho-focal adhesion kinase expression. Taken together, deletion of beta1 integrins in the limb bud results in multiple abnormalities of the knee joints; however, it does not accelerate AC destruction, perturb cartilage metabolism, or influence intracellular MAPK signaling pathways."

In cultured neuronal and pancreatic cell lines, production of NO• and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which activates PERK and results in cell dysfunction and apoptosis (6.Oyadomari S.

However, the UV-induced NOS activation and NO• production have never been shown to be related to the activation of eIF2α kinase(s). Now we demonstrate that UV-induced activation of NOS mediates the activation of both PERK and GCN2, which coordinately regulate the phosphorylation of eIF2α. HaCaT cells (kindly provided by Dr. Hongtao Yu, Jackson State University) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFwt), knock-out MEF cells (MEFPERK−/−) and GCN2 knock-out MEF (MEFGCN2−/−) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Randal Kaufman, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) were grown in 10% fetal calf serum-enriched Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro). The cells were incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2. UVB light was generated from two 15-watt UVB lamps (UVP Inc.). The intensity of UVB was measured by a UVB meter (UVP Inc.). Cells were treated with the UVB dose at 50 mJ/cm2. Medium was removed before the UVB treatment. NG-Methyl-l-arginine (LNMMA, Sigma) was used to inhibit NOS activity and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (LNAC, Sigma) was used to scavenge free radicals. The cells were pretreated with LNMMA (100 μm for HaCaT or 200 μm for MEFs) or LNAC (25 mm) for 1 h and then UVB-irradiated (50 mJ/cm2). Immediately after irradiation, the cells were cultured in the same medium with the inhibitors until further analysis. For l-Arg treatment, cells were supplemented with l-Arg (50 mm for HaCaT, 25 mm for MEFs, or as indicated) in the complete medium 1 h before UVB irradiation. Immediately after irradiation, the cells were cultured in fresh medium without l-Arg until further analysis. After treatment, cells were lysed by Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS) with proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). When phosphorylated proteins were analyzed, the phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma) was added into the lysis buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was measured by using a Bio-Rad Protein DC Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal amounts of protein were subjected on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 30 min using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For non-phosphorylated proteins, the membranes were blocked in 5% milk in phospho-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.02% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min. For phosphorylated proteins, the membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin instead of milk. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Cells were treated with chemicals and irradiated with UVB as indicated. Immediately after UV irradiation, the cells were cultured in fresh medium. At 4 h post irradiation, the cells were lysed by the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was measured by using the Bio-Rad Protein DC Assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The total amount of eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α were probed with antibodies against eIF2α (Cell Signaling) and phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling) using Western blot analysis. For analysis of the ratio of phosphorylated eIF2α/total eIF2α after UVB irradiation, COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with eIF2α expression vector (pETFVA−-2α) by Lipofactamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. After 36 h the transfected cells were UVB-irradiated (50 mJ/cm2) and lysed in the Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the indicated post irradiation time. The eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α were determined by Western blot analysis as previously reported (14.Brostrom C.O. Prostko C.R. Kaufman R.J. Brostrom M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24995-25002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with modified conditions. Equal amounts of cell lysate (5 μg of total protein) were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE with 150 V using a Mini-Gel Apparatus II (Bio-Rad) until the 38-kDa prestained protein marker (Invitrogen) was close to the bottom of the gel. The proteins were electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane, and eIF2α was probed with antibodies against eIF2α (Cell Signaling) as described above. The intensities of the bands of eIF2α and phosphorylated eIF2α were quantitated using ImageJ (v1.42k, National Institutes of Health). After treatment, the cells were labeled with Redivue Pro Mix [35S]Met/Cys (100 μCi/ml, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). After washing with PBS, cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 80 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% SDS). The protein concentration of the cell lysate was measured using the Bio-Rad protein DC assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a glass microfiber disk (Whatman GF/C). The disks were air-dried, washed once with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetate and twice with ice-cold 10% trichloroacetate. The disks were dried, and the radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Packard). HaCaT cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until 60–80% confluent. The culture medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without antibiotics, and then the cells were transfected with scrambled small interfering RNA (siRNA) (10 nm, sc-37007), PERK siRNA (10 nm, sc-36213), or GCN2 siRNA (10 nm, sc-45644) in 50 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All the siRNAs were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h before treatment. The lysates prepared from [35S]Met/Cys metabolic-labeled cells were incubated with rabbit anti-PERK (sc-13073, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-GCN2 (AP7130a, Abgent) polyclonal antibodies. The antibody-protein complexes were then precipitated by incubating with protein A-agarose beads (Vector Laboratories) at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (R-250) for 20 min, destained overnight, treated with En3Hance (PerkinElmer) for 20 min, dried, and autoradiographed. Electrospray mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on an LCQ DECA mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan). The cells were harvested by trypsin digestion, washed two times with PBS, and lysed in four times the volume of lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NH4OAc). The lysate was further diluted by 5-fold with MeOH/H2O/HOAc (50:50:1 by volume) and then introduced into the mass spectrometer at the flow rate of 5 μl/min for ionization by electrospray. The heated capillary temperature was kept at 150 °C. Data acquisition was performed using the software Xcalibur (version 2.0.7). Considering the possible matrix effect, the quantitative analysis of l-Arg in total lysate of HaCaT cells treated with 50 mml-Arg was performed using a standard addition method (15.Skoog D.A. Holler F.J. Crouch S.R. Principles of Instrumental Analysis. 6th Ed. Thomson Brooks/Cole, Belmont, CA2007: 13-17Google Scholar). Dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO as a 5 mm stock solution. The non-fluorescent DHR is oxidized by peroxides, and notably ONOO− (16.Rhyu D.Y. Yang Y. Ha H. Lee G.T.

FASEB J. 2003; 17: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), to form the green fluorescent product rhodamine 123, which can be detected with emission at 488 nm and excitation at 525 nm (18.Henderson L.M. Chappell J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). HaCaT cells were treated with LNMMA, LNAC, or l-Arg as mentioned before. At 4 h post-UVB (50 mJ/cm2), DHR was added to the medium at a working concentration of 10 μm and incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2 for 5 min. Medium was replaced by PBS before measuring the fluorescence using a multidetection fluorescence plate reader (SPECTRA MAX M2, MDS Analytical Technologies). The fluorescent images were captured by using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX70, Olympus). Student's t test was used to analyze the significance of data. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Previously, we, as well as others, reported that UVC induced eIF2α phosphorylation through activation of PERK and GCN2 (1.Deng J. Harding H.P. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Berlanga J.J. Scheuner D.

However, there is no report indicating that the more physiological UVB also induces eIF2α phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Because keratinocytes comprise >90% of total skin cells, we first determined the dose-dependent effect of UVB on a human keratinocyte cell line: HaCaT cells. The cells were treated with UVB in a physiological dose ranging from 0 to 125 mJ/cm2 in 25 mJ/cm2 intervals. The phosphorylation of eIF2α was increased in a dose-dependent manner from 0 to 125 mJ/cm2 (Fig. 1A). Our results demonstrate that eIF2α phosphorylation is dependent on the UVB dose in the range of 25–75 mJ/cm2 (Fig. 1A), which is much lower that the human minimal erythema dose (19.Beattie P.E. Finlan L.E. Kernohan N.M. Thomson G. Hupp T.R. Ibbotson S.H. Br. J. Dermatol. 2005; 152: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The middle point dose of 50 mJ/cm2 was chosen for our following experiments. Previous reports indicated that an estimated increase of 12% phosphorylated eIF2α is enough to significantly inhibit the activity of guanine nucleotide exchange factor and reduce 60–80% global protein synthesis (20.Clemens M.J.

Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further assess the extent of the effect of UVB on translation, we estimated the degree of eIF2α phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with eIF2α expression vector to increase the total amount of eIF2α. Our data showed that 15% of eIF2α was phosphorylated at 4 h post-UVB (50 mJ/cm2) (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation increased to 42% at 8 h post-UV and then decreased to 35 and 8% at 12 and 24 h post-UVB, respectively (Fig. 1B). To assess the contributions of eIF2α kinases in UVB-induced translational inhibition, we used siRNA to reduce the expression of PERK or GCN2. Scrambled siRNA was also used as a control. Because the expression levels of PERK and GCN2 are low, [35S]Met/Cys metabolic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation was used to detect the efficiency of synthesis of PERK and GCN2 after siRNA treatment. Our data showed that the translation of PERK or GCN2 is significantly reduced in cells that were transfected with the corresponding siRNA (Fig. 2A, lane 2 versus 1 and lane 6 versus 4) at 24 h post-transfection. With reduced expression of PERK or GCN2, the levels of eIF2α phosphorylation upon UVB irradiation were also reduced almost half in the cells that were transfected with PERK siRNA (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus 2) or GCN2 siRNA (Fig. 2B, lane 6 versus 2), respectively. The results indicate that both PERK and GCN2 contribute to the phosphorylation of eIF2α in human keratinocytes upon UVB irradiation. UV activates NOS and induces NO• production (12.Kubaszewski E.

Elevation of NO• and ONOO− has been shown to induce ER stress, which activates PERK and results in cell dysfunction and apoptosis in cultured cells (6.Oyadomari S. Takeda K. Takiguchi M. Gotoh T.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NOS-catalyzed NO• production depletes l-Arg and activates GCN2, which phosphorylates eIF2α (10.Lee J. Ryu H. Ferrante R.J. Morris Jr., S.M. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4843-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether UVB-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α is via activation of NOS signaling pathways, we pretreated the cells with a broad NOS inhibitor, an N-substituted l-arginine analog LNMMA (100 μm) for 1 h before UVB irradiation (50 mJ/cm2). Western blot analysis indicated that the UV-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α was reduced by 64% in the presence of LNMMA (Fig. 3, lane 4 versus 2) at 4 h post-UVB irradiation. This result suggests that NOS activation plays a role in UVB-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. Besides increasing the production of NO•, UV also induces an elevation of superoxide (O2̇̄) (23.Wiswedel I. Keilhoff G. Dörner L. Navarro A. Böckelmann R. Bonnekoh B. Gardemann A. Gollnick H. Free Radic. Res. 2007; 41: 1017-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which reacts rapidly with NO• to form ONOO− (24.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 17-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 25.Malinski T. Am. J. Cardiol. 2005; 96: 13i-24iAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Weller R. Billiar T. Vodovotz Y. Skin Pharmacol. Appl. Skin Physiol. 2002; 15: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because O2̇̄ and ONOO− induce oxidative-stress, which leads to PERK activation (9.Kawahara K. Oyadomari S. Gotoh T. Kohsaka S. Nakayama H. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27.Dickhout J.G. Hossain G.S. Pozza L.M. Zhou J. Lhoták S. Austin R.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we determined their roles in UVB-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. A glutathione (GSH) synthesis precursor LNAC (25 mm) was used to reduce oxidative stress. Our data showed that the UV-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α is reduced 59% in the presence of LNAC (Fig. 3, lane 6 versus 2). Because the NOS inhibitor also inhibits UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 3, lane 4 versus 2), these results indicate that UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation could be a result of oxidative stress. UV irradiation also activates GCN2 (1.Deng J. Harding H.P. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Berlanga J.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D. Sonenberg N. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 2.Jiang H.Y. Wek R.C. Biochem.

Cell Biochem. 2006; 293: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is regulated by amino acid starvation (29.Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). l-Arg is the precursor for NO• synthesis in vivo. Because NOS activation resulted in depletion of l-Arg and activation of GCN2 (10.Lee J. Ryu H. Ferrante R.J. Morris Jr., S.M. Ratan R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 4843-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we analyzed the impact of l-Arg on UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. At 4 h post-UVB treatment, the phosphorylation of eIF2α decreased dramatically within the concentration range of 10 to 50 mm of l-Arg (Fig. 4, lanes 4, 6, and 8 versus 2). Treating with higher concentrations of l-Arg (100 mm) did not further reduce the UVB-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α. Our results suggest that UVB-induced production of NO• lead to l-Arg depletion and sequentially activated GCN2. To further demonstrate that lack of l-Arg could be a factor for UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation, we estimated the intracellular amount of l-Arg (Mr = 174) in HaCaT cells using mass spectrometry. Our data showed that collision-induced dissociation (CID) of the ion of m/z 175, the protonated l-Arg ion generated from electrospray ionization of standard l-Arg (Fig. 4B, panel c), gives rise to the fragments of m/z 158 and 130 by losses of NH3 and HCOO•, respectively, and the fragments ions at m/z 60 and 116 due to the side-chain cleavage (Fig. 4B, panel c). Our data also showed that the ion of m/z 175 generated from ionization of the l-Arg-treated HaCaT cell lysate gave similar characteristic fragment ions (i.e. m/z 60, 116, 130, and 158) as that of the standard l-Arg (Fig. 4B, panel b versus c), which indicate the presence of l-Arg in the lysate. Quantitative analysis of l-Arg in total lysate of HaCaT cells treated with 50 mml-Arg was performed using the standard-addition method, and the result showed that the lysate contains 105.0 μml-Arg after considering the dilution factor of 25. However, the characteristic CID fragments of m/z 175 were not detected in the HaCaT cell lysate without treatment (Fig. 4B, panel a); instead, the fragments from the background peak of m/z 175 was observed. For comparison, we tested CID experiments with low concentrations of l-Arg standard solutions. The data showed that the characteristic CID fragments are well observed even for the l-Arg standard in MeOH/H2O/HOAc (50:50:1 by volume) with concentration as low as 0.1 μm. These results suggest that l-Arg in the HaCaT cell lysate without treatment is lower than 2.5 μm after considering the dilution factor. These results suggest that lack of l-Arg could be the cause of UVB-induced GCN2 activation due to its low intracellular concentration. To more quantitatively analyze the oxidative stress and the generation of ONOO− after UVB irradiation, we determined the relative amount of ONOO− in the irradiated cells using the DHR fluorescence method (16.Rhyu D.Y. Yang Y. Ha H. Lee G.T. Song J.S. Uh S.T. Lee H.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 17.Allen D.A. Harwood S. Varagunam M. Raftery M.J. Yaqoob M.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 908-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The data showed that, compared with the control cells, an increased fluorescence was detected in the UVB-treated cells (Fig. 5A). Quantitative fluorescent analysis showed that ONOO− increased 0.8-fold at 4 h post irradiation (Fig. 5B). Although the UVB-induced elevation of ONOO− was reduced by a non-statistically significant 0.3- and 0.4-fold after LNMMA or l-Arg treatment, respectively, the ONOO− was statistically significantly reduced 0.6-fold after LNAC treatment (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that the generation of ONOO− was the result of, at least partially, to UVB-induced oxidative stress. After elucidating the role of NOS in UVB-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α, we determined whether NOS-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation correlates with translation inhibition. [35S]Met/Cys metabolic labeling and trichloroacetate precipitation methods were used to quantitatively analyze the efficiency of nascent protein synthesis. The extent of translation was reduced to 44% at 4 h post-UVB irradiation (Fig. 6). Treating the irradiated cells with LNMMA, LNAC, or l-Arg partially restored protein synthesis to 65%, 57 and 51%, respectively (Fig. 6). However, the affects were not statistically significant. These results indicate that, although NOS plays a role in UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation, its role in translation regulation is still not conclusive. To further confirm that NOS coordinates the activation of PERK and GCN2, we analyzed the effect of LNMMA, LNAC, and l-Arg on the UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation in MEFwt, MEFPERK−/−, and MEFGCN2−/− cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation increased >2-fold in MEFwt cells (Fig. 7A, lane 2 versus 1, and Table 1). However, the eIF2α phosphorylation increased <0.5-fold in MEFPERK−/− (Fig. 7B, lane 2 versus 1, and Table 1), whereas there was no increase in MEFGCN2−/− cells (Fig. 7C, lane 2 versus 1, and Table 1) after UVB irradiation. The results agree with previous reports that PERK or GCN2 mediate UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (1.Deng J. Harding H.P. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Berlanga J.J. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ron D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18077-18083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Treatment of LNMMA, LNAC, or l-Arg partially reduced eIF2α phosphorylation with differential percentages in all cell lines in the absence or presence of UVB irradiation (Table 1), which indicates that NOS/oxidative stress is playing a role in the maintenance of the basal level of eIF2α phosphorylation in MEF cells. These results also suggest that NOS, reactive oxygen species, and l-Arg depletion differentially coordinate the activation of PERK and GCN2 upon UVB irradiation. The NOS inhibitor LNMMA is more effective in the regulation of eIF2α phosphorylation in MEFwt cells than MEFPERK−/− and MEFGCN2−/− cells (Fig. 7 and Table 1), indicating that NOS coordinates the activation of both PERK and GCN2.TABLE 1Relative eIF2α phosphorylationControlUVLNMMAUV + LNMMALNACUV + LNACl-ArgUV + l-ArgA: WT100219.7 ± 19.357.3 ± 6.7161.9 ± 4.549.5 ± 17.7183.4 ± 28.692.6 ± 23.4152.6 ± 41.3B: PERK−/−100140.6 ± 11.287.5 ± 13.7125.2 ± 11.181.1 ± 15.578.4 ± 10.667.5 ± 11.4117.8 ± 3.2C: CN2−/−10096.5 ± 5.077.5 ± 1.890.0 ± 3.548.0 ± 1.335.2 ± 8.328.1 ± 5.023.8 ± 5.6Column:12345678 Open table in a new tab UV irradiation inhibits translation via activation of two serine-threonine kinases, PERK and GCN2, which phosphorylate the Ser-51 of eIF2α (1.Deng J.

GCN2 is an amino acid abundance-controlled eIF2α kinase, which is activated during amino acid starvation (29.Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C. Genetics. 2000; 154: 787-801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Berlanga J.J. Santoyo J. De Haro C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Although the roles of PERK and GCN2 in UV-induced translation inhibition and downstream signal transduction have been previously elucidated (2.Jiang H.Y. Wek R.C. Biochem.

Cell Biochem. 2006; 293: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), their key activators have not been identified. We now demonstrate that UVB-induced translational inhibition in cultured human skin cells is, at least partially, mediated by NOS-catalyzed NO• production in combination with superoxide production. Based on our results, we propose a pathway for the UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 8). In this model, UVB irradiation induces NOS activation, which rapidly generates NO• from l-Arg. The reduced availability of l-Arg leads to NOS uncoupling and GCN2 activation. The uncoupled NOS then produces O2̇̄, which reacts with NO• to form ONOO−. The elevated ONOO− level leads to the generation of oxidative stress and activation of PERK. Our findings not only significantly advance our understanding of the pathway for UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation but also elucidate a role of NOS in coordinative regulation of two activator-specific eIF2α kinases. Our results also unify previously controversial conclusions regarding the role of PERK and GCN2 in UV-induced eIF2α phosphorylation (1.Deng J. Harding H.P. Raught B. Gingras A.C. Berlanga J.J.

Using the siRNA method, we demonstrated that both PERK and GCN2 contribute to the UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation at the same time frames and under the same conditions in human keratinocytes HaCaT (Fig. 2). Keratinocytes have been shown to contain NOS that can be activated by UVB exposure (12.Kubaszewski E. Peters A. McClain S. Bohr D. Malinski T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22.Deliconstantinos G. Villiotou V. Stavrides J.C. Exp.

Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1257-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our data showed that eIF2α phosphorylation was reduced after treating the cells with an NOS inhibitor, LNMMA, the GSH precursor LNAC or l-Arg (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). l-Arg is the only precursor of NO• generated by NOS. Generation of NO• could lead to l-Arg depletion, which could in turn lead to NOS uncoupling and O2̇̄ production (37.Huk I. Nanobashvili J. Neumayer C. Punz A. Mueller M. Afkhampour K. Mittlboeck M. Losert U. Polterauer P. Roth E. Patton S. Malinski T. Circulation. 1997; 96: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). O2̇̄ rapidly reacts with NO• to form ONOO− (38.Beckman J.S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32552-32557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 41.Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin.

Biol. 2005; 25: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The effects of the antioxidant and l-Arg on UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation indicate that both NOS and oxidative stress play roles in UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation. The generation of the strong oxidant ONOO− was further substantiated by the increased fluorescence of oxidized DHR after UVB irradiation (Fig. 5A), which is significantly reduced by treating the cells with LNAC (Fig. 5B). The UVB-induced translation inhibition was also partially reversed, with less effectiveness and non-statistically significant, by treating the cells with LNMMA, LNAC, or l-Arg (Fig. 6). This could be due to the fact that only a very low percentage of phosphorylated eIF2α is required to reduce global protein synthesis (21.Rowlands A.G. Panniers R. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5526-5533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 4 h post-UVB, ∼15% of the total eIF2α is phosphorylated (Fig. 1B). Even with a 60% reduction of the eIF2α phosphorylation, there are still 6% of phosphorylated eIF2α, which may reduce guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity and inhibit translation. The reduced effectiveness of l-Arg on reversing the translation inhibition is not clear. One possible cause is that supplement of l-Arg leads to the production of a large amount of NO•, which inhibits protein synthesis through an eIF2α-independent pathway as previously reported (42.Curran R.D. Ferrari F.K. Kispert P.H. Stadler J. Stuehr D.J. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2085-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The extent of the effects of LNMMA, LNAC, or l-Arg on UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation in parent and mutated MEF cells is very interesting. Distinctive from HaCaT cells, a background eIF2α phosphorylation was observed in all three MEF cell lines, which was the same as we observed before in MEFwt cells (4.Wu S. Tan M. Hu Y. Wang J.L. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34898-34902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In MEFwt cells, NOS and oxidative stress is required, whereas supplement of l-Arg is not required, for maintaining basal eIF2α phosphorylation in MEFwt cells (Table 1, A3, 5, and 7 versus A1). UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation mainly results from l-Arg depletion, which could be mediated by NOS (Table 1, A4 and 8 versus A2). Interestingly, reducing oxidative stress had less impact on eIF2α phosphorylation in the UVB-treated cells than non-treated cells (Table 1, A6 versus A5). This could be due to the generation of the strong oxidant peroxynitrite by uncoupled NOS, which induces the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein (43.Oh-Hashi K. Maruyama W. Isobe K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and sequentially dephosphorylates eIF2α. In MEFPERK−/− cells, l-Arg shortage-mediated GCN2 activation plays a more significant role for maintaining basal eIF2α phosphorylation (Table 1, B7 versus B1, 3, and 5). However, UVB-induced eIF2α phosphorylation mainly resulted from oxidative stress (Table 1, B6 versus B2, 4, and 8). One possible pathway is that induced expression of activating transcription factor 4 is needed for biosynthesis of glutathione (44.Ogawa Y. Saito Y. Nishio K. Yoshida Y. Ashida H. Niki E. Free Radic. Res. 2008; 42: 674-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which reduces oxidative stress induced by UVB irradiation (45.Tyrrell R.M. Pidoux M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1986; 44: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Reduced inducibility of activating transcription factor 4 in response to UVB-induced ER stress may lead to an increased level of oxidative-stress, which activates GCN2 as recently reported in yeast (46.Mascarenhas C. Edwards-Ingram L.C. Zeef L. Shenton D. Ashe M.P. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 2995-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The MEFGCN2−/− cells were under oxidative stress and l-Arg starvation, because the LNAC or l-Arg supplement significantly reduced eIF2α phosphorylation without or with UVB irradiation (Table 1, C5–8 versus C1 and 2). Because l-Arg biosynthesis is up-regulated by general control nonderepressible protein kinase 4, whose activity is positively controlled by GCN2 (47.Hinnebusch A.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 248-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Crabeel M. Huygen R. Verschueren K. Messenguy F. Tinel K. Cunin R. Glansdorff N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3139-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of l-Arg is lower in the cells. The lack of l-Arg could lead to NOS uncoupling and generation of NO• and O2̇̄, which rapidly form ONOO− and therefore oxidative stress (35.Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 38.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 226-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because l-Arg is depleted and oxidative stress levels are high in the cells, UVB irradiation is unable to further induce them and sequentially eIF2α phosphorylation. Treatment of LNMMA inhibits NOS and stops further generation of ONOO− but does not reduce the existing oxidative stress. Treatment of l-Arg leads to NOS coupling, which increases the NO•/ONOO− ratio and reduces the oxidative stress. This pathway explains the effectiveness of LNAC or l-Arg in reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation without or with UVB irradiation. It could also explain the correlation of oxidative stress with l-Arg depletion in reducing eIF2α phosphorylation in MEFGCN2−/− cells. We thank Oliver L. Carpenter and Dr. Roxanne Male-Brune for editorial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2052888507,"Voltage-gated potassium (K(v)) channels are among the earliest ion channels to appear during brain development, suggesting a functional requirement for progenitor cell proliferation and/or differentiation. We tested this hypothesis, using human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) as a model system.In proliferating hNPCs a broad spectrum of K(v) channel subtypes was identified using quantitative real-time PCR with a predominant expression of the A-type channel K(v)4.2. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings K(v) currents were separated into a large transient component characteristic for fast-inactivating A-type potassium channels (I(A)) and a small, sustained component produced by delayed-rectifying channels (I(K)). During differentiation the expression of I(A) as well as A-type channel transcripts dramatically decreased, while I(K) producing delayed-rectifiers were upregulated. Both K(v) currents were differentially inhibited by selective neurotoxins like phrixotoxin-1 and alpha-dendrotoxin as well as by antagonists like 4-aminopyridine, ammoniumchloride, tetraethylammonium chloride and quinidine. In viability and proliferation assays chronic inhibition of the A-type currents severely disturbed the cell cycle and precluded proper hNPC proliferation, while the blockade of delayed-rectifiers by alpha-dendrotoxin increased proliferation.These findings suggest that A-type potassium currents are essential for proper proliferation of immature multipotent hNPCs."

We have reported that RBM15, a primarily nuclear protein, also binds to the general mRNA export factor NXF1 (20Lindtner S. Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Bear J. Kulkarni V. Smulevitch S. Samiotaki M.

In contrast to RTE, the constitutive transport element (CTE)-containing Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/simian retrovirus viral RNAs are exported via direct binding of the CTE to the NXF1 nuclear export receptor (25Grüter P.

Thus, although both RTE and CTE promote export of viral RNAs using cellular factors, the detailed mechanism of function is thought to be distinct: CTE binds NXF1 directly, whereas RTE has the ability to interact with NXF1 via RBM15.

The mouse ES cell line XK135 (obtained from BayGenomics; funded by the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health), harbors a LacZ-neo fusion cassette inserted into the first coding exon of RBM15, 20 nucleotides upstream the initiator codon, generating a hypomorphic RBM15XK135 allele. After injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts, the chimeric mice were bred for germline transmission. Genomic DNA from tail snips or yolk sacs was used for PCR genotyping. RBM15 alleles were detected by PCR using primers that span the cassette insertion site. Total RNA from the genotyped mouse embryos was analyzed on GE Healthcare CodeLinkTM mouse whole genome bioarrays. Expression data and detailed protocols have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (29Edgar R. Domrachev M. Lash A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (8044) Google Scholar) and are accessible through GEO accession number GSE11785. Because the existing normalization approaches were not applicable for data sets reflecting biologically relevant intensity-dependent differences (30Wu W. Dave N. Tseng G.C. Richards T. Xing E.P. Kaminski N. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 309Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the expression data were not subject to intensity normalization. The biologically relevant groups of transcripts in expression data sets were evaluated using PANTHER tools. The expression data were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney two-sample rank sum test, with α = 0.05. The embryonic genotype distributions were compared with the Mendelian distribution by using the χ2 test. Data pruning was performed by averaging every 20 rows to produce one output row, using the GraphPad Prizm software. The amino acid sequences of SPEN superfamily proteins were compiled using Batch Entrez and BLAST utilities at NCBI. Multiple amino acid sequence alignments were performed using MAFFT software (31Katoh K. Kuma K. Toh H. Miyata T.

The SPEN family proteins SHARP, RBM15, and OTT3 share the domain architecture comprising of three N-terminal RRM and a SPOC domain (1Kuang B. Wu S.C. Shin Y. Luo L. Kolodziej P.

Development. 1999; 126: 5373-5385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We used amino acid sequence alignments and molecular phylogeny to compare the SPEN proteins within and across species. This analysis suggested that the large and small proteins are separate classes that split before the existence of a common ancestor of nematodes and humans (Fig. 1B, node 1). Notably, the small SPEN proteins of vertebrates formed two distinct clusters across taxa that we termed RBM15-like and OTT3-like (Fig. 1B, node 2), whereas the small proteins of insects (NITO) and nematodes (F29C4.7) were confined to taxa-specific clusters. In the RBM15-like and OTT3-like clusters, the branches were congruent with taxonomy (Fig. 1C), strongly supporting orthology within these groups. Thus, these data suggested a biologically relevant difference between OTT3 and RBM15 that is conserved in vertebrates. We previously found that RBM15 acts at the post-transcriptional level and promotes export and expression of reporter transcripts (20Lindtner S. Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Bear J. Kulkarni V.

In this report, we tested OTT3 for such function using the DM128/B cat mRNA tethering assay (26Wiegand H.L. Lu S. Cullen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11327-11332Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In this system, the reporter transcript contains the cat gene and the high affinity binding sites (Fig. 2A, box B) for the RNA-binding N-terminal domain of lambdoid phage P22 antiterminator protein N (Fig. 2A, N-peptide). This reporter RNA is designed to be retained in the nucleus and hence expresses only background levels of CAT protein. Fusion of the N-peptide to a protein with mRNA export activity leads to its tethering to the DM128/B transcript, resulting in stimulation of CAT expression. Because the major expression defect of DM128/B transcript is due to inefficient nuclear export, CAT expression activation provides a read-out of mRNA export activity of the tethered protein. Cotransfection of the cat reporter with the untagged proteins, which cannot interact with the box B-containing cat transcript, serves as specificity control. N-peptide fusions with OTT3 and deletions thereof were generated (Fig. 2B), and their expression was verified using indirect immunofluorescence of HA-tagged proteins (data not shown). Coexpression of the N-tagged full-length OTT3 with DM128/B revealed its RNA export activity (Fig. 2C). In parallel transfections, we found that N-tagged RBM15 as well as the N-tagged NXF1 activated CAT expression as expected (20Lindtner S. Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Bear J. Kulkarni V. Smulevitch S.

No activation was observed upon coexpression of OTT3 or RBM15 lacking the N-peptide, demonstrating that tethering to the transcript is essential for function and also shows that these proteins do not have transcriptional function. This assay further allows the dissection of the protein domains and allows a qualitative assessment of their activity. Fig. 2C shows that the C-terminal region spanning aa 488–890 of OTT3 is active, in contrast to the N-terminal region spanning aa 1–487, and this finding is in overall agreement with the reported properties of the domains of the related RBM15 (Fig. 2C) (20Lindtner S.

These data support the conclusion that OTT3 promotes the nuclear export of cat transcript, acting via its C-terminal region. Thus, OTT3 has mRNA export activity like previously reported RBM15, NXF1, and HIV-1 Rev (20Lindtner S. Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Bear J. Kulkarni V. Smulevitch S. Samiotaki M. Panayotou G.

However, OTT3 does not shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, pointing to its function as export cofactor rather than export receptor, similar to the reported role of RBM15 (20Lindtner S.

We expressed the empty NLgag and the RTE-containing NLgag-RTE (Fig. 3A) in human HeLa-derived HLtat cells, in the absence or presence of coexpressed SPEN proteins. We found that none of the SPEN proteins had an effect on empty NLgag, confirming the absence of nonspecific effects. These data further support the notion that the export factors need to interact specifically with the target transcript (see also Fig. 2). As expected, the presence of RTE in the gag-RTE transcript resulted in induction of Gag expression (20Lindtner S. Zolotukhin A.S. Uranishi H. Bear J. Kulkarni V. Smulevitch S. Samiotaki M.

The subclass type IIn (ref. 6) supernovae are luminous core-collapse explosions of massive stars and, unlike other types, are very bright in the ultraviolet, which should enable them to be found optically at redshifts z approximately 2 and higher.

https://openalex.org/W2022539323,"Background Linear motifs are short modules of protein sequences that play a crucial role in mediating and regulating many protein–protein interactions. The function of linear motifs strongly depends on the context, e.g. functional instances mainly occur inside flexible regions that are accessible for interaction. Sometimes linear motifs appear as isolated islands of conservation in multiple sequence alignments. However, they also occur in larger blocks of sequence conservation, suggesting an active role for the neighbouring amino acids. Results The evolution of regions flanking 116 functional linear motif instances was studied. The conservation of the amino acid sequence and order/disorder tendency of those regions was related to presence/absence of the instance. For the majority of the analysed instances, the pairs of sequences conserving the linear motif were also observed to maintain a similar local structural tendency and/or to have higher local sequence conservation when compared to pairs of sequences where one is missing the linear motif. Furthermore, those instances have a higher chance to co–evolve with the neighbouring residues in comparison to the distant ones. Those findings are supported by examples where the regulation of the linear motif–mediated interaction has been shown to depend on the modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) at neighbouring positions or is thought to benefit from the binding versatility of disordered regions. Conclusion The results suggest that flanking regions are relevant for linear motif–mediated interactions, both at the structural and sequence level. More interestingly, they indicate that the prediction of linear motif instances can be enriched with contextual information by performing a sequence analysis similar to the one presented here. This can facilitate the understanding of the role of these predicted instances in determining the protein function inside the broader context of the cellular network where they arise."
https://openalex.org/W2114529864,"Background Historically, respiratory infections have had a significant impact on U.S. military missions. Deployed troops are particularly at high risk due to close living conditions, stressful work environments and increased exposure to pathogens. To date, there are limited data available on acute respiratory illness (ARI) among troops deployed in support of ongoing military operations, specifically Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). Methods Using self-report data from two sources collected from troops deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and the surrounding region, we analyzed incidence and risk factors for ARI. Military personnel on mid-deployment Rest & Recuperation (R&R) or during redeployment were eligible to participate in the voluntary self-report survey. Results Overall, 39.5% reported having at least one ARI. Of these, 18.5% sought medical care and 33.8% reported having decreased job performance. The rate of self-reported ARI was 15 episodes per 100 person-months among those taking the voluntary survey, and 24.7 episodes per 100 person-months among those taking the clinic health questionnaire. Negative binomial regression analysis found female sex, Navy branch of service and lack of flush toilets to be independently associated with increased rates of ARI. Deployment to OIF, increasing age and higher rank were also positively associated with ARI risk. Conclusions The overall percentage of deployed military personnel reporting at least one acute respiratory illness decreased since earlier parts of OIF/OEF. However, the reported effect on job performance increased tremendously. The most important factors associated with increased respiratory infection are female sex, Navy branch of service, lack of improved latrine facilities, deployment to OIF, increasing age and higher rank."
https://openalex.org/W1980670952,"Net1 is a nuclear Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is specific for the RhoA subfamily of small G proteins. Truncated forms of Net1 are transforming in NIH3T3 cells, and this activity requires cytoplasmic localization of Net1 as well as the presence of a COOH-terminal PDZ binding site. We have previously shown that Net1 interacts with PDZ domain-containing proteins within the Discs Large (Dlg) family and relocalizes them to the nucleus. In the present work, we demonstrate that Net1 binds directly to the first two PDZ domains of Dlg1 and that both PDZ domains are required for maximal interaction in cells. Furthermore, we show that Net1 is an unstable protein in MCF7 breast epithelial cells and that interaction with Dlg1 significantly enhances Net1 stability. Stabilization by Dlg1 significantly increases the ability of Net1 to stimulate RhoA activation in cells. The stability of endogenous Net1 is strongly enhanced by cell-cell contact, and this correlates with a dramatic increase in the interaction between Net1 and Dlg1. Importantly, disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cell contacts, either by depletion of external calcium or by treatment with transforming growth factor beta, leads to a rapid loss of the interaction between Net1 and Dlg1 and a subsequent increase in the ubiquitylation of Net1. These results indicate that Net1 requires interaction with PDZ domain proteins, such as Dlg1, to protect it from proteasome-mediated degradation and to maximally stimulate RhoA and that this interaction is regulated by cell-cell contact."

https://openalex.org/W2171612960,"Deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate pyrophosphatases (dUTPases) are ubiquitous enzymes essential for hydrolysis of dUTP, thus preventing its incorporation into DNA. Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) dUTPase is monomeric, it has a high degree of similarity with the more frequent trimeric form of the enzyme. In both cases, the active site is composed of five conserved sequence motifs. Structural and functional studies of mutants based on the structure of EBV dUTPase gave new insight into the mechanism of the enzyme. A first mutant allowed us to exclude a role in enzymatic activity for the disulfide bridge involving the beginning of the disordered C terminus. Sequence alignments revealed two groups of dUTPases, based on the position in sequence of a conserved aspartic acid residue close to the active site. Single mutants of this residue in EBV dUTPase showed a highly impaired catalytic activity, which could be partially restored by a second mutation, making EBV dUTPase more similar to the second group of enzymes. Deletion of the flexible C-terminal tail carrying motif V resulted in a protein completely devoid of enzymatic activity, crystallizing with unhydrolyzed Mg(2+)-dUTP complex in the active site. Point mutations inside motif V highlighted the essential role of lid residue Phe(273). Magnesium appears to play a role mainly in substrate binding, since in absence of Mg(2+), the K(m) of the enzyme is reduced, whereas the k(cat) is less affected."

Relevance to human disease by manipulating CD244 in mouse models is complicated by rodent CD2 also binding CD48. We distinguish between contributions of mouse CD244 and CD2 on engagement of CD48 in a mouse T cell hybridoma. CD2 and CD244 both contribute positively to the immune response as mutation of proline-rich motifs or tyrosine motifs in the tails of CD2 and CD244, respectively, result in a decrease in antigen-specific interleukin-2 production. Inhibitory effects of mouse CD244 are accounted for by competition with CD2 at the cell surface for CD48. In humans CD2 and CD244 are engaged separately at the cell surface but biochemical data suggest a potential conserved intracellular link between the two receptors through FYN kinase. We identify a novel signaling mechanism for CD244 through its potential to recruit phospholipase C-γ1 via the conserved phosphorylated tyrosine motif in the tail of the adaptor protein EAT-2, which we show is important for function.

These receptors have related extracellular immunoglobulin superfamily domains and interact either homophilically or heterophilically within the CD2 family (1Nichols K.E. Ma C.S. Cannons J.L.

The CD2 family contains a subgroup of receptors termed the SLAM family that have a conserved tyrosine signaling motif in their cytoplasmic region TXYXX(I/V) referred to as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). 2The abbreviations used are:ITSMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motifCD2APCD2-associated proteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryCIN85Cbl interating protein of 85 kDaCMSp130Cas ligand with multiple SH3 domainsCTLA-4cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4EAT-2Ewing's sarcoma-activated transcript 2FYNFYN oncogene related to SRCGSTglutathione S-transferaseLATlinker for activation of T cellsLCKlymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinaseMCCmoth cytochrome cPLCγ1phospholipase C-γ1SLAMsignaling lymphocytic activation moleculeSAPSLAM-associated proteinSHSrc homologyEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinmAbmonoclonal antibodyILinterleukinaaamino acid(s). The SLAM family of receptors include CD244 (2B4), NTB-A (Ly-108), CD319 (CRACC, CS-1), CD150 (SLAM), CD84, and CD229 (Ly-9). Defects in signaling and aberrant expression of these receptors have been implicated in several immunodeficiency and autoimmune disorders in humans and mice (4Cunninghame Graham D.S. Vyse T.J.

Immunol. 2006; 6: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Within the SLAM family, CD244 is unusual in that it shares its ligand CD48 with the receptor CD2 in rodents, whereas in humans CD2 has evolved to interact with CD58 (9Davis S.J. Ikemizu S. Wild M.K. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The affinity of CD244 for CD48 in rodents is 6–9-fold higher than the still functionally relevant CD2/CD48 interaction (10Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J.

In contrast to SH2 interactions of CD244, several SH3 domain-mediated interactions have been reported for the cytoplasmic region of CD2 including CD2AP/CMS, CIN85, FYN, and LCK (22Bell G.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7320-7336Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The activating function of CD244 was called into question when a study using cells from a CD244 knock-out mouse showed that CD244 had an inhibitory effect as loss of CD244 resulted in enhanced NK killing of target cells (27Lee K.M. McNerney M.E. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A. Schatzle J.D. Bennett M. Kumar V. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This suggested that previous results in mice where positive effects were seen may have been due to blocking CD244 ligand engagement as opposed to cross-linking with antibodies against CD244 (27Lee K.M. McNerney M.E. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A. Schatzle J.D. Bennett M. Kumar V. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This has led to proposals that there are differences in function between mouse and human CD244 as there is more evidence to suggest that human CD244 is a positive regulator enhancing cytotoxicity and cytokine production (13Tangye S.G. Cherwinski H. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Valiante N.M. Trinchieri G. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2007; 37: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, other more recent studies have shown the mouse CD244/CD48 interaction to be important for cytokine production and effector functions such as cytotoxicity against tumor targets in CD244-deficient mice (29Lee K.M. Forman J.P. McNerney M.E. Stepp S. Kuppireddi S. Guzior D. Latchman Y.E. Sayegh M.H. Yagita H. Park C.K. Oh S.B. Wülfing C. Schatzle J. Mathew P.A. Sharpe A.H. Kumar V. Blood. 2006; 107: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Long and short forms of CD244 have been cloned from mice with the short form being described as activating and the long form inhibitory (27Lee K.M. McNerney M.E. Stepp S.E. Mathew P.A. Schatzle J.D.

Mathew P.A. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 181: 234-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Positive signaling by CD244 has been attributed to the recruitment of SAP (18Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar), which is a signaling adaptor molecule comprised of a single SH2 domain encoded by the SH2D1A gene and has the ability to recruit the kinase FYN by binding its SH3 domain (31Chan B.

Chen R. Bakinowski M. Shi X. Schwartzberg P.L. Davidson D. Veillette A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Loss of the SAP/FYN interaction can lead to X-linked lymphoproliferative disease in humans (17Morra M. Lu J. Poy F. Martin M. Sayos J. Calpe S. Gullo C. Howie D. Rietdijk S. Thompson A. Coyle A.J. Denny C. Yaffe M.B. Engel P. Eck M.J. Terhorst C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5840-5852Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of in vitro inhibitory effects observed with CD244 in mice on ligation with mAb or ligand remains elusive (33Chlewicki L.K. Velikovsky C.A. Balakrishnan V. Mariuzza R.A. Kumar V. J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 8159-8167Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein tyrosine and inositol phosphatases have been reported to associate with CD244 (18Tangye S.G. Lazetic S. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6981-6985PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen R. Relouzat F. Roncagalli R. Aoukaty A. Tan R. Latour S. Veillette A. Mol. Cell.

Blood. 2005; 105: 4722-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) but our studies using surface plasmon resonance found them to be very weak and unlikely to bind competitively compared with the SAP family of adaptors or FYN (16Clarkson N.G. Simmonds S.J. Puklavec M.J. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25385-25394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The SAP-related adaptor EAT-2 has been reported to have an active inhibitory effect that is dependent on tyrosine motifs in the tail of EAT-2 (35Roncagalli R. Taylor J.E. Zhang S. Shi X. Chen R. Cruz-Munoz M.E. Yin L. Latour S. Veillette A. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1002-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) but its mechanism is not understood. The only interaction reported for the tail of EAT-2 is with FYN kinase and studies overexpressing EAT-2 in a T cell hybridoma resulted in increased IL-2 production upon antigen stimulation (16Clarkson N.G. Simmonds S.J. Puklavec M.J. Brown M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25385-25394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The conservation between mouse and human CD244 cytoplasmic regions and associated adaptors suggests that both function in a similar way. We have explored the main difference between mouse and human CD244, which is the extracellular interaction through CD48 ligation in the mouse. This has revealed that inhibitory effects of CD244 ligation in mice can be due to competition between CD244 and CD2 for CD48. We have also found that the adaptor protein EAT-2 binds PLCγ1 providing a molecular basis for the important role CD244 plays in regulating cellular cytotoxicity (13Tangye S.G. Cherwinski H. Lanier L.L. Phillips J.H. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 36Nakajima H. Cella M. Langen H. Friedlein A. Colonna M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1676-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that there is a potentially shared signaling mechanism through the FYN kinase that links CD2 and CD244 intracellularly even though in humans CD2 and CD244 no longer share a cell surface ligand. Mutated forms of mouse CD2 and mouse CD244 (the long form (10Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp.

Mutations to mouse CD244 consisted of single aa substitutions of Tyr to Phe in the 4 ITSM motifs, TXYXX(I/V). CD2 was cloned into pBabe puro vector (16Clarkson N.G. Simmonds S.J. Puklavec M.J.

Mutant CD2 was made by replacement of an EcoRI-SalI fragment. EAT-2 and mutated EAT-2 were constructed by PCR and cloned into BglII-SalI cut pLEGFP-C1 (Clontech) as a BamHI-SalI fragment. CD244 was cloned into pBabe puro and pFBNEO (Stratagene) as an EcoRI-SalI fragment and mutant CD244 into pBabe puro as EcoRI-SalI fragments. Mouse CD2 and CD2 mutants were expressed in 2B4 Reay T hybridoma cells by transfection into the retroviral packaging line EcoPhoenix by FuGENETM and subsequent transduction (16Clarkson N.G.

Wild type CD244 in pFBNEO was transduced into these cells. 2B4 Saito T hybridoma cells expressing mouse CD2 or a tailless CD2 (37Wild M.K. Cambiaggi A. Brown M.H. Davies E.A. Ohno H.

Cells were selected in puromycin (1 μg/ml) and G418 (1 mg/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5–10% fetal calf serum.

Expression levels were checked by standard flow cytometry techniques. BIACore analyses using a BIACoreTM 3000 were carried out essentially as described previously (16Clarkson N.G. Simmonds S.J.

Streptavidin (∼3000 response units) was directly coupled to CM5 chips by amine coupling for immobilization of biotinylated phosphorylated peptides (Table 1) (Peptide Protein Research Ltd. (Fareham, UK). Full-length human SAP-glutathione S-transferase (GST) was immobilized by anti-GST mAb amine coupled to the surface of the chip (∼7000–8000 response units). In measurements of binding to the four ITSM peptides, one flow cell was used as a negative control and then coated with the fourth peptide, and equilibrium binding was repeated. At the level of immobilization of peptide (∼25 response unit) there was no difference between negative controls of streptavidin or an irrelevant phosphorylated peptide. For the SAP-GST a control flow cell of immobilized anti-GST mAb was used as a control. Measurements of FYN-SH3-SH2 binding to CD2 peptides were carried out as above but with ∼100 response units of CD2 peptide (Table 1) bound to the surface of the chip. In FYN-SH3-SH2 complex binding experiments the concentration of FYN-SH3-SH2 was constant at 5 μm, whereas nonbiotinylated phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides in solution were titrated.TABLE 1Synthetic peptides of human receptorsNameSequenceEAT-2 127Biotin-NSNSD(pY)VDVLP-COOHCTLA-4Biotin-KQFQP(pY)FIPIN-COOHCD2-322 PR mutantBiotin-QKGPPLPRAAVQPKPPHG-COOHCD2-281-305Biotin-HPPPPPGHRSQAPSHRPPPPGHRVQ-COOHCD2-322Biotin-QKGPPLPRPRVQPKPPHG-COOHCD244 ITSM 1Biotin-EFLTI(pY)EDVKD-COOHLAT 132Biotin-HNPG(pY)LVVLP-COOH Open table in a new tab Assays for antigen-specific IL-2 production by T hybridoma cells were performed in a 96-well round bottom plate with 105 cells/well of the T cell hybridomas and CHO IEK mouse CD48+ve cells in the presence of 1 μm moth cytochrome c peptide (MCC) (16Clarkson N.G.

Assays were performed in RPMI + 5% fetal bovine serum for 16 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. Supernatants were harvested and assayed for IL-2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences). mAbs used were as follows: anti-mouse CD3 (KT3) rat IgG2a, anti-mouse CD2 (RM2.1) rat IgG2a, anti-mouse CD48 (OX78) rat IgG2a, anti-rat κ-chain (OX11) rat IgG2a, anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PT66; Sigma), anti-PLCγ1 (Cell Signaling), anti-EAT-2 (Santa Cruz), phycoerythrin-coupled secondary antibodies (Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled secondary antibodies (Serotec), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary reagents (Sigma and Bio-Rad). Fab fragments were produced by papain digestion using standard techniques and subjected to gel filtration on an S200 Superdex column (GE Healthcare). Recombinant soluble proteins representing SH3 and/or SH2 domains of human signaling proteins were provided by Louise Bird (Oxford Module Consortium). Proteins were expressed as N-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins and purified using nickel-agarose affinity chromatography.

Human T blasts (108) cultured with 5 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin and 100 IU human IL-2/ml in RPMI + 5% fetal calf serum were pelleted and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before being lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 + mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 20 min at 4 °C before being pre-cleared with 25 μl of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads (Invitrogen). Biotinylated synthetic peptides were coupled to streptavidin Dynal beads at saturating concentrations (8 μl of peptide (2 mg/ml (1 mm)) added to 25 μl beads) at 4 °C for 30 min with agitation.

A sample was excised from the resolving gel immediately after passing through the stacking gel so as to avoid separation of proteins and potential loss of sample. Cell lysates were prepared at 108 cells/ml using Triton X-100 detergent as described above (31Chan B. Lanyi A. Song H.K. Griesbach J. Simarro-Grande M. Poy F. Howie D. Sumegi J. Terhorst C. Eck M.J.

Gel pieces were digested with trypsin and desalted on a C18 packed pipette tip before being injected onto an Ultimate 3000 nano-HPLC (Dionex) system coupled to an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron). Samples were resolved on a 5-cm × 100-μm inner diameter picotip column (New Objective) that was packed in-house with Reprosil-Pur C18-AQ phase (Dr. Maisch). The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent acquisition mode. Peak lists were generated using DTAsupercharge and searched using Mascot (Matrixscience). Data were searched against the IPI human data base. To understand signaling by CD244 and the differences between mouse and human it is necessary to understand the contribution of both CD244 and CD2 as they share CD48 as a ligand in rodents. First, we needed a system in which we could manipulate the extracellular and intracellular interactions of CD2 and then ask how these are influenced by CD244. The aim is to understand how manipulation of a particular molecular interaction affects the functional outcome to interpret data from more complex biological systems. We chose to use a model that involved ligand engagement with antigen-specific stimulation of a CD4+ mouse T cell hybridoma and measuring IL-2 production. 2B4 Reay cells expressed very low levels of endogenous CD2, which facilitated detection of the effects of transduced single point mutants. Functional effects of extracellular and intracellular engagement of CD2 have been demonstrated in this hybridoma (37Wild M.K. Cambiaggi A. Brown M.H. Davies E.A. Ohno H. Saito T. van der Merwe P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As CD244 is not primarily expressed on CD4+ cells and not detectable on CD4+ hybridoma cells interpretation would not be complicated by the endogenous receptor as it is in experiments with CD8+ hybridoma cells. 3N. G. Clarkson, unpublished data. We established conditions where we could detect the effect of manipulation of extracellular interactions at the cell surface by blocking with well characterized mAbs and intracellular interactions using single point mutants of sites that have been shown to bind intracellular ligands. Biochemical data have shown that specific sites in the cytoplasmic region of CD2 are important for interactions with intracellular ligands (23Dustin M.L. Olszowy M.W. Holdorf A.D. Li J. Bromley S.

We transduced 2B4 Reay hybridoma cells with mouse CD2 alone or mutated forms of mouse CD2 with amino acid substitutions at position 288–289 (HH to DE) or 335–336 (PR to AA), which have previously been shown to be functionally important in humans (23Dustin M.L.

However, this did not provide a robust assay in which we could detect the effects of ligand engagement at the cell surface or within the cell. Interestingly cotransduction of CD2 and CD244 into these cells resulted in increased expression of CD244, by more than an order of magnitude (Fig. 1a). Additionally, we found that cotransduction of CD2 and CD244 into these cells elicited responses that we could show were altered by blocking mAbs and mutation of the cytoplasmic region of CD2. Cells expressing CD244 and either CD2 or mutated forms of CD2 were matched for surface expression of CD2, CD244 (Fig. 1b), and CD3 (data not shown). The cells were stimulated with peptide and CHO IEK cells or CHO IEK cells expressing mouse CD48. Antigen-specific IL-2 production by these cells was markedly reduced with the CD2 mutant (HH to DE) and the CD2 mutant (PR to AA) relative to wild type CD2 in response to both sets of CHO IEK cells (Fig. 1c and data not shown). As ligand-dependent effects of blocking mAbs (see below) could only be detected with CHO IEK cells expressing CD48 we continued with these as antigen presenting cells. Reduced responses by the CD2 cytoplasmic mutants are consistent with these sites being important for binding intracellular ligands under conditions where they have a positive effect on"
https://openalex.org/W2074536184,"The thrombin mutant W215A/E217A (WE) is a potent anticoagulant both in vitro and in vivo. Previous x-ray structural studies have shown that WE assumes a partially collapsed conformation that is similar to the inactive E* form, which explains its drastically reduced activity toward substrate. Whether this collapsed conformation is genuine, rather than the result of crystal packing or the mutation introduced in the critical 215-217 beta-strand, and whether binding of thrombomodulin to exosite I can allosterically shift the E* form to the active E form to restore activity toward protein C are issues of considerable mechanistic importance to improve the design of an anticoagulant thrombin mutant for therapeutic applications. Here we present four crystal structures of WE in the human and murine forms that confirm the collapsed conformation reported previously under different experimental conditions and crystal packing. We also present structures of human and murine WE bound to exosite I with a fragment of the platelet receptor PAR1, which is unable to shift WE to the E form. These structural findings, along with kinetic and calorimetry data, indicate that WE is strongly stabilized in the E* form and explain why binding of ligands to exosite I has only a modest effect on the E*-E equilibrium for this mutant. The E* --> E transition requires the combined binding of thrombomodulin and protein C and restores activity of the mutant WE in the anticoagulant pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2018213286,"Both interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 can bind to the shared receptor composed of the IL-4 receptor α chain and the IL-13 receptor α1 chain (IL-13Rα1); however, the mechanisms by which these ligands bind to the receptor chains are different, enabling the principal functions of these ligands to be different. We have previously shown that the N-terminal Ig-like domain in IL-13Rα1, called the D1 domain, is the specific and critical binding unit for IL-13. However, it has still remained obscure which amino acid has specific binding capacity to IL-13 and why the D1 domain acts as the binding site for IL-13, but not IL-4. To address these questions, in this study we performed mutational analyses for the D1 domain, combining the structural data to identify the amino acids critical for binding to IL-13. Mutations of Lys-76, Lys-77, or Ile-78 in c′ strand in which the crystal structure showed interaction with IL-13, and those of Trp-65 and Ala-79 adjacent to the interacting site, resulted in significant impairment of IL-13 binding, demonstrating that these amino acids generate the binding site. Furthermore, mutations of Val-35, Leu-38, or Val-42 at the N-terminal β-strand also resulted in loss of IL-13 binding, probably from decreased structural stability. None of the mutations employed here affected IL-4 binding. These results demonstrate that the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 acts as an affinity converter, through direct cytokine interactions, that allows the shared receptor to respond differentially to IL-4 and IL-13.

IL-4 binds to a heterodimeric complex composed of the IL-4R α chain (IL-4Rα) and the common γ chain (γc), or of IL-4Rα and the IL-13R α1 chain (IL-13Rα1), called type I or type II IL-4R, respectively (1.Izuhara K.

Immunol. 2000; 105: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, IL-13 binds to type II IL-4R, but not type I IL-4R. Therefore, type II IL-4R is also called IL-13R. This means that IL-4 and IL-13 share the same receptor, type II IL-4R·IL-13R, which explains why IL-4 and IL-13 exert similar activities. However, the principal functions of IL-4 and IL-13 are different. As type I IL-4R is mainly expressed on hematopoietic cells, IL-4 acts on these cells, inducing Th2 differentiation in T cells and immunoglobulin class switching to IgE in B cells (1.Izuhara K. Arima K. Kanaji S. Ohta S. Kanaji T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3.Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). In contrast, type II IL-4R·IL-13R expresses ubiquitously, including nonhematopoietic cells, and IL-13 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma by acting on these cells, including epithelial cells and fibroblasts (1.Izuhara K. Arima K. Kanaji S. Ohta S. Kanaji T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4.Wills-Karp M. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 202: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be said that the principal role of IL-4 is an immunoregulatory cytokine, whereas that of IL-13 is an effector cytokine (5.Junttila I.S. Mizukami K. Dickensheets H. Meier-Schellersheim M.

The assembly mechanism for the binding of either IL-4 or IL-13 to type II IL-4R·IL-13R is unique. IL-4 first binds to IL-4Rα with high affinity (Kd = 1 nm), followed by recruitment of IL-13Rα1 with low affinity. In contrast, IL-13 first binds to IL-13Rα1 with low affinity (Kd = 30–37 nm), and then the complex recruits IL-4Rα, forming a high affinity receptor (Kd = 0.03–0.4 nm (6.Andrews A.L. Holloway J.W.

This means that, although both IL-4 and IL-13 use IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1, the roles of IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1 as the primary or secondary binding unit are the opposite of those for IL-4 and IL-13. Furthermore, these differences in affinity between the ligand, the primary binding unit, and the secondary binding unit can result in that in nonhematopoietic cells on which IL-131 is expressed more abundantly than IL-4α, the number of the IL-13 receptor complex continues to rise as the IL-13 concentration increases, whereas the formation of the IL-4 receptor complex is saturated at a low IL-4 concentration. This can explain why IL-13 transduces stronger signals than IL-4 in nonhematopoietic cell such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts. We previously found that the N-terminal Ig-like domain in IL-13Rα1, called the D1 domain, is the specific and critical binding unit for IL-13, but not for IL-4, using the D1 domain-deleted IL-13Rα1 (8.Arima K.

LaPorte et al. recently described the crystal structure of the IL-13·IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα, showing that the c′ strand of the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 and the C-D strand of IL-13 generate an antiparallel β-sheet structure (7.LaPorte S.L.

Furthermore, this structural analysis showed that the polar bonds between IL-4 and IL-4Rα were diminished in the IL-13·IL-4Rα complex, possibly suggesting why IL-4Rα has high and no affinity with IL-4 and IL-13, respectively. These results confirmed that the unique assembly mechanism of type II IL-4R·IL-13R for IL-4 and IL-13 is dictated by the D1 domain and indicated that the c′ strand in the D1 domain is the binding site of IL-13Rα1 to IL-13. It is thought that IL-13Rα1 has evolved from γc, which does not have the extra Ig domain, acquiring the D1 domain probably from IL-2Rα or IL-15Rα (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A.

Immunity. 2003; 19: 159-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In other words, the acquisition of the D1 domain enables the cells to respond to IL-13 in addition to IL-4. In this sense, the D1 domain appears to be an affinity converter that has evolved differential interactions with IL-4 and IL-13 to respond to the two cytokines distinctly, based on receptor expression levels and cytokine concentration. Thus, the evolution of distinct interactions of D1 with IL-4 versus IL-13 is an unprecedented example of divergent evolution of function of the same structure. Interestingly, in the structural study, it was observed that the c′ strand of the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 can also generate an antiparallel β-sheet structure with IL-4 that appears similar to that of IL-13 (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), leaving open the question of whether it is energetically important for IL-13 but not IL-4, and whether direct interactions are required. From these studies, several questions remain unresolved. The structures did not make it clear if this differential effect is indirect, or through direct interaction with the cytokines. Are the c′ contacts with cytokines energetically important and distinct for IL-4 and IL-13? If this is the case, then the second question is which amino acid in the c′ strand has specific binding capacity to IL-13. The third question is why does this portion act as the binding site specific for IL-13, but not IL-4. To address these questions, we took advantage of the mutational approach for the D1 domain, combining data from the structural study, and identified the amino acids critical for binding to IL-13. Expression and purification of recombinant human IL-13 was performed as previously described (8.Arima K. Sato K. Tanaka G. Kanaji S. Terada T. Honjo E. Kuroki R. Matsuo Y. Izuhara K. J. Biol.

HEK 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin G. DND-39 cells transfected with the germ line ϵ promoter-luciferase gene (DND-39/Gϵ cells) were prepared and cultured, as described before (8.Arima K. Sato K. Tanaka G. Kanaji S. Terada T. Honjo E.

The mutated types of IL-13Rα1 were generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using mutation-incorporated oligonucleotides as the primers and pIRES1hyg-FLAG-hIL-13Rα1 as the templates. Plasmids were prepared encoding the wild type of hIL-4Rα (pcDNA3.1-hIL- 4Rα-myc/His). Transient transfection of the plasmids into HEK 293T cells was performed by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or by polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were transfected into DND-39/Gϵ cells using the Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), and stable transfected cells were maintained with a culture medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Expression of the receptors was confirmed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using anti-FLAG antibody (Ab, Sigma-Aldrich) or R-phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD124 Ab (BD Biosciences). The luciferase assay was performed as previously described (8.Arima K. Sato K. Tanaka G. Kanaji S. Terada T. Honjo E. Kuroki R. Matsuo Y. Izuhara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24915-24922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with various types of pIRES1hyg-FLAG-hIL-13Rα1, pME18S-STAT6, and pGL3-N4 × 8 (kind gifts of Dr. T. Sugahara, Asahi Kasei Pharma Corp., Fuji, Japan). pGL3-N4 × 8 has an eight-tandem-lined STAT6-responsible element (TTCNNNNGAA), as a promoter sequence of the firefly luciferase gene. The Renilla-luciferase reporter gene (phRL-Tk, Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. Forty-eight hours after transfection, HEK 293T cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13 for 6 h, followed by washing once by phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell lysates were applied to the Picagene Dual Luciferase assay kit (TOYO Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Iodination of IL-13 or IL-4 and the binding assay were performed as described previously with slight modifications (8.Arima K. Sato K. Tanaka G. Kanaji S. Terada T. Honjo E. Kuroki R. Matsuo Y.

In brief, 1 μg of IL-13 or IL-4 and 1 mCi of Na125I (MP Biomedicals, Costa, CA) in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline were incubated in an IODOGEN-precoated tube (Pierce) at 4 °C for 10 min. Radiolabeled IL-13 or IL-4 was purified by a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. The concentrations of [125I]IL-13 and [125I]IL-4 were quantified by self-displacement of IL-13Rα2-expressing DND-39 cells or parental DND-39 cells, respectively. After cells were incubated with various concentrations of [125I]IL-13 or [125I]IL-4 at 4 °C for 2.5 h, bound and free ligands were separated by centrifugation through an oil gradient, and their radioactivity was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined by counts in the presence of 100-fold unlabeled IL-13 or IL-4. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (8.Arima K. Sato K.

DND-39/Gϵ cells stably transfected with various kinds of IL-13Rα1 were stimulated with the indicated concentration of IL-4 or IL-13 at 37 °C for 10 min. The solubilized lysates or the immunoprecipitates from the lysates with anti-Tyk2 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with either anti-phosphotyrosyl STAT6 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), anti-STAT6 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-tyrosine Ab (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-Tyk2 Ab, followed by incubation with secondary Abs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The signals were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and LAS-1000PLUS (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The accessible surface area for ligand-binding and -unbinding structures of hIL-13Rα1 and the contact area between either IL-13 or IL-4 and hIL-13Rα1 were calculated by using the computer program Areaimol (11.Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5293) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite (12.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar), using atomic coordinates (PDB: 3bpo) of IL-13·IL-13Rα1 (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X.

In these calculations, default parameters for the van der Waals radii of 1.80, 1.65, 1.60, and 1.85 Å were used for C, N, O, and S, respectively. The 1.4-Å distance as a solvent proof was added to each atom location for accessible surface area calculation. To identify the critical residues in the D1 domain of hIL-13Rα1 for the IL-13 signals, we first generated four kinds of D1 domain-truncated types of hIL-13Rα1 and analyzed their IL-13 responses in HEK 293T cells (hIL-13Rα1ΔD1-(1–4), Fig. 1A). In this experiment, we stimulated hIL-13Rα1-transfected HEK 293T cells with 0.01 ng/ml IL-13, because endogenous IL-13Rα1 cannot transduce IL-13 signals with this concentration of IL-13, as we previously reported (8.Arima K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 24915-24922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). hIL-13Rα1ΔD1-1 lacking the N-terminal 32 amino acids showed luciferase activities similar to the wild type, whereas only a little activity was detected in hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–2 lacking the N-terminal 44 amino acids as well as hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–3/4 and hIL-13Rα1ΔD1 (Fig. 1B). The expression of all hIL-13Rα1ΔD1-(1–4) was confirmed by flow cytometry to be at the same level as the wild type and hIL-13Rα1ΔD1 (data not shown). These results suggested that the portion from the 33rd to the 44th amino acid in the a strand of the D1 domain of hIL-13Rα1 was critical for the IL-13 signals. To identify the amino acids critical for the IL-13 signals in the portion from the 33rd to the 44th amino acid in the a strand of the D1 domain, we next substituted each amino acid between the 33rd and 44th amino acids with Ala and analyzed their IL-13 responses in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2A). Among the Ala-substituted mutants, Leu-38 → Ala significantly diminished the luciferase activities, and Val-35 → Ala and Val-42 → Ala partially impaired these activities, whereas the other mutants showed activities similar to the wild type (Fig. 2B). All of the Ala-substituted mutants were confirmed by flow cytometry to be expressed at the same level as the wild type (data not shown). These results clearly demonstrated that Leu-38, and additionally Val-35 and Val-42, were critical amino acids in the transduction of the IL-13 signals. To investigate the importance of Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 of hIL-13Rα1 in the binding and signal transduction of IL-13, we generated DND-39/Gϵ cells stably expressing either Val-35 → Ala-, Leu-38 → Ala-, or Val-42 → Ala-harboring IL-13Rα1 and analyzed their abilities to bind to IL-13 and transduce the IL-13 signals. All of the DND-39/Gϵ transfectants used for the assays expressed almost the same level of the receptors (Fig. 3A). Binding to IL-13 was significantly impaired in Val-35 → Ala mutant compared with the wild type (Kd = ∼480 pm). No IL-13 binding was detected in Leu-38 → Ala, or in Val-42 → Ala mutants or D1 domain-deleted hIL-13Rα1, whereas binding activities to IL-4 were invariant in all of the mutants with the Kd of ∼54 pm (Fig. 3B). In accordance with the binding activity to IL-13, STAT6 activation by IL-13 was almost completely impaired in all Val-35 → Ala, Leu-38 → Ala, and Val-42 → Ala mutants (Fig. 3C). We then analyzed activation of Tyk2, a specific event for type II IL-4R·IL-13R (Fig. 3D). In response to IL-13, Leu-38 → Ala mutant completely diminished the activation of Tyk2, whereas both Val-35 → Ala and Val-42 → Ala mutants showed slight activation of Tyk2, compatible with the results of the luciferase activities (Fig. 2B), whereas IL-4 induced invariable bands in these mutants. Taking these results together, Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 were identified as crucial for IL-13 binding, subsequently for the IL-13 signals, whereas these amino acids were not involved in the IL-4 binding. Truncation mutagenesis as well as subsequent Ala-scanning mutagenesis clearly demonstrated that Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 are important for IL-13 binding. However, the crystal structure of the D1 domain in hIL-13Rα1 indicated that the side chains of Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 are buried between the β-sheets and are not involved in the direct IL-13 binding (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). This may suggest that the hydrophobic character of Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 is important for maintaining the structural stability of the D1 domain. To explore this possibility, the accessible surface area of the side chain of each amino acid residue of Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 was calculated based on structural information obtained by x-ray crystallography (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The accessible surface areas for the residues Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42 were calculated to be 0, 1.2, and 28.9A2, respectively, corresponding to only 0, 1.0, and 26% of the exposed surface area of the side chains, suggesting that both Val-35 and Leu-38 are completely buried (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the side chains of these hydrophobic residues (Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42), particularly Leu-38, may contribute to the stability needed to maintain the tertiary structure and consequently the ligand binding activity. The crystal structure showed that the ligand-receptor interaction between IL-13 and the D1 domain is a β-sheet-like interaction created by hydrogen bonding between the main-chain amide groups from Gln-74 to Glu-81 (major contributors are Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78) of the D1 domain and the region from Ala-86 to Glu-91 (major contributors are Asp-87, Lys-89, and Glu-91) of IL-13 (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The area of the contact region between IL-13 and the D1 domain was calculated to be ∼350 Å2. Hydrophobic interaction from the side chains in this region, particularly Lys-76 (92 Å2), Lys-77 (42 Å2), and Ile-78 (82 Å2), seems to assist the interaction between IL-13 and the D1 domain of receptor (Fig. 4B). To analyze the significance of Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78 in the c′ strand of the D1 domain, we generated two internal deleted mutants of hIL-13Rα1, hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–5 (deletion of Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78) and hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–6 (deletion of Ala-58, Ser-59, and Ser-60), and analyzed their responses to IL-13 (Fig. 5A). The crystal structure of the IL-13·IL-13Rα1 complex suggested that Ala-58, Ser-59, and Ser-60 would not be involved in the formation of the conformational structure of IL-13Rα1 (18.Wenzel S. Wilbraham D. Fuller R. Getz E.B. Longphre M. Lancet. 2007; 370: 1422-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–6 only slightly decreased binding activities compared with the wild type, whereas hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–5 completely diminished the activities (Fig. 5C). The expression of both hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–5 and hIL-13Rα1ΔD1–6 was the same as the wild type (Fig. 5B). These results strongly suggested that three amino acids, Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78 in the c′ strand of hIL-13Rα1, are involved the direct interaction with IL-13. To further identify the important residues in this region, we then substituted Trp-65, Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78 with Ala, and Ala-79 with charged or bulky amino acids, Asp or Tyr, based on the assumption from the crystal structure analysis, and analyzed the binding and signal transduction of IL-13 and IL-4 in these mutants. Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78 contributed the most to the contact with IL-13. Because Trp-65 and Ala-79 of the D1 domain are also located at the interface with IL-13, the substitution of these residues may affect the interaction with IL-13. The Trp-65 → Ala, Lys-76 → Ala, Lys-77 → Ala, Ile-78 → Ala, Ala-79 → Asp, and Ala-79 → Tyr mutants were all expressed at the same level as the wild type, as shown by flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). Binding activity of IL-13 was partially impaired in the Trp-65 → Ala mutant, whereas the Lys-76 → Ala, Lys-77 → Ala, Ile-78 → Ala, Ala-79 → Asp, and Ala-79 → Tyr mutants showed significant impairment of binding activities (Fig. 6B). In contrast, binding activity to IL-4 was not affected in these mutants (Fig. 6, C and D). In accordance with the IL-13 binding, the luciferase activity of IL-13 was slightly decreased in the Trp-65 → Ala mutant. The Lys-76 → Ala, Lys-77 → Ala, Ile-78 → Ala, Ala-79 → Asp, and Ala-79 → Tyr mutants showed significantly decreased activities at almost the same level as the mock transfectant (Fig. 6E). The luciferase activities of IL-4 were again invariant between the wild type and the mutants. It is of note that the substitutions of Ala-79 with two different bulky amino acids, Asp and Tyr, similarly decreased IL-13 luciferase activity, indicating that the bulky side chains, not the specific characteristics of the side chains in Asp and Tyr, contributed to inhibiting the IL-13 signals. Combined with the structural analysis of the IL-13·IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα complex, these functional studies clearly showed that the hydrophobic part of the side chains composed of Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78, a characteristic feature of the β strand, was the IL-13 recognition site. In this study, we identified the amino acids critical for binding to IL-13 using various IL-13Rα1 mutants, combining the data with structural study of the IL-13·IL-13Rα1·IL-4Rα complex. Although structural analysis of the ligand· receptor complex is a powerful approach to identify the critical region for ligand-receptor interaction, this method sometimes gives results for the identified ligand-receptor interaction site that are different from those yielded by the mutational approach. That is, the “structural” and “functional” binding epitopes are different, because it is very difficult to predict the energetics of interactions by inspection of structural data. This information can only be obtained by mutagenesis. For example, structural analysis showed that Phe-108 in IL-13 was strongly involved in receptor interaction at the D3 domain (site II interaction (7.LaPorte S.L. Juo Z.S. Vaclavikova J. Colf L.A. Qi X. Heller N.M. Keegan A.D. Garcia K.C. Cell. 2008; 132: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar)), whereas the substitution of Phe-108 with Ala did not show any measurable loss of function (13.Madhankumar A.B. Mintz A. Debinski W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43194-43205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The present mutational analysis solidified the finding by the structural study that three amino acids, Lys-76, Lys-77, and Ile-78, in the c′ strand of the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 form the recognition site with IL-13. This analysis also showed that three hydrophobic amino acids, Val-35, Leu-38, and Val-42, are critical for binding to IL-13, probably by maintaining the stability of the ternary structure of the D1 domain, which was not shown by the structural study. It is known that the cytokine receptor homologous region having the WSXWS motif is a characteristic determinant for the interaction between helical cytokines and their receptors (14.Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1864) Google Scholar). However, several cytokine receptors such as gp130 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor use the extra Ig domain for ligand binding in addition to the cytokine receptor homologous region (15.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 16.Tamada T. Honjo E. Maeda Y. Okamoto T. Ishibashi M. Tokunaga M. Kuroki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3135-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There are several ligand recognition schemes identified for Ig domains of cytokine receptors. One scheme is generation of a β-sheet-like structure by β strands of ligand and receptor, and another is hydrophobic interaction between ligand and receptor. gp130 uses the N and C termini of the Ig domain for generation of a β-sheet-like structure and hydrophobic interaction, respectively (15.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), whereas granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor binds to the ligand by hydrophobic interaction via N- and C-terminal portions of the Ig domain (16.Tamada T. Honjo E. Maeda Y. Okamoto T. Ishibashi M. Tokunaga M. Kuroki R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3135-3140Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The present and previous structural studies show that the ligand recognition manner of the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 is unique in that the middle portion (residues from 65 to 79) of the D1 domain makes a hydrophobic patch in the β-sheet-like structure interfacing with Met-33, Thr-88, Lys-89, Ile-90, and Glu-91 in IL-13 (Fig. 4B). Overall, from the structures of the IL-4 and IL-13 ternary complexes, it is difficult to understand the exact reason why the IL-13Rα1 D1 interaction with the cytokines is energetically critical for IL-13 binding but not IL-4. In both cases, the c′ strand of the D1 domain of IL-13Rα1 forms an antiparallel β-sheet with the F′-G′ loop of the cytokine in a rather “featureless” interface relatively devoid of deeply embedded and specific pairwise amino acid contacts, or obvious shape complementarity, as one sees, for instance, in the site I and site II interfaces. There is also extensive main-chain contact between the D1 c′ strand and the F′-G′ loop. We speculated from the crystal structures that the reason for the energetic differences could be related to an apparently more polar site III surface in the IL-4 complex (Thr-28, Asn-105, Gln-106, Ser-107, and Thr-108), versus a more hydrophobic surface in the IL-13 site III interface (Met-33, Thr-88, Lys-89, Ile-90, and Glu-91) that could generate binding energy through desolvation (Fig. 4, B and C). In either case, it is clear that even the IL-13 site III interface is weak in isolation, because we cannot see binding of an isolated IL-13Rα1 D1 domain with IL-13 (data not shown). Rather, the site III interaction is cooperative with sites I and II, supporting the notion that the higher energy site III in the IL-13 complex reflects a delicate energetic balance. Here, our mutational data support the assertion that the alkyl side chains of the c′ strand residues contribute binding energy to the interface through apolar van der Waals contacts that are diminished in the IL-4 site III (Fig. 6, B and D). Because of the importance of IL-13 in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma, several reagents targeting IL-13 are now being developed as therapeutic agents (1.Izuhara K. Arima K. Kanaji S. Ohta S. Kanaji T. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17.Holgate S.T. Polosa R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 8: 218-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It is of note that an IL-4 variant (pitrakinra, Aerovant) competitively inhibiting the biological activities of both IL-4 and IL-13 by occupying their receptors, improved asthmatic symptoms in phase 2a studies (18.Wenzel S. Wilbraham D. Fuller R. Getz E.B. Longphre M. Lancet. 2007; 370: 1422-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Our present findings about the specifics of the role of the D1 domain on the IL-13Rα1 signaling will help to develop a new or more efficient antagonist targeting IL-13Rα1. One possibility is to develop a neutralizing Ab or a low-molecular-weight compound targeting the binding site in the D1 domain. Thus, our present findings about the interaction between IL-13 and IL-13Rα1 give us not only basic knowledge about the association mechanism of the cytokine·receptor complex, but also clues useful in developing therapeutic agents. We thank Dr. Dovie R. Wylie for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2144334508,"Heterochromatin formation plays an important role in gene regulation and the maintenance of genome integrity. Here we present results from a study of the D. melanogaster gene vig, encoding an RNAi complex component and its homolog vig2 (CG11844) that support their involvement in heterochromatin formation and/or maintenance. Protein null mutations vigEP812 and vig2PL470 act as modifiers of Position Effect Variegation (PEV). VIG and Vig2 are present in polytene chromosomes and partially overlap with HP1. Quantitative immunoblots show depletion of HP1 and HP2 (large isoform) in isolated nuclei from the vigEP812 mutant. The vig2PL470 mutant strain demonstrates a decreased level of H3K9me2. Pull-down experiments using antibodies specific to HP1 recovered both VIG and Vig2. The association between HP1 and both VIG and Vig2 proteins depends on an RNA component. The above data and the developmental profiles of the two genes suggest that Vig2 may be involved in heterochromatin targeting and establishment early in development, while VIG may have a role in stabilizing HP1/HP2 chromatin binding during later stages."

This process depends on activation of a hierarchy of transcription factors. Although information is available regarding the mesodermal signals controlling pancreas development, little is known about the role of environmental factors such as nutrients, including glucose, that also may impact development. Previously, we showed that glucose plays an important and specific role in beta cell development by activating the transition of Neurogenin3-positive endocrine progenitors into beta cells. Here, we examined the implication of glucose metabolism and more precisely the role of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) to understand the mechanisms by which glucose regulates beta cell development. We have established an in vitro model of endocrine and exocrine cells development from embryonic day 13.5 rat pancreases in a manner that replicates in vivo pancreas development perfectly. Using this model, we tested the effect of selective inhibitors and activators of the HBP and found that the HBP has a modest effect on cell proliferation and exocrine cell differentiation. On the other hand, beta cell development is tightly controlled by the HBP. Specifically, HBP activators increase beta cell development, whereas inhibitors repress such development. Importantly, both the HBP and glucose control the same steps in beta cell development. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine cells develop during embryonic life from endodermal progenitors.

The mature pancreas contains two types of tissues: exocrine tissue, which is composed of acinar cells that secrete digestive enzymes into the intestine via a branched network of ductal cells, and endocrine islets of Langerhans cells that produce hormones such as insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells), somatostatin (delta cells), pancreatic polypeptide cells, and ghrelin (epsilon cells) (1.Slack J.M.

During development, the endodermal region committed to form the pancreas initially expresses the transcription factor Pdx-1 (pancreatic-duodenal homeobox 1), a marker of pancreatic progenitors also expressed in mature beta cells (5.Ohlsson H.

The basic helix-loop-helix factor Ngn3 (Neurogenin3) is then expressed in epithelial pancreatic progenitor cells prior to endocrine differentiation (8.Gradwohl G. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Guillemot F.

Thus, Ngn3 is a valuable marker for monitoring pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation. NGN3 controls the expression of NeuroD, which is another member of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family (10.Huang H.P. Liu M. El-Hodiri H.M. Chu K. Jamrich M. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3292-3307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Mice that lack NeuroD exhibit strongly perturbed islet development, demonstrating the importance of this transcription factor for development of a normal endocrine pancreas (11.Naya F.J. Huang H.P. Qiu Y. Mutoh H. DeMayo F.J. Leiter A.B. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2323-2334Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Pancreas development is known to be controlled by signals derived from tissues that contact the endodermal region that gives rise to the pancreas (1.Slack J.M. Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such as the notochord (12.Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Melton D.A. Development. 1997; 124: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the dorsal aorta (13.Lammert E. Cleaver O. Melton D. Science. 2001; 294: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), and the pancreatic mesenchyme (14.Scharfmann R. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, animal models of intrauterine growth retardation have also demonstrated the importance of uterine nutrition on pancreas development (15.Bréant B. Gesina E. Blondeau B. Horm. Res. 2006; 65: 98-104PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Remacle C. Dumortier O. Bol V. Goosse K. Romanus P. Theys N. Bouckenooghe T. Reusens B. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2007; 9: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but less is known regarding the importance of nutrients in controlling its development. Notably, these studies were performed in vivo, limiting the ability to assess the molecular processes that restrict pancreatic development. Moreover, an in vivo approach does not permit detailed analysis of the precise effects of specific nutrients on pancreatic development. Previously, we developed an in vitro model of beta cell development using rat embryonic pancreas that perfectly mimics in vivo pancreatic development (17.Attali M. Stetsyuk V. Basmaciogullari A. Aiello V. Zanta-Boussif M.A. Duvillie B. Scharfmann R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). With this model, we have shown that glucose controls beta cell development by activating expression of NeuroD, which is a direct target of NGN3 (18.Guillemain G. Filhoulaud G. Da Silva-Xavier G. Rutter G.A. Scharfmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15228-15237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this study, we built upon these findings and attempted to determine how glucose exerts such effects on beta cell development. Typically, glucose is transported inside the cell and phosphorylated into glucose-6-phosphate. Next, it enters the glycolysis pathway to provide energy. However, 2–5% of glucose is directed into the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to promote protein glycosylation (19.Bouché C. Serdy S. Kahn C.R. Goldfine A.B. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 807-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) is the first enzyme in the HBP. GFAT transfers the amide group from glutamine to fructose-6-phosphate to form glucosamine-6-phosphate, a precursor of uridine diphosphate-GlcNAc. The latter is the major substrate for protein N- and O-glycosylation. When N-glycosylation is constitutive, O-glycosylation is a process (similar to phosphorylation) regulated by O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) and β-d-N-acetylglucosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase), which are responsible for O-glycosylation and de-O-glycosylation mechanisms, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 20.Hart G.W.

Here, we perturbed the HBP with specific inhibitors and activators using our in vitro model of beta cell development from pancreatic progenitors and demonstrated that the HBP controls specific steps of pancreatic beta cell development. Pregnant Wistar rats were purchased from CERJ (Le Genest, St. Isle, France). The first day post-coitum was designated embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Pregnant female rats at 13.5 days of gestation were killed by CO2 asphyxiation in compliance with the French Animal Care Committee's guidelines. Dorsal pancreatic buds from E13.5 rat embryos were dissected as described previously (22.Miralles F. Battelino T. Czernichow P. Scharfmann R. J.

Pancreases were laid on 0.45-μm filters (Millipore, St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) at the air-medium interface in Petri dishes containing RPMI 1640 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), HEPES (10 mmol/liter), nonessential amino acids (1×; Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) (17.Attali M.

The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2. d-glucose, GlcNAc, azaserine, glucosamine, benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (BADGP; Sigma-Aldrich), 3-(2-adamantanylethyl)-2-[(4-chlorophenyl)-azamethylene]-4-oxo-1,3-thiazaperhyd roine-6-carboxylic acid (ST045849; TimTec, Newark, DE), and O-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene amino N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc; Toronto Research Chemical, North York, Canada) were used at the indicated concentrations. The medium was changed every other day. For cell proliferation assays, 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium during the last hour of culture. The tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, pre-embedded in low gelling agarose, and embedded in paraffin. All of the sections (4 μm thick) of each pancreatic explant were collected and processed for immunohistochemical analysis as described previously (23.Duvillié B. Attali M. Bounacer A. Ravassard P.

Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: mouse anti-insulin, 1/2,000; rabbit anti-amylase, 1/300 (both from Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-PDX-1 (25.Duvillie B. Attali M. Aiello V. Quemeneur E.

The fluorescent secondary antibodies used included fluorescein anti-rabbit 1/200 and Texas Red anti-mouse antibody 1/200 (both from Jackson Immunoresearch, Suffolk, UK) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit antibody 1/400 (Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained in blue with Hoechst 33342 (0.3 μg/ml; Invitrogen). NGN3 detection was performed as previously described (18.Guillemain G. Filhoulaud G. Da Silva-Xavier G. Rutter G.A.

Photographs were taken using a fluorescence microscope (Leitz DMRB; Leica, Rueil-Malmaison, France). All of the sections from each pancreatic rudiment were digitized using cooled, three-charge coupled device cameras (C5810 or C7780; Hamamatsu, Middlesex, NJ). On every image, the surface area of each staining was quantified using ImageJ 1.34s and summed to obtain the total surface area/explant in mm2 as previously described (18.Guillemain G. Filhoulaud G.

To quantify proliferation of early PDX-1-positive pancreatic progenitors, we counted the frequency of BrdUrd-positive nuclei among 2,000 early PDX-1-positive progenitors/rudiment. To quantify the absolute numbers of NGN3-positive endocrine progenitors, all sections of each pancreatic rudiment were digitized, and on every section, the number of NGN3-positive cells was counted (18.Guillemain G.

The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Total RNA was extracted from pools of three pancreases using an RNeasy Microkit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using Superscript reagents (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed with the 7300 fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Paris, France). Oligonucleotide sequences are available upon request. Peptidylpropyl isomerase A was used as endogenous control. E16.5 pancreas cDNA was used as calibrator sample. The data were analyzed by the comparative cycle threshold method and presented as the fold change in gene expression normalized to an E16.5 calibrator that equals a value of one (18.Guillemain G. Filhoulaud G. Da Silva-Xavier G. Rutter G.A. Scharfmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15228-15237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At least four pools of explants were analyzed per condition, and the results are expressed as the means plus S.E. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test when only two sets of data were compared. For larger analysis, a nonparametric Kurskal & Wallis test was performed, followed by a Mann-Whitney test. When E13.5 rat pancreases are dissected and cultured on filters floating at the air-medium interface, acinar and endocrine cells develop in a manner that replicates in vivo pancreatic development (17.Attali M. Stetsyuk V. Basmaciogullari A. Aiello V. Zanta-Boussif M.A. Duvillie B. Scharfmann R. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 1248-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To define the role of HBP in beta cell differentiation, we used this rat pancreas model to examine the impact of treatment with azaserine, a competitive inhibitor of GFAT, the first rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP pathway (Fig. 1A). Pancreases were cultured in the presence of 10 mm glucose with and without 10 μm azaserine. After 7 days of culture, azaserine treatment had not modified the size of the tissue (Fig. 1, B and C). However, it slightly but significantly decreased acinar cell differentiation as indicated by a 1.6-fold decrease in the surface area occupied by amylase-positive cells compared with control culture (Fig. 1, B and C). It also decreased Ptf1a, Carboxypeptidase A, and Amylase mRNA expression by 34, 47, and 41%, respectively (data not shown). Moreover, azaserine strongly decreased beta cell development, indicated by a 5-fold decrease in the surface area occupied by insulin-positive cells compared with the control culture (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, azaserine had a dose-dependent effect on beta cell development. Specifically, when pancreases were cultured for 7 days in the presence of 10 mm glucose at increasing concentrations of azaserine (from 0 to 10 μm), there was a progressive decrease in Insulin mRNA steady state levels as measured by real time PCR (Fig. 1D). Pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells derive from early progenitors expressing the transcription factor PDX-1. A simple explanation for decreased development of both acinar and beta cell mass in the presence of azaserine could be that azaserine either induces apoptosis or reduces the proliferative rate of the PDX-1-positive progenitors. However, neither did azaserine treatment increase the rate of apoptosis as determined using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling method (data not shown), nor did it decrease proliferation of Pdx-1-positive progenitors as determined after BrdUrd incorporation. In fact, proliferation of PDX-1-positive precursors increased slightly in the presence of azaserine (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Azaserine treatment prevents the development of NGN3-positive endocrine progenitor cells.

Scale bar, 100 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously we showed that glucose controls beta cell differentiation by promoting the transition between Ngn3 and NeuroD (18.Guillemain G. Filhoulaud G. Da Silva-Xavier G. Rutter G.A. Scharfmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15228-15237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then checked to see whether azaserine blocked such a transition between Ngn3 and NeuroD during beta cell development. To this end, we cultured pancreases with 10 mm glucose with and without 10 μm azaserine and used real time PCR to quantify Ngn3, NeuroD, and Insulin expression before treatment (day 0) and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after treatment. At all time points analyzed, Ngn3 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in the presence of azaserine and remained low throughout the culture period (Fig. 2B). This decrease in mRNA was paralleled by a 3.8-fold decrease in the number of endocrine progenitors expressing the NGN3 protein (Fig. 2C). Consequently, expression of downstream targets such as NeuroD, Insulin (Fig. 2B), and MafA and MafB (data not shown) was dramatically decreased after treatment with azaserine (about 60% decrease for NeuroD, 66% for Insulin, 47% for MafA, and 40% for MafB). Collectively, these results indicate that complete inhibition of the HBP blocks beta cell development in the presence of glucose. Because azaserine acts on the HBP upstream of Ngn3, it was not possible with this protocol to determine whether HBP controls the transition between Ngn3 and NeuroD. To further delineate the role of HBP in beta cell differentiation, we compared the effects of glucose and GlcNAc, which is a direct substrate of the HBP, on pancreatic development in E13.5 pancreases after 7 days in culture. Neither glucose nor GlcNAc affected pancreatic growth or acinar cell development (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, GlcNAc mimicked the inductive effect of glucose on beta cell development; specifically, 15 times more insulin-positive cells developed after GlcNAc exposure compared with cultures grown in the absence of glucose (Fig. 3, A and B). To rule out the possibility that effect of GlcNAc was due to an osmotic change, we compared the effect of 50 mm GlcNAc to 50 mml-glucose, a nontransported sugar. After 7 days of culture in the presence of such sugars, Insulin and Amylase expression were analyzed by real time PCR and compared with pancreases developed in the absence of added glucose. Amylase expression remained unchanged in all culture conditions, whereas Insulin expression was induced by 50 mm GlcNAc but not by 50 mml-glucose (data not shown). Next, to determine whether GlcNAc and glucose control the same step of pancreatic differentiation, we cultured pancreases and analyzed, using real time PCR, expression of Ngn3, NeuroD, and Insulin before exposure (day 0) and after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days in culture with and without 10 mm glucose and 50 mm GlcNAc. Overall, the expression profile of Ngn3 was similar in all culture conditions. Interestingly, the Ngn3 mRNA steady state level was slightly but significantly increased at day 3 of culture with GlcNAc compared with the other culture conditions (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the number of NGN3-positive cells was also higher on day 3 of GlcNAc culture (data not shown). Importantly, both glucose and GlcNAc induced an increase in the level of the NGN3-target NeuroD (Fig. 3C). Consequently, glucose and GlcNAc also induced Insulin expression (Fig. 3C). When embryonic pancreases were cultured for 7 days with GlcNAc at concentrations ranging from 0 to 50 mm, real time PCR showed that the Insulin mRNA level significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of GlcNAc (Fig. 3D). However, there was no concurrent effect on acinar cell development (Fig. 3, A and B, and data not shown), indicating that activation of the HBP only selectively affected pancreatic endocrine cell development. GlcNAc is not only a substrate of the HBP, but also a hexokinase activity inhibitor (27.Cárdenas M.L. Rabajille E. Niemeyer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, to validate that the positive effect of GlcNAc on beta cell development was due to a specific activation of the HBP, we compared the effects of glucose and glucosamine, a specific substrate of the HBP pathway (Fig. 1A) (28.Wells L. Hart G.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), on the beta cell differentiation process. After 7 days of culture, neither glucose nor glucosamine (1 mm) affected pancreatic size or acinar cell differentiation (Fig. 4, A and B). However, both glucose and glucosamine increased beta cell development (Fig. 4, A and B). Such beta cells developed with glucosamine express many of the same markers found in mature beta cells, such as the transcription factor PDX-1 and the proconvertase PCSK1 (Fig. 4C), as was the case with GlcNAc (data not shown). The HBP promotes O-glycosylation of proteins by OGT (29.Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because BADGP is an inhibitor of OGT, we tested its effect on pancreatic cell development. Pancreases were cultured with 10 mm glucose alone or supplemented with 5 mm BADGP for 7 days, and acinar and beta cell differentiation was analyzed immunohistochemically. BADGP treatment did not affect either the size of the tissue or acinar cell development, but it caused a 2-fold decrease in beta cell development (Fig. 5, A and B). Next, we analyzed by real time PCR the expression of Ngn3, NeuroD, Insulin, MafA, and MafB before treatment (day 0) and after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days in culture with 10 mm glucose alone or supplemented with BADGP, to determine which step in the beta cell differentiation process was affected by BADGP. The addition of BADGP treatment did not modify Ngn3 expression (Fig. 5C), but it decreased expression of both NeuroD and Insulin (Fig. 5C). MafA and MafB expression was reduced by 46 and 67%, respectively (data not shown). To further support the results obtained with BADGP, we repeated the experiments with ST04584, another OGT inhibitor. Treatment with ST045849 at 20 μm for 7 days mimicked the effects observed with BADGP; neither Ngn3 expression nor acinar cell development were modified upon ST045849 treatment (Fig. 5C, and data not shown), whereas NeuroD and Insulin expression decreased (Fig. 5C). Thus, cultures treated with glucose plus OGT inhibitors gave rise to a phenotype resembling the one found in cultures grown in the absence of glucose. Thus far, our results indicate that inhibition of OGT blocks beta cell differentiation after Ngn3 activation but before NeuroD is targeted. Protein O-glycosylation by OGT is counteracted by the deglycosylating enzyme O-GlcNAcase (28.Wells L. Hart G.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm that O-glycosylation plays a role in beta cell differentiation, we tested whether treatment with PUGNAc, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, activates beta cell development. We cultured pancreases for 7 days in the absence of added glucose with and without 10 μm PUGNAc. PUGNAc treatment did not affect the size of the tissue or acinar cell differentiation, but it increased beta cell mass 3.5-fold (Fig. 6, A and B). We then analyzed expression of Ngn3, NeuroD, Insulin, MafA, and MafB using real time PCR, before (day 0) and after 1, 3, 5, and 7 days in culture to determine how PUGNAc treatment affects beta cell development. PUGNAc did not modify Ngn3 expression, but it induced NeuroD and Insulin expression (Fig. 6C). MafA and MafB expression was also induced by 3.6- and 4.4-fold, respectively (data not shown). However, PUGNAc did not increase Insulin expression to the same degree as treatment with glucose alone. In fact, even when the culture medium is not supplemented with glucose, the glucose concentration in the medium is ∼1 mm because of the addition of fetal calf serum. Consequently, we compared the effect of PUGNAc alone and in combination with glucose at concentrations of 1, 2, and 10 mm. As shown in Fig. 6D, increasing glucose concentrations enhanced the effects of PUGNAc on beta cell development. Pancreatic development during prenatal life is a tightly regulated process, and many signals have been implicated in its control (reviewed in Ref. 30.Jørgensen M.C. Ahnfelt-Rønne J. Hald J. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Hecksher-Sørensen J. Endocr. Rev. 2007; 28: 685-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Specifically, pancreas development is initially controlled by fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and activin βB produced by the notochord (12.Kim S.K. Hebrok M. Melton D.A.

Three groups of stonechats (Saxicola torquata) from (I) strongly migrating, (II) weakly migrating and (III) non-migrating populations were experimentally infected with HPAIV H5N1. The different bird groups of this insectivorous passerine species were infected in autumn, when the migrating populations clearly exhibit migratory restlessness. Following infection, all animals succumbed to the disease from 3 through 7 days post inoculation. Viral shedding, antigen distribution in tissues, and survival time did not differ between the three populations. However, notably, endothelial tropism of the HPAIV infection was exclusively seen in the group of resident birds. In conclusion, our data document for the first time the high susceptibility of an insectivorous passerine species to H5N1 infection, and the epidemiological role of these passerine birds is probably limited due to their high sensitivity to HPAIV H5N1 infection. Despite pronounced inherited differences in migratory status, the groups were generally indistinguishable in their susceptibility, survival time, clinical symptoms and viral shedding. Nevertheless, the migratory status partly influenced pathogenesis in the way of viral tropism."
