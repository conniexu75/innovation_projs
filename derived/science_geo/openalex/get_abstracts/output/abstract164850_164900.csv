Numerous xenobiotic and biological compounds are known to interact with AhR, but it remains an orphan receptor, because its physiological ligand is unknown. We identified AhR ligands in human urine using a yeast AhR signaling assay and then characterized their properties. Two ligands, indirubin and indigo, were both present at average concentrations of ∼0.2 nm in the urine of normal donors. Indirubin was also detected in fetal bovine serum and contributed half of the total AhR ligand activity. The activities of indirubin and indigo were comparable with or more potent than that of the archetypal ligand, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, in yeast AhR activation assays. We suggest that the endogenous levels and potencies of indirubin and indigo are such that they activate AhR-mediated signaling mechanisms in vivo.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator fetal bovine serum cyclin-dependent kinase high pressure liquid chromatography AhR,1 also called the dioxin receptor, is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is present in most cell and tissue types of the body (1Pohjanvirta R. Tuomisto J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 483-549PubMed Google Scholar). AhR-mediated signaling is required for potent xenobiotic ligands such as TCDD and polychlorinated biphenyls to produce toxic responses (2Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab.

Toxic effects that are linked to xenobiotic AhR ligand exposures in animals include cancers, reproductive impairment, endometriosis, birth defects, and immunological impairment (4Huff J. Lucier G.

The toxic potential of xenobiotic AhR ligands is currently a major concern for regulatory agencies that are responsible for protecting public and environmental health. Although numerous xenobiotic ligands for AhR have been identified, the AhR is considered to be an orphan receptor, because its physiological ligand(s) and its function are not known.

Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1561-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) interact with AhR to produce activation or inhibition of signal transduction. In general, the low levels, lack of potency, and restricted distribution of these compounds make them unlikely candidates as major regulators of AhR signaling in most tissue types. We reasoned that human urine might be a good place to search for endogenous AhR ligands, and we developed a methodology to detect and isolate such compounds. Blue rayon was kindly provided by Dr. Hayatsu (Okayama University, Okayama City, Japan). General chemicals, essentially analytical grade, were purchased from Wako (Kyoto, Japan). TCDD was purchased from CIL (Andover, MA, USA). Indigo and β-glucuronidase were purchased from Sigma. Indirubin was synthesized as described in Hoessel et al. (14Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J.A. Nobel M.E.M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Indigo and indirubin were further purified by HPLC before use. The assay procedure was essentially as described by Miller (15Miller C.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 160: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The yeast strain YCM3 was grown overnight at 30 °C in synthetic glucose medium lacking tryptophan. Test chemicals (dissolved in Me2SO), 5 µl of the overnight culture, and 200 µl of synthetic medium containing 2% galactose were mixed in a 96-well microplate with subsequent incubation for 18 h at 30 °C. The cell densities were determined by reading the absorbance at 595 nm. 10 µl of each cell suspension was added to 140 µl of Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% sarcosyl, adjusted to pH 7), and the reaction was started by adding 50 µl of o-nitrophenol-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml solution in Z-buffer) with subsequent incubation for 60 min at 37 °C. Absorbances of the β-galactosidase assays were read at 405 nm. β-Galactosidase activity (referred to as lacZ units) was calculated by the following formula: absorbance at 405 nm × 1000/(absorbance at 595 nm × ml of cell suspension added × min of reaction time). TCDD equivalent concentration was calculated from the dose-response curve of TCDD. Human urine was collected from healthy male volunteers. The urine (5 liters per batch) was treated with H2SO4 (final concentration 0.5 N) at 60 °C for 1 h followed by neutralization with NaOH. Blue rayon (5 g) was added to the 5 liters of urine and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The blue rayon was removed from urine, washed with water, dried, and extracted twice with 200 ml of methanol:ammonia (50:1, v/v). The extract was evaporated to dryness and then dissolved in 2 ml of Me2SO. The urine sample concentrated by absorption to blue rayon was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column (5.0 × 20.0 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with methanol (1.5 ml/min). The fractions at elution volume of 615–720 ml were collected and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in a small volume of Me2SO and applied to a reversed-phase column (µ BONDASPHERE 15-µ C18, ¢19 × 150 mm; Waters Corp., Milford, MA), eluted at a flow rate of 5 ml/min with 80% methanol/water (v/v) for purification of the AhR ligands. Urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers and were treated immediately after excretion as follows. Urine was passed through a glass filter, and 100 ml of the filtrate was then passed through a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Waters). The cartridge was washed with 20 ml of water and 10 ml of 50% (v/v) methanol/water. Indirubin and indigo were eluted with 5 ml of Me2SO followed by the evaporation to dryness by centrifugal concentrator. The residue was dissolved in 100 µl of Me2SO and injected to an analytical reversed-phase column (symmetry C18/5 µm, ¢4.6 × 250 mm; Waters), eluted with 70% (v/v) methanol/water at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The fractions collected every min were evaporated to dryness followed by dissolving in 50 µl of Me2SO. The yeast assay was carried out on the samples to estimate the AhR ligand activity of the fractions corresponding to the retention time of indigo and indirubin. The recovery of the standard indigo and indirubin using this method was over 95%. Dilutions of indirubin and indigo standards were also tested at the same time to generate the standard curves. FBS was purchased from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Indirubin and indigo in FBS were measured under the same method except for the HPLC condition. We used an analytical reversed-phase column (Wakosil-II-5C18, ¢4.6 × 250 mm; Wako, Japan), eluted with the following gradient system of methanol in water: 0–20 min, linear gradient of 65–100%; 20–40 min, 100% at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. AhR ligand activity in human urine was assessed with a reporter gene assay using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YCM3, in which the human AhR and ARNT genes were co-expressed. Ligand-dependent activation of AhR leads to formation of a AhR/ARNT heterodimer that, in turn, stimulates transcriptional activation of a lacZ reporter plasmid in this assay (Fig.1A). Thus, AhR ligand activity in urine fractions can be detected and quantified by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Human urine collected from healthy volunteers was concentrated with the planar-compound specific absorbent blue rayon (16Hayatsu H. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 37-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The yeast assay revealed that human urine contains AhR ligand(s), and their activity was observed even in unconcentrated levels (concentration factor = 1) (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of urine with β-glucuronidase significantly increased the AhR ligand activity (10-fold), and treatment with H2SO4 dramatically raised the activity (1,000-fold). These results suggested the presence of the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of the ligands. It is also possible that ligand precursors were present in urine and that acid treatment process caused the formation of the ligands. Human urine treated with H2SO4 was concentrated by blue rayon and subjected to fractionation by HPLC. Each fraction was assayed for AhR ligand activity by the yeast assay. Fig. 1 Cshows the HPLC elution profile, along with absorbance (540 nm) and AhR ligand activity, of each fraction. Two major active fractions with retention times of 9–11 and 17–22 min were observed. The AhR ligand activity in these two fractions accounted for 5 and 90%, respectively, of the total activity. The two absorbance peaks (540 nm) corresponding to the active fractions were designated as B1 (blue compound 1) and R1 (red compound 1), respectively (Fig. 1 D). To investigate whether these compounds were present in untreated human urine, 5 liters of untreated urine was concentrated using blue rayon and analyzed by HPLC with a photodiode array detector. The UV-visible spectral absorption patterns showed clear peaks that corresponded to those of B1 and R1 (data not shown). Moreover, 100 ml of untreated fresh urine was concentrated using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge instead of blue rayon, injected to HPLC, fractionated every 1 min, and activity was followed using the yeast AhR assay. The major AhR ligand activity was observed in the fractions that eluted at the same time as B1 and R1 (Fig. 1 E). These results indicated that B1 and R1 were also present in untreated fresh human urine, and the dominant AhR ligand in human urine was R1. R1 was extracted from 120 liters of acid-treated urine and purified by HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”), yielding about 0.3 mg of pure R1. The electron impact mass spectrum of R1 exhibited a molecular ion peak at m/z 262 and two fragment ion peaks atm/z 205 and 234 (Fig.2A). Subsequent high resolution mass spectrometry indicated the molecular formula to be C16H10N2O2 (molecular weight = 262.0740, calculated as 262.0742). Fig. 2 Bshows the presence of 10 protons in the molecule as indicated by the1H NMR spectrum of R1 in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide. This is in agreement with the data from the high resolution mass spectrometry. By 1H NMR and high resolution mass spectroscopy, the structure of R1 was identified as indirubin (17Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. De Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The HPLC elution profile and the UV-visible absorbance spectrum of synthetic indirubin (14Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J.A. Nobel M.E.M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) were identical to those of R1, providing further support for the assignment of R1 as indirubin. Moreover, the HPLC elution profile and the UV spectrum of B1 were identical to those of indigo, which is an isomer of indirubin. We conclude that the major AhR ligands present in the acid-treated human urine are indigo (B1) and indirubin (R1), respectively. Indigo is one of the oldest dyes known to mankind and has been used since the Bronze Age (∼4000 B.C.). Indigo is the dark blue pigment used to dye the denim of blue jeans and other fabrics and is produced by fermentation of plant material from Isatis tinctoria,Indigofera tinctoria, and Polygonum tinctorium.Indirubin is a common pink colored by-product of indigo synthesis (17Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. De Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Fig. 3shows the AhR ligand activity of pure indirubin and indigo in the yeast AhR assay. The EC50values of indirubin, indigo, and TCDD were 0.2, 5, and 9 nm, respectively. It is surprising that the activity of indigo was as strong as that of TCDD. More surprisingly, indirubin was ∼ 50 times more potent than TCDD as a ligand in the yeast assay. The relative potencies of indirubin and indigo in the yeast AhR assay are reasonable based on the reported K d values of 12 and 2 nm, respectively, that were determined in AhR ligand binding assays using rat liver cytosol (18Rannug U. Bramstedt H. Nilsson U. Mutat. Res. 1992; 282: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). No data regarding the binding affinity of indirubin and indigo are presently available for the human AhR, which was used in our yeast assays. Indirubin and indigo have been found in the urine of patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia, porphyrinuria, and purple urine bag syndrome (19Blanz J. Ehninger G. Zeller K.P. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1989; 64: 145-156PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jackson A.H. Jenkins R.T. Grinstein M. Ferramola de Sancovich A.M. Sancovich H.A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 15: 245-252Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), but they have never been reported in urine from normal donors until now. We measured the concentrations of indirubin and indigo in urine that was processed within 15 min after excretion to minimize the potential effects of bacterial action (21Sapira J.D. Somani S. Shapiro A.P. Scheib E.T. Reihl W. Metabolism. 1971; 20: 474-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

FBS was concentrated by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge, fractionated every 0.5 min by HPLC and then each fraction was tested by yeast AhR assay (Fig. 4). Two major peaks were observed. According to their retention time, one was identified as indirubin, but the other was unknown. Indigo was not detected. Indirubin was present at the concentration of 0.07 nm and accounted for half of the total AhR activity of the FBS. The endogenous production of the indirubin and indigo in the human body was expected by the previous works from Gillam et al. (17Gillam E.M.J. Notley L.M. Cai H. De Voss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13817-13824Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 22Gillam E.M.J. Aguinaldo A.M.A. Notley L.M. Kim D. Mundkowski R.G. Volkov A.A. Arnold F.H. Souek P. DeVoss J.J. Guengerich F.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999; 265: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They found that human cytochrome P450s 2A6, 2C19, and 2E1 catalyzed the formation of indoxyl and isatin from indole, which could then undergo dimerization to form indigo and indirubin. In Fig. 1 B, we showed that treatment of urine with sulfuric acid dramatically raised the yields of the ligand activity. Two possible precursors of the active ligand(s) are the sulfate conjugates of indoxyl and isatin. It is possible that these compounds condense to form indigo and indirubin after sufuric acid treatment. Conjugates of indirubin and indigo are also candidates as precursors of the active ligand(s). Although the sulfate conjugate of indoxyl (indican) is a well known component of urine, we presently do not have any information about the concentrations of istatin, indigo, and indirubin conjugates in urine or serum. However, the glucuronidase-treatment experiment suggests that a considerable portion of the ligands in urine exist as glucuronides. Future studies will be directed toward understanding the nature and concentrations of the ligand precursor(s) in urine and serum, as well as the intracellular concentrations, conjugation status, and bioactivity of indigo and indirubin in cells and tissues. Because the levels of indirubin in human urine and FBS were high enough to activate the AhR, we suspect that indirubin is an endogenous activator of AhR and may play a regulatory role in vivo.Indirubin may act to regulate cellular proliferation. Indirubin-mediated activation of AhR may produce an arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle via inhibition of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (23Ge N.-L. Elferink C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22708-22713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24Puga A. Barnes S.J. Dalton T.P. Chang C.-Y. Knudsen E.S. Maier M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2943-2950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) and by transcriptional induction of p27Kip1, an inhibitor of CDK4,6-cyclin D1 and CDK2-cyclin E (25Kolluri S.K. Weiss C. Koff A. Gottlicher M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1742-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, indirubin also inhibits several CDKs and other kinases directly (14Hoessel R. Leclerc S. Endicott J.A. Nobel M.E.M. Lawrie A. Tunnah P. Leost M. Damiens E. Marie D. Marko D. Niederberger E. Tang W. Eisenbrand G. Meijer L. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Thus, indirubin levels may control the cell cycle via the AhR pathway and by indirect and direct inhibition of the CDK pathway. Although further studies are needed to clarify the role of indirubin in these pathways, the indirubin concentrations required for AhR activation appear to be lower than those needed to inhibit kinase activity. Thus, the dominant regulatory pathway may be because of indirubin-AhR interactions. In conclusion, we have identified two potent endogenous AhR ligands, indigo and indirubin, from human urine and bovine serum. Given their potency as ligands and their concentration in human urine and FBS, we propose that these AhR ligands play several important regulatory roles in cells. Further study of these endogenous ligands may reveal the physiological role(s) of AhR and further our understanding of the toxic xenobiotics such as TCDD. Finally, the coupling of yeast reporter assays analogous to the one above with fractionation and analytical characterization of biological materials, such as urine, can provide a fruitful methodology for uniting parental ligands with their orphan receptors."

After ligand binding, a two-step proteolytic cleavage releases the intracellular part of the receptor which translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator. Although Notch-induced transcription of genes has been reported extensively, its endogenous nuclear form has been seldom visualized. We report that the nuclear intracellular domain of Notch1 is stabilized by proteasome inhibitors and is a substrate for polyubiquitination in vitro.

We isolated human and murine counterparts of SEL-10 and investigated the role of a dominant-negative form of this protein, deleted of the F-box, on Notch1 stability and activity. This molecule could stabilize intracellular Notch1 and enhance its transcriptional activity but had no effect on inactive membrane-anchored forms of the receptor. We then demonstrated that SEL-10 specifically interacts with nuclear forms of Notch1 and that this interaction requires a phosphorylation event.

The Notch gene, first identified inDrosophila melanogaster, encodes a 300-kDa type I integral membrane protein. Notch1, the most extensively studied of the four mammalian Notch molecules, contains 36 epidermal growth factor-like repeats and three Lin12/Notch repeats in its extracellular part; the intracellular part is composed of three putative nuclear localization signals (NLS)1, six ankyrin repeats, and a C-terminal PEST domain. Notch1 activation involves a series of proteolytic steps. A constitutive cleavage by a furin-like convertase first takes place in the trans-Golgi network and is required for cell surface expression of a functional receptor (3Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C.

Indeed, very low amounts of nuclear Notch are sufficient for CSL-dependent transcription, and the presence of nuclear Notch is often detected indirectly through its effects on transcription (26Schroeter E.H.

Vallikad E. Krishna S. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), endogenous Notch nuclear fragments are virtually undetectable in normal cells. A rapid turnover of the nuclear form of Notch (referred to as N-IC) may explain this observation (29Lieber T. Kidd S. Alcamo E. Corbin V. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1949-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor such as lactacystin has been shown to allow its detection (10De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). The C-terminal PEST-like domain of Notch may contribute to instability and degradation of N-IC by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thus preventing potentially deleterious transcription (30Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a tightly regulated process involved in intracellular protein degradation. It appears to play a key regulatory role in basic functions such as cell cycle regulation, cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, and development, and its substrates include transcriptional regulators to cell surface proteins (31Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is a 76-amino acids peptide that is covalently attached to substrate proteins by a complex cascade of enzymes: ubiquitin is first activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1; after activation, one of several E2 enzymes transfers ubiquitin from E1 to a member of the ubiquitin-protein ligase family, E3, to which the substrate is specifically bound. Successive rounds of conjugation end up in the attachment of polyubiquitin chains to the substrate, which is thus targeted for degradation by the proteasome. Only a few E3s have been identified so far, but they seem to belong to a rapidly growing family; and although one E1 and a few E2s seem to be sufficient to ubiquitinate most of the target proteins, each individual E3 seems to bind to a limited number of substrates. At least two large families of E3 enzymes have been identified in mammals: the HECT group (Homologous to E6-AP C Terminus), whose founding member, E6-AP, is required, together with the E6 protein of papillomavirus, to induce degradation of p53, and the SCF family (32Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 33Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). This last group is represented by multiprotein complexes that contain at least four proteins: Skp1, Cul1 in metazoans or Cdc53 in yeast, Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1, and an F-box protein. The F-box proteins can recognize different substrates through specific protein-protein interaction domains. The F-box domain interacts with Skp1, whereas the C terminus mediates substrate binding. A large number of F-box proteins have been identified (more than 100 in theCaenorhabditis elegans genome), suggesting the existence of a large number of substrate proteins. An important observation is that, in the case of the SCF complexes that have been studied in detail, substrate phosphorylation seems to be required for F-box protein binding (32Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 33Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). SEL-10, an F-box protein of the Cdc4 family, was isolated in a genetic screen for Lin12/Notch negative regulators in C. elegans(34Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G.Y. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This protein carries seven WD40 repeats in its C-terminal region; in other complexes these motifs have been shown to interact specifically with the substrate. Coimmunoprecipitation of overexpressed proteins demonstrated that the intracellular domains of Lin12 and murine Notch4 interact with the worm SEL-10 protein (34Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G.Y. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this study we show that mammalian SEL-10 binds to the C-terminal region of Notch1. More interestingly, binding and therefore degradation are restricted to the nuclear compartment and correlate with phosphorylation of the intracellular part of the receptor. A dominant-negative form of SEL-10 stabilizes this nuclear form and increases transcriptional activation of a reporter construct after activation of the receptor. These results strongly suggest that a SEL-10-containing complex is involved in the negative regulation of the Notch cascade by inducing the degradation of the intracellular form of the receptor. 293T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HeLa cells stably transfected with murine Notch1 cDNA, HeLaN1, were maintained as described previously (3Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. Lebail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure and harvested 48 h later. All Notch1 constructs reported here were cloned into the pCS2+ vector. Notch1 constructs, NotchFL, LNG, N-ICΔCT, N-ICΔNLS, and N-ICΔNLS+NLS, have been described previously (7Kopan R. Nye J.S.

The N-IC construct, which encodes the entire intracellular form of Notch1 from the γ-secretase cleavage site to the stop codon was constructed by cloning anEcoRV/SpeI fragment from NotchFL intoEcoRV/XbaI-digested pCS2 N-ICΔCT. hSEL-10 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (primers 5′-CATGTATGTATGTGTGTCCCGAGAAGCGGTTTG and 3′-GTCCACATCAAAGTCCAGCAC) from the EST AI929793 (IMAGE 2519384) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). A polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment from mouse EST AI747954 (IMAGE 2065067) using oligonucleotides GGAATTCCGCTCTAGAGCGACCTGCAGCTCGAGCATA and GGAATTCGATACAAACTGGAGACTAGGAGAA was digested and cloned intoEcoRI/XbaI sites of a pCS2 HA-tagged plasmid. This construct represented the HA-tagged SEL-10ΔF (amino acids 262–627 of hSEL-10). VSV-tagged β-TrCP was a gift from S. Whiteside. Anti-N-IC polyclonal antibody was described by Logeat et al. (3Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. Lebail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and precipitated on protein A-Sepharose beads. Anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-VSV (P5D4) monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1/100 for immunoprecipitations and isolated on protein G-Sepharose. Myc-tagged N-ICΔNLS and N-ICΔNLS+NLS were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody. Subconfluent 293T cells were transiently transfected with 250 ng of Notch1 derivatives and 4 μg of SEL-10ΔF or β-TrCPΔF when indicated. Total transfected DNA amount was equalized to 5 μg with pcDNA3 vector. Transfected cells grown on 60-mm dishes were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 20 mm sodium fluoride, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate as phosphatase inhibitors. After 20 min on ice, cell lysates were cleared at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with the appropriate antibody in a 2-fold diluted lysis buffer. Subsequent steps of immunoprecipitations and immunoblots were done as described earlier (3Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. Lebail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). When mentioned, 50 μm N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) or 50 μm lactacystin was added 90 min before cell lysis. Subconfluent HeLa or HeLaN1 cells were transfected with 500 ng of RBP-luciferase reporter construct (pGa981-6 (36Minoguchi S. Taniguchi Y. Kato H. Okazaki T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), 400 ng of EF1-β-galactosidase (provided by S. Mémet) along with the indicated amounts of SEL-10 or SEL-10ΔF. HeLa cells were transfected with the Notch1 derivatives, and total amounts of transfected DNA were equalized with empty pcDNA3 vector to 2 μg. After 48 h cells were harvested and luciferase activity measured in a luminometer (Berthold) and normalized according to β-galactosidase activity. 48 h after transfection, 293T cells were starved in methionine-free medium for 90 min. Cells were then pulse labeled for 15 min with medium containing 200 μCi of [35S]methionine. Complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.04% methionine was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the times specified (see Fig. 6). 293T cells were transfected with N-IC or pcDNA3 as a control. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in a phosphate-free medium and incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free RPMI supplemented with 10% phosphate-free fetal calf serum. Cells were labeled for 3 h with 500 μCi/ml32Pi. Lysis and anti-Notch immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously. Transfected 293T cell lysates were immunoprecipitated, and the immune complex was incubated in λ protein phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij) supplemented with 2 mm MnCl2at 30 °C for 30 min. Half of the sample was incubated without the enzyme; the other half was treated with 400 units of λ phosphatase (Biolabs). Samples were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Laemmli buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis resolution on a 6.5% gel. cDNA encoding N-IC was translated in vitro in wheat germ extract in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the ubiquitin conjugation assay was performed as described (37Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israël A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a final volume of 12 μl contained the following components: 50 μg of HeLa cell extract to provide the various components of the ubiquitination machinery, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and ∼25,000 cpm of the labeled substrate. To deplete endogenous ATP (−ATP in Fig. 1 B), 20 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 0.2 μg of hexokinase were added. ATP-dependent conjugation was monitored in the presence of 2 mm ATPγS. 0.5 μg of ubiquitinaldehyde, a specific inhibitor of certain isopeptidases (38Hershko A. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1829-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), was added to the reaction mixture to prevent deubiquitination. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, resolved via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). 293T cells transiently transfected with N-IC, a plasmid that encodes the entire intracellular form of Notch1, were treated with one of two proteasome inhibitors: lactacystin (Fig.1 A, lane 2) or ALLN (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Western blot analysis of N-IC revealed a strong stabilization of this protein in the presence of the two proteasome inhibitors. This result suggests that the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway is involved in the stability of the intracellular form of the Notch1 receptor. To confirm this hypothesis, an in vitro ubiquitination experiment was performed. Data in Fig. 1 B show that N-IC is conjugated with ubiquitin (indicated by [Ub]n) and that this conjugation is strictly ATP-dependent. Taken together these observations indicate that the activated form of Notch1 is probably degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This degradation pathway requires a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts directly with the substrate and provides the specificity for the degradation reaction. As SEL-10, an F-box protein, was identified by a genetic screen for Notch negative regulators in C. elegans (34Hubbard E.J.A. Wu G.Y. Kitajewski J. Greenwald I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3182-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the role played by the mammalian counterpart of CeSEL-10 in the Notch signaling pathway. Using a BLAST search for mammalian homologs of CeSEL-10 (39Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar), two ESTs were found. Sequence analysis of mouse EST AI747954 revealed its homology with the C-terminal seven WD40 repeats of C. elegans SEL-10 (Fig.2). The human EST, AI929793, isolated from fetal brain, contained the full-length open reading frame and included both the F-box and the seven WD40 repeats. The predicted protein was 627 amino acids long if the first in-frame methionine was considered (Fig. 2, hSEL-10). In vitrotranslation experiments yielded a protein of around 60 kDa (not shown). Sequence analysis with the whole human genome (htgs, NCBI, NIH) revealed that the human SEL-10 gene localizes to the long arm of chromosome 4. The corresponding UniGene cluster, Hs.31945, contains more than 50 cDNAs expressed ubiquitously as assessed by their origins (16 different tissue sources of ESTs were mentioned in this cluster). This highly conserved protein shared 48% identity with CeSEL-10 and 56% identity when considering the WD40 repeats domain only. The N-terminal Leu-Pro amino acids required for F-box binding to the SCF complex have been conserved (32Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons of human and mouse WD40 repeats revealed only two amino acid substitutions (indicated by asterisks, Fig. 2). A DrosophilaSEL-10, localized at the CG15010 locus, exhibited 78% identity with hSEL-10. SEL-10 belongs to the Fbw family of F-box proteins (40Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and this suggests its implication as part of a ubiquitin ligase of the SCF family. The F-box links the other members of the E3 complex through Skp1, whereas the WD40 repeats constitute the substrate recognition domain. Deleting the F-box domain enables recognition of the substrate without recruiting the rest of the ubiquitination complex, thus competing with the intact protein for substrate binding. A truncated SEL-10 protein was constructed from the mouse EST (SEL-10ΔF) and should represent a dominant-negative form of SEL-10. Different murine Notch constructs were cotransfected with HA-tagged SEL-10ΔF (Fig. 3). The level of N-IC was increased strongly when cotransfected with this molecule (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). This effect was not observed with the inactive membrane-anchored Notch LNG (Fig.3 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Because these two Notch constructs are under the control of the same cytomegalovirus promoter, the increased amount of N-IC could not be attributed to a transcriptional effect of SEL-10ΔF. We then investigated possible interactions between these proteins. Notch and SEL-10ΔF were coexpressed in 293T cells (Fig.3 B). Immunoprecipitation of one protein followed by Western blot analysis of the second revealed a strong interaction between N-IC and SEL-10ΔF (lane 2). However, association between SEL-10ΔF and Notch LNG or N-ICΔCT (an intracellular form of Notch1 deleted of the 349 C-terminal amino acids including the PEST domain (7Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was barely detectable (lanes 6 and 9). These results support the data shown in panel A and suggest that SEL-10ΔF associates with and stabilizes N-IC but that neither the transmembrane inactive Notch, LNG, nor the C-terminally deleted N-ICΔCT significantly interact with SEL-10ΔF. Therefore, SEL-10ΔF acts as a dominant-negative form of SEL-10 inducing N-IC stabilization, whereas full-length SEL-10 does not have this effect (data not shown). To further assess the specificity of SEL-10-Notch interactions, we used another F-box protein, β-TrCP, of the same Fbw family (41Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We cotransfected increasing amounts of β-TrCPΔF, a dominant-negative form of β-TrCP, with a given amount of N-IC. No accumulation of N-IC was observed even at very high concentrations of β-TrCPΔF (Fig.3 C). Immunoprecipitation of β-TrCPΔF did not pull down any Notch (Fig. 3 C), nor did the anti-Notch antibody precipitate any associated β-TrCP (not shown). As the association between SEL-10 and Notch seems to be specific, we determined whether SEL-10 could influence Notch-induced transcriptional activity. Notch transcriptional activity was first monitored by a reporter gene assay in transiently transfected HeLa cells. The reporter construct RBP-luciferase carries the luciferase gene under the control of a synthetic promoter containing 12 RBP-Jκ binding sites (36Minoguchi S. Taniguchi Y. Kato H. Okazaki T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active Notch construct used here (Fig.4 A) is N-IC, which stimulates reporter gene activity 80-fold. No stimulation of the reporter gene was noticed with SEL-10ΔF (Control lanes). But when SEL-10ΔF was cotransfected with N-IC, transcriptional activation of the reporter gene was increased more than 8-fold. When inactive full-length (NotchFL) or LNG Notch constructs were used, no significant stimulation was observed, and addition of SEL-10ΔF had no effect. These experiments reveal that SEL-10ΔF enhanced the transcriptional activity of constitutively active Notch constructs only, but did not, on its own, induce any activation of the RBP promoter. To mimic activation of the entire Notch1 receptor, HeLa cells transiently transfected with NotchFL and RBP-luciferase were treated with EDTA for 15 min; this treatment has been shown recently to induce the dissociation of the heterodimeric Notch1 receptor and to mimic activation (13Rand M.D. Grimm L.M.

https://openalex.org/W1964084914,"Numerous studies have demonstrated the anticancer activity of the tomato carotenoid, lycopene. However, the molecular mechanism of this action remains unknown. Lycopene inhibition of human breast and endometrial cancer cell growth is associated with inhibition of cell cycle progression at the G(1) phase. In this study we determined the lycopene-mediated changes in the cell cycle machinery. Cells synchronized in the G(1) phase by serum deprivation were treated with lycopene or vehicle and restimulated with 5% serum. Lycopene treatment decreased serum-induced phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and related pocket proteins. This effect was associated with reduced cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk4 and cdk2) activities with no alterations in CDK protein levels. Lycopene caused a decrease in cyclin D1 and D3 levels whereas cyclin E levels did not change. The CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) abundance was reduced while p27(Kip1) levels were unaltered in comparison to control cells. Serum stimulation of control cells resulted in reduction in the p27 content in the cyclin E--cdk2 complex and its accumulation in the cyclin D1--cdk4 complex. This change in distribution was largely prevented by lycopene treatment. These results suggest that lycopene inhibits cell cycle progression via reduction of the cyclin D level and retention of p27 in cyclin E--cdk2, thus leading to inhibition of G(1) CDK activities."
https://openalex.org/W1985002187,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exerts its angiogenic effects partly through the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Association with heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and phosphorylation by Akt were recently shown to separately activate eNOS upon VEGF stimulation in endothelial cells. Here, we examined the interplay between these different mechanisms in VEGF-exposed endothelial cells. We documented that hsp90 binding to eNOS is, in fact, the crucial event triggering the transition from the Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS to the phosphorylation-mediated potentiation of its activity by VEGF. Accordingly, we showed that early VEGF stimulation first leads to the Ca2+/calmodulin disruption of the caveolin-eNOS complex and promotes the association between eNOS and hsp90. eNOS-bound hsp90 can then recruit VEGF-activated (phosphorylated) Akt to the complex, which in turn can phosphorylate eNOS. Further experiments in transfected COS cells expressing either wild-type or S1177A mutant eNOS led us to identify the serine 1177 as the critical residue for the hsp90-dependent Akt-mediated activation of eNOS. Finally, we documented that although the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eNOS leads to a sustained production of NO independently of a maintained increase in [Ca2+]i, this late stage of eNOS activation is strictly conditional on the initial VEGF-induced Ca2+-dependent stimulation of the enzyme. These data establish the critical temporal sequence of events leading to the sustained activation of eNOS by VEGF and suggest new ways of regulating the production of NO in response to this cytokine through the ubiquitous chaperone protein, hsp90. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exerts its angiogenic effects partly through the activation of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). Association with heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and phosphorylation by Akt were recently shown to separately activate eNOS upon VEGF stimulation in endothelial cells.

We documented that hsp90 binding to eNOS is, in fact, the crucial event triggering the transition from the Ca2+-dependent activation of eNOS to the phosphorylation-mediated potentiation of its activity by VEGF. Accordingly, we showed that early VEGF stimulation first leads to the Ca2+/calmodulin disruption of the caveolin-eNOS complex and promotes the association between eNOS and hsp90. eNOS-bound hsp90 can then recruit VEGF-activated (phosphorylated) Akt to the complex, which in turn can phosphorylate eNOS. Further experiments in transfected COS cells expressing either wild-type or S1177A mutant eNOS led us to identify the serine 1177 as the critical residue for the hsp90-dependent Akt-mediated activation of eNOS. Finally, we documented that although the VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eNOS leads to a sustained production of NO independently of a maintained increase in [Ca2+]i, this late stage of eNOS activation is strictly conditional on the initial VEGF-induced Ca2+-dependent stimulation of the enzyme. These data establish the critical temporal sequence of events leading to the sustained activation of eNOS by VEGF and suggest new ways of regulating the production of NO in response to this cytokine through the ubiquitous chaperone protein, hsp90. nitric oxide endothelial nitric-oxide synthase calmodulin 90-kDa heat shock protein human umbilical vein endothelial cells endothelial cells intracellular [Ca2+] vascular endothelial growth factor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid Nitric oxide (NO)1contributes to the cardiovascular homeostasis through its profound effects on blood pressure, vascular remodeling, platelet aggregation, and angiogenesis (1Ignarro L.J. Cirino G. Casini A. Napoli C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, the endothelial isoform of NO synthase (eNOS) expressed both in endothelial cells (EC) and cardiac myocytes is the major source of NO in the cardiovascular system (2Balligand J.L. Feron O. Kelly R.A. Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathobiology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2000Google Scholar). eNOS was originally identified as a particulate enzyme, associated primarily with the plasma membrane and with intracellular organelles such as the Golgi complex (3Feron O. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1999; 2: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that trafficking of eNOS from plasmalemmal to intracellular structures is part of a physiological cycle highly sensitive to the state of cell activation (4Feron O. Saldana F.

The dynamic trafficking of eNOS between cell surface and intracellular compartments is supported in part by its close interaction with the scaffold protein caveolin (4Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating eNOS subcellular localization, this stable interaction with caveolin leads to the inhibition of the enzyme activity in basal conditions. Upon increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i), Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) displaces the inhibitory binding of caveolin to eNOS and allows enzyme activation (9Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Similarly, increasing vascular flow and pressure in anin situ artery perfusion model rapidly leads to activation of caveolar eNOS with apparent eNOS dissociation from caveolin and association with calmodulin (10Rizzo V. McIntosh D.P. Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34724-34729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest a bimodal mechanism of regulation of NO production reflecting dynamic changes in the eNOS/caveolin and eNOS/CaM interactions. However, the recent identification of both heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) as a chaperone protein interacting with eNOS (11Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A.

Thus, in the case of VEGF stimulation, both the interaction of eNOS with hsp90 and its phosphorylation by Akt, also referred to as protein kinase B, were recently shown to promote NO production in EC (11Garcia-Cardena G.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Interestingly, each of these regulatory processes,i.e. hsp90 binding or Akt phosphorylation, seems to work by increasing the “apparent” sensitivity of the enzyme to Ca2+/CaM. However, while the former promotes CaM association to eNOS (upon agonist-induced increase in [Ca2+]i) (12Gratton J.P. Fontana J. O'Connor D.S. Garcia-Cardena G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22268-22272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), the latter appears to reduce CaM dissociation from activated eNOS (when [Ca2+]ireturns to basal levels) (13Fulton D.

VEGF has recently received much attention from its key role in vascular permeability and angiogenesis in cardiovascular tissues (23Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar). Since these properties are largely dependent on VEGFs ability to activate eNOS in target tissues, as recently verified in animal models (24Murohara T. Horowitz J.R. Silver M. Tsurumi Y. Chen D. Sullivan A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1998; 97: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 25Murohara T. Asahara T. Silver M. Bauters C. Masuda H. Kalka C. Kearney M. Chen D. Symes J.F. Fishman M.C. Huang P.L. Isner J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar), the recent insights in the post-translational regulation of eNOS posed new fundamental questions that need to be addressed. For instance, is the Ca2+/CaM-mediated caveolin/eNOS dissociation a pre-requisite for eNOS phosphorylation in response to VEGF? Does eNOS/hsp90 association precede eNOS phosphorylation or do these two phenomena occur independently? Is Akt part of the eNOS-hsp90 multicomplex? Is the phosphorylation of eNOS truly a calcium-independent process? To answer these questions, we used a model of human EC in culture as well as the heterologous COS cell expression system to dissect the specific protein-protein interactions, their inter-dependence, and temporal sequence involved in the post-translational regulation of eNOS by VEGF. Freshly isolated human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were cultured to confluence in 100-mm dishes in a 2:1 mixture of M199/endothelial cell basal medium containing 10% serum; control experiments were also performed with myocytes isolated from neonatal mice as previously detailed (26Feron O. Dessy C. Opel D.J. Arstall M.A. Kelly R.A. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30249-30254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and plated at 5 × 105 cells/ml. Serum-starved EC and myocytes were exposed for the indicated periods of time to VEGF (50 ng/ml) and insulin (12.5 milliunits/ml), respectively, in the presence or absence of various pharmacological modulators (30–60 min preincubation with 1 µg/ml geldanamycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies) or 10 µmLY294002 (Sigma)). COS-7 cells were transfected with the different plasmid cDNAs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturers protocol; eNOS and Akt constructs were a gift from Dr. S. Dimmeler and the hsp90 cDNA was provided by Dr. W. C. Sessa. The expression of appropriate proteins was confirmed by Western blotting and an irrelevant plasmid encoding β-galactosidase was used as a control to maintain identical amounts of DNA in each transfection. EC were homogenized in a buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (11Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and processed for immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation in a octyl glucoside-containing buffer as described previously (4Feron O. Saldana F. Michel J.B. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Caveolin, eNOS, and hsp90 antibodies were from BD Transduction Labs, Akt and phospho-Akt antibodies from BD PharMingen, CaM antibody from Santa Cruz, and phospho-eNOS antibody from NEB Cell Signaling Technology. Akt activity was measured using a non-radioactive immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit (NEB Cell Signaling Technology). EC plated on coverslips were incubated with 2 µmFura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min and then extensively washed and placed in a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber for 15 min. Cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope in the epifluorescence mode using a long pass filter cut-off at 510 nm and a dichroic at 405 nm. Alternating wavelength excitation of 340 and 380 nm was provided by a motorized filter wheel. The image pairs monitored by the IonOptix Myocam camera were processed by the IonWizard software (IonOptix, Milton, MA) and are presented as the fluorescence ratio (340/380 nm), a direct index to the [Ca2+]i. In some experiments, Fura-2-loaded cells were preincubated with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (20 µm). After rinsing coverslips, EC were left to recover for 5 min before VEGF stimulation. Quantitative analysis of nitrite (NO 2−) was used as an index of NO production. Briefly, aliquots of the medium bathing intact EC were collected at the time intervals corresponding to either 0–2 or 5–30 min of VEGF exposure. For the latter period, the medium bathing the VEGF-stimulated cells for the first 5 min was discarded and replaced by fresh VEGF-containing medium for the next 25 min. In COS cells experiments, NO 2− accumulation in the interval time of 44 to 48 h after transfection was measured. Acidic iodide was used to convert NO 2−to NO that was electrochemically measured with an NO-selective microsensor (WPI), as recommended by the manufacturer; adequate controls using either vehicle or NOS inhibitors were routinely performed in parallel. Data are normalized for the amount of protein in the dish, and are presented for convenience as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were made using Student's t test or one-way ANOVA where appropriate. Following exposure to VEGF (50 ng/ml) for increasing periods of time (0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 30 min), EC were collected, lysed, and cell extracts used for immunoprecipitation as follows. First, extracts were immunoprecipitated with caveolin antibodies and the immunoprecipitation immunoblotted with eNOS antibodies (Fig. 1A, top). We observed that the fraction of eNOS associated to caveolin in basal conditions rapidly dissociated from caveolin when EC were exposed to VEGF. In fact, the dissociation was complete in the first 2 min of VEGF exposure and was maintained for at least 30 min in the presence of VEGF. We then performed experiments to determine the time course of hsp90 interaction with eNOS. Fig. 1 A(bottom) shows that, in these experimental conditions, by using eNOS antibodies, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate hsp90 after a minimum of 2 min of cell exposure to VEGF, e.g. after the dissociation of the caveolin-eNOS complex. In a parallel series of experiments, we examined the time course of both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation in VEGF-stimulated EC using antibodies directed against phosphorylated Ser473 and Ser1177 in Akt and eNOS, respectively. We observed thatmaximal eNOS phosphorylation occurred after at least 5 min of VEGF exposure (Fig. 1 B, top) whereas the stimulatory effect of VEGF on Akt phosphorylation was already observed at 30 s in our experimental conditions (Fig. 1 B, bottom); densitometric analysis of these observations is presented in Fig. 1 C. To further assess if the VEGF/Akt signaling cascade accounted for the observed eNOS phosphorylation in our experimental conditions, we used the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 known to prevent phosphorylation and activation of the downstream effector Akt (16Gallis B. Corthals G.L. Goodlett D.R. Ueba H. Kim F. Presnell S.R. Figeys D. Harrison D.G. Berk B.C. Aebersold R. Corson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30101-30108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 21Dimmeler S. Dernbach E. Zeiher A.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 B (right), we show that a 1-h preincubation with LY294002 (10 µm) completely prevented both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation upon 30 min VEGF stimulation. We next sought to determine whether eNOS and Akt interact together in eNOS/Akt co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Interestingly, as illustrated in Fig. 2A(top), we consistently observed the co-immunoprecipitation of Akt with eNOS with a time course in agreement with the observed pattern of eNOS phosphorylation (see Fig. 1 B) and hsp90/eNOS interaction (see Fig. 1 A); using anti-phospho-Akt antibodies, we verified that the eNOS-bound Akt was the activated (phosphorylated) form of the kinase (not shown). Based on this correlation in the kinetics, we then examined whether these different events were directly related. EC were pre-exposed for 30 min, before VEGF stimulation, to geldanamycin (1 µg/ml), an agent known to inhibit hsp90 function (11Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar), and corresponding lysates were submitted to immunoprecipitation with eNOS antibodies. In these conditions, hsp90 was no longer detectable in eNOS immunoprecipitation (not shown) and neither was Akt (Fig. 2 A, bottom). In an attempt to appreciate the proportion of eNOS involved in the geldanamycin-sensitive recruitment of Akt, we further developed the reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay: hsp90 and Akt antibodies were used to imunoprecipitate eNOS (which was detected by immunoblotting) and the supernatants of these immunoprecipitations were checked for residual eNOS presence; for this purpose, the immunoprecipitated supernatants were submitted to a second immunoprecipitation with eNOS antibodies. Since both hsp90/eNOS (Fig. 1 A) and Akt/eNOS co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A) appeared maximal after 5 min VEGF exposure, we chose to perform the immunoprecipitation from extracts of EC pre-exposed for 5 min to VEGF in the presence or absence of geldanamycin. Fig. 2 B (first and second lanes) shows that approximately the same amount of eNOS that was immunoprecipitated by hsp90 antibodies was found in the supernatant of this immunoprecipitation. A similar pattern was found for the Akt/eNOS immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 B,fifth and sixth lanes), indicating that around half of the total eNOS pool was engaged in hsp90 and Akt interaction in the conditions of our assay. The geldanamycin pretreatment did not lead to any detectable amount of eNOS immunoprecipitated either by hsp90 or Akt antibodies (Fig. 2 B, third and seventh lanes); all the pool of eNOS was found in the supernatants of these immunoprecipitations, as detected by immunoblotting after a second immunoprecipitation with eNOS antibodies (Fig. 2 B, fourth and eighth lanes). To further test our hypothesis that hsp90/eNOS interaction is necessary for Akt phosphorylation of eNOS, we also examined Akt and eNOS phosphorylation patterns in the presence of geldanamycin. We observed that although Akt phosphorylation was detectable as soon as 30 s after VEGF addition despite the presence of geldanamycin (Fig. 2 C, bottom), no phospho-eNOS signal was detectable even upon prolonged VEGF exposures (Fig.2 C, top) in striking contrast with the control condition (Fig. 2 C, right). We also verified that geldanamycin treatment had no significant effect on the time course of caveolin/eNOS dissociation (not shown). To exclude a direct effect of geldanamycin on Akt, we measured Akt activity in EC exposed for 30 min to VEGF in the presence or absence of geldanamycin. After selective immunoprecipitation of Akt from the corresponding lysates, immunoprecipitates were incubated with purified GSK-3 and Akt-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 was evaluated by immunoblotting using specific anti-phospho-GSK-3 antibody. Fig.2 D shows that the 30-min VEGF-stimulated Akt activity was not altered by the pretreatment of cells with geldanamycin, whereas not surprisingly, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abrogated the Akt activation in VEGF-exposed EC. We then sought to determine whether the inhibitory effect of geldanamycin on eNOS phosphorylation could be reproduced in another cell type and upon another agonist stimulation. Accordingly, we exposed neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes to insulin (a known activator of Akt in myocytes (27Pham F.H. Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1252-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)) for 5 min with or without geldanamycin and examined the phosphorylation status of Akt and eNOS. Fig. 2 Eshows that while the pretreatment with geldanamycin (1 µg/ml) did not alter the insulin-induced Akt activation, it completely abolished eNOS phosphorylation. We also took advantage of the native expression of GSK-3 in myocytes to determine whether geldanamycin could influence the phosphorylation of this other Akt substrate. Fig. 2 E(lower panel) shows that the insulin-induced increase in GSK-3 phosphorylation was not altered by geldanamycin. Of note, the stimulatory effect of insulin on Akt, eNOS, and GSK-3 phosphorylation was blocked by preincubation of myocytes with 50 µmLY294002 (not shown). Since our finding of hsp90-dependent phosphorylation of Ser1177 eNOS could be confounded by the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of eNOS on other sites as recently reported by others (18Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Kemp B.E.

Res. 2001; 88: E68-E75Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), we carried out transfection experiments to evaluate the effect of geldanamycin treatment and hsp90 overexpression in COS cells expressing either wild-type eNOS or S1177A eNOS (construct in which the serine 1177 is mutated in alanine). We first validated that when COS cells were co-transfected with active Akt (T308D/S473D), a significant increase in nitrite production was observed in WT-eNOS-expressing cells (+64 ± 4%) whereas no change in eNOS activity was detected with the non-phosphorylable S1177A eNOS cells (Fig.3, see bars 3 and4). Interestingly, when COS cells were pretreated for 30 min with geldanamycin, around 70% of the Akt-dependent increase in nitrite production in WT-eNOS cells was blocked (Fig. 3,bar 5). In another series of experiments, the cellular pool of hsp90 was increased by 2-fold (see Fig. 3, lower panel) by co-transfecting hsp90 cDNA either with WT- or S1177A-eNOS constructs. As shown in Fig. 3 (bars 7 and 8), the consecutive increase in nitrite production (+49 ± 4 and +40 ± 3%, respectively) was similar in both conditions. By contrast, when active Akt (T308D/S473D) was also present in the system, a synergistic increase of 152 ± 8% over basal level of nitrite production was observed in cells expressing WT-eNOS (Fig. 3,bar 9), whereas no further change (over the hsp90-alone condition) was observed in S1177A eNOS cells (Fig. 3, comparebars 8 and 10); preincubation with geldanamycin blocked 70–95% of the recombinant hsp90- and hsp90/Akt-mediated increase in NO production (not shown). The lower panel of Fig. 3 shows the immunoblots for eNOS (WT and S1177A), Myc-tagged Akt and hsp90 (recombinant + endogenous). We next studied the calcium dependence of the Akt/hsp90 recruitment and eNOS phosphorylation process by preincubating EC with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA before exposure to VEGF. Fig.4A shows the pattern of changes in [Ca2+]i in EC exposed to VEGF in the absence and presence of 20 µm BAPTA-AM. VEGF exposure led to a slightly delayed calcium transient peaking after 1 min and slowly returning to basal levels in agreement with the reported phospholipase C-γ-dependent calcium release from internal stores (29He H. Venema V.J. Gu X. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. Caldwell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In the presence of BAPTA, the VEGF-evoked calcium transient was completely abrogated, indicating that under these experimental conditions, any further change in eNOS activity may be considered as independent of changes in measurable [Ca2+]i. In conditions where BAPTA blocked the VEGF-induced increase in [Ca2+]i we observed a complete inhibition of caveolin/eNOS dissociation as reflected by the consistent amount of eNOS co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin over time in response to VEGF exposure (Fig. 4 B, top). Calcium clamping by BAPTA also prevented the VEGF-induced Akt/eNOS co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 B, middle) and eNOS phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, bottom). Of note, the hsp90/eNOS co-immunoprecipitation was also completely prevented by the use of BAPTA (not shown). Importantly, when using the 30-min VEGF exposure in the absence of BAPTA as a control condition, we consistently observed the dissociation of eNOS from caveolin, the eNOS/Akt interaction as well as eNOS phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, right). We next measured the activity of eNOS following VEGF stimulation in the presence and absence of geldanamycin. Preliminary experiments revealed that the rate of NO 2− produced in the first 5-min interval (0–5 min) after VEGF stimulation was ∼2–3-fold higher than in the following 30 min (Fig.5A), in agreement with the 5-min duration of the VEGF-induced calcium transient (Fig.4 A). However, considering that the phosphorylation of eNOS was already maximal after 5 min (see Fig. 1 C), we chose to compare the levels of NO 2− produced in the 0–2- and 5–30-min intervals following VEGF addition in order to better distinguish between direct Ca2+/CaM-dependent and phosphorylation-mediated activation of eNOS. As shown in Fig. 5 B (where the nitrite production is normalized per min), geldanamycin pretreatment significantly inhibited the late VEGF-induced eNOS activation in agreement with the observed inhibition of interaction with hsp90 and Akt, whereas no significant effect on the early VEGF-induced eNOS activation was observed. Importantly, similar results were obtained using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 confirming that the effect of Akt phosphorylation on eNOS activation was limited to the late activation of the enzyme. Of note, the basal level of [Ca2+]i and the profile of the VEGF-induced calcium transient were not altered by pretreatments with geldanamycin or LY294002 (not shown). We next determined the calcium dependence of the early and late activation of eNOS by measuring the VEGF-induced NO 2− production in the presence of the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA. As shown in Fig. 5 B, preincubation with 20 µm BAPTA-AM, in conditions similar to those used in Fig. 4 A, was sufficient to block not only the early (0–2 min) but also the late eNOS activation (5–30 min). Importantly, when BAPTA was added after the early phase of enzyme activation (at t = 5 min), we did not observe any significant reduction in the level of eNOS activation for the 5–30-min period (versus vehicle condition; not shown). Finally, we also used the calcium ionophore A23187 to examine whether a temporary increase in [Ca2+]i similar to the initial Ca2+ ri"

With the mitochondrial photosensitizer Pc 4, PDT induces apoptosis, yet its molecular targets are not known. Here, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is shown to be highly sensitive to PDT, as judged on Western blots by the disappearance of anti-Bcl-2-reactive material from the position of the native 26 kDa protein. The loss of Bcl-2 was PDT dose dependent and was observed for both endogenous and overexpressed Bcl-2 in several cell lines, immediately after PDT, and with chilled cells. It was accompanied by a trace of a 23-kDa cleavage product as well as high-molecular weight products that may result from photochemical crosslinking. PDT-induced Bcl-2 loss occurred in MCF-7 cells that do not express caspase-3 or in the presence of protease inhibitors, but was prevented, along with the induction of apoptosis, by the singlet oxygen scavenger L-histidine. Loss of FLAG-Bcl-2 was observed with both anti-FLAG and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies, indicating loss of native protein rather than simple BCL-2-epitope destruction. Photochemical damage was not observed in Bcl-x(L), Bax, Bad, the voltage-dependent anion channel, or the adenine nucleotide translocator. Therefore, Bcl-2 is one target of PDT with Pc 4, and PDT damage to Bcl-2 contributes to its efficient induction of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2046288058,"The transcription regulation activity of p53 controls cellular response to a variety of stress conditions, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. Despite major progress in the understanding of the global effects of p53 on cellular function the pathways by which p53 activates apoptosis are not well defined. To study genes activated in the p53 induced apoptotic process, we used a mouse myeloid leukemic cell line (LTR6) expressing the temperature-sensitive p53 (val135) that undergoes apoptosis upon shifting the temperature to 32 degrees C. We analysed the gene expression profile at different time points after p53 activation using oligonucleotide microarray capable of detecting approximately 11,000 mRNA species. Cluster analysis of the p53-regulated genes indicate a pattern of early and late induced sets of genes. We show that 91 and 44 genes were substantially up and down regulated, respectively, by p53. Functional classification of these genes reveals that they are involved in many aspects of cell function, in addition to growth arrest and apoptosis. Comparison of p53 regulated gene expression profile in LTR6 cells to that of a human lung cancer cell line (H1299) that undergoes growth arrest but not apoptosis demonstrates that only 15% of the genes are common to both systems. This observation supports the presence of two distinct transcriptional programs in response to p53 signaling, one leading to growth arrest and the other to apoptosis. The proapoptotic genes induced only in LTR6 cells like Apaf-1, Sumo-1 and gelsolin among others may suggest a possible explanation for apoptosis in LTR6 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2047927022,"The polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) evolved in vertebrates to carry out biological functions related to changes in cell position and morphology. Many of these effects involve the attenuation of cell interactions that are not mediated through NCAM's own adhesion properties. A proposed mechanism for this global effect on cell interaction is the steric inhibition of membrane-membrane apposition based solely on polysialic acid (PSA) biophysical properties. However, it remains possible that the intrinsic binding or signaling properties of the NCAM polypeptide are also involved. To help resolve this issue, this study uses a quantitative cell detachment assay together with cells engineered to display different adhesion receptors together with a variety of polysialylated NCAM polypeptide isoforms and functional domain deletion mutations. The results obtained indicate that regulation by PSA occurs with adhesion receptors as diverse as an IgCAM, a cadherin and an integrin, and does not require NCAM functional domains other than those minimally required for polysialylation. These findings are most consistent with the cell apposition mechanism for PSA action, as this model predicts that the inhibitory effects of PSA-NCAM on cell adhesion should be independent of the nature of the adhesion system and of any intrinsic binding or signaling properties of the NCAM polypeptide itself.

Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These functions, which include the facilitation of cell migration, axon pathfinding and synaptogenesis, appear to stem from the ability of PSA-NCAM to reduce cell interactions. Although most abundant during development of both neural and non-neural tissues, PSA-NCAM is also associated with restricted parts of the adult brain that exhibit functional plasticity that may require the rearrangement of neural cells or their interconnections. Remarkably, many of the biological effects of NCAM polysialylation appear to involve cell interactions thought to be mediated by adhesion receptors other than NCAM itself. For example, the regulation of axon fasciculation by PSA expression in the motorneuron plexus of the chick hindlimb can be mimicked by antibodies against the L1 adhesion molecule (2Tang J. Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and the inhibition of mossy fiber synaptogenesis by PSA expression in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus (3Seki T. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is likely to involve cadherin-like receptors. These observations are also consistent with a variety of in vitro studies in which PSA removal by a specific endoneuraminidase appears to enhance adhesion involving other CAMs, and can even affect artificially induced cell adherence or agglutination produced by non-physiological ligands such as poly-l-lysine (4Acheson A.

In view of PSA's biophysical properties and its ability to affect multiple types of cell interactions, a reasonable case has been made for a simple steric mechanism by which expression of PSA at the cell surface can hinder membrane-membrane and receptor-receptor apposition (10Yang P.

Nevertheless, a variety of NCAM-associated activities have been described that could in principle be affected by this post-translational modification.

In this respect, the steric mechanism makes the bold prediction that the effects of PSA on a variety of adhesion receptors should not be affected by deletion of these regions, provided that those deletions do not prevent NCAM polysialylation itself. The goal of this study is to test this prediction in detail. Before addressing the domain deletions within NCAM, it was necessary to establish a rigorous and quantitative assay for PSA function with multiple, defined adhesion systems. Although other adhesion molecules have been implicated in PSA-mediated effects on cells and in tissues, these demonstrations have involved indirect interpretations of results obtained with perturbations by anti-CAM antibodies or by removal of calcium. In the present approach, adhesion is measured between known cell surface receptors and a glass surface coated with the appropriate purified protein binding partner (24Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In addition, cell detachment as opposed to attachment is used as a measure of adhesive strength, both to obtain better quantitation and because the biological roles of PSA in tissue are more related to the breaking of cell-cell contacts, as in axon defasciculation, cell translocation, and the transient formation of junctions. A second requirement for the study is to obtain polysialylation at the cell surface in the absence of NCAM domains associated with NCAM polypeptide functions. This has been accomplished by transfecting NCAM-negative CHO cells with NCAM or mutated NCAM cDNAs plus a polysialyltransferase (PST) known to be sufficient for the synthesis of PSA-NCAM (26Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1188-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Through the combination of these methods, we are able to provide strong evidence that PSA-NCAM can modulate L1-, cadherin-, and integrin-mediated adhesion, and that this effect is independent of either the cytoplasmic domains or the Ig domains that are the site of NCAM's binding and/or signaling properties. The full-length NCAM 180 and NCAM 140 cDNAs were isolated from an oligo(dT)-primed Zap Express cDNA library (Stratagene) which was generated from St 33 embryonic chick brain poly(A) RNA. A [32P]cDNA probe (508 base pairs) was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction corresponding to nucleotide positions 2004–2511 of the chick NCAM using the Rediprime random primer method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed as suggested by the manufacturer. Positive clones were plaque-purified and then in vivo excised into pBK-CMV-based phagemids by infection with ExAssist helper phage followed by transduction of filamentous phage particles into Escherichia coli XLOLR. The LacZ fragments were removed from these expression vectors. NCAM 120 was isolated from an adult chick brain λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) using a 314-base pair NCAM 120-specific cDNA probe, positions 2104–2417. The longest cDNA inserts were subcloned into pGEM-7zf plasmids and sequenced. The partial NCAM 120 cDNA missing immunoglobulin domains 1–3 was swapped into the NCAM 180 pBK-CMV vector using a PmlI site to make full-length NCAM 120 cDNA. Deletion mutants, D1–3 and D1–4, were generated by removal of nucleotides 66–659 or 66–1219 using ATG sites in the full-length NCAM 140 cDNA. Human ST8SiaIV PST was the kind gift of Dr. Minoru Fukuda (The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) and was subcloned into pcDNA3.1zeo. The cDNA fragments digested out from 5 different NCAMs with a CMV promoter and SV40 poly(A) were subcloned into the PSTpcDNA3.1zeo vector using a BglII site to make a dual CMV promoter vector that can induce expression of both NCAM and the transferase. Human neuroblastoma cell lines, IMR-32 and SK-N-SH, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The human N-cadherin stably transfected neomycin-resistant CHO cell clone number 35.4 was the kind gift of Dr. Carien Niessen (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Human L1-IgCAM stably transfected neomycin-resistant CHO cells were generated by transfection of phL1ApcDNA3, which was the kind gift of Dr. Vance Lemmon (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). Stable transfections were carried out using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. In brief, CHO cells were plated in a 24-well culture plate (Falcon), grown to 90% confluency in 0.5 ml of culture medium containing 10% serum. Transfections were carried out at 37 °C by directly adding 0.1 ml of OPTI-MEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 2.5 µg of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 8 µg of DNA to each 24-well plate. After 24 h, cells were detached using trypsin, resuspended in serum containing medium, and replated in 100-mm dishes in the presence of 400 µg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks to select for stable transfectants. The expression vectors for pcDNA3.1zeo of chick NCAM 180, 140, 120, D1–3, and D1–4 with human PST were transfected into N-cadherin or L1 stably transfected CHO cells and selected using 200 µg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Independent stable clones were isolated and their expression levels analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cells and embryonic chick brain tissue (day 9, stage 35) were extracted in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PSA on NCAM was specifically removed (either on intact cells or in extracts) using purified endoneuraminidase N (endo N, 20 units/ml, 30 min, 25 °C), isolated as described (28Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R., Yu, F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing equal quantities of total protein were separated on 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred by electrophoresis onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The blots were incubated with monoclonal human N-cadherin antibody (C70320, Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal human L1 antibody (kind gift of Dr. Vance Lemmon, Case Western Reserve University), or monoclonal antibodies against human NCAM (123C3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or chick NCAM (mAbs 5e and 105, which recognize NCAM domains Ig3 and FN2, respectively (16Frelinger 3rd, A.L. Rutishauser U. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). The membranes were first blocked for 1 h in TBS-T (0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk (Bio-Rad), then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the anti-CAM antibodies diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer, and finally washed 3 times for 5 min in large volumes of TBS-T. The peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or anti-mouse (Promega), diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T. After incubation with the second antibody for 60 min at room temperature, membranes were washed 4 times for 5 min with TBS-T. Detection was performed using the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The soluble extracellular segment of Xenopus C-cadherin attached to the Fc region of human IgG was the kind gift of Dr. Carien Niessen (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Fibronectin and laminin were purchased from Becton Dickinson and Sigma, respectively. The complete extracellular domain of human L1 with a human IgG Fc tail (L1-Fc) was generated in CHO cells (29Fransen E. D'Hooge R. Van Camp G. Verhoye M. Sijbers J. Reyniers E. Soriano P. Kamiguchi H. Willemsen R. Koekkoek S.K. De Zeeuw C.I. De Deyn P.P. Van der Linden A. Lemmon V. Kooy R.F. Willems P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) from an expression vector kindly provided by Dr. Vance Lemmon (Case Western Reserve University). Conditioned media from the L1-expressing CHO cell cultures was filtered through a 0.22-µm filter and applied to a HiTrap protein A HP column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of ImmunoPure IgG binding buffer (Pierce) and the protein eluted by ImmunoPure IgG elution buffer (Pierce). The eluate was immediately adjusted to neutral pH by 1 m Tris buffer (pH 8). Desalting and buffer exchange was performed using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. Laminar flow adhesion assays in glass capillaries were performed as previously described (24Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Glass capillary tubes (1.1 mm internal diameter; Sutter Instruments) were coated with C-cadherin-Fc (0.1 mg/ml), fibronectin (15 µg/ml), laminin (15 µg/ml), or L1-Fc (0.1 mg/ml) in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, and 1 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber and then blocked with 5% milk (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at room temperature. The coated capillary was connected to a 60-ml syringe attached to a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments) and mounted on an inverted microscope (Zeiss Inc). For pretreatment with endo N, cells were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C at a final concentration of 20 units/ml. Cells were isolated by incubation with 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 10 min, then pipetted and collected by centrifugation and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red (Life Technologies, Inc.). The adhesion assay was performed at room temperature as follows: cells were drawn into the coated capillary from a reservoir using the pump. After 1 min, the flow was stopped and the cells were allowed to bind to the surface for 10 min. The number of cells in a selected microscope field was then recorded in a digital photograph. Flow was initiated and the number of cells remaining in the same field was recorded after 30 s. Subsequently, the flow rate was doubled every 30 s, and the number of the cells remaining in the field was recorded at the end of each time period. IMR-32 and SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells express similar levels of N-cadherin and NCAM, but the NCAM of IMR-32 cells is much more heavily polysialylated than that of the SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 2,A and B). The level of PSA on the IMR-32 cells, as judged by electrophoretic properties, is similar to that observed for embryonic brain tissue (Fig. 2 A). Therefore a comparison of the adhesion properties of these cells to a cadherin substrate provides an opportunity to assess the effect of endogenous PSA on cadherin homophilic function. These studies were able to use purified C-cadherin as the homophilic partner for N-cadherin, as the adhesion properties of C-cadherin are equivalent to those of N-cadherin. 2C. Niessen and B. Gumbiner, personal communication. As shown in Fig.2, C and D, the strength of the calcium-dependent adhesion of the SK-N-SH cells to C-cadherin is greater than that of the IMR-32 cells. Furthermore, while removal of PSA results in an increase in adhesion for both cell types, the increase is larger for the IMR-32 cells. In fact, after endo N treatment, the adhesion properties of the two cell types are indistinguishable. Together, these findings indicate that the IMR-32 and SK-N-SH cells have similar levels of potential cadherin activity, and that this activity is regulated according to the amount of PSA co-expressed at the cell surface. In addition to N-cadherin, these neuroblastoma cells express αvβ1 integrin and thus exhibit adhesivity for a fibronectin substrate (30Dedhar S. Haqq C. Gray V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4832-4836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As noted in a previous report (31Dedhar S. Gray V. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), this binding is relatively weak for IMR-32 cells as compared with SK-N-SH cells. As shown in Fig. 2 E, the removal of PSA from the IMR-32 cells increases their adhesion to fibronectin, suggesting that the weakness of integrin-mediated binding by these cells is at least in part due to the co-expression of PSA-NCAM. This finding extends the range of endogenous PSA effects to receptors involved in cell-matrix interactions as well as those involving cell-cell adhesion receptors. The above studies indicate that PSA expression is required for the different cadherin adhesive activity of two neuroblastoma cell lines. To establish that PSA is sufficient for regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion, we exploited the fact that PSA synthesis on NCAM can be conferred by the addition of a single glycosyltransferase (26Muhlenhoff M. Eckhardt M. Bethe A. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1188-1191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Nakayama J. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1829-1832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For this purpose, as well as subsequent studies of NCAM structural mutations, a CHO cell line that has no detectable adhesion systems was used to make transfectants with and without NCAM (180 isoform), polysialyltransferase, and N-cadherin. As shown in Fig. 3A, stably transfected CHO cells expressing NCAM and N-cadherin exhibited significantly less cadherin-mediated adhesion when subsequently transfected with polysialyltransferase cDNA. That the transferase produced PSA expression was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, which revealed a level of polysialylation similar to that found in embryonic brain tissue (Fig. 4A,NCAM 180). That this expression resulted in the decreased adhesion was established by reversing the effect by treatment with endo N (Fig. 3 A).Figure 4The effect of PSA on cadherin-mediated adhesion is independent of NCAMs major alternative splicing variations. A and B, expression of polysialylated NCAM isoforms 180, 140, or 120 and N-cadherin by the appropriately transfected CHO cells was assessed by SDS-PAGE immunoblots using 40 µg of total extracted protein and antibodies against chick NCAM (mAb 5e) or human N-cadherin. Embryonic chick brain tissue is shown as a reference. Endo N was used to remove the PSA from the cells or tissue prior to protein extraction. Note that all three NCAM isoforms are heavily polysialylated (as reflected in the slower and disperse electrophoretic mobility of the NCAM before endo N treatment), and are expressed at similar levels (as judged after treatment with endo N). Cadherin expression levels are also equivalent in each cell line. C-E, adhesion to the cadherin substrate by the above cell lines. For all three polysialylated NCAM isoforms the level of cadherin-mediated adhesion is very similar. After removal of the PSA by endo N, this adhesivity increases by the same amount, regardless of the NCAM isoform being expressed. Data are mean ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As indicated in the Introduction, many of the in vivostudies of PSA pertain to the L1 IgCAM. Although neuroblastoma cells express L1, it is as a splice variant that lacks adhesive activity (32Felding-Habermann B. Silletti S. Mei F. Siu C.H. Yip P.M. Brooks P.C. Cheresh D.A. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Montgomery A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1567-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to establish the role of PSA in L1-mediated adhesionin vitro, the CHO cell transfectants described above were also prepared with the adhesive form of L1 rather than N-cadherin. The flow adhesion assay was then performed with an L1-coated substrate. Despite the quantitative and qualitative changes in adhesive properties that accompany a switch from a calcium-dependent cadherin to a calcium-independent IgCAM, the negative regulation of this adhesion as a result of PSA expression (Fig. 3 B) was similar to that obtained for N-cadherin (Fig. 3 A). Again the effectiveness of the transferase was confirmed by electrophoresis (Fig.4 A, NCAM 180), and the role of PSA was established by endo N treatment (Fig. 3 B). These studies were designed to determine if the major NCAM cytoplasmic splicing variants (NCAM 180, 140, and 120, see Fig. 1) affect the ability of PSA to regulate cadherin-mediated adhesion. CHO cells were stably transfected with NCAM 180, 140, or 120 as well as N-cadherin and the polysialyltransferase. Clones of each NCAM isoform having a similar level of NCAM expression, N-cadherin expression, and polysialylation were then selected (Fig. 4 A). Remarkably, the flow detachment profiles for these three cell lines revealed an identical level of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the presence of PSA, and the same increase in this adhesion after the removal of PSA by endo N treatment (Fig. 4, C-E). The level of adhesion obtained after removal of PSA was the same as obtained for cells transfected with N-cadherin alone (compare controls in Fig. 3 A with Fig.4, C-E), suggesting that NCAM itself does not contribute significantly to the adhesiveness of the cells under the conditions of this assay. In order to examine a possible role of NCAM Ig domains (other than those required for polysialylation itself) in PSA regulation of N-cadherin-mediated binding, NCAM deletion mutants lacking Ig domains 1 to 3 (D1–3) or 1 to 4 (D1–4) were generated from NCAM 140. These constructs were then used to stably transfect CHO cells along with N-cadherin and polysialyltransferase. Appropriate levels of NCAM, N-cadherin, and PSA were selected as above (Fig.5A). Although earlier studies suggested that NCAM polysialylation of Ig domain 5 requires the presence of Ig domain 4 (9Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we found that the D1–4 mutation had a similar level of PSA on CHO cells to that of the D1–3 mutation or the intact NCAM 140. It should be noted that the NCAM immunoblots in this characterization was carried out with a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope in a FNIII domain. This epitope is partially masked by PSA (11Yang P. Major D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore stains PSA-NCAM less intensely and with greater variability. Nevertheless, the electrophoretic patterns obtained for each NCAM form were indicative of heavily polysialylated NCAM. Despite the concentration of NCAM activities in the first four NCAM Ig domains (Fig. 1), their deletion had no detectable effect on the ability of PSA to regulate N-cadherin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 5,B and C). In fact, comparison of all of the NCAM mutations generated for this study (both cytoplasmic, Fig. 4, and extracellular, Fig. 5) reveals that the flow detachment curves are essentially identical for the five types of PSA-positive cells, as well as for the more adhesive PSA-negative (endo N-treated) cells. The NCAM Ig domain deletion study was extended to L1 IgCAM-mediated homophilic adhesion because interactions have been reported among Ig domains in general and between NCAM and L1 in particular (13Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Kadmon G. Kowitz A. Altevogt P. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this situation, our ability to get effective polysialylation of the Ig1–4 as well as the Ig1–3 deletion was critical, in that Ig4 contains the proposed interaction site (12Horstkorte R. Schachner M. Magyar J.P. Vorherr T. Schmitz B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As above, the levels of NCAM and PSA expression were monitored by electrophoresis, as well as that of L1 (Fig.6, A and B). The results were equivalent to those obtained for N-cadherin: the flow assay curves for L1-mediated homophilic adhesion in the presence of PSA-NCAM 140 and its polysialylated D1–3 and D1–4 mutations were identical, and removal of PSA from each NCAM variant produced similar increases in adhesion. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of PSA-NCAM on cell adhesion are independent of the nature of the adhesion system and of all known structural or functional properties of NCAM except those required for PSA expression. That is, the negative regulation occurs equally well with receptor systems as diverse as those mediated by an IgCAM (other than NCAM itself), a cadherin, or an integrin, and does not require NCAM functional domains other than those minimally required for NCAM polysialylation and transport to the cell surface. To obtain definitive evidence, several parameters had to be considered in the choice of an adhesion assay and in the introduction of NCAM molecular variants into cells. The flow shear assay originally devised for cadherins by the Gumbiner laboratory was chosen because of two key features. First, the adhesion occurs between a cell and a surface coated with a specific, purified adhesion ligand, thus allowing for specificity in the mechanism of attachment. Second, this assay quantitates the detachment rather than attachment of cells, which provides a better measure of the strength and stability of the binding and thus is more similar to the effects of PSA on membrane-membrane separation observed in vivo. It should also be noted that the detachment is carried out over a range of shear forces, and thereby yields multiple measurements that together give a superior assessment of effects that alter adhesive strengths. One potential drawback of the substrate detachment assay is that PSA is present on only one of the two interacting surfaces, namely the cell. The effects of PSA on cell adhesion are known to be greater if the carbohydrate is expressed on both membranes during cell-cell contact (33Hoffman S. Edelman G.M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1984; 181: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the possibility exists that we are underestimating its activity in the substrate-cell assay. Another important advance has been the ability to engineer cells simultaneously with respect to adhesion systems, NCAM domain structure, and NCAM polysialylation. These molecular tools would not have been valid unless physiologically relevant levels of NCAM polysialylation could be obtained. Fortunately, the PSA-NCAM produced by transfection of cells with the PST transferase is similar in amount and quality, as judged by its appearance and electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE immunoblots, to that obtained from embryonic brain tissue and PSA-positive neural cell lines. The degree and uniformity of the glycosylation levels obtained suggest that it is relatively easy to get adequate levels of the transferase expressed in these cells, and that other factors, such as decreasing enzyme affinity with polymer length (34Oka S. Bruses J.L. Nelson R.W. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19357-19463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), serve to regulate the extent of the polymerization. In the present study, the minimal NCAM structural requirements for polysialylation has been found to be less than that reported previously (9Nelson R.W. Bates P.A. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17171-17179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). That is, high levels of glycosylation could be obtained in the absence of Ig domains 1–4 rather than 1–3. The ability to delete Ig domain 4 was useful in that several activities and natural structural variants for NCAM are found in this region of the protein. The difference in the minimal constructs in the two studies has not been determined, but could reflect the cell lines used. In particular, the cell line used previously (F11) has endogenous PSA-NCAM with relatively modest polymer lengths. Moreover, the mutated NCAM in the F11 cells has to compete with endogenous native NCAM as a substrate for the transferase. With establishment of these technical requirements, the interpretation of the results obtained becomes relatively straightforward. It is striking not only that PSA can affect specific adhesion mediated by L1, N-cadherin, and αvβ1 integrin, but that the magnitude of the negative inhibition is very similar in each case (a 40–60% decrease at a shear of 8 ml/min). Because these different adhesion mechanisms occur by completely different molecular interactions, it is unlikely that PSA produces this effect through a specific and direct inactivation of the receptors themselves. On the other hand, a global effect on membrane-membrane apposition would predict exactly this phenomenon, and is consistent with a relatively uniform effect on the different adhesion mechanisms. The first studies of PSA focussed on NCAM itself, and demonstrated a similar inhibition of NCAM homophilic adhesion. In terms of mechanism, however, these findings are difficult to interpret because of the potential for direct effects on NCAM protein conformation, local steric hindrance (11Yang P. Major D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23039-23044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the positive influence of PSA on NCAM-heparin sulfate proteoglycan binding (35Storms S.D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27124-27129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Moreover, the domains that mediate NCAM homophilic binding also contain other activities and structural features of the protein. Therefore, it is possible that the biology of PSA includes not only a global regulation of cell interactions, but also other effects transmitted through NCAM. But could such effects on NCAM contribute to the observed regulation by PSA of other adhesion systems? The NCAM domain deletion studies reported here address this issue by systematically removing the sites of all known NCAM activities (other than polysialylation) and showing that even with these extensive deletions the PSA-mediated inhibition of cadherin and L1 IgCAM homophilic adhesion is identical to that obtained with intact PSA-NCAM. It should be noted that the two FNIII domains in NCAM were not deleted (at least one of them is required for polysialylation). Therefore, although no activity or notable structural feature has been reported for these domains, either in the intact molecule or as isolated units, we are not able to rule out this possibility. One logical role for these domains might be a homophilic affinity among NCAMs on the same cell. While such an activity could well result in augmentation of NCAM-mediated adhesion, its regulation by PSA would not be expected to affect other adhesion systems. Finally, it is important to remember that this study is limited to effects of PSA on cell adhesion. Therefore the results obtained cannot exclude the possibility that PSA might have other biological activities, such as effects on neurotrophic factor efficacy (36Muller D. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Jourdain P. Vutskits L. Durbec P. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4315-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) or a direct affinity for matrix components (35Storms S.D. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27124-27129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), which may or may not involve direct participation by the NCAM polypeptide. In summary, the present studies tackle a difficult logistical problem, trying to provide strong evidence in favor of mechanism for regulation of molecular and cellular function that is not based on binding or enzymatic activity. While some minor caveats remain, the consistency and breadth of the regulation obtained under the stringent criteria and extensive manipulations employed here should provide a basis for interpretation of PSAs role in most biological contexts."

However, a recent in vitro study indicated that peroxynitrite exhibits poor nitrating efficiency at biologically relevant steady-state concentrations (Pfeiffer, S., Schmidt, K., and Mayer, B. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 6346–6352). To investigate the molecular mechanism of protein tyrosine nitration in intact cells, murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were activated with immunological stimuli, causing inducible NO synthase expression (interferon-γ in combination with either lipopolysaccharide or zymosan A), followed by the determination of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine levels and release of potential triggers of nitration (NO, O⨪2, H2O2, peroxynitrite, and nitrite). Levels of 3-nitrotyrosine started to increase at 16–18 h and exhibited a maximum at 20–24 h post-stimulation. Formation of O⨪2 was maximal at 1–5 h and decreased to base line 5 h after stimulation. Release of NO peaked at ∼6 and ∼9 h after stimulation with interferon-γ/lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ/zymosan A, respectively, followed by a rapid decline to base line within the next 4 h. NO formation resulted in accumulation of nitrite, which leveled off at about 50 μm 15 h post-stimulation. Significant release of peroxynitrite was detectable only upon treatment of cytokine-activated cells with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate, which led to a 2.2-fold increase in dihydrorhodamine oxidation without significantly increasing the levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. Tyrosine nitration was inhibited by azide and catalase and mimicked by incubation of unstimulated cells with nitrite. Together with the striking discrepancy in the time course of NO/O⨪2 release versus 3-nitrotyrosine formation, these results suggest that protein tyrosine nitration in activated macrophages is caused by a nitrite-dependent peroxidase reaction rather than peroxynitrite.

However, overproduction of NO appears to contribute essentially to tissue injury in inflammatory and ischemic conditions (1Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 453-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). One of the mechanisms by which excess NO can injure tissues is by its nearly diffusion-controlled reaction with O⨪2to give peroxynitrite, a potent oxidant thought to be a key mediator of NO-mediated tissue injury in atherosclerosis, congestive heart failure, glutamate excitotoxicity, and other disease states involving inflammatory oxidative stress (2Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1996; 40: C1424-C1437Crossref Google Scholar). There are several pieces of evidence implicating peroxynitrite as toxic agent in these pathologies as follows. (i) All of these diseases are associated with increased expression of inducible NO synthase, resulting in sustained formation of NO over relatively long periods of time, (ii) oxidative stress causes increased generation of O⨪2, (iii) authentic peroxynitrite triggers tyrosine nitration of a wide variety of proteins known to subserve important cellular functions that are lost upon nitration, and (iv) 3-nitrotyrosine levels have been observed in the injured tissues by both immunohistochemical techniques and quantitative analyses with HPLC1 or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (3Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Despite this apparently conclusive link between oxidative tissue injury, peroxynitrite, and tyrosine nitration, direct evidence for peroxynitrite-mediated nitration in vivo is still lacking (4Halliwell B. Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radical Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 5van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Shigenaga M.K. Cross C.E. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This is of particular relevance because recent in vitro studies suggest that co-generation of NO and O⨪2, an obviously better approximation to the in vivo situation than bolus addition of concentrated peroxynitrite solutions, does not cause significant nitration of free tyrosine (6van der Vliet A.

Although all of those studies, performed in four independent laboratories with a number of different NO/O⨪2-generating systems including pulse radiolysis, gave essentially identical results, Sawa et al. (11Sawa T. Akaike T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) recently reported on highly efficient tyrosine nitration by low fluxes of NO/O⨪2. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. The striking difference between peroxynitrite generated in situ at relatively low fluxes and bolus addition of authentic peroxynitrite appears to be a consequence of the different steady-state concentrations that are achieved with the two experimental protocols; at low (submicromolar) steady-state concentrations, the reaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine was found to give almost exclusively dityrosine, i.e. the product of tyrosyl radical dimerization, whereas 3-nitrotyrosine is the major product at the fairly high concentrations of peroxynitrite that occur upon bolus addition of the authentic compound (8Pfeiffer S. Schmidt K. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6346-6352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed an alternative mechanism of tyrosine nitration with potential in vivo relevance (4Halliwell B. Zhao K. Whiteman M. Free Radical Res. 1999; 31: 651-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Heme peroxidases such as myeloperoxidase or eosinophil peroxidase have been shown to utilize H2O2 to oxidize nitrite to a reactive nitrogen oxide species that triggers nitration of protein tyrosine residues and other phenolic compounds (12van der Vliet A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 13Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25933-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Since inflammatory processes are typically associated with an infiltration of phagocytes, which contain high levels of heme peroxidases, this pathway has to be considered as a possible alternative to peroxynitrite in mediating protein tyrosine nitration in vivo. Intriguingly, the dependence of peroxidase-catalyzed nitration on the local levels of NO2− and H2O2suggests that the peroxidase pathway operates under exactly the conditions that favor formation of peroxynitrite, i.e.increased formation of both NO and O⨪2, the reactive precursors of NO2− and H2O2, respectively. Thus, the experimental evidence currently available does not allow a decision as to which of the two pathways is responsible for tyrosine nitration in vivo. Although several in vitrostudies with NO/O⨪2-generating systems (see above) argue against peroxynitrite as a mediator of nitration, it should be emphasized that those studies were performed with highly artificialin vitro systems not necessarily reflecting the in vivo situation. As a first approach in addressing this issue, we attempted to clarify the cellular pathways mediating protein tyrosine nitration in cultured macrophages activated with established immunological stimuli. As a model system we used the murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. These cells are known to express high levels of inducible NO synthase and 3-nitrotyrosine-like immunoreactivity in response to immunological challenge with IFN-γ in combination with LPS or zymosan (15Shigenaga M.K. Lee H.H. Blount B.C. Christen S. Shigeno E.T. Yip H. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3211-3216Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Upon cell activation, we measured several key parameters of the NO/O⨪2/peroxynitrite pathway as a function of time and compared the data with protein tyrosine nitration. These experiments revealed a striking discrepancy in the time course of NO formation and nitration and showed that peroxidase inhibitors as well as catalase attenuated the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine, whereas peroxynitrite scavengers had no significant effects. Based on these results we suggest that tyrosine nitration in cytokine-activated macrophages is mediated by a peroxidase/nitrite pathway rather than NO/O⨪2-derived peroxynitrite.

Southam E. Boulton C.L. Nielsen E.B. Schmidt K. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 184-188PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence (∼5 × 107 cells/dish) and incubated for up to 48 h in the presence of IFN-γ (50 units/ml) and either LPS (0.5 μg/ml) or zymosan A (0.5 mg/ml) in fresh phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the time points indicated in the text and graphs, the activated cells were assayed for the following parameters: nitrite accumulation in the culture medium, release of NO, O⨪2, and H2O2, DHR oxidation, and intracellular levels of protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine. The concentration of nitrite in the cell culture supernatants was determined photometrically with the Griess assay as described previously (18Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K. Werner E.R.

The culture medium was removed, and the cells (one Petri dish for each measurement) were washed with PBS, harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. NO release was continuously monitored with a Clark-type NO-sensitive electrode (Iso-NO, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany) at 37 °C in disposable tubes (19Schmidt K. Mayer B. Titherage M.A. Nitric Oxide Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1997: 101-109Google Scholar). After 1 min, 5 μl of a 0.1m solution of l-arginine (final concentration, 1 mm) was injected. NO formation was quantified from the initial release rates obtained after injection ofl-arginine using the Macintosh CHART software. Rates of O⨪2release were measured as PEG-SOD-inhibitable reduction of acetylated cytochrome c as described (20Lass A. Argawal S. Sohal R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19199-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, the cells were washed three times and equilibrated for 30 min in PBS followed by incubation with 10 μm acetylated cytochrome c for 45 min with and without 150 units of PEG-SOD/ml. The cell supernatants were centrifuged at 1,300 ×g for 3 min followed by the determination of the absorbance at 550 nm against PEG-SOD-containing blanks. PEG-SOD inhibited total cytochrome c reduction by ∼80%. O⨪2 release was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 27,700m−1 × cm−1 at 550 nm (21Ernster L. Dallner G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Formation of H2O2 was measured as horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of fluorescent scopoletin as described (22De la Harpe J. Nathan C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 78: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, macrophages were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 45 min with an assay mixture containing 30 μm scopoletin, 1 mmNaN3, and 10 units/ml horseradish peroxidase in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer. Supernatants were centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 3 min followed by the determination of the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 305 and 470 nm, respectively. The fluorescence of the assay mixture without cells was subtracted as the blank. The method was calibrated with standard solutions of H2O2 adjusted photometrically using an extinction coefficient of 40 m−1 × cm−1 at 240 nm. Oxidation of DHR was determined as a measure of peroxynitrite formation (23Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). At the indicated time points, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 45 min in PBS containing 0.1 mm DHR and 0.1 mm of the metal chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The cell supernatants were centrifuged at 1,300 ×g for 3 min followed by determination of the absorbance at 500 nm against blank samples obtained by incubation of the assay mixture without cells. DHR oxidation was calculated using an extinction coefficient of 78,800 m−1 × cm−1at 500 nm (23Crow J.P. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine was determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection after derivatization toN-AcATyr following a protocol described recently (24Shigenaga M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The cells were homogenized in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and adjusted to a protein concentration of 16–30 mg of protein/ml. Protein was determined with the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar). Homogenates (0. 5 ml) were precipitated with 0.6 ml of HPLC grade acetonitrile, thoroughly vortexed and centrifuged (1000 × g), followed by resuspension of the precipitates in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and sonication for ∼10 s at 50 watts. This procedure was repeated three times to efficiently wash out non-protein material. The final suspensions were incubated overnight (16–20 h) at 50 °C with 1–2 mg of pronase and 0.5 mm CaCl2. Subsequently, 350-μl aliquots of the samples were centrifuged (20,000 × g), and an equal volume of 3 mphosphate buffer, pH 9.6, was added followed by the addition of 25 μl of acetic anhydride. After 10 min of incubation at ambient temperature, ethyl acetate (1 ml) and formic acid (0.2 ml) were added. The samples were thoroughly vortexed for 30 s and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 min. The ethyl acetate phase was concentrated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2 at 50 °C. For deacetylation of the phenolic acetate group, the samples were resuspended in 1 n NaOH (60 μl). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, 60 μl of 1 m phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was added followed by the addition of 0.1 m sodium dithionite (10 μl) to reduce the nitro substituent to the corresponding amine. The samples were incubated for 10 min at ambient temperature, acidified by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (20 μl), and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min in centrifuge tube filters. Aliquots (100 μl) were injected onto a 250 × 4 mm C18 reversed phase HPLC column (LiChrospher 100 RP-18, 5-μm particle size, Merck) and eluted with 10 mm H3PO4 at 0.7 ml/min. The performance of the column decreased gradually over time. This loss in resolution was overcome by supplementing the solvent with up to 2% (v/v) methanol. N-AcATyr was detected electrochemically with an ESA Coulochem II detector. The potentials of the two electrodes were set to −70 mV and +70 mV (versus palladium), respectively. The method was calibrated daily with authentic N-AcATyr (5–500 nm) prepared as described (24Shigenaga M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 301: 27-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The recovery of authentic 3-nitrotyrosine added to homogenates of resting RAW 264.7 macrophages was 69.3 ± 12.8%. To visualize 3-nitrotyrosine formation, RAW 264.7 macrophages were subjected to immunostaining with a monoclonal antibody. The cells were grown to confluence onl-polylysine-treated cover slides followed by activation with IFN-γ/Zy in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. After 14 h of activation the test compounds (methionine, 0.25 mm; MnTBAP, 50 μm; KCN, 0, 25 mm; NaN3, 0, 25 mm, and PEG-Cat, 2000 units/ml) were added followed by incubation for a further 10 h. As a negative control, non-activated macrophages were incubated under identical conditions for 24 h. For positive control, the cells were treated with authentic peroxynitrite (1 mm) for 1 h. After incubation, the cover slides were gently rinsed three times with PBS and fixed for 1 h with a solution, pH 6.5, containing Na2HPO4 (6.5 g/liter), NaH2PO4 (4 g/liter), (v/v) 15 ml/liter methanol (15 ml/liter; v/v), and formaldehyde (100 ml of 37%/liter, v/v). Thereafter, cover slides were gently rinsed three times with PBS. The 3-nitrotyrosine antibody was diluted to 10 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v). 50 μl of this solution were carefully applied to each cover slide to cover the entire surface and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C under humidified atmosphere. After gentle rinsing of the cover slides three times with PBS, 50 μl of biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (part of the mouse ExtrAvidin peroxidase staining kit obtained from Sigma diluted 1/20 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) were applied on the cover slides and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere. Then cover slides were again gently rinsed three times with PBS followed by the application of 100 μl of ExtrAvidin peroxidase (10 μg/ml in PBS) on each cover slide and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C under humidified atmosphere and rinsing of the slides with PBS. The staining solution was prepared by mixing 0.2 ml of 20 mg of 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole in 2.5 ml of dimethylformamide with 3.8 ml of 0.05 m acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Before use, 20 μl of 3% (v/v) H2O2 were added to the staining solution, and 100 μl were applied on the cover slides until the appropriate color development (3–4 min). Reactions were terminated by rinsing the slides gently with distilled water. Cell homogenates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% slab gels (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.3, containing 192 mm glycine, 0.02% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol at 250 mA for 90 min. Unspecific binding sites were saturated by overnight incubation of the membranes at 4 °C in TBST containing 3% (w/v) ovalbumin. Subsequently, the membranes were washed twice for 5 min followed by incubation for 2 h with the anti-myeloperoxidase antibody diluted 1:500 in TBST containing 0.3% (w/v) ovalbumin. Subsequently, the membranes were washed twice for 15 min with TBST and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit-IgG antibody that had been diluted 1:5000 in TBST buffer containing 0.3% (w/v) ovalbumin. Finally, the membranes were washed three times for 20 min with TBST buffer and processed with the ECL Western-blotting detection system according to the recommendations of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Unless otherwise indicated, release rates are expressed as amounts of product (pmol or pg)/min/mg of total cell protein. Results are the mean values ± S.E. ofn experiments as indicated in the figure legends. The statistical significance of the data shown in Fig. 6 was evaluated by analysis of variance using Fisher's protected least significant difference test. Activation of RAW 264.7 macrophages with either IFN-γ/LPS or IFN-γ/Zy led to a pronounced release of NO accompanied by an accumulation of nitrite in the cell culture media. As shown in Fig.1 A, the maximal rates of NO release were 116.2 ± 15.0 and 90.9 ± 11.5 pmol × min−1 × mg−1 at 7 and 9 h after stimulation with IFN-γ/LPS and IFN-γ/Zy, respectively. Note that with both stimuli, NO release was virtually back to base line after 14 h of incubation. The inset in Fig. 1 Ashows that NO release was markedly increased upon the addition ofl-arginine, an observation that agrees well with previous studies reporting on a pronounced dependence of macrophage NO synthesis on extracellular substrate supply (27Hibbs J.B. Vavrin Z. Taintor R.R. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 550-565PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stuehr D.J. Gross S.S. Sakuma I. Levi R. Nathan C.F. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1011-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). NO release was not significantly affected by the addition of SOD (1000 units/ml). The signal rapidly declined to zero upon the addition of the NO scavenger hemoglobin, demonstrating the specificity of the Clark-type NO electrode. The time course of nitrite accumulation in the cell culture supernatant was virtually identical with both combinations of stimuli (Fig.1 B). Nitrite levels progressively increased from 4 to 15 h of incubation followed by a plateau corresponding to nitrite concentrations of about 50 μm. Conversion of the rates of NO release from macrophages activated with either cytokine combination (Fig. 1 A) to accumulating concentrations revealed that the decrease in the rates of NO release is in good accordance with the observed reduction in the rate of nitrite accumulation; based on the nitrite data, the apparent recovery of NO detected with the Clark electrode was ∼50% (not shown). These results indicate that macrophage NO synthesis ceased after about 15 h of cell activation, presumably due to inducible NO synthase inactivation and/or limiting cofactor supply. Interestingly, the small but significant rightward shift of the time course of NO release from macrophages activated with IFN- γ/Zy- as compared with that from IFN-γ/LPS-stimulated cells was not paralleled by a significant difference in the time course of nitrite accumulation, suggesting that specific intracellular pathways may affect net NO release from activated macrophages. The differences in the kinetics of O⨪2release were considered as an obvious explanation. Activation of macrophages with IFN-γ/Zy led to a burst of O⨪2 production (26.5 ± 3.5 pmol × min−1 × mg−1) during the first hour of stimulation followed by a steady decline that reached basal rates (∼2 pmol × min−1 × mg−1) after 7 h (Fig. 2 A). Release of O⨪2 from cells stimulated with IFN-γ/LPS was much less pronounced. The maximal rate of 12.8 ± 1.6 pmol × min−1 × mg−1 observed 2 h post-stimulation had declined to basal rates 4 h after stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the time course of H2O2 formation was similar to that of O⨪2 with both stimulation protocols, but the overall fluxes were ∼1000-fold higher (note the different scales in the twoy axes of Fig. 2 B). We considered the possibility that the apparent decrease in O⨪2formation was a consequence of a rapid reaction of O⨪2 with NO to yield peroxynitrite and carried out two sets of experiments to test this hypothesis. First, we repeated the experiments shown in Fig.2 A using cells treated with a high concentration of a non-selective NO synthase inhibitor (L-NNA; 1 mm). L-NNA almost completely inhibited nitrite accumulation in the cell culture supernatant (data not shown) but had no effect on the rates of O⨪2 release measured 7 h after cell stimulation (inset to Fig. 2 A). Secondly, we determined the time course of DHR oxidation as a measure for peroxynitrite formation. Neither of the two protocols of macrophage activation (IFN-γ/LPS and IFN-γ/Zy) resulted in a considerable increase in the rates of DHR oxidation (1–3 pmol × min−1 × mg−1), which was insensitive to L-NNA (data not shown). Together, these results argue against peroxynitrite as a major reactive nitrogen species formed by activated macrophages. Protein-bound 3-nitrotyrosine was measured in the cell extracts as the N-acetyl-amino derivative (N-AcATyr). As expected, treatment of macrophages with authentic peroxynitrite (1 mm final) resulted in a pronounced increase in tyrosine nitration from 19.4 ± 17.3 to 855.9 ± 270.2 pg of N-AcATyr/mg of cellular protein (n = 3 each). Fig. 3shows that a significant increase in nitration was also observed upon activation of the macrophages with either IFN-γ/Zy or IFN-γ/LPS. The time course of N-AcATyr formation was similar with both combinations of stimuli, although IFN-γ/Zy led to about a 3-fold higher product formation than IFN-γ/LPS (385.3 ± 77.8 and 127.9 ± 8.7 pg × mg−1, respectively). Nitration occurred with a pronounced lag phase of 6 (IFN-γ/Zy) to 18 h (IFN-γ/LPS), was maximal 24 h post-stimulation, and slowly declined during the next 24 h. Thus, we observed a pronounced difference in the time course of protein tyrosine nitration and NO/O⨪2 formation such that nitration started to increase at a time when the rates of NO/O⨪2 had already declined close to basal levels. These results argue against peroxynitrite as a mediator of tyrosine nitration in activated macrophages. However, because of the apparent lack of peroxynitrite formation, as evident from the lack of significant D"

Clotrimazole, a membrane-permeant triarylmethane, blocked IKCa1 with equal affinity when applied externally or internally, whereas a membrane-impermeant derivative TRAM-30 blocked the channel only when applied to the cytoplasmic side, indicating an internal drug-binding site. Introduction of the S5-P-S6 region of the triarylmethane-insensitive small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel SKCa3 into IKCa1 rendered the channel resistant to triarylmethanes. Replacement of Thr250 or Val275 in IKCa1 with the corresponding SKCa3 residues selectively abolished triarylmethane sensitivity without affecting the affinity of the channel for tetraethylammonium, charybdotoxin, and nifedipine. Introduction of these two residues into SKCa3 rendered the channel sensitive to triarylmethanes. In a molecular model of IKCa1, Thr250 and Val275 line a water-filled cavity just below the selectivity filter. Structure-activity studies suggest that the side chain methyl groups of Thr250 and Val275 may lock the triarylmethanes in place via hydrophobic interactions with the π-electron clouds of the phenyl rings.

IKCa1 channels are voltage-independent, and their activation is steeply sensitive to rises in intracellular Ca2+, calcium sensitivity being conferred by calmodulin tightly complexed to the C terminus of the channel (5Fanger C.M.

Pharmacologically, IKCa1 channels are distinguished from SKCa (SKCa1–3) channels by their sensitivity to clotrimazole and charybdotoxin and by their insensitivity to apamin. In mitogen-activated human lymphocytes, IKCa1 regulates membrane potential and calcium signaling, and selective inhibitors of IKCa1 suppress lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion by attenuating Ca2+ influx (4Ghanshani S.

Erythrocyte dehydration in sickle cell disease can be attributed partly to excessive K+ loss through IKCa1 channels that are activated by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ during sickling (10Brugnara C. Current Opin. Hematol. 1997; 4: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Clotrimazole and ICA-15451, two potent triarylmethane (TRAM) blockers of this channel, are in clinical trials for the treatment of sickle cell disease (11Brugnara C. Gee B. Armsby C.C. Kurth S.

In intestinal and airway epithelium cells, basolateral expression of the IKCa1 channel modulates apical water and Cl− secretion (13Rufo P.A. Jiang L. Moe S.J. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Lencer W.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzel R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen.

Riegler M. Ferguson-Maltzman M.H. Dickinson B.L. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. Lencer W.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3111-3120Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, the therapeutic usefulness of clotrimazole is seriously limited by its nanomolar affinity for cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes, especially CYP3A4 (the major xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme in human liver), which leads to a high incidence of side effects (11Brugnara C. Gee B. Armsby C.C. Kurth S. Sakamoto M. Rifai N. Alper S.L. Platt O.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16Sawyer P.R. Brogden R.N. Pinder R.M. Speight T.M. Avery G.S. Drugs. 1975; 9: 424-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Starting with clotrimazole as a template, we recently designed and synthesized TRAM analogs that block IKCa1 potently and specifically without inhibiting P450-dependent enzymes (8Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hänsel W. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8151-8156Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The most potent of these, TRAM-34, blocks IKCa1 with a K d of 20 nm and exhibits exquisite selectivity for the channel. Related TRAMs containing tetrazole (TRAM-84) or acetonitrile (TRAM-39) in place of the pyrazole are also selective and potent inhibitors of IKCa1. Although applied externally, the TRAMs are readily membrane-permeant because of their high lipophilicity (logP value 3.5–5.0) and may interact with a site on the inner face of the channel. Furthermore, a membrane-impermeant clotrimazole analog has been reported previously to block the native IKCa channel in erythrocytes only when applied to the cytoplasmic surface, suggesting an internal binding site (17Dunn P.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used molecular chimeras and mutagenesis to identify the channel residues that interact with the TRAM inhibitors. Clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, nifedipine, and TEA were purchased from Sigma. Charybdotoxin (ChTX) was from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). TRAM-34 ([1-(2-chlorophenyl)diphenyl)methyl]-1H-pyrazole), TRAM-3 ((2-chlorophenyl)diphenylmethanol), and TRAM-39 (2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,2-diphenylacetonitrile) were synthesized as described previously (8Wulff H.

TRAM-30 was prepared by refluxing clotrimazole (2.00 g, 5.81 mmol) with an excess of methyl iodide in butanone for 36 h. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness. On addition of petroleum ether to the resulting oily residue and intensive cooling and scratching, the material began to solidify and was then washed thoroughly with acetone and petroleum ether (mp: 139 °C; 1H NMR (300 MHz, Me2SO): δ 9.13 (s, 1H, -(2-H), 7.72 (s, 1H), 7.48–7.41 (m, 9H), 7.27–7.21 (m, 5H), 6.96 (s, 1H), 4.26 (s, 3H, N+-CH3); MS (70eV)m/z 277 (52), 254 (13Rufo P.A.

Both channel genes were subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) in frame with GFP. Mutant IKCa1 channels were generated by either one- or two-step polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with HindIII/BbrPI and cloned intoHindIII/BbrPI-cut GFP-IKCa1. ForSKCa3 mutations, KpnI and a C-terminal-introducedBamHI site were used. All clones were verified by sequencing. The DNA for transfection was prepared with the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) mini-prep kit. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm Na+ pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transiently transfected with GFP-tagged wild-type or mutantIKCa1 and SKCa3 cDNAs using FuGene™ 6 (Roche) according to manufacturer protocol. Cells were trypsinized 16–72 h after transfection, plated onto polylysine-coated coverslips, and used within the next 4 h. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (EPC-9, HEKA Elektronik) were made at a holding potential of −80 mV with a pipette solution containing 145 mm K+aspartate, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm K2EGTA, and 8.5 mmCaCl2 (1 µm free [Ca2+]), pH 7.2, 290–310 mosm. To reduce currents from the native chloride channels in COS-7, Na+ aspartate Ringer was used as an external solution containing 160 mm Na+aspartate, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 290–310 mosm. Currents were elicited by 200-ms voltage ramps from −120 to 40 mV applied every 10 s, and the reduction of slope conductance at −80 mV by drug was taken as a measure of channel block. The recordings in Fig. 1were done on excised inside-out patches with the external solution described above as pipette solution. K+ aspartate solutions containing 1 µm and 50 nm free [Ca2+] were applied to the cytoplasmic side of the patch. IKCa1 channels are potently blocked by clotrimazole and related TRAMs with a Hill coefficient of unity. These highly lipophilic compounds readily cross the plasma membrane and block the channel with a slow onset. An earlier study (17Dunn P.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that used a membrane-impermeant clotrimazole analog on the native IKCa channel in erythrocytes reported a drug-binding site on the cytoplasmic surface of the channel. To confirm this prediction on the cloned channel we generated a membrane-impermeant quaternary TRAM (TRAM-30) and evaluated its ability to block IKCa1 when added from the outside (in the whole-cell configuration) or the intracellular side in inside-outside patches. As a control we studied clotrimazole (logP = 3.5), which is freely membrane-permeant. Currents (10–200 pA) in inside-out patches from IKCa1-expressing COS-7 cells excised into 1 µm Ca2+ disappeared when the Ca2+ concentration was reduced to 50 nm and were restored after the re-addition of 1 µmCa2+ (Fig. 1 A). This Ca2+-activated current was completely and rapidly blocked by 1 µm clotrimazole (Fig. 1, A andB), and its K+ selectivity was confirmed by the shift in reversal potential when the Na+ aspartate pipette solution was replaced by K+ aspartate (Fig.1 C). These IKCa1 currents were also reversibly blocked by the membrane-impermeant quaternary compound, TRAM-30 (Fig. 1,D and E) with a K d of 700 nm (Fig. 1 F, Δ), which was almost ineffective (K d = 350 µm, ▴) when applied to the external surface of the channel in the whole-cell configuration. In contrast, the membrane-permeant clotrimazole blocked the channel with equal potency when applied to either side of the membrane (Fig.1 F, ▪ and ■). The 10-fold lower potency of TRAM-30 compared with clotrimazole is caused by the bulk of the additional methyl group on the imidazole ring, consistent with the published pharmacophore of the TRAMs (8Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hänsel W. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8151-8156Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TRAMs interact with a site on the intracellular surface of the channel. To localize the region on the channel to which the TRAMs bind, we generated a chimera between IKCa1 and the phylogenetically related TRAM-insensitive small conductance SKCa3 channel (Fig.2A). In whole-cell recordings, IKCa1 currents were potently blocked by externally applied TRAM-34 (Fig. 2 A, left), whereas SKCa3 was insensitive (Fig. 2 A, middle). A chimera containing the SKCa3 S5-P-S6 region in the IKCa1 body was insensitive to 1 µmTRAM-34 (Fig. 2 A, right). Together with the data obtained in inside-out experiments (see above), these results suggest that the TRAM-binding site is situated on the cytoplasmic side of the S5-P-S6 region of IKCa1. An alignment of the IKCa1 and SKCa3 amino acid sequences through this region reveals 45 differences (Fig. 2 B). To define the residues involved we replaced IKCa1 residues with the corresponding ones from SKCa3. Mutations were made in the cytoplasmic half of S5, the intracellular portion of the P-loop and the entire S6 segment, and as a control we also mutated residue 239 that had been shown previously to be involved in ChTX binding (20Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Mutations involving Thr250 (P245S + T250S; or T250S) or Val275(V275A +C276G; or V275A) abolished sensitivity to TRAM-34 and clotrimazole, whereas all other mutants showed unchanged TRAM-34 sensitivity (Fig. 2 B, TableI). The V272I mutant could not be investigated because it was nonfunctional.

The T250S mutant produced a K+-selective current equally sensitive to block by ChTX (K d = 5 ± 1 nm), TEA (K d = 20 ± 4 mm), and nifedipine (K d = 5 ± 1 µm) as the wild-type IKCa1 channel (4Ghanshani S.

Similar results were obtained with the V275A mutant (Fig. 3,E–H). Thus, these two point mutations selectively abolished TRAM-34 sensitivity without altering other pharmacological properties of the channel or its K+ selectivity, indicating that the overall conformation of these mutant channels had not been grossly perturbed. It also shows that the TRAM-binding site is distinct from those of ChTX, TEA, and nifedipine. The TRAM pharmacophore consists of two parts, a triphenyl moiety and either a small heterocycle or another π-electron-rich substituent such as an acetonitrile or hydroxyl group. To identify the part of the molecule that interacts with the channel, we first examined four TRAMs that contain the triphenyl moiety but different substituents, TRAM-34 (pyrazole), TRAM-39 (acetonitrile), TRAM-3 (hydroxyl), and clotrimazole (imidazole). All four compounds were inactive on the T250S and V275A mutant channels (Fig. 4). In contrast, two azole inhibitors of IKCa1 (econazole and ketoconazole) containing an imidazole moiety such as clotrimazole but lacking the triphenyl group blocked both mutant channels as effectively as the wild-type channel (Figs. 3 H and 4). Collectively, these results suggest that the triphenyl moiety interacts with Thr250 and Val275. If Thr250and Val275 constitute the TRAM-binding site, introduction of these residues into the SKCa3 channel should confer sensitivity to the TRAMs. The SKCa3-S507T+A532V mutant produced a K+-selective channel (Fig.5A) that was blocked by apamin with a potency roughly equal to the wild-type SKCa3 channel (Fig.5 B). Unlike SKCa3, which was relatively insensitive to TRAM-34 (K d = 28 µm), the S507T+A532V-SKCa3 mutant was substantially blocked by 1 and 5 µm TRAM-34 (K d = 680 ± 70 nm, Fig. 5, C and D). The positions of Thr250 and Val274 are highlighted in a published model of the IKCa1 pore (20Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) based on the KcsA crystal structure (Fig. 6). Both residues line a large water-filled cavity that lies just below the narrow selectivity filter of the channel, which is formed by the conserved GYG motif. If this cavity in IKCa1 is as wide as the 10-Å cavity in KcsA, it should easily accommodate clotrimazole and TRAM-34, both of which have dimensions of 9.5 × 9.5 × 8.6 Å. An AM-1-optimized structure of TRAM-34 drawn to scale is shown in Fig. 6 next to the channel model. A highly lipophilic membrane-permeant compound like TRAM-34 (logP = 4.0) could easily reach the internal cavity either by traversing the ion conduction pathway from the inside or through crevices and tunnels in the protein similar to those recently described in sodium channels (21Sato C. Ueno Y. Asai K. Takahashi K. Sato M. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2001; 409: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Using a combination of electrophysiology and mutagenesis we have defined the TRAM-binding site on IKCa1. Our data suggest that the binding site is located on the cytoplasmic side of the S5-P-S6 region of the channel. First, a membrane-impermeant analog blocks the channel with 500-fold greater potency when added from the insideversus the outside, and second, introduction of the S5-P-S6 region of the TRAM-resistant SKCa3 into IKCa1 renders the channel insensitive to these compounds. Single and multiple replacements of IKCa1 residues in the S5-P-S6 region with the corresponding residues in SKCa3 identified Thr250 in the P-region and Val275 in S6 as being critical for TRAM binding. Based on our IKCa1 model (20Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), both these residues lie in close proximity to each other in the water-filled cavity below the ion selectivity filter. The introduction of these two residues into SKCa3 made this channel TRAM-sensitive. Given the tetrameric nature of K+ channels, the TRAM-binding site could involve Thr250 and Val275 from more than one subunit. The exquisite selectivity of IKCa1 for the TRAMs is most likely caused by the tight interactions between the propeller-shaped TRAMs and the Thr250 and Val275 of multiple IKCa1 subunits. The three SKCa channels contain serine and alanine at positions equivalent to Thr250 and Val275, and these residues contribute to their TRAM insensitivity. Consistent with this idea, the introduction of Thr250 and Val275 into SKCa3 (SK3-S507T+A532V) produces an ∼40-fold enhancement in TRAM-34 sensitivity compared with the wild-type SKCa3 channel (Fig. 5). Other TRAM-resistant Kv (Kv1.1–1.5, 3.1, 4.2), Kir (Kir2.1), and BKCa (Slo) channels contain threonine and valine at positions homologous to Thr250 and Val275, although they share little sequence similarity with IKCa1 in the residues neighboring the threonine and valine (22Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar). The threonine and valine residues in these channels may be oriented differently from Thr250 and Val275 in IKCa1, resulting in a less than optimal interaction with the phenyl rings of TRAM-34. Differences in the shape of the internal cavities of these channels compared with IKCa1 may also contribute to TRAM insensitivity. Bulky residues in the vicinity of the threonine or valine in these channels may also sterically interfere with their ability to interact with TRAMs. In an earlier study, we proposed that the TRAM-binding site had dimensions of roughly 9.5 × 9.5 × 8.6 Å based on structure-activity relationships of the TRAMs; introduction of bulky substituents on the triphenyl moiety or on the heterocycle abolished affinity (8Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hänsel W. Grissmer S. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8151-8156Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Consistent with this earlier report, our heuristic model suggests that TRAM-34 could fit snugly into the internal cavity just below the selectivity filter with each of the phenyl rings locked in place by interactions with Thr250 and Val275from three of the four IKCa1 subunits. We propose that the π-electron cloud of the phenyl rings of TRAM-34 form hydrophobic interactions with the positively polarized hydrogen atoms of the methyl group of Thr250. The conservative substitution of serine in place of Thr250 abolishes TRAM sensitivity, possibly because serine lacks the side chain methyl group of threonine. Val275could also form a hydrophobic interaction with the phenyl rings. This interaction must be size-dependent, because the introduction of the smaller alanine (88 Å3) in place of the valine (140 Å3) abolishes TRAM sensitivity. Although each hydrophobic interaction in itself is weak, taken together they may well account for the 20 nm K d value of TRAM-34. Our model also predicts that the heterocyclic moiety could project upwards into the selectivity filter and occlude the ion conduction pathway. We would like to thank Ray Norton and Mark Lanigan for the generation of the IKCa1 model and Annabelle Chialing Wu and Hilda Fernandez for excellent technical assistance."

In this study, we identified four polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human MGP gene. Transfection studies showed that the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms have an important impact on in vitro promoter activity when transiently transfected into VSMCs. We found that one of these polymorphisms (T−138C) is significantly correlated with serum MGP levels in human subjects. Promoter deletion analysis showed that this polymorphism lies in a region of the promoter critical for transcription in VSMCs. This region contains a potential activating protein-1 (AP-1) binding element located between −142 and −136. We have demonstrated that the T−138C polymorphism results in altered binding of an AP-1 complex to this region. The −138T allelic variant binds AP-1 complexes consisting primarily of c-Jun, JunB and its partners Fra-1 and Fra-2 in rat VSMC. Furthermore, the −138T variant form of the promoter was induced following phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, while the −138C variant was refractive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, confirming that AP-1 factors preferentially bind to the −138T variant. This study therefore suggests that a common polymorphism of the MGP promoter influences binding of the AP-1 complex, which may lead to altered transcription and serum levels. This could have important implications for diseases such as atherosclerosis and aortic valve stenosis, since it strongly suggests a genetic basis for regulation of tissue calcification.

The concentration of calcium and phosphate ions in mammalian extracellular fluids are sufficiently high to induce precipitation of apatite, yet widespread tissue calcification does not usually occur in health (3Neuman W.F. Fundamental and Clinical Bone Physiology. Lippincott, Philadelphia1980Google Scholar). Protection against calcification during health is thought to be due, at least partly, to the complexing of calcium by organic bone-associated proteins such as matrix Gla protein (MGP)1 (4Schinke T. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 150-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). MGP is a mineral-binding extracellular matrix protein synthesized by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and chondrocytes (4Schinke T. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. Nat.

It belongs to a family of proteins that contain glutamyl residues that are post-translationally modified by a vitamin K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase into γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) residues (6Shanahan C.M. Proudfoot D. Farzaneh-Far A. Weissberg P.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These Gla residues promote binding to calcium and phosphate. Mice lacking MGP develop extensive arterial and valvular calcification, strongly suggesting that it acts as an inhibitor of tissue calcification (7Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that MGP is associated with areas of calcification in human atherosclerotic arteries perhaps as a homeostatic response to prevent further pathological calcification (8Shanahan C.M.

Furthermore, we have observed a similar association in cultured human VSMCs, which spontaneously form calcified nodules (11Proudfoot D. Skepper J.N. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These studies suggest a key regulatory role for MGP in tissue calcification, particularly in vascular tissues. Despite the importance of MGP as an inhibitor of calcification and its potential role in diseases such as atherosclerosis, little is known about its transcriptional regulation. We hypothesized that polymorphisms may be present in the promoter region of MGP that could result in interindividual variation in transcription and tissue expression. In this study, we identify a common promoter polymorphism of the MGP gene that leads to altered binding of an activating protein-1 (AP-1) complex and is associated with variations in in vitro expression and serum levels. Furthermore, we show that c-Jun, JunB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 are the dominant components of this AP-1 complex in vascular smooth muscle cells. DNA for the initial polymorphism identification was extracted from 40 subjects. Samples for the MGP assay and subsequent genotyping were obtained from 156 healthy subjects (55–65 years old) in Maastricht as described previously (12Braam L.A. Dissel P. Gijsbers B.L. Spronk H.M. Hamulyak K. Soute B.A. Debie W. Vermeer C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). 15 overlapping PCR primer pairs were used to amplify 3.3-kilobase pair DNA upstream of the MGP gene in 40 unrelated individuals. 5 µl of PCR product was added to 5 µl of loading dye (98% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 10 mm EDTA), denatured by heating to 95 °C for 8 min, and rapidly cooled on ice to preserve single-stranded structure. The denatured samples were loaded onto 6–8% acrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 5-watt constant power overnight. The gel reactions were carried out either at 4 °C or 20 °C. Fragments were visualized by silver staining. Whenever a persisting deviant pattern was observed, the samples were sequenced in order to identify the sequence polymorphism causing the shift. Genotyping for the G−7A polymorphism was performed by using a mismatch PCR fragment amplified with the forward primer (5′-CTAGTTCAGTGCCAACCCTTCCCCACC-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-TAGCAGCAGTAGGGAGAGAGGCTCCCA-3′), followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme NcoI. The T−138C polymorphism was genotyped using a mismatch PCR fragment amplified with the forward primer (5′-AAGCATACGATGGCCAAAACTTCTGCA-3′) and the reverse primer (5′-GAACTAGCATTGGAACTTTTCCCAACC-3′), followed by digestion with the restriction enzyme BsrSI. The PCRs were performed in a total volume of 25 µl of a buffer solution containing the following: 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm dNTP, 10 units ofTaq DNA polymerase, and 0.25 µm forward and reverse primers. For the G−7A polymorphism, the reaction was run with a 3-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 64 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. For the T−138C polymorphism, the reaction was run with a 3-min denaturation at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. MGP reporter plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. R. Schule (University of Freiburg, Germany). They consisted of progressive MGP promoter deletions (−3570, −530, −270, and −102) inserted into the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). MGP promoter constructs specific for the −7G and −138T mutations were generated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutated constructs were sequenced to confirm successful site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmid DNA was prepared using an endotoxin-free Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen). VSMCs were derived from adult Wistar rat aortas by enzyme dispersion as described previously (13Grainger D.J. Hesketh T.R. Metcalfe J.C. Weissberg P.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), glutamine (0.03%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 µg/ml). Transient transfection assays were carried out using the Superfect kit (Qiagen). VSMCs plated at 60% confluence on 60-mm plates were exposed for 2 h to 4 µg of MGP promoter-luciferase and 0.1 µg of Bos-β-galactosidase constructs (14Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) in the presence of 20 µl of Superfect solution and 1.2 ml of medium 199 (Sigma). Transfected cells were grown for 48 h after transfection before being harvested for analysis of luciferase activity. Briefly, the cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and harvested in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) followed by centrifugation to remove cellular debris. 100 µl of cell lysate was added to 468 µl of luciferase substrate buffer and luminescence measured in a luminometer (LB953; AutoLumat). The β-galactosidase was assayed using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in microtiter plates (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Luciferase expression was normalized against β-galactosidase activity to account for variation in transfection efficiency. All experiments were conducted in sextuplicate in four independent transfection experiments. When investigating the effects of PMA, transfected cells were grown for 24 h after transfection as described above, before treating with either 100 nm PMA or 0.1% ethanol vehicle for 2 h. The cells were then washed and grown for a further 24 h before being harvested for analysis of luciferase activity. MGP levels were measured in human serum samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (12Braam L.A. Dissel P. Gijsbers B.L. Spronk H.M. Hamulyak K. Soute B.A. Debie W. Vermeer C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The sense sequences for the oligonucleotides used were as follows: 138T, 5′-TGGAAGGAATGACTGTTTGGGAAAAGT-3′; 138C, 5′- TGGAAGGAATGACCGTTTGGGAAAAGT-3′; consensus TRE site incorporated into the MGP oligonucleotide, 5′-TGGAAGGAATGACTCATTGGGAAAAGT-3′; and mutated consensus TRE oligonucleotide, 5′-TGGAAGGAATGACCCATTGGGAAAAGT-3′. The mutated consensus AP-1 oligonucleotide has a substitution of a T for a C in the position corresponding to −138 in the MGP promoter. The probes were made by end-labeling single-stranded oligonucleotides with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The complementary strands were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotides were subsequently purified on Stratagene push columns (Stratagene). Binding reactions were carried out in 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Labeled DNA probe (100,000 cpm) was added to each reaction mixture containing 1 µg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) and 6 µg of protein from crude nuclear extract. Crude nuclear extract was prepared from rat VSMC by the method of Dignam (15Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). AP-1 control nuclear extracts from 3T3 and 3T6 cells were provided in the AP-1 family nushift kit (Geneka). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For the competition experiments, the same conditions were used except that the specific cold competitor oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture 10 min before the addition of the labeled probe. The sample was loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 30:1) gel and run at room temperature. For antibody supershift assays, 4 µg of nuclear extract were incubated with 2–4 µg of antibody obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) in the binding buffer described above. Alternatively, 4–6 µl of antibody provided in the AP-1 family Nushift kit (Geneka) was incubated in the binding buffer provided by Geneka. Labeled probe was then added for a further 20 min, and the sample run on a precooled gel. pc-Jun (sc-822X) is a monoclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated p39 c-Jun. Pan-cJun/AP-1 (sc-44X) is a polyclonal antibody directed against the highly conserved DNA binding domain of c-Jun and recognizes all known members of the Jun protein family. c-Jun (sc-45X) is a polyclonal antibody recognizing c-Jun only. The Fos gene family antibodies used were a pan-Fos monoclonal antibody (sc-447X), recognizing all members of the Fos protein family and specific polyclonal antibodies recognizing Fra-1 (sc-605X) and Fra-2 (sc-604X). Other antibodies used recognized pan-CREM-1 (sc-440X), ATF2 (sc-187X), pan-C/EBP (sc-746X), and c-Myb (sc-516X). Polyclonal antibodies in the AP-1 family nushift kit (Geneka) were reactive against c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, and FosB. Whole cell lysate was prepared from rat VSMCs that had been cultured for 24 h in medium containing 100 nm PMA or the same amount of ethanol vehicle. 30 µg of whole cell lysate was denatured in 2.5% SDS, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 62.5 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8) at 65 °C for 15 min, fractionated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The molecular mass measurements were based on Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated in PBS with 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated with antibodies specific to pc-Jun, JunB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 (1:5000–1:10,000) for 16 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig antibodies (NA934; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature and washed four times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 15 min each. The membrane was then incubated with ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and an exposure was made on Kodak XMR film. One-way ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyze MGP serum levels between the different genotypes. The observed genotype frequencies for the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms were compared with those expected under conditions of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the χ2 test. Student's unpaired t tests were used to compare relative luciferase activities in the transfection experiments. SSCP analysis of 15 overlapping PCR fragments upstream of the MGP gene in a cohort of 40 individuals revealed the presence of four deviant bands (Fig. 1a). Subsequent sequencing of these bands confirmed four polymorphic sites at nucleotide positions −7 (G or A), −138 (T or C), −514 (C or T), and −2447 (G or A). Fig. 2shows the approximate location of these polymorphisms on a schematic diagram of the MGP gene.Figure 2The structure of the human MGP gene 5′-flank (3.3 kilobase pairs) showing putative transcription factor binding sites.

This suggests that the sequence between −270 and −102 is critical for MGP transcription in VSMCs. Interestingly, the T−138C polymorphism lies in this region, suggesting that it may have significant effects on MGP expression. The influence of the two most common polymorphisms on gene expression was examined by using reporter gene constructs transiently transfected into VSMCs. These demonstrated independent impact of both common polymorphisms on transcriptional activity of the MGP gene (Fig. 4). The −7A variant had ∼1.5-fold higher activity than the −7G variant (p < 0.001), whereas the −138C variant had ∼4-fold higher activity than the −138T variant (p < 0.001). To test whether the MGP promoter polymorphisms had any effects on MGP levels in vivo, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed for the T−138C and G−7A polymorphisms on a sample of 156 healthy subjects in whom serum MGP had been assayed (Fig. 1 b). The T−514C and A−2447G polymorphisms were not investigated in this respect, since they were much less common (incidence of the rarer allele was <5%). The population frequencies of the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms were not significantly different from the distribution expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.5 andp > 0.1, respectively). There were highly significant variations in serum levels of MGP as a function of the T−138C polymorphism (ANOVA, p < 0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis test,p < 0.0001) but not the G−7A polymorphism (ANOVA,p = 0.67; Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.759) (Table Iand Fig.5). Thus, the CC variant at −138 was associated with higher mean serum levels of MGP (124.6 units/ml) than subjects with the TT variant (96.4 units/ml). A gene dose effect is also evident, with the CT heterozygotes having intermediate values (101.9 units/ml).Table IInfluence of the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms on serum MGP levels (mean ± S.D.)GenotypenMean MGP (S.D.)%units/ml−7 AA21 (13.5)97.4 (17.3)−7 GA70 (44.9)99.1 (19.1)−7 GG65 (41.6)101.3 (20.9)−138 CC10 (6.4)124.6 (10.9)−138 CT54 (34.6)101.9 (17.2)−138 TT92 (60.0)95.9 (19.5)The population frequencies of the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms were not significantly different from the distribution expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.1). Open table in a new tab The population frequencies of the G−7A and T−138C polymorphisms were not significantly different from the distribution expected from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.1). To investigate the possibility that the T−138C polymorphism alters binding of nuclear proteins, gel mobility shift assays were performed using oligonucleotides corresponding to the −138T and −138C alleles. Incubation of these oligonucleotides with nuclear extract from rat VSMCs produced a different pattern of protein-DNA complex formation for each variant of the T−138C polymorphism (Fig. 6). The −138C variant preferentially binds to complex B, whereas the −138T variant preferentially binds to complex A. Furthermore, complex A is preferentially eliminated by competition with cold −138T compared with competition with cold −138C. Similarly, complex B is preferentially reduced by competition with cold −138C compared with competition with cold −138T. These competition experiments demonstrate that the T−138C polymorphism alters the binding affinity of nuclear proteins for that region of the promoter. A data base search (TRANSFAC) (16Wingender E. Chen X. Hehl R. Karas H. Liebich I. Matys V. Meinhardt T. Pruss M. Reuter I. Schacherer F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) with the sequence of the MGP promoter in the vicinity of the T−138C polymorphism identified a potential AP-1 binding site between −136 and −142. Competition experiments demonstrated that increasing concentrations of cold consensus TRE oligonucleotides were able to compete effectively with the −138T radiolabeled oligonucleotide for binding complex A (Fig.7). In fact, cold consensus TRE oligonucleotide was a better competitor for the radiolabeled −138T oligonucleotide than either cold −138T or cold −138C (Fig. 7). Furthermore, when nuclear extract from 3T3 and 3T6 cells (which are known to contain AP-1 complexes) was used, the labeled consensus TRE oligonucleotide formed an intense complex in the same region as complex A (observed with labeled −138T oligonucleotide) (Fig.8). In contrast, labeled −138C oligonucleotide was a weak binder. Binding of the intense complex A is significantly reduced by mutation of T in the TRE consensus oligonucleotide (TGACTCA) to C (TGACCCA), corresponding to the T−138C polymorphism (Fig. 9). These experiments strongly suggest that AP-1 complex proteins are components of complex A in VSMCs and that the T in position −138 is critical for binding of the factors within complex A.Figure 8Gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extract from 3T3, 3T6, and VSMC cells. The extracts were incubated with γ-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the −138T allele, −138C allele, and consensus TRE binding site (MGP-TRE). Incubation of the −138T and consensus TRE oligonucleotides with nuclear extract from the different cell types produced protein-DNA complex with the same mobility shift as the −138T oligonucleotide. In contrast, the −138C labeled oligonucleotide does not bind, or only weakly binds, the nuclear proteins comprising complex A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9Gel mobility shift assay using γ-32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the −138T allele, −138C allele, MGP-TRE(T) allele, and MGP-mutTRE(C) allele. MGP-TRE(T) is identical with −138T except for the substitution of the TRE consensus binding sequence (-TGACTCA-) in place of the MGP putative AP-1 binding site (-TGACTGT-). MGP-mutTRE(C) is identical with MGP-TRE(T) except for substitution of a T for a C in a position corresponding to the T−138C polymorphic site (-TGACCCA-). Labeled DNA probe was added to each reaction mixture containing nuclear extract from rat VSMC cells. The consensus MGP-TRE(T) oligonucleotide forms a more intense complex in the same region as complex A when compared with MGP-TRE(C) and −138T labeled oligonucleotides. The binding in this intense complex is significantly reduced by mutation of T in the TRE consensus oligonucleotide (-TGACTCA-) to C (-TGACCCA-). These experiments strongly suggest that AP-1 complex proteins are components of complex A in VSMCs and that the T in position −138 is critical for binding of the factors within complex A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since AP-1 binding sites mediate the effects of phorbol esters, we evaluated the effects of the T−138C polymorphism on PMA stimulation of the −270 MGP promoter construct (Fig.10). 2 h of treatment with 100 nm PMA resulted in a statistically significant 1.6-fold increase in transcription of the −138T variant of the promoter (p = 0.008) transiently transfected into rat VSMCs. However, treatment with 100 nm PMA had no significant effect on transcription of the −138C variant of the promoter (p = 0.9). The components of the AP-1 complex binding to the −138T oligonucleotide were initially investigated by performing supershifts using antibodies reactive to c-Myb, pc-Jun, pan-Fos, pan-Jun, ATF-2, pan-CREM, and pan-C/EBP (Fig. 11). The pan-Jun antibody blocked the appearance of complex A, and anti-pc-Jun caused a strong clear supershift. The pan-Fos antibody also reduced the intensity of the shift, while those antibodies recognizing other factors had no effect (Fig. 11). Antibodies recognizing other components of AP-1 were used to further probe the identity of the constituent proteins in the rat VSMC complex A (Fig. 12). A blockshift was observed with the c-Jun polyclonal antibody, and the presence of c-Jun was confirmed by a strong supershift seen with the anti pc-Jun monoclonal antibody. Antibodies to JunB caused a supershift indicating its presence within the complex. Of the Fos family antibodies, FosB caused a weak supershift, whereas Fra-1 and Fra-2 blocked the lower and upper components of complex A, respectively (Fig. 12). The addition of both Fra-1 and Fra-2 antibodies resulted in an additive effect with a very extensive block shift (Fig. 12). A similar pattern of antibody reactivity and AP-1 binding was observed when labeled consensus TRE was used with rat nuclear extract (data not shown). Western blotting of rat VSMC with antibodies recognizing pc-Jun, JunB, Fra-1, and Fra-2 confirmed the presence of these proteins (Fig. 13). Furthermore, the level of pc-Jun protein increased following treatment with 100 nm PMA, when compared with ethanol vehicle alone (Fig.13). The present study has identified four novel polymorphisms in the promoter region of the human MGP gene. Transfection studies showed that the two most common of these have an important impact on in vitro promoter activity in rat VSMCs. Using MGP promoter deletion constructs, a region of the promoter critical for transcription was identified as being between −270 and −102. Interestingly, this key region contained the T−138C polymorphism. The importance of this region is consistent with the finding that the T−138C polymorphism has the greatest effect on in vitro transcription in VSMCs. Furthermore, the functional relevance of the T−138C polymorphism was demonstrated by the presence of significant differences in serum concentrations of MGP between the different allelic variants. This study therefore strongly suggests a genetic basis for variations in MGP transcription and serum levels. The differing constitutive expression of the −138T and −138C luciferase constructs as well as the different serum levels associated with the T−138C polymorphic variants appears to be paralleled by altered ability to bind nuclear factors (Fig. 6). Nuclear complex A binds preferentially to the −138T variant, whereas nuclear complex B binds preferentially to the −138C variant. The T−138C polymorphism occurs in a region (−142 to −136) with partial homology to a TRE. The consensus TRE sequence TGA(C/G)TCA is known to bind the AP-1 transcription factor complex in many genes and is defined by its ability to mediate phorbol ester-dependent induction of transcription (17Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a collective term for a range of nuclear factors that bind the TRE as dimers. Members of the Jun gene family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) bind as homo- or heterodimers, while members from the Fos gene family (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2) form heterodimers with Jun (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar). In addition, certain members of the ATF, CREB/CREM, Maf, Nrl, and JBP1/2 transcription factors can form leucine zipper dimers with Jun and/or Fos and bind a more diverse range of cis elements (18Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2289) Google Scholar,19Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3149-3158PubMed Google Scholar).

Axin functions as a scaffold protein in this complex by directly binding to GSK-3β, β-catenin, and APC. Interaction of GSK-3β with Axin in the complex facilitates efficient phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β. Phosphorylated β-catenin forms a complex with Fbw1 (βTrCP/FWD1), a member of the F-box protein family, resulting in the degradation of β-catenin by the ubiquitin and proteasome pathways (14Kitagawa M.

In addition, APC and Axin are also phosphorylated by GSK-3β in the Axin complex. Phosphorylation of APC enhances its binding to β-catenin (17Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S.

When cells are stimulated by Wnt, a cytoplasmic protein, Dvl, antagonizes the action of GSK-3β.

CKI comprises a large family of related gene products, α, β, γ, δ, and ε (47Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Each shares at least 50% amino acid identity within the protein kinase catalytic domain. Distinct CKI family members are likely to show different tissue distributions and subcellular localization and to have distinct roles including the regulation of DNA repair, DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and circadian rhythm (47Gross S.D.

Cell. 1998; 94: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). It has been reported that among CKI family, CKIε and δ but not CKIα are involved in the Wnt signaling pathway (49Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M.

A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CKIε in Xenopus embryos induces the expression of siamois, a Wnt response gene, and axis duplication. These CKIε-dependent responses are suppressed by Axin and GSK-3β, and Dvl-induced axis duplication is inhibited by CKI-7, a CKI inhibitor (49Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CKIε forms a complex with Dvl and Axin, and CKIε activates Lef-1, which is inhibited by Axin in mammalian cells (50Sakanaka C. Leong P. Xu L. Harrison S.D. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12548-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CKIε positively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway by functioning between Dvl and GSK-3β. However, the mode of action of CKIε is not understood. Here we demonstrate that by complex formation with Axin, CKIε and Dvl synergistically accumulate β-catenin and activate Tcf in mammalian cells and that they also synergistically induce axis duplication inXenopus embryos. Furthermore, we show that the binding of CKIε to Dvl is necessary for their synergistic action. These results demonstrate that the binding of the complex of CKIε and Dvl to Axin activates the Wnt signaling pathway.

To determine whether CKIε forms a complex with Dvl-1 or Axin at endogenous level, L cells (100-mm-diameter dish) were lysed in 200 µl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol), and the lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (20 µg of protein) was probed with the anti-Axin, anti-Dvl, anti-CKIε, and anti-GSK-3β antibodies to detect the protein expression levels. The same lysates (400 µg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the normal rabbit serum, the anti-Dvl antibody, or the anti-Axin antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-Axin, anti-Dvl, anti-CKIε, and anti-GSK-3β antibodies. To demonstrate the complex formation of CKIε, rAxin, Dvl-1, APC, GSK-3β, and β-catenin in intact cells, COS cells (60-mm-diameter dish) transfected with pBJ-Myc-, pEF-BOS-Myc-, pCGN-, pcDNA3-FLAG-, and pEGFP-derived plasmids were lysed in 250 µl of the lysis buffer. The supernatant (20 µg of protein) was probed with the anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-FLAG (M2), anti-CKIε, anti-GSK-3β, and anti-β-catenin antibodies to detect the protein expression levels. The same lysates (200 µg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc, anti-HA, or anti-GFP antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were probed with the anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-FLAG (M2), anti-CKIε, anti-GSK-3β, and anti-β-catenin antibodies. To examine the interaction of CKIε with rAxin and Dvl-1 using purified proteins in vitro, GST-Dvl-1 (full-length) or GST-rAxin-(298–832) (0.2 µm) was incubated with MBP-CKIε or MBP (20 pmol) immobilized on amylose resin in 100 µl of low salt buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After MBP fusion proteins were precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) once, LiCl buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5m LiCl) twice, and the low salt buffer once, then they were probed with the anti-GST antibody. His6-CKIε (100 ng of protein) was incubated with 0.5 µm MBP-rAxin, MBP-Dvl-1, GST-Dvl-1, GST-APC-(1211–2075), GST-β-catenin, or GST-GSK-3β in 30 µl of kinase reaction mixture (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 µm [γ-32P]ATP (500–2000 cpm/pmol)) for 30 min at 30 °C (55Cegielska A.

The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Where specified, the radioactivities of phosphorylated MBP-rAxin, MBP-Dvl-1, GST-APC-(1211–2075), and GST-β-catenin were counted. L cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were washed with PBS three times and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h. The cells were washed and incubated for 1 h with the anti-HA and anti-β-catenin antibodies. After being washed with PBS, they were further incubated for 1 h with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse IgG and Alexa 546-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The coverslips were washed with PBS, mounted on glass slides, and viewed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510, Carl-Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To observe Tcf-4 activity, the indicated amounts of pCGN/Dvl-1 and/or pCEP4/hCKIε were transfected into 293 cells (35-mm-diameter dish) with pTOPFLASH (0.5 µg), pEF-BOS-HA/hTcf-4E (0.1 µg), and pME18S/lacZ (0.5 µg) (16Kishida M.

At 46 h after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured using a PicaGene (Toyo B-NET Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and lumiphotometer TD4000 (Futaba Medical, Tokyo, Japan). To standardize the transfection efficiency, pME18S/lacZ carrying the SRα promotor linked to the coding sequence of the β-galactosidase gene was used as an internal control.

Sense mRNA was obtained by in vitrotranscription of linearized templates using the SP6-mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Fertilized eggs were de-jelled using 4.5%l-cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate, and mRNAs were injected into ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage. After injection, embryos were cultured for 3 days (stage 40–41). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard (58Bradford M.M. Anal.

However, because these experiments were done with overexpression assays in mammalian cells and a yeast two-hybrid system, we first examined whether CKIε associates with Dvl and Axin at endogenous level in intact cells. To this end, we generated the antibodies that immunoprecipitate Dvl and Axin. CKIε was detected slightly but reproducibly in the Dvl immune complex from L cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). In the Axin complex immunoprecipitated from L cells, CKIε was observed in addition to GSK-3β (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6). Because endogenous Dvl was not detected in this Axin complex (data not shown), it is likely that the complex formation of CKIε with Axin is not mediated via Dvl in the condition without Wnt stimulation. These results indicate that CKIε at least forms a complex with Dvl or Axin at endogenous level in intact cells.Figure 2Complex formation of CKIε with Dvl or Axin at endogenous level.

Virol. 1998; 72: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the latent genes, is the latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA), which was originally identified by an immunofluorescence assay with sera from Kaposi's sarcoma patients (5Gao S.J.

It is a 222–234-kDa nuclear protein consisting of 1,162 amino acids with three distinct domains (Fig. 1): (i) the proline-rich N-terminal domain; (ii) the acidic internal repeat region, which may account for its aberrantly slow electrophoretic migration and contains the putative leucine zipper domain; and (iii) the C-terminal domain, which may be responsible for the characteristically speckled immunofluorescence assay pattern of LANA (9Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LANA plays an important role in the persistence of the KSHV genome during the mitosis of host cells by tethering viral episome to host chromosomes (10Ballestas M.E. Chatis P.A. Kaye K.M.

It has been suggested that LANA may also act as a transcription factor (7Russo J.J. Bohenzky R.A. Chien M.C. Chen J. Yan M. Maddalena D. Parry J.P. Peruzzi D. Edelman I.S. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc.

Recent reports showed that LANA functions as a potent transcriptional repressor when it is tethered to constitutively active promoters via a heterologous DNA-binding domain (9Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, LANA has been shown to up- or down-regulate several synthetic, cellular, and viral promoters, including its own promoter, further confirming its transcriptional role (13Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 14Renne R. Barry C. Dittmer D. Compitello N. Brown P.O. Ganem D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LANA can form stable dimers, or possibly higher-order multimers via the C-terminal domain (9Schwam D.R. Luciano R.L. Mahajan S.S. Wong L. Wilson A.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8532-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the biological meaning of such dimers or multimer formations has not yet been discovered. Several cellular proteins have been shown to interact with LANA. These include histone H1 (11Cotter M.A. Robertson E.S. Virology. 1999; 264: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), RING3 (15Platt G.M. Simpson G.R. Mittnacht S. Schulz T.F. J.

Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) is a multifunctional transcriptional co-activator, which possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity (18Chrivia J.C.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). CBP and its structural/functional homologue, p300, interact with a number of cellular transcription factors, nuclear hormone receptors, and transcriptional co-activators, thereby, participating in cell growth, transformation, and development (for recent review, see Ref. 20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). Many viral proteins either utilize CBP as a co-activator or target it as an integrator of transcriptional regulation. These viral proteins include adenovirus E1A protein (21Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M.

Accumulated data suggested to us the possibility that there could be a functional association between KSHV LANA and CBP. In this study, we show that KSHV LANA interacts with CBP in vivo and in vitro, and also inhibits the transcriptional and enzymatic activity of CBP. pcDNA3 LANA and deletion mutants were described previously and constructed by similar procedures (17Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). pFlag-CMV2 LANA and deletion mutants were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNAs into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pFlag-CMV2 (Sigma). Internal deletion mutants of LANA were constructed by inserting cDNA encoding the N-terminal 213 amino acids of LANA into the EcoRI site of each N-terminal deletion mutants of LANA. Hemaggulutinin (HA)-tagged CBP expression vector was a gift from Dr. D. Trouche (Institut Gustave Roussy, France). Corresponding cDNA was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) to express and purify various CBP-deletion mutants fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) (31Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). pHKGal4-Fos, which expresses GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD)-fused c-Fos (33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. T. Kouzarides (University of Cambridge). For in vitro transcription/translation, polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA of c-Fos was inserted into theEcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA of CREB was a gift from Dr. M. R. Green (University of Massachusetts Medical School) and inserted into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pM (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to express GAL4 DBD-fused CREB. cDNA corresponding to the kinase-induced domain interacting (KIX) domain or the C/H3 region of CBP was inserted intoEcoRI/XhoI sites of pVP16 (CLONTECH). BglII/XbaI fragments of pVP16 and derivatives were inserted into theBamHI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to express VP16, VP16-KIX, and VP16-C/H3 driven by a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. pG4M2-luc was a gift from Dr. H. G. Stunnenberg (University of Nijmegen, the Netherlands). 293T cells were maintained and transfected as described previously (17Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sf9 and Hi-5 insect cells were maintained in a TNM-FH insect medium (Sigma) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Sf9 insect cells were transfected using CellFECTIN Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transient reporter assay was performed as described previously (17Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated mammalian expression vectors. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 500 µl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany), with brief sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. For co-immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was incubated with 20 µg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. 25 µl of pre-equilibrated, 50% slurry Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was then added, and it was further incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed three times in 1 ml of the same lysis buffer, then re-suspended in 20 µl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel loading buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by using 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies and detected by ECLTM (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In order to obtain an in vitro binding assay between full-length CBP and LANA, Sf9 insect cells were infected with high-titer recombinant baculovirus expressing His-tagged LANA or mock-infected, and then harvested after 48–72 h. The soluble extracts of the infected insect cells were mixed with soluble extracts of 293T cells transfected with an HA-tagged CBP expression vector or blank vector in the indicated combination. A binding assay was performed similarly as in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment, with the exception that a lysis/wash buffer containing 20 mm imidazole and pre-charged Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added after a 1-h incubation of two extracts. GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (17Lim C. Sohn H. Gwack Y. Choe J. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2645-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), except that a washing buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was used. For competitive GST pull-down assays, ∼17 pmol of bacterially expressed GST or GST-C/H3 fusion protein was preincubated with an increasing amount (25 or 50 pmol) of His-tagged LANA, LANA NΔIR, or LANA N at 4 °C for 3 h. After incubation with 5 µl of35S-labeled in vitro translated c-Fos at room temperature for 30 min, 20 µl of 75% slurry glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and further incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After washing four times with 1 ml of the same binding buffer, eluted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then subjected to autoradiography. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing N-terminal 6xHis-tagged LANA, LANA NΔIR, LANA N, and CBP were constructed using BAC-TO-BACTM Baculovirus Expression Systems (Life Technologies, Inc.). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pFastBac HTa LANA, LANA NΔIR, LANA N, and CBP were constructed and transformed into DH10Bac. Bacterial colonies containing recombinant bacmid were selected, then the isolated recombinant bacmid DNA was transfected into the Sf9 insect cells. After 48 to 72 h post-transfection, the supernatant of the culture media was used to check the expression level and amplification of the recombinant baculovirus. For protein purification, Hi-5 insect cells were infected with the corresponding recombinant baculovirus, and then harvested 72 h after infection. The cell pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then frozen at −70 °C. After thawing in a lysis buffer (25 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm imidazole and protease inhibitors), the resuspended cells were sonicated and cell debris removed by centrifugation. After 4 h incubation with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and then eluted with 1m imidazole. The eluted proteins were dialyzed, and then they were stored at −70 °C. The proteins were analyzed using a Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting with Penta-His Antibody (Qiagen). Approximately 1.5 pmol of His-tagged CBP or 2 pmol of bacterially purified GST-HAT was incubated with 1 µg of histone H3, H4 (Sigma), and 0.2 µl (50 µCi/ml) of [14C]acetyl-coenzyme A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 25-µl reaction buffer (50 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 30 °C for 30 min. His-tagged LANA was added and incubated in ice for 10 min (i) before substrate addition, (ii) during substrate addition, or (iii) after substrate addition. The reaction was stopped by adding a SDS sample buffer, and the products were separated by 15% acrylamide gel, and visualized and quantified by a Fujix BAS-1500 (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out to test whether or not there is a physical association between LANA and CBP. A Flag-tagged LANA expression vector was transiently co-transfected into 293T cells with an HA-tagged CBP expression vector. After immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody, the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Flag or anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, HA-tagged CBP was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody only in the presence of FLAG-tagged LANA. This indicates that LANA associates with CBP in mammalian cells. To further confirm the interaction between LANA and CBP, the recombinant baculovirus, which expresses N-terminal 6xHis tagged-LANA, was generated. Sf9 insect cell extracts infected with the recombinant baculovirus or mock-infected, were used in an in vitro binding assay. After incubation with extracts of 293T cells transfected with an HA-tagged CBP expression vector or a blank vector as in the indicated combinations (Fig. 2 B, top), the mixture was precipitated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose and immunoblotted as a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. As shown in Fig. 2 B, HA-tagged CBP was efficiently precipitated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose in the presence of His-tagged LANA, although it did show some nonspecific affinity for the resin in the absence of His-tagged LANA. Next, we examined the binding regions of LANA and CBP using GST pull-down assays. First, various deletion mutants of CBP that were fused to GST were constructed and purified (Fig. 3 A). These include the KIX domain and the C/H3 region which are both are known protein-protein interacting domains of CBP, the intrinsic HAT domain, and the N- and C-terminal transactivation domains. We expected that the mapping of the LANA-binding region of CBP could provide insight regarding the functional study. This is because viral proteins interacting with CBP can be categorized into two types according to the binding region (20Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro translated LANA interacted with the C/H3 region of CBP under our experimental conditions (Fig.3 B). This finding implied that LANA may regulate the co-activator function of CBP, rather than utilize CBP as a co-activator. The same result was obtained using purified His-tagged LANA instead of in vitro-translated LANA (data not shown). GST pull-down assays were performed to identify the binding domain of LANA to CBP reciprocally. Various deletion mutants of LANA used in GST pull-down assays are shown in Fig. 4. The N-terminal domain of LANA (amino acids 1–213) was required for nuclear localization (data not shown), and this domain was inserted in-frame into the EcoRI site of each N-terminal deletion mutant including LANA ΔDED, LANA ΔDED-C, LANA LZ-C, and LANA C. These NLS-containing mutants were designated as NLSΔDED, NLSΔDED-C, NLS LZ-C, and NLS C, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the C-terminal of LANA (amino acids 950–1162) alone was sufficient for binding to the C/H3 region of CBP. In addition, the aspartate/glutamate-rich repeat region (designated DED domain, amino acids 340–431) was also required for the binding in the case of LANA deletion mutants which lack the C-terminal region of LANA. Taken together, these data indicate that LANA interacts with the C/H3 region of CBP, and that two distinct domains of LANA are involved in that interaction. Since LANA interacts with the C/H3 region of CBP, we performed tests to determine whether or not this interaction would disrupt the interaction of the C/H3 region with other cellular factors like the adenovirus E1A (33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) or human papillomavirus E6 (27Patel D. Huang S.M. Baglia L.A. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we adopted a mammalian two-hybrid system using GAL4 DBD fused to c-Fos (Gal4 c-Fos) and VP16 activation domain-fused KIX (VP16-KIX) or the C/H3 region of CBP (VP16-C/H3). As shown in Fig.5 A, when these bait and prey plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells with the addition of the pFR-luc reporter plasmid that contains five GAL4-binding sites, a specific interaction between GAL4 c-Fos and VP16-C/H3 was observed, as described previously (27Patel D. Huang S.M. Baglia L.A. McCance D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5061-5072Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This interaction was disrupted by LANA in a dose-dependent manner. To exclude the possibility that the observed repression is due to the nonspecific effect of overexpressed LANA on transcriptional activity, the second mammalian system was adopted using GAL4 CREB as bait. As shown in Fig.5 B, LANA showed no effect on the interaction between CREB and the KIX domain of CBP, which confirmed that LANA specifically inhibits the interaction between c-Fos and the C/H3 region of CBP. To determine which region of LANA is involved in this inhibition, a series of LANA-deletion mutants were tested. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the DED domain, but not the C-terminal of LANA was required for this inhibition. Disruption of the in vivo interaction between c-Fos and the C/H3 region of CBP by LANA, was further confirmed by competitive GST pull-down assays (Fig. 5 D). The amount of GST-C/H3 used in these assays was experimentally adjusted so that it would be the limiting factor for the binding of both c-Fos and His-tagged LANA. The increasing amount of His-tagged LANA, LANA NΔIR, or LANA N was preincubated with GST-C/H3. This was done because LANA and c-Fos showed differential nonspecific affinity for GST moiety (data not shown). As described previously (33Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4758-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), in vitro translated c-Fos was precipitated by GST-C/H3. This interaction was inhibited by preincubated His-tagged LANA and His-tagged LANA NΔIR, but not by His-tagged LANA N, which does not contain both CBP-binding domains of LANA (Fig. 5 D). These results provide indirect evidence that LANA interacts with the C/H3 region of CBP, and suggest that LANA can compete with cellular factors for the C/H3 region of CBP. It was reported that CBP functions as a transcriptional activator when tethered to a promoter via a heterologous DNA-binding domain (18Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the transcriptional activation domain of CBP resides on both the N- and C-terminal domains of CBP using the GAL4 DBD-chimera system (34Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 35Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, CBP has intrinsic HAT activity, which stimulates transcription with promoter preference (36Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of LANA on its transcriptional activation of CBP, we used the GAL4-CBP chimera (31Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) with G4M2-luciferase reporter. This reporter plasmid has an adenovirus major late promoter downstream from the GAL4 DNA-binding sites, and its transcription can be stimulated by the HAT activity of CBP (36Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bannister A.J. Martin K. Haus-Seuffert P. Meisterernst M. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2886-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, the transcriptional activation of GAL4-CBP was inhibited by LANA in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibition was CBP specific since LANA showed no significant effect on the basal transcription of the reporter in the presence of GAL4-DBD alone. To determine the domain of LANA responsible for the repression, various LANA deletion mutants were tested (Fig. 6 B). The C-terminal deletion mutants of LANA showed the same inhibition pattern as in the case where LANA disrupts the interaction between c-Fos and the C/H3 region of CBP. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain of LANA was also necessary for the inhibition by LANA deletion mutants lacking the DED domain. However, the C-terminal domain alone was not sufficient for the inhibition of transcriptional activation by CBP. We speculated about the possible mechanisms by which LANA represses the transcriptional activation of CBP. LANA may compete with components of basal transcriptional machinery and/or other co-activators for the C/H3 region of CBP. However, the inhibition pattern of deletion mutants (Fig. 6 B) was somewhat different from that of mammalian two-hybrid system (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, we exclude the possibility that LANA may compete with other transcriptional co-activators for CBP. One possible mechanisms is that LANA inhibits the HAT activity of CBP. To prove this hypothesis, we carried out anin vitro HAT assay of CBP in the presence or absence of LANA. His-tagged CBP and LANA were purified using a baculovirus expression system, and then they were used in the HAT assay. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 by CBP was efficiently inhibited by LANA in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 2–5). When LANA was added 10 min after substrate addition (lane 7), only the slight reduction of histone acetylation was observed, confirming that LANA acts as an HAT inhibitor rather than a histone deacetylase. To further confirm the specific effect of LANA on the HAT activity of CBP, bacterially expressed and purified GST-HAT, instead of His-tagged CBP, was used in the HAT assay. As shown in Fig. 7 B, the HAT activity of GST-HAT, which does not contain the LANA-interacting C/H3 region of CBP, was negligibly affected by LANA. Similar results were obtained using the C terminus of LANA fused to a maltose-binding protein instead of His-tagged LANA (data not shown). These data suggest that LANA inhibits the in vitro HAT activity of CBP by direct binding to the C/H3 region of CBP. Previous study showed that KSHV LANA represses Epstein-Barr virus-latency promoters, Cp and Qp (13Krithivas A. Young D.B. Liao G. Greene D. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9637-9645Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activators of both promoters (EBNA-2 for Cp and cellular STATs for Qp), utilize common co-activators such as p300, CBP, and p/CAF for their transcription (24Wang L. Grossman S.R. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 29Jayachandra S. Low K.G. Thlick A.E., Yu, J. Ling P.D. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Virol. 2001; 75: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) recently reported that LANA modulates the transcriptional modulation of synthetic, cellular, and viral promoters, and specifically represses NF-κB-dependent transcription. Interestingly, NF-κB also uses CBP as a transcriptional co-activator (39Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). These data suggested the possibility of functional association between LANA and CBP. Based on this hypothesis, we characterize the interaction between LANA and CBP in this study. LANA physically associates with CBP in vivo and in vitro, and then the C/H3 region of CBP is targeted by LANA. Generally, viral proteins, which interact with CBP, can be categorized into two types according to the target region of CBP. Human T-lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax and human papillomavirus E2, which utilize CBP as a co-activator, bind to the KIX domain. This domain was originally identified as a phosphorylated CREB-binding region (26Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast, adenovirus E1A, SV40 T antigen, and human papillomavirus E6 bind to the C/H3 region and block CBP/p300 functions (21Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 22Lundblad J.R. Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Harter M.L. Goodman R.H.

Therefore, we assumed that LANA negatively regulates the co-activator function of CBP, and this was confirmed by the following functional studies. An in vitro binding assay revealed that two distinct domains of LANA are involved in the binding to the C/H3 region of CBP under our experimental conditions. These include an aspartate/glutamate-rich internal repeat region designated as the DED domain, and the C-terminal domain of LANA. The DED domain, but not the C terminus domain of LANA, could mediate the disruption of the interaction between the C/H3 region and a cellular factor, c-Fos. This may be explained by the way in which each CBP-binding domain of LANA individually binds to the distinct region within the C/H3 region, and only the DED domain-binding region of CBP overlaps with that of c-Fos to compete with each other. Alternatively, two CBP-binding domains of LANA could have differential affinities for the C/H3 region in vivo, but only the affinity of the DED domain may be comparable to that of c-Fos. As expected, LANA repressed the transcriptional activation of CBP in the GAL4-chimera system. We speculated about several mechanisms by which LANA represses transcriptional activation of GAL4-CBP. One possibility was that LANA inhibits the interactions between CBP and the basal transcriptional machinery and/or other co-activators. However, the C terminus of LANA mediates the negative regulation of CBP transactivation in several LANA-deletion mutants that lack the DED domain under this system. The inhibition pattern of LANA deletion mutants reveals that an additional inhibitory domain other than the CBP-binding domain of LANA is required for the repression. When compared with the result of a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we thought that the simple competition with other cellular factors for the C/H3 region could not explain the negative regulation of CBP by LANA. The result of an in vitro HAT assay suggests that the observed repression could be contributed, at least in part, by the inhibitory effect of LANA on the HAT activity of CBP. However, other possibilities cannot be excluded. For example, LANA may recruit the SAP30·mSin3A·CIR co-repressor complex to this artificial promoter via its N terminus to exert the negative effect, or different domains of LANA may be required for the competition with each cellular factor. KSHV ORF50, a homolog of the Epstein-Barr virus immediate early gene product Rta, has been known to activate the lytic cycle of KSHV (40Lukac D.M. Renne R. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. Virology. 1998; 252: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 41Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Sun R. Lin S.F. Gradoville L. Yuan Y. Zhu F. Miller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10866-10871Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Recently, we also found that ORF50 utilizes CBP as its transcriptional co-activator. This suggests that the balance between HATs and histone deacetylases in KSHV-infected cells would be important for ORF50 as a molecular switch from the latent to the lytic cycle of KSHV (31Gwack Y. Byun H. Hwang S. Lim C. Choe J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is likely that LANA actively participates in switching from the latent to the lytic cycle by interacting with CBP. In addition, both p53 and ATF4/CREB2, of which transcriptional activation was previously shown to be inhibited by direct binding to LANA (16Friborg J. Kong W. Hottiger M.O. Nabel G.J.

Therefore, it is possible that the observed repression by LANA may, at least in part, be contributed to the sequestration of CBP by LANA. These promoter- and factor-specific effects of LANA and the possible involvement of CBP sequestration by LANA are under investigation. We thank Drs. Dong Wook Kim and Heedai Kim for technical assistance in constructing recombinant baculovirus expression system."

https://openalex.org/W1912307511,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) produced by macrophages in the arterial wall protects against atherosclerosis, but the regulation of its secretion by these cells is poorly understood. Here we investigated the contribution of the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABC8 to the secretion of apoE from either primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) or human THP1 macrophages. During incubations of up to 6 h, apoE secretion from both THP1 macrophages and HMDM was stimulated by 8-Br-cAMP, which activates ABCA1 expression. The putative ABCA1 inhibitor glyburide and antisense oligonucleotides directed against ABCA1 mRNA significantly reduced apoE secretion from THP1 macrophages and HMDM. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against ABC8 mRNA also inhibited apoE secretion, although this inhibition was less pronounced and consistent than in the case of ABCA1. ApoE secretion from HMDM of ABCA1-deficient patients with Tangier disease was also decreased. ApoE mRNA expression was not affected by inhibition of ABCA1 or ABC8 in normal HMDM or the lack of functional ABCA1 in HMDM from Tangier disease patients. Inhibition of ABCA1 in HMDM prevented the occurrence of anti-apoE-immunoreactive granular structures in the plasma membrane. We conclude that ABCA1 and, to a lesser extent, ABC8 both promote secretion of apoE from human macrophages."

Gas6 is the ligand of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase; upon binding to its receptor Gas6 activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) and its downstream targets S6K and Akt. Gas6 anti-apoptotic signaling was previously shown to require functional PI3K and Akt and to involve Bad phosphorylation in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells. Here we demonstrate that Gas6 induces a rapid and transient increase in nuclear NF-κB binding activity coupled to transcription activation from NF-κB-responsive promoters and increase in Bcl-xL protein level. Gas6 survival function is impaired in cells lacking p65/RelA and in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with a dominant negative IκB, indicating that NF-κB activation plays a central role in promoting survival in this system. Moreover, NF-κB activation can be blocked by a dominant negative Akt and by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, thus suggesting that NF-κB activation is a downstream event with respect to PI3K and Akt, as already described for other growth factors. In addition, we show that glycogen synthase kinase 3, which is phosphorylated in response to Gas6, can physically associate with NFKB1/p105 in living cells and can phosphorylate it in vitro. Furthermore, Gas6 treatment is coupled to a decrease in p105 protein level.

Inactivation of the Gas6 gene has recently been shown to prevent venous and arterial thrombosis in mice and protect against fatal collagen/epinephrine-induced thrombo-embolism (1Angelillo-Scherrer A. deFrutos P.G.

This knock-out phenotype has unveiled one of the biological functions of Gas6; however, published data of the past several years argue for a multiplicity of functions of GAS6/Axl signaling in normal and cancer cells.

Moreover, Mer-dependent protection from apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 withdrawal in hematopoietic cells involves PI3K induction and NF-κB transcriptional activation (19Georgescu M.M. Kirsch K.H. Shishido T. Zong C. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether these pieces of evidences suggest that NF-κB could play a role in Gas6/Axl signaling. NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm of the majority of cell types as homodimer or heterodimer of a family of structurally related proteins (20Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Five members have been identified in mammalian cells: RelA (p65), cRel, RelB, NF-κB1 (p50/p105), and NF-κB2 (p52/p100). They are present in an inactive form associated with inhibitory proteins that mask their nuclear localization signal. Inhibitors belong either to the IκB family (IκBα, β, ε, and Bcl3) or are the precursors of NF-κB1 and NF-κB2: p105 and p100, respectively. A wide variety of stimuli are known to activate NF-κB, including cytokines, growth factors, bacterial and viral products, oxidative stress, UV irradiation, and some pharmaceutical drugs and chemicals. Upon cell stimulation IκB is rapidly phosphorylated at two conserved serine residues near its amino terminus (21Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Current Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Similarly, p105 is phosphorylated in its carboxyl-terminal region (22Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the inhibitors triggers their proteolytic degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The released NF-κB dimer can then translocate to the nucleus, where it directly binds to its cognate DNA sequence to activate gene transcription. NF-κB is a regulator of inflammation and immune response as well as of cellular proliferation and apoptosis (23Foo S.Y. Nolan P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Although NF-κB has been shown to be pro-apoptotic in certain experimental settings, a number of data argues for a role of NF-κB as regulator of survival.RelA (p65) knock-out in mice is embryonically lethal as a result of extensive liver apoptosis. In addition, cells derived from these mice show enhanced sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis (24Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D.

Besides NF-κB induction, activation of Akt/PKB has been reported to determine partial inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) in response to insulin (33Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). bcl-x promoter and bcl-xpromoter triple mutant linked to luciferase expression vector were a kind gift of Dr. Perez Polo and are described in a previous study (29Glasgow J.N. Wood T. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). PRL-null Renilla luciferase expression vector was from Promega (Madison, WI). Briefly, 1–2 µg of plasmid DNA were diluted in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and mixed with LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent. Complexes were allowed to form for 15 min prior to addition to the cells. Meanwhile the culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM. The medium was replaced with 0.5% FCS containing medium 5 h after transfection to induce growth arrest. 48 h later the medium was replaced with serum-free medium with or without Gas6, and the cells were lysed 5 h later in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Extracts were collected and cleared by centrifugation at high speed. The substrates were obtained using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega), and relative light units (firefly/Renilla) were measured using a luminometer (Turner Design). Western blot analysis was performed by preparing whole cell extracts in 2× SDS sample buffer containing 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin on ice. 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate was added to the extracts to be analyzed with anti-phospho-GSK3 antibodies. Western blotting antibodies were purchased from the following companies: IκB (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA), NF-κB p50/105 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Bcl-x (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), GSK3 (BIOSOURCE International Inc.), Phospho GSK3 (Cell Signaling), and actin (Sigma). After incubation with primary antibodies, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies (Sigma) and visualized using ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Nuclear extracts and oligonucleotide probe were prepared as described previously (39Demarchi F. Dadda F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5 µg of nuclear extracts was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech UK)-labeled NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide and analyzed in native 5% gel as described (39Demarchi F. Dadda F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Super-shift assays were performed by preincubating nuclear extracts with specific antibodies for 15 min. NF-κB p50, p65, and cRel antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. 293 cells grown on 10-cm plates were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin,1 µg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate on ice. Cells were disrupted by repeated aspiration through a 26-gauge needle, and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation. The lysates were incubated with 4 µg of p50/105 antibody or GSK3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and incubated for 2 h. At this point the IP products to be used for kinase assay were centrifuged and washed twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 µmATP, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate) and resuspended in the same buffer. Kinase assay was performed by adding to the immunoprecipitation product: 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 µl of recombinant GSK3β (Cell Signaling) and incubating 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE after boiling for 2 min. The IP reactions to be analyzed by SDS-PAGE were centrifuged and washed three times with lysis buffer. Afterward, the beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer, boiled, and separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gas6 anti-apoptotic activity was previously shown to absolutely require the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) (14Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1997; 17: 4442-4453Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and its substrate AKT/PKB (15Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Varnum B. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4224-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in serum-starved NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. AKT has been shown to drive transcription activation of NF-κB both indirectly through IKK and subsequent IκB phosphorylation (16Romanshova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar, 17Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeiffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar) or directly by p65/RelA subunit phosphorylation (42Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). As a first approach to verify whether Gas6 could lead to NF-κB induction we analyzed the effect of Gas6 treatment on the protein level of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB-α. NIH 3T3 were grown for 48 h in 0.5% containing medium to achieve quiescence. Thereafter the medium was replaced with serum-free containing medium in the presence or absence of Gas6 and lysates prepared at different time points (5, 15, 30, 60 min). Some plates were replaced with 20% FCS containing medium as control for IκBα down-regulation. The blot shown in Fig.1A demonstrates that both Gas6 and 20% FCS treatment are coupled to a transient and rapid decrease in IκBα. Actin was used as loading control. To analyze the effect of Gas6 on nuclear NF-κB binding activity, gel retardation assays were performed with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing a NF-κB consensus as already described (39Demarchi F. Dadda F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved (48 h in 0.5% FCS) and then shifted to 20% FCS or to serum-free medium with or without Gas6, and nuclear extracts were prepared 60 min later. Extracts were prepared also from cells left in 0.5% FCS as negative control. Fig.1 B shows the retarded bands. Shifting the cells to serum-free induces a slight increase in binding activity (lane 2) as compared with growth-arrested control cells (lane 1). Gas6 (lane 4) induces a clear increase in the complex binding to the κB-specific oligonucleotide, just as 20% serum (lane 3), used as positive control, because it was previously shown to induce NF-κB (40Baldwin Jr., A.S. Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Beg A.A. Coodly L.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4943-4951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the retarded complex was assessed by competition experiments with cold specific and unspecific oligonucleotides as already described (39Demarchi F. Dadda F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because we have observed that Gas6 treatment is coupled to the induction of nuclear NF-κB binding activity, we investigated the effect of other growth factors in our experimental setting. Serum-starved cells were shifted to serum-free medium, and FGF, EGF, or Gas6 were added to the cells. Control cells were shifted to serum-free medium without growth factors. Treated cells were either used to prepare nuclear extracts 30 min later, or to measure viability 20 h later. The graph reported in Fig.2A indicates the increase in cell viability with respect to the control cells grown in serum-free containing medium. Both Gas6 and FGF, but not EGF, efficiently protect serum-starved NIH 3T3 fibroblasts from apoptosis, as already reported (8Goruppi S. Ruaro E. Schneider C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 471-480PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, protection from apoptosis correlates with a clear increase of NF-κB binding activity, as shown in Fig.2 B. The κB binding activity induced by FGF and Gas6 are comparable, whereas it is significantly lower in extracts from EGF-treated cells. To test the importance of NF-κB induction in Gas6-mediated protection from apoptosis, we challenged growth-arrested mouse fibroblasts lacking either p50 (41Sha W.C. Liou H.C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) or p65 (24Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar) subunits of NF-κB with serum-free medium in the presence or absence Gas6. As reported in the graph of Fig.2 C, p50−/− cells can be rescued by Gas6, as for wild type NIH 3T3 cells, whereas p65−/− cells cannot. This result demonstrates that Gas6-mediated protection from apoptosis induced upon serum withdrawal requires a functional cRel/p65, whereas p50 is dispensable. To further investigate the relevance of NF-κB induction for Gas6 survival properties, we analyzed the effect of a dominant negative IκBα (IκBΔN), which cannot be phosphorylated and is therefore resistant to degradation. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with an expression vector for IκBΔN or with an empty vector as control using LipofectAMINE. Six hours after transfection the cells were shifted to a medium containing 0.5% serum to induce growth arrest. After 48 h the cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in serum-free plus or minus Gas6 or again with 0.5% serum containing medium for additional 20 h. At this point the cells were trypsinized and counted. The graph of Fig. 2 D reports the average of the results obtained in three independent experiments and clearly demonstrates that blocking NF-κB activation by a dominant negative IκB impairs Gas6 survival activity. To analyze the kinetics of NF-κB binding activity induction, we prepared nuclear extracts at different time points after shifting serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells to serum-free medium containing Gas6 as indicated in Fig.3. The extracts were used in a gel retardation assay with a probe specific for NF-κB. The results of this time course experiment, shown in Fig. 3 A, indicate that the induction starts already at 15 min, peaks at 30 min, and subsequently declines. To identify the polypeptides present in the shifted complex we preincubated the nuclear extracts either with p50-, p65-, or cRel-specific antibodies before performing the gel retardation assay. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both p50 and p65 antibodies can partially super-shift the retarded complex, whereas cRel-specific antibody cannot. These data indicate that Gas6-induced complex contains both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB but not cRel. The effect of Gas6 on NF-κB-dependent transcription was studied by analyzing its effect both on an artificial promoter containing two NF-κB binding sites and on the bcl-x promoter. This promoter has recently been shown to contain three NF-κB binding sites and to be responsive to NF-κB induction (29Glasgow J.N. Wood T. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,28Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 31Zong W.X. Edelstein L.C. Chen C. Bash J. Gelinas C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with luciferase expression plasmids driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase(TK) promoter or the same promoter containing two NF-κB binding sites (38Mantovani F. Covaceuszach S. Rustighi A. Sgarra R. Heath C. Goodwin G.H. Manfioletti G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A Renilla expression vector was included in each transfection experiment for normalization. 6 h after transfection the cells were rinsed and the medium was replaced with 0.5% FCS containing medium to induce growth arrest. 48 h later the medium was changed with serum-free medium with or without Gas6 for an additional 5 h. Afterward, relative luciferase activity (firefly/Renilla) was measured with a luminometer. Fig. 4A shows the increase of relative luciferase (LUC) activity occurring for each transfected expression vector using extracts from Gas6-treated cells as compared with control cells. These results indicate that Gas6 can specifically increase the transcription rate from a promoter containing binding sites for NF-κB. Similar results were obtained by transfecting a LUC expression vector driven by the bcl-x promoter or abcl-x promoter in which the three putative NF-κB binding sites have been mutated (29Glasgow J.N. Wood T. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 B, Gas6 can positively affect the bcl-x promoter but not the same promoter lacking NF-κB binding sites. Altogether these data argue that Gas6 can activate NF-κB-dependent transcription. To verify the biological relevance of the increase in bcl-x promoter activity in response to Gas6, we analyzed its effect on Bcl- xL protein level in a time-course experiment. Cell lysates from serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells incubated for different times with Gas6 were analyzed in a Western blot decorated with an antibody specific for Bcl- xL; actin was used as loading control. As shown in Fig. 4 C, Gas6 treatment is coupled to an increase in Bcl- xL protein level, suggesting that one of the mechanisms by which Gas6 can protect from apoptosis is by up-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x. To further assess the relevance of NF-κB activation by Gas6 in Bcl-x up-regulation, the same type of analysis was performed in serum-starved p65−/− and p50−/− cells. Fig. 5A shows that bcl-xL promoter activity appears to be susceptible to Gas6 induction in p50−/− cells, whereas it is unaffected in p65−/− cells. The blot of Fig. 5 B shows that Gas6 induces Bcl-xL protein increase in p50−/− cells, but not in p65−/− cells, suggesting that a functional p65 is required for the noticed effect of Gas6. Previous studies have demonstrated the absolute requiremen"

Nerve growth factor is the cognate ligand for TrkA, brain-derived neurotrophic factor for TrkB, and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) for TrkC. NT-3 also binds TrkA and TrkB as a heterologous ligand. All neurotrophins bind p75, which regulates ligand affinity and Trk signals. Trk extracellular domain has five subdomains: a leucine-rich motif, two cysteine-rich clusters, and immunoglobulin-like subdomains IgG-C1 and IgG-C2. The IgG-C1 subdomain is surface exposed in the tertiary structure and regulates ligand-independent activation. The IgG-C2 subdomain is less exposed but regulates cognate ligand binding and Trk activation. NT-3 as a heterologous ligand of TrkA and TrkB optimally requires the IgG-C2 but also binds other subdomains of these receptors. When p75 is co-expressed, major changes are observed; NGF-TrkA activation can occur also via the cysteine 1 subdomain, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor-TrkB activation requires the TrkB leucine-rich motif and cysteine 2 subdomains. We propose a two-site model of Trk binding and activation, regulated conformationally by the IgG-C1 subdomain.

Lowenstein D.H. Reichardt L.F. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NTFs include nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). NGF interacts selectively with TrkA receptors, and BDNF interacts selectively with TrkB receptors. NT-3 interacts with TrkC receptors preferably, but it is more promiscuous and can also bind TrkA and TrkB (2Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). All NTFs also bind a shared receptor termed p75 with relative low affinity. NTFs bind to the extracellular domain of Trk and induce receptor homodimerization, leading to activation of the intrinsic intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic activity (3Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 4Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1404-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of Trk receptors features five subdomains defined by their homology to other proteins (5Schneider R. Schweiger M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar). Near the N terminus, there is a leucine-rich motif (LRM), flanked by two cysteine-rich clusters (Cys-1 and Cys-2). Closer to the transmembrane spanning region, there are two immunoglobulin-like subdomains termed IgG-C1 and IgG-C2 (Fig. 1). Previous work addressed the Trk extracellular domains responsible for NTF binding. Expression of truncated or chimeric receptors in cells showed that IgG-C2 subdomains of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC are relevant for binding NGF, BDNF, and NT-3, respectively (6Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D. Parada L. Presta L.

Asopa V. Robertson A.G.S. Clarke A.R. Tyler S. Bennett G.S. Brian S.D. Wilcock G.K. Allen S.J. Smith S.K.F. Dawbarn D. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The LRM subdomain was also proposed as ligand binding (11Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Lang M.E. Auer B. Schneider R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11256-11263Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Windisch J.M. Marksteiner R. Schneider R. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 50: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); however, expression of LRM-deleted TrkA did not affect NGF binding or activity but altered NT-3 activity (8MacDonald J.I.S. Meakin S.O. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our study had three aims. The first was to clarify the general architecture of Trk and to define possible “hinge” or regulatory regions that may control receptor activation. While tyrosine kinases undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding (14Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar), analyses failed to demonstrate these changes in Trk (15Woo S. Whalen C. Neet K. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or in NGF-IgGC2 crystals (16Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. Vos A.M.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Second, we wanted to address the hypothesis that p75 co-expression may allow certain ligands to activate Trks via different extracellular subdomains. This would be expected because there are reports of p75-Trk allosteric or cooperative interactions (17Bamji S.X. Majdan M. Pozniak C.D. Belliveau D.J. Aloyz R. Kohn J. Causing C.G. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 911-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Brennan C. Rivas-Plata K. Landis S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 19Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 20MacPhee I.J. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23547-23551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kohn J. Aloyz R. Toma J. Haak-Frendscho M. Miller F. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5393-5408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third aim was to define subdomains of TrkA and TrkB that are functional toward heterologous ligands. While other studies addressed Trk interactions with cognate ligands, studies of heterologous receptor activation by NT-3 were not done. We find that most of the TrkA or TrkB activation by cognate ligands occurs via the IgG-C2 subdomain. NT-3-mediated activation of TrkA or TrkB is also mediated by the IgG-C2 subdomain but requires additional subdomain(s), probably the IgG-C1. Expression of p75 allows NGF activation of TrkA via its Cys-1-rich subdomain, while BDNF activation of TrkB also involves the LRM and cysteine 2 subdomains when p75 is expressed. The IgG-C1 subdomain is highly exposed in the tertiary structure and seems to control ligand-independent activation. We propose that the IgG-C1 subdomain is a hinge region with intrinsic regulation of receptor conformation and activation. Our data point to a complex, multistage process of regulating receptor-ligand interactions that include intrinsic Trk-regulatory subdomains and receptor-co-receptor interactions. Single subdomains (leucine repeats; IgG-C1 and IgG-C2) of human TrkA were generated by polymerase chain reaction using as template a 2.7-kb cDNA encoding the humantrkA in Bluescript KS+ vector. Oligonucleotide primers used for the polymerase chain reaction amplification of the human TrkA extracellular subdomains: Cys cluster forward, 5′-ATATGAATTC GCG CAC ATG TCG GGG GAG-3′; Cys cluster backward, 5′-ATAT TTCGAA ATC ACG GAG CTC CAG ATG-3′; LRM forward, 5′-ATAT TTCGAA GGC CTG GGG GAG CTG AGA-3′; LRM backward, 5′-ATAT GCATGC GGT ATT GGG CAT GTG GGC-3′; IgG-C1 forward, 5′-ATAT GCATGC GGT GTG CCC ACG CTG AAG-3′; IgG-C1 backward, 5′-ATAT CTCGAG CTG CAC ACT GGC CGG GAA-3′; IgG-C2 forward, 5′-ATAT CTCGAG ACG GCG GTG GAG ATG CAC-3′; IgG-C2 backward, 5′-ATAT ACGCGT TGT ACT GTT AGT GTC AGG-3′. They include unique restriction sites (boldface type) to allow exchange with the corresponding rat TrkB subdomains. The chimeric receptors were constructed by subcloning each human TrkA subdomain into the corresponding unique restriction sites of the rat trkB cDNA reported in previous work (6Perez P. Coll P.M. Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). All the chimeric constructs were confirmed by sequencing and were cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector that contains a selection gene providing resistance to neomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK293 cells (human kidney epithelium, Trk−, p75−) and nnr5 cells (derived from PC12 cells, Trk−, p75++) were transfected with the chimeric cDNA constructs using the LipofectAMINE Plus method (Life Technologies, Inc.). At least three independent subclones of neomycin-resistant cells for each chimera were obtained by limiting dilution techniques. Quantitative Western blot analysis (23Mufson E.J. Lavine N. Jaffar S. Kordower J.H. Quirion R. Saragovi H.U. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with a polyclonal antibody directed to the Trk intracellular domain (203 antisera; a gift of David Kaplan, McGill University) indicated that the stable HEK293 subclones express 40,000–100,000 chimeric receptors/cell and that the stable nnr5 subclones express 2,000–6,000 chimeric receptors/cell (data not shown). All cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, and glutamine. Transfectants had 0.4 mg/ml neomycin. Adenoviruses expressing full-length rat p75 were a kind gift of Sung Ok Yoon (Ohio State University). Expression of p75 in HEK293 cells was achieved by infection at a multiplicity of infection of 10. This resulted in undetectable cell death after 16 h at the time when cells were used for phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) assays. At 16 h postinfection, >90% of the HEK293 cells had homogeneous expression of p75. Quantitative FACScan assays and Western blotting (24Saragovi H.U. Zheng W.H. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol.

Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At longer times postinfection (30 h and above) there was progressive cell death due to viral replication, which precluded us from performing long term cell survival assays. Cells used for survival assays were wild type or transfected HEK293 and nnr5. Cell survival was measured by quantitative tetrazolium salt reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) and OD readings as described (21Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U.

Cells were plated in serum-free media (SFM) (PFHM-II, Life Technologies, Inc.), with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), supplemented with SFM (negative control), with 2 nm of the indicated neurotrophin (NTF) (test), or with 5% serum (positive control) for ∼68 h. Cell growth/survival was calculated relative to 5% serum (standardized to 100%) to eliminate the possible confounding factor of different growth rates by each clone, as described (21Maliartchouk S.

The difference between 5% serum and SFM supplemented with neurotrophin is that in the former cells survive and grow but in the latter there is poor growth. All assays were repeated with at least three subclones for each construct, and each assay was repeated at least three times (n = 4–6 per assay). Statistical analysis was done by paired student t test with Bonferroni corrections, and significance was p < 0.02. Western blots were performed as described (21Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Saragovi H.U. Zheng W.H. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B. Cuello A.C. Debeir T. Neet K.E. J. Biol.

For anti-Trk immunoblotting, cells were solubilized, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with RTA serum (25Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) directed to the whole extracellular domain of TrkA. Equal protein loading was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of gels and by stripping and reblotting membranes with anti-Trk 203 antiserum. Cells were washed and rested in SFM at 37 °C for 30 min. After ligand treatment (2 nm neurotrophin at 37 °C for 12 min), cells were solubilized, and protein concentrations were determined. Samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-Tyr(P)) antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Equal loading was confirmed by stripping and reblotting membranes with anti-Trk 203 antiserum. Analysis of 125I-NGF binding to chimeric or wild type receptor-expressing cells was done as described (24Saragovi H.U. Zheng W.H. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R. Kamen A. Woo S.B.

Cells (1 × 106/point) were added to serial dilutions of 125I-NGF (70 µCi/µg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of a 250-fold excess of cold NGF as competitor. Free and cell-bound counts were fractionated, counted (COBRA γ counter), and analyzed by Scatchard plot. Full-length TrkB receptors expressing subdomains of human TrkA were generated as illustrated in Fig. 1, using the primers described under “Materials and Methods.” The five chimeric cDNAs and wild type receptor controls were transfected into HEK293 or nnr5 cells, and at least three stable independent clones were obtained for each construct. All biological data were reproduced with three independent subclones for each cDNA construct in each cell line. Trophic signals via Trk chimeras expressed in HEK293 cells were probed in survival assays using the quantitative 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method (Table I). Cells cultured in SFM undergo apoptotic death, which can be rescued by NTFs if the cells express functional NTF receptors.Table ILigand-mediated survival of HEK293 cells expressing Trk receptorsStable HEK 293 subclonesSFM + 2 nm NTFNGFNT-3BDNF%%%1.

Trophic survival was calculated relative to controls (5% serum = 100%; SFM = 0%). Shown is percentage survival (mean ± S.D.) averaged from three experiments, each experimentn = 6. Control HEK293 cells transfected with wild type Trks exhibited the expected survival profile (Table I, rows 7–9), where NGF protected TrkA-expressing cells, BDNF protected TrkB-expressing cells, and NT-3 protected TrkC-expressing and TrkB-expressing cells and significantly protected TrkA-expressing cells but to a lower degree. Untransfected HEK293 cells did not survive in SFM supplemented with NTFs (Table I, row 1). HEK293 cells expressing the 1.1 chimera did not survive with NGF but did survive with NT-3 and with BDNF (Table I, row 2). Similar data was obtained with the 2.1 chimera, except that more limited survival was seen with NT-3 (Table I, row 3). Hence, the Cys-1, LRM, and Cys-2 subdomains from TrkA or TrkB do not play a role in NGF-TrkA activation (no gain of function), nor do they play a major role in BDNF-TrkB activation (no major loss of function); but perhaps they do for NT-3-TrkB activation. Cells expressing the 2.2 chimera had low but significant survival with NGF, NT-3, and BDNF (Table I, row 4). The lower survival induced by NT-3 and BDNF in the 2.2 chimera (compared with the 2.1 chimera) is probably due to the replacement of the IgG-C1 subdomain with that of TrkA (the only difference between the 2.2 and the 2.1 chimeras). These data suggest an activating role for the IgG-C1 subdomain of TrkB bound by NT-3 or BDNF and also suggest an activating role for the IgG-C1 subdomain of TrkA bound by NGF. HEK293 cells expressing the 3.1 chimera are constitutively activated, and cells have significant survival in SFM (∼40% compared with serum) in the absence of NTFs. Survival was not enhanced significantly in response to any NTF. These data also point to a critical role of the IgG-C1 subdomain of TrkB and suggest that this subdomain is functionally different in TrkA. HEK293 cells expressing the 4.1 chimera had significant survival with NGF, significant but low survival with NT-3, and no survival with BDNF (Table I, row 6). Compared with wild type TrkA, NGF activates in full via the TrkA IgG-C2 subdomain, and BDNF activation absolutely requires the TrkB IgG-C2 subdomain. NT-3 may activate partially via TrkA IgG-C2 (or the remaining subdomains of TrkB) in the 4.1 chimera, but it seems to be more dependent on other subdomains. In order to test whether there are chimeras that did not signal but bound NGF, we performed125I-NGF binding studies (Fig.2). We tested NGF binding with the 1.1, 3.1, and 4.1 chimeras and binding to wild type HEK293 cells as control. Only the 4.1 chimera had specific 125I-NGF binding. The 4.1 chimera subclone 6 (4.1.6) expresses ∼50,000 NGF receptors/cell with an apparent single affinity of 80 ± 24 pm(n = 3 independent assays). These binding sites were fully competed by a 250-fold excess of unlabeled NGF (Fig. 2). The 1.1 chimera, the 3.1 chimera, and the wild type HEK293 cells showed no specific NGF binding sites (n = 2 independent assays) (data not shown). The binding assays would not have detected binding affinities significantly lower than 10 nm (which is approximately the K d of p75). Therefore, we cannot rule out very low affinity NGF binding sites in 1.1 and 3.1 chimeras. Likewise, 125I-NGF binding assays using cells co-expressing chimeras and p75 are fruitless, because it is impossible to discriminate whether the chimera (as well as p75) binds NGF with low affinity. Direct binding studies of 125I-NT-3 and125I-BDNF to 4.1.6 cells could not be carried out, because these ligands were unavailable to us in radiolabeled form. Trk Tyr(P) was assayed in HEK293 transfectants after 12 min of exposure to NTFs (Fig. 3,A–E). The 1.1 and 2.1 chimeras respond well to NT-3 and BDNF but not to NGF (Fig. 3, A and B); the 2.2 chimeras respond to NGF, NT-3, and BDNF but very poorly, and the gel had to be overexposed to see the response (Fig. 3 C). The 3.1 chimeras are constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig.3 D, untreated), and there is no significant increase in response to all ligands (Fig. 3 D). The 4.1 chimeras respond very well to NGF and poorly to NT-3, and they do not respond to BDNF (Fig. 3 E). Gain of NGF function and loss of BDNF function defines the IgG-C2 as the main activation subdomain, with smaller contributions from other subdomains. Interpretation for NT-3 survival is less clear, because this growth factor binds both wild type TrkA and TrkB, and we cannot discriminate which receptor is bound by NT-3 in our chimeras. To assess how co-expression of p75 receptors may affect the activation of Trk chimeras, HEK293 transfectants were infected with adenoviral constructs expressing full-length p75. After 16 h, there was homogeneous expression of p75 receptors in >90% of the cells, with no death (data not shown). At 16 h postinfection, the Tyr(P) of the chimeric receptors was measured (Fig. 3,F–J). In the presence of p75 the 1.1 chimera is activated by NGF, NT-3, and BDNF (Fig. 3 F). The major difference is that in the absence of p75 NGF does not activate the 1.1 chimera (Fig. 3 A). In the presence of p75, the 2.1 chimera is activated well by NT-3 and poorly by BDNF and NGF (Fig. 3 G). The major difference is that in the absence of p75 (Fig. 3 B) BDNF can activate the 2.1 chimera better. In the presence of p75, the 2.2 chimera does not respond to any NTF (Fig. 3 H). There are no major differences with data in the absence of p75 (Fig. 3 C). In both cases, the gels had to be overexposed to see any limited response to ligand. In the presence of p75, the 3.1 chimera is still constitutively activated (Fig. 3 I, Untre.) but to a lower degree than when p75 is absent (Fig. 3 D, Untre.). In the presence of p75, the 4.1 chimeras respond well to NGF and NT-3 and do not respond to BDNF (Fig. 3 J). The major difference is that NT-3 activation (relative to NGF) is higher in the presence of p75 than in the absence of p75 (Fig. 3 E). In all chimeras, ligand-independent Tyr(P) of the receptors (even the constitutively activated 3.1 chimera) was substantially lower after expression of p75 (see untreated (Untre.) lanes for allpanels). These data suggest that unbound p75 can inhibit constitutive Trk activation and that p75 can alter the ligand-dependent activation subdomains of Trk receptors. Long term (2–3-day) survival assays could not be done with HEK293 cells expressing p75, because these cells die ∼36 h after adenoviral infection. Thus, all of the chimeric cDNAs were transfected and expressed in nnr5 cells to test whether p75 affects the long term survival function of Trk chimeras. Stable nnr5 clones were obtained for all cDNAs except the 3.1 chimera, where cells seem to differentiate in the absence of ligand. The nnr5 long term survival data (TableII) are consistent with the Tyr(P) results for HEK293 transfectants co-expressing p75 (Fig. 3). As expected, all stably transfected nnr5 clones cultured in SFM undergo apoptotic death. Positive controls transfected with wild type Trk receptors exhibited the expected survival profile (Table II, rows 6 and 7). Untransfected nnr5 cells cultured in SFM die whether or not they are supplemented with NTFs (Table II, row 1), indicating that p75 expression alone does not mediate survival or death signals in these cells.Table IILigand-mediated survival of nnr5 cells expressing Trk receptorsStable nnr5 subclones2-aStable 3.1 chimera-expressing clones were not obtained; transfectants seem to differentiate and stop growing.SFM + 2 nm NTFNGFNT-3BDNF1.

The nnr5 cells expressing the 1.1 chimera (Table II, row 2) survived in response to NGF, while NT-3- and BDNF-induced survival was statistically insignificant. The nnr5 cells expressing the 2.1 chimera (Table II, row 3) survived with NT-3, whereas survival in response to BDNF and NGF was statistically insignificant. The nnr5 cells expressing the 2.2 chimera (Table II, row 4) did not respond efficiently to any neurotrophin, and all responses were low compared with wild type TrkB and TrkA. The nnr5 cells expressing the 4.1 chimera (Table II, row 5) survived with NGF and with NT-3, but survival in response to BDNF was insignificant. These nnr5 survival data are generally consistent with the Tyr(P) results for HEK293 transfectants co-expressing p75 (Fig. 3). However, it is noteworthy that early (12 min) and late (2–3 days) read-outs are not necessarily linear and kinetics may vary (24Saragovi H.U. Zheng W.H. Maliartchouk S. DiGugliemo G.M. Mawal Y.R.

Complementary Tyr(P) studies could not be easily carried out in the nnr5 transfectants, because they express very low levels of chimeric receptors. The main differences between survival of nnr5 transfectants (p75+) and HEK293 transfectants (p75−) are that (i) NGF gained, while NT-3 and BDNF significantly decreased function in the nnr5 1.1 chimera; (ii) BDNF significantly decreased function in the nnr5 2.1 chimera; (iii) all ligands significantly decreased function in the nnr5 2.2 chimera; and (iv) NGF (but not NT-3) decreased function in the nnr5 4.1 chimera (TableIII).Table IIISummary of survival and Tyr(P) dataTrk A/B Constructsp75 co-expressionLigand-induced activation of chimeric receptors3-aHigh > medium > low > nil.

Open table in a new tab Relative ligand-dependent activation of TrkA/B chimeras in the presence or absence of p75 expression. Given the intriguing results seen for TrkA IgG-C1, we predicted that this subdomain may be surface-exposed in the tertiary structure of the receptor. This hypothesis is based on the fact that surface structures generally correlate with access to a ligand or with the ability to induce conformational changes (27Saragovi H.U. Greene M.I. Chrusciel R.A. Kahn M. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 28Saragovi H.U. Burgess K. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents. 1999; 9: 737-751Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Immunogenicity is an accepted criterion for testing surface exposure of receptors (29Morgan D.O. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1364-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Soos M. Siddle K. Baron M. Heward J. Luzio J. Bellatin J. Lennox E. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We used anti-TrkA antiserum RTA generated by immunization with whole TrkA-ECD (25Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The serum was affinity-purified using native TrkA-ECD to trap RTA immunoglobulins. These antibodies react only with surface-exposed epitopes of the extracellular domain, because the immunoglobulins directed to buried or masked epitopes would not have been affinity-purified. HEK293 cells expressing the Trk chimeras were tested by Western blotting with purified RTA immunoglobulins (Fig.4). Chimeras 2.2 (containing TrkA LRM, Cys 2, and IgG-C1) and 3.1 (containing TrkA IgG-C1) show high reactivity to RTA serum, while chimera 4.1 (containing TrkA IgG-C2) shows lower reactivity. Untransfected HEK293 cells and chimeras 1.1 and 2.1 show no reactivity with purified RTA immunoglobulins. Since the 2.2 and the 3.1 chimera share the IgG-C1 subdomain, the data indicate that the IgG-C1 subdomain and to a much lower degree the IgG-C2 subdomain are surface-exposed in the architecture of the TrkA receptor. Our studies define four issues of neurotrophin receptor biology. First, we show that the IgG-C1 subdomain is surface-exposed and plays a regulatory role in receptor activation and perhaps in low affinity ligand binding. Second, NGF binds to the IgG-C2 domain of TrkA. Third, we identify extracellular subdomains relevant for TrkA or TrkB activation by cognate (NGF or BDNF, respectively) and heterologous (NT-3) ligands. Fourth, we show that p75 modulates the Trk subdomains necessary for ligand-dependent activation. Based on decrease or loss of BDNF and NT-3 responsiveness in the 4.1 chimera (compared with wild type receptors), we conclude that BDNF-TrkB and NT-3-TrkB activation is mediated by the IgG-C2 subdomain. Based on a decrease in BDNF and NT-3 responsiveness in the 2.2 chimera compared with the 2.1 chimera, we conclude that BDNF-TrkB and NT-3-TrkB activation also requires the IgG-C1 subdomain. The functional role of the IgG-C1 subdomain is further supported by ligand-independent activation of the 3.1 chimera. In related studies of TrkB/TrkC chimeras, only the IgG-C2 subdomain of TrkB bound BDNF, and the IgG-C1 did not (7Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D. Parada L. Presta L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). If the IgG-C1 affects activity in the absence of direct ligand binding, this would suggest a regulatory or allosteric role in maintaining receptor conformation, and this possibility is supported by a surface exposure of IgG-C1 within the Trk architecture. The subdomains used by BDNF and NT-3 to activate TrkB change when p75 is co-expressed. In the presence of p75 co-receptors, the N-terminal subdomains of TrkB (LRM and Cys-2) are necessary for optimal activation by BDNF (Fig. 3, compare B with G). Also, whether or not p75 co-receptors are present, NT-3 activates the chimeric 4.1 receptor (IgG-C2 subdomain of TrkA) to a level comparable with wild type TrkA but different from wild type TrkB. The presence of p75 reportedly makes NT-3 inefficient at activating via wild type TrkA (18Brennan C. Rivas-Plata K. Landis S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of p75 in enhancing NT-3 activation of the 4.1 chimera could be due either to enhanced NT3-TrkA IgG-C2 interactions or to NT-3 binding to other subdomains of TrkB (31Ninkina N. Grashchuck M. Buchman V. Davies A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13019-13025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Changes induced by p75 in Trk subdomain ligand docking sites explain the mechanism wherein BDNF and NT-3 activate wild type TrkB equally, but in the presence of p75 co-receptors BDNF activates better than NT-3 (19Bibel M. Hoppe E. Barde Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 616-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type TrkA, in the 4.1 chimera NGF-TrkA activation is optimal. Thus, NGF responsiveness occurs via the IgG-C2 subdomain of TrkA when p75 co-receptors are not expressed. However, in the presence of p75, NGF activates the 4.1 chimera to a lower level than it does with wild type TrkA. Therefore, p75 restricts the efficacy of activation in this chimera. In contrast, when p75 co-receptors are expressed, the 1.1 chimera gains NGF activation. This change in subdomain utilization may involve a p75-mediated allosteric regulation of Trk receptors or a direct interaction of p75 with the TrkA Cys-1-rich motif. Our data are consistent with the literature, where the interactions of NGF-p75 enhance wild type TrkA ligand selectivity and affinity (3Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M.

Additionally, we cannot exclude a conformational effect of p75 upon the neurotrophins themselves. This has been proposed previously, wherein an anti-NGF antibody blocked all of the neuritogenic but not the trophic action of NGF (20MacPhee I.J. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23547-23551Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Maliartchouk S. Saragovi H.U. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kohn J. Aloyz R. Toma J.

It is generally accepted that receptor dimerization and conformational changes must occur for activation and signaling. Regulatory subdomains have been shown to inhibit ligand-independent dimerization activation of other receptors (34Livnah O. Johnson D.L. Stura E.A. Farrell F.X. Barbone F.P. You Y. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. He W. Krause C.D. Pestka S. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 35Remy I. Wilson I. Michnick S. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and the steric constraints are removed by conformational changes upon ligand binding. The IgG-C1 subdomain of TrkA plays a key role in regulation of ligand-independent activation. It is also attractive to speculate that the p75-mediated reduction of ligand-independent activation seen in all Trks may be due to an interaction of p75 with the IgG-C1 subdomain. The constitutive activation seen in the 3.1 chimera suggests either a negative regulation by TrkB IgG-C1 (which has been replaced) or an activating property specific to TrkA IgG-C1 (which has been introduced). Like the 3.1 chimera, the 2.2 chimera also contains the TrkA IgG-C1 subdomain but is not constitutively activated. Hence, it is possible that the additional TrkA subdomains in the 2.2 chimera (LRM and Cys-2) restrict ligand-independent activation by the IgG-C1 subdomain. TrkA IgG-C1 deletions and a mutation also show constitutive activation (36Arevalo J. Conde B. Hempstead B. Chao M. Martin-Zanca D. Perez P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5908-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 37Arevalo J. Conde B. Hempstead B. Chao M. Martin-Zanca D. Perez P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), as does a Cys to Ser substitution in the IgG-C2 subdomain (38Coulier F. Kumar R. Ernst M. Klein R. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, others proposed a role for the IgG-C1 subdomain in neurotrophin binding (7Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Shelton D. Parada L. Presta L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2795-2805Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 9Urfer R. Tsoulfas P. O'Connell L. Hongo J. Zhao W. Presta L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5829-5840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together these data point to a critical role of the IgG-C1 domain in regulation of function. We conclude that (i) Trk receptors have distinct ligand binding and regulatory subdomains, (ii) p75-mediated regulation of activation requires the N-terminal subdomains of Trk, (iii) there are multiple NTF docking sites for Trk (some are preferred and some allosteric (perhaps corresponding to high and low affinity, respectively)), and (iv) regulation of activation by the TrkA IgG-C1 subdomain is different from regulation by the TrkB IgG-C1 subdomain, based on the 3.1 chimera effect."

Although a putative human type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) gene (hDio2) encoding a similar selenoprotein has been identified, basal D2 activity is not selenium (Se)-dependent nor has D2 been labeled with75Se. A human mesothelioma cell line (MSTO-211H) has recently been shown to have ∼40-fold higher levels ofhDio2 mRNA than mesothelial cells. Mesothelioma cell lysates activate thyroxine (T4) to 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine with typical characteristics of D2 such as low K m (T4), 1.3 nm, resistance to propylthiouracil, and a short half-life (∼30 min). D2 activity is ∼30-fold higher in Se-supplemented than in Se-depleted medium. An antiserum prepared against a peptide deduced from theDio2 mRNA sequence precipitates a 75Se protein of the predicted 31-kDa size from 75Se-labeled mesothelioma cells. Bromoadenosine 3′5′ cyclic monophosphate increases D2 activity and 75Se-p31 ∼2.5-fold whereas substrate (T4) reduces both D2 activity and 75Se-p31 ∼2–3-fold. MG132 or lactacystin (10 µm), inhibitors of the proteasome pathway by which D2 is degraded, increase both D2 activity and 75Se-p31 3–4-fold and prevent the loss of D2 activity during cycloheximide or substrate (T4) exposure. Immunocytochemical studies with affinity-purified anti-hD2 antibody show a Se-dependent increase in immunofluorescence. Thus, human D2 is encoded by hDio2 and is a member of the selenodeiodinase family accounting for its highly catalytic efficiency in T4 activation.

The first of these enzymes to be cloned was the type 1 iodothyronine deiodinase (D1), which revealed a rare structural characteristic,i.e. the presence of the selenocysteine (Sec) codon, UGA, in the active center of the enzyme conferring an ∼200-fold higher catalytic efficiency than sulfur in the deiodination reaction (1Berry M.J. Banu L. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 349: 438-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). It also revealed a requirement for a stem loop structure in the 3′-untranslated region, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element (2Berry M.J. Banu L. Chen Y.Y. Mandel S.J. Kieffer J.D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), which is found in all eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs described to date (3Low S.C. Berry M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 203-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The most recently cloned deiodinase is the type 2 (D2), a propylthiouracil (PTU)-resistant, low K m(T4) obligate outer ring deiodinase that catalyzes T4 to T3 conversion (4Croteau W. Davey J.C. Galton V.A. St Germain D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Salvatore D. Bartha T. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3308-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The major open reading frame of the hD2 cDNA encodes a putative ∼31-kDa protein with high similarity of the Sec-containing active center of the putative D2 enzyme with those of D1 and the other member of this group, type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase (D3) (6St. Germain D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Croteau W. Kanamori A. Wang Z. Brown D.D. Galton V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7767-7771Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a SECIS element has been identified in the extreme 3′-untranslated region of both the human and highly homologous chicken Dio2 genes (7Buettner C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33374-33378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,8Gereben B. Bartha T. Tu H.M. Harney J.W. Rudas P. Larsen P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13768-13776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Human, mouse, rat, chicken, and frog D2 all contain a putative in-frame UGA codon in the deduced amino acid sequence of the active center (position 133 in hD2) and therefore all are considered to be selenoenzymes (8Gereben B.

Despite this evidence, there is vigorous disagreement that D2 is a selenoprotein, with some investigators claiming that Dio2encodes a “virtual” or artificial selenoprotein that is not expressed in humans or rats (9Safran M.

Three major arguments support this position, namely 1) the failure of Se deficiency to reduce D2 catalytic activity either in vivo or in vitro (9Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13477-13480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chanoine J.P. Safran M. Farwell A.P. Tranter P. Ekenbarger D.M. Dubord S. Alex S. Arthur J.R. Beckett G.J. Braverman L.E.

Leonard D.M. Safran M. Wu R. Zapp M.L. Farwell A.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and 3) the inability to identify immunoreactive protein by Western analysis, immunoprecipitation (IP), or immunocytochemistry using antibodies prepared against peptides deduced from the sequence of the putative D2 mRNA (4Croteau W. Davey J.C. Galton V.A. St Germain D.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). An alternative scenario put forward is that D2 is a large protein complex (200 kDa) containing one or more 29-kDa substrate-binding subunits (p29), an ∼60-kDa cAMP-induced activation protein, and one or more catalytic subunits (12Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16363-16368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Rat p29 was identified in astrocytes byN-bromoacetyl-T4 labeling (17Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20561-20567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Safran M.

Monaghan A.P. Blumenstock C. Niehrs C. Nature. 1998; 391: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Although many of these apparent discrepancies could be explained by low expression of a highly efficient enzyme, reservations as to the identity of D2 are expressed even in recent reviews of the subject (21Kohrle J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,22Kohrle J. Acta Med. Austriaca. 2000; 27: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A mesothelioma cell line, MSTO-211H, was recently shown to express large amounts of Dio2 mRNA by microarray analysis (accession number U53506), offering a potential system to resolve the issue of D2 identity (23Rihn B.H. Mohr S. McDowell S.A. Binet S. Loubinoux J. Galateau F. Keith G. Leikauf G.D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MG132 and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and dissolved in Me2SO. MG132 is a reversible proteasome inhibitor. Lactacystin blocks proteasome activity by targeting the catalytic β-subunit and covalently inhibiting the chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like activities. T4, cycloheximide (CX), and 8-bromoadenosine 3′5′ cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) were from Sigma and were dissolved in 40 mm NaOH (T4) or Me2SO. Protein G plus/protein A-agarose solution was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA). Outer ring-labeled [125I]T4 (specific activity, 4400 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Na2[75Se]O3 was kindly provided by the University of Missouri Research Reactor, courtesy of Drs. Marla Berry and Dolph L. Hatfield. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) and mesothelial (MeT-5A) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) and made available through Dr. Rihn. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown until confluence in RPMI or M-199, respectively, and supplemented with 0–10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Human embryonic kidney epithelial cells (HEK-293) cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0 or 10% fetal bovine serum. Each experiment was performed with duplicate dishes for each condition, and control plates contained the respective vehicles, 0.2% Me2SO and/or 0.6 mm NaOH. At the appropriate times, cells were harvested and processed for D2 activity in the presence of 1 mm PTU as described previously (24Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results are reported as fmol T4deiodinated/mg protein·min ± S.D. In some experiments D2 was transiently expressed in HEK-293. Cells were transfected by the CaPO4 method as described previously (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with plasmids containing wild type D2 (KD2-SelP), a D2 mutant in which the Sec-133 (but not Sec-266) was replaced by Cys (CysD2), or a CysD2 in which the SECIS element was deleted (CysD2ΔXba). This was performed as described previously (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) after cells were labeled with 4–6 µCi of Na2[75Se]O3/dish. The lysis buffer contained 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The 2,000-rpm supernatant of each cell lysate was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with D2 rabbit antisera 85254 at final dilution of 1:100 (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 30 µl of protein G plus/protein A-agarose solution were added per tube and incubated under slow agitation for 2 h at 4 °C. The IP pellets were washed once with lysis buffer and once with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. Pellets were re-suspended in sample loading buffer and analyzed in 12% SDS-PAGE. In some experiments IP was processed in unlabeled cells to allow measurement of D2 activity. For the affinity purification of the antiserum 45618 (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) the keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate of the hD2 peptide (EVRSWLEKNFSKR; residues 253 to 265) used to immunize the rabbits was coupled to agarose resin using Amino-Link agarose gel (Pierce) following the manufacture's instructions. The column was regenerated by washing with 3 m sodium acetate (pH 4.5) and equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to each cycle. The D2 antiserum (45618) was passed through the column five times and then washed 10 times with PBS. Bound antibodies were eluted with 3 msodium acetate (pH 4.5), and eluates were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 2 days. This affinity-purified antiserum (AP-45618; 1:400) was used in the immunocytochemical and Western analysis of MSTO-211H or MeT-5A cells as described (26Gereben B. Goncalves C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This was performed as described previously (27Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). MSTO-211H and MeT-5A cells were grown directly in glass slides for 24 h, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and then blocked for 30 min with 1.0% anti-goat serum, 1.0% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Affinity-purified rabbit D2 antibody (AP-45618) was used at 1:500 followed by incubation with 1.25 µg/ml goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). In the co-localization experiments, the affinity-purified anti-goat GRP78/BiP (dilution 1:20) antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc., Flanders, NJ) was used simultaneously with anti-D2 antibody. This was followed by incubation with donkey anti-goat rhodamine F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate. Mesothelioma (MSTO-211H) cell sonicate converts T4to T3 with kinetic properties typical of native D2, namely a K m for T4 of ∼1.0 nm and insensitivity to inhibition by 1 mm PTU as shown in the Lineweaver-Burk plot (Fig.1 A). Neither D1 nor D3 activities were detected nor did the transformed normal mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) express D2 activity (not shown). D2 activity in MSTO-211H cells was highly Se-dependent. Basal activity was decreased 4-fold by reducing the concentration of FBS containing endogenous selenoproteins (Fig. 1 B). That these changes are specifically caused by Se deficiency and not by other components in FBS is evident from the fact that Se supplementation progressively increased D2 activity at each concentration of FBS, from 2–3-fold at 10% FBS up to ∼30-fold when no FBS was present (Fig. 1 B). The Lineweaver-Burk plots from cells incubated in the absence of FBS with or without 100 nm Na2SeO3 for 24 h shows an ∼16-fold increase in V maxwith no change in the K m (Fig. 1 A). A dose-response curve of D2 activity versusNa2SeO3 concentration indicated that the maximum stimulatory effect is obtained at 100 nm. A time-response curve showed that an effect of Se is present after 2 h, but the full effect requires 8 h (not shown). Similar effects of Se to increase D2 activity were observed in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing Sec-encoding D2 mRNA. Exposure to 100 nm Na2SeO3 for 24 h increased D2 activity by ∼10-fold suggesting this effect is primarily post-transcriptional (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that the MSTO-211H cells express a selenoprotein containing a deduced D2 epitope, cells were labeled with Na2[75Se]O3 for 24 h and processed for D2 IP using an anti-hD2 peptide antiserum (85254) (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mesothelial (MeT-5A) cells were used as negative controls. Four75Se-labeled bands of ∼70, 58, 25, and 18 kDa (but not 31 kDa) are present in the SDS-PAGE of total cell lysates of MSTO-211H or MeT-5A cells (Fig. 1 C, b). These75Se-labeled proteins are increased by incubation with 100 nm Na2SeO3 in MSTO-211H cells but are decreased in MeT-5A (Fig. 1 C, b). SDS-PAGE analysis of the anti-D2 IP of the MSTO-211H cell lysate revealed an ∼31-kDa 75Se-labeled doublet band (p31) of the predicted size of hD2, the intensity of which is increased ∼2-fold in the presence of 100 nm Na2SeO3 (Fig.1 C, c and d). A doublet is seen when hD2 cDNA is transiently expressed because of the presence of a second UGA at the 3′-end of the open reading frame that can be translated either as a Sec or as a stop codon (28Salvatore D. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 1-4Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The content of all other 75Se-labeled proteins is reduced in the anti-D2 IP pellets (Fig. 1 C, c). IP of non-labeled cell lysates reduced D2 activity ∼20%, and ∼13of this activity can be recovered from the washed IP pellet (Fig.1 D). Addition of the antiserum to the cell lysate did not inhibit D2 activity nor did exposure to preimmune serum or protein A-Sepharose (not shown). Despite these IP results, we were unable to consistently visualize D2 by Western blot analysis of MSTO-211H cell lysates using affinity-purified anti-D2 antibody (AP-45618). The hD2 gene contains a canonical cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding site about 90 base pairs 5′ to the most 5′-transcription start site (29Bartha T. Kim S.W. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Tu H.M. Harney J.W. Rudas P. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). D2 activity increases in cells treated for 6 h with 8-Br-cAMP in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 A). To test whether there is a correlation between 8-Br-cAMP-induced D2 activity and p31, cells treated with 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP were labeled with 75Se and processed for D2 IP. The intensity of the75Se-p31 band increased ∼2.5-fold in 8-Br-cAMP-treated cells (Fig. 2 F). No effects of insulin (0.1–5 µm) or tumor necrosis factor-α (0.01–10 ng/ml) on D2 activity were detected (data not shown). Both endogenous and transiently expressed D2 have a short-life (<1 h) that is reduced further by exposure to substrates such as 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine or T4 (24Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 1164-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is explained by ubiquitin conjugation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the ubiquitinated D2 (25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Gereben B. Goncalves C. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with 100 µm CX for 1 h resulted in a rapid loss of D2 activity, compatible with a D2 half-life of <30 min (Fig.2 B). The decrease in D2 activity was prevented by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (10 µm) (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, exposure to MG132 increased D2 activity up to ∼4-fold, with similar results obtained with 10 µm lactacystin (Fig. 2 C). Remarkably, anti-D2 precipitable75Se-p31, but not other labeled proteins, was also specifically increased by treatment with MG132 (Fig. 2 F). Exposure to substrate (0.01–10 µm T4 in 10% FBS) for 1 h caused a concentration-dependent reduction in D2 activity of up to 10-fold (Fig. 2 D), which again was blocked by MG132 (Fig. 2 E). This was accompanied by a reduction in the anti-D2 precipitable 75Se-p31 (Fig.2 F). MSTO-211H and MeT-5A cells were also analyzed by immunocytochemistry using an affinity-purified anti-D2 antibody (AP-45618). In MSTO-211H cells incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h, the cytoplasm showed mild staining for D2 (Fig.3 A). Treatment with 100 nm Na2SeO3 for 24 h substantially increased the intensity of the staining without changing the distribution pattern (Fig. 3 B). No fluorescence was detected in MSTO-211H cells incubated with secondary antibody alone (Fig. 3 C) or in Na2SeO3–treated MeT-5A cells incubated with affinity-purified anti-D2 antibody (Fig.3 D). To study the subcellular distribution of endogenously expressed D2, MSTO-211H cells were stained with D2 antibody (Fig.3 F) and co-stained with antibody raised against the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein GRP78/BiP (Fig. 3 G), shown previously to colocalize with transiently expressed D2 in HEK-293 and neuroblastoma cells (27Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Co-localization was confirmed by superimposition of confocal images (Fig. 3 H). The Se-supplemented MSTO-211H cells have the highest D2 activity reported to date in a human tissue (∼140 fmol/min/mg protein), ∼40% higher than in Graves' thyroid tissue (33Salvatore D. Tu H. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This high D2 expression permits the unequivocal demonstration that endogenous hD2 is a selenoprotein encoded by the Dio2 gene (5Salvatore D. Bartha T. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3308-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The present results satisfy a number of important criteria establishing the identity of hD2 as the product of the Dio2 gene. Furthermore, they allow confirmation that the endogenous human enzyme behaves as predicted from a number of studies using transiently expressed protein. The first important criterion to establish D2 as a selenoprotein is to demonstrate its Se dependence. Past studies showed that the elevated D2 in cerebral cortex of thyroidectomized rats is not reduced by Se deficiency (15Chanoine J.P. Safran M. Farwell A.P. Tranter P. Ekenbarger D.M. Dubord S. Alex S. Arthur J.R. Beckett G.J. Braverman L.E. Leonard J.L. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 479-484Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and that astroglial cells depleted of Se for 3–5 days did not have lower basal D2 activity (9Safran M. Farwell A.P. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13477-13480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there was about 50% reduction of the D2 activity in cAMP-treated primary astrocyte cultures after 7 days of Se deprivation, basal D2 activity was still not affected (34Pallud S. Lennon A.M. Ramauge M. Gavaret J.M. Croteau W. Pierre M. Courtin F. St. Germain D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18104-18110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, the central nervous system is well known to retain Se with high efficiency, which could explain why D2 synthesis is not impaired by Se deficiency (35Behne D. Hilmert H. Scheid S. Gessner H. Elger W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In MSTO-211H cells, on the other hand, Se depletion for 24 h reduced basal D2 activity by ∼4-fold. This decrease in D2 activity was specifically reversed by Se supplementation (Fig. 1, Aand B). In fact, addition of Se increased D2 activity by ∼30-fold in Se-depleted cells, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, a phenomenon that also occurs in HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D2 (Fig. 1, A andB). Selenium depletion of MSTO-211H cells also markedly reduces the levels of another selenoprotein, glutathione peroxidase (36Sandstrom B.E. Marklund S.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A second criterion met by the present studies is the 75Se labeling and immunological recognition of D2. A recent study could not identify the 75Se-D2 protein by IP using antibodies that were raised against the COOH terminus of full-length rat D2 or against the catalytic core of the enzyme (13Leonard J.L. Leonard D.M. Safran M. Wu R. Zapp M.L. Farwell A.P. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is not the case in the present studies (see Fig. 1 C and Fig. 2 F). Aside from potential differences in the antisera per se, which might be an issue, the D2 activity in rat tissue sonicates or stimulated primary astrocyte cultures are only ∼10% of that in MSTO-211 cells. Because of the higher D2 expression, we can demonstrate IP of D2 activity, as well as of a 75Se-labeled protein of the predicted size (31 kDa) from MSTO-211H cells (Fig. 1 C). This is the first demonstration of endogenous 75Se-D2. The75Se-labeled 31-kDa protein is increased by Na2SeO3, mirroring changes in D2 activity (Fig.1 C). A correlation between changes in D2 activity and the amount of 75Se-p31 is also evident during treatment with proteasome inhibitors (see below), 8-Br-cAMP, or D2 substrate (Fig.2). Additional immunological identity criteria were obtained by immunocytochemical studies using the affinity-purified anti-hD2 antibody. Staining was only present in MSTO-211H cells and was markedly increased by Se supplementation (Fig. 3, A–D). Furthermore, D2 co-localized with the endoplasmic reticulum-specific marker BiP as found previously in HEK-293 and neuroblastoma cells transiently expressing hD2 (Fig. 3, E–H) (27Baqui M.M. Gereben B. Harney J.W. Larsen P.R. Bianco A.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4309-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite successful IP of the D2 protein and activity, we were unable to visualize D2 by Western blot analysis presumably because of low antibody affinity for denatured protein, low D2 expression, or both. A short half-life and the acceleration of endogenous D2 degradation by exposure of cells to substrates observed in pituitary tumor cells and in cells transiently expressing D2 are reproduced in these experiments. A short half-life (<1 h) is characteristic of D2 in all cells studied (11Farwell A.P. Safran M. Dubord S. Leonard J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16369-16374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 24Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31St. Germain D.L. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and is explained by the fact that D2 is the target of selective ubiquitination and proteolysis by the proteasomal system (24Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This is also the case in MSTO-211H cells, in which D2 activity and 75Se-D2 protein levels were extremely sensitive to inhibitors of the proteasomal pathway (Fig. 2,B–E). It is remarkable that in GH4C1 rat pituitary tumor and transfected HEK-293 cells, treatment with proteasomal inhibitors for 1 h increases D2 activity by only ∼20% (24Steinsapir J. Harney J. Larsen P.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1895-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Steinsapir J. Bianco A.C. Buettner C. Harney J. Larsen P.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) whereas in the present study a similar treatment resulted in a 3–4-fold increase in activity (Fig. 2 C). This can be explained by a more rapid turnover of the enzyme in mesothelioma cells. Furthermore, as in pituitary tumor cells and transfected HEK-293 cells, exposure to T4, the preferred D2 substrate, accelerates the turnover, increasing ubiquitination and subsequent proteolysis, a phenomenon that can be specifically inhibited by treatment with proteasomal inhibitors (Fig. 2, D–E). These results demonstrate that the targeting of D2 to the ubiquitin-proteasomal system and the acceleration of its degradation are characteristic of this protein, regardless of the cell type in which it is present or whether it is transiently expressed or endogenous. In conclusion, the evidence developed in the present study unequivocally establishes that endogenous hD2 is a short-lived selenoprotein, the product of the human Dio2 gene, as well as the 90–95% homologous frog, chicken, mouse, and rat proteins. These findings are also consistent with preliminary data reported recently that targeted disruption of the mouse Dio2 gene eliminates D2 activity in brain, pituitary gland, and brown adipose tissue (37Schneider M. Fiering S. St. Germain D.L. Galton V.A. 12th International Thyroid Congress, Kyoto, Japan, October 22–27, 2000. Asia and Oceania Thyroid Association, Kyoto, Japan2000Google Scholar). From a broader perspective it is interesting to note that this is the second example of high levels of a selenodeiodinase in human tumor cells derived from a tissue that normally does not express deiodinase, the other being the high levels of D3 in hemangiomas (38Huang S.A. Tu H.M. Harney J.W. Venihaki M. Butte A.J. Kozakewich H.P. Fishman S.J. Larsen P.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether primary mesotheliomas also express high levels of D2 and what, if any, effects of increased rate of T4 to T3 conversion might have in these cells. We thank Dr. Stephen Huang for assaying MSTO-211H cell lysates for D3 activity."

Here we show that inhibitory signals elicited by TSP-1 did not alter the ability of inducers of angiogenesis to activate p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Rather, TSP-1 induced a rapid and transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). JNK activation by TSP-1 required engagement of CD36, as it was blocked by antagonistic CD36 antibodies and stimulated by short anti-angiogenic peptides derived from TSP-1 that act exclusively via CD36. TSP-1 inhibition of corneal neovascularization induced by bFGF was severely impaired in mice null for JNK-1, pointing to a critical role for this stress-activated kinase in the inhibition of neovascularization by TSP-1."

This chimera displayed continual signaling suggesting that the N-terminal third of CRF, when presented in proximity to the receptor, is able to cause activation.Biochemical characterizations of soluble ECD-1s include those of receptors for follicle stimulating hormone (28Schmidt A.

We report here the biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of a bacterially expressed soluble protein corresponding to the ECD-1 of human CRFR1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide SynthesisAstressin, cyclo(30–33)-[d-Phe12,Nle21,38,Glu30,Lys33]r/hCRF(12–41), was synthesized as described (20Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10575-10579Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The photoactive analog, [d-Tyr-Gly0-Bpa1]astressin was synthesized manually by the solid-phase approach starting from 1.5 g (0.64 mmol) of 0.43 meq/g p-methylbenzhydrylamine resin. The photolinking agent, benzoylphenylalanine (Bpa), was purchased from Bachem as the N-Boc-protected amino acid and was coupled using diisopropylcarbodiimide in 50%N-methylpyrrolidinone/dichloromethane overnight. Detailed synthetic procedures for similar peptides have been described (20Gulyas J. Rivier C. Perrin M. Koerber S.C. Sutton S. Corrigan A. Lahrichi S.L. Craig A.G. Vale W. Rivier J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) was modified by polymerase chain reaction to insert both a Myc-epitope following amino acid 31 and a FLAG-epitope following amino acid 119. This cDNA was subcloned into pSecTag2 HygroA (Invitrogen) (pSec-ECD-1). The integrity of the construct was confirmed by automated sequencing. Transfection of pSec-ECD-1 (∼10 µg) into COS M6 (∼10 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) was accomplished using the DEAE-dextran method (9Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). At 1, 3, and 5 days post-transfection, medium containing mNT-CRFR1 was collected and subjected to Western analysis using a FLAG antibody (Sigma). Medium from transfected COS M6 cells was enriched using FLAG-agarose (Sigma) immunoaffinity chromatography.bNT-CRFR1 Expression in E. coliA cDNA encoding amino acids 24–119 of human CRFR1 (9Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) was modified by polymerase chain reaction to insert a FLAG epitope following amino acid 119. The cDNA was inserted into pET-32a(+) (Novagen) with KpnI and XhoI (pET-ECD-1) and its integrity confirmed by automated sequencing. E. coli strain, Origami trxB gor (DE3)pLysS (Novagen) was chemically transformed according to manufacturers directions using pET-ECD-1. Bacteria were grown to an A 600 of 0.6–1.0 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C. The bacterial pellet was solubilized and sonicated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (10 ml/g weight pellet), yielding soluble bNT-CRFR1 as a thioredoxin fusion protein in the supernatant. This fusion protein was subjected to thrombin cleavage and enriched by affinity chromatography with S-protein-agarose (Novagen) prior to purification by reversed-phase HPLC with a Vydac C4 column (10 × 250 mm, 5-µm particle size, 300-Å pore size, number 214TP510) run in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid with increasing concentrations of CH3CN as the mobile phase. After thrombin cleavage, bNT-CRFR1 contains 24 amino acids at the N terminus composed, in part, of an affinity epitope tag (S-tag) and 8 amino acids at the C terminus corresponding to the FLAG tag. The sequence of bNT-CRFR1 is GSGMKETAAAKFERQHMDSPDLGT[human CRFR124–119]DYKDDDDK (the S- and FLAG-tags are underlined); the additional amino acids, GSG and DLGT, are part of the thrombin cleavage site and the multiple cloning site in the vector, respectively. In the HPLC purification, bNT-CRFR1 eluted at ∼35% CH3CN.Western BlotSamples were reduced, electrophoresed through 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Antibody to the FLAG epitope (Sigma) was used to visualize the proteins.Protein SequencePurified mNT-CRFR1 was deglycosylated (N-glycanase) before electrophoresis on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Bands detected via Western blot analysis in a parallel experiment were excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation.Size Exclusion ChromatographyLyophilized bNT-CRFR1 was dissolved in 25 mmNaHEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, at 0.150 mg/ml and filtered by microcentrifugation through a microporous membrane (0.45-µm Durapore ultrafree-MC Millipore/Amicon). The sample (∼100 µl) was injected onto a TSK-GEL G2000SWXL column (7.8-mm inner diameter × 30 cm, Toso Haas) equilibrated in the above buffer and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.CD SpectropolarimetryCD spectropolarimetry was conducted with an Aviv Model 62DS spectropolarimeter (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ) using the manufacturers 60DS software. Conditions of collection: (a) low ionic strength aqueous case, 11.7 µm bNT-CRFR1, 0.01m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, wavelength span 260–185 nm, collection frequency 1.0 nm/point, integration time 1.0 s, spectral band width 1.5 nm, data averaging 5 repetitions/spectrum; (b) high ionic strength aqueous case, 17.6 µmbNT-CRFR1, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 msodium chloride buffer, pH 7.5, wavelength span 260–195 nm, collection frequency 1.0 nm/point, integration time 3.0 s, spectral band width 1.5 nm, data averaging 10 repetitions/spectrum; (c) aqueous/organic mixed solvent, 5.9 µm bNT-CRFR1, 0.005m sodium phosphate, 50% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, wavelength span 260–185 nm, collection frequency 1.0 nm/point, integration time 1.0 s, spectral band width 1.5 nm, data averaging 5 repetitions/spectrum; (d) ligand structure induction studies, 12.3 µm bNT-CRFR1 ± 11.3 µmastressin, 0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.15m sodium chloride. Constant conditions for CD spectra a-d: temperature 25.0 ± 0.5 °C, path length 0.05 cm. No post-collection smoothing was applied to the data. Spectral deconvolution by the method of Bohm et al. (35Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) employed CDNN version 2.0c using the 33-membered basis set.Disulfide ArrangementAnalysis of the disulfide arrangement was carried out employing procedures described in Ref. 36Fischer W.H. Greenwald J. Park M. Craig A.G. Choe S. Vale W. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar. In a typical reaction, 30 µg of bNT-CRFR1 was dissolved in 100 µl of 50 mm MES, pH 6.2. To this was added 1 µg of enzyme (trypsin or endoproteinase Asp-N) and digestion was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptide fragments were resolved on reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by chemical sequence analysis on a PE-Applied Biosystems Procise 494 Protein Sequencer and by MALDI-MS on a Bruker Reflex time-of-flight instrument. The mass accuracy of this instrument is typically 1000 ppm.Reduction and Alkylation of bNT-CRFR1Purified bNT-CRFR1 (30 µg) was dissolved in 20 µl of 0.25m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride and 2 mm EDTA. To the solution, 2 µl of 10% aqueous 2-mercaptoethanol was added and reduction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 30 min. To the reaction mixture was added 5 µl of 4-vinylpyridine (20% in ethanol) and alkylation was carried out at 37 °C in the dark for 45 min. The alkylated product was isolated after reversed-phase HPLC. Completeness of conversion to the alkylated product was verified by MALDI-MS analysis.Radioreceptor AssaysBinding to Soluble ProteinsPartially purified mNT-CRFR1 was incubated in triplicate tubes with [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin (∼200,000 cpm) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide in 0.2 ml of HDB (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mmNaHEPES, pH 7.4), 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight at room temperature. The ligand-receptor complex was precipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope in the presence of goat anti-mouse antibody, normal mouse serum, and polyethylene glycol as described (37Sutton S.W. Behan D.P. Lahrichi S.L. Kaiser R. Corrigan A. Lowry P. Potter E. Perrin M.H. Rivier J. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1097-1102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was quantitated by γ-counting. Purified bNT-CRFR1 was incubated in triplicate wells with [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin (∼200,000 cpm) together with increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptides in 0.2 ml of HDB, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min at room temperature in MAGV microtiter plates (Millipore) precoated with 0.1% polyethylenimine. The mixture was aspirated under vacuum and the plates were washed twice with HDB, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and counts bound in the wells were quantitated by γ-counting.Binding to Membrane FractionsTransfection and binding to membrane fractions were performed as described (21Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.B. Berggren T.W. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Background ccounts/min (counts bound in absence of receptor) were subtracted from all counts/min. The K i for astressin and theB max values were determined by the LIGAND computer program; the K i for the photoactive analog was calculated by the PRISM (GraphPad) fitting program. All assays were performed at least three times.Photoaffinity LabelingFollowing incubation of the purified bNT-CRFR1 (100 µg) with [d-Tyr-Gly0-Bpa1]astressin (300 µg) in 0.25 ml of 50 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.4, for 90 min at room temperature, the solution was irradiated at 365 nm for 30 min at room temperature. The products were then purified on HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF and ESI on an ion trap instrument.RESULTSInitial experiments were directed at determining if a soluble form of the first extracellular domain of CRFR1 was capable of binding CRF family ligands. Because post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, might influence protein folding and/or ligand recognition, we sought to express a soluble form of the ECD-1 in mammalian cells. A soluble protein, mNT-CRFR1, secreted by COS M6 cells was found to be glycosylated (data not shown) and bind astressin withK i = 30 ± 10 nm (n = 3) (Fig. 1). The agonist urocortin displaces [125I-d-Tyr0]astressin bound to mNT-CRFR1 but another agonist, sauvagine, does not displace the bound radiolabeled antagonist. Based on N-terminal sequencing, mNT-CRFR1 was found to begin with residues SLQDQHCE. This sequence is C-terminal to the predicted signal peptide cleavage site (9Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1187-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) indicating that amino acids 1–23 are proteolytically processed during maturation.For further studies, another soluble form of the ECD-1 was expressed in a bacterial system. We used the information on the N-terminal sequence of mNT-CRFR1 to construct a cDNA which would encode a protein whose N terminus begins with Ser24. We also inserted a FLAG epitope after Ala119. This cDNA, cloned into the pET-32a(+) vector to yield a thioredoxin fusion protein, was used to transform an E. coli strain which contains mutations in both thioredoxin reductase (trxB) and glutathione reductase (gor), thereby enhancing disulfide bond formation in the cytoplasm. After induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and cell lysis, the protein, found as a fusion protein in the soluble fraction, was cleaved by thrombin, enriched by S-protein immunoaffinity chromatography and purified to near homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC. The purified protein, bNT-CRFR1, visualized with Coomassie Blue stain following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was found to migrate according to the predicted molecular size of ∼14 kDa.In order to characterize the purified protein, we analyzed its structure and behavior in solution by both size exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism and determined its arrangement of disulfides. Following lyophilization from trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN, bNT-CRFR1 was readily solubilized either in water or in a near physiological buffer (25 mm NaHEPES, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.5) at relatively high concentration (5 mg/ml). The UV absorption spectra (240–340 nm) of dilutions of the samples showed no evidence of light scattering, i.e. absorption at wavelengths longer than 310 nm (data not shown). In addition, the protein samples were quantitatively recovered after being subjected to filtration through a 0.45-µm microporous membrane which retains large protein aggregates. Most striking were the results of size exclusion chromatography. A single symmetrical peak with retention time consistent with those of other disulfide-containing proteins of similar masses was observed for bNT-CRFR1 (data not shown). No higher molecular weight species (aggregates) of the protein were found to elute prior to the monomeric form. Together, these observations indicate that the bacterially produced receptor is a relatively compact, folded protein that is soluble and monomeric under physiological conditions.The UV circular dichroism spectra of bNT-CRFR1 (Fig.2A) at low or physiologic ionic strength are dominated by the random coil, with a negative ellipticity extreme at 199 nm with mean residue ellipticity of −18,000 degrees cm2/dmol and a positive ellipticity peak at 227 nm with mean residue ellipticity of +2500 degrees cm2/dmol. Spectral deconvolution by the method of Bohm et al. (35Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) gives helical, antiparallel, parallel, β-turn, and random coil contributions of 7.8, 9.2, 3.1, 30.0, and 54.5%, respectively. Addition of TFE at 50% (v/v) to the low ionic strength bNT-CRFR1 solution resulted in the appearance of negative extrema at 223 and 208 nm and a positive peak at 192 nm. By inspection, this TFE-induced spectrum is highly helical; deconvolution gives helical, antiparallel, parallel, β-turn, and random coil contributions of 42.0, 2.3, 8.2, 22.1, and 38.5%, respectively. In order to determine if ligand facilitates the formation of secondary structural features of bNT-CRFR1, the protein was incubated with astressin at approximately equimolar concentrations, and the resulting CD spectrum (Fig.2 B) was compared with the arithmetic sum of the component spectra. The resulting difference CD spectrum (Fig. 2 B, inset) clearly shows the formation of CD spectral features at 223, 208, and 198 nm which correspond to the nπ* and exciton-split ππ* absorptions characterizing α-helix, respectively. Under the reasonable assumption that the micromolar concentrations used in the experiment in Fig. 2 B ensure that all the receptor and ligand are complexed, the data are presented in the figure in units of mean residue ellipticity. Because the number of residues of bNT-CRFR1 is 132 and that of astressin is 32, at equimolar concentrations of bNT-CRFR1 and ligand ∼80% of the observed CD signal is contributed by bNT-CRFR1. Undoubtedly, a small contribution to the change in secondary structure shown in Fig. 2 B (inset) arises from changes in the structure of astressin upon complex formation but, because it is not possible to determine the individual contributions of receptor and ligand to the difference CD spectrum, the data in Fig. 2 B (inset) are a strong qualitative indication of the effect of ligand binding on the structure of bNT-CRFR1.Figure 2Circular dichroism spectra of bNT-CRFR1.

Collection conditions are given under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to determine the disulfide pattern, bNT-CRFR1 was digested with trypsin under slightly acidic conditions to minimize disulfide exchange, and resulting fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. We noticed that nonstandard cleavage (between Leu and Ser) occurred during subsequent Asp-N digestion which was probably due to the high enzyme to substrate ratio employed. Two major cystine-containing fragments were identified (Fig.3). One fragment, termed T1, was found to consist of two peptides that contained one cysteine each (Cys68 and Cys102). N-terminal sequence analysis yielded two sequences corresponding with CRFR158–76 and CRFR197–110. The cal"

In contrast, invasion was induced by the TXA2-R mimetic U-46619, constitutively activated forms of the heterotrimeric G-proteins Galphaq (AGalphaq), Galpha12, Galpha13 (AGalpha12/13), which are signaling elements downstream of TXA2-R. Ectopic overexpression of pS2 cDNA and protein in MDCKts.src-pS2 cells and human colorectal cancer cells HCT8/S11-pS2 initiate distinct invasion signals that are Rho independent and COX and TXA2-R dependent. We detected a marked induction of COX-2 protein and accumulation of the stable PGH2/TXA2 metabolite TXB2 in the conditioned medium from cells transformed by src. This led to activation of the TXA2-R-dependent invasion pathway, which is monitored via a Rho- and Galpha12/Galpha13-independent mechanism using the Galphaq/PKC signaling cascade. These findings identify a new intracrine/paracrine loop that can be monitored by TFFs and src in inflammatory diseases and progression of colorectal cancers."

In humans, leptin deficiency occurs in some cases of congenital obesity and in lipodystrophic disorders characterized by reduced adipose tissue and insulin resistance. Cutaneous gene therapy is considered an attractive potential method to correct circulating protein deficiencies, since gene-transferred human keratinocytes can produce and secrete gene products with systemic action. However, no studies showing correction of a systemic defect have been reported. We report the successful correction of leptin deficiency using cutaneous gene therapy in the ob/ob mouse model. As a feasibility approach, skin explants from transgenic mice overexpressing leptin were grafted on immunodeficient ob/ob mice. One month later, recipient mice reached body weight values of lean animals. Other biochemical and clinical parameters were also normalized. In a second human gene therapy approach, a retroviral vector encoding both leptin and EGFP cDNAs was used to transduce HK and, epithelial grafts enriched in high leptin-producing HK were transplanted to immunosuppressed ob/ob mice. HK-derived leptin induced body weight reduction after a drop in blood glucose and food intake. Leptin replacement through genetically engineered HK grafts provides a valuable therapeutic alternative for permanent treatment of human leptin deficiency conditions."

We showed a switch from MAT1A to MAT2A expression at the transcriptional level in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that facilitates cancer cell growth. The purpose of the present study was to better understand the molecular mechanism of increased MAT2A expression in HCC. In vitro DNase I footprinting analysis revealed two protected sites (-354 to -312 and -73 to -28) using nuclear proteins from HCC and HepG2 cells, but not normal liver. These sites are also protected in HepG2 cells on in vivo DNase I footprinting analysis. These protected sites contain consensus binding sites for c-Myb and Sp1. In HCC, the mRNA levels of c-myb and Sp1 and binding to their respective sites increased. Mutation of the c-Myb or Sp1 site reduced MAT2A promoter activity by 67% and 50%, respectively. The importance of these cis-acting elements and trans-activating factors was confirmed using heterologous promoter and expression vectors.

https://openalex.org/W2031431898,"Zn-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a member of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family of proteins and is identical in amino acid sequence to a tumor-derived lipid-mobilizing factor associated with cachexia in cancer patients. ZAG is present in plasma and other body fluids, and its natural function, like leptin's, probably lies in lipid store homeostasis. X-ray crystallography has revealed an open groove between the helices of ZAG's α1 and α2 domains, containing an unidentified small ligand in a position similar to that of peptides in MHC proteins (Sanchez, L. M., Chirino, A. J., and Bjorkman, P. J. (1999) Science 283, 1914–1919). Here we show, using serum-derived and bacterial recombinant protein, that ZAG binds the fluorophore-tagged fatty acid 11-(dansylamino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA) and, by competition, natural fatty acids such as arachidonic, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids. Other MHC class I-related proteins (FcRn, HFE, HLA-Cw*0702) showed no such evidence of binding. Fluorescence and isothermal calorimetry analysis showed that ZAG binds DAUDA withKd in the micromolar range, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that ligand binding increases the thermal stability of the protein. Addition of fatty acids to ZAG alters its intrinsic (tryptophan) fluorescence emission spectrum, providing a strong indication that ligand binds in the expected position close to a cluster of exposed tryptophan side chains in the groove. This study therefore shows that ZAG binds small hydrophobic ligands, that the natural ligand may be a polyunsaturated fatty acid, and provides a fluorescence-based method for investigating ZAG-ligand interactions.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2359-2365PubMed Google Scholar), the wasting syndrome involving depletion of adipose and muscle tissue, such as occurs in many patients with cancer, AIDS, trypanosomiasis, and other life-threatening diseases. Significantly, ZAG is overexpressed in tumors that accompany fat loss, and exogenous ZAG produces cachectic symptoms in experimental animals (4Todorov P.T. McDevitt T.M. Meyer D.J. Ueyama H. Ohkubo I. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2353-2358PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hirai K. Hussey H.J. Barber M.D. Price S.A. Tisdale M.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2359-2365PubMed Google Scholar). ZAG, like leptin (6Friedman J.M. Halaas J.L. Nature. 1998; 395: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (4541) Google Scholar), therefore, participates in lipid store homeostasis, the dysregulation of which has serious implications for survival and the management of cancer and other diseases. ZAG is a member of a family of proteins typified by the class I MHC proteins (which present peptides to cytotoxic T cells) (7Madden D.R. Annu. Rev.

In contrast to all other MHC-like proteins, ZAG and MIC-A (a divergent member of the MHC family) are not found in association with β2-microglobulin (β2M) as a light chain (12Groh V. Bahram S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ZAG reveals an overall fold that is very similar to that of MHC class I molecules (14Sanchez L.M. Chirino A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1914-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The spatial relationship between its three domains is slightly different from that found in class I MHC proteins, which may explain the lack of affinity of ZAG for β2M. As with all members of the family, a prominent feature of the α1 and α2 domains is a pair of opposing α-helices that enclose the binding groove for peptides or (glyco)lipids in MHC proteins. In FcRn, HFE, and MIC-A, the groove is closed, and there is no evidence for ligand binding within the region between the helices, although each interacts with other proteins (15Burmeister W.P. Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16Lebrón J.A. Bennett M.J. Vaughn D.E. Chirino A.J. Snow P.M. Mintier G.A.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 577-584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In ZAG, however, the x-ray crystal structure shows that the groove is open and contains an additional electron density ascribed to an unidentified ligand (Fig. 1) (14Sanchez L.M. Chirino A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1914-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The presumptive ligand appears curved and nonbranched and lacks the characteristic protrusions of either a peptide or carbohydrate structure. The molecular surface of the central part of the groove where the unresolved density lies is nearly neutral in charge, except for an Arg side chain protruding from one side of the groove. The other residues surrounding the presumptive ligand are hydrophobic (three Trp, four Tyr, two Phe, and an Ile). Like CD1, therefore, ZAG may bind a hydrophobic ligand, although the groove in ZAG is not as deep as that in CD1 and could not accommodate lipids of the size and complexity of those bound by this protein. The nature of the ZAG ligand cannot be determined unambiguously from the crystal structure, because the electron density corresponding to the ligand may arise from a heterogeneous mixture of molecules or represent a loosely bound or large ligand only partially inserted into the groove. The nature of the ligand or ligands is clearly of potential importance to the biological function of ZAG. Moreover, if (like MHC class I) ZAG can bind different ligands of a biochemically similar class, then it is possible that the biological activity of ZAG varies with the precise nature of the bound compound. The nature of the ligand would be of relevance to homeostasis of body lipid stores and the management of disease conditions in which ZAG activity is detrimental to outcome. Given the chemical characteristics of the groove, and assuming that the unresolved electron density is a useful guide to the nature of the ligand, it is conceivable that the ligand is a fatty acid. Using fluorescent methods and microcalorimetry, we have found that ZAG can bind fatty acids and that one particular fluorescent fatty acid analogue may be particularly useful for screening ZAG ligands. Natural ZAG was purified from human serum using immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (13Sánchez L.M. López-Otı́n C. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For expression of ZAG inEscherichia coli, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to modify the cDNA encoding human ZAG to insert a 5′NdeI site before the codon corresponding to residue 1 of the mature protein and a 3′ XhoI site following the stop codon. The PCR product was subcloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) and sequenced, then subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET23a (Novagen). ZAG was expressed inE. coli strain BL21(DE)3pLysE, and the protein was renatured from inclusion bodies as described previously (18Garboczi D.N. Utz U. Ghosh P. Seth A. Kim J. VanTienhoven E.A. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5403-5410PubMed Google Scholar) and purified on a gel filtration column (HiLoadTM 26/60 Superdex 200 column; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein migrated as a single peak on the gel filtration column and exhibited a far-UV circular dichroism spectrum similar to natural ZAG isolated from serum (data not shown). Soluble versions of FcRn, HFE, and a class I MHC protein (HLA-Cw*0702) were expressed in CHO cells (FcRn and HFE) or baculovirus-infected insect cells (HLA-Cw*0702) and purified as described previously (16Lebrón J.A.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 603-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). All the proteins were greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Blue. The concentrations of the proteins were estimated by absorbance at 280 nm using theoretical extinction coefficients based on their amino acid compositions (21Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar) using the ProtParam program through ExPASy server (expasy.cbr.nrc.ca/tools/). The fluorescent fatty acids 11-((5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)amino)undecanoic acid (DAUDA) and cis-parinaric acid were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Oleic acid, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, γ-linolenic acid, cis-eicosapentaenoic acid, linoleic acid, palmitic acid, all-trans-retinol, and dansyl-α-amino-octanoic acid (DACA) were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK). The dansylated fatty acids were stored as stock solutions of ∼3 mg ml−1 in ethanol, in the dark at −20 °C, and freshly diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 171 mmNaCl, 3.35 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) to ∼1 μm before use in the fluorescence experiments. Competitors of fluorescent fatty acid binding were prepared as stock solutions in ethanol at ∼10 mm and diluted in PBS in the case of oleic acid or in ethanol for other competitors. Retinol was dissolved and diluted in ethanol immediately before use and binding to proteins was tested by addition of, typically, 5 μl of this directly to a cuvette containing protein in PBS. The concentrations of both DAUDA and DACA stocks were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient ε335 of 4800 m−1 cm−1 in methanol, ε303 of 76,000 m−1cm−1 for cis-parinaric acid in ethanol (22Haughland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 5 Ed. Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR1992Google Scholar), and ε325 of 52,480 m−1cm−1 for retinol in ethanol. Fluorescence binding emission spectra (uncorrected) were recorded at 20 °C with a SPEX Fluo-Max spectrofluorimeter (Spex Industries, Edison, NJ) using 2-ml samples in a silica cuvette. Raman scattering by solvent water was subtracted where necessary. The excitation wavelengths used for DAUDA, DACA, cis-parinaric acid, and retinol were 345, 345, 319, and 350 nm, respectively. Fluorescence data were corrected for dilution where necessary and fitted by standard nonlinear regression techniques (using Microcal ORIGIN software) to a single site binding model to give estimates of the dissociation constant (Kd) and maximal fluorescence intensities (Fmax). ITC experiments to measure the binding of DAUDA to ZAG were done at 25 °C using a Microcal VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter following standard instrumental procedures (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 24Cooper A. Johnson C.M. Jones C. Mulloy B. Thomas A.H. Microscopy, Optical Spectroscopy, and Macroscopic Techniques. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1994: 137-150Google Scholar) with a 250-μl injection syringe and 320 rpm stirring. Proteins were dialyzed against PBS, followed by addition of ethanol to match the ligand mixture (2.5%), and degassed briefly before loading into the calorimeter cell. Ligand (DAUDA) solutions were made up from ethanolic stock solutions by dilution (to 2.5% ethanol) in the same buffer. A typical binding experiment involved 25 × 10-μl injections of ligand solution (450 μm) into the ITC cell (∼1.4 ml active volume) containing protein (25 μm). Control experiments were performed under identical conditions by injection of ligand into buffer alone (to correct for heats of ligand dilution) and injection of buffer into the protein mix (to correct for heats of dilution of the protein). Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression in terms of a simple single-site binding model using the standard Microcal ORIGIN software package. For each thermal titration curve this yields estimates of the apparent number of binding sites (n) on the protein, the binding constant (K/m−1) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH/kcal mol−1). Other thermodynamic quantities were calculated using standard expressions: ΔG 0 = −RT·lnK = ΔH 0 − T·ΔS°. DSC to examine the thermal stability of ZAG and ZAG·DAUDA complexes was done using a Microcal VP-DSC, normally scanning from 10 to 100 °C with a scan rate of 60 °C h−1 (25Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Wadood A. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York2000: 287-318Google Scholar). Scans were repeated after cooling with the sample in situ to check for reversibility of the thermal unfolding transition. Protein samples (12.5 μm) were prepared as above for ITC, and both sample and reference (buffer) solutions were degassed prior to loading. In experiments with added ligand, the samples also contained ethanol (0.5–5%, depending on ligand addition), and separate control experiments were performed to confirm the absence of any significant ethanol effect on protein stability under these conditions. Normalized DSC data, corrected for instrumental baseline, were fitted to standard non-two-state models using Microcal ORIGIN software. Human serum-derived and recombinant ZAG, and control proteins of the MHC family, were obtained as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The naturally produced and recombinant ZAG behaved similarly in preliminary ligand binding and intrinsic fluorescence experiments, and only experiments using the natural protein are described unless differences were noted. Synthetic fatty acid analogues bearing environment-sensitive fluorophores were used to investigate fatty acid binding by ZAG. These compounds alter their fluorescence emission intensities and wavelengths of peak emission upon entry into protein binding sites. The most useful proved to be DAUDA, which is a saturated fatty acid with a dansyl fluorophore attached at its ω-methyl terminus, and has been used extensively in the study of fatty acid-binding proteins, from which it can be displaced by specific fatty acids (26Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Thumser A.E.A. Evans C. Worrall A.F. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DAUDA also binds to serum albumins, although it appears in this case to bind in the hydrophobic binding site for bilirubin (28Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Addition of ZAG to a solution of DAUDA was accompanied by a substantial increase in DAUDA fluorescence intensity and a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum wavelength from 543 to 512 nm (Fig.2 A). Control experiments with FcRn, HFE, or HLA-Cw*0702 under similar conditions gave no alteration in the fluorescence emission by DAUDA. The blue shift in fluorescence emission of the dansyl fluorophore indicates transfer from solvent water to an apolar protein binding site. A blue shift to 512 nm with DAUDA is substantial, but is less than that observed upon DAUDA binding to liver or intestinal fatty acid binding proteins (496 and 492 nm, respectively) (29Thumser A.E. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Veerkamp J.H. van Moerkerk H.T.B. Prinsen C.F.M. van Kuppevelt T.H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 192: 137-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tear lipocalin (490 nm) (31Gasymov O.K. Abduragimov A.R. Yusifov T.N. Glasgow B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); the most extreme blue shifts in DAUDA emission have been recorded upon interaction with unusual lipid-binding proteins from nematode worms (475 and 485 nm) (32Kennedy M.W. Brass A. McCruden A.B. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6700-6710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Kennedy M.W. Britton C. Price N.C. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. J. Biol.

Bradley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29442-29448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relatively small blue shift when DAUDA interacts with ZAG is perhaps indicative of a binding site that is more solvent-exposed than in lipid transporter proteins, such as would be expected for an open-sided binding groove. ZAG failed to produce any detectable change in the fluorescence emission of a fatty acid analogue in which the dansyl group is attached at the α-carbon (dansyl-d,l-α-amino-octanoic acid) or in the fluorophore alone (in the form of dansylamide). Consequently, dansylation close to the carboxylate of a fatty acid interferes with binding, and the dansyl group itself probably does not contribute to the binding. Fluorescence titration experiments in which ZAG was added incrementally to a solution of DAUDA provided an estimate of the DAUDA·ZAG dissociation constant (Kd = 4.2 × 10−7m; data not shown), which was similar to that obtained from calorimetry (see below). Addition of natural fatty acids to a ZAG·DAUDA complex resulted in a reversal of the fluorescence effect, presumably by competitive displacement of DAUDA into solvent (Fig. 2 B). Different fatty acids varied in the efficiency with which they did this on a molar basis, the ranking being docosahexaenoic > eicosapentaenoic > linolenic ≈ arachidonic > linoleic > oleic acid, but no changes were detected upon addition of cholesterol, deoxycholic acid, or arterenol (noradrenaline). ZAG was found to increase the fluorescence of ANS, which is generally regarded as a probe for exposed hydrophobic surfaces on proteins, and this change was also reversed upon addition of fatty acids (data not shown). ZAG failed to alter the emission of the intrinsically fluorescent steroid dehydroergosterol (which binds to liver fatty acid-binding protein (35Thumser A.E.A. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)), all-trans-retinol, 12- (9-anthroxyl)stearic acid (which binds to several different fatty acid-binding proteins (36Hsu K.-T. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13317-13323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar,37Storch J. Bass N.M. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8706-8713Google Scholar)), or cis-parinaric acid. The latter result is surprising given that cis-parinaric acid is known to bind to other fatty acid-binding proteins, including those that do not bind DAUDA (38Puerta L. Kennedy M.W. Jimenez S. Caraballo L. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1999; 119: 181-184Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This may, however, be due to the fact that this fatty acid is highly conjugated and may lack the conformational freedom to adapt to the ZAG binding site. Eicosanoids such as arachidonic acid, in contrast, are known to be more flexible and bind to proteins in different conformations. For instance, arachidonic acid binds in a hairpin conformation in adipocyte lipid-binding protein (39LaLonde J.M. Levenson M.A. Roe J.J. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25339-25347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in a more extended conformation in prostaglandin synthase, as does leukotriene A4 in leukotriene A4 hydrolase (40Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,41Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Soluble forms of proteins belonging to the MHC class I family, such as FcRn, HFE, and an MHC molecule (HLA-Cw*0702) all failed to bind DAUDA and ANS in control experiments. Thus, ZAG appears to specifically bind hydrophobic ligands, with an apparent preference for fatty acids, although many more types of natural ligand need to be tested for its true specificity to be understood. DAUDA may or may not bind to ZAG in a fashion analagous to its natural ligand(s), but it is likely to be useful in screening for natural ligands by competitive displacement. The characteristics of its interaction with ZAG were therefore investigated further. ITC experiments showed that binding of DAUDA to ZAG is exothermic at 25 °C, giving thermal titration curves consistent with simple 1:1 complex formation (Fig.3). Mean thermodynamic parameters for binding of DAUDA to ZAG, determined from a series of calorimetric experiments, are: Kd = 1.3 (±0.4) μm, ΔH 0 = −5.2 (±1.0) kcal mol−1, ΔS° = +9.7 (±3.8) cal K−1mol−1 (1 cal = 4.184 J). These data are consistent with the micromolar dissociation constants determined from the DAUDA fluorescence titrations and confirm that fluorescence methods, although intrinsically indirect and less precise than direct calorimetric methods, are sufficiently robust to be used for routine ligand binding studies in this system. The positive ΔS 0 for binding is consistent with an increase in solvent (water) entropy anticipated due to disruption of the hydration layer around the hydrophobic ligand. ITC experiments using the natural ligands were not feasible under the conditions used because of the poor solubility of the ligands at the concentrations required in the injection syringe. The serum-derived ZAG used here for binding studies was purified using similar procedures to those used for the original crystallographic work (though lacking the additives used for protein crystallization) and may be similarly loaded with competing natural (endogenous) ligand. Bacterial recombinant ZAG may also be loaded with the same or a related compound derived from the synthesizing cells. Although we have no direct evidence for such endogenous ligand(s) in our preparations, any competition for the binding site would serve only to reduce the apparent binding affinities for exogenous ligands that we have observed. The good fit of fluorescence and ITC titration data to simple binding models, with n = ∼1 stoichiometry, shows that endogenous ligand (if present) is exchangeable with DAUDA or natural fatty acids and would act simply as a competitive inhibitor in binding affinity studies. Consequently, the apparent ligand dissociation constants (Kd) determined here represent an upper limit for the true Kd, and the binding strength of ZAG for the natural ligand may be substantially stronger. Given that the Kd values obtained for ZAG·DAUDA were of a similar order of magnitude (micromolar) to those measured for interactions between lipids and lipid transport proteins (26Wilkinson T.C.I. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Thumser A.E.A. Evans C. Worrall A.F. Wilton D.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the binding may be sufficiently strong for the ZAG·ligand complex to remain intact during its passage from the synthesizing cell through blood and tissue spaces to the target cells. DSC experiments (Fig.4) showed that ZAG proteins undergo a typical endothermic cooperative reversible unfolding transition in solution with a transition midpoint (Tm) at around 65–70 °C under physiological conditions. Recombinant ZAG samples had the slightly lower thermal stability (Tm65 °C) compared with serum-derived material (Tm70 °C) under the same conditions, possibly because the recombinant proteins lack the ligand or N-linked carbohydrates (14Sanchez L.M. Chirino A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1914-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ZAG shows nine ordered carbohydrate residues arranged in a biantennary arrangement, attached to Asn239on a loop in the α3 domain directly beneath the platform formed by the α1-α2 superdomain, and other sites with N-linked carbohydrates are also evident (14Sanchez L.M. Chirino A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 1914-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The reduced stability of the bacterial recombinant ZAG is therefore probably due to the absence of these glycosylations, although the DSC data and the intrinsic fluorescence spectra (see below) indicate that the recombinant protein backbone is properly folded. Addition of increasing concentrations of DAUDA raised the proteinTm progressively for both the natural and recombinant ZAG by up to 5 °C with 200 μm added ligand. This is typical of the enhancement in protein folding stability generally observed in the presence of ligands that bind specifically to the native state (25Cooper A. Nutley M.A. Wadood A. Harding S.E. Chowdhry B.Z. Protein-Ligand Interactions: Hydrodynamics and Calorimetry. Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York2000: 287-318Google Scholar). It is important to emphasize here that the enhanced stability of the protein-ligand complex does not necessarily imply any conformational change in the protein (as is sometimes assumed), rather it represents simply the additional free energy required to dissociate the native protein-ligand complex before the protein can unfold. The results detailed above strongly indicate that DAUDA binds to ZAG at a hydrophobic binding site, from which it is displaceable by fatty acids. The simplest hypothesis is that the binding site is in the groove lying between the α1 and α2 domains, analogous to the peptide or lipid ligand binding sites of class I MHC molecules. The binding data, however, provide no direct evidence that this is the binding site in ZAG, and it is conceivable that DAUDA and fatty acids bind elsewhere on the protein. We therefore exploited intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in an attempt to localize the binding site. ZAG possesses eight tryptophans, three in the α3 domain, two at the extreme end of the groove and distant from the region occupied by the unresolved density, and three more that are closely grouped together in the groove immediately adjacent to the density. The intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of ZAG (λExc = 290 nm) peaked at 340 nm, and there was a gradual quenching and blue shift in λmax with successive additions of arachidonic acid (Fig.5); a similar spectral shift was found upon addition of docosahexaenoic acid (not shown). Subtraction of the spectrum of ZAG in the absence of added fatty acid from that of a ZAG/arachidonic acid mixture provided a spectrum peaking at 353 nm. This is indicative of the quenching of tryptophans upon ligand binding and that the tryptophans concerned emit at 353 nm in the absence of ligand. Emission at this wavelength is indicative of a tryptophan side chain fully exposed to solvent water (42Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 43Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A.

Such an effect would occur if the ligand were to alter the charge environment of a tryptophan side chain or if binding were to induce a conformational change in the protein. In either case, the results strongly indicate ligand binding at a site close to, or congruent with, the position of the unresolved density. These data demonstrate that ZAG can bind hydrophobic compounds and that the natural ligand may be a fatty acid, possibly a polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). These findings are mainly based on the binding by ZAG of a synthetic fluorescent fatty acid, DAUDA. The characteristics of this interaction, as quantified here by fluorescence and microcalorimetry, provide a basis for the screening of natural compounds for binding to ZAG by competitive displacement of DAUDA from the ZAG binding site. Use of this approach showed that ZAG can bind several different types of fatty acids, all of which are abundant in human tissues. Any preparation of ZAG will probably therefore contain a heterogeneous mixture of fatty acids, which would thereby provide an explanation for the failure to resolve the density found in crystals of ZAG. Even if DAUDA were not of the same generic class as ZAG's true ligand(s), and fatty acids are not relevant in vivo, DAUDA may nevertheless be valuable for the screening of hydrophobic compounds, natural or synthetic, for binding to ZAG. The shape and chemical environment of the unresolved electron density in the crystal structure of ZAG show characteristics commensurate with a fatty acid; it is a curved, nonbranched tube, which is embedded in a groove near a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids. Moreover, the only prominent charged amino acid side chain projecting into the groove is an arginine (Arg73), which is positioned ≤4.5 Å from one end of the density. Args and Tyrs are commonly involved in anchoring fatty acids in binding proteins. For example, the carboxylate of arachidonic acid is anchored by interactions with a pair of Arg side chains and a Tyr in adipocyte lipid-binding protein (39LaLonde J.M. Levenson M.A. Roe J.J. Bernlohr D.A. Banaszak L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25339-25347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in prostaglandin synthase by a salt bridge to an Arg and a hydrogen bond to the OH group of a nearby Tyr (40Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), arrangements that are also possible in ZAG. If, like class I MHC molecules and CD1, ZAG binds a variety of ligandsin vivo, albeit of a single generic class (peptides for class I, large, complex lipids for CD1), then it is possible that the particular fatty acid bound to ZAG may determine its biological effect. PUFAs in particular are notable for their pharmacological effects, and it is perhaps worthy of note that the fatty acid found to bind best to ZAG was DHA, which has recently been found to be an activation ligand for the retinoid X receptor in mouse brain (44de Urquiza A.M. Liu S. Sjöberg M. Zetterström R.H. Griffiths W. Sjövall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). It may also be pertinent that eicosapentaenoic acid (which also binds well to ZAG) in conjunction with tumor-derived lipid mobilizing factor induces lipolysis in cultured adipocytes, whereas DHA has no such activity (45Tisdale M.J. Beck S.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar,46Tisdale M.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 243S-246SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). It may therefore be possible to manipulate the biological effects of endogenous ZAG in clinical situations (such as cachexia) by direct administration of an appropriate ZAG-binding ligand or of an appropriate ZAG·ligand complex. All of the class I-type proteins require binding to a specific receptor for their biological activity to be fulfilled. No receptor has yet been described for ZAG, but it is conceivable that interaction with a receptor can be modified (favored or inhibited) by the presence of ligand and that the particular ligand so delivered then specifies the biologically activity of the recipient cell. An intriguing possibility, however, is that there is more than one receptor for ZAG and that different receptors discriminate different ZAG·ligand combinations, in an analagous fashion to MHC class I·peptide and CD1·lipid combinations interacting with their specific T cell receptor. The particular receptor activated may then determine the biological effect. Whatever the case, it is clearly important to establish the range of ligands that can bind to ZAG, those important in vivo, and how the biological effects of ZAG can be manipulated. We are indebted to Margaret Nutley and Fiona McMonagle for excellent technical help with the calorimetry experiments and protein preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2329104237,"ONYX-015, dl1520, is an adenovirus that lacks the E1B 55K gene and therefore lacks the capacity to neutralize p53 during infection. This virus induces high levels of p53 and fails to grow efficiently in primary epithelial cells. However, it does replicate in many tumor cells, including those expressing wild-type p53. In these cells, ONYX-015 fails to induce active p53. This is because the pathway from E1a to p53 is disrupted through loss of p14ARF. We propose that high levels of Mdm2 activity resulting from loss of p14ARF, and high levels of Mdm2 protein resulting from activated Ras prevent accumulation of functional p53 during infection of tumor cells that retain wild-type p53."

These moieties, although monovalent in comparison with their bivalent precursor IgG, do not suffer from the need to produce and assemble multichain oligomers like other members of the immunoglobulin family. scFv fragments have been shown to display similar (although not identical) kinetic and thermodynamic properties as Fab fragments of whole IgG (1Rajpal A. Kirsch J.F. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 40: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).

It is now possible to generate a scFv molecule against a target within a few weeks. However, since these libraries are usually generated from non-immunized sources and hence have not undergone affinity maturation, the isolation of high (subnanomolar equilibrium constant for dissociation) affinity scFv fragments from these selections is rare. Among the myriad applications of these molecules, the use of scFv fragments as intrabodies (intracellularly expressed antibodies) has received some attention recently. The aim of such attempts has been to neutralize the function of endogenous target proteins, using intrabodies, by several methods (5Marasco W.A.

Among these, the misdirected localization of the target to another subcellular region features as the most popular methodology employed. These initial promising results suggest potential applications for intrabodies in functional genomics (8Visintin M. Tse E. Axelson H. Rabbitts T.H. Cattaneo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The aim of this study was to determine the biochemical principles involved in the generation of effective intrabodies. We selected apoptosis (programmed cell death) as our model system, in which specifically caspase-3 was chosen as the target. Caspase-3 (CPP32/CASP3) is a member of a family of thiol proteases involved in programmed cell death (13Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys.

These proteases are initially synthesized as inactive proenzymes that are proteolytically activated by upstream activators upon apoptotic stimulation. Caspase-3 has been implicated as a downstream component of the apoptotic machinery and is involved in the proteolysis of several cellular components. Among the several moieties involved in apoptosis, at the time we initiated the project, it was most facile to generate caspase-3 protein in bulk quantities as antigen for the selection of scFv fragments. Other more attractive targets such as caspase-8 were difficult to overexpress in Escherichia coli due to loss of protein through aggregation. A panel of scFv fragments was isolated from a phage display library directed toward the antigen murine caspase-3 (mCASP3). These scFv fragments were tested for properties such as affinity for the antigen, protein stability, and intracellular accumulation to determine characteristics that define an efficient intrabody. In conjunction with these studies, the scFv fragments fused with an SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) were utilized to retarget antigen from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an effort to correlate intracellular behavior with biochemical parameters. Our data suggest that the stability of an intrabody is the most significant attribute, more so than affinity for the antigen, in dictating its effectiveness intracellularly. The intracellular stability of an intrabody was also found to correlate with the stability of the purified protein, as measured by urea denaturation under standard and reducing conditions. To our knowledge, this is the largest panel of scFv fragments against a common antigen that have been tested for intracellular stability and efficacy as intrabodies thus far. 293T transformed human embryonic kidney cells and BHK-21 baby hamster kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and gentamycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation studies, 1 × 106 293T cells were plated on 100-mm dishes and transfected with 10 µg of DNA using 30 µl of Fugene-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Green fluorescent protein-pcDNA3.1 was used a control, and transfection efficiencies were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of trypsinized 293T cells. 3 × 104 BHK-21 cells were coated onto coverslips in six-well dishes. 2 µg of DNA was transiently transfected into these cells using 4 µl of LipofectAMINE and 6 µl of Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were utilized for immunofluorescence investigations. The gene encoding mCASP3 was amplified from a mouse liver library (Stratagene) using gene-specific primers designed from published sequences (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U49929). The oligonucleotide primers 5′-CATGCCATGGAGAACAACAAAACC3-′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCGTGATAAAAGTACAGTTC-3′ were utilized to clone the mCASP3 gene into bacterial expression vector pET15b (Novagen). The oligonucleotide introduced a FLAG (DYKDDDDK) and a hexahistidine tag at the 3′-end of the mCASP3 coding sequence. The following primers were used to generate catalytically inactive protease by converting the active-site cysteine to serine (C163S): 5′-ATTCAGGCCAGCCGGGGTACG and CGTACCCCGGCTGGCCTGAAT-3′. Protein expression was optimized by selecting the highest expressing bacterial colonies, which were then grown in large scale (6 × 1 liter) at 37 °C until mid-log phase (A 600 ∼ 0.4). These were then induced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 4 h at 30 °C. The bacterial pellet was collected by centrifugation and lysed by sonication (5 × 1 min) in ∼50 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm Pefabloc-sc). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, Sorvall SS-34 rotor), and the cleared lysate was diluted in chilled lysis buffer to 200 ml. 5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) Superflow resin (QIAGEN Inc.) was added to the lysate and incubated at 4 °C with shaking overnight. The resin was collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm, Beckman GS-6) and washed three times with 50 ml of wash buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 200 mmsodium chloride, 0.5 mm imidazole, and 0.1% CHAPS). The resin was then packed in a column, and the protein was eluted with 15 ml of elution buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm DTT, 200 mm sodium chloride, 300 mm imidazole, and 0.1% CHAPS). The eluate was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 2 mm DTT overnight. The semi-pure protein (see Fig. 1A) was then loaded onto a pre-packed Mono-Q column (Hi-Trap, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed, and eluted with a salt gradient (0–0.5 msodium chloride in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 2 mmDTT). The coding sequences for the anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments were cloned into the SfiI and NotI sites of expression vector pUC119. This vector contains a pelBleader sequence that facilitates translocation of the protein into the periplasm. It also contains two tags, a hexahistidine and a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL). 1-liter cultures were grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium supplemented with 2% glucose, and 100 µg/ml carbenicillin until mid-log phase. The bacterial pellets were isolated by centrifugation, resuspended in 2YT medium supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 µg/ml carbenicillin, and shaken overnight at 30 °C. The cells were lysed by sonication in scFv lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 µg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm Pefabloc-sc) and purified with Ni2+-NTA in essentially the same manner as described above, except that 2 mm DTT was excluded from the purification protocol. After dialysis against PBS and concentration using Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc.), the scFv fragments were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 column in a fast protein liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions of the eluate from this purification step were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to isolate pure scFv (see Fig. 4for representative gel of one of the scFv fragments, 3C1-A2). The identity of the scFv fragments was verified by N-terminal sequencing of 12–19 amino acids and electrospray mass spectrometry. Two large phage display libraries (Cambridge Antibody Technology, Cambridge, United Kingdom) were panned to obtain anti-mCASP3 scFv fragments (2Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). ∼30 µg of purified proteolytically inactive C163S-mCASP3 protein was coated overnight in Maxisorb tubes (Nunc), and two rounds of selections were undertaken according to a standard protocol (2Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). The output from the libraries was grown in 96-well plates and induced for 4 h at 30 °C. Crude scFv preparations were obtained by resuspending the pellets in osmotic shock buffer (20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 1 mm EDTA). These were then screened for affinity for the target by soluble ELISA on an IGEN (Origen). Putative binders were isolated and organized into clonal groups depending on their restriction enzyme mapping pattern. Representatives from these groups were further analyzed by DNA sequencing. Standard techniques outlined by Morton and Myszka (18Morton T.A. Myszka D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 268-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) were employed in obtaining the BIAcore data. The chips were first cleaned extensively with 0.1% phosphoric acid, 1 m sodium chloride, and 100 mm sodium hydroxide. ∼6000 response units (RUs) of either anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) or anti-pentahistidine antibody (QIAGEN Inc.) was immobilized on the CM5 chip by standard amine coupling chemistry. These antibodies were used to capture ∼300–500 RUs of anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments. Then varying concentrations of C163S-mCASP3 (typically 10 nm to 1 µm) were injected into the biosensor at a flow rate of 10 µl/min and allowed to equilibrate with the reagents. The reactions were considered to be at equilibrium when the slope of the sensograms matched the base-line drift (caused by the gradual depletion of the scFv fragments from the capture surface). All data were normalized by subtracting the base line before computing the equilibrium constants for dissociation (K D). 48 h post-transfection, the medium was aspirated from the dishes, and the cells were washed with 5 ml of cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (0.25% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm sodium chloride, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0)) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete medium, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 4 °C for 90 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and incubated with 6 µg of anti-FLAG antibody (M2, Sigma) and 50 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) slurry overnight with constant mixing at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer before being boiled in 1.5× SDS gel loading buffer. The proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis on 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Novex) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by standard techniques. Western blot analysis was undertaken with a 1:4000 dilution of anti-Myc antibody (9E10) and a 1:1500 dilution of anti-FLAG antibody (M2). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a 1:3000–5000 dilution were utilized in conjunction with the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to visualize the results. A mixture of proteasome inhibitors was made with 10 mmbenzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(t-butoxy)-Ala-leucinal, lactacystin, and MG-132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal) (Calbiochem). A final concentration of 10 µm each was mixed with the growth medium and added to 293T cells transiently transfected with anti-mCASP3 scFv fragments (24 h post-transfection) for 24 h. The cells were then harvested, and Western blot analysis with anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was undertaken to determine the relative intracellular levels of the scFv fragments. Urea stock solutions were prepared according to details provided elsewhere (19Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1997Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 g of ultrapure urea (Fisher) was dissolved in a total volume of ∼100 ml of PBS. The final concentration of the solution was determined by refractive index measurements. Typically, 40 µg/ml scFv solutions were made in varying concentrations of urea, 100 mm PBS, and 100 mm sodium chloride and incubated at room temperature overnight. Protein denaturation was followed by measuring the change in the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra (at 320 nm) after excitation at 278 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B spectrofluorometer. The data were then normalized and fitted to simple two-state denaturation curves as described before (20Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The data were not used to compute free energies because our main purpose in doing the experiment was to obtain a qualitative ranking of the scFv fragments isolated from the phage display library. This rationale was then extended to obtain an estimate of intracellular protein stability by repeating the urea denaturation experiments in the presence of degassed buffer supplemented with 20 mm DTT as done before (21Wörn A. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). ∼48 h post-transfection, the transiently transfected BHK-21 cells were washed with PBS and fixed in fresh 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 45 min at room temperature. These were then quenched with PBS and 10 mm glycine for 10 min. The cells were washed with copious amounts of PBS, followed by permeabilization with a solution of 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS. After washing out the detergent with PBS (three to five times), the cells were blocked with PBS and 1% BSA for 1 h. The primary antibodies were diluted (32 µg/ml rabbit anti-Myc antibody (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and 20 µg/ml mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma)) in PBS and 0.1% BSA (PBS/BSA) and incubated with the cells in a humidifying chamber at 37 °C for 1 h. Excess antibodies were washed out by washing the coverslips with PBS/BSA three times for 10 min each. The cells were stained with 30 µg/ml anti-rabbit FITC and anti-mouse Texas Red antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted in PBS/BSA at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the cells were washed with PBS/BSA (3 × 10 min) and mounted in 50% PBS and 50% glycerol with 25 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Aldrich). The cells were viewed on a Nikon FXA microscope fitted with a CCD camera. A catalytically inactive mutant of murine caspase-3 (the active-site cysteine was converted to serine, C163S-mCASP3) was engineered to prevent any proteolytic degradation of phage display scFv fragments during the screening process. Purification of heterologously expressed C163S-mCASP3 was performed on Ni2+-NTA affinity resin, followed by a Mono-Q column (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 A (third and seventh lanes) shows the precipitate formed in the lysate and eluate, respectively. Typical yields of the final purified C163S-mCASP3 protein were in the vicinity of 3 mg/liter of medium. This yield may have been increased if precipitation of protein were minimized after elution from the Ni2+-NTA column. The final purity of the protein was determined by silver staining SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig.1 B). The observed band at ∼62 kDa is the dimer of protein, as verified by N-terminal sequencing of the first 12 amino acids (data not shown). It is unclear to us why this exists in the presence of a reducing/denaturing environment. The molecular mass (as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry) of the protein was similar to that expected from the amino acid sequence (33,284 Da versus the expected mass of 33,275.6 Da). >90% of the protein existed as a dimer in solution as determined by gel filtration chromatography (data not shown). Anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments were obtained by utilizing the full-length protein as a target in multiple rounds of screening against phage display scFv libraries. Input titers for each of the phage libraries were considerably high (≥1012plaque-forming units/ml). After the first round of selections, the output titers dropped significantly (103 plaque-forming units/ml). These phage were grown, and subsequent input phage titers were ∼1011 plaque-forming units/ml. As expected, the output titers for the second round were higher (∼20-fold) than those obtained for the first round. We decided to limit the selections to only two rounds in order to obtain clonal diversity in the positives scFv fragments yielded by the libraries. After a preliminary soluble ELISA screen of the outputs from the two libraries, it was determined that only the combined spleen library yielded binders (Fig.2A). ∼600 clones (six 96-well plates) from this library were grown, induced overnight, and osmotically shocked to obtain crude scFv. These scFv fragments were tested for antigen affinity by soluble ELISAs utilizing the IGEN. ELISA yielded 70 clones that displayed moderate to strong affinity for the antigen C163S-mCASP3 (electrochemiluminescence signal >104). The specificity of these clones was tested using other caspases (mCASP2 and mCASP8) as antigen in similar soluble ELISAs. The results demonstrated that the isolated scFv fragments were specific for their antigen, C163S-mCASP3, with negligible cross-reactivity against the other caspase family members (data not shown). The diversity in these clones was determined by restriction enzyme mapping using BstNI (Fig. 2 B). Clones that displayed similarly sized bands after the restriction enzyme digest were grouped together into clonal groups (total of eight). Representative members from these groups were then sequenced. As expected, members within a clonal group (as defined by theBstNI digest) had identical DNA sequences. However, upon DNA sequencing and subsequent translation into polypeptide sequences, three clonal groups had identical amino acid sequences compared with other groups (of the remaining five) and were therefore grouped accordingly. Representative members from the five distinct polypeptide groups of anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments were then isolated and cloned into eukaryotic and prokaryotic expression vectors. The scFv fragments were constructed in the VH-SS(GGGGS)3-VL format (where VH and VL indicate variable regions of heavy and light chains, respectively). A protein sequence alignment for the five scFv fragments selected is shown in Fig.3. The polypeptide sequences of the five scFv fragments are 50–70% identical, with the constant regions and the light chains displaying maximal similarity between the clones. As expected, the highest diversity between the sequences lies in the complementarity-determining regions (specifically regions H3 and L3).The five clonally distinct scFv fragments were subcloned and overexpressed in E. coli with subsequent purification to yield near-homogenous protein solutions (Fig.4). Fractions 12 and 13 were pooled and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry to verify the molecular mass and identity of the purified protein (data not shown). The oligomeric state of these scFv fragments was determined by gel filtration chromatography to be predominantly monomeric (data not shown). The identity and cleavage site of the N-terminal signal sequence of all five scFv fragments were determined by N-terminal sequencing. The affinity of these scFv fragments for the antigen C163S-mCASP3 was determined by surface plasmon resonance (Fig.5). All scFv fragments were tested for nonspecific binding using mCASP2, a non-reacting antigen, as analyte. The scFv fragments maintained affinity for the antigen C163S-mCASP3 tagged with an alternative epitope tag (the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (YPYDVPDYA) instead of FLAG) to ensure specific binding between the moieties. Both epitope tags on scFv (Myc and His) were utilized to capture on the CM5 chip to eliminate the possibility of nonspecific binding between components of the reaction. Only the equilibrium constants for dissociation were determined by the BIAcore analysis because obtaining kinetic information was precluded by complex kinetic behavior observed for some of the scFv·antigen complexes. The affinities for the antigen varied from ∼50 to 250 nm(Table I). TheK D for 3C1-A2 could only be estimated because slow association kinetics and only semi-equilibrium conditions prevented an accurate measurement for this scFv fragment. The value of ∼100 nm is an upper limit since measurements of ΔRU for injections of lower analyte concentrations (200 nm and below) were underestimated compared with those expected at equilibrium. Attempts to obtain kinetic/equilibrium data for the system in reverse (i.e. capturing antigen with anti-FLAG antibody and using scFv fragments as analytes) were unsuccessful. We hypothesize that the epitopes for these scFv fragments are inaccessible in this experimental system, or the capture of the antigen affects the secondary, tertiary, and/or quaternary conformation of the protein.Table IEquilibrium constants for dissociation of the anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments and the antigen as determined by BIAcorescFvK Dnm3C1-A2∼1001-aSee “Results” for an explanation.3C1-B151 ± 23C1-C4237 ± 263C1-D3252 ± 153C3-C166 ± 201-a See “Results” for an explanation. Open table in a new tab Western blotting of transiently transfected cell lysates was performed to initially determine the intracellular expression levels of the anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments. Fig. 6Ademonstrates that 3C1-A2 (first lane) was clearly the most intracellularly abundant among the five scFv fragments. The rationale for the lack of intracellular accumulation of the other four scFv fragments was not immediately apparent because of the absence of consensus PEST sequences (22Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar) (data not shown) and the substantial sequence similarity between the scFv polypeptides. Inhibitors were utilized to gauge the role of proteasome-mediated degradation of these intracellular scFv fragments. Upon soaking 293T cells with a mixture of these inhibitors, we were able to moderately increase the observable intracellular concentration of the four previously less abundant scFv fragments (Fig. 6, A and B, comparesecond through fifth lanes). The pcDNA3.1 lane in Fig. 6 B (sixth lane) is the vector-alone control. Urea denaturation studies were undertaken to determine the stability of each scFv fragment. These studies were possible only with three of the five scFv fragments due to the lack of starting material for 3C1-B1 and 3C3-C1. In nonreducing environments, the midpoints of denaturation (C m) for 3C1-A2 and 3C1-C4 were very similar and substantially greater than that of 3C1-D3 (TableIIand Fig.7A). These data agree with those obtained by Western blotting (Fig. 6 A), where 3C1-A2 and 3C1-C4 were the only scFv fragments clearly detectable. However, the large discrepancy between the expression levels of the two scFv fragments is not evident from the two similar C mvalues under nonreducing conditions. It is more evident with the data obtained in reducing environments (in the presence of 20 mmDTT) (Fig. 7 B). In the presence of reducing agents, theC m for 3C1-A2 was significantly higher than those for 3C1-C4 and 3C1-D3 (Table II).Table IIAssessment of the in vitro stability of three anti-C163S-mCASP3 scFv fragments by urea denaturationscFvNonreducing C mReducingC m 2-aUrea denaturation in the presence of 20 mm DTT.mm3C1-A25.41 ± 0.023.25 ± 0.013C1-C45.20 ± 0.022.93 ± 0.023C1-D34.52 ± 0.022.83 ± 0.022-a Urea denaturation in the presence of 20 mm DTT."

CHB is accompanied by ECG abnormalities including AV block, sinus bradycardia, and ventricular dysfunction. Our previous data indicate that these abnormalities are caused by maternal autoantibody-mediated disturbance of L-type Ca channels. To investigate the consequence of chronic exposure of L-type Ca channels in newborn pups to maternal autoantibodies during pregnancy, we immunized female rabbits with human 52 kDa-SSA/Ro (Ro52) recombinant protein. ECG revealed that pups from the immunized group had varying degrees of conduction defects. In addition, ICaL density and protein were reduced in hearts of pups from the immunized group. Sera and purified IgG from immunized rabbits inhibited IBa recorded from oocytes with expressed α1C and β2a subunits of L-type Ca channel. Pups ..."
https://openalex.org/W1982821013,"Despite the general assumption that widely used radiolabeled metabolites such as [(35)S]methionine and (3)H-thymidine do not adversely affect or perturb cell function, we and others have shown that such low-energy beta-emitters can cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of proliferating cells. The goal of the present study was to elucidate the targets and mechanisms of [(35)S]methionine-induced cellular toxicity. Comet analyses (single-cell electrophoresis) demonstrated dose-dependent DNA fragmentation in rabbit smooth muscle cells within a time frame (1-4 h) well within that of most radiolabeling protocols, whereas fluorescence analyses using a peroxide/hydroperoxide-sensitive dye revealed production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although ROS generation was inhibitable by antioxidants, DNA fragmentation was not inhibited and was in fact observed even under hypoxic conditions, suggesting that beta-radiation-induced DNA damage can occur independently of ROS formation. Studies with p53(+/+) and p53(-/-) human colorectal carcinoma cells further demonstrated the dissociation of early DNA damage from ROS formation in that both cell types exhibited DNA fragmentation in response to radiolabeling whereas only the p53(+/+) cells exhibited significant increases in ROS formation, which occurred well after significant DNA damage was observed. These findings demonstrate that metabolically incorporated low-energy beta-emitters such as [(35)S]methionine and (3)H-thymidine can induce DNA damage, thereby initiating cellular responses leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The results of this study require a reevaluation using low-energy beta-emitters to follow not only experimental protocols in vivo processes, but also acceptable exposure levels of these genotoxic compounds in the workplace and environment."

The binding affinity of CK14 and amelogenin was confirmed by dosimetric binding of CK14 to recombinant amelogenin (rM179), and to the tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide. The specific binding site for CK14 was identified in the amelogenin trityrosyl motif peptide (ATMP) of tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide and specific interaction between CK14 and [3H]ATMP was confirmed by Scatchard analysis. Blocking rM179 with GlcNAc, GMp, or CK14 with ATMP abrogates the CK14-amelogenin interaction. CK14 failed to bind to ATMP when the third proline was substituted with threonine, as in some cases of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta or when tyrosyl residues were substituted with phenylalanine.

Tissue Res. 1998; 38: 1-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and also cytokeratins 5 and 14 (3–5). Ninety percent of the enamel matrix protein constitutes amelogenins (6Termine J.D.

Amelogenins are tissue-specific, non-glycosylated proteins, rich in proline, glutamine, leucine, and histidine. Post-secretory processing of amelogenins involves a series of discrete steps including supramolecular self-assembly and progressive proteolytic reduction in molecular size, facilitating enamel biomineralization and maturation (9Fincham A.G. Moradian-Oldak J. Simmer J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 270-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Little is known about the presecretory and secretory stages of amelogenesis. Understanding of these events may shed light on the significance of the interaction of amelogenins with other ameloblast proteins, and the functional roles of the different domains of amelogenin polypeptide structures, including the possible significance of the highly conserved phosphorylation locus at serine 16, which remains enigmatic. While seeking to define the functional role of different domains of amelogenins, we have observed that the conserved tri-tyrosyl motif (amelogenin tri-tyrosyl motif peptide (ATMP):1 PYPSYGYEPMGGW) of the N-terminal region of amelogenins binds specifically toN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of glycoconjugates (10Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the ATMP also recognizes peptide mimics of GlcNAc (11Ravindranath R.M.H. Tam W. Nguyen P. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39654-39661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most importantly, one of the GlcNAc mimicking peptides (GMp: SFGSGFGGGY) binds avidly to ATMP. Modifications of the ATMP motif, including substitution of proline 3 by threonine as observed in a case of human X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta(12Collier P.M. Sank J.J. Rosenbloom J. Yuan Z.A. Gibson C.W. Arch. Oral Biol. 1997; 42: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), resulted in the loss of binding to both GlcNAc and GMp (10Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J.

Interestingly, the GMp sequence is localized in the highly conserved N-terminal domain of cytokeratins 14, 16, and 17. Since CK14 is a known marker for ameloblasts in a developing tooth prior to synthesis of amelogenins (3Tabata M.J. Matsumura T. Liu J.G. Wakisaka S. Kurisu K. Arch.

In the present investigation, we demonstrate that CK14 binds specifically to amelogenins through the ATMP. Furthermore, we show that putative loss of function mutations of ATMP (e.g.substitution of a proline residue with threonine, as noted above) abrogates binding of amelogenins to CK14. Using confocal laser microscopy, we demonstrate co-assembly of amelogenin-CK14, its migration to the apical region of ameloblasts, and subsequent dissociation at Tomes' process. Our findings suggest that CK14 functions as a chaperon for nascent amelogenin polypeptides during amelogenesis. Twenty-five normal, healthy, female Swiss Webster pregnant mice (Charles River Breeding) were used to obtain a sufficient number of litters for this study. All protocols involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Los Angeles, CA).

The polyclonal antibody (at 1/6000) binds better to rM166 (a construct that lacks the hydrophilic C-terminal 13-residue segment), than to rM179 at the same concentration (50 ng/well), suggesting that the C-terminal acidic residues are not essential for binding. The antibody did not recognize the N-terminal TRAP region in ELISA or in Western blots suggesting that it recognizes the hydrophobic central core of the amelogenin.

Polypeptides were purified by HPLC on a Vydac C18 300-Å (protein or peptide: 250 × 4.6 mm) column with a gradient of solution A (0.01 m aqueous trifluoroacetic acid) and solution B (0.01m trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), 0–100% B over 30 min, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The peptide was supplied in an aqueous solution. The peptides were stored in the absence of light and air at −20 or 4 °C, respectively.

Protein transfer was assessed by staining the PVDF strips with 0.1% Fast Green (Sigma) in 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and the strips were compared with Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands (11Ravindranath R.M.H.

Replicas were treated with ligands (GlcNAc, GMp) after blocking the membrane with phosphate-buffered saline, 1% HSA for 1 h at 37 °C. The membranes were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% HSA (11Ravindranath R.M.H. Tam W. Nguyen P. Fincham A.G. J. Biol.

After washing, the membranes were overlaid with CK14 alone or CK14 preincubated with ATMP for 1 h. The strips were washed (5 times) and immunostained with anti-CK14 monoclonal antibody for CK14 (clone LL002, 1/1000). 100 μl of [3H]ATMP (30 × 104 dpm in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.2) was added to 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes containing increasing amounts of CK14 in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and the mixture was gently shaken every 20 min for 2 h at 37 °C. The proteins were precipitated with 1 ml of cold ethanol (200 proof; Gold Shield Chemical Co., Hayward, CA) at 4 °C for 20 min, centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 ×g, and the supernatant was removed. The unbound [3H]ATMP was removed completely by repeated vortex mixing and washing four times with ethanol. The final pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of 1 n NaOH, and bound radioactivity was measured 15 min after adding 4 ml of scintillation fluid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a β-counter, as described elsewhere (10Ravindranath R.M.H.

The total binding of labeled ATMP to CK14 (350 pmol) was determined using increasing concentrations of [3H]ATMP (2–600 pmol). The nonspecific binding of labeled ATMP was determined in the presence of 40 nmol of unlabeled ATMP at 37 °C for 2 h and was subtracted from the total binding to obtain the specific binding. The specific binding was further analyzed by the Scatchard plot. Recombinant M179 on SDS-PAGE were electrotransfered to PVDF membranes at 100 mA for 1 h using a semidry transblot apparatus. Protein transfer was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. After blocking the membrane with 1% HSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C and washing, the membranes were overlaid with CK14 alone or CK14 preincubated (for 1 h) with ATMP or CK14 preincubated with T-ATMP or F-ATMP. The strips were immunostained with murine monoclonal antibody for CK14 (clone LL002, 1/1000). Mouse mandibular molar tissues for immunohistochemistry were fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 12 h at 4 °C. The fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and 6-μm saggital sections were mounted on Histostik-coated slides (Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp., Westbury, NY). Tissues for enamel morphometric studies were fixed in formalin for 24 h, decalcified with 10% EDTA. Day “0” mandibles were decalcified for 2 h (PN), day 1 for 4 h, day 3 for 30 h, day 5 for 66 h, day 7 for 108 h, and day 9 samples for 156 h, washed, and then processed for paraffin embedding. The serial cross-sections (6 μm) obtained from the whole length of the mouse mandibular incisor (PN 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) was taken as 100%. The sections were stained with Mallory's triple stain for 5 min and the width of enamel was measured at the 40 and 60% level from the base of the incisor using the software program Image-Pro Plus 4.0 (Media Cybernetics, L. P.) on 9 sections (three incisors from three mice) per day. Saggital sections (6-μm) of mouse mandibular molar of day 0 (NB), day 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 (PN) were deparaffinized and immunostained. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2.Tissue sections were treated with 1% HSA in PBS (pH 6.0) and then incubated with affinity purified mouse monoclonal antibody for CK14 (LL002, 1/500) at 37 °C for 1 h. Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with Tris-buffered saline and also IgG isotypes. Biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody was added to sections, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and rinsed (3 times). The sections were treated with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate for 30 min at room temperature and stained with hematoxylin:eosin. The images were photographed. To examine the spatial distribution and co-localization of CK14 and amelogenin, saggital sections of mouse postnatal mandibular molars at different developmental stages were prepared as described earlier (23Nakamura M.

The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% H2O2.The sections were stained with primary antibody against CK14 and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA), 1:40 dilution, for 30 min at room temperature. The sections were sequentially stained with the primary antibody against recombinant mouse amelogenin for 1 h and then incubated with the secondary antibody coupled with tetramethylrhodamin isothiocyanate (TRITC) to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, pA), 1:40 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. Replacing the primary antibody with Tris-buffered saline and also IgG isotypes performed as negative controls. Sections were then washed, mounted immediately with glycerol (95% glycerol with 5% phosphate buffer as mounting media), and examined with a Zeiss Laser Scan Microscope (LSM 510) (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 514λ argon and a 543λ helium-neon laser. To determine coassembly of CK14 and amelogenin in vivo, co-localization was studied on sections stained sequentially with FITC-conjugated antibody for CK14 (green signal at 514) and TRITC-conjugated antibody for amelogenin (red signal at 543) (25Leenders G.V.

Both lines pass through a dichroic mirror and a neutral density filter before passing through the cell. The emitted light reflected from the sample and fluorescence was collected by an oil immersion lens and imaged on to a photomultiplier tube after passing through a confocal aperture at an optical filter. The cells were scanned at 4 s/frame and averaged twice to reduce background noise. The laser power was adjusted to ensure any photodynamic effect on the cells was negligible. Sections from mouse mandibular tooth organs (PN day 5) were treated with lectins before and after treatment with sialidase. The following lectins were used; Triticum vulgaris (wheat germ agglutinin) that binds to sialic acid and GlcNAc (29Peters B.P. Ebisu S. Goldstein I.J. Flashner M. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5505-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol.

Goldstein I.J. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1602-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were treated with neuraminidase to rule out the staining due to sialic acids.Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase (type X) (purchased from Sigma) was used in all the major experiments. The enzyme treatments were done as described elsewhere (10Ravindranath R.M.H. Moradian-Oldak J. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2464-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 22Ravindranath R.M.H. Graves M.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5430-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sections were overlaid with 200 milliunits of enzyme in 200 μl of PBS/section and were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, the sections were treated with lectin peroxidase-coupled wheat germ agglutinin or biotinylated D. stramomium (1 mg/ml, 1:10). Sections from mouse mandibular tooth organs (saggital sections, 6 μm) were used to assess the localization of free CK14 or free amelogenins in ameloblasts during enamel formation. Sections were treated with 50 milliunits ofN-acetylglucosaminidase (Sigma) (22Ravindranath R.M.H. Graves M.C. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5430-5440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to assess the location of free CK14 in ameloblasts. The sections were blocked with PBS (pH 6.0) with 1.0% HSA at 37 °C for 1 h and then incubated with [3H]ATMP or 3H-labeled GMp for 2 h at 37 °C to identify free CK14 or amelogenins. After washing the slides 3 times with PBS (0.1% HSA, pH 6.0), the slides were dried for 30 min at room temperature. Each slide was dipped separately in emulsion fluid diluted in water at 1:1 dilution (Kodak Autoradiography Emulsions, Type NTB2 for β emitters, International Biotech Inc. Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) in the dark for 1 min, dried, and stored at 4 °C. The autoradiographs were developed in Kodak DEKTOL Developer (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) according to the manufacturers recommendations and counterstained with hematoxylin. Digital and phase contrast microscopy was used to identify the grains on sections. The scatter diagram (co-localization) is created and analyzed for pixel distribution (27Lacoste T.D. Michalet X. Pinaud F. Chemla D.S. Alivisatos A.P. Weiss S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9461-9466Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All pixels having the same positions in both images are considered a pair. Of every pair of pixels (P1, P2) from the two images, the brightness level of pixel P1 is interpreted as theX coordinate, and that of pixel P2 as the Ycoordinate of the scatter diagram. Non-co-localized P1 and P2 pixels and the background values were excluded to distinguish the pixels that are co-localized. The results were expressed as percentage of co-localization of amelogenins and CK14 at different developmental stages from day 0 to 9 from initiation, growth, and cessation (double-headed arrow) of enamel formation. The quantity of non-co-localized P1 and P2 pixels representing free amelogenin and free CK14, respectively, are also plotted for comparison. Recombinant amelogenin (rM179) is a 20.16-kDa polypeptide with 179 amino acids. It differs from native amelogenin only in the absence of the N-terminal methionine and that serine at position 16 is not phosphorylated. The ATMP sequence that interacts with CK14 is localized in the C-terminal region of TRAP. It binds to GlcNAc as well as the GMp localized in the N-terminal head region of CK14. The specific binding of ATMP-GMp was confirmed earlier (11Ravindranath R.M.H. Tam W. Nguyen P. Fincham A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39654-39661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Solid matrix immunoassay analysis of the interaction between CK14 and amelogenins showed dosimetric binding of recombinant M179 to CK14 (Fig.1A).

Similar proteins that interact with the yeast homolog of the 70K protein, Snp1p, have yet to be identified. We used the two-hybrid system to find fourU1-Snp1 associating (Usa) proteins. Two of these proteins physically associate with Snp1p as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation. One is Prp8p, a known, essential spliceosomal component. This interaction suggests some novel functions for Snp1p and the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein late in spliceosome development. The other, Exo84p, is a conserved subunit of the exocyst, an eight-protein complex functioning in secretion. We show here that Exo84p is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing. A temperature-sensitive exo84 mutation caused increased ratios of pre-mRNA to mRNA for the Rpl30 and actin transcripts in cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature. The mutation also led to a defect in splicing and prespliceosome formation in vitro; an indication that Exo84p has a direct role in splicing.

It must be bound to pre-mRNA for subsequent stable association of the other four spliceosomal snRNPs with the pre-mRNA. Once U1 snRNP is bound, U2 snRNP binds, and the prespliceosome is formed. The tri-snRNP complex, U4/U6.U5, then binds to form the spliceosome. The spliceosome next undergoes a number of coordinated rearrangements (4Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The duplexes between the U4 and U6 snRNAs and between U1 snRNA and the 5′-splice site (SS) of the pre-mRNA are disrupted, whereas new pairings between U2 and U6 snRNAs, U6 snRNA and the 5′-SS, and U5 snRNA and the pre-mRNA exons 1 and 2 are formed. These rearrangements lead to the formation of the active catalytic site of the spliceosome. Splicing of the pre-mRNA then ensues by two transesterification reactions. The yeast U1 snRNP recognizes both the 5′-SS and the branchpoint region of the pre-mRNA (3Rosbash M. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Ruby S.W. Abelson J. Science. 1988; 242: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). From 5 to 7 nucleotides of the 5′ end of the U1 snRNA base pair with the 5′-SS of the pre-mRNA to form the short U1/5′-SS duplex (3Rosbash M. Seraphin B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 187-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Additionally eight proteins of the U1 snRNP, including the C and Snp1p proteins, contact the 5′-SS region and exon 1 and may stabilize the U1/5′-SS duplex (6Zhang D. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Proteins bound to the pre-mRNAs branchpoint region associate with at least one protein component of the yeast U1 snRNP, Prp40p, to form a bridge to the 5′-SS (7Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Similar protein-protein interactions suggest such a protein bridge in metazoans as well (8Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). During spliceosome formation, the 5′-SS switches its pairing from the U1 to the U6 snRNA (4Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). It is not understood when and how the U1 snRNP is displaced from the 5′-SS. It was first suggested that the U1 snRNP physically dissociates from the developing spliceosome before the tri-snRNP binds, but it is now thought that the displacement occurs when the tri-snRNP enters the spliceosome or shortly thereafter (9Ruby S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17333-17341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Kuhn A.N. Brow D.A. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 3: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). One of the DEAD box helicases, Prp28p, may eliminate the U1/5′-SS pairing by unwinding the duplex, by promoting the pairing of U6 with the 5′-SS to displace U1, or by altering C protein binding to destabilize the U1/5′-SS duplex (11Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 12Chen J.Y.-F. Stands L. Staley J.P. Jackups Jr., R.R. Latus L.J. Chang T.-H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 227-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In metazoans, the U1 snRNP also functions in regulating both constitutive and alternative splicing. An element of the U1 snRNP important in this function is the 70K protein that interacts with a number of factors. The 70K protein binds to stem-loop 1 of the U1 snRNA via an RNA recognition motif in its central domain. Its N-terminal domain interacts with the U1 C protein to help stabilize the U1/5′-SS duplex (13Heinrichs V. Bach M. Winkelmann G. Luhrmann R. Science. 1990; 247: 69-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Its C-terminal domain associates with the SR protein, ASF/SF2 (14Cao W. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20629-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and additional SR proteins (8Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 15Romac J.M.-J. Keene J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1400-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Zhang W.J. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 676-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SR proteins, so-called because they contain serine-arginine dipeptide repeats, enhance or repress splicing by recruiting or inhibiting other splicing factors, especially the U1 and U2 snRNPs (17Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tacke R. Manley J.L. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 59-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some SR proteins along with 70K form the protein bridge between the 5′-SS and the branchpoint region (8Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Several interactions between the SR proteins and 70K are regulated by phosphorylation (14Cao W. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20629-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 19Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and several steps in the splicing pathway, including spliceosome assembly, depend on the phosphorylated state of these proteins (20Misteli T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R198-R200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both the SR (17Fu X.-D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 21Manley J. Tacke R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) proteins are targets of specific kinases. We considered that Snp1p (23Smith V. Barrell B.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the yeast homolog of the 70K protein, might also physically associate with proteins that regulate splicing in yeast. Like the 70K protein with which it shares 30% identity, Snp1p has three domains (23Smith V. Barrell B.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Hilleren P. Siliciano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), with the central domain binding via an RNA recognition motif to the U1 snRNA (25Kao H.-Y. Siliciano P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4009-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Snp1p is not required for viability in all yeast strains (23Smith V. Barrell B.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Hilleren P. Siliciano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but it is required for efficient splicing (24Hilleren P. Siliciano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6341-6350Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a phenotype suggestive of a regulatory role. Unlike metazoans that have large numbers of SR proteins, yeast may have only a few such proteins. In this study we used the yeast two-hybrid system (26Fields S. Sternglanz R. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 286-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) to screen yeast sequences for those encoding U1 Snp1passociating (Usa) proteins. We found four Usa proteins. One of these is Prp8p, a known, integral component of the U5 snRNP (27Newman A.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another, Usa3p, has also been identified as Exo84p, a component of the evolutionarily conserved exocyst complex of the secretory pathway (28Guo W. Grant A. Novick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23558-23564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our characterization of a Ts exo84 mutant indicates that Exo84p in vivo affects the expression of some genes with introns and in vitro has a direct role in splicing. Both interactions, Snp1p-Prp8p and Snp1p-Exo84p, may be involved in splicing regulation. The Snp1p-Prp8p interaction may be important in coordinating the 5′-SS switch from U1 to U6. The Snp1p-Exo84p interaction may be involved in comodulating secretion and pre-mRNA splicing. Intriguingly, Exo84p has two copies of the consensus target site for an SR protein kinase.

Anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5, originally from Babco, Inc., was a gift from V. Lundblad. Anti-Gal4p and anti-Bcy1p polyclonal antibodies were gifts from J. Hopper and M. Werner-Washburne, respectively. Standard yeast genetic methods (29Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-933PubMed Google Scholar) and media (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) were as described. Plasmids were introduced by either transformation with PEG (31Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar) or by electroporation (32Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). When plasmids were introduced by targeted integration (33Rothstein R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), the site of integration was subsequently confirmed by Southern analysis. For selecting bacterial isolates with aLEU2-marked plasmid, we used M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mm thiamine HCl, 100 mg/ml thymidine, 100 mg/ml ampicillin, and the yeast amino acid mix lacking leucine (30Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The oligos were synthesized by Genosys, Inc., or the University of New Mexico Center for Genetics in Medicine. Their sequences are available upon request.

The pGADF library of Gal4p activation domain fusions (YL4000AF) was made byCLONTECH from Sau3AI-cut, SFY526 genomic DNA inserted into the BamHI site of three plasmids, pGAD1F, pGAD2F, and pGAD3F (39Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The pRS300 and pRS400 series of yeast shuttle vectors (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1990; 122: 19-27Crossref Google Scholar), integrating vector Yiplac211 (41Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2528) Google Scholar), and plasmids pJJ215, pJJ282, and pJJ283 (42Jones J.S. Prakash L. Yeast. 1990; 6: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were as described previously. Plasmids were constructed with standard cloning techniques, PCR amplification (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of single strand DNA (44Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). For some plasmid constructions, DNA ends with 5′ overhangs were “blunted” by filling in the overhangs with Klenow. Constructions involving PCR, mutagenesis, or the insertion of oligos were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The 1.8-kbp SmaI-HincII fragment from pJJ215 was ligated into the blunted StyI sites of plasmid pDi thereby replacing the 500-bp SNP1 fragment to generate plasmid pPS4 (snp1::HIS3). For constructing pGBT9-SNP1, BamHI andEcoRI sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the SNP1 ORF by PCR using oligos oSR37 and oSR38 and template plasmid pRS3D. The amplified fragment was cut withBamHI and EcoRI restriction endonucleases and then ligated into pGBT9 immediately downstream of the Gal4 DNA binding domain codons 1–147. The SNP1 BamHI-EcoRI insert was subcloned from pGBT9 into pGAD424 (pGAD-SNP1) and pMA424 (pMA424-SNP1) downstream of the GAL4 activation domain. For in vitro expression of FLAG-tagged Snp1p, uniqueBglII and HindIIII sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the SNP1 ORF were introduced by PCR with oligos oSR60 and oSR61 and template plasmid pRS3D. The resulting DNA fragment was cut with BglII and HindIII and then subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGAD424 to create pJD1. Hybridized oligos oSR68 and oSR69 encoding the FLAG-tag were ligated into theXhoI and BamHI sites of pJD1 to create plasmid pSR171. The BglII-BamHI SNP1 fragments from pJD1 and pSR171 were subcloned into the BamHI andBglII sites of pCite2a to generate plasmids pSR174 and pSR175, respectively. The 5.4-kbp SacI-SalIEXO84 genomic DNA fragment from phage λ was subcloned into plasmids pKSII+ and pUC119 to create pCM28 and pCM29, respectively. The Eco47III–SalI fragment containing EXO84 and 610 and 80 bp of its 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences, respectively, was subcloned from pCM29 into pRS316 and pRS313 to create pSA18 (CEN-URA3-EXO84(Eco47III–SalI)) and pSA20 (CEN-HIS3-EXO84(Eco47III–SalI)). Because of the small amount of sequence from the EXO84 stop codon to the SalI site, we subcloned additional 3′-flanking DNA from a wild type yeast strain. For this purpose we constructed the plasmid pSA26 (HIS3-BglII-exo84) containing ∼600 bp of the N terminus of EXO84 with a BglII site just 5′ toEXO84 codon 1. Plasmid pSA26 was target-integrated into genomic DNA at the EXO84 locus. The plasmid pSA31 with 480 bp downstream of the EXO84 translational stop codon was then recovered by cutting the yeast DNA with NcoI, ligating the DNA under dilute conditions to circularize the plasmid DNA, and amplifying the plasmid in Escherichia coli. TheXcmI-NcoI fragment encoding the 3′ end ofEXO84 was subcloned from pSA31 into the XcmI and blunted SalI sites of pSA20 to create pSA35 (CEN-HIS3-EXO84(Eco47III–NcoI)). Similarly, the ClaI-NcoI fragment from pSA31 was subcloned into the ClaI and blunted SalI sites of pSA20 to create pSA36 (CEN-URA3-EXO84(Eco47III–NcoI)). For creating the exo84 null mutation, thePstI-SmaI LEU2 fragment from pJJ282 was inserted into the PstI and blunted EcoRI sites of pCM28 to form pCM32 (exo84::LEU2). For constructing deletion mutations in EXO84 in vitro, a uniqueNcoI site was introduced just 3′ of the translational stop codon by mutagenesis of pSA35 with oligo oSA11 to create pSA45. A unique MluI site just 5′ to the translational start codon was introduced by mutagenesis of pCM29 with oligo oSA10 to create pSA44. DNA fragments containing the 5′ and 3′ mutations were used to replace the corresponding fragments in pCM29 to create pSA46. To create the exo84-2 mutation, codons 636 and 637 were changed from AGA-TCT to AGG-CCT in pSA46 with oligo oSA13 to create a uniqueStuI site in pSA50. The XcmI-NcoI fragment from pSA50 was subcloned into pSA45 to form pSA53. A stop codon immediately after codon 636 was then introduced by ligating hybridized oligos oSA19 and oSA20 into pSA53 DNA cut withStuI and NcoI to create plasmid pSA55. Plasmid pSA57 (CEN-HIS3-exo84-2(Eco47III–NcoI)) was created by subcloning theBsrGI-NcoI fragment from pSA55 into pSA35. For expression of the HA-tagged Exo84p in yeast cells, two copies of the HA tag were inserted at the C-terminal end of Exo84p in three steps as follows. 1) Unique NheI and AflII sites were introduced just before the stop codon by in vitromutagenesis of pSA46 with oligo o46dseM4TAG to create pSA46dse. 2) Hybridized oligos oHA2TAG-a and oHA2TAG-b were inserted into theNheI and AflII sites of pSA46dse to create plasmid pksEXO84HA. 3) The 2-kbp XcmI-NcoI fragment of pksEXO84-HA was subcloned into the corresponding sites of pSA57 generating pEXO84-HA2. For expression of Exo84p in vitro, additional restriction enzyme sites were introduced by ligating hybridized oligos oSA5 and oSA6 into the PstI andBglII sites of pSR165 to create pSA23. TheNspI-SalI EXO84 fragment was subcloned into the NspI and SalI sites of pSA23 to create pSA24 (CEN,LEU2,BglII-EXO84); this encodes EXO84lacking the first 14 codons. The BglII-SalI fragment containing the EXO84 ORF was subcloned from pSA24 in two steps into the corresponding sites of pCite2a to create pSA40; this construction added on the first 32 codons of the pCite2a (fromNcoI to BglII sites) plus one codon (ATC) 5′ to codon 15 of EXO84. The 2.9-kbp,EcoRV-EcoRI, PRP8 fragment from pJDY13 was subcloned into corresponding sites of pCite2a to create pSR190. Hybridized oligos oSR95 and oSR96 encoding two copies of the HA tag were ligated into the NotI and XhoI sites of pSR190 to generate pSR207. For generating the leu2d595allele, the blunted ends of the 3.9-kbpBglII-BamHI HisG-URA3-HISG fragment from pNK1009 were ligated to the EcoRV and bluntedClaI sites of pJJ283 to generate plasmids pPS9a and pPS9b. Yeast strains HF7c (MAT a , ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, LYS2::GAL1-HIS3, URA::GAL4 17-CYC1-lacZ) and SFY526 (MAT a , ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-38, URA::GAL1-lacZ) were obtained fromCLONTECH and S. Fields, respectively. Bacterial strains DH10B (F−, mcrA Δ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC)Φ80dlacZDM15, Δ lacX74,deoR, recA1, endA1,araD139,Δ(ara, leu)7697,galU, galK, λ-, rpsL,nupG) and BA-1 (thr1, leuB6,thi1, thyA, trpC1117,hsrK−, hsmK−,strr, hisB, tet r) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and A. Murray, respectively. Wild type haploid yeast strains SRYwt-g and SRYwt-h with the leu2d595mutation were generated from strains SRYwt-a and SRYwt-d (45Ruby S.W. Chang T.H. Abelson J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1909-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) by 1) targeted integration of the SalI, HisG-URA3-HisGDNA fragment from pPS9, and 2) selection on 5′-FOA for recombinants that had lost URA3 marker from the integrated fragment. Haploids SRYwt-g and SRYwt-h were mated to create DSR1515 (Mat a/α, his3d200/his3d200, HIS7/his7, leu2d595/leu2d595, ura3-52/ura3-52). TSR432(MAT a/a , SNP1/snp1::HIS3, his3d200/his3d200, HIS7/his7, ura3-52/ura3-52, leu2d595/leu2d595) was generated from DRS1515 by targeted integration of the EcoRV-SphI (snp1::HIS3) DNA fragment from plasmid pPS4. For testing the function and expression of theGAL4-SNP1 fusion, TSR432 was then transformed with plasmid pGAD-SNP1, and the resulting diploid, DRP432-8, was sporulated. Dissected tetrads from sporulated diploids TSR432 and DRP432-8 were analyzed for germination and growth on medium with glucose. No snp1::HIS3 spores from 16 TSR432 tetrads were viable, but mostsnp1::HIS3, pGAD-SNP1 spores from 12 DRP432-8 tetrads were viable. Diploid TSR995-10, heterozygous for theexo84::LEU2 null mutation, was created from strain DSR1515 by targeted integration of theEco47III-SalI DNA fragment from pCM32. Tetrad analyses of the sporulated diploid TSR995-10 showed theEXO84 gene to be essential; only two viable spores per tetrad were recovered in the 16 tetrads dissected, and none of these spores were Leu+. However, when plasmid pSA36 (pCEN-URA3-EXO84(Eco47III-NcoI)) was introduced into TSR995-10, and the resulting transformant TSR1131 was sporulated and analyzed, viable LEU2 URA3 spore clones were obtained. Furthermore, these viable TSR1131 spore clones required the plasmid pSA36 for growth as evidenced by the fact that 5-FOA-resistant clones were not obtained. TSR995-10 was also transformed with plasmid pSA18 to create strain TSR1028, sporulated, and dissected to generate haploid TSR1028-2-13A (Matα, his3d200, leu2d595, ura3-52, exo84::LEU2, pSA18). Diploid DSR1624 was created by mating TSR1028-2-13A with wild type DSR1124-2-4D (Mat a , cup1d, leu2-3 -112, his3d200, trp1d, ura3-52). Haploid DSR1624-2-11B (Mat a , cup1d, his3d200, leu2d595, trp1d, exo84::LEU2, pSA18) was obtained by tetrad dissection. Strains TSR1200, TSR1210, and TSR1280 were obtained by transforming haploid DSR1624-2-11B with plasmids pSA55, pSA35, and pEXO84-HA2, respectively, and by subsequent selection on 5-FOA at 30 °C. HF7c cells were transformed with the pGBT9-Snp1p to obtain the strain TSR385-1. The pGAD library was then introduced into TSR385-1 by electroporation as described (32Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) except that 0.5 µg of single-strand salmon sperm DNA (average molecular mass of 300 nucleotides) and 1–2 µg of library DNA were added to 400 µl of electrocompetent cells. Transformants were selected by growth on medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and supplemented with 1 msorbitol and either 0, 5, or 20 mm 3-AT. The prototrophs obtained were further screened, if necessary, by replica plating onto synthetic medium containing 5 or 20 mm 3-AT. His+ prototrophs which grew in the presence of 20 mm 3-AT were replica-plated onto medium supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to detect β-galactosidase activity. The His+,lacZ+ candidate transformants were then grown in liquid selective media at 30 °C to midlog phase and assayed quantitatively for β-galactosidase activity by the glass bead method (46Ruby S.W. Szostak J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Units of activity were calculated as units = (A 420 × 1000)/(min ×A 600 assayed). We obtained 24 candidates with β-galactosidase activities of 0.35 units and above. The pGADf library plasmids from these 24 yeast candidates were recovered from total yeast DNA by electroporation into E. coli BA-1 cells. Transformed bacterial cells were first selected on LB medium with 100 mg/ml ampicillin and then replica-plated onto M9 medium lacking leucine to detect LEU2-marked pGAD-library plasmids. The LEU2-marked plasmids were then amplified inE. coli DH10B cells and sequenced with Primer 1 (CLONTECH, Inc.). Deduced protein sequences were compared using BLAST, FASTA, and TFAST algorithms (47Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar, 48Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar, 49Genetics Computer Group (1999) Wisconsin Package, version 10, Madison, WI.Google Scholar). The recovered plasmids were then electroporated into strain TSR592-2 (strain SFY526 with the bait plasmid pMA424-BD-SNP1) and tested again for transcription activation via quantitative β-galactosidase assays. The combination of the strain (SFY526) and vector (pMA424) often gives higher β-galactosidase activities than the strain (HF7C) and vector (pGBT9) used in the initial screen (50Legrain P. Dokhelar M.C. Transy C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3241-3242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The following plasmids were cut with restriction endonucleases to produce linear templates for in vitro transcription: pSR174 and pSR175 with SphI; pSA40 with SalI; and pSR190 and pSR207 with XhoI. The templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and then treated with RQ1 DNase. The RNAs were purified from the reactions by phenol and CHCl3/isoamyl alcohol extractions and by ethanol precipitation after which they were dissolved in water and stored at −70 °C. RNAs were added toin vitro translation reactions with [35S]methionine and micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to Promega's conditions (1992 bulletin TM232). After the reactions were incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C, they were treated with RNase A for 30 min. In vitrotranslation products were separated by SDS-PAGE (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and visualized by fluorography and autoradiography. In vitro translations for coimmunoprecipitation experiments were combined, supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 mg/ml chymostatin, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 7.2 mg/mltrans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino) butane, and 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The total volume was brought up to 250 µl with ice-cold NET-2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and added to either anti-FLAG M2-agarose, anti-HA 16B12-agarose, or the control protein G-agarose. The samples were slowly rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose was then washed 4 times with NET-2. Proteins were released from the agarose by heating at 95 °C for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol, separated"
https://openalex.org/W2075060333,"Radiation-induced intestinal fibrosis is characterized by collagen accumulation, a process in which TGF-beta1 plays a key role. We analyzed the effects of gamma radiation on collagen expression and TGF-beta1 distribution in human intestinal smooth muscle cells (HISM). We investigated the activity of a carboxymethylated and sulfated dextran (RG-1503), exhibiting antifibrotic properties and promoting in vivo intestinal tissue repair, on irradiated HISM. After (60)Co irradiation (10 Gy), HISM were labeled with [(3)H] proline (+/-RG-1503). Radiolabeled collagen I, III, and V were quantified by SDS-PAGE. TGF-beta1 was quantified by ELISA in culture medium, pericellular and intracellular compartments. Irradiation induced a specific 2.85-fold increase in collagen III production by HISM. Collagen V decreased by 80% 72 h after irradiation. Pericellular TGF-beta1 was increased (up to twofold) in irradiated HISM. RG-1503 added before or after irradiation reversed both mRNA and protein levels of collagen III and V to control values. RG-1503 decreased the amount of TGF-beta1 in the cell layer below the control values. Irradiation of HISM induced the development of a fibrotic phenotype in terms of collagen production and TGF-beta1 distribution. The antifibrotic RG-1503 restored HISM physiological characteristics and may represent a promising therapeutic approach for radiation-induced intestinal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2035338405,"The receptor activator of NF-κB ligand induces the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and transcription factor, PU.1-interacting protein (Pip), during osteoclastogenesis. In this paper, we have examined the role of transcription factors in the regulation of TRAPgene expression employing reporter constructs containing the promoter region of TRAP gene. Transient transfection of RAW264 cells with sequential 5′-deletions of mouse TRAP gene promoter-luciferase fusion constructs indicated that at least two sites are required for the full promoter activity. Deletion and site-directed mutation studies revealed that M-box and interferon regulatory factor element sites are critical for TPAP gene expression in the cell, suggesting that microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and Pip could induce the gene expression independently. Moreover, the overexpression of MITF and Pip functionally stimulated TRAPpromoter activity in a synergistic manner. Analysis of the deletion mutants of Pip protein indicated that both N-terminal DNA-binding and C-terminal regulatory domains are indispensable to the promoter-enhancing activity. Subcellular localization of green fluorescence protein-fused Pip and its mutant proteins indicated that the C-terminal domain is required for the translocation of Pip into the nucleus. These results suggest that Pip regulates and acts synergistically with MITF to induce the promoter activity ofTRAP gene.

Soluble RANKL can induce osteoclastogenesis both in vivo and in the absence of stromal cells in vitro. Moreover, it has been shown that mutant mice with eitherRANKL or its receptor RANK gene disrupted exhibit severe osteopetrosis and osteoclast defects, indicating that RANKL plays an essential role in osteoclast differentiation (14Kong Y.Y.

Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K are osteoclast marker proteins that are expressed in functionally maturated osteoclasts. Disruption of the genes encoding these marker proteins in mice results in osteopetrosis (16Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M.

The importance of gene regulation of these proteins in the functional maturation of osteoclasts is also suggested by the fact that osteopetrosis results after knockout in mice of genes encoding transcription factors such as c-Fos, PU.1, or NF-κB (p50 and p52 double knockout mice) (18Grigoriadis A.E.

In our previous work, we showed that RANKL induced the differentiation of both primary murine bone marrow cells and the murine monocytic cell line, RAW264 cells, into TRAP-positive osteoclast-like multinucleated cells through activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (22Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It has been shown that mice with theTRAP gene disrupted exhibit mild osteopetrosis, although multinucleated osteoclasts are still observed (16Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) regulatesTRAP gene expression (23Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that MITF is expressed in osteoclast progenitors and that its presence facilitates osteoclastogenesis (24Kawaguchi N. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In fact, microphthalmia mutant (mi/mi) mice expressing a dominant negative form of MITF exhibit defects in osteoclastogenesis and osteopetrosis (25Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). However, because osteoclasts obtained from tg/tgmice, Mi null mutant mice, are normal (25Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), it appears that MITF is not essential for osteoclast differentiation and its resorptional function. These results, together with the fact that there are several transcription binding sites in the promoter region ofTRAP gene, have prompted us to analyze the mechanisms ofTRAP gene expression during RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and maturation. The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors possesses multifunctional biological activities including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and antiviral activity (26Taniguchi T.

Among the nine homologues so far identified, PU.1-interacting protein (Pip), also termed IRF-4, lymphoid-specific IRF, or interferon consensus sequence-binding protein in adult T-cell leukemia cell lines or activated T cells (ICSAT), has been shown to be essential for lymphoid cell development (30Brass A.L.

Our results reported in this paper indicate for the first time that Pip is increased in osteoclast-like cells that differentiated from RANKL-treated cells of macrophage lineage and can regulate TRAP gene expression. Moreover, Pip and MITF synergistically induce the increase in TRAP gene expression, suggesting that transactivation of both M-box and IRF-E sites is required for maximum induction of the gene expression. Human recombinant soluble RANKL (sRANKL) was purchased from Peprotec EC Ltd. (London, UK). Polyclonal antibody against Pip/IRF-4 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression vector, pEGFPC1, was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). pSRα human ICSAT (IRF-4) cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. T. Yamagata of University of Tokyo. The mouse RAW264 cells (RIKEN, RCB0535) were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), and 1% non-essential amino acids as described previously (22Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). After 3 or 5 day, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to Western blot analysis. The HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 µg/ml kanamycin. The pcDNA3FLAG-Pip (FLPip) and pcDNA3 PU.1 plasmids were kind gifts from Dr. H. Sighn (Harvard Medical School). A genomic clone encoding the 5′-flanking region of theTRAP gene, TBX6, was a kind gift from Dr.G. D. Roodman (University of Texas, Health Science Center). The fragments of the sequentially deleted sequence from −1492, −1294, −217, or −193 to +1 of the TRAP gene promoter were amplified by PCR using specific primers and TBX6 as a template. These fragments were then subcloned into the XhoI/HindIII sites of the pGL3 basic vector containing the luciferase reporter gene (Promega, Madison, WI). The MITF expression plasmid, pcDNAFLAG-MITF was made by PCR amplification from the pEF-BOS-MITF using the following primers, 5′-GCTCTAGACGCCACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGATGCTGGAAATGCTAGAATA-3′ (sense), 5′-CCGGAATTCCTAACACGCATGCTCCGTTTCTTC-3′ (antisense), and then ligated into the pcDNA3.1(−) vector in-frame. A full-length FLAG-MITF cDNA was confirmed by sequencing. Mutagenesis of M-box or IRF-E site of p-1492TRAPLuc plasmid was performed using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The oligonucleotides (and their complementary strands) used for making mutations in the M-box is 5′-GTCCAGTGctcgag(XhoI site)ACCAAGGGGAG-3′ and for the IRF-E site 5′-CTCAGACTTTCTgggccc(ApaI site)ATTTTTCAAACTTCCCA-3′. Expression plasmids for the Pip deletion mutant, PipΔN, which lacks the sequence between amino acids 39 and 117 was constructed by digestion of pcDNA3FLAG-Pip with SmaI andEcoRV and then ligated. As for PipΔC lacking amino acids between 378 and 408, the pcDNA3FLAG-Pip vector was digested with HindIII andNheI, and then the fragment containing pcDNA3 vector and the C-terminal region corresponding to amino acid residues 409–451 was obtained. A fragment containing Pip (1) and the hemagglutinin tag region was amplified by PCR using T7 primer and a specific primer, 5′-CGGTGCTAGCCGGCCATGGTGAGCAAAC-3′, and then digested withHindIII and NheI. The FLAG-Pip fragment was inserted into the HindIII and NheI sites of pcDNA3 vector containing the C-terminal region of Pip. Total RNAs for cDNA synthesis were isolated from murine bone marrow and RAW264 cells as described (34Yamano Y. Matsumoto M. Sasahara K. Sakamoto E. Morishima I. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mmdNTPs, 1 µg of oligo(dT) primers, and the supplied buffer. RT-PCR assays were carried out using the following primer pairs for TRAP, Cathepsin K, RANK (35Arai F. Miyamoto T. Ohneda O. Inada T. Sudo T. Brasel K. Miyata T. Anderson D.M. Suda T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1741-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), c-Fos (Stratagene), and β-actin (36Matsumoto M. Tanaka N. Harada H. Kimura T. Yokochi T. Kitagawa M. Schindler C. Taniguchi T. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) as described: TRAP, 5′-CAATGACAAGAGGTTCCAGGAGACCT-3′ (sense), 5′-ACAGGTAGGCGGTGACCCCGTATG-3′ (antisense); and Cathepsin K, 5′-TGGATGAAATCTCTCGGCGT-3′ (sense), 5′-TCATGTCTCCCAAGTGGTTC-3′ (antisense). PCRs for TRAP, RANK, andβ-actinwere carried out for 1 cycle at 95 °C for 9 min, followed by 25, 30, or 35 cycles at 94 °C for 0.5 min, at 54 °C for 1 min, and at 72 °C for 1 min. mRNA levels were quantified by a software program of imaging analyzer, NIH Image 1.61. The relative amount of the TRAP mRNAs were normalized to that of β-actin mRNA. For transfection of reporter plasmids, RAW264 cells or HEK 293 cells were plated on 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well on the day before transfection. A total of 6.3 µg of plasmid DNA was mixed with Superfect (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) and transfected into the cells following the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was then measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate, averaged, and then normalized to β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using ao-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (37Takaoka A. Mitani Y. Suemori H. Sato M. Yokochi T. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T. Science. 2000; 288: 2357-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Whole cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts (30 µg) were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblot detection was performed with the corresponding goat antiserum using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantitative analysis of Pip protein expression level was performed by using a software program of imaging analyzer, NIH Image 1.61 cDNA encoding intact or mutant Pip was ligated in-frame into HindIII/BamHI sites of pEGFPC1 (pEGFP-Pip, -PipΔN, or -PipΔC). To assess the intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins, the expression plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells. After incubation, the medium was removed and replaced with phosphate-buffered saline. Then the cells were visualized by using a fluorescence microscope equipped with the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Initially, we examined the effects of RANKL on the expression of osteoclast-specificTRAP mRNA in a murine monocytic cell line, RAW264 cells. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to estimate the relative expression levels of the TRAP gene. As shown in Fig.1, incubation of RAW264 cells with RANKL increased the expression level of TRAP mRNA within 3 days. In contrast, RANKL had no significant effect on the expression levels of mRNAs for c-fos, RANK, andβ-actinup to 5 days. Densitometric analysis indicated an 8-fold increase in the expression level of TRAP mRNA during the incubation period. Similar results were obtained employing murine bone marrow cells treated with RANKL and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (data not shown). We also analyzed another osteoclast specific gene, cathepsin K, and found that RANKL increased the expression of its mRNA level by 25-fold. These results suggest that RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis is associated with its ability to induce osteoclast-specific gene expression. Several potential DNA-binding elements such as AP-1, M-box, PU.1, and IRF-E were detected in the 5′-upstream region of the gene (34Yamano Y. Matsumoto M. Sasahara K. Sakamoto E. Morishima I. Biosci.

Res. 1993; 8: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Among the transcription factors possibly included in the regulation of TRAP gene, we focused on Pip because it is expressed in macrophages as well as lymphoid cells and can form a complex as well as act synergistically with PU.1 (30Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 39Rosenbauer F. Waring J.F. Foerster J. Wietstruk M. Philipp D. Horak I. Blood. 1999; 94: 4274-4281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was shown that the disruption of thePU.1 gene caused the depletion of cells of macrophage/monocyte lineage and induced osteopetrosis in mice, suggesting a critical role for PU.1 and its binding protein, Pip, in osteoclastogenesis. To examine whether or not RANKL affected the expression level of Pip protein, RAW264 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of RANKL. Although increase in the Pip protein expression level was observed in control cells at day 3, it returned to the basal level at day 5 (Fig.2A). When compared with control cells, an increase in the expression level was observed in cells treated with RANKL. Quantitative analysis indicated that RANKL caused 2.0- and 8.5-fold increases at days 3 and 5, respectively, indicating that RANKL indeed induced the increase in the expression level of Pip protein. We also examined the effect of RANKL on the expression of other IRF family proteins (i.e., IRF-1, 3, 5, 7). In contrast to Pip/IRF-4, RANKL had little effect on these proteins (data not shown). To elucidate the role of Pip in the regulation ofTRAP gene expression, chimeric reporter plasmids encoding the luciferase gene and different lengths of the TRAP gene promoter region were constructed and transfected into RAW264 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, RANKL induced the increase in the expression of luciferase activity in cells transfected with either p-1492TRAPLuc or p-1294TRAPLuc. When p-217TRAPLuc was transfected, a decrease in the RANKL-induced enzyme activity was observed. After deletion of the IRF-E site, RANKL exhibited no enhancing activity. These results suggest that at least two factors (i.e., transcription factors binding to M-box and IRF-E sites) are required for the maximum expression of the TRAPgene induced by RANKL. Because Pip could bind to an IRF-E site (33Yamagata T. Nishida J. Tanaka S. Sakai R. Mitani K. Yoshida M. Taniguchi T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), promoter-reporter constructs were transfected with or without the Pip expression vector, pcDNA3FLAG-Pip, into RAW264 cells (Fig.4). Upon transfection with each chimeric construct alone, marginal luciferase activity was detected. On the other hand, co-transfection of pcDNA3FLAG-Pip with promoter-reporter constructs that contained the sequence from −217 to +1 of the TPAP gene promoter region (i.e., p-1492TRAPLuc, p-1294TRAPLuc, and p-217TRAPLuc) caused an ∼4-fold increase in luciferase activity. No increase in enzyme activity was detected by the co-transfection of pcDNA3FLAG-Pip and p-193TRAPLuc. These results suggest that by binding to the IRF-E site and not the PU.1 site, Pip plays a role in the regulation ofTRAP gene expression. Fig. 5A shows the effects of various transcription factors on the expression of luciferase activity of co-transfected p-1492TRAPLuc. Pip protein induced an ∼5-fold increase in luciferase activity. MITF, which has been shown to regulateTRAP gene expression by binding to the M-box site (23Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), also induced an ∼4-fold increase in enzyme activity. The transfection of pSRα c-Fos had no effect on the gene expression. Remarkably, a synergistic increase in enzyme activity was observed after co-transfection of pcDNA3FLAG-Pip and pcDNA3.1(−)FLAG-MITF, suggesting that transactivations of the M-box site and the IRF-E site caused the synergistic activation of TRAP gene promoter activity. Similar results were also obtained by the transfection of pSRα human ICSAT (IRF-4) cDNA expression vector. To identify the promoter region(s) mediating the synergistic action between Pip and MITF, these transcription factors were expressed in RAW264 cells transfected with various chimeric constructs. As shown in Fig. 5 B, synergistic action was observed in cells expressing either p-1492TRAPLuc or p-1294TRAPLuc. Cells expressing p-217TRAPLuc, of which the M-box site was deleted, did not show any synergistic action. Because Pip had no effect on the expression of luciferase activity in cells expressing p-193TRAPLuc, these results further suggest the critical roles of the transactivations of the M-box and IRF-E sites in TRAP gene expression. To confirm the significance of these two sites, we constructed mutant plasmids containing the sequence from −1492 to +1 of theTRAP gene promoter region and mutated sites. As shown in Fig. 5 C, promoter activity in RAW264 cells was reduced sharply when the IRF-E site alone was changed from 5′-TTTCTGTTTCCATTT-3′ to 5′-TTTCTGGGGCCCATTT-3′. Mutation of the M-box site from 5′-CTCACATGAC-3′ to 5′-CTCTCGAGAC-3′ also caused a decrease in promoter activity. Importantly, mutant plasmid having mutations in both M-box and IRF-E sites had no promoter-enhancing activity. These results indicate that Pip and MITF can induce TRAP gene expression independently and that synergistic enhancement of the gene expression is mediated by the interaction between them. To determine the intracellular function of Pip, we first tried electrophoretic mobility shift assay to detect proteins binding to the IRF-E site of theTRAP gene. However, we could not detect any binding activity in nuclear extracts prepared from RAW264 cells treated with or without RANKL (data not shown). In addition, because no anti-Pip antibody affecting the mobility of the complex of Pip and the IRF-E site was available, it was difficult to show the possible involvement of Pip in the regulation of TRAP gene expression by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Next, we examined the effects of transcription factors on the expression of the endogenous TRAP gene. Several combinations of plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and their ability to induce the expression of the gene was examined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, although PU.1 had no effect (data not shown), both Pip and MITF could induce an ∼2-fold increase in gene expression when transfected with the respective expression plasmid alone. A synergistic increase in the endogenous gene expression was observed in cells co-transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-Pip and pcDNA3.1(−)FLAG-MITF. Co-transfection of these plasmids had no effect on the expression of β-actin. These results indicate that Pip and MITF can indeed act synergistically in vivo and further suggest the critical roles of these two transcription factors in the expression of the osteoclast-specific TRAP gene. Because Pip protein contains at least two function domains, a DNA-binding domain and a regulatory domain (30Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we next constructed expression plasmids for Pip having a deletion in either the DNA-binding domain (PipΔN) or the regulatory domain (PipΔC) to analyze the significance of these two domains (Fig. 7A). As shown in Fig. 7 B, whereas intact Pip induced the promoter activity and acted synergistically with MITF, both PipΔN and PipΔC had no effect on the promoter activity, indicating that both DNA-binding and regulatory domains are required for the activity. To verify the significance of these domains, subcellular localization of Pip and its deletion mutants was analyzed. To visualize proteins, we constructed plasmids expressing GFP-fused Pip or mutant proteins and transfected them into HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 7 C, although both GFP-Pip and GFP-PipΔN proteins were found in the nucleus, GFP-PipΔC was localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that the C-terminal regulatory domain is required for the translocation of the protein into the nucleus. In the current study, we examined the mechanism of RANKL-inducedTRAP gene expression. Our data indicate that transactivations of both IRF-E and M-box sites are critical for RANKL-induced TRAP gene expression. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of the possible involvement of Pip/IRF-4 and its functional interaction with MITF in osteoclast development. It is well known that TRAP protein is one of the differentiation markers of osteoclasts (1Ash P. Loutit J.F. Townsend K.M.

Mice lacking the TRAPgene show defective bone resorption activity and have mild osteopetrosis, indicating that TRAP plays an important role in the functional maturation of osteoclasts (16Hayman A.R.

To examine the mechanism of RANKL-induced TRAP gene expression, we employed the murine monocyte cell line, RAW264 cells, because this cell line is known to differentiate into TRAP-positive multinucleated cells when cultured with RANKL alone (22Matsumoto M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As expected, we detected the enhancement of TRAP and cathepsin Kgene expression during RANKL-induced differentiation, indicating that RANKL up-regulated the expression of osteoclast differentiation markers at the transcriptional level. The promoter region of TRAP gene contains several transcription factor-binding sites such as AP-1, PU.1, M-box, and IRF-E. Among them, the M-box binding protein, MITF, was shown to regulate TRAP gene expression during osteoclastogenesis. We demonstrated that the sequence ranging from −1294 to −217 is important for RANKL-induced reporter gene expression. Moreover, mutation of the M-box site caused the loss of MITF-mediated reporter gene expression, thereby confirming the role of MITF in the expression of the TRAP gene during osteoclastogenesis (23Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). More importantly, we found that Pip also induced TRAP gene expression and acted synergistically with MITF. Pip belongs to the IRF family and can bind to the IRF-E site in the promoter region ofTRAP gene. We showed that the expression of Pip protein but not of other IRF family proteins was increased after treatment with RANKL, indicating that Pip might be responsible for the enhancement ofTRAP gene expression in RAW264 cells. Deletion and mutation analyses of reporter constructs revealed that the intact IRF-E site located in the sequence ranging from −217 to −193 was critical for the activity of Pip protein, demonstrating for the first time that transactivation of the IRF-E site was also important forTRAP gene expression. However, at present, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that other Pip-related IRF-E-binding transcription factors also play roles in the regulation ofTRAP gene expression. In this context, HEK 293 cells co-transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-Pip and pcDNA3.1(−)FLAG-MITF show a synergistic increase in the expression of endogenousTRAP mRNA level, supporting the notion that Pip can indeed act synergistically with MITF in vivo. It was shown that mice lacking PU.1 are depleted of cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage and exhibit osteopetrosis, indicating that PU.1 also plays a critical role in osteoclast development (19Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Because the formation of complexes of Pip and PU.1 has been reported (30Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 42Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), it is possible that Pip induces TRAP gene expressionvia the PU.1 site by interacting with PU.1. However, this is unlikely because mutation of the IRF-E site causes total loss of Pip activity. Moreover, although the association of Pip with PU.1 was detected by immunoprecipitation in RAW264 cells co-transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-Pip and pcDNA3PU.1, no enhancement of the reporter gene expression was observed when compared with cells transfected with pcDNA3FLAG-Pip alone (data not shown). In fact, PU.1 had no effect on the expression of endogenous TRAP mRNA in HEK 293 cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that the transactivation of both M-box and IRF-E sites mediates the synergistic enhancement of TRAP gene expression. RANKL-mediated TRAP gene expression may involve to some extent the up-regulation of Pip protein expression. Pip contains at least two functional domains, namely, the N-terminal DNA-binding and C-terminal regulatory domains (30Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Pip binds to the IRF-E site through the DNA-binding domain and functions as a transcription factor. As expected, disruption of this DNA-binding domain led to the loss of transcription-enhancing activity. It has been reported that a predicted α-helix structure in the C-terminal region of Pip is indispensable to its transcription-enhancing activity (30Brass A.L. Zhu A.Q. Singh H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 977-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This structure has been speculated to be important for interactions with other proteins. We have confirmed the importance of this structure by deletion of the C-terminal amino acid sequence from 395 to 413. To further elucidate the role of this structure in the transcripion-enhancing activity, the subcellular localization of Pip and its deletion mutants was examined. Our results indicated that the α-helix structure in the C terminus of Pip is indispensable to its nuclear localization. Without this structure, Pip would be localized in cytosol and therefore could not function as a transcription factor. At present, we speculate that this structure plays the role of interacting with another protein that is responsible for the nuclear transport of the transcription factor. Further work including the identification of the amino acid sequence necessary for the transport of this protein to the nucleus is required to elucidate the mechanism. The disruption of the TRAP gene in mice results in mild osteopetrosis, but multinucleated osteoclasts are still observed in these mutant mice (16Hayman A.R. Jones S.J. Boyde A. Foster D. Colledge W.H. Carlton M.B. Evans M.J. Cox T.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3151-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that TRAP is required for the functional maturation of osteoclasts. Identification of the roles of Pip and MITF in the expression of the TRAP gene may help in understanding the molecular basis of human disorders such as osteoporosis in postmenopausal women or the osteolytic bone destruction and hypercalcemia that occur in patients with multiple myeloma.
