While neonatal vaccination has been hampered by maternal antibody-mediated dampening of immune responses, enhanced regulatory and tolerogenic mechanisms, and immune system immaturity, maternal pre-natal immunization aims to boost neonatal immunity via antibody transfer to the fetus. However, emerging data suggest that antibodies are not transferred equally across the placenta. To understand this, we used systems serology to define Fc features associated with antibody transfer. The Fc-profile of neonatal and maternal antibodies differed, skewed toward natural killer (NK) cell-activating antibodies. This selective transfer was linked to digalactosylated Fc-glycans that selectively bind FcRn and FCGR3A, resulting in transfer of antibodies able to efficiently leverage innate immune cells present at birth. Given emerging data that vaccination may direct antibody glycosylation, our study provides insights for the development of next-generation maternal vaccines designed to elicit antibodies that will most effectively aid neonates.

Vaccines, one of the most impactful public health interventions, have reduced global morbidity and mortality against infectious disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1999Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Impact of vaccines universally recommended for children--United States, 1990-1998.MMWR Morb.

However, vaccines have been less effective at reducing infection-related deaths in newborns (Amenyogbe et al., 2015Amenyogbe N. Levy O. Kollmann T.R. Systems vaccinology: a promise for the young and the poor.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370: 20140340Google Scholar). Compromised vaccine-induced immunity in infants has been attributed to the potentially tolerogenic nature of the neonatal immune system (Yu et al., 2018Yu J.C. Khodadadi H. Malik A. Davidson B. Salles É.D.S.L. Bhatia J. Hale V.L. Baban B. Innate Immunity of Neonates and Infants.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 1759Google Scholar), the reduced functionality of newborn immune cells (Lee and Lin, 2013Lee Y.C. Lin S.J. Neonatal natural killer cell function: relevance to antiviral immune defense.Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2013; 2013: 427696Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2018Yu J.C. Khodadadi H. Malik A. Davidson B. Salles É.D.S.L. Bhatia J. Hale V.L. Baban B. Innate Immunity of Neonates and Infants.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 1759Google Scholar), and dampened immunity from pre-existing maternal antibodies (Saso and Kampmann, 2017Saso A. Kampmann B. Vaccine responses in newborns.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 627-642Google Scholar). Strategies have been proposed to drive more effective immunity in newborns, including designing vaccines and adjuvants tailored to neonates (Saso and Kampmann, 2017Saso A. Kampmann B. Vaccine responses in newborns.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 627-642Google Scholar, Whittaker et al., 2018Whittaker E. Goldblatt D. McIntyre P. Levy O. Neonatal Immunization: Rationale, Current State, and Future Prospects.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 532Google Scholar). Maternal immunization, aimed at enhancing maternal-to-fetal transfer of antibodies, has shown significant promise in boosting newborn immunity (Forsyth et al., 2015Forsyth K. Plotkin S. Tan T. Wirsing von König C.H. Strategies to decrease pertussis transmission to infants.Pediatrics. 2015; 135: e1475-e1482Google Scholar), providing a non-invasive strategy to enhance immunity in this vulnerable population. However, epidemiologic studies focusing on matched mother:fetus pairs have found that the extent of immunity transferred varies significantly by antigen (Fu et al., 2016Fu C. Lu L. Wu H. Shaman J. Cao Y. Fang F. Yang Q. He Q. Yang Z. Wang M.

Dev. Immunol. 2012; 2012: 985646Google Scholar). Specifically, while measles-specific antibodies are transferred efficiently (>100%), antibodies targeting other pathogens, including poliovirus and Coxsackie viruses, are less efficiently transferred (Fu et al., 2016Fu C. Lu L. Wu H. Shaman J. Cao Y. Fang F. Yang Q. He Q. Yang Z. Wang M. Placental antibody transfer efficiency and maternal levels: specific for measles, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, poliomyelitis I-III and HIV-1 antibodies.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38874Google Scholar). The neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, is responsible for receptor-mediated trans-placental transport of IgG (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007Roopenian D.C. Akilesh S. FcRn: the neonatal Fc receptor comes of age.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 715-725Google Scholar). FcRn binds IgG in a pH-dependent manner within acidified endosomes in syncytiotrophoblasts and transits IgG to the interstitial space between the maternal and fetal circulation (Jennewein et al., 2017Jennewein M.F. Abu-Raya B. Jiang Y. Alter G. Marchant A. Transfer of maternal immunity and programming of the newborn immune system.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 605-613Google Scholar, Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007Roopenian D.C. Akilesh S. FcRn: the neonatal Fc receptor comes of age.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 715-725Google Scholar). While FcRn binds to the CH3 domain of all IgG subclasses (Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Google Scholar), differences in IgG subclass transfer have been noted (Einarsdottir et al., 2014Einarsdottir H.K. Stapleton N.M. Scherjon S. Andersen J.T. Rispens T. van der Schoot C.E. Vidarsson G. On the perplexingly low rate of transport of IgG2 across the human placenta.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e108319Google Scholar, Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Google Scholar), including enhanced binding to IgG1 and differential transfer efficiencies of allotypic variants of IgG3 known to bind FcRn with different affinities (Stapleton et al., 2011Stapleton N.M. Andersen J.T. Stemerding A.M. Bjarnarson S.P. Verheul R.C. Gerritsen J. Zhao Y. Kleijer M. Sandlie I. de Haas M. et al.Competition for FcRn-mediated transport gives rise to short half-life of human IgG3 and offers therapeutic potential.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 599Google Scholar, Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Google Scholar). Given that FcRn binding occurs in the CH3 domain, IgG transport, and particularly antigen-specific IgG1 transport, should occur at the same rate. However, a transfer hierarchy exists across antigen-specific antibody subpopulations (Fu et al., 2016Fu C. Lu L. Wu H. Shaman J. Cao Y. Fang F. Yang Q. He Q. Yang Z. Wang M. Placental antibody transfer efficiency and maternal levels: specific for measles, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, poliomyelitis I-III and HIV-1 antibodies.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38874Google Scholar). Thus, other qualitative antibody features are likely to govern differential transfer of particular antibody populations. With the re-emergence of pertussis infections among newborns (Winter et al., 2014Winter K. Glaser C. Watt J. Harriman K. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Pertussis epidemic--California, 2014.MMWR Morb. Mortal. Wkly. Rep. 2014; 63: 1129-1132Google Scholar), efforts have emerged to understand the transfer of pertussis-specific immunity to neonates. Thus, we aimed to dissect the profile of transferred antibodies, focused on defining whether Fc features influence pertussis-specific antibody placental transfer, to help inform maternal vaccine campaigns and next-generation vaccine design. A global, unbiased, and antigen-specific systems serology antibody profiling approach was applied (Chung and Alter, 2017Chung A.W. Alter G. Systems serology: profiling vaccine induced humoral immunity against HIV.Retrovirology. 2017; 14: 57Google Scholar) to deeply and comprehensively define the specific qualitative Fc features of antibodies found in maternal and cord blood on the day of birth. Striking differences were observed in the functional profile of antibodies transferred to neonates, with preferential transfer of natural killer (NK) cell-activating antibodies. This preferential transfer, observed across many antigens, was linked to antigen-specific Fc-glycan profiles on the Fc-domain of antigen-specific antibodies, as well as to enhanced binding to FcRn and FCGR3A, two receptors found to be co-localized on syncytiotrophoblasts. The transfer of FCGR3A-binding, NK cell-activating antibodies coincided with the presence of fully competent NK cells in the cord blood, compared to less competent cord blood neutrophils. These data suggest an evolution of the placenta to selectively transfer antibodies with the most functional potential in the neonatal immune context to better provide protection to neonates. The placenta preferentially transfers IgG antibodies (Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Google Scholar). Although FcRn binds to all IgG subclasses, differences in transfer efficiencies have been noted across the subclasses (IgG1 > 4 > 3 > 2) (Palmeira et al., 2012Palmeira P. Quinello C. Silveira-Lessa A.L. Zago C.A. Carneiro-Sampaio M. IgG placental transfer in healthy and pathological pregnancies.Clin. Dev. Immunol. 2012; 2012: 985646Google Scholar, Vidarsson et al., 2014Vidarsson G. Dekkers G. Rispens T. IgG subclasses and allotypes: from structure to effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2014; 5: 520Google Scholar, Wilcox et al., 2017Wilcox C.R. Holder B. Jones C.E. Factors Affecting the FcRn-Mediated Transplacental Transfer of Antibodies and Implications for Vaccination in Pregnancy.Front. Immunol. 2017; 8: 1294Google Scholar) and across IgG1 populations (Fu et al., 2016Fu C. Lu L. Wu H. Shaman J. Cao Y. Fang F. Yang Q. He Q. Yang Z. Wang M. Placental antibody transfer efficiency and maternal levels: specific for measles, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, poliomyelitis I-III and HIV-1 antibodies.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38874Google Scholar), raising the possibility for FcRn-mediated preferential selection of IgG1 transfer. Thus, to begin to define the characteristics of antibodies that are preferentially transferred across the placenta, we aimed to define whether the transferred antibodies possessed any qualitative functional differences from those in mothers, focusing on pertussis-specific immunity. Using samples drawn from a cohort of 14 mother:cord pairs on the day of birth (Figure S1; Table S1), we compared the functional activity of antibodies specific to the four pertussis antigens included in the Tdap vaccine: pertactin (PTN), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), fimbriae 2/3 (FIM), and pertussis toxin (PTX) (Edwards and Berbers, 2014Edwards K.M. Berbers G.A. Immune responses to pertussis vaccines and disease.J. Infect. Dis. 2014; 209: S10-S15Google Scholar). While significant differences existed in the magnitude of antibody-dependent monocyte phagocytosis (ADCP) across the pertussis antigens, including higher levels of PTX compared to FIM-specific phagocytic antibodies in mothers (Figures 1A and 1B ), overall transfer of phagocytic antibodies was relatively stable across all specificities (Figures 1B and 1C). Similarly, heterogeneous magnitudes of antibody-dependent neutrophil phagocytosis (ADNP) were observed across antigen specificities (Figures 1D and 1E). However, significant differences were observed in antigen-specific ADNP transfer across specificities (Figure 1F), where FIM- and PTX-ADNP-inducing antibodies were transferred with high efficiency compared to FHA- and PTN-specific antibodies. These data point to heterogeneity in overall levels and transfer efficiencies across pertussis-specific monocyte and neutrophil recruiting antibodies, driven in an antigen-specific manner. To define whether the same variability would be observed across NK cell-activating antibodies, we examined the ability of the maternal and cord antibodies to drive NK cell degranulation (CD107a upregulation), NK cell cytokine secretion (interferon-γ [IFNγ]), and chemokine secretion (macrophage inflammatory protein-1β [MIP-1β]). Strikingly, while lower levels of FHA-specific NK cell-activating antibodies were observed across all mothers, all mothers transferred elevated levels of NK cell-activating antibodies (across all three degranulation readouts) (Figures 1H–1J), albeit at different transfer ratios (Figures 1K–1M). Across all antigen specificities and mother:cord pairs, enhanced antibody transfer was consistently observed for NK cell-activating antibodies. Thus, our data demonstrate the preferential transfer of antibodies involved in NK cell activation to neonates, providing the first evidence of a functional, potentially Fc-specific, sieving across the placenta. To confirm that the preferential transfer of NK cell recruiting antibodies could be extended beyond pertussis-specific immunity, the functional characteristics of virus-specific antibodies were interrogated. Similar to the results observed for pertussis, significant variability existed in the levels of functional antibodies to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza (Flu) across mothers (Figures 2A and 2B ), accompanied by variable ADCP and ADNP transfer across each antigen (Figures 2A–2D). Conversely, enhanced transfer of NK cell IFNγ- and MIP-1β-inducing antibodies were transferred across both specificities, as were degranulation (CD107a)-inducing antibodies to RSV (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2A). Additionally, the NK cell transfer signature was further validated in a second, geographically distinct cohort across pertussis, RSV, and measles, highlighting again, preferential transfer of NK-activating antibodies to neonates (Figure S2B). Thus, despite heterogeneous baseline pathogen-specific functional antibody levels, NK-cell-activating antibodies are consistently preferentially transferred across the placenta.Figure S2NK Degranulation Selection across Cohorts, Related to Figure 2Show full captionA.

To begin to define the specific biophysical characteristics of antibodies that are selectively sieved via the placenta, we next examined the transfer of both antigen-specific IgG subclass and Fc glycosylation, which both influence Fc effector functions (Davies et al., 2001Davies J. Jiang L. Pan L.Z. LaBarre M.J. Anderson D. Reff M. Expression of GnTIII in a recombinant anti-CD20 CHO production cell line: Expression of antibodies with altered glycoforms leads to an increase in ADCC through higher affinity for FC gamma RIII.Biotechnol.

As expected, total IgG was enhanced in the cords across the four pertussis antigens for all pairs (Figure 3A). IgG1 were transferred preferentially (Figure 3B), whereas, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 levels were largely equivalent across the mother and cord, with equivalent or lower transfer ratios across antigens (Figure 3B). As previously described (Fu et al., 2016Fu C. Lu L. Wu H. Shaman J. Cao Y. Fang F. Yang Q. He Q. Yang Z. Wang M. Placental antibody transfer efficiency and maternal levels: specific for measles, coxsackievirus A16, enterovirus 71, poliomyelitis I-III and HIV-1 antibodies.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 38874Google Scholar), differences were detected in transfer ratios across antigen specificities, with reduced transfer of FIM-specific IgG1 responses relative to other antigens, again highlighting qualitative differences in antigen-specific antibody transfer, beyond subclass differences, that may account for differences in transfer ratios. Importantly, while these data confirm the preferential transfer of IgG1, they fail to explain why some antigen specificities and functions transfer more efficiently than others. Beyond IgG subclass effects on Fc receptor (FcR) binding, Fc glycosylation is also linked to changes in regulating antibody effector function via altered FcR affinity (Jennewein and Alter, 2017Jennewein M.F. Alter G. The Immunoregulatory Roles of Antibody Glycosylation.Trends Immunol. 2017; 38: 358-372Google Scholar). While univariate analyses pointed to significant changes in Fc-galactosylation across mother:cord pairs (Figures 3D and S3), we explored Fc-glycan-driven sieving using transfer efficiencies (Figures 3E–3G and S4). Both bulk (all IgG in plasma) and FHA-specific agalactosylated (G0) antibodies were transferred poorly (Figures 3D–3F). Conversely, digalactosylated (G2) and total galactosylated (G) bulk and total galactosylated (G) FHA-specific antibodies were transferred preferentially to the cord (Figures 3E and 3F). Further comparison across antibody populations highlighted consistent inhibition of the transfer of agalactosylated and bisected antibodies and enhanced transfer of galactosylated and sialylated antibodies across bulk and most antigen-specific antibody populations, except PTX-specific antibodies (Figures 3G and S4). Combined, these data point to a potentially critical role for Fc glycosylation, in addition to subclass, in placental sieving of antibodies.Figure S4Transfer Ratio of Antigen-Specific Fc-Glycans, Related to Figure 3Show full captionA.

To gain a deeper appreciation for the key Fc signatures linked to antibody transfer, a multi-level partial least-squares discriminant analysis (MLPLSDA) was used. This analysis was aimed at defining the antibody features, independent of overall mother:cord pair variation, that contributed to the sieving effect (Westerhuis et al., 2010Westerhuis J.A. van Velzen E.J. Hoefsloot H.C. Smilde A.K. Multivariate paired data analysis: multilevel PLSDA versus OPLSDA.Metabolomics. 2010; 6: 119-128Google Scholar). Clear separation was observed across the maternal and cord antibody profiles (Figure 4A). Features were then ranked based on their overall contribution to separating the mother:cord Fc-profiles (Figure 4B). In agreement with the univariate analysis and non-paired conventional orthogonalized PLSDA analysis (Figures S5A and S5B), the ability of antibodies to drive NK cell activation were among the top 3 enriched features in the cord blood antibody profile. Additionally, the ability to drive neutrophil phagocytosis, IgG1 levels, and particular antigen-specific glycans were among the top features enriched in the cord antibody profiles. Conversely, monogalactosylated glycans (G1F/GIFB) and the ability to drive monocyte phagocytosis (ADCP) were retained in the mother’s plasma. Furthermore, validation on RSV-specific and Flu-specific antibody profiles, separately, as well as simultaneously across all seven tested antigens, replicated the clear split between intra-pair mother:cord antibody profiles, always driven by NK cell function and glycan patterns (G2S1F predominantly) (Figures S2C–S2F). These data provide a first glimpse of the individual functional and biophysical characteristics associated with placental transfer, across an array of antigen-specificities, and point to galactosylation as a key predictor of placental sieving.Figure S5Computational Analysis of Paired Maternal:Cord Samples, Related to Figure 5Show full captionAn OPLSDA was used to analyze the features separating mother and cord blood samples. Each dot represents an individual blood sample (mother or cord) tested for one of the four antigens.

https://openalex.org/W2950287221,"In motor neocortex, preparatory activity predictive of specific movements is maintained by a positive feedback loop with the thalamus. Motor thalamus receives excitatory input from the cerebellum, which learns to generate predictive signals for motor control. The contribution of this pathway to neocortical preparatory signals remains poorly understood. Here, we show that, in a virtual reality conditioning task, cerebellar output neurons in the dentate nucleus exhibit preparatory activity similar to that in anterolateral motor cortex prior to reward acquisition. Silencing activity in dentate nucleus by photoactivating inhibitory Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex caused robust, short-latency suppression of preparatory activity in anterolateral motor cortex. Our results suggest that preparatory activity is controlled by a learned decrease of Purkinje cell firing in advance of reward under supervision of climbing fiber inputs signaling reward delivery. Thus, cerebellar computations exert a powerful influence on preparatory activity in motor neocortex."

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) partly implements this process by regulating thalamic activity through modality-specific thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) subnetworks. However, because the PFC does not directly project to sensory TRN subnetworks, the circuitry underlying this process had been unknown. Here, using anatomical tracing, functional manipulations, and optical identification of PFC projection neurons, we find that the PFC regulates sensory thalamic activity through a basal ganglia (BG) pathway. Engagement of this PFC-BG-thalamus pathway enables selection between vision and audition by primarily suppressing the distracting modality. This pathway also enhances sensory discrimination and is used for goal-directed background noise suppression. Overall, our results identify a new pathway for attentional filtering and reveal its multiple roles in sensory processing on the basis of internal goals. To make adaptive decisions, organisms must appropriately filter sensory inputs, augmenting relevant signals and suppressing noise. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) partly implements this process by regulating thalamic activity through modality-specific thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) subnetworks. However, because the PFC does not directly project to sensory TRN subnetworks, the circuitry underlying this process had been unknown. Here, using anatomical tracing, functional manipulations, and optical identification of PFC projection neurons, we find that the PFC regulates sensory thalamic activity through a basal ganglia (BG) pathway. Engagement of this PFC-BG-thalamus pathway enables selection between vision and audition by primarily suppressing the distracting modality. This pathway also enhances sensory discrimination and is used for goal-directed background noise suppression. Overall, our results identify a new pathway for attentional filtering and reveal its multiple roles in sensory processing on the basis of internal goals. An animal’s survival depends on its ability to appropriately extract relevant signals from its environment (Heekeren et al., 2008Heekeren H.R. Marrett S. Ungerleider L.G.

Conversion of sensory signals into perceptual decisions.Prog. Neurobiol. 2013; 103: 41-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Because such signals are often embedded in varying levels of sensory noise, the ability to selectively amplify relevant inputs and suppress distractors is of paramount importance (Cohen and Maunsell, 2009Cohen M.R. Maunsell J.H. Attention improves performance primarily by reducing interneuronal correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, Parr and Friston, 2018Parr T. Friston K.J. Attention or salience?.Curr. Opin. Psychol. 2018; 29: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these “filtering” operations are thought to be automatically implemented at multiple levels of sensory processing (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J.

Sensory adaptation.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Sensory filtering operations are also engaged by goal-directed (also known as “top-down” or executive) control (Squire et al., 2013Squire R.F. Noudoost B. Schafer R.J. Moore T.

Maunsell J.H.R. Attention-related changes in correlated neuronal activity arise from normalization mechanisms.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For example, non-human primate experiments have shown that changes in sensory processing are influenced by executive control from prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Moore and Fallah, 2004Moore T. Fallah M. Microstimulation of the frontal eye field and its effects on covert spatial attention.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 152-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Noudoost et al., 2010Noudoost B.

The observation of this type of control has led to the notion that the PFC is a flexible network capable of linking behaviorally relevant inputs to the regulation of ongoing sensorimotor transformations elsewhere (Miller and Cohen, 2001Miller E.K. Cohen J.D. An integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 167-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (8428) Google Scholar, Petersen and Posner, 2012Petersen S.E. Posner M.I. The attention system of the human brain: 20 years after.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that sensory thalamus is a locus for sensory filtering; when a mouse shifts between selecting and suppressing a broadband visual input with low feature complexity, changes in visual thalamic activity (lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]) predict successful behavior (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These changes in LGN activity reflect inhibitory control from the visual subnetwork of the thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN), which are in turn regulated by the prelimbic region of the PFC (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This work in mice complemented previous findings in humans (O’Connor et al., 2002O’Connor D.H. Fukui M.M. Pinsk M.A. Kastner S. Attention modulates responses in the human lateral geniculate nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1203-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) and non-human primates (McAlonan et al., 2008McAlonan K. Cavanaugh J. Wurtz R.H. Guarding the gateway to cortex with attention in visual thalamus.Nature. 2008; 456: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) in establishing the geniculate as a locus for goal-directed attentional filtering (Phillips et al., 2016Phillips J.M. Kambi N.A. Saalmann Y.B. A subcortical pathway for rapid, goal-driven, attentional filtering.Trends Neurosci. 2016; 39: 49-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, a circuit-level understanding of this type of top-down control, starting from how the PFC transforms task-relevant cues to sensory control signals and ending with behaviorally relevant changes within the sensory thalamus, is lacking. In addition, it is unclear whether such a pathway would only implement broad modality suppression relevant to cross-modal selection or whether it could have more general roles in attentional filtering. Even if such top-down control had limited feature selectivity and contributed to modality-specific broad noise suppression, for example, such a filtering operation would be a crucial prerequisite for subsequent cortical processes underlying selective attention (Hafter et al., 2008Hafter M.M. Sarampalis A. Loui P. Auditory attention and filters.in: Auditory Perception of Sound Sources. Vol. 29. Springer, 2008Google Scholar). To address these challenges, we adopted a circuit-level approach in which we first sought to identify the pathways involved in executive control of thalamic sensory filtering. Our experiments revealed a novel pathway by which prefrontal control of visTRN activity was mediated through basal ganglia (BG) intermediaries. In addition to broad suppression of distracting sensory input with low feature complexity, we found that this same pathway was engaged to enhance auditory feature selectivity. More specifically, prefrontal circuits transformed learned cues to pathway-specific output signals that ultimately enhanced auditory TRN function, supporting the ability to maintain sparse activity in auditory thalamus despite broadband background noise. Our findings provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying the PFC’s ability to exert goal-directed sensory filtering within and across modalities. We had previously found that neurons within the visTRN show bidirectional changes in spike rates predictive of appropriate cross-modal sensory selection task (Figure S1A) (Rikhye et al., 2018Rikhye R.V.

Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). At the core of the task is sensory selection, in which freely behaving mice selected between spatially conflicting visual and auditory targets to receive a reward (Figure 1A). At the beginning of each trial, mice were presented with 100 ms of either low- or high-pass-filtered white noise, which corresponded to two rules for sensory selection: attend to vision (ignore audition) and attend to audition (ignore vision), respectively. By design, sensory selection in this task was asymmetric: the visual target was either a right- or a left-sided flash that indicated the appropriate reward port location on that trial, while the binaural auditory target was either an up- or a down-sweep indicating the right or left reward port location, respectively (Figure 1B). This asymmetry meant that visual selection required the animal only to identify simple contrast changes, while auditory selection required feature categorization. To distinguish these two operations, we refer to them as visual contrast “detection” (Busse et al., 2011Busse L. Ayaz A. Dhruv N.T. Katzner S. Saleem A.B. Schölvinck M.L. Zaharia A.D. Carandini M. The detection of visual contrast in the behaving mouse.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11351-11361Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and auditory feature “discrimination” (Dragoi et al., 2002Dragoi V. Sharma J. Miller E.K. Sur M.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In this task, visTRN neurons showed a decrease or increase in spike rate prior to stimulus onset depending on whether vision was selected or ignored, respectively (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Because these changes were diminished when the PFC was suppressed, and because the PFC has been shown to encode and maintained cue information during target anticipation (Rikhye et al., 2018Rikhye R.V. Gilra A. Halassa M.M. Thalamic regulation of switching between cortical representations enables cognitive flexibility.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, Schmitt et al., 2017Schmitt L.I. Wimmer R.D. Nakajima M. Happ M. Mofakham S. Halassa M.M. Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control.Nature. 2017; 545: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) we reasoned that the PFC exerts top-down control over thalamic sensory processing to regulate sensory selection (Figure 1C). Interestingly, we found that enhanced spiking on attend to audition trials, which presumably suppresses an expected distracting visual input, was diminished by PFC suppression (Figure 1D). This finding, along with the fact that visTRN neural suppression has been shown to selectively diminish performance on the same trial type (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), supports the notion that PFC recruitment of sensory TRN is used to broadly suppress a distracting modality. How does the PFC exert its control on thalamic sensory processing? We found that the PFC does not directly project to visTRN (Figures 1E and 1F) (or the auditory subnetwork of the TRN [audTRN]; Figure S1B), indicating that intermediate circuits are required. Because it was unclear how many links there were between PFC and visTRN, we took two complementary approaches: an anatomical one in which we identified putative inputs to visTRN and a functional one in which we systematically inactivated PFC output pathways, assessing which particular inactivation gave rise to modality-specific behavioral deficits like those seen when the visTRN itself is inactivated (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These two lines of investigation converged on the BG as key intermediate circuits coupling PFC to sensory thalamus. First, we performed monosynaptic rabies tracing to identify inputs to visTRN neurons (Figure 1G; Figures S1C and S1D) modified from previous methods (Sun et al., 2014Sun Y. Nguyen A.Q. Nguyen J.P. Le L. Saur D. Choi J. Callaway E.M. Xu X.

U S A. 2010; 107: 21848-21853Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Tracing showed a substantial source of presynaptic inputs from the caudal region of the globus pallidus (GP; Figure 1H; Figures S1E and S1F). The GP region identified received GABAergic presynaptic input from the dorsal region of the tail of striatum (Figure 1I) (Menegas et al., 2017Menegas W. Babayan B.M. Uchida N. Watabe-Uchida M. Opposite initialization to novel cues in dopamine signaling in ventral and posterior striatum in mice.eLife. 2017; 6: e21886Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is known to receive primary visual cortical inputs (Figure S1G) (Jiang and Kim, 2018Jiang H. Kim H.F. Anatomical inputs from the sensory and value structures to the tail of the rat striatum.Front. Neuroanat. 2018; 12: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, Oh et al., 2014Oh S.W.

Henry A.M. et al.A mesoscale connectome of the mouse brain.Nature. 2014; 508: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), as well as direct PFC inputs (Hunnicutt et al., 2016Hunnicutt B.J. Jongbloets B.C. Birdsong W.T. Gertz K.J. Zhong H. Mao T. A comprehensive excitatory input map of the striatum reveals novel functional organization.eLife. 2016; 5: e19103Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We refer to this region as visual striatum (visStriatum). Second, we found that optogenetic suppression of PFC terminals in visStriatum disrupted performance only on trials that required animals to suppress the visual target (Figures 1J and 1K; Figure S1H). We found that a similar selective effect was produced by visTRN suppression (Figure 1L). Such evidence for a PFC output carrying a modality-specific signal was not seen in all other output pathways tested, which either gave symmetric performance deficits across modalities (Figure 1M; Figure S1H) or no effects at all (Figures S1I and S1J). These effects were unlikely to be artifacts of optogenetic intervention, as EGFP control experiments did not affect task performance (Figure S1K). To test the hypothesis that the PFC generates a modality-specific signal propagated via the visStriatum and visTRN to suppress visual inputs, we recorded the activity of PFC neurons that project to visStriatum (PFCvisStriatum). If our hypothesis was correct, these neurons would display modality-specific neural signals during the 2AFC task delay period. As such, we performed optogenetic tagging of PFCvisStriatum neurons using the retrograde non-toxic canine adenovirus (CAV2), allowing us to track their activity in the task (Figures 2A–2E; see STAR Methods). Previous studies have shown that PFC neurons encode and maintain the task-relevant cues through sequential population activity in which individual neurons show transient increases in spike rate (Schmitt et al., 2017Schmitt L.I. Wimmer R.D. Nakajima M. Happ M. Mofakham S. Halassa M.M. Thalamic amplification of cortical connectivity sustains attentional control.Nature. 2017; 545: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Such “peaks” in spike rate tile the delay period of the task, maintaining a temporally sparse representation of the cue. Here, we found that a subset of PFCvisStriatum neurons also showed peaks tiling the delay period. In these neurons, however, peaks were almost exclusively found for attend to audition trials (Figures 2F–2H). In agreement with these observations, cue information could be decoded from this population exclusively in the attend to audition trials (Figures 2I and 2J). Combined, these results suggest that PFC outputs to visStriatum are generally involved in the suppression of thalamic visual transmission when vision is behaviorally irrelevant. The cross-modal sensory selection 2AFC task is, by design, asymmetric. That is, the visual and auditory targets have different degrees of feature complexity. Although visual targets are a right- or left-sided light flash whose presence requires simple “detection,” the auditory targets are binaurally presented up- or down-sweeps requiring feature “discrimination.” A number of studies have shown that these types of operations are implemented in fundamentally different ways in the brain. More specifically, whereas detection requires sensory cortical engagement only when stimulus contrast is near threshold (Glickfeld et al., 2013Glickfeld L.L. Histed M.H. Maunsell J.H. Mouse primary visual cortex is used to detect both orientation and contrast changes.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 19416-19422Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, Cone et al., 2019Cone J.J.

Different inhibitory interneuron cell classes make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.eNeuro. 2019; 6 (ENEURO.0337-18.2019)Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), discrimination engages sensory cortex more generally (Letzkus et al., 2011Letzkus J.J. Wolff S.B. Meyer E.M. Tovote P. Courtin J. Herry C. Lüthi A.

Boyden E.S. et al.Activation of specific interneurons improves V1 feature selectivity and visual perception.Nature. 2012; 488: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). As such, these two processes can be differentially, and sometimes oppositely, affected by a particular manipulation (Guo et al., 2017Guo W. Clause A.R. Barth-Maron A. Polley D.B. A corticothalamic circuit for dynamic switching between feature detection and discrimination.Neuron. 2017; 95: 180-194.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Olsen et al., 2012Olsen S.R. Bortone D.S. Adesnik H. Scanziani M. Gain control by layer six in cortical circuits of vision.Nature. 2012; 483: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In line with these studies, we previously had found that primary visual cortex (V1) inactivation causes a shift in visual detection threshold when the animal has to simply detect the location of a visual flash (right versus left) in an uncued manner (Wimmer et al., 2015Wimmer R.D. Schmitt L.I. Davidson T.J. Nakajima M. Deisseroth K. Halassa M.M. Thalamic control of sensory selection in divided attention.Nature. 2015; 526: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the cross-modal task, this translated to a relatively small detriment in performance on visual trials. Conversely, suppression of primary auditory cortex (A1) reduced performance down to chance level rather than producing a quantitative detriment in behavior. The idea that auditory and visual stimuli might be processed differently because of the asymmetric design of the cross-modal sensory selection task led us to wonder if this difference is reflected in the engagement of TRN by the PFC-BG-thalamus pathway. Similar to visTRN, audTRN neurons receive inputs from the GP (Figures S2A and S2B), suggesting that any observed differences could not be explained by fundamental differences in circuit architecture. Two-color rabies tracing also revealed that presynaptic inputs to the audTRN and visTRN are largely non-overlapping (3% overlap 12 of 354]; Figures 3A and 3B ), suggesting that these circuits are likely to be controlled separately, potentially by different striatal inputs. Because the auditory striatum (audStriatum; Figure S2C) receives PFC inputs analogous to those of the visStriatum (Hunnicutt et al., 2016Hunnicutt B.J. Jongbloets B.C. Birdsong W.T. Gertz K.J. Zhong H. Mao T. A comprehensive excitatory input map of the striatum reveals novel functional organization.eLife. 2016; 5: e19103Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we were able to record and manipulate their corresponding PFC control (PFCaudStriatum neurons or their terminals in audStriatum) in the context of the 2AFC task. Compared with PFCvisStriatum neurons, PFCaudStriatum neurons showed significant selectivity toward both task-relevant cues (Figures 3C–3F). More precisely, although these neurons were more likely to encode the attend to vision than the attend to audition cue (Figure 3F), the relative selectivity between these cues was significantly lower compared with that observed for PFCvisStriatum neurons (Figure S2D). Moreover, in contrast to the selective behavioral effects seen with PFC terminal suppression in visStriatum (Figure 1K), PFC terminal suppression in audStriatum led to impaired performance on both cueing conditions (Figures 3G and 3H; Figures S2E and S2F). At this point, it was becoming clear that the asymmetry in the task design was indeed being translated to asymmetries in neural activity and causal engagement in the task along the visual and auditory PFC-BG-thalamus pathways. However, it remained unclear exactly why the auditory pathway was being engaged in both trial types. The auditory cues used to indicate trial types were unlikely to be the reason of this dual engagement, as previous studies showed that the cueing modality has little or no impact on either performance of this task or the associated patterns of prefrontal engagement (Rikhye et al., 2018Rikhye R.V. Gilra A. Halassa M.M. Thalamic regulation of switching between cortical representations enables cognitive flexibility.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1753-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To better understand how the PFC-audStriatum pathway engaged auditory processing in both trial types, we examined the activity in the auditory thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body [MGBv]) during the task. Because our experiments in the visual pathway showed that top-down control is necessary for suppressing distracting visual thalamic inputs, we asked whether a similar effect was taking place at the level of MGBv neurons. Indeed, evoked MGBv neural responses were reduced in attend to vision compared with attend to audition trials (Figures 3I and 3J), an effect that was quantitatively comparable with that seen for LGN with respect to visual selection (Figure 3K). Although changes in MGBv spiking were observed across cueing conditions, they were non-uniform across the population; MGBv neurons that displayed a preference toward a specific auditory target (up- versus down-sweep) emitted spikes that were more informative of these targets during the attend to audition compared with attend to vision trials (Figures 3J and 3L). This finding, combined with the fact that attend to audition trials also engaged the PFC-to-audStriatum pathway, suggested that auditory discrimination may require some degree of top-down auditory thalamic suppression. This suppression would enforce a sparse auditory thalamic output, which is consistent with our decoding values (Figure 3L) and would render target stimulus features to be maximally separable at the level of cortical readout (Chechik et al., 2006Chechik G.

Cooke J.E. King A.J. Hearing in noisy environments: noise invariance and contrast gain control.J. Physiol. 2014; 592: 3371-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A close examination of our electrophysiological recordings supported the notion that auditory discrimination engages thalamic inhibition and that this is an explanation for the neural asymmetries observed across the PFC-BG-thalamic pathway in this design of the 2AFC task. Specifically, we found that putative audTRN neurons (Figures S3A–3AG; see STAR Methods) showed an increase in spike rates during the delay period of the task for both attend to audition and attend to vision trials (Figures 4A–4C). Although this spike rate increase was quantitatively smaller for attend to audition trials compared with attend to vision trials, audTRN activity was qualitatively different than visTRN activity in this task, in which the latter population showed reduced spiking only when the upcoming relevant target was visual (Figure 4C). The different behaviors of audTRN and visTRN support the notion that task-design asymmetries may have enforced asymmetric engagement of the identified PFC-BG-thalamus circuits, which was read out behaviorally when this pathway was suppressed (Figures 1K and 3H; Figure S2E), and neurally in the asymmetry seen across the different sensory TRN subnetworks (Figure 4C). A potential caveat for this idea, however, is the inherent asymmetry between vision and audition being distinct sensory processing pathways. To investigate this issue, we trained mice on a symmetric 2AFC task, in which the auditory component was a simple detection of a left- or right-sided tone cloud (Figure 4D). Remarkably, this task design resulted in audTRN activity profiles across the two cueing conditions that were qualitatively similar to visTRN activity profiles in the original 2AFC task, in which spike rates were suppressed prior to the preferred stimulus presentation (Figures 4E and 4F). These findings confirmed that goal-directed control of sensory thalamic processing is distinct when the sensory operation is a simple detection versus when it is a feature discrimination and suggested a possible general role for the PFC-BG-thalamus pathway in goal-directed sensory filtering relevant for feature extraction. To directly investigate the role of audTRN in auditory feature discrimination, we performed targeted electrophysical and behavioral studies. First, we recorded sensory responses of MGBv neurons to complex auditory stimuli (dynamic random chords; see STAR Methods) while performing randomized, interleaved, optogenetic inactivation of audTRN (Figure 5A). We found a marked decrease in feature selectivity in MGBv neurons when audTRN was suppressed, an effect that was worsened by noise (example in Figure 5B). We quantified the impact of this reduced selectivity at the population level through two metrics (population decoding, Figure 5C; Fano factor, Figure S4A), both of which supported the necessity of intact audTRN function to maintain discriminability of neural signal"

Examples include the proliferation-quiescence cell-fate decision under normal conditions (Arora et al., 2017Arora M. Moser J. Phadke H. Basha A.A. Spencer S.L.

However, drug-treated cells also have the possibility to choose a senescence fate. When cancer cells experience non-lethal doses of chemotherapy, such as due to rapid decline of drug concentration during treatment (Gewirtz, 1999Gewirtz D.A. A critical evaluation of the mechanisms of action proposed for the antitumor effects of the anthracycline antibiotics adriamycin and daunorubicin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar), they can withdraw from the cell cycle and enter a senescence-like state, referred to as “therapy-induced senescence” (Ewald et al., 2010Ewald J.A. Desotelle J.A. Wilding G. Jarrard D.F. Therapy-induced senescence in cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2010; 102: 1536-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). This state is associated with significant changes in morphology and metabolic activities, which are seen when normal cells enter replicative senescence (Kuilman et al., 2010Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. The essence of senescence.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). Clinically, there is growing evidence that therapy-induced senescence occurs in tumors and is associated with improved clinical outcomes (Collado and Serrano, 2010Collado M. Serrano M.

Indeed, inducing senescence in cancers has recently been explored as a therapeutic strategy with the potential to reduce cytotoxicity (Ewald et al., 2010Ewald J.A. Desotelle J.A. Wilding G.

However, liabilities of these strategies include that proliferative subpopulations can emerge after treatment (Elmore et al., 2005Elmore L.W. Di X. Dumur C. Holt S.E. Gewirtz D.A.

Deal A.M. et al.Cellular Senescence Promotes Adverse Effects of Chemotherapy and Cancer Relapse.Cancer Discov. 2017; 7: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). A key molecular mediator of therapy-induced senescence is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) (Abbas and Dutta, 2009Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, Cazzalini et al., 2010Cazzalini O. Scovassi A.I.

Res. 2010; 704: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). p21 halts the cell-cycle progression after transcriptional activation by p53, which is a DNA damage response triggered by many senescence-inducing agents (d’Adda di Fagagna, 2008d’Adda di Fagagna F.

WAF1, a potential mediator of p53 tumor suppression.Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7916) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, there is evidence that p21 has the ability to promote both proliferation and senescence cell-fate outcomes (Abbas and Dutta, 2009Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, Cazzalini et al., 2010Cazzalini O. Scovassi A.I.

On the one hand, classic studies establish an active role of p21 in promoting therapy-induced senescence (Roninson, 2003Roninson I.B. Tumor cell senescence in cancer treatment.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2705-2715PubMed Google Scholar). p21 accumulates during the process of senescence development (3–7 days) (te Poele et al., 2002te Poele R.H. Okorokov A.L. Jardine L. Cummings J. Joel S.P. DNA damage is able to induce senescence in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1876-1883PubMed Google Scholar), senescent cells are typically observed expressing high levels of p21 (Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d’Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar), and knockout or overexpression of p21 is sufficient to bypass or induce senescence, respectively (Brown et al., 1997Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Bypass of senescence after disruption of p21CIP1/WAF1 gene in normal diploid human fibroblasts.Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, Fang et al., 1999Fang L. Igarashi M. Leung J. Sugrue M.M. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. p21Waf1/Cip1/Sdi1 induces permanent growth arrest with markers of replicative senescence in human tumor cells lacking functional p53.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2789-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, this body of research has been classically focused on time points after senescence phenotypes have become detectable and has been largely based on pooled-population studies. Recent single-cell work, using live-cell p21 reporters, showed that p21 induction at 5 h after DNA-damaging treatment is predictive of a loss of proliferative potential at 24 h (Stewart-Ornstein and Lahav, 2016Stewart-Ornstein J. Lahav G. Dynamics of CDKN1A in Single Cells Defined by an Endogenous Fluorescent Tagging Toolkit.Cell Rep. 2016; 14: 1800-1811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). While classic senescence phenotypes have not yet manifested by 24 h after treatment, these results suggest the hypothesis that early, high levels of p21 expression promote a final senescence cell-fate decision. On the other hand, an emerging body of evidence suggests that p21 plays an active role in promoting a proliferative outcome after chemotherapy. p21 participates in DNA repair indirectly, by halting cell-cycle progression to provide time for DNA repair and, directly, by regulating the interactions between components involved in repair pathways (Cazzalini et al., 2010Cazzalini O. Scovassi A.I. Savio M. Stivala L.A. Prosperi E. Multiple roles of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(CDKN1A) in the DNA damage response.Mutat. Res. 2010; 704: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). For example, p21 has been shown to enhance the repair of chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and protect glioma cells from apoptosis (Ruan et al., 1998Ruan S. Okcu M.F. Ren J.P. Chiao P. Andreeff M. Levin V. Zhang W. Overexpressed WAF1/Cip1 renders glioblastoma cells resistant to chemotherapy agents 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and cisplatin.Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1538-1543PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, radiation-induced p53-independent upregulation of p21 in stem cells limited damage accumulation and promoted the expansion of a stem cell pool (Insinga et al., 2013Insinga A. Cicalese A. Faretta M. Gallo B. Albano L. Ronzoni S. Furia L. Viale A. Pelicci P.G. DNA damage in stem cells activates p21, inhibits p53, and induces symmetric self-renewing divisions.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 3931-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results suggest the opposing hypothesis that early, high levels of p21 expression in therapy promote a final proliferation cell fate. How do early signaling events connect to final proliferation-senescence cell fate? The slow development of senescence phenotypes makes studying this decision at early time points challenging. Classic senescence-associated phenotypes, including morphological changes and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (Dimri et al., 1995Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. et al.A biomarker that identifies senescent human cells in culture and in aging skin in vivo.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar), are undetectable until multiple days (3–7) after treatment (Ewald et al., 2010Ewald J.A. Desotelle J.A. Wilding G. Jarrard D.F. Therapy-induced senescence in cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2010; 102: 1536-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In contrast, early signs of commitment to apoptosis can appear within hours after treatment (Suzuki et al., 2001Suzuki K. Kostin S. Person V. Elsässer A. Schaper J. Time course of the apoptotic cascade and effects of caspase inhibitors in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 983-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Identifying early signaling events that influence cell fate will allow us to understand the logic of the proliferation-senescence decision circuit and, ultimately, inform therapeutic strategies that minimize the emergence of proliferative subpopulations. Here, we demonstrated a causal role of early p21 dynamics in this decision process. We monitored endogenous p21 dynamics and inferred cell-cycle progression at the single-cell level before, during, and days after drug treatment. p21 was found to promote either proliferation or senescence fates, depending on its patterns of early dynamics during treatment. Surprisingly, during drug treatment, p21 levels were low in S/G2—the cell-cycle phases with highest levels of DNA damage and a major reservoir of senescence-fated cells. Using genetic and pharmacological perturbations, Chk1 activity and proteasomal degradation were identified as molecular mechanisms that repressed p21 expression in the highly damaged cell-cycle phases. A mathematical model was used to elucidate how different patterns of p21 dynamics could emerge from the observed cell-cycle-dependent p21 expression and DNA damage responses. Interestingly, a non-monotonic relationship between p21 expression and cell fate was identified. While either low or high p21 expression during treatment leads to a senescence fate, intermediate p21 levels promote cell proliferation, which leads to a p21 “Goldilocks zone” for proliferation. Finally, studying the relation between cell fate and p21 dynamics enabled the identification and targeting of cells that give rise to the final proliferative subpopulation after treatment. Together, this work revealed opposing functions of early p21 dynamics in determining final cell fate that manifested days after exposure to non-lethal doses of chemotherapy. We developed an experimental system that would drive cancer cells into either proliferation or senescence fates. To induce senescence, we made use of the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin (Yang et al., 2014Yang F. Teves S.S. Kemp C.J. Henikoff S. Doxorubicin, DNA torsion, and chromatin dynamics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845: 84-89PubMed Google Scholar), which is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agents and has been shown to induce senescence across multiple cancer cell lines at clinically relevant doses (Chang et al., 1999Chang B.D. Broude E.V. Dokmanovic M. Zhu H. Ruth A. Xuan Y. Kandel E.S. Lausch E. Christov K. Roninson I.B. A senescence-like phenotype distinguishes tumor cells that undergo terminal proliferation arrest after exposure to anticancer agents.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3761-3767PubMed Google Scholar, Gewirtz, 1999Gewirtz D.A.

Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). To have mixed cell fates, a 1-day drug pulse was chosen, motivated by previous studies (Elmore et al., 2005Elmore L.W. Di X. Dumur C. Holt S.E. Gewirtz D.A. Evasion of a single-step, chemotherapy-induced senescence in breast cancer cells: implications for treatment response.Clin.

Collins J.M. Jenkins J.F. Speyer J.L. Myers C.E. Plasma pharmacokinetics of adriamycin and adriamycinol: implications for the design of in vitro experiments and treatment protocols.Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 3417-3421PubMed Google Scholar). A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells were treated with a 1-day pulse of 50 nM doxorubicin (day 1) followed by 4 days without drug (days 2–5). This dosage was low enough that apoptosis was rarely observed yet high enough to be clinically relevant (Gewirtz, 1999Gewirtz D.A. A critical evaluation of the mechanisms of action proposed for the antitumor effects of the anthracycline antibiotics adriamycin and daunorubicin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). On the final day (day 5), a mixture of senescent and proliferative cellular subpopulations was observed (Figures 1A and 1B , Pulsed). Cells displayed either similar senescence phenotypes as observed after a 5-day sustained treatment (Figure 1A, Pulsed versus Sustained, enlarged morphology and SA-β-gal+) or similar proliferation phenotypes as observed in untreated cells (Figure 1A, Pulsed versus Ctrl). Consistently, expression levels of other senescence or proliferation markers, such as p21, phospho-pRb, and Ki-67, showed bimodal distributions after the pulsed treatment (Figures 1A and 1C, bottom, and S1A), with senescent cells associated with high p21 but low phospho-pRb and Ki-67 expression (Banito and Lowe, 2013Banito A.

In fact, the mixture of proliferation and senescence fates after 1-day drug pulse was also observed in other chemotherapeutic agents and another cell line (Figure S1B).Figure S11-Day Pulsed Drug Treatment Leads to Mixed Proliferation and Senescence Fates across Multiple Cell Lines and Drugs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Left: example images of A549 cells stained with phospho-pRb or Ki-67 at day 5 after no treatment (Ctrl), pulsed (Pulsed), or continuous (Sustained) doxorubicin treatment at 50 nM.

Scale bar: 20 μm. What early signaling events might govern the proliferation-senescence cell-fate decision? We focused on the well-established senescence mediator p21 (Abbas and Dutta, 2009Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar, Cazzalini et al., 2010Cazzalini O. Scovassi A.I.

Previous work showed that drug-induced p21 expression is heterogeneous at 4 h after treatment (Stewart-Ornstein and Lahav, 2016Stewart-Ornstein J. Lahav G. Dynamics of CDKN1A in Single Cells Defined by an Endogenous Fluorescent Tagging Toolkit.Cell Rep. 2016; 14: 1800-1811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Consistently, we also found a bimodal distribution of p21 expression at early (12 h) time points during the pulsed treatment (Figure 1C, top), suggesting an early dichotomy of cell-fate decision. Considering the role of p21 in promoting senescence (Campisi and d’Adda di Fagagna, 2007Campisi J. d’Adda di Fagagna F. Cellular senescence: when bad things happen to good cells.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (2979) Google Scholar), we hypothesized a simple rule for the proliferation-senescence cell-fate decision (Figure 1C): early low p21 levels stay low and lead to a final proliferation fate, and early high p21 levels stay high and lead to a final senescence fate. Understanding how p21 expression during the drug pulse determines the final proliferation-senescence cell fate requires the ability to: monitor p21 levels at single-cell resolution and link early p21 expression levels to final cell fates. “eFlut” (Stewart-Ornstein and Lahav, 2016Stewart-Ornstein J.

CFP-tagged H2B and mCherry were also introduced as nuclear and cellular markers, respectively, to facilitate image analysis (Kang et al., 2016Kang J. Hsu C.H. Wu Q. Liu S. Coster A.D.

Biotechnol. 2016; 34: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The population doubling time of A549 p21V was less than 1 day (Figure S2C); the average cell-cycle length was 18 h, with 90% of the cells having cell-cycle length less than 24 h (Figure S2D), the duration of our drug pulse.Figure S2Validation of p21 Live-Cell Reporter Cell Lines, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) PCR design.

Our data illuminate mechanistic and functional aspects of organelle remodeling in viral infection and establish that pharmacological targeting of contact sites linking viral and host compartments is a potential strategy for antiviral development. Enteroviruses are common human pathogens linked to diverse medical complications, including diabetes, asthma, hepatitis, myocarditis, poliomyelitis, and meningitis. Despite their small genome and limited proteome, they are adept at modulating the host cellular machinery to achieve rapid replication. While vaccines are available for a single type of enterovirus, poliovirus, the vast majority of enteroviral infections have no prophylactic or therapeutic treatments available. Because all enteroviruses share common mechanisms of replication, identification of host pathways essential for enterovirus infection could provide targets for pan-enteroviral treatments. A critical step in the life cycle of enteroviruses is the replication of their positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. Genome replication occurs on special host-derived membrane compartments, called replication compartments (RCs), which form only in infected cells. Within hours of infection, numerous vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm of host cells (Dales et al., 1965Dales S. Eggers H.J. Tamm I. Palade G.E. Electron Microscopic Study of the Formation of Poliovirus.Virology. 1965; 26: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Viral proteins, viral RNA, and host factors are recruited to these vesicles to participate in the synthesis of the viral genome (Richards and Ehrenfeld, 1990Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. Poliovirus RNA replication.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 161: 89-119PubMed Google Scholar). Given that RCs are a universal feature of all enteroviral infections, blocking their formation may serve as a general anti-enteroviral therapeutic strategy. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of RCs and their lipid sources are poorly understood. A number of observations suggest that the biogenesis of enterovirus RCs is a complex process that involves multiple membrane trafficking and lipid metabolism pathways. Previous studies suggest that enteroviruses hijack transport intermediates of the secretory pathway and modulate their lipid and protein composition to create the RCs (Hsu et al., 2010Hsu N.Y. Ilnytska O. Belov G. Santiana M. Chen Y.H. Takvorian P.M. Pau C. van der Schaar H. Kaushik-Basu N. Balla T. et al.Viral reorganization of the secretory pathway generates distinct organelles for RNA replication.Cell. 2010; 141: 799-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The RCs are enriched in cholesterol provided by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ilnytska et al., 2013Ilnytska O. Santiana M. Hsu N.Y. Du W.L. Chen Y.H. Viktorova E.G. Belov G. Brinker A. Storch J.

In addition, enterovirus infection increases import of fatty acids (FAs) from the extracellular media for the synthesis of phospholipids for the RCs (Nchoutmboube et al., 2013Nchoutmboube J.A. Viktorova E.G. Scott A.J. Ford L.A. Pei Z. Watkins P.A. Ernst R.K. Belov G.A. Increased long chain acyl-Coa synthetase activity and fatty acid import is linked to membrane synthesis for development of picornavirus replication organelles.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003401Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To understand the biogenesis of RCs in the context of infection we focused on three enteroviruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract: poliovirus (PV), an important enterovirus model and the causing agent of poliomyelitis, Coxsackievirus B3, which causes myocarditis and diabetes, and enterovirus 71, which causes severe neurological diseases. Our findings uncover a key function of the host organelle lipid droplet (LD) in the formation of the RCs and enteroviral replication. LDs are important hubs of lipid metabolism in eukaryotic cells. They store lipids, which are used for energy production, membrane biogenesis, and signaling purposes, depending on the cells’ needs (Walther and Farese, 2012Walther T.C. Farese Jr., R.V. Lipid droplets and cellular lipid metabolism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 687-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, Zechner et al., 2012Zechner R. Zimmermann R. Eichmann T.O. Kohlwein S.D.

Despite their key role in lipid metabolism, possible involvement of LDs in the replication of enteroviruses had not been defined. In this study, we show that LDs are an important source of lipids for enterovirus RCs. We discover that three enteroviral proteins are targeted to LDs, and we provide evidence that one of these proteins, 2C, is involved in the formation of membrane contact sites that recruit LDs to the RCs. These virus-generated contact sites enable channeling of essential FAs from LDs to the growing RCs. We further show that viral proteins physically interact with the host lipolysis machinery whose function is essential to mobilize FAs from LDs for phospholipid synthesis for the RCs. As a result, LDs serve as lipid distribution centers that redirect FAs flux for RC formation. Importantly, blocking the formation of membrane contact sites between LDs and RCs or inhibition of lipolysis disrupts the biogenesis of RCs and blocks replication of several enteroviruses. Thus, our findings uncover a potential pan-enteroviral therapeutic strategy that relies on blocking the lipolysis pathway. In summary, our results reveal an important principle of spatial and functional remodeling of host cellular architecture by viral proteins and illuminate the mechanisms by which enteroviruses manipulate host cell lipid metabolism to allow viral replication. To examine a possible role of LDs in the life cycle of PV, the distribution and morphology of LDs in PV-infected HeLa cells were followed by time course immunofluorescence (IF) analysis. In this analysis, LDs were labeled with the dye Bodipy493/503, which stains the core of LDs, and with antibodies against the TIP47 protein, which is localized to the surface of LDs. We found that in mock-infected cells, LDs were distributed throughout the cell (Figure 1A). In contrast, at 6 h post-infection (hpi), LDs were incorporated into the network of viral RCs and concentrated at the juxtanuclear area. Concurrent with this translocation, the number of LDs and the area occupied by LDs decreased by 40% and 30%, respectively (Figure 1B). In addition, the intensity of TIP47 staining on the surface of LDs decreased by 37%. LD number and TIP47 intensity decreased further at 8 hpi, the peak time of virus particle formation. TIP47 protein levels remained constant during the infection (Figure S1A), suggesting that displacement of TIP47 from the surface of LDs led to the decrease in its intensity on LDs. Because TIP47 restricts access of lipases to the LD core, removal of TIP47 from the LD surface may increase the accessibility of lipids stored within LDs during PV infection.Figure S1Effects of PV Infection on the Distribution and Morphology of LDs, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) The protein levels of TIP47 remain constant during PV infection.

Most of the LDs are intercalated into the RCs, whereas most of the mitochondria remain in the cell periphery and are not incorporated into the RCs. Scale bar 10 μm. We then examined the spatial relationships between LDs and RCs at earlier times post infection (Figure 1C). Our IF analysis showed that at 4 hpi, the earliest time point at which RCs are visible, some of the LDs were in close apposition to the RCs (arrows, zoom panel). At 5 hpi, more LDs were seen in close proximity to the RCs. Finally, at 6 hpi, the vast majority of LDs were intercalated in the network of RCs. To quantify the proximity between LDs and RCs during infection, we measured the percentage of LDs that were at a minimal distance from the RCs (<1 pixel that equals 154 nm) in 3D reconstructions of confocal stacks. We found that the percentage of LDs closely opposed to the RCs increased from 33% at 4 hpi to 54% at 5 hpi and 68% at 6 hpi, suggesting that LDs are recruited to close proximity to the RCs as infection progresses (Figure 1D). Consistent with these changes in LD distribution, the mean distance between LDs and the nucleus decreased by 65% at 6 hpi (Figure S1B). Similar changes in LD distribution were observed in PV-infected Huh7 cells (Figure 1E) indicating that this viral effect is not limited to a specific cell type. To further illustrate the translocation of LDs during PV infection, we followed LDs and the host protein ARF1 which was previously shown to be recruited to the viral RCs during infection (Belov et al., 2007Belov G.A. Altan-Bonnet N. Kovtunovych G. Jackson C.L. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Ehrenfeld E. Hijacking components of the cellular secretory pathway for replication of poliovirus RNA.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) by IF analysis (Figure 1F; Video S1). In mock-infected cells, RFP-Arf1 was localized to the Golgi, and LDs were in the cell periphery with limited interface between the two compartments. However, at 6 hpi, RFP-Arf1 was recruited to PV RCs, which surrounded LDs in the juxtanuclear region. We conclude that PV infection induced the recruitment of LDs to close apposition with the RCs. This recruitment was specific because during infection, most of the mitochondria remained in the cell periphery and were not intercalated into the network of RCs (Figure S1C). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/52dfdf51-0447-4117-afdb-c6a8a34ede88/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

PV Infection Induces the Translocation of LDs from the Cell Periphery to the Juxtanuclear Region and Their Intercalation into the RCs, Related to Figure 1HeLa cells stably expressing RFP-Arf1 were infected with PV at moi 10. At 3 hpi cells were stained with Bodipy493/503 (green) for 5 min, washed and immediately imaged. Time-lapse confocal images were taken every 7 and half min for a total of 7 h. To examine the spatial relationships between LDs and RCs at higher resolution, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. In mock-infected HeLa cells, LDs were adjacent to ER tubules and mitochondria (Figures 2A and 2B ). This localization was consistent with previous studies showing that LDs form in the ER, and FAs are delivered from LDs to the mitochondria for ATP production. However, the membrane architecture of PV-infected cells at 6 hpi was strikingly different from that of mock cells, with numerous vesicles, known as RCs, occupying the cytoplasm (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A). In line with previous studies, these PV-induced vesicles were heterogeneous in their morphology: electron-lucent vesicles (black arrowheads) and vesicles with electron-dense core (cyan arrowheads) (Figure 2D). Consistent with our IF analysis, we detected multiple regions of close apposition between LDs and RCs (Figures 2E–2G and S2B). In TEM thin sections of randomly chosen cells, 62% of the LDs were within a distance of 30 nm from at least one RC (n = 189 LDs in 14 cells) (Table S1). Among these LDs, 59% were within a distance of 30 nm from more than one RC (Figure S2D), and in average, 10% of the LD perimeter was engaged in close membrane contacts with the RCs (Figure S2E). These properties are consistent with the characteristics of membrane contact sites, which are defined as regions in which the membranes of two organelles are within a distance of 30 nm and serve to facilitate transfer of signals and molecules between organelles (Prinz, 2014Prinz W.A. Bridging the gap: membrane contact sites in signaling, metabolism, and organelle dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 205: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The close apposition between LDs and RCs suggested that during PV infection, membrane contact sites formed between LDs and the RCs.Figure S2TEM Analysis of the Membrane Contacts between the ER, the LDs, and the RCs during PV Infection, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Low magnification micrograph of PV-infected HeLa cell at 6hpi.

The ER morphology in PV-infected cells was also substantially changed. ER tubules were dilated (Figure 2C) and some of them were connected to LDs that were simultaneously within a distance of 30 nm from RCs (Figures 2G, 2H, and S2C), suggesting that the three organelles are interconnected during PV infection. To gain insights into the mechanisms that underlie the changes in LD morphology and distribution during PV infection, we examined the possibility that viral proteins (Figure 3A) orchestrate these changes. For this purpose, single Strep-tagged PV proteins were ectopically expressed in HeLa cells and their localization to LDs was examined by IF analysis. This analysis showed that the intermediate protein 2BC is targeted to LDs (Figure 3B). Furthermore, overexpression of 2BC caused clustering of LDs and displacement of TIP47 from the surface of LD clusters (Figures 3C and 3D). To confirm that the localization of 2BC to LDs was not caused by the Strep-tag or limited to specific cell type, we also expressed non-tagged 2BC in HeLa cells (Figure S3A) and 2BC-Strep in Huh7 hepatoma cell-line (Figure S3B). In both cases, 2BC was targeted to LDs. In contrast, other PV proteins including the intermediate protein 3CD, 3C protease, and 3D RNA polymerase did not localize to LDs (Figure S3C), nor did PV capsid proteins (Figure S3D).Figure S3Targeting of 2BC, 2B, and 2C to LDs Is Conserved among Enteroviruses, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Ectopically expressed non-tagged PV 2BC is targeted to LDs.

During PV infection, 2BC is cleaved by the viral protease 3C to yield the mature proteins 2B and 2C (Figure 3A). We found that both mature proteins were also localized to LDs. 2C-Strep appeared as rings on the surface of LDs, where it co-localized with TIP47 and caused clustering of LDs (Figures 3E and 3F). 2B, which was previously shown to localize to the Golgi (de Jong et al., 2003de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. Determinants for membrane association and permeabilization of the coxsackievirus 2B protein and the identification of the Golgi complex as the target organelle.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), was dually targeted to both the Golgi and the LDs (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3E) without causing clustering of LDs. To further confirm the targeting of 2BC, 2B, and 2C to LDs, we purified LDs from cells that ectopically express these viral proteins and examined the LD-associated proteins by immunoblotting (Figure 3I). The purified LD fractions contained the LD-associated adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and were depleted for ER, mitochondria, and cytosol markers (VAPB, TOM20, and GAPDH proteins, respectively) confirming the purity of these fractions. Consistent with our IF results, all three viral proteins were detected in the purified LD fractions. We further showed that Strep-tagged 2BC, 2B, and 2C proteins of Coxsackievirus B3 were also localized to LDs (Figures S3F–S3H). This conserved targeting, together with the fact that 3 out of 10 non-structural viral proteins were targeted to LDs, suggested that LDs play a key role in the life cycle of enteroviruses. To better understand the mechanism that is responsible for the LD-targeting of 2B and 2C, we next identified the LD-targeting determinants of both proteins. PV 2B contains two highly conserved membrane binding regions: N-terminal amphipathic helix (aa 35–52) and C-terminal hydrophobic domain (aa 61–80) (Figure 4A) (de Jong et al., 2003de Jong A.S. Wessels E. Dijkman H.B. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. Willems P.H. van Kuppeveld F.J. Determinants for membrane association and permeabilization of the coxsackievirus 2B protein and the identification of the Golgi complex as the target organelle.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1012-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that 2B truncation mutant containing aa 1–57 retained LD-targeting (Figure 4B). In contrast, a mutant containing aa 56–97 was distributed in the cytosol. These results indicated that the N-terminal region of 2B containing the amphipathic helix mediated its LD-targeting. PV 2C also contains a highly conserved N-terminal amphipathic helix (aa 17–38) that mediates its association with cellular membranes (Figure 4C; Teterina et al., 1997Teterina N.L. Gorbalenya A.E. Egger D. Bienz K. Ehrenfeld E. Poliovirus 2C protein determinants of membrane binding and rearrangements in mammalian cells.J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8962-8972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that truncation mutants deleted for this helix (2CΔ(17–38)) or the first 39 aa (2C(40–329)) lose their LD localization (Figure 4D) suggesting that the N-terminal helix is essential for the LD-targeting of 2C. In addition, small fragments containing the first 38 or 67 aa of 2C were targeted to LDs, appearing as puncta on the surface of LDs. Further extension of the N-terminal fragment of 2C to the first 91 aa, restored the ring shape pattern surrounding LDs observed for full-length 2C. This effect was not caused by a higher expression level of the fragment containing aa 1–91 as compared to a fragment containing aa 1–67 (Figure 4E). Altogether, these results suggested that the N-terminal amphipathic helix of 2C provided core binding to LD surface which was further enhanced by residues contained within aa 67–91. We then examined the role of 2B and 2C amphipathic helices in the LD-targeting of 2BC (Figure 4F). We found that 2BC mutants deleted for either helix (2BCΔ(1–56) and 2BCΔ(98–136)) retained their LD localization (Figure 4G). However, truncation mutant deficient for both helices lost its LD association. The existence of two independent LD-targeting determinants, one in 2B and the other in 2C, could be a mechanism to ensure that both mature proteins target the surface of LDs after the proteolytic processing of 2BC. Consistent with this possibility, mutations in the amphipathic helices of 2B and 2C were previously shown to be deleterious for enterovirus growth (Teterina et al., 2006Teterina N.L. Gorbalenya A.E.

https://openalex.org/W2952823957,"The Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (PfRH5) is the leading target for next-generation vaccines against the disease-causing blood-stage of malaria. However, little is known about how human antibodies confer functional immunity against this antigen. We isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against PfRH5 from peripheral blood B cells from vaccinees in the first clinical trial of a PfRH5-based vaccine. We identified a subset of mAbs with neutralizing activity that bind to three distinct sites and another subset of mAbs that are non-functional, or even antagonistic to neutralizing antibodies. We also identify the epitope of a novel group of non-neutralizing antibodies that significantly reduce the speed of red blood cell invasion by the merozoite, thereby potentiating the effect of all neutralizing PfRH5 antibodies as well as synergizing with antibodies targeting other malaria invasion proteins. Our results provide a roadmap for structure-guided vaccine development to maximize antibody efficacy against blood-stage malaria."

However, factors that modulate the placental transfer of IgG remain largely undefined. HIV-infected women have impaired placental IgG transfer, presenting a unique “disruption model” to define factors that modulate placental IgG transfer. We measured the placental transfer efficiency of maternal HIV and pathogen-specific IgG in US and Malawian HIV-infected mothers and their HIV-exposed uninfected and infected infants. We examined the role of maternal HIV disease progression, infant factors, placental Fc receptor expression, IgG subclass, and glycan signatures and their association with placental IgG transfer efficiency. Maternal IgG characteristics, such as binding to placentally expressed Fc receptors FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa, and Fc region glycan profiles were associated with placental IgG transfer efficiency. Our findings suggest that Fc region characteristics modulate the selective placental transfer of IgG, with implications for maternal vaccine design and infant health.

Our findings suggest that Fc region characteristics modulate the selective placental transfer of IgG, with implications for maternal vaccine design and infant health. Protective immunity in the first few months of life is reliant on maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) that is passively transferred across the placenta (Dowling and Levy, 2014Dowling D.J. Levy O. Ontogeny of early life immunity.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 299-310Google Scholar, Levy et al., 2013Levy O. Goriely S. Kollmann T.R. Immune response to vaccine adjuvants during the first year of life.Vaccine. 2013; 31: 2500-2505Google Scholar). This placental transfer of protective IgG can be enhanced by maternal vaccination during pregnancy. For example, it is estimated that worldwide incidence rates of neonatal tetanus decreased by 75% from the years 2000 to 2013 due to the wide-scale implementation of maternal tetanus toxoid vaccination during pregnancy (Khan et al., 2015Khan R. Vandelaer J. Yakubu A. Raza A.A. Zulu F. Maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination: from protecting women and newborns to protecting all.Int. J. Womens Health. 2015; 7: 171-180Google Scholar). Yet, in 2015, despite the remarkable successes of maternal vaccination, >900,000 neonates died from vaccine-preventable respiratory infections worldwide (Liu et al., 2016Liu L. Oza S. Hogan D. Chu Y. Perin J. Zhu J. Lawn J.E. Cousens S. Mathers C. Black R.E. Global, regional, and national causes of under-5 mortality in 2000-15: an updated systematic analysis with implications for the Sustainable Development Goals.Lancet. 2016; 388: 3027-3035Google Scholar). Therefore, there is an urgent need to (1) improve the placental IgG transfer efficiency of current maternal vaccines that are routinely administered during pregnancy and (2) develop novel maternal vaccine strategies designed for optimal placental IgG transfer to combat congenital and neonatal infections. In normal pregnancies, infant cord blood IgG levels can reach levels >100% compared to those of their mothers (Kohler and Farr, 1966Kohler P.F. Farr R.S.

Several factors likely contribute to the high illness and death rates in HEU infants, including the poor placental transfer of protective maternal IgG (Adler et al., 2015Adler C. Haelterman E.

Understanding the mechanisms of impaired placental IgG transfer in HIV-infected women could also inform strategies to improve the health of HEUs. To reach the fetal circulatory system, maternal IgG must cross distinct placental cell barriers that make up the placental villous tree: the syncytiotrophoblast, the villous stroma, and fetal endothelial cells. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) plays a key role in shuttling maternal IgG across the placenta to the fetal circulatory system (Roopenian and Akilesh, 2007Roopenian D.C. Akilesh S. FcRn: the neonatal Fc receptor comes of age.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 715-725Google Scholar, Simister, 2003Simister N.E.

Human placental Fc receptors and the transmission of antibodies from mother to fetus.J. Reprod. Immunol. 1997; 37: 1-23Google Scholar). Yet, while syncytiotrophoblast cells express FcRn, neither stromal cells nor fetal endothelial cells express this canonical placental IgG shuttle receptor. Interestingly, other Fcγ receptors are also expressed in placental cells, yet their role in modulating the placental transfer of maternal protective IgG is unknown (Fouda et al., 2018Fouda G.G.

Notably, Hofbauer cells located in the villous stroma express FcγRI and FcγRIII, and fetal endothelial cells—the last cell barrier crossed by maternal IgG before reaching the fetal circulatory system—express FcγRII (Kristoffersen et al., 1990Kristoffersen E.K.

Placental transport of immunoglobulin G.Vaccine. 2003; 21: 3365-3369Google Scholar). Gaps in our understanding include how maternal IgG is transferred across this final placental cell barrier in the absence of FcRn, and whether FcγRI, FcγRII, or FcγRIII expression in placental cells contribute to the placental transfer of maternal IgG. In addition, IgG characteristics that impact Fc receptor (FcR) interactions, such as IgG subclass and/or Fc region glycans, could play a role in placental IgG transfer efficiency. The IgG subclass distribution among different antigen-specific IgG populations is distinct, and previous studies have indicated that this distribution impacts the placental transfer efficiency of different antigen-specific IgG populations (Ferrante et al., 1990Ferrante A. Beard L.J. Feldman R.G. IgG subclass distribution of antibodies to bacterial and viral antigens.Pediatr. Infect. Dis. J. 1990; 9: S16-S24Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism(s) by which placental IgG transfer is impaired in 167 HIV-infected pregnant women from the US and Malawi by identifying the determinants of placental IgG transfer. We employed multivariable linear regression modeling to examine the association between placental IgG transfer and (1) maternal HIV disease progression, (2) infant clinical factors, (3) placental factors such as FcR RNA expression, and (4) IgG Fc region characteristics including subclass, glycosylation profiles, and binding strength to placental FcRs. A deeper understanding of factors that modulate the placental transfer of maternal protective IgG will be important for extending the window of passively acquired IgG-mediated infant protection. We assessed the placental transfer of pathogen-specific IgG in two existing cohorts of HIV-infected women: the US-based Women and Infant Transmission Study (WITS) and the Malawian-based Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI) 009 study. The majority of the n = 120 US HIV infected women included in this study did not receive antiretroviral (ART) therapy during pregnancy, but ten of them (8.3%) received azidothymidine (AZT) monotherapy throughout pregnancy, and two of them (1.6%) received AZT prophylaxis at delivery (Table S1). In contrast, 100% of Malawian HIV-infected women received a single dose of nevirapine ART prophylaxis at delivery, and 13 of 47 (28%) of Malawian HIV-infected women with CD4+ T cell counts <250 (cells/mm3) received combination (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine) antiretroviral (cART) therapy throughout pregnancy. Overall, HIV-infected US women had lower plasma viral load and higher peripheral blood CD4+ T cell counts compared to HIV-infected Malawian women at delivery, despite more Malawian HIV-infected women being initiated on cART during pregnancy. We measured total plasma IgG levels in US and Malawian women as a surrogate measure of maternal hypergammaglobulinemia (Moir et al., 2001Moir S. Malaspina A. Ogwaro K.M. Donoghue E.T. Hallahan C.W. Ehler L.A. Liu S. Adelsberger J. Lapointe R. Hwu P. et al.HIV-1 induces phenotypic and functional perturbations of B cells in chronically infected individuals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 10362-10367Google Scholar). HIV-infected US women had lower total plasma IgG concentrations compared to Malawian women (median plasma IgG concentration level of 16.3 mg/mL (range 2.5–123.5 mg/mL) versus 39 mg/mL (range 8.5–158.4 mg/mL) in US versus Malawian women), with both populations having higher total plasma IgG concentrations compared to ∼10 mg/mL that is observed in normal pregnancies (Benster and Wood, 1970Benster B. Wood E.J. Immunoglobulin levels in normal pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by hypertension.J. Obstet. Gynaecol. Br. Commonw. 1970; 77: 518-522Google Scholar). All 120 infants born to the US HIV-infected women included in this study were uninfected, whereas five out of 47 (10.6%) infants born to Malawian HIV-infected women became infected with HIV in utero or peripartum (Table S1). The US HEU infants had a median gestational age of 40 weeks (range 30–43 weeks), and Malawian HEU and infected infants had a median gestational age of 39 weeks (range 33–44 weeks). There were no significant differences in infant birth weight, gestational age, or sex between the two populations. Previous studies have demonstrated that the placental transfer efficiency of maternal IgG is impaired in HIV-infected women compared to HIV-uninfected women (Dangor et al., 2015Dangor Z. Kwatra G.

Infect. Dis. 2005; 191: 1854-1860Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether antigen-specific IgG populations are uniformly poorly transferred to the fetus in the setting of maternal HIV infection. We therefore measured HIV-specific IgG antibody levels in US and Malawian paired mother-infant samples against: gp120, variable-loop 3 (V3), variable-loop 1 and 2 (V1V2), and the gp41 membrane-proximal external region (MPER). We also measured antigen-specific IgG antibody levels against common neonatal pathogens, including influenza hemagglutinin (influenza HA), pertussis toxin, tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxin, rubella virus capsid, hepatitis B (Hep B) surface antigen, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F surface antigen, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) (Figures 1A and 1B ). Both HIV and standard neonatal pathogen-specific IgG responses were detectable at similar frequencies in both US and Malawian HIV-infected women (Table S2). We observed three distinct placental transfer efficiency phenotypes, including (1) efficient placental IgG transfer across the majority of measured antigen-specific IgG, (2) poor placental IgG transfer across the majority of antigen-specific IgG, and (3) an unexpected phenotype of variable placental IgG transfer across antigen-specific IgG populations (Figures 1A and 1B). To more quantitatively define placental IgG transfer efficiency phenotypes in HIV-infected women, we generated a global placental IgG transfer score for each mother-infant pair based on the mean transfer efficiency of the measured IgG populations (Figure 1C). Using this scoring system, of 120 US HIV-infected women, 8.4%, 30.8%, and 60.8% of mother-infant pairs were defined as exhibiting efficient, poor, and variable placental IgG transfer, respectively. In contrast, of 47 Malawian HIV-infected women, 0%, 59.5%, and 40.5% mother-infant pairs were defined as exhibiting efficient, poor, and variable placental IgG transfer efficiency, respectively. We utilized the global placental IgG transfer score for US and Malawian HIV-infected women using multivariable linear regression analyses to define maternal HIV disease progression factors that are associated with placental IgG transfer efficiency. We also generated separate placental IgG transfer efficiency scores for three specific IgG populations: gp120, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis toxin-specific IgG. We utilized the antigen-specific IgG transfer score of gp120, tetanus toxoid, and pertussis toxin-specific IgG in multivariable linear regression modeling to define IgG characteristics that are important for placental transfer efficiency of these specificities. HEU infants are known to be more vulnerable to respiratory and diarrheal diseases and have higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to HIV-unexposed infants (Afran et al., 2014Afran L.

We examined the proportion of US and Malawian infants that had cord blood plasma IgG levels below the protective threshold, despite being born to HIV-infected mothers with protective levels of vaccine antigen-specific IgG. We defined protective concentration thresholds as set by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Plotkin, 2010Plotkin S.A. Correlates of protection induced by vaccination.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2010; 17: 1055-1065Google Scholar): tetanus toxoid-specific IgG (0.10 IU/mL), rubella-specific IgG (10 IU/mL), diphtheria toxin-specific IgG (0.10 IU/mL), and Hib-specific IgG (0.15 μg/mL). Of 120 US HIV-infected women, 84%, 48%, 36%, and 22% had plasma concentrations above the protective level threshold for tetanus toxoid-specific IgG, rubella-specific IgG, diphtheria-specific IgG, and Hib-specific IgG, respectively (Figure 2A). Yet, due to inefficient IgG transfer, 7%, 15%, 16%, and 40% of HEU infants born to these US HIV-infected women with protective IgG levels had concentrations below the protective threshold for tetanus toxoid-specific IgG, rubella-specific IgG, diphtheria-specific IgG, and Hib-specific IgG, respectively. Similarly, in 47 Malawian HIV-infected women, 87%, 68%, 30%, and 21% had plasma concentrations above the protective level threshold for tetanus toxoid-specific IgG, rubella-specific IgG, diphtheria-specific IgG, and Hib-specific IgG, respectively (Figure 2B). Yet, 15%, 50%, 79%, and 70% of infants born to these Malawian HIV-infected women with protective IgG levels had IgG concentrations below the protective threshold for tetanus toxoid, rubella, diphtheria, and Hib, respectively, highlighting the infant health consequences of impaired maternal IgG transfer in HIV-infected women. To determine whether the antigen-specific IgG concentration in maternal plasma was a primary factor in the distinct placental IgG transfer efficiency of both HIV and vaccine antigen-specific IgG, we first examined the association between plasma antigen-specific IgG magnitude and placental IgG transfer efficiency (Table S3). In US HIV-infected women, maternal plasma concentrations of HIV V3-specific and RSV surface F antigen-specific IgG was negatively associated with placental IgG transfer efficiency (slope: −0.24, p = 0.05; slope: −0.32, p < 0.001, respectively). In Malawian HIV-infected women, tetanus toxoid-specific IgG was positively associated with placental transfer efficiency (slope: 0.50, p < 0.004). Yet, maternal plasma antigen-specific IgG levels were not associated with placental transfer efficiency for the majority of HIV and vaccine antigen-specific IgG in both US and Malawian HIV-infected women (Table S3), indicating that other factors contribute to the efficiency of placental IgG transfer. It remains unclear how maternal HIV disease progression factors contribute to the poor placental IgG transfer observed in HIV-infected women. Maternal CD4+ T cell counts were weakly positively correlated with placental IgG transfer efficiency in US HIV-infected women (slope: 0.25, p < 0.007) but not in Malawian HIV-infected women (slope: 0.10, p = 0.47) (Figures S1A and S1B). Interestingly, maternal total plasma IgG was negatively correlated with placental IgG transfer efficiency in both US and Malawian HIV-infected women (Figures S1C and S1D).

Using convergent anatomical and functional approaches, we interrogate the contribution to fear of basal amygdala (BA) 5-HT inputs from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We show the DRN→BA 5-HT pathway is engaged during fear memory formation and retrieval, and activity of these projections facilitates fear and impairs extinction. The DRN→BA 5-HT pathway amplifies fear-associated BA neuronal firing and theta power and phase-locking. Although fear recruits 5-HT and VGluT3 co-expressing DRN neurons, the fear-potentiating influence of the DRN→BA 5-HT pathway requires signaling at BA 5-HT1A/2A receptors. Input-output mapping illustrates how the DRN→BA 5-HT pathway is anatomically distinct and connected with other brain regions that mediate fear. These findings reveal how a discrete 5-HT circuit orchestrates a broader neural network to calibrate aversive memory."
https://openalex.org/W2952817010,"Cargo trafficking along microtubules is exploited by eukaryotic viruses, but no such examples have been reported in bacteria. Several large Pseudomonas phages assemble a dynamic, tubulin-based (PhuZ) spindle that centers replicating phage DNA sequestered within a nucleus-like structure. Here, we show that capsids assemble on the membrane and then move rapidly along PhuZ filaments toward the phage nucleus for DNA packaging. The spindle rotates the phage nucleus, distributing capsids around its surface. PhuZ filaments treadmill toward the nucleus at a constant rate similar to the rate of capsid movement and the linear velocity of nucleus rotation. Capsids become trapped along mutant static PhuZ filaments that are defective in GTP hydrolysis. Our results suggest a transport and distribution mechanism in which capsids attached to the sides of filaments are trafficked to the nucleus by PhuZ polymerization at the poles, demonstrating that the phage cytoskeleton evolved cargo-trafficking capabilities in bacteria."

However, the extent to which genetic predisposition to tumor formation can be faithfully captured in stem cell lines is uncertain. Here, we evaluated neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells, representative of cerebellar progenitors. We transduced NES cells with MYCN, observing medulloblastoma upon orthotopic implantation in mice. Significantly, transcriptomes and patterns of DNA methylation from xenograft tumors were globally more representative of human medulloblastoma compared to a MYCN-driven genetically engineered mouse model. Orthotopic transplantation of NES cells generated from Gorlin syndrome patients, who are predisposed to medulloblastoma due to germline-mutated PTCH1, also generated medulloblastoma. We engineered candidate cooperating mutations in Gorlin NES cells, with mutation of DDX3X or loss of GSE1 both accelerating tumorigenesis. These findings demonstrate that human NES cells provide a potent experimental resource for dissecting genetic causation in medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2950613784,"Computational models are powerful tools for exploring the properties of complex biological systems. In neuroscience, data-driven models of neural circuits that span multiple scales are increasingly being used to understand brain function in health and disease. But their adoption and reuse has been limited by the specialist knowledge required to evaluate and use them. To address this, we have developed Open Source Brain, a platform for sharing, viewing, analyzing, and simulating standardized models from different brain regions and species. Model structure and parameters can be automatically visualized and their dynamical properties explored through browser-based simulations. Infrastructure and tools for collaborative interaction, development, and testing are also provided. We demonstrate how existing components can be reused by constructing new models of inhibition-stabilized cortical networks that match recent experimental results. These features of Open Source Brain improve the accessibility, transparency, and reproducibility of models and facilitate their reuse by the wider community."

Here we report an antibody-based conditioning protocol with reduced toxicity and enhanced specificity for robust hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation and engraftment in recipient mice. Host pre-treatment with six monoclonal antibodies targeting CD47, T cells, NK cells, and HSCs followed by donor HSC transplantation enabled stable hematopoietic system reconstitution in recipients with mismatches at half (haploidentical) or all major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. This approach allowed tolerance to heart tissue from HSC donor strains in haploidentical recipients, showing potential applications for solid organ transplantation without immune suppression. Fully mismatched chimeric mice developed antibody responses to nominal antigens, showing preserved functional immunity. These findings suggest approaches for transplanting immunologically mismatched HSCs and solid organs with limited toxicity."

In this paper we apply these technologies, along with machine learning, to the mapping of peatlands–a landcover class that is critical for preserving biodiversity, helping to address climate change impacts, and providing ecosystem services, e.g., carbon storage–in the Boreal Forest Natural Region of Alberta, Canada. We outline a data-driven, scientific framework that: compiles large amounts of Earth observation data sets (radar, optical, and LiDAR); examines the extracted variables for suitability in peatland modelling; optimizes model parameterization; and finally, predicts peatland occurrence across a large boreal area (397, 958 km2) of Alberta at 10 m spatial resolution (equalling 3.9 billion pixels across Alberta). The resulting peatland occurrence model shows an accuracy of 87% and a kappa statistic of 0.57 when compared to our validation data set. Differentiating peatlands from mineral wetlands achieved an accuracy of 69% and kappa statistic of 0.37. This data-driven approach is applicable at large geopolitical scales (e.g., provincial, national) for wetland and landcover inventories that support long-term, responsible resource management."

The leukocytic response is a pre-fertilization event in which sperm trigger an immune response that promotes homing of circulating leukocytes to the uterine lumen to destroy most sperm. Various glycoconjugates decorate the sperm surface, including sialic acids, which are abundant at the sperm surface where they cap most glycan chains and regulate sperm migration through cervical mucus, formation of the sperm oviductal reservoir, and sperm capacitation. However, the role of sperm-associated sialic acids in the leukocytic reaction remains unknown. The cognate endogenous binding partners of sialic acids, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) play a pivotal role in regulating many immune responses. Here we investigated whether sperm-associated sialic acids inhibit activation of neutrophils, one of the major immune cells involved in the leukocytic reaction. We used in vitro interactions between sperm and neutrophils as well as binding assays between sperm and recombinant Siglec-Fc chimeric proteins to measure interactions. Moreover, we examined whether Siglecs are expressed on human and mouse endometria, which have a role in initiating the leukocytic reaction. Surprisingly less sialylated, capacitated, sperm did not increase neutrophil activation in vitro. However, we observed expression of several Siglecs on the endometrium and that these receptors interact with sialylated sperm. Our results indicate that sperm sialic acids may interact with endometrial Siglecs and that these interactions facilitate sperm survival in the face of female immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2951821593,"The feeding ecology of gray wolves has been investigated extensively worldwide. Despite previous studies on food habits of wolves in Asia and Iran, none has focused on the diet of the species in a scenario of depleted of wild prey and with recent records of attacks on humans. Here, we combined telemetry methods and scat analysis to study the diet of wolves in areas of Hamadan province, Iran, where medium to large wild prey is almost absent. Between October 2015 and March 2017, we studied the feeding behavior (by identifying feeding sites through clusters of GPS locations) of three wolves fitted with GPS collars, belonging to different wolf packs. We also collected and analyzed 110 wolf scats during the same period within the same areas. Overall, we investigated 850 clusters of GPS locations in the field, and identified 312 feeding sites. Most feeding clusters were linked to dumpsites and poultry farms around villages. We found 142 and 170 events of predatory (kill sites) and scavenging behavior, respectively. Prey composition based on kill sites was comprised of 74.6% livestock, 19.7% lagomorphs, 3.5% dogs, 1.4% red fox, and 0.7% golden jackal. Similarly, prey composition based on scavenging clusters was comprised of 79.9% livestock, 10.6% red fox, and 9.4% golden jackal. Scat analysis, however, indicated that livestock (34.3%), garbage (23.7%), poultry (16.0%), and European hare (15.4%) were the most frequent food items. We discuss the role of anthropogenic food sources in a context where agonistic wolf-human encounters occur recurrently, and suggest management guidelines regarding illegal dumping of animal carcasses and garbage dumpsites, in order to minimize wolf-human negative interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2950122676,"Canine urothelial carcinoma (cUC) is the most common tumor of the lower urinary tract in dogs. Although chemotherapy and radical surgery have improved the overall survival, most dogs with cUC succumb to metastasis or recurrence. Therefore, the development of an effective systematic therapy is warranted. In this study, a comprehensive drug screening test using a cUC cell line was performed and the anti-tumor effect of a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor was evaluated. Comprehensive drug screening was performed on cUC cells. Based on this screening, the anti-proliferation effect of vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor clinically applied in humans, was evaluated using several cUC cell lines in sulforhodamine B and flow cytometry assays. Western blot analysis was also performed to evaluate the degree of acetylation of histone H3 as well as the expression and phosphorylation of cell cycle-related molecules. The anti-tumor effect of vorinostat in vivo was evaluated using a xenograft model. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed on acetyl-histone H3 in cUC and the relationship between the degree of acetylation and prognosis was examined using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Drug screening revealed that HDAC inhibitors consistently inhibited the growth of cUC cells. Vorinostat inhibited the growth of 6 cUC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Western blot analysis showed that vorinostat mediated the acetylation of histone H3, the dephosphorylation of p-Rb, and the upregulation of p21 upon exposure to vorinostat. Furthermore, inhibition of tumor growth was observed in the xenograft model. In clinical cUC cases, neoplastic urothelium showed significant deacetylation of histones compared to the normal control, where lower histone acetylation levels were associated with a poor prognosis. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of vorinostat was demonstrated in cUC. Histone deacetylation may be related to cUC tumor progression."

Methods Ten under 23 road cyclists completed two separate testing sessions during which they performed two different cognitive tasks before completing a 30-min time trial on the cycle ergometer. In the experimental condition, 30 min of a standard cognitive task (Stroop task) was used to elicit mental fatigue; in the control condition, a non-demanding activity was carried out. Subjective workload and mood were measured before and after the treatments, and motivation was recorded before the time-trial. During the time trial, power, cadence, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion were assessed. Blood lactate concentrations and heart rate variability (using the root mean square of the successive differences) were measured before and after the time trial. Results The Stroop task was rated more mentally (P < 0.001) and temporally (P < 0.001) demanding, effortful (P < 0.001), and frustrating (P = 0.001) than the control task; fatigue (P = 0.002) and vigor (P = 0.018) after the cognitive tasks were respectively higher and lower than in the control task. Mean power output (P = 0.007) and cadence (P = 0.043) were negatively affected by the Stroop task, while heart rate (P = 0.349), rating of perceived exertion (P = 0.710), blood lactate concentration (P = 0.850), and root mean square of the successive differences (P = 0.355) did not differ between the two conditions. Conclusion A mentally demanding activity reduced the subsequent physical performance in sub-elite under 23 cyclists. Thus, avoiding cognitive efforts before training and races could improve performance of high-level athletes."

However, the consequence of and response to long-term hypercholanemia caused by NTCP deficiency remain largely unexplored. Here, we analyzed lifelong dynamics of serum total bile acid (TBA) levels in Slc10a1−/− mice, and we also assessed changes of TBA levels in 33 young individuals with SLC10A1 loss-of-function variant p.Ser267Phe. We found that overall serum TBA levels tended to decrease gradually with age in both Slc10a1−/− mice and p.Ser267Phe individuals. Liver mRNA profiling revealed notable transcription alterations in hypercholanemic Slc10a1−/− mice, including inhibition of bile acid (BA) synthesis, enhancement of BA detoxification, and altered BA transport. Members of the sulfotransferase (SULT) family showed the most dramatic increases in livers of hypercholanemic Slc10a1−/− mice, and one of their BA sulfates, taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate, significantly increased. Importantly, consistent with the mouse studies, comprehensive profiling of 58 BA species in sera of p.Ser267Phe individuals revealed a markedly increased level of BA sulfates.

However, DNA with high G+C content can be unstable in many host organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report the development of Sinorhizobium meliloti, a nitrogen-fixing plant symbioticα-Proteobacterium, as a novel host that can store DNA, and mobilize DNA to E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and the eukaryotic microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum. To achieve this, we deleted the hsdR restriction-system in multiple reduced genome strains of S. meliloti that enable DNA transformation with up to 1.4 x 105 and 2.1 x 103 CFU μg-1 of DNA efficiency using electroporation and a newly developed polyethylene glycol transformation method, respectively. Multi-host and multi-functional shuttle vectors (MHS) were constructed and stably propagated in S. meliloti, E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and P. tricornutum. We also developed protocols and demonstrated direct transfer of these MHS vectors via conjugation from S. meliloti to E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and P. tricornutum. The development of S. meliloti as a new host for inter-kingdom DNA transfer will be invaluable for synthetic biology research and applications, including the installation and study of genes and biosynthetic pathways into organisms of interest in industry and agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2950368229,"The interaction between atherosclerosis and commensal microbes through leaky gut syndrome (LGS), which is characterized by impaired intestinal permeability and the introduction of undesired pathogens into the body, has not been fully elucidated. Our aim was to investigate the potential role of a ClC-2 chloride channel activator, lubiprostone, which is reported to have beneficial effects on LGS, in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E–deficient (ApoE-/-) mice. After a 15-week feeding period of a Western diet (WD), ApoE-/- mice were treated with a Western-type diet (WD) alone or WD with oral supplementation of lubiprostone for 10 weeks. This feeding protocol was followed by experimental evaluation of LGS and atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta. In mice with lubiprostone, in vivo translocation of orally administered 4-kDa FITC-dextran was significantly improved, and RNA expression of the epithelial tight junction proteins, Zo-1 and occludin, was significantly up-regulated in the ileum, compared to the WD alone group, suggesting a possible reversal of WD-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. As a result, WD-induced exacerbation of atherosclerotic lesion formation was reduced by 69% in longitudinally opened aortas and 26% in aortic root regions. In addition, there was a significant decrease in circulating immunoglobulin level, followed by an attenuation of inflammatory responses in the perivascular adipose tissue, as evidenced by reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lubiprostone attenuates atherosclerosis by ameliorating LGS-induced inflammation through the restoration of the intestinal barrier. These findings raise the possibility of targeting LGS for the treatment of atherosclerosis."

Here we present a new technique that leverages fish otoliths in reef sediments to reconstruct coral reef fish communities. We found over 5,400 otoliths in 169 modern and mid-Holocene bulk samples from Caribbean Panama and Dominican Republic mid-Holocene and modern reefs, demonstrating otoliths are abundant in reef sediments. With a specially-built reference collection, we were able to assign over 4,400 otoliths to one of 56 taxa (35 families) though mostly at genus and family level. Many otoliths were from juvenile fishes for which identification is challenging. Richness (by rarefaction) of otolith assemblages was slightly higher in modern than mid-Holocene reefs, but further analyses are required to elucidate the underlying causes. We compared the living fish communities, sampled using icthyocide, with the sediment otolith assemblages on four reefs finding the otolith assemblages faithfully capture the general composition of the living fish communities. Radiocarbon dating performed directly on the otoliths suggests that relatively little mixing of sediment layers particularly on actively accreting branching coral reefs. All otolith assemblages were strongly dominated by small, fast-turnover fish taxa and juvenile individuals, and our exploration on taxonomy, functional ecology and taphonomy lead us to the conclusion that intense predation is likely the most important process for otolith accumulation in reef sediments. We conclude that otolith assemblages in modern and fossil reef sediments can provide a powerful tool to explore ecological changes in reef fish communities over time and space."
https://openalex.org/W2952464875,"Hallmark of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the primary, genetic degeneration of rods followed by secondary loss of cones, caused by still elusive biologic mechanisms. We previously shown that exposure of rd10 mutant mice, modeling autosomal recessive RP, to environmental enrichment (EE), with enhanced motor, sensorial and social stimuli, results into a sensible delay of retinal degeneration and vision loss. Searching for effectors of EE-mediated retinal protection, we performed transcriptome analysis of the retina of rd10 enriched and control mice and found that gene expression at the peaks of rod and cone degeneration is characterized by a strong inflammatory/immune response, which is however measurably lower in enrichment conditions. Treating rd10 mice with dexamethasone during the period of maximum photoreceptors death lowered retinal inflammation and caused a preservation of cones and cone-mediated vision. Our findings indicate a link between retinal inflammation and bystander cone degeneration, reinforcing the notion that cone vision in RP can be preserved using anti-inflammatory approaches.—Guadagni, V., Biagioni, M., Novelli, E., Aretini, P., Mazzanti, C.

As with all survey techniques, it is crucial to conduct camera trapping research following study designs that include adequate spatial and temporal replication, and sufficient probability of detecting species presence. The use and configuration of multiple camera traps within a single survey site are understudied considerations that could have a substantial impact on detection probability. Our objective was to test the role that camera number (one, two or three units), and spacing along a linear transect (100 m or 150 m), have on the probability of detecting a species given it is present. From January to March, 2017 we collected data on six mammal species in Maine, USA: coyote (Canis latrans), fisher (Pekania pennanti), American marten (Martes americana), short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We used multi-scale occupancy modelling to compare pooled detection histories of different configuration of five cameras deployed at the same survey site (n = 32), and how the configuration would influence the probability of detecting a species given it was available at the site. Across all six species, we found substantial increases in probability of detection as the number of cameras increased from one to two (22 to 400 percent increase), regardless of the spacing between cameras. For most species the magnitude of the increase was less substantial when adding a third camera (4 to 85 percent increase), with coyote and snowshoe hare showing a pronounced effect. The influence of survey station features also varied by species. We suggest that using pooled data from two or three cameras at a survey site is a cost effective approach to increase detection success over a single camera."

Exposure to them can cause cognitive impairment and depressive disorders through an effect on Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is an important biomarker of pregnancy. Despite a number of prior studies on heavy metals pollution, there is few of studies on the effect of heavy metals on BDNF during early pregnancy. This study aims to examine the association between maternal blood heavy metals concentrations and BDNF during the first trimester pregnancy among Myanmar migrants in Thailand.This cross sectional study, a part of ongoing birth cohort was conducted at the antenatal care clinic from June to October 2018. A total of 108 with Myanmar migrant pregnancy with a single viable fetus of 0 to 14 gestation weeks who stayed within the industrial plant at least 3 months before were recruited. Socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviors were accessed using a self-report questionnaire. Maternal blood heavy metals (lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As)) were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and plasma BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate binary logistic regression were modeled to access the association.Median (interquartile rank: IQR) concentrations were: BDNF (6.49 (1.79) μg/ml), Pb (2.77 (1.46) μg/dL), Hg (0.62 (0.54) μg/dL), Cd (0.93(0.86) μg/L) and As (0.40 (0.11) μg/dL) respectively. We categorized BDNF concentrations into high (> median) (n = 54) and low (≤ median) (n = 54) groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, high blood total arsenic concentration had 2.6-fold increased odds (aOR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.178, 5.751) of low plasma BDNF level as compared with low blood total arsenic group. However, there was no significant association between BDNF and Pb, Hg and Cd.The present findings demonstrate higher blood total arsenic level were more likely to have lower BDNF in early pregnancy. Our study suggested that heavy metal could be worsen BDNF level which plays its important role on biological effect of maternal depressive disorder and newborn neurodevelopment."

Nutritional supplements could improve physical fitness by modulating energy metabolism, oxidative processes, and perceived fatigue. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological and biochemical changes induced by submaximal exercise on drug detection dogs (German Shepherd breed) and to assess whether a dietary supplement improves their physical fitness. During a drug detection dog training course, seven dogs were fed with a basal diet (Control Group) for three-month period, while a further seven dogs were fed with a basal diet as well as a daily nutritional supplement containing branched-chain and limiting amino acids, carnitine, vitamins, and octacosanol (Treatment Group). At the end of this period, individual physical fitness was assessed by making each subject take a graded treadmill exercise test. A human heart rate monitor system was used to record the dog's heart rate (HR) during the treadmill exercise and the subsequent recovery period. The parameters related to HR were analysed using nonparametric statistics. Blood samples were collected before starting the nutritional supplement treatment, before and after the treadmill exercise and following recovery. Linear mixed models were used. The dietary supplements accelerated HR recovery, as demonstrated by the lower HR after recovery (P<0.05) and Time constants of HR decay (P<0.05), and by the higher Absolute HR Recovered (P<0.05) recorded in the Treatment group compared with the Control dogs. The supplemented dogs showed the lowest concentrations of creatine kinase (CK; P<0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, P<0.05) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA; P<0.01) suggesting a reduction in muscle damage and improvement of energy metabolism. These data suggest that this combined supplement can significantly enhance the physical fitness of drug detection dogs."

This study investigated the effect of a multi-component breastfeeding support intervention delivered in hospital and home settings on six-month exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) relative to standard care. Methods This is a parallel group, randomized clinical trial, in which 362 healthy pregnant women with singleton pregnancy were randomly allocated to a multi-component intervention that included antenatal breastfeeding education, professional, and peer support, delivered in hospital and home settings for six months (experimental, n = 174), or to standard care (control, n = 188). The primary outcome was six-month EBF rate. Secondary outcomes were exclusive and any breastfeeding rates at one and three months, maternal breastfeeding knowledge, attitude, and behavior at six months, and satisfaction with the intervention. Results The crude six-month EBF rate was similar in both groups (35.2% vs. 28.1% in the experimental and control groups, respectively, p = 0·16). In adjusted analysis, six-month exclusivity was twice as likely in the experimental group relative to standard care (OR = 2.02; 95%CI: 1.20 to 3.39); whereas the odds for any breastfeeding were similar. Participants compliant with all three components were six times more likely to practice EBF for six months relative to standard care (OR = 6.63; 95% CI: 3.03 to 14.51). Breastfeeding knowledge of the experimental group, at six months, was significantly improved compared to the control. No changes were observed in breastfeeding attitude or behavior. Conclusions Combining education with peer and professional breastfeeding support improved six-month breastfeeding exclusivity and knowledge."

We evaluated and compared long-term effects of microbiota status and metabolic profiles in early colorectal cancer (CRC) patients after curative colectomy to the controls. In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed metabolic syndrome occurrence in 165 patients after curative partial colectomy with right hemicolectomy (RH) or low anterior resection (LAR) and 333 age-sex matched controls. Fecal samples from some of those with RH, LAR, and controls were analyzed by next-generation sequencing method. The occurrences of metabolic syndrome were significantly higher in patients after RH, but not LAR, when compared with the controls over the long term (> 5 years) follow-up (P = 0.020). Compared with control group, RH group showed lower bacterial diversity (P = 0.007), whereas LAR group showed significantly higher bacterial diversity at the genera level (P = 0.016). Compared with the control group, the principal component analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial genera abundance after RH and LAR (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio was significantly lower in the RH group than the control group (22.0% versus 49.4%, P < 0.05). In conclusion, early CRC patients after RH but not LAR were associated with a higher occurrence of metabolic syndrome than the controls during long-term follow-up. In parallel with metabolic change, patients with RH showed dysbiosis with a tendency to decreased richness and a significant decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota."

Oxidative stress suppresses KLOTHO expression in renal epithelial cells but upregulates microRNA-200c (miR-200c) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated whether oxidative stress-induced miR-200c is implicated in KLOTHO downregulation in human renal tubular epithelium (HK-2) cells. HK-2 cells were stimulated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to examine the effect of oxidative stress. A luciferase reporter containing the KLOTHO 3′-UTR was used to investigate the effect of miR-200c on KLOTHO mRNA metabolism. The expressions of KLOTHO, oxidative stress markers, and miR-200c were determined in human kidney biopsy specimens. H2O2 suppressed KLOTHO expression without a reduction in KLOTHO mRNA levels but upregulated miR-200c expression. Similarly, transfection of a miR-200c mimic reduced KLOTHO levels and luciferase activity without a reduction in KLOTHO mRNA levels. In contrast, transfection of a miR-200c inhibitor maintained KLOTHO expression. Immunofluorescent assay revealed KLOTHO was present in the cytosol and nuclei of HK-2 cells. In human kidney biopsies, KLOTHO expression was inversely correlated with levels of oxidative stress markers (8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine: ρ = −0.38, P = 0.026; 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal: ρ = −0.35, P = 0.038) and miR-200c (ρ = −0.34, P = 0.043). Oxidative stress-induced miR-200c binds to the KLOTHO mRNA 3′-UTR, resulting in reduced KLOTHO expression."
https://openalex.org/W2949756683,"The ion pump Na+, K+–ATPase (NKA) is a receptor for the cardiotonic steroid ouabain. Subsaturating concentration of ouabain triggers intracellular calcium oscillations, stimulates cell proliferation and adhesion, and protects from apoptosis. However, it is controversial whether ouabain-bound NKA is considered a signal transducer. To address this question, we performed a global analysis of protein phosphorylation in COS-7 cells, identifying 2580 regulated phosphorylation events on 1242 proteins upon 10- and 20-min treatment with ouabain. Regulated phosphorylated proteins include the inositol triphosphate receptor and stromal interaction molecule, which are essential for initiating calcium oscillations. Hierarchical clustering revealed that ouabain triggers a structured phosphorylation response that occurs in a well-defined, time-dependent manner and affects specific cellular processes, including cell proliferation and cell-cell junctions. We additionally identify regulation of the phosphorylation of several calcium and calmodulin–dependent protein kinases (CAMKs), including 2 sites of CAMK type II-γ (CAMK2G), a protein known to regulate apoptosis. To verify the significance of this result, CAMK2G was knocked down in primary kidney cells. CAMK2G knockdown impaired ouabain-dependent protection from apoptosis upon treatment with high glucose or serum deprivation. In conclusion, we establish NKA as the coordinator of a broad, tightly regulated phosphorylation response in cells and define CAMK2G as a downstream effector of NKA.—Panizza, E., Zhang, L., Fontana, J.

https://openalex.org/W2949873958,"The cardiac mechanosensitive BK (Slo1) channels are gated by Ca2+, voltage, and membrane stretch. The neuropeptide GsMTx4 is a selective inhibitor of mechanosensitive (MS) channels. It has been reported to suppress stretch-induced cardiac fibrillation in the heart, but the mechanism underlying the specificity and even the targeting channel(s) in the heart remain elusive. Here, we report that GsMTx4 inhibits a stretch-activated BK channel (SAKcaC) in the heart through a modulation specific to mechano-gating. We show that membrane stretching increases while GsMTx4 decreases the open probability (Po) of SAKcaC. These effects were mostly abolished by the deletion of the STREX axis-regulated (STREX) exon located between RCK1 and RCK2 domains in BK channels. Single-channel kinetics analysis revealed that membrane stretch activates SAKcaC by prolonging the open-time duration (τO) and shortening the closed-time constant (τC). In contrast, GsMTx4 reversed the effects of membrane stretch, suggesting that GsMTx4 inhibits SAKcaC activity by interfering with mechano-gating of the channel. Moreover, GsMTx4 exerted stronger efficacy on SAKcaC under membrane-hyperpolarized/resting conditions. Molecular dynamics simulation study revealed that GsMTx4 appeared to have the ability to penetrate deeply within the bilayer, thus generating strong membrane deformation under the hyperpolarizing/resting conditions. Immunostaining results indicate that BK variants containing STREX are also expressed in mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes. Our results provide common mechanisms of peptide actions on MS channels and may give clues to therapeutic suppression of cardiac arrhythmias caused by excitatory currents through MS channels under hyper-mechanical stress in the heart."
https://openalex.org/W2950699931,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial and serious life-threatening infections and infections caused by this bacterium continue to pose a major medical challenge worldwide. The ability of P. aeruginosa to produce multiple virulence factors and in particular to form biofilms makes this bacterium resistant to all known antibiotics. As a consequence, standard antibiotic therapy are increasingly become ineffective to clear such infections associated with biofilms. In search for novel effective agents to combat P. aeruginosa biofilm infections, a series of the BmKn‒2 scorpion venom peptide and its truncated derivatives were synthesized and their antibiofilm activities assessed. Among the peptides tested, BmKn‒22 peptide, which was a modified peptide of the parental BmKn‒2 scorpion venom peptide, clearly demonstrated the most potential inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms without affecting the bacterial growth. This peptide was not only capable of inhibiting the formation of P. aeruginosa biofilms, but also disrupting the established biofilms of P. aeruginosa. Additionally, BmKn‒22 peptide was able to inhibit the production of key virulence factor pyocyanin of P. aeruginosa. Our results also showed that BmKn‒22 peptide significantly reduced lasI and rhlR expression, and suggested that BmKn‒22 peptide-mediated inhibition of P. aeruginosa biofilms and virulence factors was achieved through the components of quorum-sensing systems. Combination of BmKn‒22 peptide with azithromycin resulted in a remarkable reduction P. aeruginosa biofilms. Since this peptide exhibited low toxicity to mammalian cells, all our results therefore indicate that the BmKn‒22 peptide is a promising antibiofilm agent against P. aeruginosa and warrant further development of this peptide as a novel therapeutic for treatment of P. aeruginosa‒associated biofilm infections."
https://openalex.org/W2952903089,"Feedback of potentially serious incidental findings (PSIFs) to imaging research participants generates clinical assessment in most cases. Understanding the factors associated with increased risks of PSIFs and of serious final diagnoses may influence individuals' decisions to participate in imaging research and will inform the design of PSIFs protocols for future research studies. We aimed to determine whether, and to what extent, socio-demographic, lifestyle, other health-related factors and PSIFs protocol are associated with detection of both a PSIF and a final diagnosis of serious disease.Our cohort consisted of all UK Biobank participants who underwent imaging up to December 2015 (n = 7334, median age 63, 51.9% women). Brain, cardiac and body magnetic resonance, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry images from the first 1000 participants were reviewed systematically by radiologists for PSIFs. Thereafter, radiographers flagged concerning images for radiologists' review. We classified final diagnoses as serious or not using data from participant surveys and clinical correspondence from GPs up to six months following imaging (either participant or GP correspondence, or both, were available for 93% of participants with PSIFs). We used binomial logistic regression models to investigate associations between age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation, private healthcare use, alcohol intake, diet, physical activity, smoking, body mass index and morbidity, with both PSIFs and serious final diagnoses. Systematic radiologist review generated 13 times more PSIFs than radiographer flagging (179/1000 [17.9%] versus 104/6334 [1.6%]; age- and sex-adjusted OR 13.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.3-17.1] p<0.001) and proportionally fewer serious final diagnoses (21/179 [11.7%]; 33/104 [31.7%]). Risks of both PSIFs and of serious final diagnoses increased with age (sex-adjusted ORs [95% CI] for oldest [67-79 years] versus youngest [44-58 years] participants for PSIFs and serious final diagnoses respectively: 1.59 [1.07-2.38] and 2.79 [0.86 to 9.0] for systematic radiologist review; 1.88 [1.14-3.09] and 2.99 [1.09-8.19] for radiographer flagging). No other factor was significantly associated with either PSIFs or serious final diagnoses. Our study is the largest so far to investigate the factors associated with PSIFs and serious final diagnoses, but despite this, we still may have missed some associations due to sparsity of these outcomes within our cohort and small numbers within some exposure categories.Risks of PSIFs and serious final diagnosis are substantially influenced by PSIFs protocol and to a lesser extent by age. As only 1/5 PSIFs represent serious disease, evidence-based PSIFs protocols are paramount to minimise over-investigation of healthy research participants and diversion of limited health services away from patients in need."

Moreover, hGMPK has been assigned a critical role in metabolic activation of antiviral and antineoplastic nucleoside-analog prodrugs. Given that hGMPK is indispensable for producing the nucleotide building blocks of DNA, RNA, and cGMP and that cancer cells possess elevated GTP levels, it is surprising that a detailed structural and functional characterization of hGMPK is lacking. Here, we present the first high-resolution structure of hGMPK in the apo form, determined with NMR spectroscopy. The structure revealed that hGMPK consists of three distinct regions designated as the LID, GMP-binding (GMP-BD), and CORE domains and is in an open configuration that is nucleotide binding–competent. We also demonstrate that nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) of the hGMPK CORE domain distant from the nucleotide-binding site of this domain modulate enzymatic activity without significantly affecting hGMPK's structure. Finally, we show that knocking down the hGMPK gene in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines decreases cellular viability, proliferation, and clonogenic potential while not altering the proliferation of immortalized, noncancerous human peripheral airway cells. Taken together, our results provide an important step toward establishing hGMPK as a potential biomolecular target, from both an orthosteric (ligand-binding sites) and allosteric (location of CORE domain-located nsSNVs) standpoint.

Recently, a small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) study on hGMPK presented the first reported structural data on hGMPK demonstrating that ligand binding leads to a compaction of hGMPK by about 2 Å (34Jain R.

To further investigate the relationship between hGMPK structure and function with more detail, we solved the first high-resolution structure of hGMPK with solution NMR spectroscopy, which is also the first structure with atomic-level resolution of a nucleotide-free mammalian GMPK. A comparison of our hGMPK NMR structure with the yeast and mouse GMPK X-ray structures revealed a conserved structural fold as well as a large-scale interdomain motion associated with nucleotide binding. In addition to solving the hGMPK structure, we explored the impact of active-site distant, nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) on hGMPK's structure and function. We found that CORE domain nsSNVs of hGMPK alter catalytic activity without significantly perturbing the average structure of the apo-enzyme. Finally, we present the first study demonstrating that intracellular inhibition of hGMPK may represent a novel approach to chemotherapy. We solved the solution structure of hGMPK using our previously published chemical shift assignment and our measured 15N-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (60-ms mixing time), 13Caliphatic-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (80 ms mixing time), and 13Caromatic-resolved 1H,1H NOESY (80-ms mixing time) spectra (35Khan N.

As a supplement to these data, we measured backbone 15N heteronuclear NOEs (15N-hetNOEs) and a set of residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) (Fig. 3 and Table S1). The 15N-hetNOE data enabled us to justify removal of dihedral angle and RDC constraints for flexible residues with 15N-hetNOE values lower than 0.70 from the structure calculation.Figure 3Plot of the steady state heteronuclear [1H]-15N NOE data (black) and the per residue RMSD (red) for hGMPK.

Open table in a new tab We proceeded to ascertain the location of structural domains within the hGMPK structure. For this purpose, we utilized the program HingeProt (41Emekli U. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Wolfson H.J. Nussinov R. Haliloglu T. HingeProt: automated prediction of hinges in protein structures.Proteins. 2008; 70 (17847101): 1219-122710.1002/prot.21613Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which identified 4 hinge residues within the hGMPK structure: Ser-35, Ala-87, Pro-124, and Glu-157. Based on this result, we defined three distinct structural domains: domain 1, spanning residues 1–34, 88–123, and 158–197; domain 2, spanning residues 36–86; and domain 3, spanning residues 125–156 (Fig. 2). In support of the HingeProt results, the measured 15N-hetNOEs preceding and following the hinge residues show lower than average values that signify more flexibility in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale (Fig. 3). These hinge residues are similar to what was previously inferred from a comparison of the GMP + ADP–bound mouse GMPK (mGMPK; 1LVG) X-ray structure with the apo- and GMP-bound yeast GMPK (yGMPK; 1EX6 and 1EX7, respectively) X-ray structures: hinge 1, residues 32–36; hinge 2, residues 90–96; hinge 3, residues 124–125; and hinge 4, residues 157–164 (26Sekulic N.

Interestingly, mutating Ser-35 to proline has been shown to significantly reduce catalytic activity by preventing closure of the GMP-binding domain (GMP-BD) (42Johnston C.A. Whitney D.S. Volkman B.F. Doe C.Q. Prehoda K.E. Conversion of the enzyme guanylate kinase into a mitotic-spindle orienting protein by a single mutation that inhibits GMP-induced closing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The three domains described here are very similar to the domains identified from nonhuman GMPKs. Namely, domains 1, 2, and 3 have been defined previously as the central CORE domain, the GMP-BD, and the LID domain (this domain's name refers to how it closes like a lid onto the CORE domain during catalysis), respectively, nomenclature that we will utilize for our hGMPK structure. The sequence arrangement of the regular secondary structure elements is β1-α1-β2-β3-β4-α2-β5-β6-α3-β7-α4-β8-α5-α6-β9-α7-α8 (Fig. 2A; see Fig. S1 for a schematic plot of the short-range NOE connections). Within the CORE domain, a four-stranded twisted parallel β-sheet consisting of β9-β8-β1-β7 is situated in between the helices α1, α7, and α8 on one side and α4 and a portion of α6 from the LID domain on the other side. The canonical P-loop motif (11GXXXXGK(T/S)18), involved in ATP binding, bridges β1 and α1, whereas β2 connects the CORE domain to the GMP-BD and is oriented slightly perpendicular to the central parallel β-sheet. A dense network of hydrophobic contacts is present in the region between α1-α7-α8 and β9-β8-β1-β7-β2 involving residues Val-7 and Leu-9 from β1; Lys-17, Leu-21, Leu-24, and Leu-25 from α1; Phe-32 from β2; Ile-97 and Val-99 from β7; Ile-118, Ile-120, and Val-122 from β8; Val-167 and Ile-169 from β9; Ala-177, Leu-181, and Ala-184 from α7; Leu-185 in between α7 and α8; and Glu-188, Ile-189, and Ala-192 from α8 (Fig. S2). The GMP-BD consists of a twisted antiparallel sheet involving strands β3-β5-β6 with β4 oriented parallel to β3 and α2 bridging β4 and β5. A long loop spanning residues 40–52 connects β3 and β4. Joining the GMP-BD back to the CORE is α3, which possesses the hinge residue Ala-87. Finally, the LID domain consists of two α-helices, α5 and α6, that are connected by a flexible loop. The higher RMSDs for residues within this LID domain loop are supported by the corresponding 15N-hetNOE values, especially for residues 137–142 (Fig. 3 and Table S1), although it should be noted that dihedral angle and RDC constraints were removed from the structure calculation for these residues due to low 15N-hetNOEs values. The electrostatic charge distribution of hGMPK indicates that nucleotide binding is mediated by electrostatic interactions (Fig. 4). A highly positive patch positioned between the LID domain and the P-loop from the CORE domain includes residues that have been shown to coordinate ATP in the X-ray structure of mGMPK (Figs. S3 and S4). As for GMP binding, both a positive (GMP-BD) and negative patch (GMP-BD and CORE) encompass residues that interact with the phosphate group and the guanine base, respectively. In fact, the orientation of the side chains involved in coordinating both GMP and ATP are very similar between the human and mouse structures (Fig. S3), supporting the importance of these electrostatic patches for hGMPK function. Next, we then compared the domain orientations from our hGMPK NMR structure with the yGMPK and mGMPK X-ray structures (Fig. 5). For the structural comparison, we utilized multiple sequence alignment to select the same residues from each species (Fig. S4 and Table S2). It should be noted that hGMPK and mGMPK share 88% sequence identity, equating to a total of 24 of 197 different residues; however, the orientations of the different side chains remain relatively similar (Fig. S5). The main structural differences related to these residue substitutions, aside from the N and C termini, are primarily located around the hinge regions, namely G30S, V86E, and Q89R, where domain movement has been shown to be associated with function (see below). An interesting exception is L25F within the center of α1, with the leucine side chain pointing away from the interior of hGMPK, whereas the phenylalanine side chain of mGMPK points inward (Fig. S5). Immediately apparent from the hGMPK, yGMPK, and mGMPK structural bundle is the orientation of the GMP-BD (Fig. 5A). With ligands bound, the GMP-BD is positioned closer to the LID domain, as evident by the d"

The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of respiration-rate (RR) and tidal-volume (TV) estimation algorithms, from body-surface ECG signals, using a smartphone based ambulatory respiration monitoring system (cvrPhone). Methods Twelve lead ECG signals were collected using the cvrPhone from anesthetized and mechanically ventilated swine (n = 9). During ECG data acquisition, the mechanical ventilator tidal-volume (TV) was varied from 250 to 0 to 750 to 0 to 500 to 0 to 750 ml at respiratory rates (RR) of 6 and 14 breaths/min, respectively, and the RR and TV values were estimated from the ECG signals using custom algorithms. Results TV estimations from any two different TV settings showed statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) regardless of the RR. RRs were estimated to be 6.1±1.1 and 14.0±0.2 breaths/min at 6 and 14 breaths/min, respectively (when 250, 500 and 750 ml TV settings were combined). During apnea, the estimated TV and RR values were 11.7±54.9 ml and 0.0±3.5 breaths/min, which were significantly different (p<0.05) than TV and RR values during non-apnea breathing. In addition, the time delay from the apnea onset to the first apnea detection was 8.6±6.7 and 7.0±3.2 seconds for TV and RR respectively. Conclusions We have demonstrated that apnea can reliably be detected using ECG-derived RR and TV algorithms. These results support the concept that our algorithms can be utilized to detect SA in conjunction with ECG monitoring."

Fertilization directly results in Ca2+ oscillations, but the resultant pattern of CaMKII activity remains largely unclear. To address this gap, we first employed the one existing biosensor for CaMKII activation. This sensor, Camui, comprises CaMKIIα and therefore solely reports on the activation of this CaMKII variant. Additionally, to detect the activity of all endogenous CaMKII variants simultaneously, we constructed a substrate-based sensor for CaMKII activity, FRESCA (FRET-based sensor for CaMKII activity). To examine the differential responses of the Camui and FRESCA sensors, we used several approaches to stimulate Ca2+ release in mouse eggs, including addition of phospholipase Cζ cRNA, which mimics natural fertilization. We found that the Camui response is delayed or terminates earlier than the FRESCA response. FRESCA enables assessment of endogenous CaMKII activity in real-time by both fertilization and artificial reagents, such as Sr2+, which also leads to CaMKII activation. FRESCA's broad utility will be important for optimizing artificial CaMKII activation for clinical use to manage infertility. Moreover, FRESCA provides a new view on CaMKII activity, and its application in additional biological systems may reveal new signaling paradigms in eggs, as well as in neurons, cardiomyocytes, immune cells, and other CaMKII-expressing cells.

https://openalex.org/W2951453343,"Cordycepin is an efficient component of Cordyceps spp, a traditional Chinese medicine widely used for healthcare in China, and has been recently acted as a strong anticancer agent for clinic. However, whether and how it may play a role in combating tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains unknown. Here we report that cordycepin can kill Mycobacterium by hijacking the bacterial adenosine kinase (AdoK), a purine salvage enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of adenosine (Ado) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP). We show that cordycepin is a poor AdoK substrate but it competitively inhibits the catalytic activity of AdoK for adenosine phosphorylation. Cordycepin does not affect the activity of the human adenosine kinase (hAdoK), whereas hAdoK phosphorylates cordycepin to produce a new monophosphate derivative. Co-use of cordycepin and deoxycoformycin, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADD), more efficiently kills M. bovis and M. tuberculosis. The add-deleted mycobacterium is more sensitive to cordycepin. This study characterized cordycepin as a new mycobactericidal compound and also uncovered a potential anti-mycobacterial mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2951814813,"Prediction of heavy metal bioavailability in intact soil is important to manage soil pollution risks. We developed a regression model for representative Japanese soils to judge their potential vulnerability to cadmium (Cd) pollution. We added four rates of Cd to 17 sample soils to mimic artificial contamination. After aging the contaminated soils, we measured Cd's bioavailability using the diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique. We then evaluated the relationships between bioavailability of Cd ([CdDGT]) and intact soil properties by statistical analyses. Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and pH emerged as significant factors to explain the cadmium bioavailability in Japanese soils. Specifically, lower CEC and lower pH were associated with higher [CdDGT], which poses a higher risk for soil ecosystems. The correlation between pH and [CdDGT] had a high dependence on [CdAdd], whereas that for CEC did not. Regression analysis also showed that the interaction between intact soil pH and spiked concentration ([CdAdd]) had a significant contribution to [CdDGT]. The regression model developed was rationally supported by a biotic ligand model. This simplified but realistic model would be useful in estimating the vulnerability of representative Japanese soils and determining the risk for Japanese soils in relation to Cd contamination."

Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have improved the diagnosis and management of malaria in remote areas, community and places where microscopy is not available for diagnosis. According to WHO report 2018, Plasmodium falciparum malaria constitutes more than 50% of malaria cases in India. Most of the RDTs used for diagnosis of falciparum malaria today employ HRP2 as a target antigen. However, low density parasitemia and deletion of hrp-2 gene in P. falciparum leads to false negative results and necessitates the development of alternative/ new or improved RDT for malaria diagnosis. We have analysed the genetic diversity and homology modelling of Pfgdh (glutamate dehydrogenase), ldh (lactate dehydrogenase) and aldolase genes in P. falciparum isolates from the eight endemic states of India to assess their potential as antigen for RDT development. We observed negligible sequence diversity in Pfgdh in comparison to the low level of diversity in ldh and aldolase gene. No structural or functional changes were observed in modelling studies and all three genes were under negative purifying selection pressure. The highly conserved nature of pfgdh gene suggests that GDH could be a potential target molecule for Pan/Pf diagnostic test for malaria."
https://openalex.org/W2952768874,"Although the relationship between the incorporation of an element into otoliths and the concentration of the element in water has been extensively investigated in many fish species, the interactive effects of multiple elements in water on the otolith incorporation of an element are not adequately explored or well understood. In this study, 16 treatments in triplicate using strontium (Sr; 1, 2, 3 and 4 times the ambient baseline, 6.5 mg l-1) and barium (Ba; 1, 2, 4 and 6 times the ambient baseline, 40 μg l-1) as categorical variables in an orthogonal design were established to evaluate the relative or interactive effects of water elements on otolith elemental incorporation in juvenile flounder Paralichthys olivaceus (from 15 to 116 days post hatching). The results revealed that otolith incorporation (Me:CaOtolith) of Sr and Ba were positively dependent on the concentrations of the elements in water (Me:CaWater). Overall, Sr was incorporated into otoliths more efficiently than was Ba, and the partition efficiency (DMe) of both elements decreased with increasing water elemental concentrations. Increasing Sr concentrations in water appeared to negatively affect the uptake of Ba into otoliths rather than facilitate it, as previously reported in fish reared in freshwater and brackish water, or showed no effect on fish in seawater. Conversely, the Ba concentration in water did not influence the otolith uptake of Sr, which agrees with the findings for other fish species. When applying otolith microchemistry to fish ecology studies, it is essential to cautiously address the interactive effects of multiple elements in the environment on otolith elemental incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W2952392529,"Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the precursor of one of the most potent vasoconstrictors, peptide angiotensin II. Genome-wide association studies have shown that two A/G polymorphisms (rs2493134 and rs2004776), located at +507 and +1164 in intron I of the human AGT (hAGT) gene, are associated with hypertension. Polymorphisms of the AGT gene result in two main haplotypes. Hap-I contains the variants −217A, −6A, +507G, and +1164A and is pro-hypertensive, whereas Hap-II contains the variants −217G, −6G, +507A, and +1164G and does not affect blood pressure. The nucleotide sequence of intron I of the hAGT gene containing the +1164A variant has a stronger homology with the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3)–binding site than +1164G. Here we found that an oligonucleotide containing +1164A binds HNF3β more strongly than +1164G and that Hap-I–containing reporter gene constructs have increased basal and HNF3- and glucocorticoid-induced promoter activity in transiently transfected liver and kidney cells. Using a knock-in approach at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus, we generated a transgenic mouse model containing the human renin (hREN) gene and either Hap-I or Hap-II. We show that transgenic animals containing Hap-I have increased blood pressure compared with those containing Hap-II. Moreover, the transcription factors glucocorticoid receptor, CCAAT enhancer–binding protein β, and HNF3β bound more strongly to chromatin obtained from the liver of transgenic animals containing Hap-I than to liver chromatin from Hap-II–containing animals. These findings suggest that, unlike Hap-II variants, Hap-I variants of the hAGT gene have increased transcription rates, resulting in elevated blood pressure."

Other brain MRI markers of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with the occurrence of postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), but for CMB this is unknown. We aimed to study the association between CMB and the occurrence of POD and POCD in older individuals.The current study consists of 65 patients (72±5 years) from the BIOCOG study, which is a prospective, observational study of patients who underwent an elective surgery of at least 60 minutes. Patients in the current study received a preoperative cerebral MRI scan including a 3D susceptibility-weighted imaging sequence to detect CMB. The occurrence of POD was screened for twice a day until postoperative day 7 by using the DSM-5, NuDesc, CAM, and CAM-ICU.

Statistical analyses consisted of logistic regression adjusted for age and gender.A total of 39 CMB were detected in 17 patients (26%) prior to surgery. POD occurred in 14 out of 65 patients (22%). POCD at 7 days after surgery occurred in 11 out of 54 patients (20%) and in 3 out of 40 patients at the 3 month follow-up (8%). Preoperative CMB were not associated with the occurrence of POD (OR (95%-CI): 0.28 (0.05, 1.57); p = 0.147) or POCD at 7 days after surgery (0.76 (0.16, 3.54); p = 0.727) or at 3 months follow-up (0.61 (0.03, 11.64); p = 0.740).We did not find an association between preoperative CMB and the occurrence of POD or POCD.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02265263) on 23 September 2014."
https://openalex.org/W2949758357,"Only a small portion of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles entering the host cell results in productive infection, emphasizing the importance of identifying the functional virus population. Because integration of viral DNA (vDNA) is required for productive infection, efficient vDNA detection is crucial. Here, we use click chemistry to label viruses with integrase coupled to eGFP (HIVIN-eGFP) and visualize vDNA. Because click labeling with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine is hampered by intense background staining of the host nucleus, we opted for developing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)-specific 2′-deoxynucleoside analogs that contain a clickable triple bond. We synthesized seven propargylated 2′-deoxynucleosides and tested them for lack of cytotoxicity and viral replication inhibition, RT-specific primer extension and incorporation kinetics in vitro, and the capacity to stain HIV-1 DNA. The triphosphate of analog A5 was specifically incorporated by HIV-1 RT, but no vDNA staining was detected during infection. Analog A3 was incorporated in vitro by HIV-1 RT and human DNA polymerase γ and did enable specific HIV-1 DNA labeling. Additionally, A3 supported mitochondria-specific DNA labeling, in line with the in vitro findings. After obtaining proof-of-principle of RT-specific DNA labeling reported here, further chemical refinement is necessary to develop even more efficient HIV-1 DNA labels without background staining of the nucleus or mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2951472215,"Potassium replenishment protocols are often employed across broad patient populations to prevent cardiac arrhythmias. Tailoring potassium thresholds to specific patient populations would reduce unnecessary tasks and cost. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine the threshold at which hypokalemia increases the risk for medically treated arrhythmias in cardiac versus medical and surgical intensive care units.Patients captured in the publicly available Philips eICU database were assessed for initiation of either intravenous amiodarone, adenosine, ibutilide, isoproterenol, or lidocaine as a surrogate for a clinically significant arrhythmia. A landmark time-to-event analysis was conducted to investigate the association of serum potassium values and time-marked administration of an antiarrhythmic drug. Analysis was adjusted for comorbidities, the use of vasopressor agents, diuretics, as well as age, gender and severity of illness.Among 20,665 admissions to cardiac intensive care units, 1,371 (6.6%) were treated with either amiodarone, adenosine, ibutilide, isoproterenol, or lidocaine. For potassium values of ≥3.0<3.5mEq/L, antiarrhythmic treatment occurred at an increased rate compared to a baseline of ≥4.0≤5.0mEq/L (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01-1.51; P = 0.04). For admissions to medical and surgical intensive care units, 2,100 of 69,714 patients (3.0%) were treated with either amiodarone, adenosine, ibutilide, isoproterenol, or lidocaine. Potassium values of ≥3.0<3.5mEq/L were also associated with an increased hazard of treatment (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.09-1.45; P = 0.002). In both cohorts, worsening hypokalemia was associated with an increased risk of antiarrhythmic drug treatment. In neither cohort were there statistically significant differences for serum potassium values of ≥3.5<4.0 and a baseline of ≥4.0≤5.0mEq/L. The proportion of patients initiated on vasopressors or inotropes was over four-fold higher in those treated with one of the antiarrhythmic drugs in both cohorts.Serum potassium levels <3.5mEq/L were associated with an increased hazard for treatment with specific antiarrhythmic drugs in a large cohort of patients admitted to both a cardiac as well as medical and surgical intensive care units. Potassium thresholds may be individualized further based on risk of relevant outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2952961185,"The dosage of pharmaceuticals is determined through the process of clinical development and approval review based on clinical trial results; however, the information obtained from clinical trials before approval is limited. Some pharmaceutical products are used at doses lower than those approved for post-marketing use. The aim of this study was to reveal the actual state of lower-dose prescriptions for post-marketing clinical use of pharmaceuticals. We investigated the factors related to the deviation based on therapeutic area, detailed statement of the approved dosage, clinical data package, and post-marketing requirement. Among the new molecular entities approved in Japan between January 2005 and December 2014, we identified products that are orally administered and have the same daily dose for different indications, if any. For these products, we collected information on the actual daily dose from the medical information databases of Medical Data Vision Co., LTD. and JammNet Co., LTD. Products whose dose was lower than the approved dose (maintenance dose excluding the initial dose) in ≥ 30% prescriptions in 2015 were defined here as ""lower-dose prescription drugs."" We identified 27 lower-dose prescription drugs out of 113 products investigated. The results of the multivariate analysis revealed that factors related to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification and the detailed statement of the approved dosage significantly influenced the occurrence of lower-dose prescription, whereas the factors related to clinical data package and post-marketing requirements did not. These results suggest the limitation in determining an optimal dosage for the actual clinical use of a drug based on the information obtained from clinical trials conducted before approval, emphasizing the importance of reexamining the optimal dosage that is applicable to a greater number of patients after marketing, if necessary. We believe that the utilization of real-world data could be of help in this regard."
https://openalex.org/W2949791014,"Activating mutations in protein kinases are a frequent cause of cancer, and selecting drugs that act on these oncogenic kinases can lead to effective therapies. Targeted or whole-genome sequencing of tumor samples can readily reveal the presence of mutations, but discerning previously uncharacterized activating mutations that will respond to drug treatment from much more abundant but inconsequential passenger mutations is problematic. Chakroborty et al. apply a screening approach that leverages error-prone PCR and a proliferating cell model to identify such gain-of-function mutants in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase. The screen is validated by the identification of known cancer-promoting mutations and reveals a previously unappreciated oncogenic EGFR mutation, A702V, demonstrating its power for discovery of driver mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2951251776,"The primary objective of this review is to investigate what is currently known about early childhood education planning, population health models and their relation to children's development. A systematic review using the Critical Interpretive Synthesis method was undertaken, guided by a preliminary research question, ""How can a population heath approach be applied to educational planning to support children's early development?"" which acted as a compass and guide throughout the process. The initial search yielded 20,122 results, of which 42 were included in the review. Four synthetic constructs emerged (1) Elements of population health models exist within communities and can help improve outcomes for more children, (2) Inter-disciplinary collaboration and partnerships possess unique opportunities to influence children's development, (3) Children's development can be influenced at a variety of levels, and (4) System change requires a range of drivers and supports. Within education, there are several models which are used to improve outcomes for children and families. Although a population health approach to planning does not explicitly exist, the results from this review indicate that it would indeed be plausible to adapt the population health approach to sites and schools, and that doing so would be advantageous for children's development. However, implementing such an approach requires more than desire for change and demands system changes and supports. A protocol for the review was published on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), registration number CRD42018098835 on 31st July 2018."
https://openalex.org/W2951578857,"Using single-cell techniques, the behaviors of individual stem cells are coming under ever-greater scrutiny. Such efforts are pushing the boundaries of technology development in cell biology and are getting to the heart of what defines cellular states, what drives cell-state changes, and what can we learn about biological systems from cell-to-cell variability. A prime example of this trend comes from recent work by Takahashi et al., 2019Takahashi S. Miura H. Shibata T. Nagao K. Okumura K. Ogata M. Obuse C. Takebayashi S.I. Hiratani I. Genome-wide stability of the DNA replication program in single mammalian cells.Nat Genet. 2019; 51: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, who have addressed whether replication timing across the genome is stereotyped between individual cells of the same cell type, and their results raise questions about the potential role of replication timing in the decision-making of differentiating stem cells. Previous studies with bulk sequencing of cell populations have revealed the basic principle that regions that replicate early tend to be euchromatic, actively transcribed, and in the nuclear interior, whereas late-replicating regions tend to be heterochromatic and at the nuclear periphery. Takahashi et al. have now designed and tested an approach to profile early- versus late-replicating regions at the single-cell level in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), before and after differentiation and in an immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cell line. Similar to another recent study by Dileep and Gilbert, 2018Dileep V. Gilbert D.M. Single-cell replication profiling to measure stochastic variation in mammalian replication timing.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 427Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, the authors find that overall genome-wide replication timing is highly consistent between individual cells in a given state and that some regions exhibit more intrinsic variability than others. Going deeper, they reveal an interesting corollary: developmentally regulated genes exhibit higher-than-average variability in replication timing. Does this suggest a link between replication timing variability and developmental plasticity? The variability at these genes does in fact go away upon mESC differentiation. Future work may explore this facet of nuclear organization in stem cell “decision-making” or how this might be exploited to direct different differentiation endpoints. Getting to the molecular basis of the observations of studies such as Takahashi et al. will likely be aided by new approaches to study the behavior of proteins and protein complexes in single cells. In this vein, a recent study in our journal (Hainer et al., 2019Hainer S.J. Bošković A. McCannell K.N. Rando O.J. Fazzio T.G. Profiling of Pluripotency Factors in Single Cells and Early Embryos.Cell. 2019; 177: 1319-1329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) adapts a nuclease-based method for mapping the binding of transcription factors, known as CUT&RUN (Skene and Henikoff, 2017Skene P.J. Henikoff S. An efficient targeted nuclease strategy for high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites.Elife. 2017; 6: e21856Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), for use with very small cell numbers, even single cells. With this modified protocol, called ultra-low input CUT&RUN (uliCUT&RUN), Hainer and colleagues probe the distribution of transcription factors in mESCs and in vivo in pre-implantation embryos. In mESCs, they substantiate the long-standing conjecture that the fractional occupancy of transcription factors such as the pluripotency enabling NANOG and SOX2 in single cells is what underpins variable ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) peaks in bulk analyses. In early embryos, they further establish that NANOG binding in the inner cell mass requires the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, a feature not observed in similar analyses from cultured cells. This technological development will enable more accurate temporal reconstructions of transcription factor activity in individual cells and provides a new means of probing heterogeneity in vivo when tissue samples are limiting. One of the most powerful quantitative and high-throughput means of assessing levels of individual proteins in single stem cells comes from mass cytometry (cyTOF), in which antibodies to proteins of interest are conjugated to heavy metals to enable coupling of flow cytometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A key advantage of cyTOF is the ability to monitor many proteins at once. Palii et al., 2019Palii C.G. Cheng Q. Gillespie M.A. Shannon P. Mazurczyk M. Napolitani G. Price N.D. Ranish J.A. Morrissey E. Higgs D.R. et al.Single-Cell Proteomics Reveal that Quantitative Changes in Co-expressed Lineage-SpecificTranscription Factors Determine Cell Fate.Cell Stem Cell. 2019; 24: 812-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar use this to impressive effect to assay the levels of 27 proteins across 13 time points (using temporal barcoding) during the differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). They specifically examine the trajectories of megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors and find that both KLF1, which biases red blood cell fate, and FLI1, which biases megakaryocyte fate, are expressed in the same bipotential progenitors. They further show that the change in these lineage-specific transcription factors is gradual and not switch-like, as might be expected by a more rigid conceptualization of cell-fate decision-making. One anticipates that these gradual shifts in gene expression in developmental transitions (as observed by Palii et al.), the replication timing variability reported by Takahashi et al., and the conditional binding of transcription factors in early embryos (as seen by Hainer and colleagues) will all be reflected in changes in nuclear organization affecting the relevant loci. To confirm this and attain a more complete biophysical understanding of these transitions and their dynamics, will it one day be possible to track the compartmentalization and transcription factor occupancy of multiple developmentally important genetic loci in a single cell over time?"
