https://openalex.org/W1512986985,"This laboratory has recently reported that, in a reconstituted enzyme system containing alcohol-induced isozyme 3a of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, the sum of acetaldehyde generated by the monooxygenation of ethanol and of hydrogen peroxide produced by the NADPH oxidase activity is inadequate to account for the O2 and NADPH consumed. Studies on the stoichiometry have revealed the occurrence of an additional reaction involving an overall 4-electron transfer to molecular oxygen which is presumed to yield water: O2 + 2 NADPH + 2H+—-2 H2O + 2 NADP+. The occurrence of a peroxidase reaction in which free H2O2 is reduced to water by NADPH was ruled out. When the 4-electron oxidase activity is taken into account, measurements of NADPH oxidation and O2 consumption are in accord with the amounts of products formed in the presence of various P-450 isozymes, either in the absence or presence of typical substrates, including those which undergo hydroxylation, N- or O-demethylation, or oxidation of hydroxymethyl to aldehyde groups. Of the substrates examined, some had no effect on the oxidase reaction yielding hydrogen peroxide or the 4-electron oxidase reaction, some were inhibitory, and some were stimulatory, but the same substrate did not necessarily have the same effect on the two reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2012515679,"We have constructed a series of deletion mutants in the lysozyme promoter region fused to the SV40 T-antigen coding region. Regulated expression was tested after microinjection of the lysozyme deletion mutants into primary cultures of chicken oviduct cells using fluorescent antibodies against T antigen. Deletion of lysozyme gene sequences upstream of position - 164 was accompanied by loss of both progesterone- and glucocorticoid-induced expression. Using the rat liver glucocorticoid receptor for binding studies, two separate binding sites have been identified: a strong binding site that is destroyed by deletion of lysozyme sequences between positions -74 and -39 and a weaker binding site contained between positions -208 and -161 upstream of the lysozyme cap site."
https://openalex.org/W2090889370,"The 40 kd positive transcription factor that interacts with the 50 nucleotide internal control region of 5S ribosomal RNA genes in Xenopus can be subdivided into three functional domains by proteolytic cleavage. At one end of the protein is a 10 kd domain that is required for efficient RNA transcription but not for binding to the DNA. This adjoins a second domain that binds to the 5′ end of the internal control region, a region of the DNA known to contribute only weakly to binding the protein but one that is essential for RNA transcription. The removal of both of these protein domains leaves a half of the protein that binds only to the 3′ side of the control region and is inactive in promoting transcription. Quantitative DNA binding and in vitro transcription experiments show that only a single molecule of 40 kd factor binds to the internal control region, and that this stoichiometry is sufficient to give maximal stimulation of 5S RNA transcription in a reconstituted system. Consideration of the essential DNA contact points of the factor, taken together with the constraints imposed by a 1:1 protein to DNA stoichiometry permit the linear projection of the extended protein molecule onto its binding site along the internal control region of the 5S RNA gene."
https://openalex.org/W2088259533,"Four RNA products have been characterized from a soluble system that accurately splices purified substrate RNA. The labeled substrate RNA contained the first and second exons of the major late transcription unit of adenovirus 2 and a shortened form of the first intervening sequence. One of these RNA products was the excised intervening sequence which accumulated quantitatively with the level of splicing. This RNA species has an unusual structure and is modified at internal sites. A potential intermediate in the splicing pathway which is cleaved at the 5' splice site of the first exon has been isolated. This RNA species is also modified at sites within the first intervening sequence. These results suggest that the splicing of mRNA precursors may involve sites in the intervening sequence, cleavage at the 5' splice site, cleavage at the 3' splice site, and ligation of the two exons."
https://openalex.org/W1634508290,"The occurrence and distribution of the repeating disaccharide [Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc beta 1,3] in the different types of Asn-linked oligosaccharides in mouse lymphoma BW5147 cells have been studied. Glycopeptides were prepared from cells grown in medium containing [6-3H]galactose, and the bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary Asn-linked oligosaccharides were fractionated by serial lectin affinity chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, pea lectin -Sepharose, leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-agarose, and Datura stramonium agglutinin-agarose. As described in this report, the latter lectin binds glycopeptides that contain either the repeating N-acetyllactosamine sequence or an outer mannose residue substituted at C-2 and C-6 by N-acetyllactosamine. The isolated glycopeptides were subjected to methylation analysis, specific exoglycosidase treatments, and digestion with Escherichia freundii endo-beta-galactosidase. Our data indicate that approximately two-thirds of the tetraantennary and one-half of the triantennary Asn-linked oligosaccharides contain repeating N-acetyllactosamine sequences in at least one branch. Many of the repeating sequences contain an additional galactose residue linked alpha 1,3 to a penultimate galactose residue. By contrast, less than 10% of the biantennary oligosaccharides contain the repeating disaccharide. The distribution of the repeating N-acetyllactosamine unit was also examined in a cell line ( PHAR 2.1) that is deficient in UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-mannoside beta 1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. These cells are unable to synthesize tetraantennary and certain triantennary species and instead accumulate biantennary oligosaccharides. The total content of repeating N-acetyllactosamine units is greatly decreased in this line, and those that are present are found predominantly in triantennary Asn-linked oligosaccharides. These results demonstrate that the repeating N-acetyllactosamine sequence occurs commonly in complex-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides in BW5147 cells but is confined primarily to tri- and teraantennary species."
https://openalex.org/W2077418781,"The spacer region of the Xenopus laevis ribosomal gene contains blocks of repetitive sequence elements that are 60 or 81 bp long. These 60/81 bp elements function as enhancer elements for the RNA polymerase I promoter at the 5' end of the gene. An RNA polymerase I promoter adjacent to a block of 60/81 bp elements is always dominant over a promoter on a second plasmid when both are coinjected into oocyte nuclei. If two promoters are placed on the same plasmid containing enhancers, both promoters come under their influence and are codominant. The influence of the enhancers can be transmitted through several kilobases of plasmid sequence, through a potentially active promoter, and is independent of the orientation of the enhancers. The enhancers appear to compete with promoters for the same transcription factor(s); however, the enhancers can only compete when they are on a circular plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W1965072420,"Transmission ratios of male mice heterozygous for various combinations of partial t-haplotypes provide evidence in support of a model for the genetic basis of ratio distortion, involving two or more distorter genes acting on a responder locus. The t form of the responder locus, Tcr, in the medial part of the haplotype, must be present and heterozygous for distortion to occur. When the responder alone is present, as in t low haplotypes, the chromosome carrying it is transmitted in a low ratio (less than 50%). The t forms of the distorter loci act additively, in cis or trans, to raise the transmission of whichever chromosome carries Tcr. Identified distorter loci are Tcd-1, in the proximal part of the haplotype, Tcd-2, distal to Tcr, and probably Tcd-3, lying between Tcr and Tcd-2. In the absence of Tcr the distorters are transmitted normally. The system is compared with the SD system of Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1533103223,"Abstract Intragastric infusion of [1-14C]glucose into awake, fasted rats at rates that produced physiological increases in the circulating glucose concentration resulted in active glycogen deposition in liver. However, degradation of this glycogen revealed extensive randomization of the label among the carbon atoms of glucose. By contrast, muscle glycogen-glucose was labeled primarily in C-1. Treatment of rats with 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, a potent inhibitor of phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase, prior to [1-14C]glucose infusion reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis by 85%; this glycogen contained most of its label in C-1 of glucose. The additional infusion of unlabeled glycerol, which enters the gluconeogenic pathway distal to the 3-mercaptopicolinic acid block, reinstated hepatic glycogen synthesis, but again the label was associated almost exclusively with C-1. In all animals treated with 3-mercaptopicolinic acid, plasma lactate concentrations rose markedly, as did the rate of hepatic lipogenesis. When [1-14C]glucose was infused into pentobarbital-treated rats or administered to awake animals as a large intragastric bolus, the degree of isotopic randomization in liver glycogen-glucose was considerably reduced when compared with that seen in the awake, infused state. The data support the concept that under normal refeeding conditions the bulk of liver glycogen is formed by an indirect pathway involving the sequence glucose ----lactate----glucose-6-P----glycogen, whereas muscle glycogen is formed by the conventional, direct pathway: glucose----glucose-6-P----glycogen. They also establish that a predominantly direct mechanism can be induced in liver, but only under artificial conditions, e.g. chemical blockade of the gluconeogenic sequence, pentobarbital anesthesia, or the administration of massive glucose loads that lead to severe hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2103204666,"The association of mRNA and ribosomes with the cytoskeleton of eucaryotic cells may be important for protein synthesis and its regulation. HeLa cells were gently lysed with detergent, and soluble and cytoskeletal framework subfractions were prepared by centrifugation. We analyzed these fractions for ribosomes and confirmed earlier findings that polysomes are preferentially associated with the cytoskeletal fraction. The levels of initiation factors eIF-2, eIF-3, eIF-4A, and eIF-4B were quantitated by immunoblotting; all are enriched in the cytoskeletal fraction relative to the soluble fraction. Heat shock, fluoride, pactamycin , and cytochalasin caused the release of both ribosomes and initiation factors into the soluble fraction. However, treatment of the cytoskeletal fraction with EDTA or low levels of ribonuclease resulted in polysome degradation but no release. Therefore initiation factor association with the cytoskeletal framework correlates with the presence of ribosomes, whereas ribosome association does not require intact mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2081260355,"Efficient initiation of adenovirus DNA replication requires the presence of specific terminal nucleotide sequences that collectively constitute the viral origin of replication. Using plasmids with deletions or base substitutions in a cloned segment of DNA derived from the terminus of the adenovirus 2 genome, we have demonstrated that the origin contains two functionally distinct regions. The first 18 bp of the viral genome are sufficient to support a limited degree of initiation. However, the presence of a sequence in the region between nucleotides 19 and 67 greatly enhances the efficiency of the initiation reaction. This region contains a specific binding site for a protein present in uninfected cells (KD = 2 X 10(-11) M). The bound protein protects the DNA segment between base pairs 19 and 43 from attack by DNAase I. Studies with deletion mutants indicate that binding of the cellular protein is responsible for the enhancement of initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2082788529,"The adenovirus VAI RNA is a small polymerase III-transcribed species that is required for optimal translation of mRNAs late after infection. Mutant dl331 fails to produce this RNA species and, as a result, grows poorly. Mutant-infected cells contain normal levels of late mRNAs, but reduced levels of polypeptides are synthesized late after infection. Translational elongation occurs at normal rates in mutant, as compared to wild-type, virus-infected cells. Initiation of translation occurs with reduced efficiency in dl331 -infected cells. VAI RNA is required for formation of a stable 48S preinitiation complex and very likely functions to facilitate the interaction between 43S preinitiation complex and mRNA to form the 48S species."
https://openalex.org/W1511580398,"Stimulation of the oxygen (O2) metabolism of isolated human neutrophilic leukocytes resulted in oxidation of hemoglobin of autologous erythrocytes without erythrocyte lysis. Hb oxidation could be accounted for by reduction of O2 to superoxide (O-2) by the neutrophils, dismutation of O-2 to yield hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), myeloperoxidase-catalyzed oxidation of chloride (Cl-) by H2O2 to yield hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the reaction of HOCl with endogenous ammonia (NH+4) to yield monochloramine ( NH2Cl ), and the oxidative attack of NH2Cl on erythrocytes. NH2Cl was detected when HOCl reacted with the NH+4 and other substances released into the medium by neutrophils. The amount of NH+4 released was sufficient to form the amount of NH2Cl required for the observed Hb oxidation. Oxidation was increased by adding myeloperoxidase or NH+4 to increase NH2Cl formation. Due to the volatility of NH2Cl , Hb was oxidized when neutrophils and erythrocytes were incubated separately in a closed container. Oxidation was decreased by adding catalase to eliminate H2O2, dithiothreitol to reduce HOCl and NH2Cl , or taurine to react with HOCl or NH2Cl to yield taurine monochloramine . NH2Cl was up to 50 times more effective than H2O2, HOCl, or taurine monochloramine as an oxidant for erythrocyte Hb, whereas HOCl was up to 10 times more effective than NH2Cl as a lytic agent. NH2Cl contributes to oxidation of erythrocyte components by stimulated neutrophils and may contribute to other forms of neutrophil oxidative cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1511845394,"Nuclear mono- and poly(ADP-ribosyl) protein conjugates formed in living hepatoma AH 7974 cells in response to treatment with the alkylating agent dimethyl sulfate have been studied. They were isolated from the perchloric acid precipitate of freshly prepared nuclei in a relatively pure form and with an overall yield of more than 80%, utilizing aminophenylboronic acid-agarose chromatography. Exposure of the cells to 400 microM dimethyl sulfate led to a transient rise of ADP-ribosylated proteins. After 20 min, the level of endogenous poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues increased by a factor of 21, amounting to a final value of 772 +/- 57 pmol/mg of DNA while the mono(ADP-ribosyl) residues were raised to even higher concentrations (1864 pmol/mg of DNA), corresponding to a 12-fold stimulation as compared to untreated cells. As a result of dimethyl sulfate treatment, the amount of acceptor protein being modified by (ADP-ribose)n was elevated 15-fold, reaching a final proportion of 2.3 +/- 0.4% of total nuclear protein. The increase in (ADP-ribosyl)n-modified proteins was suppressed by benzamide, a potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. More than half of the nuclear mono- and poly(ADP-ribosyl) residues were linked to histone H2B. The modifying residues could be removed from the major acceptor by treatment with 0.1 M NaOH, but not with neutral hydroxylamine. Minor amounts of other histones, especially of histone H4, were possibly also ADP-ribosylated under the stimulating effect of dimethyl sulfate. In addition, several nonhistone proteins with apparent molecular masses of 100-116 and 170 kDa were found to carry substantial amounts of mono- and poly(ADP-ribose)."
https://openalex.org/W1665821241,"Three peroxisomal enzymes of beta-oxidation from rat liver were synthesized in a cell-free protein-synthesizing system derived from a lysate of rabbit reticulocytes. The in vitro products of acyl-CoA oxidase (EC 1.3.99.3) and a bifunctional protein containing enoyl-CoA hydratase (EC 4.2.1.17) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.35) activities were apparently the same in size and charge as the subunit of the respective mature enzymes; that of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.16) was about 3,000 Da larger and more basic than its mature subunit. The free polysome fraction of rat liver was 3.1-5.7 times more active than the membrane-bound polysome fraction in the synthesis of the three peroxisomal enzymes; these values were similar to those for cytosolic enzymes and differed from that for serum albumin. In isolated rat hepatocytes, radiolabeled acyl-CoA oxidase and bifunctional protein increased with time with no appreciable change in the subunit size. On the other hand, the labeled putative precursor of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, as well as the mature form of the enzyme, was detected in the hepatocytes. The radioactivity of the putative precursor reached a plateau in 30 min; that of the mature subunit appeared after a lag time of about 5 min and increased with time up to 90 min. In pulse-chase experiments, the putative precursor disappeared with an apparent half-life of several minutes. When the hepatocytes were fractionated into the cytosolic and the particulate fractions, one half of labeled acyl-CoA oxidase and 60% of the bifunctional protein were recovered in the cytosolic fraction after 10 min of labeling, whereas 70-80% of the labeled enzymes were recovered in the particulate fraction after 40-60 min of labeling. These results indicate that the three enzymes of peroxisomal beta-oxidation are synthesized on free polysomes, released into the cytosol, and then transported into peroxisomes. Our findings also indicate that 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase undergoes proteolytic processing during maturation. The temporal sequence of the proteolytic cleavage and intracellular transport of the thiolase remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2052825249,"We estimated the relative amounts of oligomeric species of spectrin in 0 degrees C red-cell-membrane extracts, including those released from spectrin-actin-polypeptide 4.1 complexes after mild urea treatment. Spectrin dimers, tetramers, and medium-size oligomers were the prominent species, accounting for 5%-10%, 45%-55%, and 25%-35% of spectrin, respectively. When examined by low-angle rotary-shadowing electron microscopy, these medium-size spectrin oligomers (e.g., hexamers, octamers, decamers , dodecamers , and quadecamers ) appeared as polyskelions formed by head-to-head association of three to seven dimers. They were stable species capable of binding to, and subsequent release from, inside-out vesicles without degradation to tetramers or dimers. The data suggest that spectrin tetramers and medium-size oligomers coexist in the normal erythrocyte membrane as the primary native spectrin species."
https://openalex.org/W1512968802,"Using [14C]palmitoyl-CoA as donor and deacylated (fatty acid-free) structural proteins of Semliki Forest virus as exogenous acceptors, palmitic acid was incorporated into polypeptide in a cell-free system with microsomes of baby hamster kidney cells, chicken embryo fibroblasts, and rat liver cells. Out of the four viral proteins (E1, E2, E3, and C) only E1 becomes acylated enzymatically. The protein bound fatty acids of the in vitro product are resistant to detergents and to organic extractions but can be released with hydroxylamine thus affording the typical features of acyl-proteins. Fatty acid transfer to E1 requires the presence of microsomes and is abolished when microsomal membranes are omitted or boiled prior to the incubation. Exogenous acceptor protein E1 had to be deacylated prior to the incubation in order to function during acylation in vitro since no fatty acid chains were transferred into untreated viral E1. Acylation of E1 is time- and temperature-dependent and can be stimulated by increasing the concentrations of acceptor protein, microsomal membranes, or of exogenous fatty acid donor. While Mg2+ does not influence the transfer reaction, Mn2+ leads to a dose-dependent inhibition commencing at a concentration of 1 mM. The cell-free acylation activity fails to show high specificity with regard to the chain length or degree of saturation of the acyl chain used as lipid substrate since palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic acid (C18:1), and myristic acid (C14:0) are all transferred onto E1 as long as ATP is present in the incubation mixture. The type of detergent and its concentration were found to be critical for this acylation in vitro. Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100 both up to a 0.2% concentration allowed the reaction while no enzymatic transfer of palmitic acid onto E1 was detected in the presence of octyl-beta-D-glucoside and Tween 20 at the conditions used for the in vitro incubation. However, when acyl transfer onto lipid acceptors was monitored, the incorporation of fatty acids into the neutral- and phospholipids functioned normally in octyl-beta-D-glucoside only, while Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100 inhibited the acylation of all neutral lipids and of most of the phospholipids completely.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1550334406,"The capacity of whole reticulocyte lysates to catalyze the dissociation of exogenously added eIF-2 X [3H]GDP was determined as a measure of their reversing factor (RF) activity in the recycling of eIF-2 for the maintenance or restoration of protein synthesis. We have examined the relationship of RF activity to the protein synthetic activity of the lysate under normal conditions and on inhibition of protein synthesis by heme deficiency, double-stranded RNA, or oxidized glutathione. A direct correlation was found between a lysate's capacity to synthesize protein and its ability to stimulate the dissociation of eIF-2 X GDP. These findings further support the proposed mechanism by which the phosphorylation of only 30-40% of the eIF-2(alpha) in the lysate renders the limiting amount of RF present non-functional, impairing the recycling of eIF-2 and thereby inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1837793279,"Band 3 is an integral membrane protein that exchanges anions across the red cell membrane. Due to the abundance and the high turnover rate of the band 3 transport unit, the band 3 system is the most heavily used ion-transport system in a typical vertebrate organism. Here we show that 35Cl NMR enables direct and specific observation of substrate Cl- binding to band 3 transport sites, which are identified by a variety of criteria: (a) the sites are inhibited by 4,4'- dinitrostilbene -2,2'-disulfonate, which is known to inhibit competitively Cl- binding to band 3 transport sites; (b) the sites have affinities for 4,4'- dinitrostilbene -2,2'-disulfonate and Cl- that are quantitatively similar to the known affinities of band 3 transport sites for these anions; and (c) the sites have relative affinities for Cl-, HCO-3, F-, and I- that are quantitatively similar to the known relative affinities of band 3 transport sites for these anions. The 35Cl NMR assay also reveals a class of low affinity Cl- binding sites (KD much greater than 0.5 M) that are not affected by 4,4'- dinitrostilbene -2,2'-disulfonate. These low affinity sites may be responsible for the inhibition of band 3 catalyzed anion exchange that has been previously observed at high [Cl-]. In the following paper the 35Cl NMR assay is used to resolve the band 3 transport sites on opposite sides of the membrane, thereby enabling direct observation of the transmembrane recruitment of transport sites."
https://openalex.org/W1500397819,"Calsequestrin, a calcium-binding protein isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, was subjected to physiochemical analysis using sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, gel filtration, sedimentation, viscosity, and circular dichroism techniques. The effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate, alkaline pH, guanidine hydrochloride, and calcium ions on the hydrodynamic properties of the protein were studied. Calsequestrin, in the absence of calcium, had a random coil conformation with an alpha-helical content of 11%. Calsequestrin bound 1.7 mg of sodium dodecyl sulfate per mg of protein resulting in an increase in the alpha-helical content to 20%. The protein was completely random coil in guanidine hydrochloride and had a molecular weight of 42,000 as determined by gel filtration in the presence of this denaturant. Sedimentation equilibrium studies showed that calsequestrin was not subjected to aggregation and had a molecular weight of 38,000. Calsequestrin had a low sedimentation coefficient (2.20 S), a high Stokes radius (45 A), and a high intrinsic viscosity (27.1 ml/g) that increased slightly to 32 ml/g in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, all indicative of a highly extended structure. Similar studies, performed at pH 9.5, revealed that the protein was even more asymmetric at alkaline pH. Calsequestrin bound 50 mol of calcium ions per mol of protein with an affinity of 1 mM as determined by gel filtration. Calcium binding was accompanied by a change of the protein from a highly extended structure (Rs = 45 A) to a much more compact structure (Rs = 35 A)."
https://openalex.org/W1581215757,"A secretory granule associated enzymatic activity from the rat anterior pituitary that can convert the synthetic peptide D-Tyr-Val-Gly into D-Tyr-Val-NH2 is described. Due to the presence of inhibitory activity in the cytosol and rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus fractions, the alpha-amidation activity is barely detectable in crude rat anterior pituitary homogenates. The alpha-amidation activity was primarily soluble, displayed a pH optimum of about 7.0, and showed a requirement for molecular oxygen. The activity was stimulated 7-fold by the addition of optimal concentrations of copper. Of the cofactors tested, only reduced ascorbate produced a severalfold stimulation of activity. Studies with varied D-Tyr-Val-Gly or varied monoiodo-D-Tyr-Val-Gly demonstrate Michaelis Menten kinetics with indistinguishable kinetic constants for both peptides. Upon addition of ascorbate, the apparent Km and Vmax for the synthetic substrate, as estimated from Lineweaver-Burk and Eadie-Hofstee plots, increased by 30- and 60-fold, respectively. Several alpha-melanotropin- and gamma-melanotropin-related peptides with COOH-terminal glycine residues were effective competitive inhibitors of the reaction while the corresponding alpha-amidated peptides were very poor inhibitors. The rat anterior pituitary alpha-amidation activity appears to be very similar to the alpha-amidation activity in rat intermediate and neural pituitary, and mouse anterior pituitary tumor cells."

Chem. 257, 10015-10022) neuronal binding protein for the presynaptic neurotoxin beta-bungarotoxin (beta-BuTx) was solubilized from synaptic membrane fractions of chick brain using the nonionic detergent Triton X-100. 125I-beta-BuTx bound to the solubilized protein with a dissociation constant (KD) of 1.9 +/- 0.1 nM. This binding of 125I-beta-BuTx was Ca2+-dependent and pharmacologically specific. From different basic proteins tested, only unlabeled beta-BuTx and its antagonist dendrotoxin inhibited 125I-beta-BuTx binding. Potassium ions were required during solubilization and binding in order to detect 125I-beta-BuTx-binding activity. Sedimentation in sucrose/H2O and sucrose/D2O gradients and gel exclusion chromatography on Sepharose 6B indicated a s20,w of 12.8 +/- 0.6 S and a Stokes radius of 8.6 +/- 0.2 nm for the solubilized beta-BuTx-binding component. From these data, the protein molecular weight of the beta-BuTx binding site was calculated to be 431,000 +/- 45,000."
https://openalex.org/W1483002472,"Immunochemical polymorphism among human low density lipoproteins (LDL) isolated from different individuals was demonstrated through reduced binding of three monoclonal antibodies to some individual LDL using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. These three antibodies are members of a larger group of monoclonal antibodies previously shown to bind specifically to apoprotein B ( Curtiss , L.K., and Edgington , T. S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 15213-15221; Tsao , B.P., Curtiss , L. K., and Edgington , T.S. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 15222-15228). Those antibodies which distinguished human LDL polymorphism bound to the same or adjacent epitopes on LDL, for they were mutually exclusive in competitive binding experiments. Binding was unaffected by treatment with neuraminidase, with a mixture of glycosidases, or with competing glycoproteins; thus, the carbohydrate moiety of apoprotein B did not appear to influence the epitope recognized by these antibodies. When low density lipoproteins isolated from different individuals were studied, three different phenotypes were recognized; these corresponded to strong, weak, and intermediate binding of the three monoclonal antibodies. This division into three phenotypes is demonstrated to result from a genetic polymorphism; indeed, the data fit a model consisting of two co-dominant apoprotein B alleles, and the three phenotypes then correspond to the two human homozygotes and the heterozygote. The classical Ag antigen phenotype was determined for the LDL isolated from 10 individuals who were also studied with the monoclonal antibodies, and no correspondence was found between the different epitopes recognized by the five presumptive Ag allelic pairs, x/y, a1/d, c/g, t/z, or h/i, and the site recognized by the monoclonal antibodies. All of these data are discussed, and it is concluded that the most likely explanation for the difference in recognition of the two allelic forms of apoprotein B is an alteration in amino acid sequence resulting in a slightly different configuration of a single domain containing the epitopes recognized by the three monoclonal antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1479820551,"Brush-border membranes of renal proximal tubules were solubilized with deoxycholate and some proteins were separated and incorporated into proteoliposomes by a reconstitution procedure which was analyzed in detail. The proteoliposomes contained mainly polypeptides with molecular weights of 152,000, 94,000, and 52,000, each of which could be separated further into homologous polypeptides with different isoelectric points. In the proteoliposomes, Na+ cotransport systems for D-glucose, acidic and neutral amino acids, and mono- and dicarboxylic acids were demonstrated by showing that due to an inwardly directed Na+ gradient the substrate concentrations in the proteoliposomes increased significantly over their respective equilibrium values. Using inhibition experiments, selectivity of the different transporters could be demonstrated. Studying the reconstituted L-glutamate transporter in detail, countertransport of L-glutamate and K+ was shown (i) at Na+ equilibrium the intraliposomal L-glutamate concentration increased significantly over the equilibrium value if an outside-directed K+ gradient was applied; (ii) Rb+ influx was significantly stimulated by the outflux of L-glutamate. By applying a K+ diffusion potential across the liposomal membrane by addition of valinomycin it could be shown that during L-glutamate transport in the presence of Na+ and K+ positive charge is transferred together with L-glutamate and Na+. The apparent Km value of L-glutamate uptake driven by concentration differences of 89 mM Na+ (out greater than in) and 89 mM K+ (in greater than out) was 26.3 +/- 1.3 microM. The Vmax value of 70.2 +/- 2.3 pmol X mg of protein-1 X S-1 was half the value measured in intact membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1647527581,"Abstract Two 13-residue glycopeptides were isolated from the digestion of purified porcine spleen cathepsin B by Staphylococcus aureus protease using high performance liquid chromatography. The major peptide, which is about 73% of the total, had the amino acid sequence His-His-Val-Asn(CH2O)-Gly-Ser-Arg-Pro-Pro-Cys-Thr-Gly-Glu. This peptide contains only a single N-acetylglucosamine residue linked to asparagine at the fourth residue by a beta-linkage. The minor peptide had a single amino acid replacement in a sequence otherwise identical to that of the major peptide. A serine was found at residue 10 instead of a half-cystine. The minor peptide also contains different carbohydrates, which were determined using proton NMR to be Man alpha 1----6 Man beta 1----4 GlcNAc beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----6)GlcNAc beta 1----n Asn. These results suggest that the cathepsin B carbohydrates are processed in vivo by enzymic systems specific to each isozyme."

The flavoprotein moiety of the cross-linked complex maintains most of its diaphorase activity and more interestingly has gained the capacity to catalyze the NADPH-cytochrome c reaction without addition of free ferredoxin in the assay mixture. Furthermore, the cross-linked complex binds NADP+ with a Kd = 88 microM at an ionic strength of 0.02 M. These results show that a ternary complex among the reductase and its substrates can be formed, suggesting that the binding sites for ferredoxin and the pyridine nucleotides are distinct. The bound ferredoxin can interact with cytochrome c; the iron-sulfur cluster of the cross-linked complex is shown to be reduced under anaerobic conditions by NADPH and to be required for the catalysis of the NADPH-cytochrome c reductase reaction. The cross-linked complex, added to thylakoids inhibited by the antibody against the reductase, catalyzes the H2O-cytochrome c photoreduction, which suggests that the ferredoxin moiety of the complex can interact with its electron donor in the photosynthetic chain. Restoration of NADP+ photoreduction requires the addition of free ferredoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1588362477,"Lactoperoxidase in the ferryl state (compound II) reacts with sulfide to form a typical sulfheme -containing hemoprotein as do hemoglobin, myoglobin, and catalase. Ferrous sulflactoperoxidase is primarily formed and then oxidized to its ferric form under aerobic conditions. Similar reactions of lactoperoxidase occurs when methylmercaptoimidazole (MMI) is substituted for sulfide. The yield of the adducts from one-turnover reactions of ferryl lactoperoxidase is 100% with sulfide and about 20% with MMI. Sulfur and MMI of the adducts appear to be removed from the enzyme upon reduction by dithionite. Upon the reactions with cysteine and dithiothreitol, the enzyme is converted to spectral species, which are less characteristic but are similar to ferrous and ferric sulflactoperoxidases , respectively. We conclude that there is no essential difference in the mechanism of reactions of lactoperoxidase with sulfide, MMI, cysteine, and dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1593035710,"Limited proteolysis of porcine brain tubulin with trypsin resulted in a gradual loss of its colchicine binding activity as well as its ability of assembly into microtubules. The analysis of the tryptic degradation products showed a preferential proteolysis of alpha-tubulin subunit. This enzymatic proteolysis cleaved tubulin in one major site producing fragments of 36,000 and 16,000 daltons, the smaller polypeptides containing the carboxyl-terminal residue as shown by 14C tyrosination . However, proteolysis after incubation with 1 X 10(-3) M colchicine resulted in formation of the indicated fragments plus a 41,000-dalton fragment and smaller size peptides indicating the drug induces a second cleavage site closer to the carboxyl-terminal alpha-tubulin. Preincubation of tubulin with [3H]colchicine followed by proteolysis and separation of the fragments by Sephadex G-75 chromatography showed radioactive colchicine associated with the 16,000-dalton fragment and to the smaller size peptides resulting from digestion in the presence of the drug. The data indicate a localization of the colchicine-binding site in the 16,000-dalton segment containing the COOH-terminal region of alpha-tubulin subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1552993337,"Chick embryo tibial chondrocyte growth and activities were compared in serum-free and serum-supplemented media. A basal salts medium containing equal volumes of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or with a mixture of bovine insulin, transferrin, fibroblast growth factor, dexamethasone, a prostaglandin E1 supplement, and a liposome supplement. Chondrocytes grew at identical rates in both media. Insulin, liposomes, and fibroblast growth factor were required for optimum growth in the serum-free medium, but removal of transferrin, dexamethasone, or prostaglandin E1 had little effect on the growth rate. In the serum-supplemented medium, the chondrocytes synthesized Type II collagen, Mr = 59,000 collagen, and both the large, cartilage-specific and the small ubiquitous proteochondroitin SO4 species typically produced by cultured chondrocytes. In the serum-free medium there was a shift toward synthesis of Type I collagen and a loss of the capacity to synthesize Mr = 59,000 collagen and the cartilage-specific proteochondroitin SO4. The loss of capacity for cartilage-specific proteochondroitin SO4 synthesis began immediately after replacement of the serum with the mixture of defined growth factors and the rate of loss was retarded but not reversed when serum was added back in place of the growth factors. When the serum and the mixture of growth factors were added together to the basal medium at the time of cell plating, the chondrocytes grew rapidly and retained their normal phenotype observed in serum-supplemented cultures. Thus, the serum appears to contain factors which are required for retention of the chondrocyte phenotype in culture over and above those factors necessary for cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1587984617,"Incubation of human Glu-plasminogen with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene leads to the specific intra-molecular cross-linking of the kringle 1+2+3 region and the light (B) chain region of plasminogen. This cross-link was found to prevent the conformational change which is induced in Glu-plasminogen by lysine analogues or by proteolytic removal of the NH2-terminal peptide. Our results suggest that the cross-link freezes the closed conformation of Glu-plasminogen, and it seems likely that the transition to the loose conformer requires separation of the kringle 1+2+3 region from the light (B) chain portion. The change in the relative position of these regions during the conformational change in plasminogen is also indicated by our observation that the rate of formation of the intramolecular cross-link is significantly decreased when transition to the loose conformer is induced either by saturation of the lysine-binding sites or by conversion to Lys-plasminogen. Cross-linked Glu-plasminogen is slowly activated by urokinase and melanoma tissue plasminogen activator, but in contrast with uncross-linked Glu-plasminogen conversion to Lys-plasminogen or saturation of lysine-binding sites with ligand does not increase the rate of activation because the cross-link prevents transition to the loose conformer which is susceptible to activation. The fibrin affinity of cross-linked Glu-plasminogen is practically identical with that of Glu-plasminogen. As in the case of uncross-linked Glu-plasminogen, removal of the NH2-terminal peptide causes a marked increase in fibrin affinity although the resulting cross-linked Lys-plasminogen is fixed in the closed conformation. This result suggests that the NH2-terminal peptide inhibits binding of plasminogen to fibrin by direct interaction with the fibrin-binding site, and the conformational change that normally accompanies its removal is not a prerequisite of strong binding."
https://openalex.org/W1485869692,"The kinetics of the reaction with oxygen and carbon monoxide of the homodimeric hemoglobin from the bivalve mollusc Scapharca inaequivalvis has been extensively investigated by flash and dye-laser photolysis, temperature jump relaxation, and stopped flow methods. The results indicate that cooperativity in ligand binding, already observed for oxygen at equilibrium, finds its kinetic counterpart in a large decrease of the oxygen dissociation velocity in the second step of the binding reaction. In the case of carbon monoxide, cooperativity is clearly evident in the increase of the combination velocity constant as the reaction proceeds. Therefore, the ligand-binding kinetics of this dimeric hemoglobin shows the characteristic features of the corresponding reactions of tetrameric hemoglobins. Analysis of the data in terms of the allosteric model proposed by Monod et al. (Monod, J., Wyman, J., and Changeux, J. P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118) has shown that the values of the allosteric parameters cannot be fixed uniquely for a dimeric hemoglobin. The rapid changes in absorbance observed at the isosbestic points of unliganded and liganded hemoglobin following laser photolysis provided a value of 7 X 10(4) S-1 at 20 degrees C for the rate of the ligand-free quarternary conformational change, postulated on the basis of cooperative ligand binding. Comparison of the rapid absorbance changes observed during ligand rebinding in this hemoglobin with those observed in tuna hemoglobin indicate that, at full photolysis, binding to the T state is followed by further binding and conversion to the liganded R state; at partial photolysis, population of the liganded T state occurs immediately and is followed by a decay to the liganded R state upon further ligand binding. These new results, in conjunction with previous equilibrium data on the same system, show unequivocally that the presence of two different types of chain is not an absolute prerequisite for cooperativity in hemoglobins, contrary to currently accepted ideas."
https://openalex.org/W1541077609,"Reassembled low density lipoprotein (LDL) complexes have been prepared by the interaction of lipid-free sodium deoxycholate-solubilized apoprotein B (apoB) of native human LDL with preformed, 200 A in diameter, microemulsions of cholesteryl oleate (CO), surface-stabilized by either egg yolk phosphatidylcholine ( EYPC ) or dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Gel chromatography of PC/CO/apoB complexes shows co-elution of the complex at 43% PC, 43% CO, and 14% apoB. Negative stain electron microscopy shows the particles to be circular, homogeneous, and approximately 200 A in diameter. PC/CO/apoB complexes exhibit beta-migration on agarose gels and show one high molecular weight protein band on 3.0% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray scattering show the lipids in the complexes to undergo at least two specific thermal transitions depending on lipid composition, one associated with the core-located cholesterol esters similar to LDL and the protein-free microemulsions and the other from the phospholipid forming the surface monolayer. In addition, particle disruption-protein unfolding/denaturation occur irreversibly at 80-85 degrees C. At 4 degrees C, the secondary structure of apoB on complexes of EYPC /CO/apoB is similar to that of native LDL. For complexes of DMPC/CO/apoB, the secondary structure shows less alpha-helix which correlates with the difference in surface lipid environment. The reassembled complexes of PC/CO/apoB provide a defined system in which the components may be varied systematically in order to study the molecular organization, molecular interactions, and metabolism of LDL."
https://openalex.org/W1510510554,"Tangier disease is a disorder characterized by low levels of apo-A-I and high density lipoproteins. The defect in Tangier disease is an abnormal A-I apolipo protein, designated apo-A- ITangier . In normal subjects, apo-A-I is secreted as proapo -A-I with subsequent extracellular conversion to mature apo-A-I. The major form in normal plasma is mature apo-A-I with small amounts of proapo -A-I. In Tangier disease, proapo -A- ITangier is present in roughly equivalent concentrations compared to mature apo-A- ITangier . It has been proposed that the defect in Tangier disease is in the conversion of pro- to mature apo-A- ITangier . To test this, proapo -A-I was isolated from normal and Tangier subjects, and the conversion to the mature form by plasma from normal and Tangier subjects was analyzed. Incubation of radiolabeled normal proapo -A-I in normal plasma anticoagulated with heparin was associated with progressive conversion to mature apo-A-I over 24 h (initially 85% of the radioactivity was in the proapo -A-I isoform; at 24 h 33% radioactivity remained in the pro-isoform). Proapo -A- ITangier was also converted to the mature isoform during 24 h of incubation in normal plasma. Initially, 84% of radioactivity was in proapo -A- ITangier , and by 24 h the radioactivity in this isoprotein had decreased to 36%. A similar pattern of conversion was also observed when proapo -A- ITangier was incubated in Tangier plasma. The proteolytic conversion of both normal proapo -A-I and proapo -A- ITangier was unaffected by the serine protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM) or aprotinin (200 Kallikrein-inactivating units/ml), but was inhibited by EDTA (0.1%). These results indicate that proapo -A- ITangier can be converted to mature apo-A- ITangier by the converting enzyme in normal plasma. In addition, plasma from a Tangier subject can convert both normal and Tangier proapo -A-I to the mature form. These results establish that proapo -A- ITangier can be rapidly converted to mature apo-A- ITangier , and there is no deficiency of the converting enzyme activity in Tangier disease."
https://openalex.org/W1977815853,"It has been proposed that H-Y antigen secreted by cells of the Sertoli lineage is bound by receptors on these and other cells of the primordial gonad and thereby initiates formation of the testicular cords, and that H-Y is not an integral transmembrane component but a part of a ternary system with beta 2-microglobulin and products of the MHC. It follows that cultured Daudi cells, which lack beta 2-microglobulin and HLA, should secrete H-Y. This is consistent with evidence obtained with monoclonal H-Y antibody and an ELISA. By this method, free H-Y was demonstrable in the supernatant fluids of cultured Sertoli cells and Daudi cells. The assay provides a useful alternative to detection of H-Y in the complement-dependent cytotoxicity test."
https://openalex.org/W1487239838,"Hen oviduct membranes were incubated with UDP-N-acetyl-D-[14C]glucosamine and [3H]GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3[Man alpha 1-6(Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6]Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc-Asn (glycopeptide Gn(I)M5). Two double labeled products were obtained, both containing 5 Man and 4 GlcNAc residues. In order to separate these isomeric components, the mixture was treated with rat liver Golgi-rich membranes as a source of mannosidase II. One of the isomers was degraded by mannosidase action while the other was not, thereby allowing separation of two products (A and B). Product A was shown to be [3H]GlcNAc beta 1-2[( 14C] GlcNAc beta 1-3,4, or 6)Man alpha 1- 3Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc, proving that hen oviduct membranes were capable of incorporating GlcNAc in beta-linkage into the Man alpha 1-3- residue of Gn(I)M5. Product B was identified as [3H]GlcNAc beta 1-2Man alpha 1-3[( 14C]GlcNAc beta 1-4)-[Man alpha 1-3)Man alpha 1-6]Man beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1- f4GlcNAc , showing that hen oviduct membranes could incorporate a bisecting GlcNAc residue (linked beta 1-4 to the beta-linked Man) into Gn(I)M5. The ability of hen oviduct to carry out these two reactions in vitro supports the hypothesis first suggested by Harpaz and Schachter ( Harpaz , N., and Schachter , H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 4894-4902) that the synthesis of bisected hybrid oligosaccharides is controlled by the insertion of a bisecting GlcNAc residue into Gn(I)M5. The presence of a bisecting GlcNAc residue prevents mannosidase II action and the synthetic pathway is therefore committed to hybrid oligosaccharide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1490163593,"Abstract Numerous models describing anion exchange across the red cell membrane by band 3 have been discussed in literature. These models are readily distinguished from one another by an experiment which tests the ability of band 3 transport sites to be recruited to one side of the membrane. In order to observe directly the transmembrane recruitment of transport sites, we have developed 35Cl NMR techniques that resolve the two transport site populations on opposite sides of the membrane. Using these techniques, we show that the inhibitors 4,4'- dinitrostilbene -2,2'-disulfonate and p- nitrobenzensulfonate each recruit all of the transport sites on both sides of the membrane to the extracellular facing conformation. This result indicates that band 3 has an alternating site transport mechanism: each band 3 transport unit possesses a single functional transport site which is alternately exposed first to one side of the membrane then to the other."
https://openalex.org/W1526816668,"Mice immunized to bovine insulin were observed to develop anti-idiotypic antibodies which behaved in in vitro assays as antibodies to the insulin receptor. The studies described here were undertaken to investigate the effects of these antibodies in vivo on the physiology of glucose homeostasis and the state of insulin receptors. Mice developing anti-idiotypic receptor antibodies manifested abnormal fasting blood glucose concentrations: a period of hypoglycemia followed by a period of hyperglycemia. Moreover, the mice were deficient in their ability to respond to a glucose load. Changes in the number and activity of insulin receptors were associated with these physiological aberrations. In an insulin binding assay, adipocytes obtained from immunized mice had only 40% of the number of insulin receptors demonstrable on the adipocytes of control mice. The lipogenic response of the affected adipocytes was also relatively insensitive to insulin, and in addition, they manifested only 70% of the maximal response to high concentrations of insulin. Thus, development of anti-idiotypic receptor antibodies appeared to be associated with insulin resistance of adipocytes and abnormal glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1580537399,"Primary cultures of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]dopamine or [3H]norepinephrine and examined for radioactive and total catecholamine contents by high performance liquid chromatography after additional incubations of 15 min to 10 days. [3H]Dopamine was rapidly taken up by chromaffin vesicles in situ and converted to norepinephrine with a half-time of approximately 6 h. [3H] Norepinephrine taken up by the cells was metabolized in three phases. 1) During its brief transit through the cytoplasm, 20 to 35% of this amine was converted to [3H]epinephrine. 2) Following vesicular accumulation, 65 to 70% of the remaining [3H]norepinephrine was methylated to form [3H]epinephrine with a half-time of approximately 30 h, corresponding to the rate of vesicular catecholamine loss from reserpine-treated cells. 3) The residual [3H]norepinephrine decreased with a half-time of 5 days, probably representing loss from norepinephrine-storing cells. [3H]Epinephrine formed endogenously had a half-life in the cultures of approximately 15 days. These data suggest that leakage of norepinephrine from chromaffin vesicles into the cytoplasm limits the rate of dopamine conversion to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla. The kinetic data indicate that approximately 18% of the endogenous norepinephrine and 73% of the endogenous dopamine are present in epinephrine cells."
https://openalex.org/W1482509117,"A fully translated actin biosynthetic intermediate containing N-acetylcysteine at the NH2 terminus has been identified in homogenates of differentiated mouse BC3H1 cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells labeled with L-[35S]cysteine. Thermolysin digestion of the highly acidic NH2-terminal tryptic peptide of this intermediate and electrophoretic analysis of the resulting fragments indicated that the intermediate was a precursor of smooth muscle alpha- isoactin , the major isoactin species in vascular smooth muscle. Carboxypeptidase A digestion of the thermolysin cleavage product corresponding to the first eight amino acid residues of the NH2-terminal tryptic peptide demonstrated an acetylcysteine-glutamate residue at the NH2 terminus. These results imply that the gene for smooth muscle alpha- isoactin , like genes coding for skeletal and cardiac alpha- isoactins , contains a cysteine codon immediately following the initiator methionine codon. Both the methionine and cysteine residues must be removed from the NH2 terminus of the intermediate to yield the mature form of smooth muscle alpha- isoactin . The removal of the cysteine residue in vivo is not direct but apparently involves acetylation of the cysteine and subsequent post-translational cleavage of the resulting acetylcysteine. Such an acetylation-dependent pathway has been demonstrated for removal of cysteine from the NH2 terminus of Drosophila actin synthesized in a cell-free translation system ( Rubenstein , P. A., and Martin, D. J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11354-11360). In vivo pulse-chase experiments indicate that the smooth muscle alpha- isoactin intermediate in BC3H1 cells turns over much more slowly than nonmuscle actin intermediates previously identified in mouse L-cells."
https://openalex.org/W1530098671,"5'-Deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (methylthioadenosine) is cleaved to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (methylthioribose-1-P). Methylthioribose-1-P is converted to 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyrate ( ketomethylthiobutyrate ) which is transaminated to methionine. We report that one subline of a heterogeneous human colon carcinoma, DLD-1 Clone D, only forms methylthioribose-1-P from methylthioadenosine or 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioinosine (methylthioinosine), a deaminated derivative of methylthioadenosine, whereas Clone A converts methylthioadenosine and methylthioinosine to methionine, as shown by growth studies in culture of Clone A and Clone D cells and radioactive studies utilizing [methyl-14C]methylthioadenosine or [methyl-14C]methylthioinosine in the presence of extracts of these cells lines. To characterize this defect, we utilized three protein fractions isolated from rat liver which together convert methylthioribose-1-P to ketomethylthiobutyrate . Addition of only Fraction A to Clone D sonicates restores its ability to convert methylthioadenosine to methionine. This fraction is responsible for converting methylthioribose-1-P to 5- methylthioribulose -1-phosphate; radioactive studies confirm this observation. Thus, Clone D is deficient in an enzyme contained in Fraction A; this represents a qualitative biochemical difference between the two clones derived from a single human tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1577021468,"The effect of deoxygenation on the amount of hemoglobin (Hb) proximal to the membranes of intact, density-fractionated normal (AA) and sickle (SS) red cells was studied by estimating resonance energy transfer efficiencies from fluorescent probes, 12-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid or 2-(9-anthroyloxy)stearic acid, in the outer lipid layer to cytoplasmic hemes. For each density fraction, heme concentrations at the cytosol-membrane interface (hb) were derived from the probe decay rates for ghosts and intact cells, measured by front-face fluorometry, and compared with mean cell heme concentrations (hc). With AA cells, hb/hc varied little with cell density; a 33% drop in hb on deoxygenation is attributable to organic phosphate binding to deoxy-Hb. With oxy-SS cells, hb/hc increased with cell density to twice the values for AA cells, but SS ghosts showed no evidence of increased probe quenching by membrane-bound Hb. On deoxygenation, hb for each SS density fraction fell (reversibly) to one-third the oxy value. The finding that deoxy-HbS withdraws from the membrane bilipid layer much more than deoxy-HbA is consistent with evidence for an increased net negative charge on deoxy-HbS polymers and/or the suggestion that the cytoskeleton, readily penetrated by monomeric Hb, presents a barrier to polymeric HbS. Membrane-associated HbS is therefore thought to play an unimportant role in polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1577764776,"Vibrio harveyi aldehyde dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of long chain aliphatic aldehydes to acids, has been discovered to have both acyl-CoA reductase and thioesterase activities. Tetradecanoyl-CoA was reduced to tetradecanal in the presence of NAD(P)H, as monitored by the stimulation of luciferase activity by the aldehyde product (acyl-CoA reductase). In the absence of NADPH, [3H]tetradecanoyl-CoA was hydrolyzed to the hexane-soluble fatty acid (thioesterase). Inhibition data with N-ethylmaleimide suggest that a single active site on aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for all three enzymatic activities. The acyl-CoA reductase activity was maximal at low NADPH concentration (about 1 microM), whereas much higher concentrations of NADH (greater than 100-fold) were required for optimal activity. Further increases in NADPH or NADH concentrations inhibited both the acyl-CoA reductase and thioesterase reactions. On the basis of the specificity of aldehyde dehydrogenase for NADP(H), an improved purification procedure employing affinity chromatography on 2', 5'-ADP-Sepharose is described. Although fatty acid reductase activity could not be reconstituted, aldehyde dehydrogenase specifically stimulated the rate of acylation of the acyl protein synthetase component from the Photobacterium phosphoreum fatty acid reductase system. This observation, combined with the partial reversal of aldehyde oxidation described above, suggests a possible role for aldehyde dehydrogenase in aldehyde biosynthesis for the luminescent reaction in V. harveyi."

The aim of the present investigation was to elucidate the primary structure of the oligosaccharide units of this protein. For the study of the O-glycosidic oligosaccharide chains, the protein was subjected to beta-elimination and the resulting oligosaccharide preparations were analyzed by 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The structure of the predominant glycan, a hexasaccharide: (formula; see text) and that of a tetrasaccharide: NeuAc alpha(2----3)Gal beta(1----3)[NeuAc alpha (2----6)]GalNAc-ol, were determined. The protein possesses approximately 40 hexasaccharides and 3 tetrasaccharides/mol. For the isolation of its N-glycosidic oligosaccharide chains, the protein was exhaustively digested with proteases followed by chromatography of the desialyzed resulting glycopeptide fraction on concanavalin A-Sepharose. 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy of the obtained preparations revealed the presence of 3 diantennary N-glycosidic chains that are extended with a Fuc residue at the Asn-linked GlcNAc."

The amount of transfer between donor and acceptor vesicles of defined phospholipid composition was determined. Protein-mediated transfer between vesicles of long chain, fluid phase PCs (di-16:1 PC, di-17:1 PC, di-18:1 PC, di-18:2 PC, or egg PC) was markedly higher than transfer between vesicles of solid phase or short chain, fluid phase PCs (di-18:0 PC, di-16:0 PC, or di-14:0 PC). When di-14:0 PC and di-18:1 PC were present in the same vesicle, protein-mediated transfer of di-18:1 PC was still higher, indicating that the protein's specificity toward long chain, fluid phase PCs is based on true acyl chain structure preference rather than a bulk phase physical property of the longer chain PCs. The effect of adding a third type of vesicle to a system which consisted of transfer protein, donor vesicles, and acceptor vesicles was investigated. Addition of solid phase PC vesicles does not affect transfer of the well transferred species, while addition of the poorly transferred short chain, fluid phase PCs does inhibit transfer. These results suggest that the transfer protein has the ability to bind to any fluid phase PC vesicle, although it preferentially extracts and transfers long chain, fluid phase PCs."
https://openalex.org/W1522582346,"beta-Thrombin, a product of the limited proteolysis of alpha-thrombin, is characterized by greatly reduced fibrinogen-clotting activity as compared to alpha-thrombin but with unchanged activity toward ester substrates. The present study was designed to elucidate the basis for the changes in the catalytic activity resulting from the conversion of bovine alpha-thrombin to bovine beta-thrombin. Fibrinogen was utilized as a competitive inhibitor in the hydrolysis of a peptide nitroanilide substrate by bovine alpha- and beta-thrombin. The Ki values obtained for fibrinogen in these experiments were similar for alpha- and beta-thrombin (about 10 microM). Similar values for Ki were obtained when fibrinogen was used to inhibit the inactivation of bovine alpha- and beta-thrombin by diisopropylphosphorofluoridate. These experiments suggested that the conversion of bovine alpha- to beta-thrombin does not affect the fibrinogen-binding site on thrombin. Differences in the reactivity of functional groups at the active site were then explored. beta-Thrombin was observed to undergo modification at the active site histidine at a slower rate than that of alpha-thrombin when reacted with either tosyllysyl chloromethyl ketone or diethyl pyrocarbonate. It is suggested that the difference in the fibrinogen-clotting activity of these two forms of thrombin can result from changes in the reactivity of the active site histidine residue."
https://openalex.org/W1575986200,"Photodissociation of oxygen from the ferrous subunits of hybrid hemoglobins in which the heme of either the alpha or the beta chain has been replaced by cobalt protoporphyrin IX shows large differences between the subunits. With a 25-ns light pulse, the apparent quantum yield at the end of the flash is greater for the beta-iron hybrid than for the alpha-iron hybrid. With the beta-iron hybrid, the yield is greater when solution conditions favor the T-state. After the flash, a part of the oxygen which has been dissociated recombines with a half-time of the order of tens of nanoseconds. The proportion is greatest in the R-state at low temperature and least in the T-state. With the alpha-iron hybrid, oxygen is much less readily removed, and the rapid recombination is slight or absent. It is seen most clearly at low temperatures in conditions which favor the T-state. The long term (greater than 100 ns) effect is that oxygen is much more readily removed from the beta-iron hybrid in the T-state than under any other condition. Analogous flash experiments performed with human hemoglobin A may be closely simulated by superposition of the results obtained with the two hybrid hemoglobins under the same conditions. Isolated human alpha and beta--SH chains show differences similar to, but less marked than, those of the iron-cobalt hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W1560012214,"GDP regulation of basal and receptor-mediated catecholamine-sensitive human fat cell adenylate cyclase was studied using purified plasma membrane preparations and assay conditions selected to minimize conversion of GDP to GTP. Under ordinary assay conditions (low NaCl concentration) and with App(NH)p as substrate to prevent GDP conversion to GTP, basal enzyme activity was stimulated up to 2-fold by GDP (0.1 mM) while addition of epinephrine (0.1 mM) eliminated stimulation by GDP and reduced basal adenylate cyclase activity. With ATP as substrate, the enzyme was not responsive to hormone in the absence of guanyl nucleotides and GDP augmentation of basal activity was small (0-1.5-fold) while stimulatory effects of epinephrine and isoproterenol were minimally but definitely exhibited (1.5-fold over basal). Guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S), a GDP analog resistant to phosphorylation and hydrolysis and an antagonist of GTP, stimulated enzyme activity more than did GDP but did not promote epinephrine action. Rather, inhibition of GDP beta S-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was seen with both epinephrine and isoproterenol and also with GTP. In the presence of NaCl (200 mM), which alone produced 2-3-fold increase in basal enzyme activity, GDP (0.1 mM) and GDP beta S (50 microM) produced 8- and 15-fold increases of activity, respectively. Addition of UDP, to prevent possible conversion of GDP to GTP, had no effect on NaCl-enhanced activation by GDP. The results indicate that the human fat cell adenylate cyclase system is unique in responding to GDP and its analog GDP beta S by stimulation in the absence of hormone but suggest that as in other systems catecholamine-mediated stimulation is normally dependent on GTP. Salts (Na+) appear to stimulate the enzyme by facilitating the interaction of the guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein (N8) with the catalytic unit."

The initial form of haptoglobin detected in hepatocytes exhibited Mr = 46,000, was glycosylated, and corresponded in migration to the initial species formed when the mRNA for rabbit haptoglobin was translated using the reticulocyte lysate system coupled with dog pancreatic microsomes. This one-chain intermediate was rapidly cleaved into a glycosylated form of the beta chain and into the mature alpha chain, these chains being joined by disulfide linkages. Dimerization also occurred rapidly, forming a tetrameric precursor of haptoglobin. Several other intracellular glycosylated forms of the beta chain were detected subsequently, representing intermediates formed during oligosaccharide processing prior to secretion of mature haptoglobin. Addition of tunicamycin (5 micrograms/ml) inhibited glycosylation of the initial form of haptoglobin detected, but subsequent proteolytic processing into alpha and beta chains still occurred. Our results showed that the pathway of biosynthesis of rabbit haptoglobin closely resembles that reported for rat haptoglobin ( Hanley , J. M., Haugen , T. H., and Heath, E. C. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7858-7869)."

Lactate production from monomethyl succinate by hepatocytes is also inhibited by 3- aminopicolinate . This compound elevates the concentrations of pyruvate, malate, and aspartate but decreases that of phosphoenolpyruvate in hepatocytes incubated with lactate plus pyruvate. In rats, the ability of 3- aminopicolinate to elevate blood glucose concentration is unimpaired by renalectomy . The drug does not significantly affect glycemia in functionally hepatectomized rats but accelerates blood lactate and pyruvate accumulation to higher maximum concentrations even when kidney function is also ablated. It is concluded that 3- aminopicolinate inhibits phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in hepatocytes, that the reported stimulation of renal glutaminase and glutamine gluconeogenesis by this compound does not contribute significantly to its hyperglycemic property, and that the drug increases gluconeogenic substrate supply from peripheral tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1515180627,"Abstract The enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase, is a dimer consisting of two identical subunits which contain overlapping subunit regions ( Eichele , G., Ford, G.C., Glor , M., Jansonius , J.N., Mavrides , C., and Christen , P. (1979) J. Mol. Biol. 133, 161-180), suggesting the possibility of subunit interactions. The structurally similar cytosolic isozyme exhibits noncooperative binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate ( Boettcher , M., and Martinez -Carrion, M. (1975) Biochemistry 14, 4528-4531; Relimpio , A., Iriarte , A., Chlebowski , J.F., and Martinez -Carrion, M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 4478-4488) in which the apoenzyme/holoenzyme hybrid dimer shows a distinctive thermal stability. Using a nonequilibrium isoelectric focusing technique, it can be shown that mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase also binds cofactor in a noncooperative random fashion. However, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms show different characteristics from the cytosolic form. These differences are interpreted in terms of unique subunit interactions in this isozyme. Heating to the various DSC transition temperatures shows that the anomalous DSC thermograms in partially coenzyme-saturated apoenzyme preparations are due to a selective dissociation of apoenzyme subunits into monomers which are irreversibly denatured. The remaining holoenzyme monomers reassociate and form stable holoenzyme dimers. The net result is retention of the initial concentration of holoenzyme subunits present in any given mixture. Random occupancy of active sites and similar electrophoretic and DSC patterns upon heating of partially saturated apoenzyme preparations is observed whether the coenzyme, pyridoxal phosphate or pyridoxamine phosphate alone, or borohydride-reduced Schiff's bases of coenzyme-substrate analogue derivatives are used as active site directed ligands. The latter resemble covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates."
