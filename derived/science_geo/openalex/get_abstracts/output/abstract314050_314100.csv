https://openalex.org/W2087528106,The shells of the pelagic larvae of bivalve mollusks may be useful as paleoclimatic indicators. An inverse relationship between temperature and maximum size of larval shells within a particular population is reported for a number of Recent species. Changes in the dimensions of the prodissoconch-dissoconch boundary on juvenile specimens may reflect changes in the ambient temperature of marine environments.

The lead sentence should read,"" The hazard to animals and man of eating excessive amounts of nitrates and nitrites...."" The first sentence in the fourth paragraph should read,"" These circumstances ... the existent but unquantified hazard of adding nitrites to food."" Nitrites-not nitrates-are deliberately added to foods."
