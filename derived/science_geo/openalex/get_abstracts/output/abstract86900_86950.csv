Some consultation programs, although limited in versatility, have achieved levels of performance rivaling those of human experts. A collateral benefit of this work is the systematization of previously unformalized knowledge in areas such as medical diagnosis and geology."

Serum samples from patients with AIDS and from matched and unmatched control subjects were examined for the presence of antibodies to cell membrane antigens associated with human T-cell leukemia virus. Nineteen of 75 of the AIDS patients had antibodies directed to surface antigens of Hut 102, a reference T lymphoid cell line infected with the leukemia virus, as did two of the 336 control subjects."

https://openalex.org/W2023881865,"A comparison between eukaryotic gene sequences and protein sequences of homologous enzymes from bacterial and mammalian organisms shows that intron-exon junctions frequently coincide with variable surface loops of the protein structures. The altered surface structures can account for functional differences among the members of a family. Sliding of the intron-exon junctions may constitute one mechanism for generating length polymorphisms and divergent sequences found in protein families. Since intron-exon junctions map to protein surfaces, the alterations mediated by sliding of these junctions can be effected without disrupting the stability of the protein core."
https://openalex.org/W1647306826,"Vacuolar membrane vesicles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae accumulate Ca2+ ion in the presence of ATP, not in the presence of ADP or adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. Calcium transport showed saturation kinetics with a Km value of 0.1 mM and optimal pH of 6.4. Ca2+ ion incorporated in the vesicles was exchangeable and released completely by a protonophore uncoupler, 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzilidenemalononitrile (SF6847), or calcium-specific ionophore, A23187. The transport required Mg2+ ion but was inhibited by Cu2+ or Zn2+ ions, inhibitors of H+-ATPase of the vacuolar membrane. The transport activity was sensitive to the H+-ATPase inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, but not to oligomycin or sodium vanadate. SF6847 or nigericin blocked Ca2+ uptake completely, but valinomycin stimulated it 1.35-fold. These results indicate that an electrochemical potential difference of protons is a driving force for this Ca2+ transport. The ATP-dependent formation of the deltapH in the vesicles and its partial dissipation by CaCl2 were demonstrated by fluorescence quenching of quinacrine. This Ca2+ uptake by vacuolar membrane vesicles is suggested to be catalyzed by a Ca2+/H+ antiport system."

https://openalex.org/W1489932031,"Islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, is an oligomeric protein (Tamura, M., Nogimori, K., Murai, S., Yajima, M., Ito, K., Katada, T., Ui, M., and Ishii, S. (1982) Biochemistry 21, 5516-5522), the biggest subunit (Mr = 28,000, referred to as the A-protomer) of which catalyzes transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD to the membrane Mr = 41,000 protein. The pentamer, termed the B-oligomer, consisting of the residual subunits was the moiety of IAP that was responsible for binding to the cell surface, as revealed by competitive inhibition of the development of the IAP actions on intact rat C6 glioma cells and rat adipocytes. The binding of the B-oligomer to its receptor proteins was divalent via the constituent two dimers; it stimulated mitosis of lymphocytes and caused an insulin-like action to enhance glucose oxidation in adipocytes, just as did concanavalin A, presumably as a result of cross-linking or aggregation of the membrane proteins. The A-promoter displayed its biological action on adipocytes only when the B-oligomer had been bound to the cells. Thus, IAP is a typical A-B toxin in which the B-oligomer is first bound to the cell surface proteins to enable the A-protomer to reach to the site of its action within the cell. Diverse biological actions of pertussis toxin may be accounted for by the mitogenic action of the B-oligomer as well as ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the A-promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1679608726,"We have examined the importance of the positively charged NH2 terminus of the major outer membrane lipoprotein precursor, prolipoprotein, in the early steps of secretion in Escherichia coli. For this purpose, we have generated three mutants using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in which the charge at the NH2-terminal region was changed from +2 to +1, 0, and -2. The results indicate that the synthesis of prolipoprotein is facilitated by the presence of a positively charged NH2 terminus. In addition, the translocation of prolipoprotein across the cytoplasmic membrane does not absolutely require any basic amino acids at its NH2 terminus. However, the presence of a net negatively charged NH2 terminus causes an initial cytoplasmic accumulation of prolipoprotein which is slowly, post-translationally translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane at a rate which is dependent on the number of positive charges present in this region. The analysis of these mutants clearly demonstrates the importance of the NH2 terminus of the lipoprotein signal peptide in initiating the secretion of this protein in E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W1574438828,"The delivery of cholesterol to canine serum or plasma altered the distribution of cholesterol and apoproteins in subclasses of high density lipoproteins (HDL). In these experiments, two in vitro systems were employed. The first system used cholesterol-celite particles to deliver cholesterol to canine plasma during 4-h incubations. When the cholesterol distribution in the lipoproteins was analyzed by Geon-Pevikon electrophoresis, an increase in cholesterol content was found in the slower migrating subclasses of HDL (HDL1 and HDLc). A large increase in apoprotein E (apo-E) was also observed in the lipoproteins. Densitometric analysis of lipid-stained, 4 to 30% gradient acrylamide gels of canine plasma after incubation with cholesterol-celite revealed that the concentration of the major high density lipoproteins (HDL3) decreased, and the concentration of subclasses of HDL-with apo-E (HDL1 and HDLc) increased 2- to 5-fold. In the second system, cholesterol-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages released cholesterol to HDL in an incubation medium containing 10 to 20% canine serum. The HDL1 and HDLc, which demonstrated slower electrophoretic mobility as determined by Geon-Pevikon block electrophoresis, became enriched in cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Gradient gel electrophoresis showed substantial increases in these subclasses of HDL-with apo-E. The cholesterol-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages synthesized and secreted apo-E into the medium. When L-[35S]methionine was used as a precursor, 65 to 90% of the 35S-labeled protein associated with the lipoproteins in the 1.02 to 1.09 density range was immunoprecipitated with antibody directed against rat apo-E. Gradient gel electrophoresis of density fractions demonstrated the presence of HDL1 and HDLc as the major lipoproteins. In addition, when canine 125I-HDL3 (primarily apo-A-I-containing HDL) were added to canine serum and incubated with cholesterol-loaded macrophages, the appearance of HDL1 and HDLc was associated with a marked increase in the 125I label in these newly formed, cholesteryl ester-rich lipoproteins. There was a corresponding marked reduction in the 125I-HDL3 in the serum. Similar results were observed using human HDL3 and human serum."

Glutathione is positive in the test even at concentrations found in mammalian tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1966413318,"We describe two subpopulations of actin antibodies isolated by affinity chromatography from a polyclonal antibody to chicken gizzard actin. One subpopulation recognizes γ actins from smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells, but does not recognize α actin from skeletal muscle. The other subpopulation recognizes determinants that are common to a actin from skeletal muscle and the two γ actin isotypes. Neither antibody recognizes cytoplasmic β actin. Both antibodies recognize only actins or molecules with determinants that are also present in actins. By immunofluorescence we found that the anti-γ actin colocalizes with mitochondria in fibers of mouse diaphragm, and that it does not bind detectably to the I bands of sarcomeres. The antibody that recognizes both α and γ actins stains I bands intensely, as expected. We interpret these observations as preliminary evidence for selective association of γ actin with skeletal muscle mitochondria and, more broadly, as evidence for subcellular sorting of isoactins."
https://openalex.org/W2132860695,"The primary structure of the cytotoxin alpha-sarcin was determined. Eighteen of the 19 tryptic peptides were purified; the other peptide has arginine only. The complete sequence of 17 of the peptides was determined; the sequence of the remaining peptide was determined in part. The sequence of the 39 NH2-terminal residues was obtained by automated Edman degradation. The carboxyl-terminal amino acids were identified after carboxypeptidase treatment. The assignment of the amino acids in the tryptic peptides was confirmed and their alignment established from the sequence of the secondary tryptic peptides obtained after cleavage of citraconylated alpha-sarcin, from the sequence of a 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine peptide, from the sequence of a chymotryptic peptide, and from the sequence of a peptide obtained with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. alpha-Sarcin contains 150 amino acid residues; the molecular weight is 16,987. There are disulfide bridges between cysteine residues at positions 6 and 148 and between residues 76 and 132."
https://openalex.org/W2022032133,"It has been proposed that the efficient localization of the outer membrane protein LamB requires a functional signal sequence and at least two additional regions contained within the mature protein. We define these regions more precisely by deletion analysis, and we describe methods for cloning deleterious lacZ fusions onto high-copy-number plasmids and generating in-frame deletions. Analysis of the effects of a series of internal lamB deletions on the export of a LamB-LacZ hybrid protein and of the LamB protein itself indicates that necessary informational signal(s) required for localization lie at the amino-terminal end of the protein. In addition, our analysis indicates that there is a region of information close to or within the fusion joint of the largest lamB-lacZ fusion that increases the efficiency of the export process. A unique deletion that removes a protein segment from amino acid 70 to 200 appears to prevent proteolytic removal of the signal sequence. Nevertheless, the mutant protein is exported to the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1608127365,"Bacteriophage T7-induced DNA polymerase is composed of a 1:1 complex of phage-induced gene 5 protein and Escherichia coli thioredoxin. Preparation of active subunits in the absence of sulfhydryl reagents indicates the reduced form of thioredoxin is sufficient for formation of the active holoenzyme. The oxidized form of thioredoxin, thioredoxin modified at one active site sulfhydryl by iodoacetate or methyl iodide, or thioredoxin modified at both active site sulfhydryls by N-ethylmaleimide, are all inactive, being defective in complex formation with gene 5 protein. Thioredoxin sulfhydryl groups present in native T7 DNA polymerase do not appear to be involved in an intersubunit disulfide bond; one and probably both sulfhydryls are available in the native holoenzyme for modification by N-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, DNA substrates alter the reactivity of thioredoxin cysteines within the holoenzyme with respect to this reagent. Substrates for the single strand exonuclease enhance the reactivity of thioredoxin sulfhydryl groups while those for the polymerase or double strand exonuclease functions afford protection. It, therefore, seems likely that thioredoxin sulfhydryl groups are present in the reduced state within the native polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1627330551,"As reported previously (Parodi, A.J., and Cazzulo, J.J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7641-7645), label was incorporated first to the glucose residues of protein-bound Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man8GlcNAc2, and Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 when Trypanosoma cruzi cells, the causative agent of Chagas disease, were incubated with [U-14C]glucose. It is now reported that the glucose residues are removed from the oligosaccharides after a chase period. The relative proportion of Man9GlcNAc2, Man8GlcNAc2, Man7GlcNAc2, and Man6GlcNAc2 appeared to be the same after 120 and 180 min of chase, thus indicating that these compounds were the fully processed protein-bound oligosaccharides. No complex type protein-bound oligosaccharides were detected. Evidence is presented indicating that Glc1Man7GlcNAc2 was formed mainly by glucosylation of Man7GlcNAc2 and not by demannosylation of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Man9GlcNAc2 was the first oligosaccharide to be labeled when cells were incubated with [2-3H]mannose. Based on these and previous results, the overall mechanism of protein N-glycosylation appeared to be: (formula; see text) The structure of the oligosaccharides appeared to be similar to some of those present in human glycoproteins. T. cruzi cells isolated from distant locations in South America were found to share a common mechanism of protein glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2139499209,"Glyoxalase I (EC 4.4.1.5), which catalyzes the reaction methylglyoxal + GSH leads to S-lactoylglutathione, is a ubiquitous enzyme for which no clear physiological function has been shown. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, methylglyoxal may derive from the spontaneous decay of intracellular glyceraldehyde-3-P, which may accumulate during growth on glycerol as the carbon source. The half-life time for the triose phosphate was found to be 4.6 h under physiological conditions (pH 6.2, 0.05 M phosphate at 30 degrees C). Glyoxalase I is induced by growth on glycerol or by the addition of methylglyoxal to the growth medium. The enzyme is also subject to carbon catabolite repression. A mutant strain, fully defective in glyoxalase I and bearing only one nuclear mutation, was obtained. The strain, which is killed by exposure to glycerol, excretes methylglyoxal into the medium. Growth of the mutant on glucose as carbon source appears to be similar to that of the wild type strain. This investigation has clearly demonstrated a physiological role of glyoxalase I in a eucaryotic cell."
https://openalex.org/W1577259555,"An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for the quantification of C1 inactivator-kallikrein (C1In-K) complexes. The formation of complexes assayed by this method parallelled the inhibition of plasma kallikrein esterase activity by C1 inactivator in purified systems. C1In-K complexes were detected when a final concentration of 5.7 nM plasma kallikrein was added to plasma, equivalent to the activation of 1% of the plasma prekallikrein. Exogenous Hageman factor fragment added to plasma induced the rapid formation of C1In-K complexes, whereas there was an appreciable delay when the plasma contact system was activated by the addition of kaolin. In both systems, the rate of formation and final amount of complex generated were directly related to the concentration of Hageman factor fragment or of kaolin added, indicating that this proteolytic pathway is tightly regulated. C1In-K complexes were not generated by kaolin in plasma congenitally deficient in Hageman factor or prekallikrein or by kallikrein in hereditary angioedema plasma deficient in C1 inactivator, thus confirming the specificity of the assay. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation studies showed plasma C1In-K complexes to have a molecular weight consistent with a 1:1 molar complex. In contrast, the complex displayed an anomalously high molecular weight on gel filtration chromatography. These data demonstrate that a sensitive and specific probe has been developed for documenting plasma kallikrein activation."
https://openalex.org/W1547363949,"We recently described the use of reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography for the separation of the proteins of the 30 S subunit of Escherichia coli ribosomes (Kerlavage, A. R., Kahan, L., and Cooperman, B. S. (1982) Anal. Biochem. 123, 342-348). In the present studies we report improvements in the technique and its extension to the separation of the proteins of the 50 S subunit and of 70 S ribosomes. Using an octadecasilyl silica column and a trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile solvent system, the 21 proteins of the 30 S subunit have been resolved into 17 peaks, the 33 proteins of the 50 S subunit into 22 peaks, and the 53 proteins of the 70 S ribosome into 31 peaks. The proteins present in each peak have been identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, by comparison with previously standardized chromatograms, and by calibration with authentic samples of purified proteins. All of the known ribosomal proteins have been identified on the chromatograms with the exception of L31 and its variant, L31'. Three protein peaks, not corresponding to known ribosomal proteins, have been observed in preparations from the total protein from 50 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes, but the significance of these peaks is unclear. The reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography technique has the potential for purifying all ribosomal proteins, as demonstrated by the increase in resolution we obtain when a peak isolated under standard gradient conditions and containing several proteins is reapplied to the column and eluted with a shallower gradient. Its utility in preparing proteins for functional studies is demonstrated by a reconstitution of active 30 S particles using 30 S proteins prepared by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1497234650,"A new method of peptide analysis is presented which allows assignment of unknown proteins to coding regions of genomes which have been sequenced. This approach involves comparison of the molecular weights of peptides generated by partial proteolytic digestion with those predicted for a protein whose primary amino acid sequence is deduced from a corresponding nucleotide sequence. The proteolytic digestions are accomplished in situ in the stacking gel of a two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel system. We have used this system to show that two variant proteins of the human mitochondrial DNA, MV-1 and MV-2, are allelic and encoded by the unidentified reading frame 3 (URF 3) gene. This assignment was supported by sequence analysis of a clone of this mtDNA region from a HeLa cell line which expresses the uncommon variant MV-2. Four nucleotide changes were found in HeLa URF 3, relative to the reported sequence from human placenta. Two of these changes alter the primary amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. It is proposed that one of those amino acid changes may account for the observed molecular weight variation in MV-1 and MV-2 by proteolytic cleavage, conformational change, or secondary modification. We have used this method to also assign a mitochondrially translated protein to URF 6. These are the first assignments of mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides to human URF genes and prove conclusively that at least some of these genes are expressed in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1555034684,"Link protein (Mr = 42,000) is an integral component of cartilage as well as of some noncartilagenous tissues. In cartilage, it forms a macromolecular complex with cartilage proteoglycan and hyaluronic acid, but its function in other tissues is unknown. We provide evidence here that the link protein of cartilage binds well to native collagen types I and III. The binding occurs only if both link protein and collagen are native. The binding of link protein to collagen type fibrils is higher than to monomeric collagen. Link protein binding to collagen fibrils is saturable and occurs at molar ratio of collagen to link protein of 7-13:1. These data suggest that the link protein binds to collagen and that the binding requires the collagen to be in its native triple helical structure. This interaction may play a role in collagen fibril formation."
https://openalex.org/W1577918814,"Membrane-bound nitrate reductase purified from Escherichia coli was resolved into two separate forms. The majority of the enzyme complex had a subunit composition of 2A:2B:4C, exhibited cytochrome b spectra, and was found to be stable after purification. A second form of nitrate reductase activity was a modified complex with a subunit composition of 2A:2B and lacked cytochrome. The subunit B from this complex was altered in its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The cytochrome-containing enzyme had 28 +/- 2 atoms of iron and 1.35 atoms of molybdenum whereas iron and molybdenum in cytochromeless enzyme were 24 +/- 2 atoms and 1.18 atoms/molecule, respectively. Besides cytochrome-containing nitrate reductase, two other cytochrome b-containing fractions were also resolved. These were cytochrome b associated with formate dehydrogenase and a novel cytochrome b with reduced absorption maxima at 430, 529.5, and 560 nm. Nitrate reductase cytochrome b (subunit C) was isolated from subunits A and B as a partially denatured form and its renaturation was accomplished by dialyzing against hemin. The renatured cytochrome yielded absorption spectra similar to the holoenzyme. The pure cytochrome aggregated upon heating, even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. It had a high isoelectric point (pH greater than 9.5) and had 45% hydrophobic amino acids."

https://openalex.org/W1571120500,"Using the technique of radiation inactivation we have previously shown that the insulin receptor behaves as if it is composed of at least two functional components: a binding component (Mr approximately equal to 100,000) and an regulatory component (Mr approximately equal to 300,000). The interaction between the and binding component results in a decrease in the of the receptor for insulin. To examine in more detail the interaction between this affinity regulator and the binding component we have studied the insulin receptor by radiation inactivation under conditions which alter receptor concentration or receptor affinity. Liver membranes of ob/ob mice exhibit a decrease in insulin binding when compared to their lean litter mates which is due to a decrease in receptor concentration. When studied by radiation inactivation, however, there was no detectable change in the interaction or size of the two receptor components. By contrast, under circumstances in which the of the receptor was increased (treatment with high salt, high pH, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1-5 micrograms/ml of trypsin), the interaction between the regulatory and binding components was either decreased or absent, i.e. there was no increase in binding with irradiation. Conversely, conditions which produce a decrease in receptor resulted in an increase in the interaction between the regulatory and binding components. The changes in receptor and interactions of the two components produced by either high salt or pH were reversible. Partial purification of the solubilized receptor on lectin columns resulted in the apparent removal of the regulator, i.e. receptor was increased. In this state, radiation inactivation studies revealed a monoexponential decay indicating no interaction between binding and regulatory components. Taken together, these results suggest that the is a membrane protein which is both trypsin-sensitive and has disulfide bond(s) essential for its function. The interaction between the and binding component is not via a covalent bond and the two components appear to be separated by lectin chromatography. The interaction between these components appears to be altered in most states associated with altered receptor affinity."

https://openalex.org/W1527507579,"The differentiation of mouse 3T3-L1 cells is characterized by an accumulation of cytosolic triglyceride and marked increase in many enzymatic activities involved in triglyceride biosynthesis. The specific activity of one such enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, increases at least 20-fold and is due to a parallel increase in the intracellular concentration of the protein. Pulse-labeling experiments demonstrated that the increase in the specific activity of pyruvate carboxylase was due to an increase in the rate of enzyme synthesis. In the differentiated cell, pyruvate carboxylase represented 1.9% of the total cellular protein and 1% of the protein radiolabeled during a 1-h pulse. This was 35-and 28-fold higher than in the undifferentiated cell, respectively. The turnover of pyruvate carboxylase in the differentiated cell was similar to that in the undifferentiated cell with the enzyme having a half-life of 28-35 h. The half-life of apopyruvate carboxylase in avidin-treated 3T3-L1 cells was 24 h, indicating that the turnover of the apoenzyme was not significantly different than that of the holoenzyme. Radiolabeling pyruvate carboxylase with [14C]biotin and [3H]leucine demonstrated that the turnover of biotin associated with the enzyme was identical to the turnover of the enzymatic protein."

https://openalex.org/W1552716245,"A comparison of the processes controlling the increase in hepatic malic enzyme activity in insulin-treated normal and diabetic rats indicated the existence of two distinct regulatory mechanisms. Livers were removed at 12, 36, and 60 h after insulin treatment of normal and alloxan-diabetic rats, and the activity, quantity, and specific activity (units/nmol), of malic enzyme was determined. In normal rats, a significant increase in activity occurred 12 h after insulin, whereas 36 h of insulin treatment was required for diabetic rats to show an increase in enzyme activity. This suggested that the return of malic enzyme activity from the depleted levels measured in diabetic rats probably involved a different sequence of events. A malic enzyme specific radioimmunoassay confirmed this. The increase in activity in insulin-treated normal rats was due to an increase in the quantity of malic enzyme. In insulin-treated diabetic rats, the increase in activity resulted from increases in both enzyme quantity and the specific activity of the enzyme, which returned to levels observed in normal rats."
https://openalex.org/W1963554944,"Interleukin 2, a lymphokine that acts as a second signal of cellular immune response by way of its action as a T-cell growth factor, was morphologically identified by immunoperoxidase staining. With the use of a monoclonal antibody to interleukin 2 and several complex-forming antisera, the lymphokine was readily distinguished in cytocentrifuge preparations of peripheral blood leukocytes stimulated with a T-cell mitogen. When preparations of cloned interleukin 2 producer and responder cells were stained by the same procedures, discrete patterns of both responder and producer cell phenotypes were revealed. Interleukin 2 producer T cells exhibited a characteristic intense, ringlike cytoplasmic staining, whereas the responder cells (as exemplified by interleukin 2-dependent cell lines) exhibited a less intensive, spotlike membrane staining. In addition, intense membrane localization of interleukin 2, reminiscent of potential capping phenomena, could be observed in stained preparations of cloned responder cells."
https://openalex.org/W1529219652,"The cellular localization of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was studied in the mouse lung after induction by lipopolysaccharide treatment. No significant indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was detected in alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells, which were recovered by alveolar lavages and trypsin-treatment, respectively. To determine this enzyme activity in other types of lung cells, we prepared monodispersed lung cells (6.5 X 10(7) cells/lung) by incubation with 0.1% collagenase and 0.1% trypsin. In a Percoll isopycnic gradient, the dispersed cells were distributed with two peaks at the densities of 1.040 and 1.080 g/ml. The enzyme activity was recovered exclusively in the lighter fractions. As examined by electron microscopy or more quantitatively by using various marker enzyme activities, endothelial cells (angiotensin-converting enzyme as a marker enzyme of these cells), alveolar interstitial cells (prostaglandin dehydrogenase), type I epithelial cells, type II epithelial cells, alveolar macrophages (beta-glucuronidase), Clara cells (coumarin hydroxylase), and polymorphonuclear leucocytes (arylsulfatase) were distributed with peaks at the densities of 1.033, 1.040, 1.042, 1.045, 1.070, 1.082, and 1.093 g/ml, respectively. The distribution pattern of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity exactly coincided with that of alveolar interstitial cells. The localization of this enzyme in alveolar interstitial cells was immunohistochemically confirmed with the anti-indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase antibody."

https://openalex.org/W1562743462,"As a part of the study of the bacteriophage T4-induced deoxyribonucleotide synthetase complex, an investigation has been made of the T4 ribonucleoside diphosphate reductases formed by a series of mutants of nrdA and B, the genes coding, respectively, for the alpha 2 and beta 2 subunits of the enzyme. dATP affinity columns were used to isolate the enzyme by a single-step procedure. The molecular weights of the alpha and beta chains have been found to be 84,000 and 43,500, respectively, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Since alpha 2 beta 2 is bound to dATP affinity columns through allosteric effector sites on alpha 2, it is possible to monitor the binding of beta 2 to alpha 2. dTTP- and ATP-Sepharose columns did not bind T4 alpha 2 beta 2, although the corresponding nucleoside triphosphates are effectors of the enzyme and although the alpha 2 subunit of the host enzyme binds to these columns. Missense mutants of nrdA and B forming alpha 2 and beta 2 subunits that lacked catalytic activity but retained the ability to form the alpha 2 beta 2 complex have been described. The 50,000-dalton fragment formed by an amber mutant of nrdA did not bind to the dATP affinity column, providing evidence that a region of the carboxyl-terminal segment of the alpha chain is required for retention. The beta 2 subunit appears to protect the alpha 2 protein. On infection by nrdB mutants not forming beta 2, the alpha protein chain was cleaved specifically to form 3 protein chains of 61,000, 57,000, and 24,500 daltons, which retain the ability to bind to dATP-Sepharose. Some effects of mutation on the interaction of the alpha and beta chains of the enzyme with the deoxyribonucleotide synthetase complex have been examined."

One form, a hexagonal bipyramid, develops when Mg2+ and PPi are added to the protein solution. The space group is P62(22) or P64(22) with a = b = 128.8 A, c = 140.0 A, and one subunit in the asymmetric unit. The other, a regular octrahedron, forms with the addition of 5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. It is of space group P41(2)1(2) or P4(3)2(1)2, with a = b = 121.8 A, c = 172.6 A, and two subunits in the asymmetric unit."
https://openalex.org/W1540179500,"In the absence of another exogenous nutrient, L-leucine but not L-norleucine stimulates insulin release from rat pancreatic islets, although the corresponding keto acids, 2-ketoisocaproate and 2-ketocaproate, are equally potent secretagogues. Such a situation cannot be ascribed to the preferential transamination of L-leucine as compared to L-norleucine in islet homogenates. Indeed, in the presence of a suitable activator of glutamate dehydrogenase, L-leucine and L-norleucine stimulate secretion to the same extent. It is concluded that the rate of transamination of these amino acids in intact islet cells depends on the availability of a 2-keto acid partner rather than on the assayed amino acid aminotransferase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1517924997,"An enzymatic activity which modifies nitrate reductase has been identified in the cytoplasmic membrane of Escherichia coli. This activity changes subunit B to a form with a slightly greater electrophoretic mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels (B'). The B' polypeptide produced by this modifying enzyme was compared to an apparently identical polypeptide identified in the precursor form of nitrate reductase which can be found in the cytoplasm of all strains and in the membrane of mutants defective in the insertion of nitrate reductase. These B' polypeptides were all identical with respect to mobility on gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and peptides produced by limited digests using trypsin, papain, and Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. When compared to subunit B, the proteolytic gel maps of B' polypeptides showed minor differences. From the identity of the modified B' with precursor B', the ability to convert B into B' in vitro and the in vivo nature of B' as a precursor of B, it was concluded that the modification of B to B' is a reversible process and is due to the removal of one or more small nonprotein molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1601219098,"An RNA processing enzyme has been isolated from Caulobacter crescentus which is specific for double-stranded RNA, has an absolute requirement for monovalent cations, and can be eluted from a poly I:C agarose affinity column in pure form. This enzyme, like RNase III isolated from Escherichia coli, processes precursor ribosomal RNAs and polycistronic phage mRNAs and has a monomeric Mr of approximately 20,000. The two enzymes differ, however, in the recognition of specific cleavage sites and yield different digestion products when either coliphage T7 or C. crescentus phage phi Cdl early mRNA is used as substrate. Two lines of evidence are presented which show that an RNase III activity functions as a processing enzyme in C. crescentus. (a) In an in vitro reaction, C. crescentus phage phi Cdl major early mRNA synthesized in vitro by host RNA polymerase was processed by RNase III to yield RNA species which co-migrated with phage RNA synthesized in vivo in phi Cdl-infected cells, and (b) an in vitro transcript of a C. crescentus DNA clone containing the entire 16 S gene and part of the 23 S gene was processed by C. crescentus RNase III to yield an RNA product which co-migrated with 16 S RNA. The RNase III activity isolated from C. crescentus cell extracts has potential use in the analysis of specific RNA species because it was found to be more stringent in the recognition of cleavage sites than the E. coli enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1524516403,"Heavy metal derivatives of the galactose binding protein of Salmonella typhimurium were obtained by the treatment of crystals with carbon disulfide under anaerobic conditions, followed by exposure to mercury-containing reagents. Carbon disulfide reacts with protein amino groups to give a metastable dithiocarbamate, which is susceptible to covalent derivatization by mercurials. The number of amino groups which react for any particular crystalline protein will depend on the pH, the composition of the crystal mother liquor, and the steric accessibility limitations imposed by crystal packing. Direct reaction with protein crystals, rather than solution derivatization followed by purification and subsequent crystallization, is used to promote isomorphism of the derivative crystal with the native and to limit the number of available sites. For the S. typhimurium galactose binding protein, carbon disulfide treatment, followed by reaction with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, resulted in binding at two sites at pH 8.0. Similar treatment with dimercury acetate gave one binding site for the dimercurial at the same pH. Both derivatives were isomorphous with the native crystal to a resolution of at least 3.5 A. These heavy atom derivatives have been used to produce an interpretable electron density map of the protein at 3-A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1565146744,"The initial rate of entry of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose into isolated frog sartorius muscles was measured at various concentrations of substrate, at 0, 9, 19, or 29 degrees C, after prior incubation at 19 degrees C with a maximally stimulating concentration of insulin. Control muscles were treated similarly, except for the omission of insulin. A saturable transport system provided for most of the entry of 3-O-methylglucose into muscle cells, but a small amount of penetration occurred by a nonsaturable route. The major effect of insulin was to produce a large increase in activity of the suturable system. The Vmax of entry increased, but there was no significant change in the apparent Km. The ratio of insulin-stimulated to basal Vmax was 10 when transport was measured at 29 degrees C but was 22 at 0 degrees C. These findings support the hypothesis that, although a large part of the effect of insulin on sugar transport can be accounted for by an increase in the number of functional transporters in the plasma membrane, there is a separate hormonal effect that permits a relatively greater activity of transporters at lower temperatures, compared with control rates. An additional effect of insulin was to produce a small but definite increase in the entry of sugar by the nonsaturable transport system."
https://openalex.org/W2621782699,"Britain's Medical Research Council is set to begin clinical trials of folic acid for preventing neural tube defects (NTDs), pending final approval of the research protocol by the Scottish Home Health Departments. Scottish authorities are closely scrutinizing the wording of information to be given to potential volunteers, who would be pregnant women who have already given birth to a child with an NTD and who might bring legal action in the event that folic acid proves effective, if they are assigned to a control group and then bear another child with an NTD."
