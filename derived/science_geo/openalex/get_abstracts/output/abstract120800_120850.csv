Recently, however, there is accumulating evidence that it is also involved in cell growth in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We have shown that the hypertrophic agent angiotensin II stimulates superoxide production by activating the membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase and that inhibition of this oxidase attenuates vascular hypertrophy. However, the molecular identity of this oxidase in VSMCs is unknown. We have recently cloned the cytochrome b558α-subunit, p22phox (one of the key electron transfer elements of the NADPH oxidase in phagocytes), from a rat VSMC cDNA library, but its role in VSMC oxidase activity remains unclarified. Here we report that the complete inhibition of p22phox mRNA expression by stable transfection of antisense p22phox cDNA into VSMCs results in a decrease in cytochrome b content, which is accompanied by a significant inhibition of angiotensin II-stimulated NADH/NADPH-dependent superoxide production, subsequent hydrogen peroxide production, and [3H]leucine incorporation. We provide the first evidence that p22phox is a critical component of superoxide-generating vascular NADH/NADPH oxidase and suggest a central role for this oxidase system in vascular hypertrophy.

A Raf-dependent intact cell assay system for monitoring the activation of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) permitted us to evaluate the role of PKC isotypes in MAP kinase activation. Treatment of cells with TPA or epidermal growth factor resulted in the activation of MEK and ERK. The activation of the MAP kinase pathway triggered by epidermal growth factor was completely inhibited by dominant-negative Ras (RasN17), whereas the activation triggered by TPA was not, consistent with previous observations. The introduction of an activated point mutant of PKCδ, but not PKCα or PKCϵ, resulted in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. The activation of MEK and ERK by an activated form of PKCδ requires the presence of c-Raf and is independent of RasN17. These results demonstrate that activation of PKCδ is sufficient for the activation of MEK and ERK and that the pathway operates in a manner dependent on c-Raf and independent of Ras.

The activation of MAP kinases requires the dual-phosphorylation of Thr and Tyr residues by activating kinases, MAP kinase kinases (MEK1 and MEK2). The activity of MAP kinase kinases is also regulated by phosphorylation, and the responsible kinases have been identified (3Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem.

The extracellular stimuli that activate MAP kinases include insulin, EGF, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, serum, phorbol esters, nicotine, okadaic acid, and activators of oocyte maturation. The signaling pathway involved in the activation of ERKs has been intensively studied for c-Raf and Ras, and the mechanism of their activation has been analyzed in detail. This has led to an understanding of the presence of a linear array of signaling pathway initiated by tyrosine kinases to activate Ras, c-Raf, MEKs, and ERKs (7Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2200) Google Scholar). However, there remain many fundamental questions concerning the mode of activation of c-Raf and the signaling pathway from extracellular stimuli to the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. mitogen-activated protein extracellular signal-regulated kinase MAPK/ERK kinase epidermal growth factor protein kinase C 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate myelin basic protein Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium glutathione S-transferase TPA response element chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. One of these questions concerns the role of protein kinase C (PKC), a family of enzymes activated through a pathway involving a diverse set of lipid metabolites activated by phospholipase C, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, and other molecules (8Nishizuka Y.

Although these observations suggest a link between PKC and MAP kinase activation, there has been no direct demonstration that some members of the PKC family actually activate the pathway. Furthermore, the target of PKC in the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, if PKC is involved, remains to be clarified. The involvement of Ras (14Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S.

Furthermore, a protein tyrosine kinase, PYK2, has also been reported to be involved in Ras-dependent MAP kinase activation (33Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The involvement of PKC in this novel pathway has also been suggested. However, the above studies used TPA, raising the fundamental question of whether PKC is actually involved. The presence of a set of cellular proteins that bind to phorbol esters and the observation that their activities are modulated by phorbol esters also raises the question of whether the effect of TPA on MAP kinases actually involves PKC. Cellular phorbol ester receptors other than PKC include Ras-activating guanine nucleotide exchange factor and Rac-GTPase activating protein (34Gulbins E. Coggeshall K.M. Baier G. Telford D.

In the present study, we addressed the question of whether PKC is actually involved in MAP kinase activation by TPA, and, if it is, which PKC isotype is involved. Using a series of PKC kinase-knockout mutants and mutants with constitutive kinase activity, we show that PKCδ is actually involved in the signaling pathway from TPA to Raf-MEK-ERK activation that operates in a Ras-independent manner. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Corp. TPA was from Sigma, phosphatidylserine was from Funakoshi, and 2-mercaptoethanol was from Nacalai Tesque. Oligopeptide MBP4-14, corresponding to the amino acid residues 4-14 of MBP, was synthesized and purified as described previously (36Mizuno K. Kubo K. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Osada S. Kuroki T. Ohno S.

The constitutive active PKC mutants contain single or double point mutations in the inhibitory pseudosubstrate sequences within the regulatory domain. PKCα (αR22A/A25E) contains substitutions of alanine for arginine at position 22 and glutamic acid for alanine at position 25. PKCδ (DR144/145A) contains substitutions of alanine for arginine at positions 144 and 145, as described (44Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S.

Expression plasmids for MEK1, c-Raf, Ki-Ras-Asn17, PKCα, PKCδ, PKCϵ, and PKC point mutants were constructed from an expression plasmid, SRD (42Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The epitope-tagged ERK1 and MEK1 expression plasmids were constructed from an expression vector SRD, a DNA fragment encoding a His-tag/T7-epitope derived from pBlueBac (Invitrogen), and ERK1 or MEK1 cDNA, as described (48Akimoto K. Takahashi R. Moriya S. Nishioka N. Takayanagi J. Kimura K. Fukui Y. Osada S. Mizuno K. Hirai S. Kazlauskas A. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). COS1 cells and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum or 7% calf serum, respectively. For monitoring MEK and PKC activity by immunoprecipitation, COS1 cells were cotransfected with tag-MEK1 cDNA expression plasmid together with the cDNA expression plasmids of c-Raf, PKC, or RasN17, as indicated using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad) (49Osada S. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfected cells were seeded in 10% fetal calf serum-DMEM at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. After 24 or 48 h of culture, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.2 ml/dish of cell lysis buffer (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 sucrose, 10 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100). The cells were disrupted by brief sonication, and the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation. When indicated, cells were starved for 18-20 h in serum-free DMEM and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml TPA or 10 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. The total amount of transfected cDNA was adjusted to the corresponding empty vector in all experiments. For the immunoprecipitation of tag-MEK1, the supernatant from COS1 cells was preincubated with protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) for 30 min at 4°C. After removing materials bound to protein G-Sepharose, the tag-MEK1 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-T7-tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen), which was pre-adsorbed to the protein G-Sepharose by incubation for 1.5 h at 4°C. The Sepharose resin was washed four times with buffer A (10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 m 2-mercaptoethanol) and then once with buffer B (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m EDTA, 0.5 m EGTA, 10% glycerol, 2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 m 2-mercaptoethanol), and the immunoprecipitates were mixed with 100 μl of 18 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation. The immunoprecipitated tag-MEK1 fixed on 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose was suspended in 40 μl of assay mix containing 18 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 m Mg(OAc)2, 50 μ ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.), and 0.36 μg of bacterially produced GST-ERK1 for 10 min at 30°C, and then 20 μg of MBP (Sigma M1891) for 20 min at 30°C. One-half of the reaction mixture (20 μl) was transferred onto a 2 cm × 2-cm piece of p81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman). The filters were washed four times with 75 m phosphoric acid. Phosphorylation was quantitated by scintillation counting. The remaining materials were eluted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Rat ERK1 cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI site of the bacterial expression vector pGEX-3X to yield pGEX-3X:ERK1. The construct was transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue, and recombinant GST-ERK1 protein was expressed and purified as reported (50Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For ERK mobility shift assay, the cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods (44Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2231-2340Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). After 6 h exposure to the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate, the medium was changed to 7% calf serum-DMEM for NIH3T3 cells or 10% fetal calf serum-DMEM for COS1 cells. After an additional 18 h of culture, the cells were washed and lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. When indicated, cells were starved for 18-20 h in serum-free DMEM for COS1 cells or 0.5% fetal calf serum-DMEM for NIH3T3 cells after exposure to the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate for 6 h; then cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TPA, 10 ng/ml EGF, or 50 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor for 5 min or 10 min. The cell lysate was briefly sonicated and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis, followed by Western blot analysis. The intensity of the band corresponding to the tag-ERK1 was quantified by a densitometer. The mobility shift of tag-ERK1 was expressed as the percentage of the shifted band in relation to the total amount of tagged ERK1. For immunoprecipitation of PKC, the supernatant from COS1 cells was preincubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4°C. After centrifugation to remove materials bound to protein A-Sepharose, each PKC protein was immunoprecipitated with its respective anti-PKC antibody pre-adsorbed to the protein A-Sepharose by incubation for 1.5 h at 4°C. The Sepharose resin was washed in the same way as for the immunoprecipitation of tag-MEK1, and the immunoprecipitates were mixed with 100 μl of 20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation. Antibody against PKCα was obtained from guinea pigs immunized with bacterially synthesized protein with an amino acid sequence corresponding to the sequence 18-672 of rabbit PKCα (42Ohno S. Akita Y. Konno Y. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Cell. 1988; 53: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).

The immunoprecipitated PKC was fixed on 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose and suspended in 40 μl of assay mix containing 20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 m Mg(OAc)2, 0.2 m CaCl2, 50 μ ATP, 2 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml MBP4-14 as a substrate (36Mizuno K.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with or without 25 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipid, Inc.) and 50 ng/ml TPA (Sigma) for 20 min at 30°C. PKC activity was measured in the same way as MEK activity. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was soaked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. ERK and MEK were detected using polyclonal antibodies raised against ERK1 (06-182) and MEK1 (06-235) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. PKC isotypes were detected using monoclonal antibodies raised against PKCα (P16520), PKCδ (P36520), and PKCϵ (P14820) (Transduction Laboratories). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit or mouse Ig (Amersham) was used as a secondary antibody for signal detection by the ECL detection system (Amersham). To address the question of whether PKC is actually involved in the activation of MAP kinase and, if it is, how PKC activates MAP kinase, we devised an assay system in COS cells where the effect of exogenous proteins in the activation of MEK1 and ERK1 could be evaluated. Introducing tagged MEK1 into COS cells, stimulating the cells with TPA or EGF, immunoprecipitating the tagged MEK1, and measuring the MEK1 activity in vitro using recombinant GST-ERK1 as a substrate permitted us to monitor the activation of MEK1 in response to TPA. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of cells with TPA or EGF results in 5-6-fold activation of MEK1 within 10 min. Furthermore, the co-expression of c-Raf potentiates the activation of MEK1 by TPA. The potentiation of MEK1 by c-Raf co-expression was also seen following EGF treatment, although the response was weaker. These results are consistent with previous observations that TPA-stimulated ERK activation is potentiated by the overexpression of c-Raf (19Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) and that the N-terminal fragment of c-Raf or the point mutant of c-Raf (K375W) suppresses the TPA-induced mobility shift of ERKs (21Ming X.F.

Furthermore, the results demonstrate that this system can be used for the analysis of the Raf-dependent pathway for MEK1 and ERK1 activation. To examine the involvement of Ras in the above system, we used a dominant-negative Ras mutant, Ki-RasN17. As shown in Fig. 1A, RasN17 only slightly suppresses the TPA-induced activation of MEK1, whereas it completely suppresses the EGF-induced activation of MEK1. Similar results were also obtained for ERK1 in COS cells and NIH3T3 cells, as shown in Fig. 1, B and C, where tagged ERK1 was used instead of tagged MEK1, and the upward shift in the electrophoretic mobility of tagged ERK1 was evaluated using an anti-ERK antibody. These results confirm the previous observations that the activation of ERKs by TPA depends on c-Raf but not on Ras (19Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 21Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Since PKC is the major receptor for phorbol esters, PKC is the most obvious candidate for the substance that mediates the TPA-induced activation of MEK and ERK shown above. However, there have been few in vivo demonstrations that any PKC members are actually involved in the signaling pathway. Only PKCβ1 has been reported to potentiate the TPA-induced activation of c-Raf when overexpressed in insect cells (24Marquardt B. Frith D. Stabel S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3213-3218PubMed Google Scholar). To address this issue, we next examined the effect of a series of kinase-knockout point mutants of PKC isozymes expressed ubiquitously in a wide variety of cells, including COS and NIH3T3 cells. We introduced a series of PKC kinase-knockout mutants into COS cells and evaluated their effects on TPA-induced MEK1 activation. The kinase-knockout mutants were designed to have “activated conformation” by introducing mutation(s) into the pseudosubstrate region (see “Discussion”). Fig. 2 shows that the overexpression of the kinase-knockout mutants of PKCα, PKCδ, and PKCϵ all produce inhibition of the TPA-induced activation of MEK1 in a dose-dependent manner. However, this inhibition is incomplete at the highest DNA amount when the amount of the mutants was more than 100 times relative to their corresponding counterparts (Fig. 2D). The results suggest that PKC and/or its homologue is involved the signaling pathway from TPA to MEK1 activation. However, the results raise the question of the specificity of the kinase-knockout mutants on the action of each respective PKC isotype. To examine the specificity of the action of each PKC isotype directly, we next tried to determine the effect of the overexpression of PKC members on the TPA-induced activation of MEK1 and ERK1. However, we failed to detect any significant effect (data not shown), suggesting that the amount of endogenous PKC in COS and NIH3T3 cells is sufficient to mediate the TPA-induced activation of MEK1 and ERK1. Thus, we next constructed a series of constitutively active PKC mutants (Fig. 3A). PKCα (αR22A/A25E) has two point mutations in its pseudosubstrate region. The kinase activity of the mutant was evaluated after immunoprecipitation and showed clearly that PKCα (αR22A/A25E) is fully active in the absence of cofactors (Fig. 3B). The introduction of the PKCα mutant with reporter plasmids containing TPA response elements (TRE-luciferase) resulted in gene expression without TPA stimulation (data not shown), consistent with the results of the in vitro kinase assay. PKCδ (DR144/145A) also contains two point mutations and is fully active without cofactors (Fig. 3C). This is consistent with the previous observation that the introduction of PKCδ (DR144/145A) into NIH3T3 cells results in the activation of reporter gene expression (TRE-tk-CAT) without any stimuli (44Hirai S. Izumi Y. Higa K. Kaibuchi K. Mizuno K. Osada S. Suzuki K. Ohno S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2231-2340Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PKCϵ (ϵA159E) contains a point mutation in its pseudosubstrate region. The in vitro kinase assay using immunoprecipitated PKCϵ failed because of the absence of an antibody able to immunoprecipitate PKCϵ and monitor its kinase activity in a cofactor-dependent manner. However, the same mutant has been shown to be apparently constitutively active when monitored in terms of reporter gene expression (45Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).

We have partially purified a Cdc42- and Rac1-associated protein with molecular mass of about 170 kDa (p170) from bovine brain cytosol. This protein interacted with guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS)·glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Cdc42 and GTPγS·GST-Rac1 but not with the GDP·GST-Cdc42, GDP·GST-Rac1, or GTPγS·GST-RhoA). We identified p170 as an IQGAP, which is originally identified as a putative Ras GTPase-activating protein. Recombinant IQGAP specifically interacted with GTPγS·Cdc42 and GTPγS·Rac1. The C-terminal fragment of IQGAP was responsible for their interactions. IQGAP was specifically immunoprecipitated with dominant-active Cdc42Val12 or Rac1Val12 from the COS7 cells expressing Cdc42Val12 or Rac1Val12, respectively. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that IQGAP was accumulated at insulin- or Rac1-induced membrane ruffling areas. This accumulation of IQGAP was blocked by the microinjection of the dominant-negative Rac1Asn17 or Cdc42Asn17. Moreover, IQGAP was accumulated at the cell-cell junction in MDCK cells, where α-catenin and ZO-1 were localized. These results suggest that IQGAP is a novel target molecule for Cdc42 and Rac1.

Res. 1995; 41: 153-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The peptide sequence of p170 was determined as described (37Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Anti-IQGAP polyclonal antibody was raised by standard procedures using GST-IQGAP (521-914 amino acids) as an antigen. To identify Cdc42- and Rac1-interacting molecules, the bovine brain cytosol was loaded onto a GST-Cdc42 affinity column. The proteins bound to the affinity column were coeluted with GST-Cdc42 by the addition of glutathione. A protein with molecular mass of about 170 kDa (p170) was detected in the glutathione-eluate from GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 affinity column but not from GST or GDP·GST-Cdc42 affinity column (Fig. 1). Less amount of p170 was detected in the eluate from the GTPγS·GST-Rac1 affinity column but not from the GDP·GST-Rac1 affinity column. To further confirm the specificity of the interaction, affinity column chromatography using GST-RhoA was performed (29Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). p170 was not eluted from the GTPγS·GST-RhoA affinity column. p170 was eluted from neither GST-Ha-Ras nor GST-RalA affinity columns (data not shown). Proteins with molecular masses of 62 kDa (p62), 90 kDa (p90), and 110 kDa (p110) were also detected in both of the eluates from GTPγS·GST-Rac1 and GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 affinity columns. p62 was recognized by anti-PAK antibody (data not shown). Proteins with molecular masses of 122 kDa (p122) and 140 kDa (p140) were specifically detected in the eluate of GTPγS·GST-Rac1. Identifications of p90, p110, p122, and p140 are currently under investigation. 2Identifications of p90, p110, p122, and p140 will be described elsewhere. To identify the p170, it was subjected to amino acid sequencing as described (42Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Three peptide sequences derived from p170 were determined. The amino acid sequences of the peptides are YGEQVDYYK, IFYPETTDIYDRK, and RLIVDVIRFQPGETLTEILE. All of the three peptide sequences obtained were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence of human IQGAP, which is identified as a Ras GAP family (32Nomura N. Nagase T. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Seki N. Kawarabayasi Y. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, p170 was recognized by anti-IQGAP antibody (data not shown). The molecular weight of IQGAP is calculated to be 189,249, which is almost the same as the apparent molecular mass of p170 estimated by SDS-PAGE. We, therefore, concluded that p170 was a bovine counterpart of human IQGAP and hereafter refer to it as IQGAP. To examine whether recombinant IQGAP interacts with GTPγS·Cdc42 or GTPγS·Rac1, the affinity beads coated with GST-small GTPases were mixed with in vitro translated IQGAP. After washing the affinity beads, GST-small GTPases were eluted by the addition of glutathione. In vitro translated IQGAP coeluted strongly with GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 or GTPγS·GST-Rac1 (Fig. 2A). It was slightly retained on and eluted from the GDP·GST-Cdc42 affinity beads, but it was not detected in the eluate of GDP·GST-Rac1, GST-RhoA, or GST affinity beads. To determine the binding domain of IQGAP to Cdc42 and Rac1, the N-terminal (1-863 amino acids) and the C-terminal (764-1657 amino acids) fragments of IQGAP were in vitro translated, and their interactions with Cdc42 and Rac1 were examined. The C-terminal fragment of IQGAP interacted with GTPγS·Cdc42 or GTPγS-Rac1 (Fig. 2B), whereas the N-terminal fragment did not (data not shown). Both fragments interacted with neither GST, GDP·Cdc42, nor GDP·Rac1. Furthermore, direct interaction of the purified IQGAP with GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 or GTPγS·GST-Rac1 was examined using the overlay assay method (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 30Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS·GST-Cdc42 and [35S]GTPγS·GST-Rac1 bound to the purified IQGAP, whereas [35S]GTPγS·GST-RhoA did not (Fig. 2C). The consensus sequence of the Cdc42- or Rac1-binding domain of target proteins, such as PAK or WASP, has been determined and was termed as CRIB (25Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar, 43Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). There is no CRIB domain in the fragment (764-1657 amino acids). Therefore, Cdc42 or Rac1 interacts with at least two distinct target interfaces. We next examined whether IQGAP interacts with Cdc42 or Rac1 in vivo. Cdc42Val12 and Rac1Val12, structurally equivalent to RasVal12 (18Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2652) Google Scholar), are thought to be a constitutively GTP-bound form in vivo as a result of defective GTPase activity (3Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A.

Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), are thought to be a constitutively GDP-bound form in vivo (3Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3039) Google Scholar) as a result of preferential binding to GDP relative to GTP and to specifically interfere in the activation of endogenous respective small GTPases. When HA-tagged Cdc42Val12, Cdc42, Cdc42Asn17, Rac1Val12, or RhoAVal14 was transiently transfected into COS7 cells and HA-small GTPases were immunoprecipitated by anti-HA antibody, IQGAP was coimmunoprecipitated with Cdc42Val12 or Rac1Val12 (Fig. 3). It coimmunoprecipitated with neither Cdc42, Cdc42Asn17, nor RhoAVal14. Almost the same amounts of the HA-small GTPases were precipitated (data not shown). Therefore, it is most likely that IQGAP specifically interacts with GTP·Cdc42 and GTP·Rac1 in vivo. IQGAP was originally identified as a Ras GAP, but the recombinant IQGAP did not show any GAP activity toward Ras and Rho (33Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.-X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also attempted to detect GAP activity using affinity-purified IQGAP toward Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, R-Ras, RalA, Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA but failed (data not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that the purified IQGAP lost its activity. Further study is necessary to clarify the function of the GAP domain of IQGAP. Insulin is shown to induce membrane ruffling in KB cells (45Goshima K. Masuda A. Owaribe K. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 46Kadowaki T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. Tobe K. Izumi T. Takaku F. Sakai H. Yahara I. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7342-7350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the insulin-induced membrane ruffling is blocked by the prior microinjection of Rac1Asn17 into the cells but not by that of C3 (6Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Microinjection of GTPγS·Rac1 is shown to induce the membrane ruffling in KB cells (6Nishiyama T. Sasaki T. Takaishi K. Kato M. Yaku H. Araki K. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2447-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Then, we examined the localization of IQGAP in KB cells. When KB cells were stimulated with insulin, membrane ruffling was induced, and IQGAP accumulated at the membrane ruffling area (Fig. 4, A and B). The insulin-induced membrane ruffling and IQGAP accumulation at the membrane ruffling area were blocked by prior microinjection of Rac1Asn17 (Fig. 4, C and D). The prior microinjection of Cdc42Asn17 also blocked the insulin-induced membrane ruffling and the IQGAP accumulation in some injected cells (Fig. 4, E and F), whereas both processes weakly occurred in other injected cells. Cdc42Asn17 may not completely block insulin-dependent activation of endogenous Rac1. The prior microinjection of C3 did not block the insulin-induced membrane ruffling and IQGAP accumulation (Fig. 4, G and H). Microinjection of Rac1Val12 induced membrane ruffling and IQGAP accumulation at the membrane ruffling area (Fig. 4, I and J). That of Cdc42Val12 induced filopodia formation, but IQGAP was not accumulated at the filopodia (data not shown). It should be noted that IQGAP was accumulated at the cell-cell junction of KB cells. To further examine the IQGAP accumulation at the cell-cell junction, we examined the localization of IQGAP in MDCK cells. IQGAP was specifically accumulated at the cell-cell junction (Fig. 5, B and E). IQGAP showed similar distribution as α-catenin and ZO-1, which are marker molecules of adherence junction and tight junction, respectively, at the cell-cell junction (Fig. 5, C and F). It seems that IQGAP is well colocalized with α-catenin, whereas IQGAP is not completely colocalized with ZO-1. It remains to be clarified whether IQGAP is localized at the adherence junction or tight junction in MDCK cells. 3A detailed analysis will be described elsewhere. This observation suggests that IQGAP regulates the cell-cell junction, or that the cell-cell junctional signal leads to the IQGAP-accumulation.3 This accumulation was not affected by the addition of insulin or by microinjection of various small GTPases. It is possible that Rac1 or Cdc42 is not necessary for the localization of IQGAP at the cell-cell junction once IQGAP is complexed with the cell-cell junctional cytoskeleton, or that activation of Rac1 or Cdc42 at the cell-cell junction is blocked by neither Rac1Asn17 nor Cdc42Asn17. When actin filament was visualized with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin, IQGAP was observed in association with cortical actin at the membrane ruffling area in KB cells (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Colocalization of IQGAP with actin filament at the insulin-induced membrane ruffling area in KB cells. KB cells were starved for 36 h and stimulated with 1 μ insulin. Five minutes after the stimulation, cells were fixed and doubly stained with anti-IQGAP antibody and rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. A, phase-contrast microscopy. B and C, fluorescence microscopy. B, with anti-IQGAP antibody. C, with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin.

We showed that recombinant IQGAP directly interacts with active forms of Rac1 and Cdc42 in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we found that IQGAP is accumulated at the insulin- or Rac1-induced membrane ruffling area, and that the insulin-induced membrane ruffling and the IQGAP accumulation at the membrane ruffling area is blocked by the prior microinjection of Rac1Asn17 or Cdc42Asn17. Our results indicate that IQGAP is the target for Rac1 and Cdc42 and suggest that IQGAP is involved in the insulin- and Rac1-induced membrane ruffling. The targets for Cdc42 and Rac1 are identified as PAK (19Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 20Manser E. Chong C.

We showed that IQGAP is accumulated at the insulin- or Rac1-induced membrane ruffling area. On the basis of these observations, it is likely that the target molecules for Rac1 and Cdc42, including IQGAP, have distinct roles, and that IQGAP functions in concert with other targets, resulting in the exertion of pleiotropic functions of Rac1 and Cdc42.

Peptidoglycan also induced activation of NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α in macrophage RAW264.7 cells. These peptidoglycan-induced effects (in contrast to endotoxin-induced effects) were not inhibited by polymyxin B. Both peptidoglycan- and endotoxin-induced activation of NF-κB were inhibited by anti-CD14 mAb. The N-terminal 151 amino acids of CD14 were sufficient for acquisition of full responsiveness to both peptidoglycan and endotoxin, but CD14 deletion mutants lacking four small regions within the N-terminal 65 amino acids showed differentially diminished responses to peptidoglycan and endotoxin. These results identify CD14 as the functional receptor for peptidoglycan and demonstrate that similar, but not identical sequences in the N-terminal 65-amino acid region of CD14 are critical for the NF-κB and IgM responses to both peptidoglycan and endotoxin.

PGN is especially abundant in Gram-positive bacteria, in which it accounts for half of the mass of their cell wall (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Host cells are exposed to large amounts of insoluble PGN in the form of cell wall debris that are deposited at the sites of infection (2Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davies M. Immunology of the Bacterial Cell Envelope. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 11Google Scholar), and also to polymeric uncross-linked soluble PGN (sPGN) fragments that are released from bacteria in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics (3Mirelman D. Bracha R. Sharon N. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 4Zeiger A.R. Wong W. Chatterjee A.N. Young F.E. Tuazon C.U. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PGN, similarly to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the cell walls of Gram-negative bacteria, can reproduce most of the clinical manifestations of bacterial infections, including fever, acute-phase response, inflammation, septic shock, leukocytosis, sleepiness, malaise, abscess formation, and arthritis. Most of these effects are due to the release of cytokines and other mediators from macrophages and other cells (2Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davies M.

Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and binding of PGN to CD14-positive monocytes 2B. Weidemann, R. Dziarski, S. Kusumoto, E. T. Reitschel, H. D. Flad, and A. J. Ulmer, submitted for publication. were inhibited by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies and LPS partial structures, such as an LPS antagonist, compound 406. These results strongly indicated that CD14 serves as a cell-activating receptor not only for LPS but also for PGN.Here we further test the hypothesis that CD14 is a functional PGN receptor, using mouse 70Z/3 cells stably expressing recombinant human CD14 (70Z/3-hCD14 transfectants). 70Z/3 cells are CD14-negative immature B cells that do not express surface IgM (sIgM) and are unresponsive to PGN and responsive only to high concentrations of LPS. 70Z/3-hCD14 transfectants express GPI-bound hCD14 and become highly responsive to low concentrations of LPS (19Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal 151-amino acid fragment of hCD14 serves as a fully functional LPS receptor (20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of these cells results in activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and differentiation into more mature B cells that express sIgM (19Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is sequestered in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitory protein, IκB (21Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB activation involves degradation of IκB in the cytoplasm and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (21Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

In this study, we used the above criteria (translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, degradation of IκB-α in the cytoplasm, and expression of sIgM) to measure activation of 70Z/3-hCD14 cells by PGN and LPS.DISCUSSIONOur results strongly support the hypothesis that CD14 is a functional receptor for both insoluble and soluble staphylococcal PGN, as well as for PGN-containing streptococcal cell walls. They also demonstrate that less than half of membrane CD14 (the N-terminal 151 amino acids) is sufficient for full function of CD14 as a cell-activating PGN receptor, and that the sequences that are most critical for the receptor function of CD14 are located within the N-terminal 65 amino acid region.These results support the hypothesis proposed earlier by us (17Weidemann B. Brade H. Reitschel E.T. Dziarski R. Bazil V. Kusumoto S. Flad H.-D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3T. N.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 6-8PubMed Google Scholar) that CD14 functions not only as an LPS receptor, but also as a receptor for PGN and other bacterial cell wall components. The domain of CD14 that is critical for its function as a receptor for both PGN and LPS is located within the N-terminal 65-amino acid region. The specific amino acid sequences responsible for the function of CD14 as a receptor for both PGN and LPS are similar, but not identical. In agreement with the previous studies (13Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) we confirmed that the AVEVE and PQPD sequences are most crucial for the responsiveness to LPS and that their deletion can almost totally abolish or severely diminish the function of CD14 as an LPS receptor. Single deletions of these sequences only partially diminish the responsiveness to PGN, and deletion of all four studied sequences (DDED, PQPD, DPRQY, and AVEVE) is required to abolish the responsiveness to PGN.The differences between the responses of CD14 mutants to PGN and LPS were consistently observed in several experiments, and they may be due to fine differences in the binding of PGN and LPS to CD14 and/or due to the differences in the requirement for LBP. LBP greatly enhances the responses of CD14-positive cells to low concentrations of LPS (10Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Immunol. 1992; 149: 200-206PubMed Google Scholar) macrophages or 70Z/3-hCD14 transfectants3 to PGN. These differences may also be due to the post-binding events that are responsible for signal transduction from the receptor and cell activation. The latter notion is supported by our recent discovery that three families of mitogen-activated protein kinases are differentially activated by PGN and LPS in mouse macrophages (36Dziarski R. Jin Y. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PGN strongly activates ERK1 and ERK2, moderately activates JNK, and weakly activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, in contrast to LPS, which strongly activates all of these kinases (36Dziarski R. Jin Y. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The effects of deletion mutations on NF-κB activation (Fig. 9) were usually more severe and clear-cut than the effects on sIgM expression (Fig. 8), e.g. a single ΔPQPD deletion was sufficient to abrogate NF-κB, but not sIgM responses to LPS. These differences most likely reflect the differences in the assay systems and in the requirements for sIgM expression and NF-κB activation, i.e. long stimulation period and likely activation of multiple signal transduction molecules that are required for induction of sIgM. For example, induction of the κ chains in 70Z/3 cells requires activation of at least two transcription factors, NF-κB and OTF-2 (37Rooney J.W. Emery D.W. Sibley C.H. Immunogenetics. 1990; 31: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The sequences in CD14 that are most critical for the responsiveness to LPS and PGN are hydrophilic and they would be expected to be exposed on the surface of CD14, and thus be available for binding of ligands. These results are consistent with the proposal that LPS binds to the hydrophilic region(s) of CD14 (38Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Zahringer U. Kirikae F. Brade H. Kusama T. Rietchel E.T. FEMS Immun. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 8: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Comparing the structure of PGN and lipid A (the active part of LPS) (17Weidemann B. Brade H. Reitschel E.T. Dziarski R. Bazil V. Kusumoto S. Flad H.-D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the only similar parts of the molecules are the (GlcNAc-MurNAc)n backbone of PGN and the (GlcNAc)2 part of lipid A. Because of the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acids in lipid A, in aqueous solutions, lipid A forms aggregates with hydrophilic (GlcNAc)2 exposed on the surface and available for binding to CD14. Therefore, it appears that polysaccharide portions of PGN and lipid A may be involved in binding to CD14.In addition to identifying CD14 as a PGN receptor, our results also demonstrate for the first time that PGN induces activation of transcription factor NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α in both macrophages and in 70Z/3-CD14 transfectants, and expression of surface IgM in 70Z/3-CD14 transfectants. These results extend a previous observation of NF-κB activation in human monocytes by a low molecular weight anhydro monomer derivative of PGN (18Dokter W.H.A. Dijkstra A.J. Koopmans S.B. Stulp B.K.

PGN is especially abundant in Gram-positive bacteria, in which it accounts for half of the mass of their cell wall (1Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol.

Host cells are exposed to large amounts of insoluble PGN in the form of cell wall debris that are deposited at the sites of infection (2Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S.

Most of these effects are due to the release of cytokines and other mediators from macrophages and other cells (2Heymer B. Seidl P.H. Schleifer K.H. Stewart-Tull D.E.S. Davies M.

Our recent results showed that activation of CD14-positive monocytes by PGN (17Weidemann B. Brade H. Reitschel E.T. Dziarski R. Bazil V. Kusumoto S. Flad H.-D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and binding of PGN to CD14-positive monocytes 2B. Weidemann, R. Dziarski, S. Kusumoto, E. T. Reitschel, H. D. Flad, and A. J. Ulmer, submitted for publication. were inhibited by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies and LPS partial structures, such as an LPS antagonist, compound 406. These results strongly indicated that CD14 serves as a cell-activating receptor not only for LPS but also for PGN. Here we further test the hypothesis that CD14 is a functional PGN receptor, using mouse 70Z/3 cells stably expressing recombinant human CD14 (70Z/3-hCD14 transfectants). 70Z/3 cells are CD14-negative immature B cells that do not express surface IgM (sIgM) and are unresponsive to PGN and responsive only to high concentrations of LPS. 70Z/3-hCD14 transfectants express GPI-bound hCD14 and become highly responsive to low concentrations of LPS (19Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal 151-amino acid fragment of hCD14 serves as a fully functional LPS receptor (20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stimulation of these cells results in activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and differentiation into more mature B cells that express sIgM (19Lee J.D. Kato K. Tobias P.S. Kirkland T.N. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 20Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 653-656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is sequestered in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitory protein, IκB (21Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB activation involves degradation of IκB in the cytoplasm and translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus (21Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev.

In this study, we used the above criteria (translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, degradation of IκB-α in the cytoplasm, and expression of sIgM) to measure activation of 70Z/3-hCD14 cells by PGN and LPS. DISCUSSIONOur results strongly support the hypothesis that CD14 is a functional receptor for both insoluble and soluble staphylococcal PGN, as well as for PGN-containing streptococcal cell walls. They also demonstrate that less than half of membrane CD14 (the N-terminal 151 amino acids) is sufficient for full function of CD14 as a cell-activating PGN receptor, and that the sequences that are most critical for the receptor function of CD14 are located within the N-terminal 65 amino acid region.These results support the hypothesis proposed earlier by us (17Weidemann B.

The domain of CD14 that is critical for its function as a receptor for both PGN and LPS is located within the N-terminal 65-amino acid region. The specific amino acid sequences responsible for the function of CD14 as a receptor for both PGN and LPS are similar, but not identical. In agreement with the previous studies (13Viriyakosol S. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 361-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) we confirmed that the AVEVE and PQPD sequences are most crucial for the responsiveness to LPS and that their deletion can almost totally abolish or severely diminish the function of CD14 as an LPS receptor. Single deletions of these sequences only partially diminish the responsiveness to PGN, and deletion of all four studied sequences (DDED, PQPD, DPRQY, and AVEVE) is required to abolish the responsiveness to PGN.The differences between the responses of CD14 mutants to PGN and LPS were consistently observed in several experiments, and they may be due to fine differences in the binding of PGN and LPS to CD14 and/or due to the differences in the requirement for LBP. LBP greatly enhances the responses of CD14-positive cells to low concentrations of LPS (10Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

These differences may also be due to the post-binding events that are responsible for signal transduction from the receptor and cell activation. The latter notion is supported by our recent discovery that three families of mitogen-activated protein kinases are differentially activated by PGN and LPS in mouse macrophages (36Dziarski R. Jin Y. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PGN strongly activates ERK1 and ERK2, moderately activates JNK, and weakly activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, in contrast to LPS, which strongly activates all of these kinases (36Dziarski R. Jin Y. Gupta D. J. Infect. Dis. 1996; 174 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The effects of deletion mutations on NF-κB activation (Fig. 9) were usually more severe and clear-cut than the effects on sIgM expression (Fig. 8), e.g. a single ΔPQPD deletion was sufficient to abrogate NF-κB, but not sIgM responses to LPS. These differences most likely reflect the differences in the assay systems and in the requirements for sIgM expression and NF-κB activation, i.e. long stimulation period and likely activation of multiple signal transduction molecules that are required for induction of sIgM. For example, induction of the κ chains in 70Z/3 cells requires activation of at least two transcription factors, NF-κB and OTF-2 (37Rooney J.W. Emery D.W. Sibley C.H. Immunogenetics. 1990; 31: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The sequences in CD14 that are most critical for the responsiveness to LPS and PGN are hydrophilic and they would be expected to be exposed on the surface of CD14, and thus be available for binding of ligands. These results are consistent with the proposal that LPS binds to the hydrophilic region(s) of CD14 (38Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Zahringer U. Kirikae F. Brade H. Kusama T. Rietchel E.T. FEMS Immun. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 8: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Comparing the structure of PGN and lipid A (the active part of LPS) (17Weidemann B. Brade H. Reitschel E.T. Dziarski R. Bazil V. Kusumoto S. Flad H.-D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4709-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the only similar parts of the molecules are the (GlcNAc-MurNAc)n backbone of PGN and the (GlcNAc)2 part of lipid A. Because of the hydrophobic nature of the fatty acids in lipid A, in aqueous solutions, lipid A forms aggregates with hydrophilic (GlcNAc)2 exposed on the surface and available for binding to CD14. Therefore, it appears that polysaccharide portions of PGN and lipid A may be involved in binding to CD14.In addition to identifying CD14 as a PGN receptor, our results also demonstrate for the first time that PGN induces activation of transcription factor NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α in both macrophages and in 70Z/3-CD14 transfectants, and expression of surface IgM in 70Z/3-CD14 transfectants.

https://openalex.org/W2012961732,"Oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be of critical importance in triggering the pathological events of atherosclerosis. Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by phagocytes, is a potent catalyst for LDL oxidation in vitro, and active enzyme is present in human atherosclerotic lesions. We have explored the possibility that reactive intermediates generated by myeloperoxidase target LDL cholesterol for oxidation. LDL exposed to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system at acidic pH yielded a family of chlorinated sterols. The products were identified by mass spectrometry as a novel dichlorinated sterol, cholesterol α-chlorohydrin (6β-chlorocholestane-(3β,5α)-diol), cholesterol β-chlorohydrin (5α-chlorocholestane-(3β,6β)-diol), and a structurally related cholesterol chlorohydrin. Oxidation of LDL cholesterol by myeloperoxidase required H2O2 and Cl−, suggesting that hypochlorous acid (HOCl) was an intermediate in the reaction. However, HOCl failed to generate chlorinated sterols under chloride-free conditions. Since HOCl is in equilibrium with molecular chlorine (Cl2) through a reaction which requires Cl− and H+, this raised the possibility that Cl2 was the actual chlorinating intermediate. Consonant with this hypothesis, HOCl oxidized LDL cholesterol in the presence of Cl− and at acidic pH. Moreover, in the absence of Cl− and at neutral pH, Cl2 generated the same family of chlorinated sterols as the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system. Finally, direct addition of Cl2 to the double bond of cholesterol accounts for dichlorinated sterol formation by myeloperoxidase. Collectively, these results indicate that Cl2 derived from HOCl is the chlorinating intermediate in the oxidation of cholesterol by myeloperoxidase.

Thus, substantial evidence has accrued suggesting that myeloperoxidase contributes to atherogenesis by catalyzing oxidative reactions in the artery wall. Although lipoprotein oxidation is thought to be pivotal in the development of atherosclerosis, and LDL is the major carrier of cholesterol in blood, the role of cholesterol oxidation in atherogenesis has received little attention.

BioEssays. 1991; 13: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, the reaction pathways responsible for cholesterol oxidation in vivo have not yet been identified. We have used a synthetic lipid bilayer model system to demonstrate that myeloperoxidase converts cholesterol to chlorinated and oxygenated sterols (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Chlorinated sterols represent attractive candidates for monitoring phagocyte-mediated tissue damage because myeloperoxidase is the only human enzyme known to produce HOCl under physiological conditions (17Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Weiss S.J. Test S.T. Eckmann C.M. Ross D. Regiani S. Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the current study, we examine the ability of the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system of phagocytes to oxidize LDL cholesterol. We find that cholesterol is a major target for oxidation at acidic pH, yielding a family of oxidized sterols. The products were identified by mass spectrometry as a novel dichlorinated sterol, cholesterol α- and β-chlorohydrins, and a structurally related cholesterol chlorohydrin. We demonstrate further that LDL cholesterol oxidation is mediated by Cl2, which may arise either directly from HOCl or indirectly from a chloramine intermediate. Sodium hypochlorite, H2O2, organic solvents, and sodium phosphate were obtained from Fisher. Chelex-100 resin and catalase (bovine liver, thymol-free) were from Bio-Rad and Boehringer Mannheim, respectively. All other materials were purchased from Sigma except where indicated. Myeloperoxidase (donor: hydrogen peroxide, oxidoreductase, EC) was purified by lectin affinity and size exclusion chromatographies from human leukocytes obtained by leukopheresis (12Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Rakita R.M. Michel B.R. Rosen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Purified myeloperoxidase (A430 nm/A280 nm ratio of 0.6) was dialyzed against water and stored in 50% glycerol at −20°C. Enzyme concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ430 = 170 m−1 cm−1; Ref. 41Morita Y. Iwamoto H. Aibara S. Kobayashi T. Hasegawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out in chlorine-demand-free and chloride-free glassware (19Weil I. Morris J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 1664-1671Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Chloride-free sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was prepared by a modification of previous methods (42Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Reagent NaOCl (100 ml) mixed with 100 ml of ethyl acetate was protonated by dropwise addition of concentrated phosphoric acid (final pH ≤ 5). The organic phase containing HOCl was washed twice with H2O, and HOCl was re-extracted into H2O by the dropwise addition of NaOH (final pH ≥ 9). Residual ethyl acetate in the aqueous solution of chloride-free NaOCl was removed by bubbling with N2. The concentration of NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ292 = 350 −1 cm−1; Ref. 43Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Human LDL (d = 1.020-1.069 g/ml) was isolated by sequential density ultracentrifugation as described previously (44Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined utilizing the Markwell-modified Lowry protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (45Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). LDL was rendered chloride-free by exhaustive dialysis against buffer A (65 m sodium phosphate, 100 μ diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, pH 7.4). All incubations were performed in sealed, chlorine-demand-free and chloride-free reaction vials. [14C]Cholesterol-labeled LDL was prepared by addition of tracer quantities of [14C]cholesterol (DuPont NEN) in ethanol (<0.2% final concentration, v:v) to chloride-free LDL at 37°C. Following incubation for 5 min, the LDL was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on an Econopac 10-DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with H2O. Under these conditions >99% of [14C]cholesterol was incorporated into the LDL particle as determined by scintillation spectrometry and protein analysis of fractions prepared from the column. LDL was oxidized utilizing the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system, chloride-free NaOCl, or Cl2 as described in the Fig. legends. Following a 30-min incubation at 37°C, H2O saturated with NaCl (0.5 ml) was added to the reaction mixture (0.5 ml), and lipid soluble products were extracted by three sequential 2-ml additions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts were brought to near dryness under anhydrous N2 and immediately analyzed by normal-phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silicic acid (Silica Gel 60A Linear-K with preabsorbent strips; 250 μm; Whatman) with hexane:diethyl ether (40:60, v:v) as the mobile phase. TLC plates were developed twice and reaction products subsequently quantified by phosphor imaging (Molecular Dynamics). Under the conditions employed, radioactivity was a linear function of [14C]cholesterol and recovery of chlorinated sterols was ≥95%. The free cholesterol content of LDL preparations was determined by gas chromatography (46Sevanian A. Seraglia R. Traldi P. Rossato P. Ursini F. Hodis H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For experiments involving LDL oxidation with reagent molecular chlorine, Cl2 (Aldrich) was first purged into a vented gas-tight reservoir to one atmosphere of pressure, and a known quantity of Cl2 was then removed and added to a sealed reaction vial utilizing a gas-tight syringe rendered chlorine-demand-free. Synthesis of the monochloramine of Nα-acetyl–lysine (Sigma) was performed by dropwise addition of chloride-free NaOCl (1:1; mol:mol) to the N-blocked amino acid at 0°C in 10 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) with constant mixing. The solution was then warmed to 37°C for 15 min and its monochloramine content determined spectrophotometrically (42Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Preparations of monochloramine were free of excess HOCl as monitored by monochlorodimadone oxidation (17Harrison J.E. Schultz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1371-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 6β-Chlorocholestane-(3β,5α)-diol (α-chlorohydrin) and 5α-chlorocholestane-(3β,6β)-diol (β-chlorohydrin) were prepared from cholesterol α-epoxide and cholesterol β-epoxide, respectively (Research Plus Inc., Bayonne, NJ), with concentrated HCl utilizing a modification of the method of Maerker et al. (47Maerker G. Nungesster E.H. Bunick F.J. Lipids. 1988; 23: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) as described (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). LDL cholesterol oxidation products were purified by normal phase TLC and extracted into ethyl acetate prior to derivatization reactions. Trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives of hydroxylated compounds were formed with excess N, O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (Pierce) in pyridine (1:1, v:v) at 60°C for 15 min (49Turk J. Henderson W.R. Klebanoff S.J. Hubbard W.C. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 751: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Heptafluorobutyrate derivatives of hydroxylated compounds were prepared with excess heptafluorobutyric anhydride (Pierce) in acetonitrile (1:3, v:v) for 1 h at room temperature (12Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatized products were concentrated to dryness under anhydrous N2 and reconstituted in heptane for analysis. Base-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation of chlorohydrins to the corresponding epoxides was performed by treating the compounds with sodium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Mass spectra of standard cholesterol α- and β-chlorohydrins, cholesterol α- and β-epoxides, and the structurally related cholesterol chlorohydrin, Band 3, were performed as described previously (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectra were acquired on a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex Inc., Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) in positive-ion mode. The TLC extracts were diluted in chloroformml:methanol (1:1, v:v) containing 10 m ammonium acetate and were infused into the mass spectrometer at a rate of 4 μl/min. The electrospray interface was maintained at 5.0 kV with respect to ion entrance of the mass spectrometer. Air was used as the nebulizing gas. Product ion mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra of individual chlorinated sterols were acquired by accelerating their (M + NH4)+ through a 30-V potential difference into argon gas, which was maintained at a target thickness of 2.0 × 1014 atoms/cm2. The resulting fragment ions were mass-analyzed by scanning the third quadrupole in 0.1-amu increments from 15 amu through the mass of the precursor ion. At least 10 scans were averaged for each MS/MS spectrum. Precursor ion MS/MS spectra were acquired by scanning for (M + NH4)+ precursors that fragmented to m/z 367, a common fragment of chlorohydrins and other cholesterol species. The mass spectrometer was operated at unit mass resolution for all experiments to fully resolve individual chlorine isotopes of the chlorinated sterols. All glassware was rendered chlorine-demand-free (19Weil I. Morris J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 1664-1671Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and chloride-free by soaking in chloride-free NaOCl, extensive rinsing with H2O, and pyrolysis at 500°C overnight. Buffers were treated with Chelex-100 resin to remove transition metal ions and demonstrated to be chlorine-demand-free (defined as no detectable (<3%) consumption of 1 m HOCl in a 10-min incubation at 37°C within a gas-tight vial) as monitored by the oxidation of iodide to triiodide (50El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jurgens G. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multilamellar dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine vesicles (cholesterol:dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine; 3:7, mol:mol) were prepared utilizing a modification of the method of Sepe and Clark (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 48Sepe S.M. Clark R.A. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 1888-1895PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 concentration was determine spectrophotometrically (ϵ240 = 39.4 −1 cm−1; Ref. 51Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). To determine whether LDL cholesterol might serve as a substrate for oxidation by myeloperoxidase, we incubated [14C]cholesterol-labeled LDL with the complete myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system. Analysis of oxidation products by normal phase TLC and autoradiography revealed that LDL cholesterol was converted to a family of products (Fig. 1). Characterization of the oxidized sterols by GC-MS (Appendix) confirmed their structures as cholesterol α- and β-chlorohydrins (6β-chlorocholestane-3β,5α-diol and 5α-chlorocholestane-3β,6β-diol, respectively), cholesterol α- and β-epoxides (cholesterol 5α,6α-epoxide and cholesterol 5β,6β-epoxide, respectively), and a previously identified cholesterol chlorohydrin termed “Band 3,” which is structurally related to the α- and β-chlorohydrins (23Heinecke J.W. Li W. Mueller D.M. Boher A. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10127-10136Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A novel dichlorinated sterol designated “Rapidly Migrating Band” (Fig. 1) was also identified (see below). The principal products of the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reaction were the α- and β-cholesterol chlorohydrins and Band 3, which collectively constituted ∼80% of the oxidized sterols. Generation of the chlorinated and oxygenated sterols demonstrated an absolute requirement for the presence of Cl−, H2O2, and enzyme and was inhibited by the peroxide scavenger catalase. Furthermore, addition of either sodium azide or sodium cyanide, two heme protein poisons, inhibited chlorinated sterol generation, consistent with a peroxidase-dependent mechanism of generation (Fig. 1). When [14C]cholesterol-labeled LDL was treated with reagent HOCl in the presence of Cl−, the product yield was essentially identical to that generated by myeloperoxidase, strongly implicating HOCl in the reaction pathway. To determine whether the LDL cholesterol oxidation product designated “Rapidly Migrating Band” (Fig. 1) was chlorinated, the compound was subjected to electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. The positive ion mass spectrum of the ammoniated compound was that expected for a dichlorinated derivative of cholesterol (Fig. 2, inset) and contained a single major ion at m/z 474 (M + NH4)+. The mass spectrum (Fig. 2) also demonstrated the isotopic cluster expected for a dichlorinated sterol, with ions at m/z 474 ([M + NH4]+ for 35Cl2), 476 ([M + NH4]+ for 35Cl37Cl) and 478 ([M + NH4]+ for 37Cl2). Production scans of both the 35Cl2- and 37Cl2-containing precursor ions revealed fragmentation patterns consistent with the loss of two molecules of HCl, confirming the presence of two chlorine atoms per sterol nucleus in the Rapidly Migrating Band. Product ions observed in the mass spectrum of the precursor ion of m/z 474 ([M + NH4]+ for 35Cl2) included m/z 456 ([M + NH4]+− H2O), 420 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − H35Cl), 403 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − H35Cl − NH3) and 367 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − 2H35Cl − NH3). Product ions observed in the mass spectrum of the precursor ion of m/z 478 ([M + NH4]+ for 37Cl2) included m/z 460 ([M + NH4]+− H2O), 422 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − H37Cl), 405 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − H37Cl − NH3) and 367 ([M + NH4]+− H2O − 2H37Cl − NH3). These results indicate that the Rapidly Migrating Band is a novel dichlorinated sterol, and raise the possibility that the formation of the compound involves Cl2, which undergoes an addition reaction with the C5-C6 double bond of cholesterol. The reaction requirements for oxidation of LDL cholesterol by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system are illustrated in Fig. 3. Near-maximal chlorinated sterol production was seen at physiological Cl− concentrations (100 m) and in a pH range similar to that ultimately achieved in the phagolysosome (52Jensen M.S. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 53Lehrer R.I. Cech P. Blood. 1984; 63: 88-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions employed for these studies, up to 50% of the H2O2 in the reaction mixture was used by myeloperoxidase to generate chlorinated sterols from LDL cholesterol. The chlorinating intermediate generated by myeloperoxidase is generally thought to be HOCl or its conjugate base hypochlorite (ClO−; Refs. 19Weil I. Morris J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1949; 71: 1664-1671Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar and 43Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Crossref Scopus (816) Google Scholar). However, HOCl is also in equilibrium with Cl2 via a reaction that requires Cl− and H+ (54(1972) Handbook of Chlorination, pp. 182–227, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New YorkGoogle Scholar) (Equation 2). HOCl+H++Cl−=Cl2+H2O(Eq. 2) This observation, coupled with identification of the novel dichlorinated sterol, suggested that Cl2 might serve as the oxidizing intermediate in LDL cholesterol oxidation by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system. To determine whether HOCl or Cl2 was the chlorinating intermediate in cholesterol oxidation, we first examined the Cl− and H+ dependence of the reaction using HOCl and [14C]cholesterol-labeled LDL. According to Equation 2, no Cl2 should be generated from HOCl in the absence of Cl−. Remarkably, [14C]cholesterol failed to undergo oxidation when LDL was incubated with HOCl in the absence of Cl− (Fig. 4, right panel). In striking contrast, [14C]cholesterol-labeled LDL exposed to HOCl in the presence of Cl− yielded large quantities of chlorinated radiolabeled sterols (Fig. 4, left panel). Moreover, the reaction was optimal under acidic conditions. The acidic pH optimum and Cl− dependence of LDL cholesterol oxidation by HOCl is consistent with a requirement for the equilibrium-driven formation of Cl2 as the halogenating intermediate (Equation 2). To investigate further whether Cl2 or HOCl served as the reactive intermediate in cholesterol oxidation, we compared the ability of equimolar amounts of Cl2 and chloride-free HOCl to chlorinate LDL cholesterol (Fig. 5). At neutral pH and under chloride-free conditions, incubation with Cl2, but not an equimolar amount of HOCl, resulted in oxidation and chlorination of LDL cholesterol. Collectively, these results suggest that Cl2-derived from myeloper"

In addition, this transient rise in [Ca2+]cyt is initially insensitive to 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), an extracellular calcium chelator. However, BAPTA abruptly attenuates the maintenance of that transient rise. These data show that hypotonic shock generates a stretch-activated channel-dependent calcium pulse in yeast. They also suggest that the immediate calcium influx is primarily generated from intracellular stores, and that a sustained increase in [Ca2+]cyt depends upon extracellular calcium. We have used the transgenic AEQUORIN calcium reporter system to monitor the cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to hypotonic shock.

https://openalex.org/W1986105465,"We report the isolation of a novel mouse gene which encodes a putative hyaluronan synthase. The cDNA was identified using degenerate reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Degenerate primers were designed based upon an alignment of the amino acid sequences of Streptococcus pyogenes HasA, Xenopus laevis DG42, and Rhizobium meliloti NodC. A mouse embryo cDNA library was screened with the resultant polymerase chain reaction product, and multiple cDNA clones spanning 3 kilobase pairs (kb) were isolated. The open reading frame predicted a 63-kDa protein with several transmembrane sequences, multiple consensus phosphorylation sites, and four putative hyaluronan binding motifs. The amino acid sequence displayed 55% identity to mouse HAS, 56% identity to Xenopus DG42, and 21% identity to Streptococcus HasA. Northern analysis identified transcripts of 4.8 kb and 3.2 kb, which were expressed highly in the developing mouse embryo and at lower levels in adult mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle. Transfection experiments demonstrated that mouse Has2 could direct hyaluronan coat biosynthesis in transfected COS cells, as evidenced by a classical particle exclusion assay. These results suggest that mammalian HA synthase activity is regulated by at least two related genes. Accordingly, we propose the name Has2 for this gene.

More than 60 years after the isolation of hyaluronan from the vitreous humor (1Meyer K. Palmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1934; 107: 629-634Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), its synthetic pathway remains incompletely characterized. HA is synthesized as a free, linear polymer at the inner face of the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells and is subsequently extruded to the outside of the cell (2Prehm P. Biochem.

Asplund T. Yamashita H. Heldin C.H. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Certain bacteria can synthesize an HA polymer that is identical to the polymer synthesized by mammalian cells (10Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect.

Indeed, investigation of HA biosynthesis in the Group A Streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, has recently led to the identification and cloning of several genes that encode enzymes critical for HA biosynthesis in this bacterium (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, until very recently, no genes have been identified that encode enzymes with similar activities in mammalian cells. hyaluronan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction open reading frame cytomegalovirus promoter phosphate-buffered saline untranslated region protein kinase C protein kinase A UDP-N-acetylglucosamine UDP-glucuronic acid days postcoitum base pair(s) kilobase(s) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Degenerate reverse transcriptase-PCR has been a useful tool in the identification and cloning of many genes and gene families (13Pytela R. Suzuki S. Breuss J. Erle D.J. Sheppard D.

Commun. 1995; 212: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This approach relies upon conserved sequences deduced from alignments of related gene or protein sequences. The hasA gene of S. pyogenes encodes hyaluronan synthase in this bacterium (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts that this protein is a membrane protein with a large intracellular loop encoding the active site of the enzyme (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, in mammalian cells, the HA synthase has been localized to the plasma membrane, with the active site on the inner face of the membrane (4Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1023-5017Google Scholar, 5Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Data base searches have identified the Rhizobium sp. nodulation factor C (NodC) proteins, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chitin synthase 2 (Chs2) proteins, and the Xenopus laevis DG42 protein as sharing sequence identity with HasA (16DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that there might be HasA/DG42-related genes in mammals that play a role in HA biosynthesis. Accordingly, we utilized the aligned amino acid sequences of HasA, DG42, and NodC to design a degenerate RT-PCR strategy to successfully identify a HasA/DG42-related cDNA in the mouse. Surprisingly, the deduced sequence predicted from this cDNA is distinct from that of a recently reported mouse HAS cDNA (17Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), although the sequences are clearly related. Accordingly, we have designated this novel mouse gene, Has2, hyaluronan synthase 2. Transfection of mouse Has2 expression constructs into COS cells allowed them to synthesize HA, as determined through an HA coat assay. The identification and cloning of the second putative mammalian HA synthase gene will be instrumental in our future understanding of HA biosynthesis and function. Degenerate oligonucleotide primer pools were designed based upon an alignment of the X. laevis DG42 amino acid sequence with the S. pyogenes HasA and the Rhizobium meliloti NodC amino acid sequence (16DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Three degenerate pools were designed, two of which were predicted to anneal on the antisense strand and one on the sense strand. The oligonucleotides were made corresponding to the peptide sequences AFNVERACQ, GDDRHLTN, and QQTRWTKSYF and had the following degenerate sequences: DEG 1 primer, 5′-GCN TTY AAY GTN GAR MGN GCN TGY CA 3′ (sense strand), DEG 3 primer, 5′-RTT NGT NAR RTG NCK RTC RTC NCC-3′ (antisense strand), and DEG 5 primer, 5′-RAA RTA NSW YTT NGT CCA NCK NGT YTG YTG-3′ (antisense strand). RNA was isolated using TriZOL™ reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. Reverse transcription reactions were performed on total RNA isolated from 10.5 and 14.5 days postcoitum (dpc) C57BL/6J mouse embryos. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA were heat-denatured at 95°C, then split into two separate reactions. One reaction served as a control and amplified a fragment of 28 S ribosomal RNA. The second reaction received one of two degenerate primer pools at a final concentration of 2 μ. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42°C using 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 25 μl. Five microliters of each resultant first-strand cDNA were amplified in separate 100-μl PCR reactions using combinations of degenerate primer pools. Amplification conditions were as follows: 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension of 72°C for 10 min. Primer pools were used at a final concentration of 1 μ. Twenty microliters of each PCR reaction was separated through a 2.0% agarose gel. Amplified products (Fig. 1A) were gel-purified and ligated directly into a pBluescript KSII+ (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA) T-vector prepared as described (18Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Resultant plasmids were sequenced by dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded plasmid DNAs using a Sequenase Version 2.0 sequencing kit (United States Biochemical Corp.). A 300-bp cDNA fragment, MHas300, isolated through degenerate RT-PCR, was utilized as a probe to screen a primary λgt10 cDNA library constructed from 8.5-dpc C57BL/6J poly(A)+ RNA (kindly provided by Dr. J. J. Lee, Mayo Clinic Scottsdale). The probe was labeled to high specific activity using random-priming in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 132: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Approximately 1.5 × 106 plaque-forming units were screened using standard procedures (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Sping Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Double-positive plaques were identified and taken through two additional rounds of plaque purification. In addition, a portion of each primary plaque was screened by PCR to determine insert size relative to the MHas300 cDNA fragment. This was carried out through a combination of primers that flanked the λgt10 cloning site and MHas2 specific primers. Fourteen positive clones were obtained and analyzed. EcoRI restriction fragments were subcloned into pBluescript KSII+ for sequence analysis. Sequence was determined from both strands using synthetic oligonucleotide primers made to the mouse Has2 sequence and to the vector. Mouse multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the 1.65-kb open reading frame (ORF) of the mouse Has2 gene. Blots were hybridized at 42°C and washed to high stringency according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were exposed at −70°C to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with intensifying screens. To control for variation in loading, blots were stripped and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled probe for the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene. Mouse 129Sv/J genomic DNA was prepared from tail snips using standard procedures. Approximately 15-μg samples of genomic DNA were digested overnight with restriction endonucleases, size-separated through 0.8% agarose gels, and transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes (Amersham). Membranes were hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the 1.65-kb ORF of mouse Has2. Hybridization conditions were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were washed to low (1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 37°C) and high (0.1 × SSC + 0.1% SDS at 55°C) stringency (1 × SSC (saline sodium citrate) is 150 m NaCl, 15 m sodium citrate), and autoradiography was performed as described above. Expression constructs were created in the mammalian expression vector, pCIneo (Promega Corp.). Mouse Has2 ORFs were amplified by PCR, off a template of mouse Has cDNA clone λ11.1 (Fig. 1B). PCR primers were designed to create a mouse Has2 cDNA with an optimized Kozak consensus A–ATGG and to contain SmaI/XmaI sites at each end suitable for cloning. Primers were as follows: 5′-CCCGGGCAAG ATG GAT TGT GAG AGG TTT CTA TGT GTC CTG-3′ (bp 504 to 537, Fig. 2) and 5′-CCCGGG TCA TAC ATC AAG CAC CAT GTC ATA CTG-3′ (bp 2163 to 2137, Fig. 2). Gel-purified PCR products were cloned directly into a pBluescript KSII+ T-vector for sequence verification, prior to subcloning into the XmaI site of pCIneo. The mouse Has2 expression vector was co-transfected with a cytomegalovirus promoter (CMV)-driven β-gal expression vector into COS-1 (SV40-transformed African green monkey kidney) cells (21Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE™ (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The β-gal expression plasmid was used in all transfections to permit the visual identification of cells that had been successfully transfected. Control co-transfections were pCIneo (vector control) and LacZ vector. Cells were analyzed 36 h after lipofection (transient transfection). The COS-1 cell line and the mouse 3T6 (Swiss embryonic fibroblast) cell line (22Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar) were routinely maintained at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 m -glutamine, in a humidified chamber at 5% CO2. Glutaraldehyde fixed horse erythrocytes (Sigma) were reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed several times to remove traces of sodium azide, and finally resuspended in PBS plus 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to a density of 5 × 108 cells/ml. HA coats were visualized around live cells growing in individual wells of a 24-well plate or 6-well plate by adding 1 × 107 or 5 × 107 red blood cells, respectively, to the growth medium. Red cells were allowed to settle for 15 min before HA coats were scored. To confirm the coats as being composed of HA, red cells were removed by extensive washing with PBS, and one well of each experimental sample was treated with 10 units/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Calbiochem) or 5 units/ml Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Calbiochem) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C. Equivalent wells were incubated under the same conditions in the absence of hyaluronidase. After incubation, red cells were added to the wells, as described previously, and coats were again scored. HA coats were imaged at × 200 magnification. After imaging, red cells were removed by extensive washing with PBS. Cells were stained to detect β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity (23Sanes J.R. Rubenstein J.L. Nicolas J.F. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) and imaged as described. Utilizing degenerate RT-PCR, we successfully amplified partial cDNAs corresponding to a novel mouse gene, Has2 (HA synthase 2) (Fig. 1A), similar in sequence to X. laevis DG42 (24Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and S. pyogenes hasA (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse λ-cDNA library screening yielded multiple overlapping clones, which collectively spanned approximately 3 kb (Fig. 1B). Sequence analyses identified an open reading frame (ORF) of 1656 bp, flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of 507 and 772 bp, respectively (Fig. 2). The predicted translation initiation site conformed to the Kozak consensus for initiation (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Although there were four additional upstream ATGs within the 5′-UTR, none of these fitted the Kozak consensus and all were followed closely by in-frame stop codons. The presence of several upstream ATGs has, however, been more commonly described in oncogenic sequences (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4164) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR contained two consensus sequences for polyadenylation, a CA repeat and a TA repeat (Fig. 2). Data base searches indicated that the predicted amino acid sequence of mouse Has2 aligned most significantly with Xenopus DG42 (56% identity, 70% similarity) (24Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), streptococcal HasA (21% identity, 28% similarity) (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rhizobium sp. NodC (27Jacobs T.W. Egelhoff T.T. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 469-476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Collins-Emerson J.M. Terzaghi E.A. Scott D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and S. cerevisiae chitin synthase 2 (Chs2) (29Bulawa C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1764-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). A partial cDNA sequence that has been reported recently to encode a mouse chitin oligosaccharide synthase (30Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was identical to the central area of the mouse Has2 open reading frame. In addition, mouse Has2 displayed 55% identity and 73% similarity to a recently reported mouse HAS gene (17Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and the human homolog of this gene (31Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We have recently isolated clones for a second human Has gene, which shares greater than 95% amino acid identity to mouse Has2 and thus is predicted to represent the human HAS2 gene. 2A. P. Spicer and J. A. McDonald, manuscript in preparation. This suggests that there are at least two related Has genes in both mouse and humans. Investigation of the primary amino acid sequence of mouse Has2 identified several potential transmembrane sequences (Fig. 4), four potential HA binding motifs fitting the B(X7)B consensus (32Yang B. Yang B.J. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), and numerous consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) and cyclic AMP-dependent kinases, such as protein kinase A (PKA) (33Pearson R.B. Mitchelhill K.I. Kemp B.E. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Has2 was predicted to be a multiple membrane-spanning protein with a large cytoplasmic loop, similar to the predicted structure of Streptococcus HasA and mouse HAS (Has1) (Fig. 4). Sequence alignment with S. cerevisiae chitin synthase 2 (Chs2) demonstrated that the residues recently shown to be required for catalytic activity in this molecule (34Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T. Takagi M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13961-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) are conserved within the large predicted cytoplasmic loop of mouse Has2 (Fig. 3B). It has been suggested that these residues may be generally conserved within glycosyltransferases that catalyze the synthesis of oligosaccharides with β1→4 linkages (34Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T. Takagi M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13961-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Significantly, the predicted cytoplasmic loop of the Has2 molecule is the most highly conserved across species, and thus we predict this part of the protein to form the catalytic domain. Northern analyses detected two transcripts of approximately 3.2 kb and 4.8 kb, respectively (Fig. 5). The 4.8-kb transcript was expressed at levels approximately 20-fold higher than the 3.2-kb transcript. High levels of expression were observed in the developing mouse embryo, in addition to lower levels in adult mouse heart, brain, spleen, lung, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 5). All of the isolated cDNA clones were predicted to form an identical ORF. Thus, rather than being the result of alternate splicing, the 4.8-kb transcript most probably corresponds to a mouse Has2 mRNA with an alternate poly(A) signal, generating a 3′-UTR with approximately 1.8 kb of sequence, in addition to that reported herein. The pattern of hybridizing restriction fragments that was observed through Southern analyses was consistent with mouse Has2 being a single copy gene within the mouse genome (Fig. 6). In addition, the pattern observed in digests of total mouse genomic DNA was identical to that observed in equivalent digests of recently isolated mouse Has2 genomic clones.2 Low stringency wash conditions failed to identify any further hybridizing fragments including those fragments corresponding to the related mouse HAS (17Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) gene (data not shown). This suggests that the level of sequence identity (55%) between mouse Has2 and mouse HAS, and possibly other Has-related genes, is not sufficient to permit detection through Southern hybridization. Thus, while these results preclude the existence of a mouse Has2 pseudogene, they do not preclude the existence of other genes related to mouse Has2 and mouse HAS (Has1). To investigate the potential role of mouse Has2 in hyaluronan synthesis, expression vectors were created and transfected into COS-1 cells. Parental, untransfected COS-1 cells had no detectable coat-forming ability in HA pericellular coat-forming assays (Fig. 7B). In contrast, untransfected 3T6 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells had well-developed HA coats (Fig. 7A). Transient co-transfection of mouse Has2 and LacZ expression constructs enabled transfected COS-1 cells to produce large HA coats (Fig. 7, D-I). Cells acquiring an HA coat also stained positively for β-gal activity (Fig. 7, D-I). β-gal activity was utilized as a marker to confirm that cells that generated coats had successfully taken up DNA. HA coats were destroyed by treatment with Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 7H) or bovine testicular hyaluronidase. Control pCIneo transfected cells produced no coats (Fig. 7C) and were indistinguishable from parental untransfected COS-1 cells. Equivalent numbers of LacZ positive cells were observed in experimental and control transfections (data not shown). These results indicate that parental COS-1 cells express all other factors required for HA biosynthesis and pericellular coat formation, but presumably lack HA synthase activity. Expression of Has2 in COS-1 cells is sufficient for HA coat formation. Hyaluronan is a major constituent of the extracellular matrix of most tissues and organs, especially during embryonic development. Within the developing embryo, HA accumulates at sites of cell migration and proliferation and has been proposed to play important roles in craniofacial, limb, heart, and neural tube development (35Markwald R.R.

Over the last 10 years, HA has received considerable attention through the identification of specific cell surface receptors and binding proteins for HA (hyaladherins). These proteins appear to mediate the effects of HA upon cell behavior (reviewed in Refs. 45Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 46Knudson C.B. Knudson W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 47Sherman L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The study of HA itself, however, has not been easy as no eukaryotic genes that encode proteins involved in the HA biosynthetic pathway have been identified until recently (17Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In the bacterium, Streptococcus pyogenes, the ability to synthesize an HA capsule segregates as a virulence factor (10Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 433-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major advance in our understanding of HA biosynthesis has come through the characterization of the genes required for HA biosynthesis in S. pyogenes. Polymerization of HA occurs through the action of a single enzyme, HA synthase, encoded by the hasA gene (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is localized to the membrane and is predicted to have several transmembrane domains and a large intracellular loop encompassing the active site of the enzyme. Transfer of the hasA gene and a second gene, hasB, into heterologous bacterial species allows them to synthesize an HA capsule (11DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hasB gene encodes a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, which converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA), a subunit of HA. Furthermore, purified, immobilized HasA has been shown to be sufficient for HA polymerization in vitro (12DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A second protein, originally identified in Streptococcus equisimilis as the HA synthase (48Lansing M. Lellig S. Mausolf A. Martini I. Crescenzi F. O'Regan M. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), has no sequence similarity to S. pyogenes HasA. However, this protein has significant sequence similarity to bacterial proteins involved in oligopeptide binding and transport. Although the total amount of HA synthesized by bacterial cells overexpressing this protein increased, the length of the resultant HA chains was significantly shorter, suggesting that the increase may be a function of an elevation in the rate of HA transport from the cell (49O'Regan M. Martini I. Crescenzi F. De Luca C. Lansing M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, rather than being directly involved in HA biosynthesis, this protein may be involved in the transport of HA (49O'Regan M. Martini I. Crescenzi F. De Luca C. Lansing M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1994; 16: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against the S. equisimilis protein cross-reacted with a 52-kDa protein present in the membrane of mouse B6 cells (50Klewes L. Turley E.A. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 79"
https://openalex.org/W2036077355,"alpha-Latrotoxin, a black widow spider neurotoxin, can bind to high affinity receptors on the presynaptic plasma membrane and stimulate massive neurotransmitter release in the absence of Ca2+. Neurexins, previously isolated as alpha-latrotoxin receptors, require Ca2+ for their interaction with the toxin and, thus, may not participate in the Ca2+-independent alpha-latrotoxin activity. We now report the isolation of a novel protein that binds alpha-latrotoxin with high affinity in the presence of various divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+) as well as in EDTA. This protein, termed here latrophilin, has been purified from detergent-solubilized bovine brain membranes by affinity chromatography on immobilized alpha-latrotoxin and concentrated on a wheat germ agglutinin affinity column. The single polypeptide chain of latrophilin is N-glycosylated and has an apparent molecular weight of 120,000. Sucrose gradient centrifugations demonstrated that latrophilin and alpha-latrotoxin form a stable equimolar complex. In the presence of the toxin, anti-alpha-latrotoxin antibodies precipitated iodinated latrophilin, whose binding to immobilized toxin was characterized by a dissociation constant of 0.5-0.7 nM. This presumably membrane-bound protein is localized to and differentially distributed among neuronal tissues, with about four times more latrophilin expressed in the cerebral cortex than in the cerebellum; subcellular fractionation showed that the protein is highly enriched in synaptosomal plasma membranes. Our data suggest that latrophilin may represent the Ca2+-independent receptor and/or molecular target for alpha-latrotoxin."

The mutant APP is expressed at normal levels in brain, and cleavage at the mutant β-secretase site is both accurate and enhanced. Furthermore, human Aβ production is significantly increased to levels 9-fold greater than those in normal human brain while nonamyloidogenic processing is depressed. The results on Aβ production extend similar findings obtained in cell culture to the brain of an animal and substantiate Aβ as a etiological factor in Swedish familial AD. These animals provide several distinguishing features over others created by conventional transgenic methodologies. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of human Aβ are expected to be faithfully reproduced because the gene encoding the mutant APP remains in its normal chromosomal context.

https://openalex.org/W2003843472,"Thrombin binds to fibrin at two classes of non-substrate sites, one of high affinity and the other of low affinity. We investigated the location of these thrombin binding sites by assessing the binding of thrombin to fibrin lacking or containing γ′ chains, which are fibrinogen γ chain variants that contain a highly anionic carboxyl-terminal sequence. We found the high affinity thrombin binding site to be located exclusively in D domains on γ′ chains (Ka, 4.9 × 106−1; n, 1.05 per γ′ chain), whereas the low affinity thrombin binding site was in the fibrin E domain (Ka, 0.29 × 106−1; n, 1.69 per molecule). The amino-terminal β15-42 fibrin sequence is an important constituent of low affinity binding, since thrombin binding at this site is greatly diminished in fibrin molecules lacking this sequence. The tyrosine-sulfated, thrombin exosite-binding hirudin peptide, S-Hir53-64 (hirugen), inhibited both low and high affinity thrombin binding to fibrin (IC50 1.4 and 3.0 μ, respectively). The presence of the high affinity γ′ chain site on fibrinogen molecules did not inhibit fibrinogen conversion to fibrin as assessed by thrombin time measurements, and thrombin exosite binding to fibrin at either site did not inhibit its catalytic activity toward a small thrombin substrate, S-2238. We infer from these findings that there are two low affinity non-substrate thrombin binding sites, one in each half of the dimeric fibrin E domain, and that they may represent a residual aspect of thrombin binding and cleavage of its substrate fibrinogen.

It is commonly believed that non-substrate binding takes place at the same location as fibrinogen substrate binding, namely the central E domain. As determined from binding experiments with 125I-thrombin by Liu et al. (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two classes of non-substrate sites exist in fibrin, one of “high” affinity (Ka, ∼6 × 105−1) and the other of “low” affinity (Ka, ∼7 × 104−1). Hogg and Jackson (20Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol.

Human fibrinogen is chromatographically separable into two major components (“peak 1” and “peak 2”), which differ with respect to the structure of their γ chains (21Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5223-5227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimeric peak 1 fibrinogen molecules each contain two γA chains (γ1-411V), whereas peak 2 fibrinogen molecules, which amount to ∼15% of the total fibrinogen population (22Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and differ structurally in their COOH-terminal sequences in that γA chain residues 408-411 are replaced in γ′ chains by an anionic 20 amino acid sequence (24Mosesson M.W.

In this report we present compelling evidence that the anionic carboxyl-terminal γ′ chain sequence situated in the fibrin D domain constitutes the high affinity thrombin binding site, which is itself separate and distinct from the low affinity thrombin binding sites that reside in the central E domain. Human fibrinogen fraction I-2 was isolated from normal citrated plasma by glycine precipitation (37Mosesson M.W. Sherry S.

Elution of thrombin was achieved with HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing either 500 m NaCl or 40 m CaCl2. Factor XIII (1.95 units/μg) was prepared from pooled human plasma (43Lorand L. Gotoh T. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 19: 770-782Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and the activity assayed by the method of Loewy et al. (44Loewy A.G. Dunathan K. Kriel R. Wolfinger Jr., H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2625-2633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor XIII (500 units/ml) in 100 m NaCl, 50 m HEPES, pH 7.4, was activated to XIIIa in the presence of 500 μ dithiothreitol and 10 m CaCl2 by incubation with thrombin (10 units/ml, final) for 30 min at 37°C (45Kanaide H. Shainoff J.R. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1975; 85: 574-597PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin-fibrin binding experiments were performed using a modification of the method reported by Liu et al. (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrin monomer solutions were prepared from fibrinogen clotted at 1 mg/ml in 60 m NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 6.4, with thrombin (1 unit/ml, final) for 2 h at room temperature. The clots were synerized and dissolved in 20 m acetic acid to >10 mg/ml fibrin and repolymerized in a 10-fold excess of 100 m NaCl, 50 m Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 40 m CaCl2 and 2 m N-ethylmaleimide. These clots were synerized and dissolved in 20 m acetic acid to a 10 mg/ml stock solution. Clots containing 0.5 or 1 nmol of fibrin were formed by adding a fibrin monomer solution to a 100 m NaCl, 50 m HEPES, 0.01% (w/v) PEG 8000, pH 7.4, buffer containing varying amounts of 125I-labeled PPACK-thrombin and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Clot-bound thrombin was separated from free thrombin by syneresis of the clot. The final concentration of reactants in the clotting mixture were fibrin, 2.5 μ, 125I-PPACK-thrombin, 0-37.5 μ, in a final volume of 200 or 400 μl. For clotting mixtures containing des-Bβ1-42 fibrin, which polymerizes slowly and incompletely, full clot recovery (>95%) was assured by cross-linking the fibrin with factor XIIIa (25 units/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. After the incubation period, tubes were centrifuged and thrombin-bound clots separated from free thrombin by syneresis. The distribution of thrombin bound to the clot and free in solution was determined by radioactivity counting in a Packard Multi-prias 4 γ counter. The amount of thrombin trapped in the clot was estimated from the radioactive counts that were retained in cross-linked clots of peak 1 or des-Bβ1-42 peak 1 fibrin in the presence of 25 μ S-Hir53-64, which had been added to block thrombin exosite binding to fibrin. The binding data were graphed as Scatchard plots (46Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17730) Google Scholar). Data indicating a two-component system were deconvoluted by the method of Klotz and Hunston (47Klotz I.M. Hunston D.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3065-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). It was not technically feasible to reach thrombin concentrations which saturated the low affinity site in samples of peak 2 fibrin that contained high levels of the high affinity component. In these experiments, the low affinity component was defined by peak 1 (γA,γA) fibrin values and was used for correcting high affinity values (47Klotz I.M. Hunston D.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3065-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). High affinity thrombin binding to des Bβ1-42 peak 2 fibrin was not significantly affected by a low affinity binding component, and these data were therefore not corrected. The level of thrombin entrapment in the clots (≤4% of total counts) did not significantly effect binding parameters, and therefore no corrections were applied to the data. Competitive binding experiments involving thrombin anionic exosite binding were performed with the sulfated hirudin peptide, S-Hir 53-64, which was a generous gift from Dr. John Maraganore of Biogen Inc., Cambridge, MA. Hirugen at concentrations up to 40 μ was added to 125I-PPACK-thrombin (1 μ) and 0.5 nmol of fibrin at a final volume of 200 μl as described above for thrombin binding measurements. Peptide concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically at 215 nm using an absorbance coefficient of 15.0 ml mg−1 cm−1 (48Scopes R.K. Protein Purification. Springer-Verlag, New York1982: 241Google Scholar). A Fibrometer Precision Coagulation Timer (BBL Microbiology Systems) was used to determine the thrombin time for the conversion of fibrinogen (1 mg/ml final) to fibrin in 50 m Tris, 100 m NaCl, pH 7.4 at 37°C at a thrombin level of 0.6 unit/ml. Hydrolysis of S-2238 (H–phenylalanyl–pipecolyl–arginine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride; Chromogenix, Mölndal, Sweden) by thrombin (3.2 n) in 0.10 NaCl, 0.05 Tris, pH 7.5 buffer, was monitored at 405 nm at room temperature. Samples contained S-2238 (50 μ), with or without peak 1 fibrin (1 μ), or peak 2 fibrin (1 μ). The hydrolysis rate was estimated from the increase in absorbance at 405 nm during the first 3 min of the reaction. In our studies of thrombin binding to fibrin we found it useful as a general condition to covalently cross-link the fibrin polymer in the presence of factor XIIIa during the binding experiment in order to assure complete fibrin recovery (>95%). This procedure was particularly useful for recovering des Bβ1-42 fibrin clots, which polymerize slowly and incompletely in the absence of cross-linking (49Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio J.P. Budzynski A.Z. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There were no significant differences in thrombin binding behavior to cross-linked and non-cross-linked fibrin (Fig. 1), confirming the findings of Liu et al. (50Liu C.Y. Kaplan K.L. Markowitz A.H. Nossel H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7627-7630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin entrapment in the clot, as assessed in the presence of 25 μ S-Hir53-64, was ≤4% of the total counts and did not significantly change any of the calculated binding parameters. Our previous study with des-Bβ1-42 fibrin had indicated that the β15-42 sequence was a component of the non-substrate thrombin binding site in the fibrin E domain (49Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio J.P. Budzynski A.Z. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To extend those observations we carried out a systematic study of non-substrate thrombin binding to several fibrin preparations that differed with respect to their γ chain composition, their Bβ1-42 content, or both. Fraction I-2 fibrin, which has ∼15%γ′-containing molecules (22Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 62: 663-674PubMed Google Scholar), was studied first (Fig. 2). As assessed from the Scatchard plot, our results correspond to those reported by Liu et al. (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who studied a similar fibrinogen subfraction. The data indicate two classes of binding sites, one of high affinity (Ka, 5.5 × 106−1) and the other of low affinity (Ka, 0.45 × 106−1) (Table II). Studies of thrombin binding to peak 1 fibrin, which contains only γA chains, indicated a single class of binding site with a Ka of 0.21 × 106−1, corresponding to the low affinity site in fraction I-2 fibrin, and having a binding stoichiometry of 1.80 per molecule of fibrin (Fig. 2). Parallel analysis of thrombin binding to peak 2 fibrin demonstrated that high affinity binding dominated the Scatchard plot and that there were 0.83 high affinity sites per fibrin molecule (Fig. 3), a stoichiometry that corresponds well to the γ′ chain content in peak 2 fibrinogen preparations (48%γ′, 52%γA) (51Stathakis N.E. Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.K. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Low affinity binding in peak 2 fibrin was too low for accurate quantitation, but was in the same range as was found for peak 1 or fraction I-2 fibrin. There was a marked reduction of low affinity binding to des-Bβ1-42 peak 2 fibrin (Fig. 4), and therefore no corrections to the high affinity values were applied for the presence of a low affinity component. In the case of des-Bβ1-42 peak 1 fibrin, which lacks a high affinity binding site, reduced levels of low affinity thrombin binding were found (Fig. 4) and exceeded the amount that could be attributed to entrapment alone. The estimated Ka (0.11 × 106−1) was 38% of that found for peak 1 or fraction I-2 fibrin, but the stoichiometry was the same (i.e. 1.66 sites per molecule). To provide additional evidence that the γ′ sequence contains the high affinity site for thrombin exosite binding, we evaluated thrombin binding in the presence of S-Hir53-64, a well characterized thrombin exosite binding peptide, to des-Bβ1-42 peak 2 (high affinity) or peak 1 (low affinity) fibrin. S-Hir53-64 was an effective competitive inhibitor of thrombin binding to fibrin with an IC50 of 3.0 μ for high affinity thrombin binding and 1.4 μ for low affinity binding (Fig. 5), thus indicating that both classes of sites bind thrombin through its exosite. The mean thrombin times for peak 1 and peak 2 fibrinogens were 20.5 ± 0.5 and 20.4 ± 0.5 s (n = 5), respectively, indicating that the presence of the γ′ sequence had no measurable effect on thrombin substrate cleavage of fibrinogen. Hydrolysis of S-2238 was not inhibited by the presence of peak 1 fibrin or peak 2 fibrin in the hydrolysis mixture (Table III). These present experiments show that there is a unique high affinity non-substrate binding site for thrombin in the carboxyl-terminal region of the γ′ chain and a low affinity class of binding site in the amino-terminal region of fibrin, the latter contained in part within the Bβ1-42 sequence. In studies of fraction I-2 fibrinogen, which contains approximately 8%γ′ chains, we detected the same two classes of binding sites that were identified by Liu et al. (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinities we determined were about 10-fold higher for high affinity binding and 4-fold higher for low affinity binding (Table II). In peak 1 fibrin (γA,γA) only the low affinity binding component was observed, whereas with peak 2 fibrin (γ′,γA), there was increased high affinity thrombin binding corresponding to the increased content of γ′ chains. Overall, high affinity binding stoichiometry corresponds well to the content of γ′ chains, with one thrombin per γ′ chain. Although the existence and structure of the γ′ chain has been known for many years (21Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5223-5227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 51Stathakis N.E. Mosesson M.W. Galanakis D.K. Menache D. Thromb. Res. 1978; 13: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), its role as the high affinity non-substrate thrombin binding site in fibrin has been overlooked for several reasons. First, it has been generally assumed that the entire thrombin binding site in fibrin was a residual of the substrate recognition site in fibrinogen. Thus, knowledge that there were two classes of binding sites in fibrin, coupled with the observation that high affinity thrombin binding was only a minor component of the total binding reaction in fraction I-2 fibrin (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hogg P.J. Jackson C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), evidently did not raise suspicion of another possible thrombin-binding location. Second, most investigations on this subject have involved only central E domain structures (17Kaczmarek E. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13896-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vali Z. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 52Hogg D.H. Blombäck B.

Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or in addition, plasmic D fragments (17Kaczmarek E. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13896-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vali Z. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) from which the γ′ sequence had most likely been cleaved (54Haidaris P.J. Peerschke E.I.B. Marder V.J. Francis C.W. Blood. 1989; 74: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or which had a low content of γ′-containing molecules to begin with (i.e. fraction I-2) (19Liu C.Y. Nossel H.Y. Kaplan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10421-10425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 55Kaminski M. McDonagh J. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1990; 265: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could not have distinguished the specific location of any binding site. We would therefore revise the current belief that all non-substrate thrombin binding takes place in the fibrin E domain, to stipulate that only low affinity thrombin binding takes place in this region. We would concur, however, with the notion that thrombin binding in the E domain is likely to represent a residual aspect of the site that participated in fibrinogen substrate recognition. Scatchard analyses indicated a stoichiometry of 1.69 thrombin molecules per fibrin molecule, suggesting that there are two low affinity sites in each dimeric fibrin molecule, corresponding to a fibrinogen substrate recognition site for each pair of fibrinopeptides (FPA, FPB). Whether recognition site binding is the same for FPA and FPB cleavage has yet to be determined. Unlike the high affinity binding site in the γ′ chain, formation of the low affinity site in the E domain is not restricted to a single peptide sequence. Consistent with a previous report (49Siebenlist K.R. DiOrio J.P. Budzynski A.Z. Mosesson M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18650-18655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our current data suggest that the β15-42 sequence contributes significantly to non-substrate binding and that ∼60% of low affinity binding is lost by removal of this sequence. Other evidence suggests that the fibrin Aα27-50 sequence contributes as well to low affinity thrombin binding (18Vali Z. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 53Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 65: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The γ chains in the E domain have also been proposed as contributors to the thrombin binding site (17Kaczmarek E. McDonagh J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13896-13900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vali Z. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the evidence for this is not well substantiated. Fibrinogens New York I (des-Bβ9-72) and Naples I (Bβ A68 T) are dysfibrinogenemias, which have been characterized as having impaired thrombin binding (57Liu C.Y. Wallen P. Handley D.A. Lane D.A. Henschen A. Jasani M.K. Fibrinogen, Fibrin Formation and Fibrinolysis. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin Germany1986: 79Google Scholar, 58Koopman J. Haverkate F. Grimbergen J. Engesser L. Nováková I. Kerst A.F.J.A. Lord S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), presumably related to a defective amino-terminal substrate or non-substrate binding site. A recent study of recombinant γA-type Bβ A68 T fibrinogen has reaffirmed the importance of Bβ68 alanine in thrombin-mediated cleavage of Naples I fibrinogen (59Lord S.T. Strickland E. Jayjock E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2342-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the case of New York I, which is heterozygotic, thrombin binding to fibrin was 50% of normal, but there was no evidence to suggest a high affinity thrombin binding component (57Liu C.Y. Wallen P. Handley D.A. Lane D.A. Henschen A. Jasani M.K. Fibrinogen, Fibrin Formation and Fibrinolysis. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin Germany1986: 79Google Scholar). Similarly, thrombin binding to homozygous Naples I fibrin was reported to be absent (58Koopman J. Haverkate F. Grimbergen J. Engesser L. Nováková I. Kerst A.F.J.A. Lord S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and thus there was also no collateral evidence for high affinity thrombin binding to the presumably normal Naples I γ′ chain. However, in another report on this same family, thrombin binding to fibrin from a homozygous proband was reduced to only one-third of normal (60Di Minno G. Martinez J. Cirillo F. Cerbone A.M. Silver M.J. Colucci M. Margaglione M. Tauro R. Semeraro N. Quattrone A. Mancini M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 785-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The available data derived from studies on Naples I fibrin do not permit an unambiguous distinction to be made as to the presence or absence of a high affinity binding component, although we would have expected only low affinity binding to have been affected. Direct measurements of thrombin binding to substrate fibrinogen molecules have not been reported, owing to the fact that thrombin binding to its substrate is accompanied by concomitant conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Instead, estimation of substrate binding affinities have been made from kinetic experiments involving peptide A release from fibrinogen peptides or fibrinogen itself. The Km estimated from such studies is 6-11 μ (61Martinelli R.A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 62Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 976-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the Kd derived from similar kinetic studies was 1.3-2.6 μ (65Mathur A. Schlapkohl W.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7568-7573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 66Lord S.T. Rooney M.M. Hopfner K.-P. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24790-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the high affinity non-substrate site has a significantly higher affinity for thrombin exosite binding (Kd, 0.26 μ) than that estimated from the Km or the Kd derived for the substrate site (61Martinelli R.A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2343-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 62Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24790-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the γ′ site itself in fibrinogen is not an effective competitor for thrombin binding and cleavage at the fibrinogen substrate site, as assessed by our thrombin time measurements in this study and in another (22Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1963; 62: 663-674PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that the substrate binding site itself will prove to have a higher binding affinity for thrombin than has been estimated previously from Km measurements, by analogy with hirudin, which has a higher binding affinity for thrombin as a bivalent molecule than does its COOH-terminal exosite binding sequence alone. The physiological role that the γ′ sequence plays in modulating thrombin function still remains to be determined. It is very likely that the measurable thrombin clotting activity found in fibrin and fibrin degradation products (67Francis W.C. Markham E.R. Barlow H.G. Florack M.T. Dobrzynski M.D. Marder V.J. J.

Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is attributable to non-substrate binding at the γ′ site, or the low affinity site, or at both sites. In light of our present findings, it will be important to study the relationship between thrombin binding to γ′-containing fibrin and thrombin activation of coagulation factors such as factors V, VIII, or XIII or cellular receptors such as those on platelets and endothelial cells.

Somatostatin also stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in plasma membranes. Only those somatostatin analogs that shared a high affinity for sstr3 receptors elicited muscle contraction. IP3 formation, Ca2+ release, and contraction in permeabilized SMC and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in plasma membranes were inhibited (∼80%) by pretreatment with antibodies to PLC-β3 but not other PLC-β isozymes, and by antibodies to Gβ but not Gα. Inhibition of cAMP formation was partially blocked by antibody to Gαi1 or Gαo and additively blocked by a combination of both antibodies. Somatostatin-stimulated [35S]GTPγS-Gα complexes in plasma membranes were bound selectively by Gαi1 and Gαo antibodies.We conclude that in smooth muscle sstr3 is coupled to Gi1 and Go; the α subunits of both G proteins mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while the βγ subunits mediate activation of PLC-β3.

Somatostatin-14 bound with high affinity to intestinal SMC; stimulated -myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation, Ca2+ release, and contraction; and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in a pertussis toxin-sensitive fashion. Somatostatin also stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in plasma membranes. Only those somatostatin analogs that shared a high affinity for sstr3 receptors elicited muscle contraction. IP3 formation, Ca2+ release, and contraction in permeabilized SMC and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in plasma membranes were inhibited (∼80%) by pretreatment with antibodies to PLC-β3 but not other PLC-β isozymes, and by antibodies to Gβ but not Gα. Inhibition of cAMP formation was partially blocked by antibody to Gαi1 or Gαo and additively blocked by a combination of both antibodies. Somatostatin-stimulated [35S]GTPγS-Gα complexes in plasma membranes were bound selectively by Gαi1 and Gαo antibodies. We conclude that in smooth muscle sstr3 is coupled to Gi1 and Go; the α subunits of both G proteins mediate inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, while the βγ subunits mediate activation of PLC-β3."

To ascertain the potential role of Rad in insulin-mediated signaling, we have overexpressed Rad in myocyte and adipocyte cell lines. Expression of Rad resulted in a 50-90% reduction in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose glucose uptake in C2C12 murine myotubes, L6 rat myotubes, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes and a 25% reduction in 3-O-methylglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. This occurred despite unaltered levels of glucose transporter expression, with no detectable change in Glut4 translocation and with no alteration in insulin receptor or substrate phosphorylation or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. These data indicate that Rad is a negative regulator of glucose uptake and that this effect may be due to a decrease in the intrinsic activity of the transporter molecules, rather than an effect on the translocation of Glut4.

INTRODUCTIONMultidrug resistance has been defined as broad range resistance to chemotherapeutic agents associated with human tumors (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3549) Google Scholar). Although there are several different mechanisms that can contribute to multidrug resistance, one of the best understood involves overexpression of certain members of the ATP binding cassette transporter family of proteins: MDR1 (2Gros P.

Elevated levels of these transporter proteins lead to an enhanced rate of drug efflux from tumor cells with subsequent multidrug resistance (6Horio M. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The resulting cross-resistance to varied cytotoxic agents represents a major impediment to chemotherapy.Saccharomyces cerevisiae displays an analogous phenotype to mammalian multidrug resistance, termed pleiotropic drug resistance (Pdr). 1The abbreviations used are: Pdrpleiotropic drug resistancebpbase pairsPCRpolymerase chain reactionUASupstream activation sequence. The genes involved in the Pdr phenotype have thus far fallen into two general categories: membrane transporter proteins and their cognate transcriptional regulatory proteins (9Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). As in higher eukaryotes, several of these membrane transporter proteins are members of the ATP binding cassette transporter superfamily of proteins, including PDR5, SNQ2, and YOR1. PDR5 has been shown to play a role in resistance to a number of cytotoxic agents, including cycloheximide (10Bissinger P.H. Kuchler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Balzi E. Wang M. Leterme S. Van Dyck L. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Loss of function PDR5 mutants are sensitive to drugs due to an inability to efficiently efflux drugs, suggesting that PDR5 is directly involved in the efflux of these substances (13Leonard P.J. Rathod P.K. Golin J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2492-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Two homologous zinc finger transcription factors, encoded by PDR1 and PDR3, have previously been demonstrated to be key effectors of pleiotropic drug resistance, including cycloheximide tolerance (14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 15Delaveau T. Delahodde A. Carvajal E. Subik J. Jacq C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Epistasis analyses have demonstrated that cycloheximide resistance mediated by Pdr1p or Pdr3p requires the presence of PDR5 (14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Direct measurement of PDR5 gene expression indicates that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p can modulate transcription of PDR5. Deletion analysis of the PDR5 promoter indicates that the presence of a single DNA element, located at −187 in the 5′-noncoding region of the gene, is sufficient to maintain Pdr3p-responsive gene expression (14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).We have assessed the action of Pdr1p on the PDR5 promoter. PDR1 is the major contributor to drug resistance of the PDR1/PDR3 gene pair, presumably due to its importance as a transactivator (14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We show here that the same segment of the PDR5 promoter required for Pdr3p-responsive expression is also required for Pdr1p-responsive expression. Analysis of the PDR5 sequence has shown the presence of two other elements related by primary sequence to the Pdr1p/Pdr3p response element (PDRE) at −187. We have shown by DNase I footprinting analysis that both Pdr1p and Pdr3p are able to bind to these PDREs in vitro. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced mutations into the PDR5 PDREs that block the ability of both Pdr1p and Pdr3p to bind to these sequence elements. The various combinations of mutant PDREs were placed back in the context of a PDR5-lacZ fusion gene or the native PDR5 locus and analyzed in S. cerevisiae cells. These experiments revealed that all three sites are required for wild-type expression of PDR5, with each site contributing approximately equally. Furthermore, an oligonucleotide corresponding to one of these sites is capable of conferring Pdr1p responsiveness on a heterologous reporter system. From these experiments, we conclude that the PDRE is both necessary and sufficient to function as the in vivo site of action of Pdr1p and is likely to fulfill this role for Pdr3p as well.DISCUSSIONBoth PDR1 and PDR5 are major contributors to the ability of wild-type S. cerevisiae cells to tolerate a large variety of cytotoxic agents. Loss of function mutations in either of these loci elicit a severe drug hypersensitive phenotype of the resulting strains. Control of PDR5 expression is a key determinant in setting the level of drug tolerance of cells. In the current study, we have identified cis-acting elements that are required for wild-type PDR5 expression and drug resistance. These elements are bound in vitro by both Pdr1p and Pdr3p and have been designated PDREs. The PDREs in the PDR5 promoter show the typical sequence composition of recognition sequences for C6 zinc cluster proteins with sequence comparison suggesting that the consensus PDRE consists of TTCCGCGGAA. The same element has been found in other Pdr1p target genes, such as PDR3 (30Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), SNQ2 (28Decottignies A. Lambert L. Catty P. Degand H. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol.

Balzi, submitted for publication. and YOR1 (29Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the case of PDR3 (30Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and now PDR5 (this study), the PDREs have been shown to be required for Pdr1p transcriptional control of the gene in question. We conclude that the PDRE is the in vivo site of action for Pdr1p and likely for Pdr3p.Maintenance of wild-type PDR5 transcription requires the presence of either the PDR1 or PDR3 gene (14Katzmann D.J. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This finding indicated that PDR5 transcription was strictly PDR1/PDR3-dependent. We have extended this observation by producing a PDR5 promoter that is unable to be bound by bacterially produced Pdr1p or Pdr3p. This triple PDRE mutant promoter is not able to drive PDR5 expression as measured by either PDR5-dependent β-galactosidase activity or drug resistance. These data further support the view that the main, if not the only, source of activation of PDR5 transcription is supplied by the action of Pdr1p/Pdr3p at the PDREs. This is not true for all Pdr1p/Pdr3p regulated genes since both YOR1 (29Katzmann D.J. Hallstrom T.C. Voet M. Wysock W. Golin J. Volckaert G. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6875-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and SNQ2 (28Decottignies A. Lambert L. Catty P. Degand H. Epping E.A. Moye-Rowley W.S. Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18150-18157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) have significant Pdr1p/Pdr3p independent components of expression.This study of PDRE function in the PDR5 promoter also indicates that each of these regulatory elements appears to contribute roughly equally to overall PDR5 expression levels. As more PDREs are mutated, expression of the PDR5-lacZ gene is progressively diminished until all three sites are removed. The same trend is seen when the mutant PDR5 promoters are placed upstream of the PDR5 structural gene, with the possible exception of the site 2, 3 PDRE double mutant promoter. This mutant version of the PDR5 promoter was found to be reproducibly weaker, in terms of conferring cycloheximide tolerance, than the other two double PDRE mutant promoters, even though comparison of these three double mutant PDRE mutant promoters using the PDR5-lacZ fusion gene did not reveal any significant differences. One potential explanation for this observation is provided by the possible cycloheximide inducibility of PDR5 that has been described (12Hirata D. Yano K. Miyahara K. Miyakawa T. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 30Delahodde A. Delaveau T. Jacq C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4043-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since our β-galactosidase assays were performed on cells grown in the absence of cycloheximide, a defect in inducibility would not have been detected. We were unable to demonstrate induction of our wild-type PDR5-lacZ fusion by cycloheximide (data not shown), but this finding is complicated by the need for increased synthesis of β-galactosidase in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. Direct RNA measurements must be carried out to examine the possible role of cycloheximide inducibility in the function of the PDR5 promoter.Mutant forms of either PDR1 or PDR3 have been identified that lead to overproduction of PDR5 transcript (16Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Dexter D. Moye-Rowley W.S. Wu A.-L. Golin J. Genetics. 1994; 136: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for the alteration of function in these dominant, drug resistant mutant transcription factors is not yet well defined. In this study, we show that a single PDRE placed upstream of a CYC1-lacZ fusion gene confers Pdr1p responsive expression on this heterologous promoter and is strongly stimulated by the presence of the PDR1-6 dominant allele of PDR1. These data demonstrate two important facts about Pdr1p-responsive transcription. First, a single PDRE is sufficient to confer transcriptional regulation by Pdr1p. Secondly, the enhanced ability to stimulate transcription exhibited by the Pdr1p encoded by the PDR1-6 allele is promoter independent. The high degree of transactivation afforded by the PDR1-6 allele can be conferred on a heterologous promoter by placing 28 bp of PDR5 DNA upstream of this unrelated promoter. This observation is consistent with the belief that the Pdr1-6p is a stronger transactivator and that this enhanced transactivation does not require cooperation with other transcriptional regulators bound to nearby sites.

https://openalex.org/W2008929784,"The isoprostanes (IsoPs) are novel bioactive prostaglandin-like compounds produced in vivo by free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonyl-containing lipids. Previously, we have identified IsoPs containing F-type and D- and E-type prostane rings that are formed by reduction and rearrangement of IsoP endoperoxide intermediates, respectively. We now explore whether thromboxane B2 (TxB2)-like compounds, termed B2-isothromboxanes (B2-IsoTxs), are formed by rearrangement of IsoP endoperoxides. Detection of these compounds was carried out using a stable isotope dilution mass spectrometric assay originally developed for quantification of cyclooxygenase-derived TxB2. Incubations of arachidonic acid with Fe/ADP/ascorbate for 30 min in vitro generated a series of peaks representing putative B2-IsoTx at levels of 62.4 ± 21.0 ng/mg arachidonate. Using various chemical modification and derivatization approaches, it was determined that these compounds contained hemiacetal ring structures and two double bonds, as would be expected for B2-IsoTx. Analysis of the compounds by electron ionization mass spectrometry yielded multiple mass spectra similar to those of TxB2. B2-IsoTxs are also formed esterified to phospholipids; oxidation of arachidonyl-containing phosphatidylcholine in vitro followed by hydrolysis resulted in the release of large amounts of these compounds. To explore whether B2-IsoTxs are also formed in vivo, a well characterized animal model of lipid peroxidation consisting of orogastric administration of CCl4 to rats was used. Levels of B2-IsoTx esterified in lipids in the liver increased 41-fold from 2.5 ± 0.5 to 102 ± 30 ng/g of liver. In addition, circulating levels of free compounds increased from undetectable (<5 pg/ml) to 185 ± 30 pg/ml after CCl4, a 37-fold increase. Thus, we have provided evidence that IsoTxs constitute another novel class of eicosanoids produced in vivo nonenzymatically by free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. These studies thus expand our understanding of products of lipid peroxidation formed in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid.

Using various chemical modification and derivatization approaches, it was determined that these compounds contained hemiacetal ring structures and two double bonds, as would be expected for B2-IsoTx. Analysis of the compounds by electron ionization mass spectrometry yielded multiple mass spectra similar to those of TxB2. B2-IsoTxs are also formed esterified to phospholipids; oxidation of arachidonyl-containing phosphatidylcholine in vitro followed by hydrolysis resulted in the release of large amounts of these compounds. To explore whether B2-IsoTxs are also formed in vivo, a well characterized animal model of lipid peroxidation consisting of orogastric administration of CCl4 to rats was used. Levels of B2-IsoTx esterified in lipids in the liver increased 41-fold from 2.5 ± 0.5 to 102 ± 30 ng/g of liver. In addition, circulating levels of free compounds increased from undetectable (<5 pg/ml) to 185 ± 30 pg/ml after CCl4, a 37-fold increase. Thus, we have provided evidence that IsoTxs constitute another novel class of eicosanoids produced in vivo nonenzymatically by free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. These studies thus expand our understanding of products of lipid peroxidation formed in vivo from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of human disorders (1Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C.

Previously, we reported the discovery that a series of prostaglandin (PG) 1The abbreviations used are: PGprostaglandinIsoPisoprostaneIsoTxisothromboxaneF2-IsoPPGF2-like IsoPD2/E2-IsoPPGD2- and PGE2-like IsoPTxthromboxaneGCgas chromatographyNICInegative ion chemical ionizationMSmass spectrometryPFBpentafluorobenzylTMStrimethylsilylEIelectron ionization. F2-like compounds (F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs)) capable of exerting potent biological activity are produced in vivo in humans as products of the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid (5Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). Formation of these compounds occurs independently of the cyclooxygenase enzyme, which had heretofore been considered obligatory for endogenous prostanoid biosynthesis. Circulating levels of these compounds increase dramatically in animal models of free radical injury, and quantification of F2-IsoPs has proven to be an important advance in our ability to assess oxidant stress in vivo (5Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9383-9387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar, 6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Formation of F2-IsoPs proceeds through intermediates comprising four positional peroxyl radical isomers, which undergo endocyclization to yield PGG2-like bicycloendoperoxides. These are then reduced to F-ring IsoPs. F2-IsoPs are initially formed in situ from arachidonic acid esterified in phospholipids and are subsequently released preformed by a phospholipase (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A.

Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). This mechanism of formation is in contradistinction to the formation of cyclooxygenase-derived prostanoids in which arachidonic acid esterified in phospholipids must be released prior to oxygenation. prostaglandin isoprostane isothromboxane PGF2-like IsoP PGD2- and PGE2-like IsoP thromboxane gas chromatography negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry pentafluorobenzyl trimethylsilyl electron ionization. More recently, we reported that IsoPs that are PGD2- and PGE2-like compounds (D2/E2-IsoPs) also are produced in vivo from rearrangement of isoprostane endoperoxides (8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar). Like F-ring compounds, they are formed in situ on phospholipids, their formation increases markedly in animal models of oxidant injury, and they exert potent bioactivity. Because Tx can also be formed by nonenzymatic rearrangement of cyclooxygenase-derived PGH2 (9Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we explored whether Tx-like compounds can also be generated as rearrangement products of the IsoP endoperoxide intermediates. We present evidence that TxB2-like compounds are, in fact, produced both in vitro and in vivo and that they are present both esterified to phospholipids and in the free form. Because these compounds are isomeric to cyclooxygenase-derived TxB2, they henceforth will be referred to as B2-IsoTx. Methoxyamine HCl, FeCl3, ascorbate, ADP, pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) bromide, diisopropylethylamine, and Apis mellifera venom phospholipase A2 were obtained from Sigma. Dimethylformamide, undecane, and sodium borohydride were obtained from Aldrich. N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and N-trimethylsilylimidazole were obtained from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). [2H9]N,O-Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and [2H3]methoxyamine HCl were purchased from Regis Chemical Co. (Morton Grove, IL). All organic solvents were obtained from Baxter Healthcare (Burdick and Jackson Brand, McGraw Park, IL). C-18 and silica Sep-Paks were purchased from Waters Associates (Milford, MA). TLC was performed on Silica gel 60ALK6D plates (Whatman). [2H3]Thromboxane B2 and other deuterated prostaglandin standards were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Arachidonic acid and 1-palmitoyl,2-arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). IsoTxs were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC)/negative ion chemical ionization (NICI) mass spectrometry (MS) using a modification of methods described previously for the analysis of TxB2 (10Parsons W.G. Roberts L.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2413-2419PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 ng of [2H3]TxB2 internal standard was initially added to a biological fluid and adjusted to pH 3 with 1 HCl. The sample was applied to a C-18 Sep-Pak cartridge that had been prewashed with 5 ml of methanol and 5 ml of H20 (pH 3). The cartridge was then washed with 10 ml of H2O (pH 3) followed by 10 ml heptane, and compounds were eluted with 10 ml of ethyl acetate and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Compounds were subsequently methoximated by treatment with 250 μl of a 2% solution of aqueous methoxyamine HCl for 30 min at room temperature. Compounds were extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated under nitrogen. Compounds were then converted to a PFB ester by addition of 40 μl of a 10% solution of PFB bromide in acetonitrile and 20 μl of 10% diisopropylethylamine in acetonitrile and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Reagents were dried under nitrogen, and the residue was reconstituted in 30 μl of chloroform and 20 μl of methanol and chromatographed on a silica TLC plate to the top in a solvent system of ethyl acetate:methanol (98:2, v/v). The O-methyloxime and PFB ester derivative of TxB2 (approximately 5 μg), was chromatographed on a separate lane and visualized with 10% phosphomolybdic acid in ethanol by heating. The RF of the derivatized TxB2 standard in this solvent system was ∼0.46. Compounds migrating in the region 1.5 cm above and below the standard were scraped from the TLC plate, extracted with 1 ml of ethyl acetate, and dried under nitrogen. Following TLC purification, compounds were converted to trimethylsilyl (TMS) ether derivatives by addition of 20 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide and 10 μl of dimethylformamide. The sample was incubated at 37°C for 10 min and then dried under nitrogen. The residue was redissolved for GC/MS analysis in 10 μl of undecane, which had been stored over a bed of calcium hydride. GC/NICI MS was carried out on a Nermag R10-10C mass spectrometer interfaced with a Digital DEC-PDP computer. GC was performed using a 15-m, 0.25-μm film thickness, DB-1701 fused silica capillary column (J & W Scientific, Folsom CA). The column temperature was programmed from 190° to 300°C at 20°C/min. The major ion generated in the NICI mass spectrum of the PFB ester, O-methyloxime, and TMS ether derivative of TxB2, which would be the same ion generated by IsoTx, was the m/z 614 carboxylate anion M − 181 (M −ċCH2C6F5). The corresponding ion generated by the [2H3]TxB2 internal standard was m/z 617. Levels of endogenous B2-IsoTx in a biological sample were calculated from the ratio of the area under the m/z 614 chromatographic peaks to the m/z 617 chromatographic peak. In some experiments, compounds were reacted with trimethylsilyimidazole, subjected to catalytic hydrogenation, or reduced with sodium borohydride following TLC purification as described (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). IsoTxs were also analyzed by GC/electron ionization (EI) MS as methyl ester O-methyloxime and TMS ether derivatives. Purification and derivatization of compounds for analysis by GC/EI MS were as noted above, except the methyl ester derivatives were formed by treatment of compounds with excess ethereal diazomethane (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Purification, derivatization, and analysis of F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs by GC/NICI MS were performed as described (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar) Quantification of either F2-IsoPs or D2/E2-IsoPs in the present studies differed from previous reports in that the amounts of endogenous IsoPs were determined by comparing the ratios of the area under the chromatographic peaks representing endogenous material to that of the respective standard. 1-Palmitoyl-2-arachidonylphosphatidylcholine oxidized in vitro or lipids from livers of CCl4-treated rats were extracted as described (6Morrow J.D.

Methods Enzymol. 1969; 14: 245-248Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar) Depending on the experiment, 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene was added to the lipid extracts during the extraction procedure. The lipid extracts (containing approximately 1 μmol of phospholipid) were then hydrolyzed by chemical saponification or by reaction with A. mellifera venom phospholipase A2 (approximately 200 μg) as described (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R.

As a positive control for phospholipase A2 activity, phosphatidylcholine containing [3H]arachidonate in the sn-2 position was added to the incubation mixture, and the percent of radiolabeled arachidonate released was determined as described (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar). In all experiments, >95% of esterified [3H]arachidonate was released. Arachidonic acid and arachidonyl phosphatidylcholine were oxidized for 30 min using a Fe/ADP/ascorbate oxidizing system as described (12Longmire A.W. Swift L.L. Roberts L.J. Awad J.A. Burk R.F. Morrow J.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 47: 1173-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation was induced in rats by intragastric administration of CCl4 as described previously (13Burk R.F. Lane J.M. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1979; 50: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At various time intervals, animals were sacrificed, and the livers were removed, snap frozen in liquid N2, and either processed immediately or stored at −70°C. In some experiments, animals were pretreated with 5 mg/kg indomethacin at 24, 12, and 2 h prior to receiving CCl4. This has been previously shown to inhibit the cyclooxygenase >90% (14Jackson E.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 9-21PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we had shown that oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro results in the formation of large amounts of both F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar). Thus, we initially explored whether IsoTxs are also formed in vitro by analyzing arachidonic acid that had been oxidized with Fe/ADP/ascorbic acid. As described above, IsoTxs were detected using an assay originally developed for cyclooxygenase-derived TxB2. The selected ion current chromatograms obtained from this analysis monitoring m/z 614 for B2-IsoTx and m/z 617 for the [2H3]TxB2 internal standard are shown in Fig. 1. When analyzed in an analogous fashion, F2- or D2/E2-IsoPs are detected as a series of peaks eluting from the GC over approximately a 30-s interval. Similarly, in the upper m/z 614 chromatogram in Fig. 1, a series of peaks is present, which eluted from the GC column over an approximate 20-30-s interval. The peak in the lower m/z 617 chromatogram represents the coeluting syn- and anti-O-methyloxime isomers of the [2H3]TxB2 standard. Quantification of compounds in the m/z 614 chromatogram is based on a comparison of the ratios of the area under the sum of peaks in the m/z 614 chromatogram to the area under the peak representing the internal standard in the m/z 617 chromatogram. The amount of the compounds in the m/z 614 chromatogram was calculated to be 77.3 ng/mg arachidonic acid. Four other incubations of arachidonic acid were analyzed in a similar fashion, and for all five incubations, the mean value of presumed B2-IsoTx was 62.4 ± 21.0 ng/mg arachidonic acid. For comparison, in the same incubations, the yield of F2-IsoPs was 232 ± 64 ng/mg arachidonic acid, and the yield of D2/E2-IsoPs was 1269 ± 446 ng/mg arachidonic acid (n = 5). Nearly identical amounts of presumed B2-IsoTx (84 ± 31 ng/mg arachidonic acid, n = 5) were obtained when arachidonic acid esterified to phospatidylcholine was used as a substrate and B2-IsoTx was quantified after base hydrolysis or hydrolysis with bee venom phospholipase A2. The finding that large quantities of a series of compounds were formed during oxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro that had TLC and GC/MS properties similar to those of TxB2 would be consistent with their being B2-IsoTx. However, additional experimental approaches were used to obtain further evidence that the compounds detected in oxidized arachidonic acid were B2-IsoTxs. First, no peaks were present when m/z 613 was monitored, indicating that the m/z 614 peaks were not natural isotope peaks of compounds generating an ion of less than 614 Da. When the compounds were analyzed as [2H9]TMS ether derivatives, the m/z 614 peaks all shifted upward 27 Da, indicating that the compounds have three hydroxyl groups. When the compounds were analyzed as [2H3]O-methyloxime derivatives, the m/z 614 peaks all shifted upward 3 Da, indicating that they contain one carbonyl group. When the compounds were analyzed following catalytic hydrogenation, there was a disappearance of the m/z 614 peaks and the appearance of new intense peaks 4 Da higher at m/z 618 (Fig. 2). No peaks were detected at m/z 616 or 620. This indicated that all of the compounds contained two double bonds. Collectively, these results indicated that the compounds represented by the m/z 614 peaks contain the same functional groups and the number of double bonds expected for the PFB ester, O-methyloxime, and TMS ester derivative of B2-IsoTx. A unique feature of TxB2 is that it contains a hemiacetal ring, which exists in aqueous solution in an equilibrium between open and closed forms. Thus, powerful evidence that the compounds detected were B2-IsoTxs would be to demonstrate that these compounds contain a hemiacetal ring. Such evidence can be obtained using different derivatization and chemical modification approaches (15Roberts II, L.J. Sweetman B.J. Oates J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8384-8393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, if putative B2-IsoTxs are first reacted with methoxyamine, derivatives will be formed in which the hemiacetal ring is open. Subsequent conversion to PFB ester and TMS ether derivatives would be expected to result in a series of compounds with a major fragment ion of 614 Da (M − 181 and M −ċCH2C6F5) when analyzed by GC/NICI MS. The selected ion monitoring analysis of presumed IsoTx derivatized in this manner has been previously discussed and is shown in Fig. 1. If, on the other hand, as shown in Fig. 3B, the treatment with methoxyamine is omitted, and the compounds are converted to PFB ester and TMS ether derivatives, the hemiacetal ring will remain closed. Derivatives of these compounds would be expected to generate major fragment ions of 585 Da (M − 181) when analyzed by NICI MS. Results using this derivatization approach are shown in Fig. 4A. As is evident, in the upper m/z 585 chromatogram, a series of chromatographic peaks are present that elute at a similar retention time to the [2H3]TxB2 internal standard represented in the lower m/z 588 chromatogram. Finally, as shown in Fig. 4C, if the carbonyl at C-11 in the open ring form is first reduced with NaBH4 followed by conversion to PFB ester and TMS ether derivatives, the major M − 181 fragment ion would be generated at 659 Da. Results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4B. Again, a series of m/z 659 peaks elute from the GC at a retention time similar to this derivative of the TxB2 internal standard. Collectively, the results of these studies provide additional significant evidence that these compounds contain a hemiacetal ring as does TxB2.Fig. 4GC/NICI MS analysis of putative B2-IsoTx from arachidonic acid oxidized in vitro. A, analysis of compounds as PFB ester and TMS ether derivatives. In the lower m/z 588 chromatogram is the derivatized [2H3]TxB2 internal standard.

B, analysis of compounds after reduction with NaBH4 followed by conversion to PFB ester and TMS ether derivatives. The peak representing this derivative of the [2H3]TxB2 internal standard is shown in the lower m/z 662 chromatogram. The series of peaks in the upper m/z 659 chromatogram represents presumed B2-IsoTx compounds. The pattern of peaks in Fig. 1, A and B, likely differs due to different GC characteristics of the various derivatives.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To obtain more direct evidence that the compounds detected by NICI MS were B2-IsoTx, the compounds were analyzed as methyl ester, O-methyloxime, and TMS ether derivatives by EI MS. The results of this analysis yielded a series of compounds eluting over approximately a 20-s period from the capillary GC column, which yielded mass spectra with characteristics of the EI mass spectrum of TxB2. One of the mass spectra obtained from a major peak is shown in Fig. 5. Other mass spectra obtained from the analysis of the other peaks were similar to that shown in Fig. 5, except that either the relative abundance of some of the fragment ions varied or some of the lower molecular weight fragment ions were different. In the mass spectrum shown, there is a prominent ion at m/z 629, representing the molecular ion. Other characteristic ions present are m/z 614 (M − 15, loss of ċCH3), m/z 598 (M − 31, loss of ċOCH3), m/z 539 (M − 90, loss of (Me3)3SiOH), m/z 524 (loss of 90 + 15), m/z 508 (loss of 90 + 31), m/z 418 (loss of 2 × 90 + 31), m/z 398 (loss of ċCH2CH=CH(CH2)3COOCH3+ 90), m/z 392 (M − 57 − (2 × 90), loss of ċCH2(CH2)2CH3+ (2 × 90)), m/z 369 [M − 173 − 87, loss of ċCH2(OSi(Me3)3(CH2)4CH3) +ċCH2CH2COOCH3), m/z 243, ((Me3)3SiO+=CHCH2CH=CH(CH3)3COOCH3) and m/z 174 ((Me3)3SiO+=CHCH2CH=NOCH3). Of particular interest is the major fragment ion of 243 Da. This ion is not present in the mass spectrum of this derivative of cyclooxygenase-derived TxB2. However, this is an expected ion resulting from α cleavage of the trimethoxysiloxy substitutent at C-8, as depicted in the regioisomer shown in Fig. 5 (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 16Waugh R.J. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 1: 490-499Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, this EI mass spectral data provide additional confirmatory evidence for the formation of IsoTxs by nonenzymatic peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Since the above results suggested that IsoTxs could be formed in vitro, we investigated whether these compounds may also be formed in vivo. Previously, we had shown that F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs are initially formed in situ from arachidonic acid esterified in tissue phospholipids and subsequently released preformed (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether IsoTxs are also formed esterified in phospholipids in livers of rats that had been treated with CCl4 to induce lipid peroxidation. To investigate this, lipids were extracted from the livers, subjected to hydrolysis using methanolic potassium hydroxide, and analyzed as free compounds. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 6. A series of m/z 614 peaks was present in a pattern very similar to that obtained from analysis of arachidonic acid oxidized in vitro, although the relative abundances of the various peaks differ slightly (cf. Fig. 1). Essentially identical results were obtained when phospholipids were hydrolyzed enzymatically with phospholipase A2 from A. mellifera (data not shown). Table I compares the amounts of the B2-IsoTxs with D2/E2-IsoPs and F2-IsoPs measured following hydrolysis of lipids from the same livers of both untreated and CCl4-treated rats. The quantities of B2-IsoTx measured following hydrolysis of lipids from livers of CCl4-treated rats were 41-fold higher than those in untreated rats. Levels of free B2-IsoTx measured in lipid extracts that were not subjected to hydrolysis were <1% of the levels measured following hydrolysis (n = 4), suggesting that the compounds detected following saponification were released from an acyl linkage on phospholipids. Pretreatment of animals with indomethacin prior to CCl4 administration with a dosage regimen previously shown to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity by >90% (14Jackson E.K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1989; 250: 9-21PubMed Google Scholar) did not affect levels of the compounds measured (p > 0.7, Student's t test; n = 4), indicating that the cyclooxygenase enzyme is not involved in their formation. Previously we had shown that butylated hydroxytoluene markedly suppresses the formation of F2-IsoPs by autoxidation in vitro (7Morrow J.D. Harris T.M. Roberts L.J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 184: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The presence of butylated hydroxytoluene (0.005%) in the extraction solution, however, did not affect levels of IsoTx measured (p > 0.6; n = 4), arguing that these compounds are not formed ex vivo by autoxidation during sample processing.Table IComparison of levels of B2-IsoTx and IsoP in hydrolyzed lipid extracts from liver tissue of rats with and without CCl4 treatment (n = 5 animals/group)RatsB2-IsoTxsD2/E2-IsoPsF2-IsoPsng/g liverUntreated2.5 ± 0.51.9 ± 0.34.6 ± 0.7CCl4 treated102 ± 30161 ± 37672 ± 179 Open table in a new tab Experiments were then carried out to obtain further evidence of the identity of the compounds represented by the m/z 614 peaks in Fig. 6 as B2-IsoTx. First, analysis of compounds obtained from the hydrolysis of liver extracts as a [2H9]TMS ether derivative resulted in a shift of each of the m/z 614 peaks upwards of 27 Da, indicating the presence of three hydroxyl groups. Analysis as [2H3]O-methyloxime derivatives resulted in a shift of the m/z 614 peaks upwards of 3 Da, indicating the presence of one carbonyl group. When the compounds were analyzed following catalytic hydrogenation, there was a disappearance of the m/z 614 peaks and the appearance of new intense peaks 4 Da higher at m/z 618. No peaks were detected at m/z 616 or 620. This indicated that all of the compounds contained two double bonds. Furthermore, analysis of the compounds using the different derivatization approaches and chemical modification as outlined in Fig. 3 indicated the presence of a hemiacetal ring, as was found in the compounds generated in vitro (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results indicated that the compounds generated in vivo represented by the m/z 614 peaks contain a hemiacetal ring and the same functional groups and number of double bonds as would be expected for B2-IsoTx. We have previously demonstrated that F2-and D2/E2-IsoPs are initially formed esterified to tissue phospholipids in CCl4-treated rats and subsequently released into the circulation preformed (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R.

Burk R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2502-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether increased concentrations of these IsoTxs could also be detected free in the circulation of rats 4 h following administration of CCl4 to induce lipid peroxidation. In these studies, animals were pretreated with indomethacin to inhibit cyclooxygenase-derived TxB2 from blood elements. IsoTxs could not be detected in plasma from normal rats that had not been treated with CCl4 (lower limit of detection, 5 pg/ml; n = 4). However, following treatment of rats with CCl4, B2-IsoTx were detected in plasma at concentrations of 185 ± 30 pg/ml (n = 4), representing an increase of 37-fold. The pattern of peaks was essentially identical to that shown in Fig. 6. We have previously shown that increases in levels of F2-IsoPs esterified to circulating lipids parallel increases in free levels after administration of CCl4 (17Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Kato T. Takahashi K. Badr K.F. Roberts II, L.J. Burk R.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2502-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also quantified levels of B2-IsoTxs esterified in circulating plasma lipids and found that CCl4 administration increased levels from 13 ± 12 to 237 ± 63 pg/ml (n = 4). In summary, these studies support the concept that B2-IsoTxs are formed in situ on phospholipids and subsequently released preformed into the circulation. These studies report the discovery that thromboxane-like compounds, termed IsoTxs, are formed both in vitro and in vivo by nonenzymatic free radical-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. Analogous to the formation of F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs, B2-IsoTxs are also formed in situ esterified to phospholipids and released in the free form, presumably by a phospholipase. A pathway for the formation of these compounds is outlined in Fig. 7. It is identical to that outlined previously for the formation of F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs involving the formation of the bicyclic endoperoxide intermediates (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 8Morrow J.D. Minton T.A. Mukundan C.R. Campbell M.D. Zackert W.E. Daniel V.C. Badr K.F. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4317-4326Google Scholar). In the formation of IsoTx, however, the endoperoxides undergo rearrangement to form TxA2-like compounds, termed A2-IsoTxs, which then rapidly decompose to more stable TxB2-like molecules, termed B2-IsoTxs. Analogous to the formation of F2-IsoPs, four regioisomers of B2-IsoTxs are formed, each of which can theoretically comprise eight racemic pairs of diastereomers. Although B2-IsoTx can be generated both in vitro and in vivo from arachidonic acid, the chemistry involved in the conversion of isoprostane endoperoxides to IsoTx is not entirely clear. It may, however, be similar to that proposed for the conversion of the cyclooxygenase-derived endoperoxide PGH2 to TxA2 by the enzyme thromboxane synthase (9Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thromboxane synthase is a cytochrome P450 enzyme containing a catalytic iron moeity at its active site. Hecker and Ullrich (9Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have proposed that the formation of TxA2 initially involves complexing of the Fe3+ in the enzyme active site with the oxygen at C-9 on the endoperoxide PGH2. This is followed by homolytic scission of the endoperoxide bond, leading to formation of an alkoxyl radical. Subsequently, β scission of the C-11—C-12 bond occurs, followed by rearrangement of the molecule to form TxA2, which then rapidly decomposes to TxB2. A similar mechanism might also explain the nonenzymatic formation of B2-IsoTx from the iron-catalyzed peroxidation of arachidonic acid in vitro. Arguing against this mechanism, however, is the observation by Hecker and Ullrich (9Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that reaction of inorganic Fe+3 with PGH2 does not result in the formation of significant quantities of TxB2. In those studies, however, Hecker and Ullrich (9Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did find that large amounts of TxB2 were generated from PGH2 if iron was present complexed in a porphyrin such as hemin. Thus, it is possible that the formation of IsoTx in vivo might be catalyzed by porphyrin-containing compounds or Fe-containing enzymes, including Tx synthase. On the other hand, the fact that large amounts of B2-IsoTx can be formed in vitro when arachidonic acid is oxidized with Fe/ADP/ascorbate would suggest that complexed iron or Fe-containing enzymes are not necessary for the formation of IsoTx. It should be noted that the quantities of B2-IsoTxs that are formed in vivo are only slightly less than the amounts of D2/E2-IsoPs generated. Since the levels of many of the individual IsoPs in normal human biological fluids are at least an order of magnitude higher than cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins, the amounts of IsoTx that are produced in vivo are not trivial. We have previously reported that both F- and D/E-ring IsoPs possess potent biological activities (5Morrow J.D. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. Nammour T.M. Badr K.F. Roberts L.J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whether IsoTx possess biological activity will be difficult to ascertain. It is reasonable to assume that if IsoTx possess bioactivity, such activity would reside with the TxA-ring compounds rather than the TxB-ring compounds, analagous to cyclooxygenase-derived Txs, of which TxA2 is bioactive but TxB2 is devoid of biological activity. However, because the TxA-ring is extremely unstable, undergoing rapid hydrolysis to form the TxB-ring, isolation of A2-IsoTx for biological testing would be difficult, if not impossible. It should also be mentioned that there are potentially important biological ramifications associated with the formation of IsoTx esterified in phospholipids. We previously reported that molecular modeling of phospholipids with F2-IsoPs esterified at the sn-2 position revealed them to be extremely distorted molecules (6Morrow J.D. Awad J.A. Boss H.J. Blair I.A. Roberts II, L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10721-10725Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thus, the formation of isoprostane-containing phospholipids in settings of oxidant stress may have deleterious effects on membrane fluidity and integrity, well recognized sequelae of oxidant injury (21Sevanian A. Kim E. J. Free Radicals Biol. & Med. 1985; 1: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Since we have now discovered that, in addition to F2-IP and D2/E2-IsoPs, IsoTxs are also formed esterified to phospholipids in large quantities, the total quantities of phospholipids containing products of the isoprostane pathway that may be formed in settings of free radical injury are substantially greater than previously thought. In summary, we report the discovery that IsoTxs are formed in vivo as products of nonenzymatic free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. Analogous to the formation of F2-IsoPs and D2/E2-IsoPs, IsoTxs are formed in situ esterified to phospholipids and subsequently released in free form. Further understanding the biological consequences of the formation of these novel compounds and mechanisms by which they are formed may provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of oxidant injury."

We have investigated the physiological consequences of constitutive expression of a recombinant form of calcineurin in which the Ca2+/calmodulin-binding and autoinhibitory domains of the catalytic subunit were deleted. The concomitant expression of the regulatory subunit along with the truncated catalytic subunit resulted in high tolerance to toxic levels of Na+ and Li+. This activated form of calcineurin substituted for the Na+ stress signal to promote the expression of the ENA1 gene, encoding a P-ATPase pump, and to induce the transition of the K+ uptake system to the high affinity mode that restricts influx of Na+ and Li+. In addition, the transcriptional responsiveness of ENA1 to Na+ stress was enhanced. These results demonstrate that calcineurin has a pivotal role in a signaling cascade activated by ion stress in yeast.

INTRODUCTIONCalcineurin (CaN) 6The abbreviations used are: CaNcalcineurinCNAcatalytic subunit ACNBregulatory subunit BPCRpolymerase chain reactionMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase consisting of a catalytic subunit (CNA) and a regulatory subunit (CNB). CNA is inactive in the absence of the Ca2+-binding CNB subunit and the heterodimer CNA/CNB is activated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (CAM) binding (1Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of CaN activity by Ca2+ is dual because Ca2+/CAM binding increases the Vmax and Ca2+/CNB increases the affinity of CaN for its substrate (2Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At least four functional domains have been identified in the CNA subunit. The amino-terminal catalytic core, which has extensive similarity to type 2A protein phosphatases, is followed by a CNB-binding domain, a CAM-binding site, and an autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 1) (4Kincaid R. Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Advances in Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Research. Vol 27. Raven Press Ltd., New York1993: 1Google Scholar). The autoinhibitory domain likely functions as a competitive inhibitor that binds at or near the active site of the enzyme (5Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+/CAM to CNA apparently activates CaN by displacing the autoinhibitory domain. Proteolytic removal of the calmodulin-binding and autoinhibitory domains of CaN yielded a core CNA/CNB heterodimer that was active in vitro in the absence of Ca2+/CAM, yet retained some responsiveness to free Ca2+, presumably through the Ca2+-binding CNB subunit (2Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Transfection of Jurkat T-cells with a recombinant CNA subunit lacking the CAM-binding and autoinhibitory domains induced Ca2+-independent activation of the interleukin-2 promoter, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal truncation was sufficient to activate CaN in vivo (5Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although an increasing number of CaN-dependent cellular processes are being identified in different eukaryotic systems, regulation of ion fluxes is clearly a principal function of CaN. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CaN is essential for tolerance to Na+, Li+, and Mn2+ (7Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and participates in the regulation of the K+ uptake system (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, simultaneous inactivation of CaN and the vacuolar H+-ATPase are synthetically lethal, and regulation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase by CaN has been suggested (12Garrett-Engele P. Moilanen B. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4103-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Hemenway C.S. Dolinski K. Cardenas M.E. Hiller M.A. Jones E.W. Heitman J. Genetics. 1995; 141: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The monovalent cations K+ and Na+ share a common uptake system in S. cerevisiae. When challenged with growth inhibitory concentrations of Na+, yeast cells alter the kinetic properties of the K+ transport system increasing its affinity for K+ to restrict the influx of Na+ (14Haro R. Bañuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This response is dependent on a functional TRK1 gene, that encodes a putative K+ transporter involved in high affinity K+ uptake (15Ramos J. Contreras P. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 88-93Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, Na+ induces the expression of ENA1, a gene encoding a P-type ATPase that mediates Na+ efflux, to restore low cytosolic Na+ levels (17Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We have shown that S. cerevisiae cells deficient in CaN activity become hypersensitive to Na+ and Li+ (an analog of Na+) because of an insufficient induction of ENA1 that results in low net ion efflux (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, although CaN mutants display a normal transition to the high affinity mode of K+ transport induced by K+ starvation, these cells fail to enter the high affinity mode in response to Na+ stress. These results imply that there are two signaling pathways controlling appropriate K+ homeostasis in S. cerevisiae. One of these signaling cascades responds to K+ starvation by an, as yet unknown, CaN-independent mechanism. The other signaling pathway is CaN-dependent and coordinates gene expression and activity of monovalent cation transporters in response to Na+ stress (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).CaN has also been implicated to function in the acquisition of cell polarity in eukaryotes. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a null CaN mutant lost cell polarity and produced branched cell divisions. Overexpression of CaN caused abnormal cell and nuclear shapes and spindle pole body positioning (18Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the initial outgrowth of neurites, CaN was localized to the tips of growth cones associated with the neuronal cytoskeleton, and CaN inhibitors prevented axonal elongation (19Ferreira A. Kincaid R. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1225-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A strikingly similar spatial distribution has been described for CAM in S. cerevisiae. In unbudded cells, CAM concentrated at the site of bud formation before bud emergence, then concentrated at the tip of the growing bud, and finally localized to the neck region before cytokinesis (20Brockerhoff S.E. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 29-619Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CAM-regulated proteins may participate in polarized cell growth. No data on the localization of CaN in yeast cells are yet available.Here we show that constitutive activation of CaN results in an increased tolerance to toxic levels of Na+ and Li+. The activation of CaN can both substitute for and enhance Na+ stress signaling that mediates ion tolerance. Moreover, increased CaN activity elicits a developmental switch in the budding pattern of the yeast S. cerevisiae, whereas CaN depletion may interfere with acquisition of cell polarity.DISCUSSIONWork on Jurkat T-cells showed that cells transfected with a truncated CNA subunit lacking the CAM-binding and autoinhibitory domains did not require a Ca2+ signal to activate the transcription of the interleukin-2 gene (5Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that truncation of the catalytic subunit results in constitutive CaN activity in vivo. However, expression of a similarly truncated CNAtr1 subunit in yeast cells had no significant effect on Li+ tolerance or cell morphology, unless accompanied by the co-expression of the regulatory B subunit. These results, together with the inability of CNAtr1 to complement a cnb1 mutant, demonstrate that the binding of the regulatory subunit is essential for the activity of the truncated catalytic subunit in vivo. The difference between the mammalian and the yeast system may arise from the availability of endogenous regulatory subunits for binding and activation of the ectopically expressed catalytic subunit. Thus, CNBp might be limiting in yeast cells, whereas there is evidence that the endogenous B subunit is in excess of the catalytic A subunit in Jurkat cells (35Milan D. Griffitth J. Su M. Price E.R. McKeon F. Cell. 1994; 79: 437-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Remarkably, co-expression of a full-length CNA2p along with the regulatory CNBp subunit had little effect on the Li+ tolerance, growth rate, or morphology of yeast cells, suggesting that other factor(s) might be limiting the activity of wild-type CaN. Obviously, one such factor might be calmodulin which is no longer required for the activity of the CNAtr1/CNB complex. However, the failure of native CaN to induce tolerance is not likely the result of insufficient CAM since CaN is one of the proteins with highest affinity for CAM and CAM is most probably in excess of CaN in yeast. Cunningham and Fink (10Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) have shown that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ in pmc1 and pmr1 mutants lacking Ca2+-ATPases inhibits yeast growth and distorts cell shape through permanent activation of CaN. Here, we have shown abnormal cell morphology through the concurrent overexpression of CNAtr1 and CNB subunits in cells with otherwise normal Ca2+ homeostasis. The finding that similar consequences can be attained either by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in cells with wild-type CaN, or by the expression of a recombinant CNAtr1/CNB calcineurin, suggests that the truncation of CaN sets a lower threshold for the Ca2+-dependent activation of CaN. This conclusion is consistent with the recent demonstration that deletion of the regulatory region of the A subunit reduced the Ca2+-dependence of CaN (3Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Presumably, this lowered Ca2+ dependence arises because the B subunit of proteolytically truncated CaN (analogous to the recombinant CNAtr1/CNB) has a higher affinity for Ca2+ than the native enzyme, allowing activation at Ca2+ levels (0.3 μ) below those found in stimulated cells (0.5-1 μ) (2Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been recently proposed that CaN represses Ca2+ sequestration into an intracellular compartment, presumably to amplify Ca2+ signaling (11Tanida I. Hasegawa A. Iida H. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of a truncated CaN with a reduced Ca2+ requirement for activity might further increase the cytosolic concentration of free Ca2+, thereby exacerbating the activation of CaN and other Ca2+-dependent signaling proteins.We have previously demonstrated that CaN activity allowed homeostasis of Na+ and Li+ through the coordinate regulation of the efflux and influx transporters of these monovalent cations (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tanida et al. (11Tanida I. Hasegawa A. Iida H. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have proposed that CaN could amplify the Ca2+ signals in yeast cells by repressing the sequestration of Ca2+ within an as yet unidentified internal store. A Ca2+ spike in response to NaCl stress has been described in plant cells but not yet in yeast (36Lynch J. Polito V.S. Lauchli A. Plant. Physiol. 1989; 90: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since the Ca2+-dependent activity of CaN is required for tolerance to NaCl, a similar Ca2+ signaling can be implied in yeast. Thus, CaN might be required only to modulate the intensity of the Ca2+ signaling activated by Na+ stress. However, it is unlikely that an increased level of cytosolic Ca2+ per se would suffice to trigger specifically the Na+ stress response in the absence of the inducer (i.e. Na+). Our data support a more pivotal role of CaN in the cellular response of Na+ stress. First, we have shown that constitutive activation of CaN not only enhances the expression of ENA1 after induction by NaCl but also allows the expression of ENA1 in the absence of inducer (Fig. 2). Second, CaN activity is essential for the transition of the K+ uptake system to the high affinity mode of K+ transport under Na+ stress (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we show now that the activation of CaN was able by itself, without induction by Na+ stress, to switch the K+ transport system to a state with higher discrimination of K+ over Li+ (and Na+) (Fig. 4). Such coordinated and Na+ stress-specific response of two different ion transporters probably requires the integration of different input signals for the activation of specific pathway(s). Since the activation of CaN alone can substitute for such integration, CaN is probably an integral component of the pathway(s) that regulates ion homeostasis in yeast. In other words, activation of CaN is both a necessary and sufficient signal for the cellular response to Na+ stress.An elongated cell shape was found concurrent with a switch to a polar budding pattern in cells expressing the recombinant CNAtr1/CNB calcineurin. Often, elongated cells remained attached after polar budding, thereby producing chains of elongated cells that resembled pseudohyphae. The overexpression or constitutive activation of protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) or PAM1, a protein of unknown function that suppresses the growth of PP2A-deficient cells, produced chains of elongated cells very similar to those shown in Fig. 5 (37Healy A.M.

Interestingly, PP2A modulates morphogenesis during pseudophyphal differentiation in response to nitrogen starvation in S. cerevisiae (33Blacketer M.J. Koehler C.M. Coats S.G. Myers A.M. Madaule P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5567-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, we failed to find synergism between CaN activation and nitrogen starvation in promoting a full dimorphic transition to pseudohyphal growth, or between the overexpression of truncated CaN and PP2A or PAM1. 2F. J. Quintero and J. M. Pardo, unpublished observations. Further, the timing of nuclear division and the length of G1 and G2 phases did not match those of pseudohyphae. However, the set of distinctive phenotypic characteristics of pseudohyphae are likely to be controlled independently. For instance, haploid elm mutants showed delayed cell separation and the ability to forage within the agar but not the unipolar budding pattern; instead, these strains displayed the axial budding pattern typical of wild-type haploids (33Blacketer M.J. Koehler C.M. Coats S.G. Myers A.M. Madaule P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5567-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of PHD1, a putative transcriptional regulator, enhanced pseudohyphal growth in diploids but not in haploids despite the fact that it promoted the appearance of elongated haploid cells (41Gimeno C.J. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2100-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of CaN in the dimorphic transition of S. cerevisiae, if any at all, may be limited to the control of cell shape and budding pattern.A defined pattern of budding requires spatial information and the establishment of cell polarity. Our data indicate that CaN may affect the acquisition of cell polarity and regulate bud site selection in S. cerevisiae. First, constitutive CaN activation induced a developmental switch from the axial budding pattern typical of haploid cells to a polar pattern in which elongated cells formed new buds preferentially at the pole opposite to the birth pole of the mother cell. Second, inactivation of CaN by disruption of the CNB1 gene randomized the budding of DBY746 haploid cells. However, since not all cells expressing the recombinant CNAtr1/CNB calcineurin were elongated, and CaN deficiency did not randomize the budding pattern in all genetic backgrounds examined, the interaction of CaN with cell polarity and budding pattern seems indirect. Mutations in proteins determining general bud site selection or polarity establishment result in random budding (see Ref. 42Chant J. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, and references therein). Among the proteins required for cell polarity is the putative Ca2+-binding protein CDC24. Certain cdc24 mutations cause a random budding and sensitivity to high levels of Ca2+, and the interaction between CDC24 and BEM1 (a bud-site assembly protein) is affected by Ca2+ (42Chant J. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Zheng Y. Bender A. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 626-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, CAM concentrates at the site of bud formation before bud emergence, suggesting that CAM-regulated proteins may participate in polarized cell growth (20Brockerhoff S.E. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 29-619Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Whether CaN has a specific role in the control of cell morphology and budding pattern or the changes observed correlating with altered CaN activity are the result of perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis remains to be determined. INTRODUCTIONCalcineurin (CaN) 6The abbreviations used are: CaNcalcineurinCNAcatalytic subunit ACNBregulatory subunit BPCRpolymerase chain reactionMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase consisting of a catalytic subunit (CNA) and a regulatory subunit (CNB). CNA is inactive in the absence of the Ca2+-binding CNB subunit and the heterodimer CNA/CNB is activated by Ca2+ and calmodulin (CAM) binding (1Klee C.B. Draetta G.F. Hubbard M.J. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 149-200PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of CaN activity by Ca2+ is dual because Ca2+/CAM binding increases the Vmax and Ca2+/CNB increases the affinity of CaN for its substrate (2Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 3Perrino B.A. Ng L.Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 340-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At least four functional domains have been identified in the CNA subunit. The amino-terminal catalytic core, which has extensive similarity to type 2A protein phosphatases, is followed by a CNB-binding domain, a CAM-binding site, and an autoinhibitory domain (Fig. 1) (4Kincaid R. Shenolikar S. Nairn A.C. Advances in Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Research. Vol 27. Raven Press Ltd., New York1993: 1Google Scholar). The autoinhibitory domain likely functions as a competitive inhibitor that binds at or near the active site of the enzyme (5Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of Ca2+/CAM to CNA apparently activates CaN by displacing the autoinhibitory domain. Proteolytic removal of the calmodulin-binding and autoinhibitory domains of CaN yielded a core CNA/CNB heterodimer that was active in vitro in the absence of Ca2+/CAM, yet retained some responsiveness to free Ca2+, presumably through the Ca2+-binding CNB subunit (2Stemmer P.M. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6859-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 6Hubbard M.J. Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Transfection of Jurkat T-cells with a recombinant CNA subunit lacking the CAM-binding and autoinhibitory domains induced Ca2+-independent activation of the interleukin-2 promoter, suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal truncation was sufficient to activate CaN in vivo (5Parsons J.N. Wiederrecht G.J. Salowe S. Burbaum J.J. Rokosz L.L. Kincaid R.L. O'Keefe S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19610-19616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although an increasing number of CaN-dependent cellular processes are being identified in different eukaryotic systems, regulation of ion fluxes is clearly a principal function of CaN. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, CaN is essential for tolerance to Na+, Li+, and Mn2+ (7Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and participates in the regulation of the K+ uptake system (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, simultaneous inactivation of CaN and the vacuolar H+-ATPase are synthetically lethal, and regulation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase by CaN has been suggested (12Garrett-Engele P. Moilanen B. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4103-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Hemenway C.S. Dolinski K. Cardenas M.E. Hiller M.A. Jones E.W. Heitman J. Genetics. 1995; 141: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The monovalent cations K+ and Na+ share a common uptake system in S. cerevisiae. When challenged with growth inhibitory concentrations of Na+, yeast cells alter the kinetic properties of the K+ transport system increasing its affinity for K+ to restrict the influx of Na+ (14Haro R. Bañuelos M.A. Quintero F.J. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 868-874Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This response is dependent on a functional TRK1 gene, that encodes a putative K+ transporter involved in high affinity K+ uptake (15Ramos J. Contreras P. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 143: 88-93Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, Na+ induces the expression of ENA1, a gene encoding a P-type ATPase that mediates Na+ efflux, to restore low cytosolic Na+ levels (17Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We have shown that S. cerevisiae cells deficient in CaN activity become hypersensitive to Na+ and Li+ (an analog of Na+) because of an insufficient induction of ENA1 that results in low net ion efflux (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, although CaN mutants display a normal transition to the high affinity mode of K+ transport induced by K+ starvation, these cells fail to enter the high affinity mode in response to Na+ stress. These results imply that there are two signaling pathways controlling appropriate K+ homeostasis in S. cerevisiae. One of these signaling cascades responds to K+ starvation by an, as yet unknown, CaN-independent mechanism. The other signaling pathway is CaN-dependent and coordinates gene expression and activity of monovalent cation transporters in response to Na+ stress (8Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).CaN has also been implicated to function in the acquisition of cell polarity in eukaryotes. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a null CaN mutant lost cell polarity and produced branched cell divisions. Overexpression of CaN caused abnormal cell and nuclear shapes and spindle pole body positioning (18Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the initial outgrowth of neurites, CaN was localized to the tips of growth cones associated with the neuronal cytoskeleton, and CaN inhibitors prevented axonal elongation (19Ferreira A. Kincaid R. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1225-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A strikingly similar spatial distribution has been described for CAM in S. cerevisiae. In unbudded cells, CAM concentrated at the site of bud formation before bud emergence, then concentrated at the tip of the growing bud, and finally localized to the neck region before cytokinesis (20Brockerhoff S.E. Davis T.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 29-619Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CAM-regulated proteins may participate in polarized cell growth. No data on the localization of CaN in yeast cells are yet available.Here we show that constitutive activation of CaN results in an increased tolerance to toxic levels of Na+ and Li+. The activation of CaN can both substitute for and enhance Na+ stress signaling that mediates ion tolerance. Moreover, increased CaN activity elicits a developmental switch in the budding pattern of the yeast S. cerevisiae, whereas CaN depletion may interfere with acquisition of cell polarity."

Sperm specifically bind to ZP3, an 83-kDa glycoprotein which functions as both an adhesion molecule and as a secretagogue for acrosomal exocytosis (Litscher, E. S., and Wassarman, P. M. (1993) Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 5, 369-388). We used acid solubilized, 125I-labeled ZPs to quantify the initial binding event on mouse spermatozoa. Live sperm could not be used since solubilized ZPs rapidly initiated exocytosis. Instead, acrosome intact mouse sperm were briefly fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for binding studies using a standard filtration assay. The fixed sperm are suitable for sperm-zona binding assays based on two experiments: 1) incubating either live or fixed sperm in low concentrations of 125I-ZPs not sufficient to induce acrosomal exocytosis revealed no differences in binding up to 15 min and 2) solubilized, unlabeled ZPs competed for 125I-ZPs with an KI of approximately 3.78 n. Sperm-125I-ZP binding reached equilibrium with a τ1/2 of ∼22 min at 37°C. Affinity parameters were calculated using the well substantiated assumption that only ZP3 binds intact mouse sperm. The on-rate constant for association of 125I-ZP binding to the mouse sperm surface was calculated to be 3.2 × 106−1 min−1. The saturation binding isotherm revealed that there are approximately 30,000 binding sites, ascribed to ZP3, with an EC50 of 1.29 n. Further analysis indicated that this binding is complex (Hill coefficient = 1.72), suggesting involvement of multiple receptors on the sperm surface and/or multiple ligand moieties. High and low affinity ZP binding sites on the sperm surface were confirmed by dissociation experiments. 125I-ZP dissociation was clearly biphasic, and kinetic off-rate constants of 0.161 min−1 and 0.0023 min−1 were calculated for the low and high affinity sites, respectively. Apparent affinities (Kd values) of 50 n for the low affinity and 0.72 n for the high affinity interaction were calculated from the rate constants. These data demonstrate that the initial adhesion event between mouse sperm and the zona pellucida is a high affinity event which is sufficient to tether a sperm to the extracellular matrix prior to the induction of acrosomal exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W1981741037,"A new tRNA, THG73, has been designed and evaluated as a vehicle for incorporating unnatural amino acids site-specifically into proteins expressed <i>in vivo</i> using the stop codon suppression technique. The construct is a modification of tRNA<sup>Gln</sup>(CUA) from <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i>, which naturally recognizes the stop codon UAG. Using electrophysiological studies of mutations at several sites of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, it is established that THG73 represents a major improvement over previous nonsense suppressors both in terms of efficiency and fidelity of unnatural amino acid incorporation. Compared with a previous tRNA used for <i>in vivo</i> suppression, THG73 is as much as 100-fold less likely to be acylated by endogenous synthetases of the <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte. This effectively eliminates a major concern of the <i>in vivo</i> suppression methodology, the undesirable incorporation of natural amino acids at the suppression site. In addition, THG73 is 4-10-fold more efficient at incorporating unnatural amino acids in the oocyte system. Taken together, these two advances should greatly expand the range of applicability of the <i>in vivo</i> nonsense suppression methodology."

The effect of oxidative stress on protein metabolism have been reported by various laboratories (1Levine R.L. J. Biol.

With respect to protein synthesis, the effect of active oxygen species has been less studied and has been addressed by using oxidizing agents (14Poot M. Verkerk A. Koster J.F. Esterbauer H.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref Scopus (4464) Google Scholar). Besides its damaging effects such as membrane damage, cell lysis, organ necrosis, tumor promotion (20Taffe B.G. Takahashi N. Kensler T.W. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12143-12149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and certain aspects of aging (23Wendel A. Feuerstein S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2513-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it has been reported that this compound and/or cytotoxic aldehydes derived from it inhibit protein synthesis in human skin fibroblasts (14Poot M. Verkerk A. Koster J.F. Esterbauer H. Jongkind J.F. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1988; 43: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These in vitro results were obtained by measuring the incorporation of radioactive amino acid precursors into proteins, a methodology which is not suitable when using whole animal systems because of the difficulty in measuring the specific activity of the amino acid precursor pool (23Wendel A. Feuerstein S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2513-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a detailed molecular mechanism of the decline of protein synthesis caused by the oxidant is not available. cumene hydroperoxide elongation factor 2 diphtheria toxin malonaldehyde thiobarbituric acid polyribosomes peptides. Because of the potential importance of decreased protein synthesis in structural and functional deterioration of the cell, the molecular basis for decreased rate of protein synthesis by CH, and hence by oxidative stress, is of interest, especially since this decrease may be an important contributor to certain processes in which free radicals seem to be involved, such as aging (25Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism underlying the inhibition of protein synthesis by CH, we have studied: 1) which of the individual steps in polypeptide synthesis is most affected, and 2) the possible mechanism of how active oxygen species may interact with the protein synthetic machinery. The effect of CH on the stages of protein synthesis has been studied by investigating the ribosome half-transit time (elongation time) required for the synthesis of an average half-length of a nascent polypeptide chain (26Scornik O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3876-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the ribosomal state of aggregation (27Henshaw E.C. Hirsch C.A. Morton B.E. Hiatt H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 436-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Martin-Requero A. Perez-Diaz J. Parrilla R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7785-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is reflected by the polyribosomal profiles. The results show that the CH treatment for 7 days produced a decrease in the rate of peptide chain elongation along with a higher state of polyribosome aggregation in rat liver. These findings suggest that the elongation step is the more sensitive to CH treatment. The observed decline in the rate of elongation step seems to be produced by modifications of the EF-2, the main protein involved in this process. Female Wistar rats, 200 g body weight, were used in all the experiments. CH (Sigma, 80%) was dissolved in saline and the solution was sonicated for 5 s at 50 watts. CH-treated rats received an intraperitoneal injection of CH (35 mg/kg body weight/day) at 10 a.m. for 7 days. The control group received NaCl injection. We followed the weight of each animal and found that the rate of increase was similar for all rats used. Liver polyribosomal profiles were determined basically as described previously (27Henshaw E.C. Hirsch C.A. Morton B.E. Hiatt H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 436-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Martin-Requero A. Perez-Diaz J. Parrilla R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7785-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A portion of liver was homogenized in 2 volumes of a media containing 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl, 0.25 sucrose (pH 7.3). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g and 2.3 ml of the supernatant were mixed with 0.3 ml of 20% sodium deoxycholate and 5.2 ml of 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl, 2.3 sucrose, 7 m 2-mercaptoethanol (pH 7.3). This mixture was layered over 3.4 ml of a solution containing 2.3 sucrose, 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl (pH 7.3), and 0.6 ml of a 105,000 × g supernatant obtained by 2 h ultracentrifugation of control liver homogenate (1:2) in 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl, 0.25 sucrose (pH 7.3). The preparation was centrifuged for 16 h at 150,000 × g in the Beckman rotor 65. The pellet was gently suspended in a medium containing 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl (pH 7.3) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. The absorbance of the suspension at 260 nm was monitored and a volume containing 4 units of OD was layered on 10 ml of a 20-40% linear sucrose gradient made up in the same buffer. The gradient was centrifuged in an SW 40.1 Beckman rotor for 35 min at 35,000 rpm and pumped from the tube using a gradient unloader (Nycomed Pharma). The absorbance at 254 nm was continuously recorded using a flow-through cuvette. A blank obtained by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm of 10 ml of the 20-40% sucrose gradient was subtracted from all polyribosomal profiles. The area under the curve in polyribosomal pattern was quantified using a laser computing densitometer. The procedure for the determination of radioactivity in total and nascent proteins was similar to the one described previously (26Scornik O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3876-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Hirsch C.A. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4394-4399PubMed Google Scholar) and was as follows. The animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital (5 mg/100 g weight). The abdomen of the rat was opened along the ventral midline. The hepatic portal vein was exposed by gently shifting the intestines within the abdominal cavity, and an injection of 20 μCi of -[3,4-3H]valine in 0.2 ml of NaCl solution was made over a period of 30 s. The needle was kept in the vein to prevent bleeding. Small liver biopsies were taken 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 min after the completion of the amino acid administration, taking only two biopsies from each liver (at 0.5 and 1.5 min or at 1 and 2 min). To prevent hemorrhage, liver lobules were ligated immediately before biopsies were taken. Liver samples were frozen by aluminum clamps pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen and stored at this temperature until they were homogenized in 3 volumes of 0.3 sucrose. A 1.5-ml portion of the homogenate was diluted with 1.5 ml of a medium containing 0.1 Tris/HCl (pH 7.6) and 2 m magnesium acetate. The mixture was layered over 1 ml of 0.5 sucrose containing 1 m magnesium acetate and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min. Two ml of the supernatant were mixed with 200 μl of 20% sodium deoxycholate. After 30 min at 4°C, the solution was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting supernatant was used to estimate the radioactivity of total liver protein and the ribosomal nascent polypeptide chains. To measure radioactivity of total liver protein, 0.5 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After sedimenting at 8,000 × g for 10 min, the pellet was washed twice with 3 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After the last wash, the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml 10% trichloroacetic acid and heated for 30 min at 90°C. The precipitate collected by centrifugation was resuspended successively in 3 ml of ethanol/chloroform/ether (2:2:1, v/v), acetone and ether. The washed pellet was left at room temperature until the ether had evaporated. The dry pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of protosol, allowed to stand overnight at 60°C, and after adding 17 μl of acetic acid, transferred to a vial containing 10 ml of toluene-2,5-diphenyl oxazol scintillation mixture. The incorporation of radioactive amino acid into nascent chains was determined using 1.5 ml of supernatant. This volume was layered over 6 ml of a medium containing 1 sucrose, 1 m magnesium acetate, and 1 ml of a 105,000 × g supernatant obtained by 2 h ultracentrifugation of control liver homogenate (1:2) in 50 m triethanolamine, 5 m MgCl2, 25 m KCl, and 0.25 sucrose (pH 7.3). The mixture was centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 14 h in a Beckman 42 Ti rotor at 0°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of distilled water. This suspension was treated as already described for the determination of radioactivity in total proteins. To confirm that the injection of radioactive valine had been done properly, a sample of blood was taken from the heart. Aliquots of 10 μl of serum were transferred to vials containing 10 ml of Formula-989 liquid scintillation mixture (NEN Research Products) for the determination of radioactivity. An average of 2,200 cpm was obtained. Fifty μl of homogenates from liver were deproteinized with 1 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to vials containing 10 ml of toluene-based scintillation mixture for the determination of radioactivity. A portion of liver tissue was homogenated in 5 volumes of 50 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.2 m dithiothreitol and 0.3 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 105,000 × g. The pellet was gently suspended in homogenization buffer. The sample (liver microsome suspension or 10,000 × g supernatant) was mixed with 2 volumes of cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid to precipitate protein. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation, and an aliquot of the supernatant was used for MDA determination (30Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide (H-CGTRFTDTRKDEQGC-NH2) corresponding to a particular region of EF-2 (Chiron Mimotopes Peptide Systems, Australia) was used to prepare rabbit polyclonal antibodies against EF-2. The synthetic peptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using a conjugation kit of Pierce. The specificity of the polyclonal antibody was tested by immunostaining of nitrocellulose membranes after electrophoretic transfer of rat liver homogenates. A Western blot of an SDS-gel electrophoresis of liver homogenate yielded a single band at the expected molecular mass of 100 kDa. Concentration of EF-2 in the cell-free systems was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. A sample of liver extract was diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) (100 μg of protein/ml). The wells of a Nunc microtiter plate were coated, in triplicate, with 100 μl and incubated overnight at 4°C. Unbound sites were blocked with 200 μl of 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin-Tween. After rinsing, 100 μl of anti-EF-2 solution diluted 1/100 in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was then washed as before and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mouse anti-rabbit Ig-peroxidase. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, 100 μl of substrate solution (10 mg of 2,2′-azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate(6)] diammonium salt dissolved in 100 ml of citrate buffer (pH 5.8) containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide) were distributed into each well. The reaction was left to develop for 60 min at room temperature, in the dark. A sample of liver was homogenated in 3 volumes of homogenization buffer containing 50 m Tris-HCl, 1 m EDTA, 1 m dithiothreitol, 50 m NaCl, 0.25 sucrose, and 0.2 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was shaken vigorously in charcoal for 5 min to remove endogenous NAD. Charcoal was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 20 min) and the supernatant was centrifuged again (27,000 × g, 15 min) to remove cellular debris and to ensure elimination of all charcoal. All operations were performed at 0-4°C. The amount of “active” EF-2 was determined in liver extracts as described previously (31Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Clark B.F.C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1989; 19: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Riis B. Rattan S.I.S. Cavallius J. Clark B.F.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay was performed in a final volume of 500 μl in a buffer of 20 m Tris-HCl, 50 m dithiothreitol, and 1 m EDTA, containing 10 μg of diphtheria toxin (DT), 0.18 histamine, and 0.1 m [14C]NAD (0.1 μCi). The reaction was started by mixing in an aliquot of liver extract and the assay mixture was incubated 90 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of cold 10% perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the radioactivity incorporated into the protein pellet was determined as described above. Carbonyl groups were determined by measurement of incorporation of tritium into proteins after reduction with NaB3[H]4 as described by Lenz et al. (33Lenz A.-G. Costabel U. Shaltiel S. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A sample of hepatic 105,000 × g supernatant was labeled with radioactive sodium borohydride (33Lenz A.-G. Costabel U. Shaltiel S. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, samples were extensively dialyzed in a Microdialyzer system 500 (Pierce) using a 12,000 Mr cut-off dialysis membrane. Polyclonal antibody against EF-2 was incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) for 4 h at 4°C. The complex was washed three times in 10 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 140 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS (RIPA buffer). An aliquot of the radiolabeled sample was incubated with the complex protein A-antibody overnight at 4°C. The samples were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge and the immunoprecipitate was washed three times with RIPA buffer. Radioactivity incorporated into EF-2 was determined using 10 ml of Ready-Protein liquid scintillation mixture (Beckman Instruments). Rat liver homogenate (105,000 × g supernatant) was treated with 1 m CH for 90 min. After this, CH and endogenous NAD were removed by extensive dialysis. Carbonyl group content of EF-2 was determined using tritiated sodium borohydride (33Lenz A.-G. Costabel U. Shaltiel S. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). For the measurement of ribosylatable-diphthamide content of EF-2, the control and oxidized sample were treated with radioactive NAD plus DT. Radioactivity incorporated into EF-2 was determined as described above. CH is an oxidant, which has been used to assess the effects of free radicals and reactive oxygen intermediates on various biological molecules (17Sies H. Summer K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 18Shimura J. Shimura F. Hosoya N. Biochim. Biophys.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref Scopus (4464) Google Scholar). In the present study, the oxidative effect of CH has been determined by measuring MDA and carbonyl groups content in liver extracts. Aldehydes are always produced when lipid hydroperoxides break down in biological systems (29Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Hirsch C.A. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4394-4399PubMed Google Scholar), and MDA is the most abundant individual aldehyde resulting from lipid peroxidation. Its determination by thiobarbituric acid is one of the most common assays in lipid peroxidation studies (30Esterbauer H. Cheeseman K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 407-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (2890) Google Scholar). In addition, the carbonyl groups content in proteins is used as an index of protein oxidative damage (33Lenz A.-G. Costabel U. Shaltiel S. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). CH treatment produced a significant increase in MDA of 2.7- and 3.4-fold in 10,000 × g supernatant and microsome fraction, respectively (Table I). A significant increase of carbonyl groups content of liver proteins was also found in both subcellular fractions (Table I).Table I.Effect of CH treatment on MDA level and carbonyl groups content of proteins and EF-2ControlCHMDA (nmol/mg protein)10,000 × g supernatantd22.4 ± 2.353.2 ± 18.0a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, p < 0.05).bF = 32.43, p = 0.0047.(5)(5)Microsomes28.8 ± 10.597.4 ± 9.6a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, p < 0.05).cF = 17.36, p = 0.0141.(5)(5)CO content in proteins (nmol CO group/mg protein)10,000 × g supernatant155.2 ± 8.1249.0 ± 10.7a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, p < 0.05).dF = 35.4, p = 0.0095.(5)(5)Microsomes408.5 ± 105831.9 ± 37.8a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, p < 0.05).eF = 14.18, p = 0.0197.(5)(5)a Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA followed by Tukey's test, p < 0.05).b F = 32.43, p = 0.0047.c F = 17.36, p = 0.0141.d F = 35.4, p = 0.0095.e F = 14.18, p = 0.0197. Open table in a new tab Polypeptide chain completion time was calculated assuming that after injection, the radioactive amino acid will meet the ribosomes in the middle of the translation of a mRNA of average size. When a full cycle is completed, the whole peptide on the ribosomes will be labeled, while the chains that have been terminated and released will be only half-labeled. Thus, the ratio between the radioactivity incorporated into nascent peptides in the polyribosomes (Pn) and that incorporated into total peptides (Pt) will be reduced by 50%, and the time required to reduce Pn/Pt from 50 to 25% is taken as the average polypeptide chain completion time, Tc (26Scornik O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3876-3883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Henshaw E.C. Hirsch C.A. Morton B.E. Hiatt H.H. J. Biol.

Changes in Tc reflect changes in elongation rate and termination. This seems to be true in as far as the specific radioactivity of the precursor does not change over the 2-min period (28Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Martin-Requero A. Perez-Diaz J. Parrilla R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7785-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Hirsch C.A. Henshaw E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4394-4399PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, the total acid-soluble valine specific radioactivity was determined at each experimental time. The results were 368.7 ± 17.8 cpm for control rats and 356.7 ± 19.11 cpm for CH-treated rats (mean ± S.E. of 10 animals), with no significant changes at different times between 30 and 120 s. These small variations were not statistically significant as determined by ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test. In our experiments, Tc was obtained directly from the slope of a plot of Pn/Pt versus time. Fig. 1 summarizes the values of hepatic Pn/Pt at different times after injection of the tracer in control (Fig. 1a) and CH-treated rats (Fig. 1b). The value Pn/Pt was reduced from 50 to 25% in 60 s in the normal liver and in 101 s in the CH-treated one (see legend to Fig. 1). The polypeptide chain completion time is an expression of the rate of the peptide chain elongation and termination steps. It is independent of the number of ribosomes engaged in the process and it should not be affected by variations in the initiation step (28Ayuso-Parrilla M.S. Martin-Requero A. Perez-Diaz J. Parrilla R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7785-7790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in order to determine whether the effect observed by CH treatment was accompanied by a significant effect of the initiation step, the ribosomal state of aggregation was determined by studying the hepatic polyribosomal profiles in control and CH-treated rats. As shown in Fig. 2, CH treatment increased the ribosomal state of aggregation (Fig. 2b) with respect to controls (Fig. 2a). An increase of 69% in the ratio polysomes/monomers was observed in CH-treated rats (see legend to Fig. 2). These results indicate that CH treatment acts preferentially on the elongation or termination step, or both. We have measured the total content of EF-2 using the polyclonal antibody against EF-2. As can be seen in Table II, there is no change in the total amount of EF-2 in CH-treated rat with respect to control rats. Moreover, we have used the diphtheria toxin-mediated 1:1 stoichiometric ADP-ribosylation of the diphthamide residue of EF-2 in liver extract in the presence of radioactive NAD, to determine the amount ADP-ribosylatable EF-2 and, hence, of active EF-2 (31Riis B.

Our results show that the amounts of ADP-ribosylatable EF-2 are reduced significantly (32% reduction) during the treatment of CH as measured by the content of diphtheria toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylatable EF-2 (Table II).Table II.Effect of CH treatment on the amount of total and active EF-2 and on its oxidation stateControl ratsCH-treated ratsAmount of total EF-2 (absorbance @ 405 nm)0.173 ± 0.0100.197 ± 0.016ADP-ribosylatable EF-2 (pmol/mg protein)13.54 ± 1.488.92 ± 1.03a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA, Tukey's test, p < 0.05).bF = 6.96, p = 0.0386.CO content in EF-2 (nmol CO group/mg protein)3.58 ± 0.535.60 ± 0.39a,Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA, Tukey's test, p < 0.05).cF = 85.46, p = 0.0008.a Significantly different from level in control rats (multifactor ANOVA, Tukey's test, p < 0.05).b F = 6.96, p = 0.0386.c F = 85.46, p = 0.0008. Open table in a new tab CH treatment also modified the oxidation state of EF-2. For this experiment a polyclonal antibody against EF-2 was used. The carbonyl content of immunoprecipitated EF-2 from rats treated with CH was significantly increased (2-fold) (Table I), which suggests that EF-2 is highly affected by oxidative damage. A control experiment was done to study the effect of CH on control EF-2 present in liver homogenates. As shown in Fig. 3, pretreatment with CH resulted in a 45% decreased incorporation of [14C]ADP-ribose, which suggests that CH specifically produced a decrease in the amount of active EF-2. In addition, treatment of rat liver homogenates with CH produced a 1.8-fold increase in the carbonyl group content of EF-2. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition produced by the oxidative stress mediated by CH. CH is an oxidant that has been used as a model compound to assess the effect of oxidative stress on various biological systems (17Sies H. Summer K.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 503-512Crossr"

Inflamm. 45, 297-312; Lowell, C. A., Fumagalli, L., and Berton, G. (1996) J. Cell Biol. 133, 895-910). Because the activity of tyrosine kinases can be affected by oxidants, we investigated whether reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) produced by adherent neutrophils regulate Src family kinase activities. Inhibition of ROI production by diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, or degradation of H2O2 by exogenously added catalase inhibited the adhesion-stimulated activities of p58c-fgr and p53/56lyn. In addition, adhesion-stimulated p58c-fgr and p53/56lyn activities were greatly reduced in neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) that are deficient in the production of ROI. Exogenously added H2O2 increased p58c-fgr and p53/56lyn activities in nonadherent neutrophils. Although ROI regulated the activities of p58c-fgr and p53/56lyn, they did not affect the redistribution of the two kinases to a Triton X-100-insoluble, cytoskeletal fraction that occurs in adherent neutrophils. Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in adherent, CGD neutrophils was only partially inhibited, suggesting that the full activation of p58c-fgr and p53/56lyn, which depends on endogenously produced ROI, does not represent an absolute requirement for protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The adhesion-stimulated activity of the tyrosine kinase p72syk was not affected by catalase in normal neutrophils, and it was comparable in normal and CGD neutrophils. These findings suggest that ROI endogenously produced by adherent neutrophils regulate Src family kinases activity selectively and establish the existence of a cross-talk between reorganization of the cytoskeleton, production of ROI, and Src family tyrosine kinase activities in signaling by adhesion.

Several G proteins, including growth factor receptor binding protein 2, SOS Ras and Rac, also play an important role in transmitting the proper signal to protein kinases, such as MEKK and JNKK, which, in turn, activate JNK (10Sanchez I.

A focal point in the activation of diverse signal transduction pathways is p21ras, which appears to serve as a docking site for the binding of Raf-1 (12Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) JNK and its substrate c-Jun (13Adler V. Pincus M.R. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Ronai Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the Raf-1-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway results in the activation of transcription factors other than those activated by the MEKK and JNKK pathway (i.e. c-Fos and c-Jun, respectively), certain cross-talk between the two pathways appears to exist (14Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have recently found that the p21ras protein stimulates phosphorylation of JNK and enhances JNK-catalyzed phosphorylation of c-Jun (13Adler V.

We obtained additional evidence that p21ras interacts directly with both c-Jun and JNK proteins. This interaction is inhibited by specific peptides, corresponding to the effector domains of p21ras (residues 35-47, 96-110, and 115-126) identified in molecular modeling studies (13Adler V.

Res. 1992; 20: 809-811Google Scholar).Since p21ras appears to be involved in the JNK-Jun signaling pathway, we have undertaken a study to determine whether in vivo activation of these two proteins is p21ras-dependent. For this purpose, we have used the cell line M1311, NIH-3T3 cells that carry the cDNA for the neutralizing antibodies to p21ras, Y13-259. Although the heavy chain of these antibodies is constitutively expressed in M1311 cells, the light chain cDNA is under a dexamethasone-inducible promoter; thus, upon exposure to dexamethasone, there is expression of functional Y13-259 antibodies that are capable of reverting the transformed phenotype in these cells (19Montano X. Jimenez A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 597-605PubMed Google Scholar). Using the M1311 cell system as a model, we demonstrate the contribution of p21ras to UV-mediated JNK activation.DISCUSSIONWe previously found that p21ras binds to purified bacterially expressed JNK and Jun proteins (13Adler V. Pincus M.R. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Ronai Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10585-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The present studies further confirm this interaction both in vitro and in functional in vivo-based assays. These studies demonstrate that p21ras-bound JNK is increased after UV treatment, and that depletion of p21ras from protein extracts results in a marked decrease in JNK activity. That the amount of p21ras-bound JNK depends on cellular stress and increases significantly after UV irradiation points to a role for p21ras in UV-mediated JNK activation. Although immunodepletion with antibodies to p21ras resulted in about a 50% decrease in JNK activity, antibodies to JNK reduced this activity twice as efficiently, indicating that about one-half of the cellular JNK is bound to p21ras.To probe the physiological significance of the direct interaction between p21ras and JNK and Jun, we have used a model cell system in which p21ras activation is blocked by an endogenously produced anti- p21ras neutralizing antibody. Induction of Y13-259 antibody expression in the NIH-3T3 (M1311) cell line blocked the activation of JNK since JNK-induced phosphorylation of Jun diminished over a 5-day period, corresponding to increased expression of the anti-p21ras antibody (Fig. 2). Expression of ras cDNA, which lacks the recognition site for these antibodies, as seen in the DL6373 cells, restored the ability of UV to activate JNK, further supporting the conclusion that it is Ras inactivation that led to impaired JNK activation in M1311 cells. An independent support for the role of Ras-JNK interaction in JNK activation by UV comes from experiments in which a peptide corresponding to a Ras domain required for interaction with the kinase (amino acids 96-110) was introduced into M1311 cells, where it inhibited JNK activation after UV irradiation (Fig. 7). When dexamethasone was added to the medium allowing expression of Y13-259 antibodies, the inhibition mediated by this peptide was found to be synergistic with that induced by the antibody itself. Further support for p21ras-mediated JNK activation upon UV irradiation comes from the observation that JNK activation by heat shock, an alternate form of stress using different cellular pathways that do not require membrane integrity (7Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), was not inhibited in dexamethasone-maintained M1311 cells.Our findings that membrane-bound p21ras binds to JNK and is required for its activation imply that JNK (and Jun) may become activated at or near the cell membrane. Interestingly, protein extracts prepared in the presence of Triton X-114, which was shown to extract p21ras from the membrane, led to the identification of JNK as a p21ras-bound protein. 2V. Adler, M. R. Pincus, and Z. Ronai, unpublished observations. Recent studies suggest that JNK binds to growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (11Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Shafman T. Emoto Y. Taneja N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 18871-18874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the adapter protein that links tyrosine kinase receptors to the SOS protein, which, in turn, activates p21ras by promoting GTP/GDP exchange. Although these findings suggest that JNK may be activated in the cytosol near the cell membrane, different JNK isozymes may be activated by alternate pathways, which include nuclear DNA lesions formed after UV irradiation (21Adler V. Pincus M.R. Posner S. Upadhyaya P. El-Bayoumy K. Ronai Z. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of JNK was demonstrated recently to occur in UV-treated cells (30Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F-X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5957-5964Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar).Expression of the anti-p21ras antibody Y13-259 in the NIH-3T3 (M1311) cells was also found to strongly inhibit transcriptional activation, as evidenced by weaker complexes and decreasing transcriptional activities measured by gel shift and CAT assays using the URE as a target sequence. The latter indicates that p21ras-associated JNK may play an important role in mediating the transcriptional activation of the JNK substrates tested here, viz c-Jun and ATF2.Because other kinases (i.e. p54 and p38) were also shown capable of phosphorylating ATF2, which forms a heterodimer with c-Jun for binding to the URE (24Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that the mechanism of inhibition of URE-DNA binding activity, although Ras-dependent, is not solely related to JNK. Similarly, dexamethasone inhibition of URE-CAT activities in M1311 cells may not be confined to JNK inhibition. Further elucidating JNK-related transcriptional activities in Ras-dependent and -independent pathways will allow us to clarify the complex regulation of AP1 and ATF2 activities. Changes in JNK activity are likely to also affect its substrate stability, as shown for c-Jun, which is targeted by JNK for ubiquitination in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (31Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L.R. Davis R. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1529-1533Google Scholar). In all, the functional significance of UV-mediated Ras-dependent transcriptional activities is expected to affect cell ability to cope with the UV effect via changes at the level of DNA repair, cell cycle, and possibly apoptosis.

A focal point in the activation of diverse signal transduction pathways is p21ras, which appears to serve as a docking site for the binding of Raf-1 (12Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1588-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) JNK and its substrate c-Jun (13Adler V. Pincus M.R. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Ronai Z.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10585-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the Raf-1-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway results in the activation of transcription factors other than those activated by the MEKK and JNKK pathway (i.e. c-Fos and c-Jun, respectively), certain cross-talk between the two pathways appears to exist (14Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have recently found that the p21ras protein stimulates phosphorylation of JNK and enhances JNK-catalyzed phosphorylation of c-Jun (13Adler V.

We obtained additional evidence that p21ras interacts directly with both c-Jun and JNK proteins. This interaction is inhibited by specific peptides, corresponding to the effector domains of p21ras (residues 35-47, 96-110, and 115-126) identified in molecular modeling studies (13Adler V.

For this purpose, we have used the cell line M1311, NIH-3T3 cells that carry the cDNA for the neutralizing antibodies to p21ras, Y13-259. Although the heavy chain of these antibodies is constitutively expressed in M1311 cells, the light chain cDNA is under a dexamethasone-inducible promoter; thus, upon exposure to dexamethasone, there is expression of functional Y13-259 antibodies that are capable of reverting the transformed phenotype in these cells (19Montano X. Jimenez A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 597-605PubMed Google Scholar). Using the M1311 cell system as a model, we demonstrate the contribution of p21ras to UV-mediated JNK activation."

Deletion of these elements leads to significant promoter activity in cell lines such as HEL and K562 that do not normally express gp91phox. The −100 to +12 base pair gp91phox promoter region is sufficient to direct maximal de-repressed transcription in these cells. However, promoter activity is dramatically decreased following a 16-base pair truncation that deletes an interferon-stimulated response element. This element interacts with IRF-1 and IRF-2, members of the interferon regulatory factor family of transcription factors. In addition, this promoter region is bound by a factor with properties similar to BID, a DNA-binding protein that also interacts with three upstream sites within the gp91phox promoter. Transient transfection studies using mutated promoters indicate that both the IRF and BID binding sites are required for maximal gp91phox promoter activity.

INTRODUCTIONThe gp91phox gene encodes the cytochrome b558 heavy chain of the NADPH-dependent oxidase and is required for the generation of toxic free radicals and microbicidal activity by phagocytes (1Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Absence of gp91phox leads to the immunodeficiency syndrome chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) 1The abbreviations used are: CGDchronic granulomatous diseaseBIDbinding increased during differentiationbpbase pair(s)CDPCCAAT displacement protein, DIF, differentiation induced factorEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaygalgalactosidaseHAFhematopoietic associated factorICSBPIFN consensus sequence binding proteinIFNinterferonIRFinterferon regulatory factorISGFIFN-stimulated gene factorISREIFN-stimulated response elementPIPPU.1 interaction partnerCMVcytomegalovirusMATEmyeloid activating transcription element. (1Babior B.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1995; 2: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The gp91phox gene is expressed nearly exclusively in terminally differentiating myeloid cells (2Royer-Pokora B. Kunkel L.M. Monaco A.P. Goff S.C. Newburger P.E. Baehner R.L. Cole F.S. Curnutte J.T. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1986; 322: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), is transcriptionally induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (3Newburger P.E. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Whitney C. Wright J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5215-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and provides an attractive system to study the regulation of myeloid cell gene expression and development.Previous studies demonstrated that the −450 to +12 bp region of the gp91phox promoter directs transcription in a subset of monocyte/macrophages in transgenic mice (4Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and also in response to IFN-γ in stably transfected PLB985 myeloid cells (5Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Complex interactions between cis elements and DNA-binding proteins occur within this promoter region (Fig. 1). Highly related if not identical DNA-binding proteins denoted BID (binding increased during differentiation) bind to three sites centered at −355 bp (DIST-BID), −225 bp (MID-BID), and −145 bp (PROX-BID) of the gp91phox promoter. These interactions are required for IFN-γ-induced transcription. 2Eklund, E., Luo, W., and Skalnik, D. (1996) J. Immunol., in press. The MID-BID element conforms to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), and is also a binding site for IFN regulatory factors (IRF).2 In addition, the binding of a novel factor, HAF-1 (hematopoietic associated factor-1), to a site at −57 bp is also required for IFN-γ induction of the gp91phox promoter (5Eklund E.A. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8267-8273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mutations of the HAF-1 binding site have been reported in two kindreds of CGD patients who fail to normally transcribe the gp91phox gene (6Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Anklesarian P. Erickson R.W. Rae J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.J. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, a CCAAT box located at −123 to −119 bp of the gp91phox promoter is recognized by CP1, a ubiquitous CCAAT box binding activity (8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of these transcriptional activating factors are myeloid-specific.The restriction of gp91phox promoter activity to mature phagocytes requires regulated transcriptional repression mediated by the binding of CCAAT displacement protein (CDP). Four CDP binding sites have been detected centered at −350, −220, −150, and −110 bp of the gp91phox promoter. Each CDP binding site overlaps BID or CP1 binding sites, and binding of CDP excludes these transcriptional activating factors (8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).2 The binding of CDP to each site is down-regulated during myeloid differentiation, coincident with induction of gp91phox expression (8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and constitutive expression of CDP prevents gp91phox induction during terminal myeloid differentiation (10Lievens P.M.J. Donady J.J. Tufarelli C. Neufeld E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12745-12750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Ablation of CDP binding sites results in increased gp91phox promoter activity in HEL, K562, and HeLa cells that do not normally express gp91phox, a phenomenon termed de-repression (8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).The −100 to +12 bp region of the gp91phox gene, which lacks upstream repressor elements, directs transcription in nonphagocytic cells (9Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activating elements within this region of the endogenous gp91phox promoter are presumably interfered with by CDP binding in nonphagocytic cells and are possibly also required for appropriate transcription in mature myeloid cells. The purpose of this study was to identify cis elements and cognate DNA-binding proteins within this promoter region that are required for gp91phox promoter activity. We describe a cis element between −100 and −85 bp of the gp91phox promoter that is required for promoter activity in the absence of repression and which binds members of the IRF family and a factor similar to BID.DISCUSSIONThis study examines the cis elements and cognate DNA-binding proteins that are required for gp91phox promoter activity in the absence of CDP-mediated repression. Characterization of these elements should identify promoter components that are interfered with by transcriptional repression in nonphagocytic cells and which are also possibly required for appropriate gp91phox expression in mature myeloid cells in which CDP DNA-binding activity is down-regulated.The results demonstrate that the region between −100 and −85 bp is required for gp91phox promoter activity. An ISRE at −92 to −80 bp serves as a binding site for IRF-1 and IRF-2, which were originally identified as important regulators of interferon and virus-induced genes (33Harada H. Fujita T.

Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that IRF-1 and IRF-2 are also involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, transformation, and apoptosis (37Harada H. Kitagawa M. Tanaka N. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Ishihara M. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 38Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T. Matsuyama T. Lamphier M.S. Aizawa S. Mak T.W.

Taniguchi T. Nature. 1995; 376: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IRF-1 and IRF-2 play critical roles during hematopoiesis. IRF-1 is involved in growth inhibition during myeloid differentiation induced by interleukin-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (40Abdollahi A. Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar), and deletion of IRF-1 is frequently observed in human leukemia and preleukemia myelodysplasia (41Willman C.L. Sever C.E. Pallavicini M.G. Harada H. Tanaka N. Slovak M.L. Yamamoto H. Harada K. Meeker T.C. List A.F. Taniguchi T. Science. 1993; 259: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). IRF-1 is also required for the induction of the nitric oxide synthase gene in macrophages (42Matsuyama T. Kimura T. Kitagawa M. Pfeffer K. Kawakami T. Watanabe N. Kundig T.M. Amakawa R. Kishihara K. Wakeham A. Potter J. Furlonger C.L. Narendran A. Suzuki H. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Taniguchi T. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 75: 83-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). IRF-1 null mice exhibit impaired development of CD8+ T cells (43Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), while B lymphopoiesis is suppressed in IRF-2 deficient mice (44Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).The significance of the −92 to −80 bp IRF binding site in mediating gp91phox promoter activity is confirmed by transient transfections in which specific ablation of this element results in decreased promoter activity in both HEL and K562 cells. The transcriptional activating activity of both IRF-1 and IRF-2 is further demonstrated by the ability of each to transactivate the gp91phox promoter, an effect dependent on an intact ISRE. Abundant IRF-2 levels in HEL cells indicate that IRF-2, and not IRF-1, mediates transcription via the ISRE in this system. Furthermore, IRF-2 DNA-binding activity is dominant over that of IRF-1 in a macrophage cell line that expresses the gp91phox gene, indicating that IRF-2 may also be involved in directing expression of the gp91phox gene in mature myeloid cells. However, these findings do not exclude a role for IRF-1 in the myeloid-specific induction of gp91phox expression following IFN-γ stimulation. When present in nuclear extract, IRF-1 does bind to the downstream ISRE, and transactivation studies indicate that IRF-1 induces approximately twice the expression from the −100 to +12 bp gp91phox promoter as that produced by IRF-2.IRF-2 has generally been described as a transcriptional repressor and functions by competing with the transcriptional activator IRF-1 for DNA-binding sites (33Harada H. Fujita T. Miyamoto M. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Furia A. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 58: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 36Yamamoto H. Lamphier M.S. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Harada H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1423-1428PubMed Google Scholar). However, IRF-2 contains a latent transcriptional activation domain (36Yamamoto H. Lamphier M.S. Fujita T. Taniguchi T. Harada H. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1423-1428PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent study demonstrates that overexpression of IRF-2 causes a 2-fold activation of the histone H4 promoter (28Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Hence, IRF-2 is similar to factors such as YY1, RAP-1, Dorsal, and Kruppel that exhibit both transcriptional activation and repression activities (45Lee T.C. Zhang Y. Schwartz R.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1047-1052PubMed Google Scholar, 46Sussel Shore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7749-7753Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 47Lehming N. Thanos D.

Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal a second example of the ability of IRF-2 to function as a transcriptional activator. The relative strength of the transcriptional activating activity of IRF-2 on the gp91phox promoter is comparable to that reported for IRF-2 action on the histone H4 promoter (28Vaughan P.S. Aziz F. van Wijnen A.J. Wu S. Harada H. Taniguchi T. Soprano K.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nature. 1995; 377: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).Subsets of myeloid cells require distinct cis elements to direct gp91phox expression in vivo. For example, CGD patients who carry mutations in the gp91phox promoter exhibit normal expression in 5-10% of the lineage (6Woodman R.C. Newburger P.E. Anklesarian P. Erickson R.W. Rae J. Cohen M.S. Curnutte J.T. Blood. 1995; 85: 231-241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Newburger P.E. Skalnik D.G. Hopkins P.J. Eklund E.A. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a CGD patient has been identified in whom gp91phox transcription is restricted to myeloid cells of the eosinophil compartment (50Kuribayashi F. Kumatori A. Suzuki S. Nakamura M. Matsumoto T. Tsuji Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the −450 to +12 bp region of the gp91phox gene directs myeloid-specific expression in transgenic mice, but in only a subset of monocyte/macrophages (4Skalnik D.G. Dorfman D.M. Perkins A.S. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8505-8509Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also found that CP1 binding to a CCAAT-box at −123 to −119 bp is necessary for de-repressed gp91phox promoter activity in HeLa and K562 cells, but not in HEL cells (9Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Variability in promoter element requirements may reflect heterogeneity in the complement of transcription factors present in various cell types. We hypothesize that abundant IRF-2 activity in HEL cells makes CP1 binding dispensable for gp91phox promoter activity, hence providing a molecular mechanism to explain one example of variable cis element requirements for gp91phox promoter activity.Binding of a factor denoted BID to three upstream elements of the gp91phox promoter is required for IFN-γ-induced expression of the gp91phox gene.2 We now describe a fourth BID binding site at approximately −90 bp that directs gp91phox promoter activity in the absence of upstream repressor elements. It is remarkable that both ISRE elements in the gp91phox promoter serve as binding sites for BID and IRF-1/IRF-2. However, the properties of BID do not correspond to those of previously described IFN response factors, and two of the BID binding sites in the gp91phox promoter do not conform to the ISRE consensus sequence.2 Examination of the role of the newly described BID/IRF binding sites in the regulation of the gp91phox promoter in response to IFN and more generally during terminal myeloid cell differentiation is currently under investigation.

These interactions are required for IFN-γ-induced transcription. 2Eklund, E., Luo, W., and Skalnik, D. (1996) J. Immunol., in press. The MID-BID element conforms to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), and is also a binding site for IFN regulatory factors (IRF).2 In addition, the binding of a novel factor, HAF-1 (hematopoietic associated factor-1), to a site at −57 bp is also required for IFN-γ induction of the gp91phox promoter (5Eklund E.A.

None of these transcriptional activating factors are myeloid-specific.The restriction of gp91phox promoter activity to mature phagocytes requires regulated transcriptional repression mediated by the binding of CCAAT displacement protein (CDP). Four CDP binding sites have been detected centered at −350, −220, −150, and −110 bp of the gp91phox promoter. Each CDP binding site overlaps BID or CP1 binding sites, and binding of CDP excludes these transcriptional activating factors (8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol.

Ablation of CDP binding sites results in increased gp91phox promoter activity in HEL, K562, and HeLa cells that do not normally express gp91phox, a phenomenon termed de-repression (8Skalnik D.G.

Transcriptional activating elements within this region of the endogenous gp91phox promoter are presumably interfered with by CDP binding in nonphagocytic cells and are possibly also required for appropriate transcription in mature myeloid cells. The purpose of this study was to identify cis elements and cognate DNA-binding proteins within this promoter region that are required for gp91phox promoter activity. We describe a cis element between −100 and −85 bp of the gp91phox promoter that is required for promoter activity in the absence of repression and which binds members of the IRF family and a factor similar to BID."
https://openalex.org/W2034499790,"Abstract The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (u-PAR) facilitates extracellular matrix proteolysis by accelerating plasmin formation at the cell surface. The present study was undertaken to identify elements in the u-PAR promoter required for the elevated expression of this binding site. Toward this end, we used two cultured colon cancer cell lines; one (RKO) has a transcriptionally activated u-PAR gene, and the other (GEO) overexpresses the receptor only after phorbol ester treatment. A chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter driven by 398 nucleotides of 5′ regulatory sequence of the u-PAR gene was strongly activated in the RKO cells, which displays approximately 3 × 105 receptors/cell. A region of this promoter between −197 and −8 was required for optimal expression, as indicated using a CAT reporter driven by 5′ deleted fragments. DNase I footprinting revealed three protected regions (I, −190 to −171; II, −148 to −124; and III, −99 to −70) in this part of the promoter. Mutation of an AP-1 binding site at −184 within region I reduced activation of the promoter by 85%. Deletion of either region II or III also reduced promoter activity by over 60%. An oligonucleotide spanning the AP-1 motif at −184 bound, specifically, nuclear factors from RKO cells, and antibodies specific for Jun-D, c-Jun, or Fra-1 proteins supershifted the complex indicating the presence of these proteins. The amount of these factors was reduced in GEO cells in which the u-PAR gene is only weakly transcriptionally activated. Expression of a vector encoding a wild-type Jun-D cDNA increased u-PAR promoter activity in GEO cells. Conversely, transfection of RKO cells with a transactivation domain-lacking Jun-D expression construct resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in u-PAR promoter activity. Treatment of GEO cells with phorbol ester increased u-PAR mRNA and the activity of a CAT reporter driven by the wild-type but not the AP-1 (−184)-mutated u-PAR promoter, and this was associated with a strong induction in the amount of Jun-D, c-Jun, and c-Fos. Methylation interference studies using a fragment of the u-PAR promoter (spanning −201 to −150) bound with nuclear extracted proteins from RKO cells, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated and -untreated GEO cells showed that the contact points corresponded to the AP-1 binding site at −184. Thus, the elevated expression of u-PAR in RKO cells, which constitutively produces this binding site, as well as in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated GEO cells requires an AP-1 motif located 184 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site."

MARCKS is largely associated with membranes in cells, and hydrophobic interactions involving the amino-terminal myristoyl moiety are thought to play a role in anchoring MARCKS to cellular membranes. In addition, experiments in cell-free systems have suggested that electrostatic interactions between the positively charged phosphorylation site/calmodulin binding domain (PSD) of MARCKS and negatively charged membrane lipids are also involved in this association. Although it has been inferred from phosphorylation experiments, the electrostatic nature of the interaction between the PSD and membranes has not been demonstrated directly in intact cells. We expressed human MARCKS mutated in the myristoylation site and the PSD in REF52 cells; the cells were then fractionated by ultracentrifugation. Both nonmyristoylatable MARCKS and MARCKS in which the four serines in the PSD were mutated to aspartic acids, mimicking phosphorylation, exhibited decreased membrane affinity when compared to the fully myristoylated, wild-type, tetra-Ser protein or a myristoylated, tetra-Asn mutant. A double mutant, nonmyristoylatable protein in which the four serines in the PSD were mutated to aspartic acids exhibited negligible membrane association. Similar results were obtained in 293 cells that stably expressed chicken MARCKS mutated in the same domains. The double mutant, nonmyristoylatable tetra-Asp chicken protein exhibited little membrane association as determined by both subcellular fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2088000870,"It is well established that TFIIH-dependent transcription by RNA polymerase II requires a hydrolyzable ATP cofactor for synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts. Whether an ATP cofactor is also required after initiation for escape of RNA polymerase II from the promoter has, however, been controversial. We have now addressed this question directly by investigating the ability of RNA polymerase II transcription complexes containing short, ∼5-8-nucleotide transcripts synthesized in the presence of limiting nucleotides to escape the promoter in the absence of an ATP cofactor in a basal transcription system reconstituted with purified RNA polymerase II and general initiation factors. Depletion of ATP had a profound effect on the ability of initiated complexes to progress into the elongation phase: whereas in the presence of ATP, the majority of transcription complexes could be chased away from the promoter-proximal region, most complexes deprived of ATP catalyzed synthesis of only a few phosphodiester bonds and then ceased elongation after synthesizing transcripts less than 10-14 nucleotides in length. A significant fraction of these transcripts could be extended following addition of ATP, indicating that they were contained in arrested, but potentially active elongation complexes. Like the ATP-requiring step in initiation, ATP-dependent suppression of arrest by RNA polymerase II at promoter-proximal sites is inhibited by adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate. Transcription complexes containing transcripts longer than 9-10 nucleotides are insensitive to inhibition by ATPγS, indicating that susceptibility to ATP-sensitive arrest is a property of very early elongation complexes. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel role for an ATP cofactor in transcription by RNA polymerase II."

In this study, we explore another potential mechanism of regulating IL-2 function, one that occurs naturally in vivo. This study is based on our previous observation that alternative splicing is used to generate an inhibitory variant of human IL-4, called IL-4δ2 (34Atamas S.P. Choi J. Yurovsky V.V. White B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 35Alms W.A. Atamas S. Yurovsky V.V. White B. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In IL-4δ2, exon 2 of IL-4 is omitted by alternative splicing. This IL-4 variant has little IL-4 agonistic effects, but inhibits IL-4 costimulation of T cell proliferation, through competitive binding to IL-4 receptors (34Atamas S.P. Choi J. Yurovsky V.V. White B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar). Because of homology between IL-4 and IL-2 proteins and receptors (7Boulay J.-L. Paul W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20525-20528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether alternative splicing was also used to create competitive inhibitors of IL-2. We report that alternative splicing is used to create two variants of IL-2. One variant, called IL-2δ2, omits exon 2. The other variant, IL-2δ3, omits exon 3. Both inhibit IL-2 binding to high affinity IL-2 receptors. Human PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation of heparinized blood samples from healthy adult volunteers. To activate T cells within the PBMC, the PBMC were cultured at 106 cells/ml in 1-ml cultures in complete tissue culture medium containing a final concentration of 1% anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3 hybridoma, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD). Complete tissue culture medium was RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 m HEPES, 2 m -glutamine, 1 m sodium pyruvate, 0.1 m nonessential amino acids, 5 × 10−5 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate. The cultures were incubated for the desired time (6 h to 6 days) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. These activated PMBC were used for RNA isolation, assays of IL-2 costimulation of T cell proliferation, and IL-2 receptor binding studies. Acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62891) Google Scholar) was used to isolate total cellular RNA from PBMC activated with OKT3 monoclonal antibody for 6 h. One μg of RNA was denaturated for 5 min at 65°C with 1 μl of random primers (Life Technologies, Inc.) in sterile H2O in 11-μl total volume. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was done in a 20-μl reaction containing First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 m dithiothreitol, 0.5 m each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, 200 units Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), for 1 h at 37°C. Three μl of this cDNA mixture were subjected to PCR amplification in a 25-μl mixture containing 0.83 units Taq polymerase, PCR Buffer II, 5 m MgCl2 (all from Perkin-Elmer), 0.4 m each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP, and 0.6 m each 3′ and 5′ PCR oligonucleotide primers. The PCR mixture was amplified for 35 cycles, with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55°C for 2 min, and primer extension at 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension at 72°C for 7 min. Two sets of IL-2 primers were used for this PCR amplification. IL-2 primer pair A was exon 1 forward primer 5′-ATG TAC AGG ATG CAA CTC CTG TCT T-3′ and exon 4 reverse primer 5′-GT CAG TGT TGA GAT GAT GCT TTG AC-3′. IL-2 primer pair B was exon 1 forward primer 5′-CCT GCC ACA ATG TAC AGG ATG-3′ and exon 4 reverse primer 5′-TTA TCA AGT CAG TGT TGA GAT-3′. In some experiments, the forward primer was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and 15 units T4 kinase (both from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.), following the manufacturer's protocol. For cloning of IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3, nested PCR was done. The PCR products were first generated with IL-2 primer pair B and then subjected to gel electrophoresis through 1.2% low melting point agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ethidium bromide staining was used to detect the cDNA band corresponding to IL-2 mRNA. The gel was sliced into horizontal sections containing the IL-2 cDNA product and three 0.5-mm wide slices beneath the IL-2 band. To extract cDNA, the gel slices were treated with a GlasPac/GS QuicKit (National Scientific Supply Co., Inc., San Rafael, CA), according to the manufacturer's directions. The cDNAs from each slice were resuspended in sterile H2O. Four μl of the resuspended cDNA were used for a second PCR amplification with IL-2 primer pair C. This IL-2 primer pair was exon 1 forward primer 5′-GAATTC GCA CCT ACT TCA AGT TCT ACA-3′ and exon 4 reverse primer 5′-GCGGCCGC TTA AGT CAG TGT TGA GAT GAT GCT-3′. The underlined nucleotides encode a EcoRI restriction site (forward primer) and a NotI restriction site (reverse primer). The PCR mixture was amplified for 35 cycles, with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, primer annealing at 55°C for 2 min, and primer extension at 72°C for 3 min, with final extension at 72°C for 7 min. RT-PCR amplification products generated with IL-2 primer pair A were size-separated by gel electrophoresis in 2.5% agarose. The gels were soaked sequentially in denaturation solution (1.5 NaCl, 0.5 NaOH) and neutralization solution (1.5 NaCl, 1 Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) for 30 min each. The RT-PCR amplification products were next transferred to nylon membranes by blotting overnight in 20 × standard saline citrate (SSC) buffer. The DNA samples were cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet light irradiation. Membranes were prehybridized in 6 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 50 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 42°C. The membrane was hybridized overnight with 0.2 μg of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe at 49°C in 6 × SSC and 1% SDS. The oligonucleotide probe for the IL-2 exon 1-exon 3 junction was 5′-GGA ATT AAT GCC ACA GAA C-3′. This probe was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, using a random primer labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The membrane was washed three times in 6 × SSC and 1% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, followed by a final wash at 49°C for 20 min. The membrane was subjected to autoradiography. IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 RT-PCR amplification products were generated by nested PCR with IL-2 primer pairs B and C. These products were cloned individually into the pCR™II vector (Invitrogen Corp.), according to the manufacturer's directions. The IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 inserts were separated from the pCR™II vector by digestion of the plasmid DNA with EcoRI and NotI restriction enzymes (Life Technologies, Inc.). The digested DNA was subjected to gel electrophoresis through 1.2% low melting point agarose, and cDNAs were isolated from gel slices using GlasPac/GS QuicKit. After ethanol precipitation, the IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 cDNAs were ligated overnight with T4 DNA ligase into the pPIC9 plasmid (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer's directions. Ligated pPIC9-IL-2, pPIC9-IL-2δ2, and pPIC9-IL-2δ3 plasmids were purified by electrophoresis through low melting point agarose, treatment with GlasPac/GS QuicKit, and ethanol precipitation. The DNA sequences of the IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 inserts in pPIC9 were determined using the Sequenase v.2.0 DNA sequencing kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's directions. The pPIC9 plasmids containing IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 were used individually to transform the protease-deficient strain SMD1168 of Pichia pastoris yeast (Invitrogen Corp.), according to the manufacturer's directions. Several transformed Mut+ or Muts transformed P. pastoris clones were identified and selected. To confirm that IL-2, IL-2δ2, or IL-2δ3 cDNAs had integrated into the Pichia genome, DNA was isolated from transformed clones using Easy-DNA™ kit (Invitrogen Corp.). Amplification by PCR of IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 DNAs was done with the 5′ and 3′AOX1 primers included in the Easy-DNA™ kit, according to the manufacturer's directions. Amplification of DNAs of the expected size confirmed integration of the IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 DNAs into the Pichia genome. Protein expression was induced by culturing the transformed yeast in medium containing 1% methanol for 24 h at 30°C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein expression by several transformed Mut+ and Muts P. pastoris clones was compared to identify clones producing high levels of IL-2, IL-2δ2, or IL-2δ3 protein. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 50 μl of yeast supernatant were denaturated by heating at 100°C for 10 min, loaded onto a precast 10-20% gradient gel (Bio-Rad), and subjected to electrophoresis in Laemmli buffer. These gels were stained using a silver stain kit (Sigma) or transblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) at 90 V and 0.25 A for 4 h. Membranes were subjected to Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-2 antibody (Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA) at a 1:4000 dilution and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Life Sciences were used for membrane blocking, washing, and development. Concentration and partial purification of rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, and rhIL-2δ3 was done. For each protein, 1 liter of yeast supernatant was concentrated to 50 ml by filtration through Ultrasette 3K filter (Filtron Technology Corp., Northborough, MA). The concentrated IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 preparations were diluted with 1 liter of 0.15 phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. These preparations were again concentrated 20-fold through Ultrasette 3K filters to exchange buffers, followed by filtration through 200 K OMEGA membranes (Filtron Technology Corp.) to remove unwanted macromolecules. One liter of supernatant from P. pastoris strain transformed with pPIC9 plasmid containing cDNA for human serum albumin (Invitrogen Corp.) was induced, concentrated, and partially purified in an identical manner, for use as a negative control. The amounts of rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, and rhIL-2δ3 in each preparation, relative to commercial rhIL-2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), were estimated by quantitative immunoblotting. Prior to use of the rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, rhIL-2δ3, and recombinant human serum albumin in any cell proliferation assay, preparations were dialyzed extensively against RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium. PBMC were isolated and stimulated with OKT3 monoclonal antibody, as described above. After 6 days, the mononuclear cells were washed twice and resuspended in complete tissue culture medium without OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The cells were cultured at 105 cells per 100-μl culture in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon/Becton-Dickinson Labware, Oxnard, CA) in complete tissue culture medium alone, or with rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, or rhIL-2δ3 alone, or with rhIL-2 in combination with rhIL-2δ2 or rhIL-2δ3. Cultures were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. After 3 days, the cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (DuPont NEN), incubated overnight, and then harvested with a 1295 Cell Harvester (LKB-Wallac, Turku, Finland). Tritiated thymidine incorporation was measured with a 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (LKB-Wallac). The mean ± standard deviation (S.D.) of cpm of quadruplicate cultures was determined. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer. PBMC were induced to express high affinity IL-2 receptors by stimulation with OKT3 monoclonal antibody for 6 days (37Lowenthal J.W. Malek T.R. Saragovi H. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 6.1.1Google Scholar). The activated mononuclear cells were washed once with RPMI 1640, pH 3, at 4°C to remove endogenously produced IL-2 that was bound to IL-2 receptors on the cell surface (37Lowenthal J.W. Malek T.R. Saragovi H. Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulies D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 6.1.1Google Scholar). The cells were then washed and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in 1-ml cultures in complete tissue culture medium. To measure IL-2 binding to these cells, 10 p 125I-IL-2 (DuPont NEN) was added to cultures alone or in combination with serial dilutions of unlabeled rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, or rhIL-2δ3. The unlabeled rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, and rhIL-2δ3 were always added 5 min before the 125I-IL-2. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with gentle shaking on a platform shaker. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice in 5 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 4°C, and transferred to a clean tube. Bound 125I-IL-2 was measured using a 1272 CliniGamma automatic γ counter (LKB-Wallac). Nonspecific binding, defined as residual cpm of cells incubated with 125I-IL-2 in the presence of 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled rhIL-2, was subtracted from all data points to determine the amount of specific binding. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of the cpm of specifically bound 125I-IL-2 in quadruplicate cultures. We had previously identified an inhibitory variant of IL-4 in which exon 2 is omitted by alternative splicing (34Atamas S.P. Choi J. Yurovsky V.V. White B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 435-441PubMed Google Scholar, 35Alms W.A. Atamas S. Yurovsky V.V. White B. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Because IL-4 and IL-2 are members of the same multigene family, we examined IL-2 mRNA to determine whether alternative splicing was also used to produce a variant that is missing exon 2. Total RNA was isolated from human PBMC that were stimulated for 6 h with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The RNA was subjected to RT-PCR amplification using IL-2 PCR primer pair A. Two RT-PCR amplification products were identified for IL-2 (Fig. 1A). The size of the larger amplification product was estimated at 458 bp, which corresponded to the size of native IL-2 cDNA (38Fujita T. Takaoka C. Matsui H. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39Taniguchi T. Matsui J. Fujita T. Takaoka C. Kashima N. Yoshimoto R. Hamuro J. Nature. 1983; 302: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The size of the smaller amplification product was estimated at 398 bp, the predicted size of an alternatively spliced variant of IL-2 lacking exon 2. This product was named IL-2δ2. To further test for the presence of an alternative splice variant that omitted exon 2, IL-2 RT-PCR products were size-separated by gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with an IL-2 exon 1-exon 3 junction probe (Fig. 1B). Two bands were detected with this probe. The 458-bp product represents native IL-2 cDNA, whereas the 398-bp band represents IL-2δ2 cDNA. The probe preferentially hybridized to IL-2δ2 rather than complete IL-2 cDNA (Fig. 1B). To further identify alternative splice variants of IL-2, total cellular RNA was extracted from human PBMC stimulated for 6 h with OKT3 monoclonal antibody. The RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using IL-2 primer pair B. The amplification products were subjected to gel electrophoresis in low melting point agarose. An amplification product of the predicted size of IL-2 mRNA was visualized using ethidium bromide staining. The agarose gel containing the IL-2 amplification product and the gel underneath were sliced into four 0.5-mm horizontal slices. DNA was extracted from each slice and subjected to a second round of PCR with IL-2 primer pair C. The amplification products were again size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide staining (Fig. 2). In addition to the expected IL-2 amplification product of 416 bp (Fig. 2, lanes 3-6), an amplification product of 356 bp was seen (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6), corresponding to the IL-2δ2 PCR product identified in Fig. 1. Unexpectedly, a third PCR product of 272 bp was seen (Fig. 2, lane 4). This product, which had the expected size of an alternative splice variant that was missing exon 3 (38Fujita T. Takaoka C. Matsui H. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), was named IL-2δ3. The IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 cDNAs were cloned into pPIC9 plasmid and their DNA sequence determined. The IL-2δ2 cDNA sequence consisted of IL-2 exons 1, 3, and 4, with exon 1 spliced directly to exon 3 without frameshift or nucleotide errors (Fig. 3, first panel). Sequence analysis of IL-2δ3 cDNA showed IL-2 exons 1, 2, and 4, with exon 2 spliced directly to exon 4 without frameshift or nucleotide error (Fig. 3, third panel). Sequence analysis of IL-2 cDNA isolated, cloned, and sequenced in parallel with IL-2δ2 and IL-2δ3 cDNAs demonstrated the expected presence of exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 3, 2nd and 4th panels). Recombinant human IL-2, rhIL-2δ2, and rhIL-2δ3 in pPIC9 plasmids were used individually to transform P. pastoris yeast strain SMD1168. Expression of each protein was induced by culturing a transformed P. pastoris clone in 1% methanol. Yeast supernatants were prepared as described above and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through a 10-20% gradient gel (Fig. 4A). Silver staining of the gel showed single bands of proteins of the expected sizes, with IL-2 approximately 15 kDa, IL-2δ2 approximately 13 kDa, and IL-2δ3 approximately 10 kDa (Fig. 4A, lanes 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Few other proteins were in these yeast supernatants, because P. pastoris secretes few proteins of its own (40Barr K.A. Hopkins S.A. Sreekrishna K. Pharm. Eng. 1992; 12: 48-52Google Scholar). The yeast supernatants were also subjected to Western immunoblotting analysis with polyclonal rabbit anti-human IL-2 antibody. The IL-2, IL-2δ2, and IL-2δ3 proteins were all recognized by this antibody (Fig. 4B). IL-2 is a potent costimulator of T cell proliferation (1Morgan D.A. Ruscetti F.W. Gallo R. Science. 1976; 193: 1007-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 2Gillis S. Ferm M.M. Ou W. Smith K.J. J. Immunol. 1978; 120: 2027-2032PubMed Google Scholar, 8Howard M.C. Miyajima A. Coffman R. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press Ltd., New York1993: 766Google Scholar). Experiments were designed to determine whether IL-2δ2 and IL-2δ3 had similar functional effects. Commercial rhIL-2 made in Escherichia coli (Life Technologies, Inc.) and our rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, and rhIL-2δ3 preparations were tested for ability to costimulate proliferation of activated human PBMC. The PBMC were stimulated for 6 days with 1% OKT3 monoclonal antibody to activate T cells and then washed twice. These cells were cultured for 3 days in complete tissue culture medium alone, with commercial rhIL-2, or with rhIL-2, rhIL-2δ2, or rhIL-2δ3. [3H]Thymidine was added during the last 12 h of culture. Commercial rhIL-2 and our rhIL-2 stimulated similar degrees of proliferation (Fig. 5). In contrast, rhIL-2δ2 and rhIL-2δ3 did not stimulate proliferation at similar concentrations (Fig. 5) or even at higher concentrations up to 500 p (data not shown). Next, studies were done to test whether rhIL-2δ2 or rhIL-2δ3 could inhibit IL-2 costimulation of T cell proliferation. Again, PBMC were stimulated for 6 days with 1% OKT3 monoclonal antibody to activate T cells and washed twice. The cells were cultured in complete tissue culture medium alone, with 1 or 5 ng/ml (0.06 or 0.3 p) rhIL-2 alone, or in combination with titrated doses of rhIL-2δ2 or rhIL-2δ3. These doses of rhIL-2 were chosen based upon preliminary experiments that showed they stimulated proliferation within the linear portion of the dose-response curve. Recombinant human serum albumin prepared in an identical manner was used as a negative control. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was measured after 72 h of culture. As expected, rhIL-2 costimulated T cell proliferation. However, in a dose-dependent manner, both rhIL-2δ2 and rhIL-2δ3 inhibited the ability of IL-2 to cause T cell proliferation (Fig. 6). Human serum albumin prepared in an identical manner had no effect (Fig. 6). Similar inhibitory effects of rhIL-2δ2 and rhIL-2δ3 were seen in four of four independent experiments. The observed inhibition of IL-2 costimulation could have been caused by nonspecific toxic effects of the rhIL-2δ2 and rhIL-2δ3 preparations, despite dialysis against and dilution in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium before use. This seemed less likely because identical amounts of P. pastoris supernatant containing h"
https://openalex.org/W2061607157,"Regulation of mRNA levels, DNA binding activities, and phosphorylation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family members by stimulation of glutamate receptors were studied in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies to C/EBP family members revealed that both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ but not C/EBPα are expressed in the nuclei of astrocytes. After exposure to glutamate, C/EBPβ mRNA levels increased within 10 min, reached the maximal level at about 1 h, and returned to the basal level within 6 h. In contrast, C/EBPδ mRNA levels decreased by 6 h and were recovered within 12 h. These changes in mRNA levels were accompanied by an increase and a decrease in proteins for C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, respectively. Elevation of C/EBPβ mRNA levels by glutamate treatment required an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and depended on activations of protein kinase C and calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. Gel mobility shift analysis using nuclear extracts from the glutamate-treated cells showed increases in C/EBP site binding activities 2 h after the exposure to glutamate. Moreover, glutamate stimulated phosphorylation of C/EBPβ in 32P-labeled astrocytes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These results suggest that glutamate regulates functions of C/EBP family members in brain astrocytes through changes in mRNA levels of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ as well as through phosphorylation of C/EBPβ.

Stimulation of glutamate receptors induces expression of prototypic immediate early genes such as c-fos in cultured neurons (Cole et al., 12Cole A.J. Saffen D.W. Baraban J.M. Worley P.F.

In in vitro experiments with cultured astrocytes, Fos and Jun family members are induced following stimulation of the glutamate receptors (Condorelli et al., 13Condorelli D.F. Albani P.D. Amico C.

We have long been studying the roles of CaM kinase II in neuronal functions, especially in hippocampal LTP which is related to the activation of glutamate receptors. The long lasting activation of this kinase was observed where glutamate receptors in the cultured neurons were stimulated (Fukunaga and Soderling, 19Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1990; 1: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; Fukunaga et al., 21Fukunaga K. Soderling T.R. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22527-22533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This also occurred in brain astrocytes (Yano et al., 57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the long lasting increased activity of the enzyme was associated with LTP induction in hippocampal slices (Fukunaga et al., 22Fukunaga K. Stoppini L. Miyamoto E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7863-7867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In LTP, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ through the N-methyl–aspartate receptor triggered increased CaM kinase II activity and resulted in phosphorylation of synaptic elements, synapsin I in presynaptic sites, and microtubule-associated protein 2 (Fukunaga et al., 23Fukunaga K. Muller D. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6119-6124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and possibly the AMPA receptor in postsynaptic sites (Tan et al., 50Tan S.-E. Wenthold R.J. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1123-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may in turn elicit the stable LTP. Furthermore, accumulating evidence has suggested that CaM kinase II is involved in Ca2+ stimulation of gene expression through activation of transcription factors in the hippocampus and PC12 cells (Kapiloff et al., 26Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar; Bading et al., 7Bading H. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional regulation by CaM kinase II may be related to production of stable LTP in the hippocampal neurons. Among the putative candidates of transcription factors which bind to the Ca2+-responsive element are cAMP-responsive element-binding proteins (CREB) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP). Members of CREB family activate the transcription of genes with cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sequence in response to increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP and Ca2+. Indeed, the in vitro transcription from the CRE-containing c-fos promoter is stimulated when Ser-133 of CREB is phosphorylated either by CaM kinase II or by cAMP kinase (Dash et al., 14Dash P.K. Karl K.A. Colicos M.A. Prywes R. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5061-5065Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The existence and function of C/EBP family in the brain are poorly understood. The C/EBP family members are transcription factors belonging to a class of basic region-leucine zipper proteins (Vinson et al., 53Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L.

Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The C/EBP family consists of at least six members, including C/EBPα (Landschulz et al., 32Landschulz W.H.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ is regulated by phosphorylation. Ser-105 within the activation domain of C/EBPβ is phosphorylated in response to PKC activation (Trautwein et al., 51Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and Ser-276 within the leucine zipper by CaM kinase II (Wegner et al., 54Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of each site enhances its transcriptional efficacy. The function of C/EBPβ is also modulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (Nakajima et al., 36Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 207-211Google Scholar). Interestingly, a homologue of C/EBPβ was reported to be involved in consolidation of stable long term synaptic plasticity in Aplysia neurons (Alberini et al., 4Alberini C.M. Ghirardi M. Metz R. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 1099-1114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We reported that stimulation of glutamate receptors activated CaM kinase II with phosphorylation of vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein in cultured rat cortical astrocytes (Yano et al., 57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the astrocytes, CaM kinase II was found to be exclusively localized in nuclei, and the enzyme is probably involved in the Ca2+-responsive gene expression. In the present study, we found that both C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are predominantly distributed in nuclei of astrocytes and that C/EBPβ mRNA rapidly increases, while C/EBPδ mRNA decreases, when glutamate receptors are stimulated. Evidence is provided that activation of both PKC and CaM-dependent protein kinases are likely to be involved in the glutamate-mediated C/EBPβ mRNA induction. The phosphorylation of C/EBPβ also increased when glutamate receptors were stimulated.

The antisera against C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were kindly provided by Prof. S. L. McKnight (Tularik Incorporated). Isolation of genes for C/EBP family members were prepared as described previously (Nishiyori et al., 37Nishiyori A. Tashiro H. Kimura A. Akagi K. Yamamura K. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1323-1331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat liver cDNA for GAPDH (nucleotides 238-1042) was prepared by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedure, and cloned into the EcoRV site of the plasmid pcDNAII (Invitrogen). The affinity-purified polyclonal antibody against brain CaM kinase II was prepared as described previously (Fukunaga et al., 20Fukunaga K. Goto S. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1070-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cultured astrocytes were prepared from the neocortex of 1-day-old Wistar rats as described by Yano et al. (57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultured cells were maintained at 37°C in 45% Eagle's minimum essential medium (Nissui), 45% Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10% fetal calf serum, 10 m glutamine, and 7.5% NaHCO3, in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere for 1 week and then subcultured on plastic culture dishes coated with poly -lysine at a density of 3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Cultured astrocytes were grown to confluency and incubated with the serum-free medium for 24 h. The dishes were washed twice with Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) which contained 128 m NaCl, 5 m KCl, 1 m NaHPO4, 1.2 m MgSO4, 2.7 m CaCl2, 10 m glucose, and 20 m HEPES (pH 7.4). After incubation with KRH for 15 min, the cultured astrocytes were incubated at 37°C for the indicated times without (control) or with the specific test agents, then the cells were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and harvested for use in further experiments. Total RNA was extracted from cultured astrocytes, according to the procedure of Chomczynski and Sacchi (11Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63166) Google Scholar). Then, 4 μg of each RNA sample were denatured at 55°C for 15 min in 45% formamide and 5.4% formaldehyde, and electrophoresed at room temperature in 2.2 formaldehyde, 1% agarose gel. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide to confirm equal loading of RNA samples by visualizing 28 and 18 S ribosomal bands. Following transfer to nylon membranes, blots were baked at 80°C for 2 h and prehybridized and hybridized with each of the labeled cDNA probes (2 × 107 dpm/ml) in a hybridization solution containing 50% formamide, 0.1% Ficoll 400, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% BSA, 0.75 NaCl, 50 m NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 5 m EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. Blots were washed three times for 10 min each at room temperature, twice with 2 × saline-sodium citrate (SSC; 1 × SSC: 0.15 NaCl, 0.015 sodium citrate) plus 0.1% SDS, washed twice with SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C for 30 min, and then exposed to an imaging plate or x-ray films at −80°C. Radioactivity was then analyzed using a Bio-Image analyzer BA100 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Japan). The same filter was rehybridized with a different cDNA after stripping of radioactivity with the hybridization solution for 1 h at 70°C. The rehybridization with digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe for GAPDH was performed according to instructions of Boehringer Mannheim (Germany). Nuclear extracts from cultured astrocytes were prepared as described by Schreiber et al. (46Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). The probe used in gel-shift assays was the double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the CaM kinase II-responsive element (CaMRE) of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter (Kapiloff et al., 26Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Rous sarcoma virus nucleotides −231 to −193; 5′-AAATGTAGTCTTATGCAATACACTTGTAGTCTTGCAACA-3′). The sequence coincides with the binding sites for C/EBP as described by Wegner et al. (54Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The 5′ ends of probe DNAs were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The standard binding reaction was carried out in 10 μl of a mixture containing 25 m HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 m KCl, 1 m EDTA, 0.5 m spermidine, 0.6 m dithiothreitol, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 fmol of the 32P-labeled probe (about 2 × 104 dpm), and nuclear extracts (3-4 μg of protein). In competition analysis, 1 pmol of the competitor oligonucleotide was mixed before the addition of nuclear extracts. After 30 min on ice, 2.5 μl of 20% Ficoll were added, and the samples were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel made in a buffer containing 89 m Tris, 89 m boric acid, and 2.5 m EDTA. Electrophoresis was performed at 10 V/cm for 2 h at room temperature. The gel was then dried and autoradiographed on x-ray films at −80°C. For antibody double shift analysis, 1 μl of the antiserum diluted 100-fold in 3% BSA was added to mixtures of the binding reaction, after a 15-min incubation. Immunofluorescence analysis of cultured astrocytes was carried out as described previously (Yano et al., 57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, the cells on a coverslip were fixed at 37°C in 3.7% formaldehyde in TBS, washed in TBS, and permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 in TBS for 10 min. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by preincubation with 2.5% BSA in TBS (blocking solution) for 30 min. Each antibody to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ was diluted 1:200 in the blocking solution. Cells were incubated at 4°C with the primary antibody overnight, then washed in TBS and incubated in fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min. After three 5-min washes, the coverslips were mounted in TBS containing 50% (v/v) glycerol. Cells were observed and photographed using a Nikon Optiphoto microscope (Nikon) equipped with an EF illumination system and a 50-W mercury lamp (Osram). Images were recorded on Kodak Tri-X film. Negative controls were immunostained with nonimmune rabbit IgG. The harvested astrocytes were collected from two sets of 100-mm dishes by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min and solubilized with 30 μl of a buffer containing 10 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 m KCl, 0.1 m EGTA, 0.1 m EDTA, 1 m dithiothreitol, and 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots were examined for protein concentration, and the same amount of proteins was subjected for SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) in 13.5% acrylamide and assayed by immunoblot analysis, as described by Yano et al. (57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ antibodies were each diluted 1:200. Immunoreactive peptides were detected using 125I-labeled protein A. Labeling of cultured astrocytes was carried out with [32P]orthophosphate (0.25 mCi/ml) for 5 h in 35-mm dishes, as described by Yano et al. (57Yano S. Fukunaga K. Ushio Y. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5428-5439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To eliminate the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ by PKC, the astrocytes were pretreated with 100 n PMA for 13 h before labeling, after which the glutamate-induced phosphorylation of CaM kinase II and C/EBPβ was examined. Stimulation of cells was terminated by aspiration of the medium, and the cells were immediately frozen in liquid N2. These frozen astrocytes were scraped from the dishes and solubilized at 0°C in 0.3 ml of a buffer containing 10 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 m KCl, 0.1 m EGTA, 0.1 m EDTA, 1 m dithiothreitol, 1 m Na3VO4, 30 m sodium pyrophosphate, 50 m NaF, and 0.5 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. All procedures for treatment of these cells were carried out at 0-4°C. After centrifugation of the homogenate, the insoluble materials were subjected to purification of the nuclear extracts, according to the method of Schreiber et al. (46Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). The Triton X-100-soluble fractions and nuclear extracts were mixed, SDS was added at a final concentration of 0.1%, and the preparation was subjected to immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled CaM kinase II. Fractions containing the same amount of proteins were incubated at 4°C for 4 h with the anti-CaM kinase II antibody (5 μg) and 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B suspension (50% v/v). The immunocomplex immobilized on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was washed three times with a solubilization solution containing 50 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 m EDTA, 1 m Na3VO4, 30 m sodium pyrophosphate, 50 m NaF, and 0.1% SDS. After the immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled CaM kinase II, the extracts were further subjected to immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled C/EBPβ, using the anti-C/EBPβ antibody (5 μg) and 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. After washing in the solubilization solution, these immunoprecipitates were eluted from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B by treatment with the SDS sample buffer (Laemmli, 30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) and boiled for 4 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. A Bio-Image analyzer (BA100, Fuji Film) was used to quantify the amount of 32P-incorporation into CaM kinase II subunits and C/EBPβ. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (8Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 226: 203-221Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. values. The significance of the difference was calculated by Student's t test, and values of <0.05 were considered to have statistical significance. In initial experiments, indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the existence and distribution of C/EBP family members in cultured rat cortical astrocytes. Fig. 1 shows phase-contrast and immunofluorescence micrographs using the antibody to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ. Immunofluorescence with the anti-C/EBPβ antibody was strong in the nucleus and weak in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, C and D). Likewise, strong immunostaining with the anti-C/EBPδ antibody was observed in and around the nuclei and immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm was relatively weak (Fig. 1, E and F). Immunofluorescence was not evident in case of treatment with the anti-C/EBPα antibody (Fig. 1, A and B), nor was it detected using nonimmune rabbit IgG and the preabsorbed antiserum with C/EBPβ protein expressed as a fusion with maltose-binding protein (data not shown). Existence of the C/EBP family was further confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). Major and minor immunoreactive bands of 33 and 35 kDa, respectively, were observed in the cultured astrocytes as well as in the nuclear extract from rat liver, using the anti-C/EBPβ antibody. On the other hand, one major immunoreactive band of 33 kDa was detected in the astrocytes using the anti-C/EBPδ antibody, but was not evident in the rat liver nuclear extract. C/EBPα recognized with the anti-C/EBPα antibody was not detected in astrocytes, whereas strong immunoreactive proteins of 31-43 kDa were observed in the nuclear extract from rat liver.Fig. 2Immunoblot analysis of C/EBP family members in cultured astrocytes. Cultured astrocytes were incubated with the serum-free medium for 24 h before treatment. After incubation with KRH for 15 min at 37°C, the medium was aspirated and washed twice with TBS. The whole-cell extracts were prepared and the same amounts of protein (30 μg/lane) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the antibody to C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, or C/EBPδ (diluted 1:200) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thirty μg of nuclear extracts prepared from adult rat liver were used as a positive control. A, whole-cell extracts from astrocytes; L, nuclear extracts from adult rat liver. The positions of molecular weight standards are indicated at the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined effects of glutamate on regulation of mRNA levels of C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ in cultured astrocytes. The culture medium was replaced by the serum-free medium 24 h before the glutamate treatment, then the cultured astrocytes were incubated with 500 μ glutamate for the indicated times. After preparation of the total RNA from the astrocytes, RNA blot analysis using 32P-labeled cDNA probes for each C/EBP family member was performed. Representative autoradiograms are presented in Fig. 3A. To evaluate the total amount of RNA analyzed, the filter was rehybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe for GAPDH mRNA. The mRNA levels of C/EBPβ significantly increased 10 min after exposure to glutamate, reached the maximal level at 60 mi"

Investigation of signal transduction mechanisms associated with tensin revealed the presence of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity in tensin immunoprecipitates from platelet-derived growth factor-treated cells. Association of PI 3-kinase activity with tensin was transitory, and the amount of activity was approximately 1% of the total PI 3-kinase activity found in anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-pY) immunoprecipitates. In vitro, PI 3-kinase activity associated with the SH2 domain of tensin in a platelet-derived growth factor-dependent manner. The optimal phosphopeptide binding specificity of the SH2 domain of tensin was determined to be phospho-Y (E or D), N, (I, V, or F). Synthetic phosphopeptides containing the sequence YENI could specifically block the association of PI 3-kinase activity with tensin in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase interacts with the cytoskeleton via the SH2 domain of tensin and may play an important role in platelet-derived growth factor-induced cytoskeletal reorganization that is concomitant with cell migration and proliferation.

The extracellular matrix plays an important role in many cellular activities, including growth, differentiation, migration, and metastasis (1Burridge K. Fath K.

Bioessays. 1989; 10: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Integrins, which are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, form a bridge at focal adhesions between the extracellular matrix and the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton (5Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9022) Google Scholar). Other proteins found localized in focal adhesions include structural proteins (e.g. vinculin), proteins with known enzymatic activity (e.g. focal adhesion kinase, FAK), 1The abbreviations used are: FAKfocal adhesion kinasePDGFplatelet-derived growth factorGSTglutathione S-transferaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPtdInsphosphatidylinositolPtdIns-4-Pphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePtdIns-4,5-P2phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphatePtdInsP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatePI 3-kinasephosphoinositide 3-hydroxy kinase. and proteins with diverse functions, such as tensin. focal adhesion kinase platelet-derived growth factor glutathione S-transferase high performance liquid chromatography phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphoinositide 3-hydroxy kinase. Of the proteins which interact with actin at focal adhesions, tensin is thought to be located closest to the ends of actin filaments because of its F-actin-binding and capping activities (6Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tensin has sequence similarity to actin-binding proteins (7Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S.

The presence of these characteristics in a single molecule suggests that tensin might coordinate signals involved in cytoskeletal changes. One important signal transduction cascade stimulated by receptor protein-tyrosine kinases is the phosphatidylinositol pathway. The classical phosphatidylinositol pathway is involved in two regulatory processes. Phospholipase C cleaves phosphoinositides to yield second messengers important for cell proliferation (10Bansal V.S. Majerus P.W. Annu. Rev.

PI 3-kinase has also been implicated in actin-based cytoskeletal rearrangement. Deletion of the kinase insert domain that contains the binding site for PI 3-kinase from the PDGF receptor eliminates the ability of PDGF to mediate actin reorganization (25Severinsson L. Ek B. Mellstrom K. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 801-809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, PI 3-kinase is an important mediator of PDGF-induced membrane ruffling (26Wennstrom S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson W.L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) and PDGF-induced chemotaxis (27Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). PDGF-induced membrane ruffling and chemotaxis can be prevented if the PI 3-kinase binding site on the PDGF receptor is deleted or if PI 3-kinase activity is inhibited by the fungal metabolite wortmannin. The regulatory 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase is recruited to beads coated with fibronectin that induce the formation of focal adhesion complexes (29Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K.

Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3806-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the translocation of PI 3-kinase and p60c-src to the cytoskeleton (32Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4686-4692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase and p60c-src are also recruited to the cytoskeleton by the platelet adhesion receptor glycoprotein Ib/IX when activated by von Willebrand factor (34Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Rabinowitz I. Salem H.H. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27093-27099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies have also demonstrated an interaction between PI 3-kinase and FAK (35Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). FAK is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase in the signal transduction cascade downstream of integrin (36Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Therefore, PI 3-kinase plays a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements elicited by both mitogenic and nonmitogenic stimuli. In this paper we present evidence that tensin can form complexes with phosphoinositide kinase activities. In addition, PI 3-kinase can specifically form complexes in tensin immunoprecipitates in a PDGF-dependent manner. We further investigate the interaction of PI 3-kinase and tensin with a GST-tensin SH2 domain construct and find that PDGF stimulation is required for association of PI 3-kinase and tensin in vitro. The optimal phosphopeptide recognition specificity for the SH2 domain of tensin is p-Y(E or D)N(I, V, or F). Results of competition experiments with a synthetic peptide containing the sequence pYENI suggest that a complex containing PI 3-kinase interacts specifically with the SH2 domain of tensin. These data suggest that PI 3-kinase is involved in focal adhesion dynamics in response to growth factor stimulation, cellular signaling, and cytoskeletal rearrangement. The full-length tensin clone was derived from chicken cardiac muscle and transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (7Lo S.H. An Q. Bao S. Wong W.-K. Liu Y. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22310-22319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This transfected cell line (designated L-1) was propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum and 300 μg/ml G418. NIH 3T3, human foreskin fibroblasts (FS-2), and Balb/c 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% CS. Cells grown on 10-cm dishes were lysed in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 m Hepes, 135 m NaCl, 5 m EDTA, 10% glycerol, 500 μ vanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and were incubated on a platform rocker at 4°C for 5-10 min. Plates were scrape-harvested, and the lysates were triturated, collected into Eppendorf tubes, and vortexed. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The appropriate antibody was added and incubated at 4°C on a rocker platform for 2 h. Protein A-Sepharose (50% suspension in phosphate-buffered saline) was added and the incubation was continued for 1 h. For GST-tensin SH2 domain association, 35 μl of purified GST-fusion protein on Sepharose beads in a 50% suspension of phosphate-buffered saline was added in place of the antibody and incubated on a rocker platform at 4°C for 1 h. The tensin SH2 domain was constructed as previously reported (8Davis S. Lu M.L. Lo S.H. Lin S. Butler J.A. Druker B.J. Roberts T.M. An Q. Chen L.B. Science. 1991; 252: 712-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and used without modification. All complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 m EDTA, and 100 μ vanadate in phosphate-buffered saline; once with 0.5 LiCl and 100 μ vanadate in 100 m Tris (pH 7.25); and once with 100 m NaCl and 1 m EDTA in 10 m Tris (pH 7.25). PI 3-kinase assays were performed as described previously (37Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 50 μl. Briefly, 10 μl of sonicated lipid mix was added to the washed beads (see above) followed by 35 μl of ATP mix to initiate the reaction (final concentrations: 20 m Hepes, 5 m MgCl2, 20 μ ATP, 20 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol)). Reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and were stopped with 75 μl of 1 HCl and 180 μl of methanol/chloroform (1:1). This length of time and ATP concentration was determined to be in the linear range of the assay. Samples were vortexed and then centrifuged to separate the organic and aqueous phases. Seventy-five μl of the organic phase was collected and analyzed by TLC on Silica Gel 60 plates precoated with potassium oxalate in an n-propanol:2 acetic acid (65:35, v/v) solvent system. The radioactivity was visualized and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The specific activity of the reaction was increased for samples to be analyzed by HPLC. The samples were deacylated with methylamine reagent (10.7% methylamine, 45.7% methanol, 11.4% n-butanol, 32.2% water) directly on the TLC plate as described previously (38Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 159Google Scholar). The dried deacylated samples were resuspended in distilled water and analyzed by ion-exchange HPLC. Radioactivity was detected with a Radiomatic Flow-One-β flow-through detector (Packard Instrument Co.) immediately after the anion-exchange column. To determine whether tensin is involved with phosphatidylinositol signal transduction cascades, we tested for the presence of phosphoinositide kinase activity in tensin immunoprecipitates. In addition, the effect of PDGF stimulation on phosphoinositide kinase activities in tensin immunoprecipitates was determined. L-1 cells (NIH cells expressing chicken tensin) were grown to confluence and placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% CS overnight. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with PDGF-BB for 15 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antiserum made against chicken tensin (Ø72). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, phosphoinositide kinase activity is present in unstimulated cells and increases after PDGF stimulation of the cells. Elevated PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P kinase activities are present in immunoprecipitates of tensin from unstimulated cells compared to the preimmune serum (Fig. 1A, compare lane 1 versus lane 3). Lipid kinase assays done on antitensin immunoprecipitates from control NIH 3T3 cells not expressing chicken tensin showed no increase in PI 3-kinase activity after PDGF-BB stimulation (data not shown). The production of PtdInsP3 in the PDGF-stimulated condition indicates PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 1A, lane 4). A time course of PDGF stimulation revealed a transient association of PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1B) that has kinetics similar to an anti-pY immunoprecipitate from PDGF-stimulated cells (data not shown) (37Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Peak activity occurs at 15 min, and the activity in stimulated cells is approximately 4 times greater than in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1B). The PI 3-kinase activity found in tensin immunoprecipitates represented approximately 1% of the PI 3-kinase activity recovered in anti-pY immunoprecipitations after 15 min of PDGF stimulation (data not shown and Fig. 2). The amount of tensin in the immunoprecipitate did not increase with PDGF stimulation as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). In addition, treatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin decreased the amount of PI 3-kinase activity in tensin immunoprecipitates by 71% (data not shown).Fig. 2Phosphoinositide kinase activity in tensin immunoprecipitates (R95) from PDGF-BB-stimulated human FS-2 fibroblasts. Cells were treated for 0, 5, 15, 45, or 90 min with PDGF-BB and then immunoprecipitated for the lipid kinase assay. The last two lanes on the right were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) as a comparison. The reaction products from an assay using PtdIns and PtdInsP2 as substrates were extracted and analyzed by TLC and exposed to a PhosphorImager cassette. Migration of the 32P-labeled reaction products are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the association of PI 3-kinase with endogenous tensin, nontransfected human FS-2 fibroblast cells were quiesced as described for L-1 cells and were stimulated with PDGF-BB. Tensin was immunoprecipitated with antiserum that recognizes human tensin (R95) followed by PI 3-kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 2, endogenous tensin also forms a complex with PI 3-kinase activity, and the time course of the association of PI 3-kinase with endogenous tensin is similar to that found in NIH 3T3 cells expressing transfected chicken tensin. Thus, PI 3-kinase associates with tensin immunoprecipitates after PDGF stimulation in a transient manner, and the amount of activity recovered with tensin represents a relatively small fraction of the PI 3-kinase activity in the cell after PDGF stimulation. Possible mechanisms of PDGF-induced association of phosphoinositide kinase activity with tensin were investigated. A GST-tensin SH2 domain fusion protein was used to determine whether lipid kinases can form a complex in a PDGF-dependent manner. GST-tensin SH2 domains that were affinity-purified on Sepharose beads were incubated with NIH 3T3 cell lysates from untreated cells or cells treated with PDGF-BB. As shown in Fig. 3A, PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2 kinase activities associated with the tensin SH2 domain if the cells had been stimulated with PDGF, indicated by the formation of PtdInsP, PtdInsP2, and PtdInsP3. Lysates from unstimulated cells had only minimal PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P lipid kinase activities. The GST alone control shows that a minor amount of nonspecific phosphoinositide kinase activity associates with the beads (Fig. 3A). HPLC analysis of the deacylated lipid products revealed that the PtdInsP was both the PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-3-P isomers and that PtdInsP2 was also a mixture of PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4-P2 in unstimulated and PDGF-treated cells (Fig. 3B and Table I). The production of PtdInsP3 was inconsistently detected at very low levels in unstimulated cells but was consistently increased in cells exposed to PDGF, and HPLC analysis confirmed the structural identity of this phosphorylated product (data not shown). The amount of PI 3-kinase activity associated with the SH2 domain of tensin increased after PDGF stimulation (Table I). Interestingly, the amount of PtdIns-4-P 3-kinase activity increased more than that of PtdIns-4,5-P2 3-kinase activity (Table I). Thus, lipid kinase activity that phosphorylates the three classical phosphoinositides (PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2) forms a complex with the SH2 domain of tensin. PDGF causes a marked increase in the amount of PI 3-kinase that associates with this complex.Table IHPLC analysis of deacylated phosphoinositides produced from the phosphoinositide kinase activity associated with the GST-tensin SH2 domainLipidIsomerUnstimulatedPDGF-BBDisintegrations/min% of totalDisintegrations/min% of totalFold stimulationPtdInsP3P1362 ± 41226.87651 ± 155463.95.6PtdInsP4P3712 ± 168873.24314 ± 267436.11.2PtdInsP23,4P2485 ± 19913.63512 ± 216755.57.2PtdInsP24,5P23086 ± 73986.42814 ± 84244.50.9PtdIns-3,4,5-P352010022051004.2 Open table in a new tab To define better the interaction of phosphoinositide kinases and tensin, we determined the phosphopeptide binding specificity of the SH2 domain of tensin using an in vitro technique that determines the recognition specificity of SH2 domains for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides (39Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C.

Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). The results of selection are shown in Fig. 4. A strong preference for negatively charged amino acids was detected at the +1 position following the phosphorylated tyrosine residue, as indicated by the selection of E and D (Fig. 4A). The +2 position was strongly selective for N (Fig. 4B), and the +3 position had a preference for a hydrophobic residue (I, F, or V) (Fig. 4C). This selection is consistent with the SH2 domain of tensin being in the group 1B category of SH2 domains, as previously suggested from SH2 domain sequence similarities (40Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). To investigate the binding of the lipid kinase activity with the SH2 domain of tensin, we tested the ability of phosphopeptides to block the association. Phosphopeptides were incubated with the GST-tensin SH2 domain and then mixed with unstimulated or PDGF-stimulated cell lysates. The optimal phosphopeptide sequence determined from the library selection was used (GDGpYENISPLLL). As shown in Fig. 5, all three products of the lipid kinase reaction (PtdInsP, PtdInsP2, and PtdInsP3) showed a dose-dependent decrease in association with the SH2 domain of tensin with increasing phosphopeptide concentration. The half-maximal concentration for inhibition was approximately 2 μ. To provide additional evidence that the lipid kinase activity associates with the SH2 domain of tensin in the classical SH2 domain/phosphopeptide manner, we performed competition experiments with o-phosphotyrosine in place of the phosphopeptides. Phosphotyrosine alone blocks the association of kinases with the ability to phosphorylate PtdIns, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2 with equal concentration dependence (data not shown). The concentration of 50% inhibition is ∼2 m. Thus, PI 3-kinase activity associates with the SH2 domain of tensin in the traditional phosphopeptide/SH2 domain manner. Tensin has been proposed to play an important role in signal transduction and cytoskeletal integrity (41Lo S.H. Chen L.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1994; 13: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In an effort to help characterize its function and to elucidate the potential signal transduction mechanisms, we investigated the biochemistry of tensin. Data presented in this paper indicate that both PtdIns and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase activity are present in both unstimulated and PDGF-stimulated tensin immunoprecipitates, suggesting that these enzymes are located at focal adhesions. The phosphoinositide products of these enzymes are implicated in cytoskeletal organization and have been shown to interact with a number of actin-binding proteins (15Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The conventional polyphosphoinositides generally promote the polymerization of actin filaments, mainly by relieving the inhibition of polymerization caused by proteins that sequester actin monomers and cap the ends of actin filaments. Tensin may help to localize PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase to focal adhesions, playing an important role in the cortical actin network. Indeed, phosphoinositide kinases have been localized to the cytoskeleton (42Payrastre B. van Bergen Henegouwen P.M.P. Breton M. den Hartigh J.C. Plantavid M. Verkleij A.J. Boonstra J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). PDGF induces the specific association of PI 3-kinase activity in tensin immunoprecipitates from tensin-transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and nontransfected human fibroblasts. The PDGF-dependent association of tensin and PI 3-kinase can be reproduced in vitro with the SH2 domain of tensin, suggesting a biochemical mechanism for the association. This biochemical mechanism is supported by the observation that this association can be blocked with a phosphopeptide specific for the SH2 domain of tensin at concentrations consistent with the KD of other SH2 domains. Scanning the sequences of p85α, p85β, p110α, and p110β for sequences that recognize the SH2 domain of tensin suggest that the interaction may be indirect; thus another protein may facilitate the interaction. The binding specificity of the SH2 domain of tensin places it in a family of SH2 domains with interesting characteristics, including abl, 3BP2, and GRB2 (40Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Ren R. Baltimore D. Ratnofsky S. Feldman R.A. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), which also have a strong preference for N at the +2 position. Because the binding characteristics of these proteins are similar, their targets in vivo may overlap. One model to explain our observation that PI 3-kinase is found in tensin immunoprecipitates is based on the preferred binding motif of tensin (Fig. 4). The SH2 domain of tensin could bind to the phosphorylated tyrosine 925 of FAK. This site has recently been shown to bind GRB2 both in vitro and in vivo (43Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). FAK, in turn, has an optimal binding sequence for PI 3-kinase at tyrosine 950 and has been shown to have a direct and PDGF-induced interaction with PI 3-kinase (35Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10148-10152Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 44Chen H.-C. Guan J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, Miyamoto et al. (30Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) have shown that both tensin and FAK are recruited to a bead-induced focal adhesion complex prior to the recruitment of the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase. The recruitment of the 85-kDa subunit was also dependent on tyrosine kinase activity. Thus, FAK is a potential bridge between PI 3-kinase and tensin. The precise role of PI 3-kinase in the focal adhesion is currently unknown. Cells that are attached to fibronectin and stimulated with PDGF demonstrate enhanced metabolism of inositol lipids (45McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In our studies, PDGF stimulation did not cause a change in the amount of PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase activity binding to the SH2 domain of tensin (Table I), suggesting that the conventional phosphoinositide kinase activities are probably not regulated directly by PDGF via the SH2 domain of tensin. Recent evidence in fibroblasts suggests that PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase is regulated by the small GTP-binding protein Rho (46Chong L.D. Traynor K.A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, Rho induces stress fiber and focal adhesion formation (47Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar). The 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase contains a region with sequences similar to the region of bcr that has GTPase activity for the Rho family of proteins (48Otsu M. Hiles I. Gout I. Fry M.J. Ruiz-Larrea F. Panayotou G. Thompson A. Dhand R. Hsuan J. Totty N. Smith A.D. Morgan S.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 91-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 49Baldwin G.S. Zhang Q.X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 378-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is possible that tensin, by assisting in the localization of PI 3-kinase activity to focal adhesions, allows PI 3-kinase to play an important role in the Rho signal transduction cascade involved in cytoskeletal rearrangements. It is noteworthy that an optimal binding sequence for the tensin SH2 domain is present in tensin at tyrosine 393, located in the second actin binding domain (6Lo S.H. Janmey P.A. Hartwig J.H. Chen L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this tyrosine is phosphorylated. However, dimerization or intramolecular folding of tensin mediated by phosphorylation and subsequent SH2 domain binding may lead to important conformational and biochemical changes in the function of tensin. For example, the recent model proposed for vinculin by Johnson and Craig (50Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) is similar to a model we would propose for tensin. Phosphorylation of tensin on tyrosine 393 would create a binding site for the SH2 domain of tensin. This would provide a regulated mechanism to induce a conformational change in tensin and could produce an intramolecular head-to-tail structure. This conformation or the phosphorylation itself could have a direct effect on the actin binding domain and thus be important for tensin and actin interactions.

To evaluate the susceptibility of these cytokine specific cytoplasmic transducers to activation, ST14A cells were stably transfected with the α and β (AIC2A) chains of the murine interleukin-3 receptor. Four independent lines expressing both the α and β receptor subunits were obtained. We found that cells from each of these lines were induced to proliferate upon exposure to interleukin-3. Dose response curve, antibody blocking experiments and binding studies revealed that the response was mediated by the reconstituted high affinity interleukin-3 receptor. Immunoprecipitation studies on these cells showed that Jak2 and Stat5 were being phosphorylated after stimulation of the reconstituted receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2028295775,"RNA polymerase II may stop transcription, or arrest, while transcribing certain DNA sequences. The molecular basis for arrest is not well understood, but a connection has been suggested between arrest and a transient failure of the polymerase to translocate along the template. We have investigated this question by monitoring the movement of RNA polymerase II along a number of templates, using exonuclease III protection as our assay. We found that normal transcription is accompanied by essentially coordinate movement of the active site and both the leading and trailing edges of the polymerase. However, as polymerase approaches an arrest site, translocation of the body of the polymerase stops while transcription continues, leading to an arrested complex in which the 3′ end of the transcript is located much closer than normal to the front edge of the polymerase. Surprisingly, mutated arrest sites that no longer block transcription continue to direct the transient failure of polymerase translocation. As transcription proceeds through these sequences, the initially stationary polymerase moves forward 10-15 bases along the template in response to the addition of only 3 bases to the nascent RNA. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the sequences responsible for the transient block to polymerase movement are located downstream of the T-rich motif required for arrest. Our results indicate that blocking translocation is not sufficient to cause arrest. RNA polymerase II may stop transcription, or arrest, while transcribing certain DNA sequences. The molecular basis for arrest is not well understood, but a connection has been suggested between arrest and a transient failure of the polymerase to translocate along the template. We have investigated this question by monitoring the movement of RNA polymerase II along a number of templates, using exonuclease III protection as our assay.

Our results indicate that blocking translocation is not sufficient to cause arrest. It is increasingly evident that the elongation phase of transcription by RNA polymerase II is a potential target for regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1Spencer C.A. Groudine M.

Protein factors that influence transcript elongation have been isolated and DNA sequences through which elongation proceeds inefficiently in vitro have been identified (recently reviewed in Ref. 4Aso T. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A fraction of the RNA polymerases which attempt to transcribe these special sequences cease RNA synthesis, thereby entering a state called arrest. Arrested elongation complexes have not terminated, but they can only resume chain elongation very slowly, even in the presence of high levels of NTPs (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Rapid recovery from arrest requires the action of the elongation factor SII, or TFIIS (6Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M.

To resume elongation, an arrested transcription complex must cleave the nascent RNA upstream of the 3′ end, thereby generating a new 3′ end from which transcription continues (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Reines D. Ghanouni P. Li Q. Mote Jr., J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15516-15522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transcript cleavage reaction thus allows the transcription complex another opportunity to pass the arrest site. Elongation complexes which have paused in transcription simply because of the depletion of NTPs from the reaction mixture, which we refer to as stalled complexes, will resume transcription in an SII-independent manner as soon as NTPs are supplied (10Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of at least two different functional modes during elongation may reflect structural variations among ternary complexes as transcription proceeds. Chamberlin (11Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; (Series 88): 1-21PubMed Google Scholar) has suggested a model for translocation of the RNA polymerase along the DNA template in which all elongation complexes are not structurally equivalent. It was proposed that, while the active site moves continuously downstream on the coding strand, the body of the RNA polymerase translocates discontinuously. The overall advance of the polymerase was envisioned to occur through an advance of the trailing edge, with the leading edge held stationary, followed by a downstream jump of the leading edge, in the manner of an inchworm (11Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; (Series 88): 1-21PubMed Google Scholar). This model also suggested a mechanism for arrest. If translocation of the leading edge of the polymerase were somehow blocked, the body of the RNA polymerase could respond with a relaxation in the upstream direction, thereby carrying the active site away from the 3′ end of the nascent RNA. In this case the active site might move upstream along the transcript, consistent with the proposal (12Rudd M.D. Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8057-8061Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that the transcript cleavage required for relief of arrest occurs at the active site. Several laboratories (13Krummel B.

(14Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) found that the distance from the 3′ end of the transcript to the leading edge of the polymerase (the catalytic site-to-front edge, or CF, 1The abbreviations used are: CFcatalytic site-to-front edgeexoIIIexonuclease IIIbpbase pair(s). distance) was the same for most complexes examined. However, at certain template locations the leading edge failed to continue translocation, resulting in a decreasing CF value as RNA synthesis proceeded. This strained configuration of the polymerase was resolved either by a discontinuous forward movement of the front edge of the enzyme or by a failure to continue transcription (see also Refs. 13Krummel B. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and 16Wang D. Meier T.I. Chan C.L. Feng G. Lee D.N. Landick R.

Complexes which were blocked in elongation were much more sensitive to transcript cleavage by the GreB elongation factor (14Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M.

They found that an arrested complex had a much shorter CF distance than a complex which had recovered from arrest via transcript cleavage, suggesting that distortion of the polymerase from transient failure of the leading edge to translocate is involved in the loss of elongation competence for RNA polymerase II as well. catalytic site-to-front edge exonuclease III base pair(s). In the studies reported here, we have examined the dimensions of many RNA polymerase II ternary complexes, both arrested and stalled. Consistent with earlier work, we find that all complexes which are fully or partially arrested show a shortened CF distance. However, we have also identified a number of compressed complexes which are completely elongation-competent. Thus, the shortening of the catalytic site-front edge distance appears to be necessary but not sufficient for arrest. We also show that sequences which seem to be crucial in blocking translocation of the leading edge of polymerase are located downstream of the T-rich core of the arrest site. Ultrapure (FPLC purified) NTPs, dNTPs, and dideoxy-NTPs were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. and 32P-labeled NTPs from DuPont NEN. Bio-Gel A1.5m was acquired from Bio-Rad. Exonuclease III, placental ribonuclease inhibitor, Taq polymerase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Recombinant human elongation factor SII (rSII), purified as described previously (19Yoo O. Yoon H. Baek K. Jeon C. Miyamoto K. Ueno A. Agarwal K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1073-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was a generous gift from R. Landick (University of Wisconsin-Madison). All plasmids used in this study were based on pML20, which contains the adenovirus 2 major late promoter cloned into pUC18 (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Several important modifications were made to generate DNA templates suitable for subsequent enzymatic manipulations. First, linker L1 (see Table I) was inserted between the DraI site (+20 relative to transcription start site) and the BamHI site of pML20. The SmaI-ApaI portion of this intermediate construct was replaced with the 228-bp SmaI-ApaI fragment from pGR220 (20Rice G.A. Kane C.M. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by C. Kane), which contains a 135-bp cassette with no T residues on one strand. The 70-bp EcoRI-AflIII fragment in the distal part of the promoter (from −181 to −111) was deleted and replaced with linker L2 which contains an SstI site. A 136-bp fragment, extending from a SacII site within the pGR220 insert to the BamHI site, was substituted with linker L3, which contains StuI and XhoI sites. Finally, the StuI-XhoI fragment of DNA was substituted with linker L4 to generate pML20-23.Table ILinkers and primers used for cloningL15′-AAACCCGGGCGAGCTCGGGCCCTTG-3′3′-TTTGGGCCCGCTCGAGCCCGGGAACCTAG-5′DraI SmaI ApaI BamHIL25′-AATTCGGTACCGAGCTCA-3′3′-GCCATGGCTCGAGTGTAC5′EcoRI SstI AflIIIL35′-GGCAGGCCTTTCGGGGAACTCGAGGTGTCCACGTAG-3′3′-CGCCGTCCGGAAAGCCCCTTGAGCTCCACAGGTGCATCCTAG-5′SacII StuI XhoI BamHIL45′-AAGAGGAAGAAGCAGGCCTTTGGGAAACCC-3′3′-TTCTCCTTCTTCGTCCGGAAACCCTTTGGGAGCT-5′StuI XhoIPr1195′-GCAAGAATTTTTAAAAGAGAGGCCTTTTTTTCCC-3′Pr1205′-CATGCCTGCAGGTCGAAAATACC-3′Pr1245′-CCTTGGTATCCCGAGTTTGGAGAG-3′Pr1255′-CCTTTGGGAAACCCGTTTGGAGAGGCGG-3′Pr1265′-CCTTGGTATCCCGAGTTTGGTGTCCACGTAGG-3′pUC5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′ Open table in a new tab Construction of pML20-30 was a two-step process. First, the segment of pML20-23 from the StuI site to the PstI site in the vector was replaced with a modified DraI-PstI fragment from pADMterm-2 (18Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by D. Reines). This 142-bp DNA was generated using the polymerase chain reaction. The upstream primer Pr119 (see Table I) overlapped the DraI site and contained three point mutations to generate a StuI site, while the downstream primer Pr120 overlapped the PstI site. The resulting construct was further modified by deleting a 69-bp NsiI-TaqI fragment downstream of the T-rich arrest site within the cloned sequence. The pML20-36 and pML20-38 constructs were assembled by replacing the StuI-HindIII (+157 to +212) DNA of pML20-30 with a modified StuI-HindIII fragment synthesized on the pML20-30 template using primer Pr124 (for pML20-36) or Pr125 (for pML20-38) and the M13/pUC sequencing (−20) 17-mer (Pharmacia) as primers for PCR. The pML20-37 template was assembled by replacing the StuI-HindIII (+147 to +210) fragment of pML20-23 with a DNA fragment synthesized on the pML20-23 template using mismatched primer Pr126 and the M13/pUC 17-mer primer. All of the pML20-XX series templates were sequenced for verification. Plasmid DNA was linearized by digestion with either SstI for non-template strand labeling or with PstI for labeling of the template strand. Linearized DNA was treated with calf intestine phosphatase and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP to a typical specific activity of 1.5-3 × 106 cpm/μg using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). DNA labeled at the SstI end was subsequently digested with HindIII and EcoRI, which gave three fragments: a uniquely single-end-labeled DNA containing the promoter and the U-free cassette (323 or 325 bp), a small (12 bp) end-labeled EcoRI-SstI fragment, and the 2.8-kilobase pair unlabeled portion of pUC18. Similarly, DNA labeled at the PstI end was digested with HindIII and SstI. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation before use as a template for transcription. Ternary complexes either stalled or arrested at specific positions on the DNA template were generated essentially as described previously with minor modifications (10Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, preinitiation complexes were assembled on end-labeled linear DNA templates by incubation with HeLa cell nuclear extract; the total DNA concentration in this reaction, which included both the template and the other DNA fragments generated by digestion of the plasmid, was 20-35 μg/ml. Residual NTPs were removed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel A1.5m. Complexes were advanced to +20 (U20 complexes) by incubation with 2 m ApC, 10 μ dATP, 20 μ GTP, 20 μ UTP, and 1 μ [α-32P] CTP at 30°C for 5 min followed by another 5 min incubation after the addition of CTP to 20 μ. The stalled ternary complexes were further purified by the addition of 1% Sarkosyl and incubation for 5 min at 30°C, followed by another round of Bio-Gel A1.5m gel filtration. To generate ternary elongation complexes stalled at the end of the U-free cassette, Sarkosyl-rinsed U20 complexes were chased by adding 8 m MgCl2 and 200 μ ATP, GTP, and CTP for 10 min at 37°C. To create arrested complexes on the pML20-36 template, U20 complexes were chased with all four NTPs at 200 μ. Complexes assembled on the SstI end-labeled template and paused at the end of the U-free cassette were incubated with restriction enzyme StuI (0.2 unit/μl for 10 min at 37°C). Analogous complexes assembled on templates labeled at the PstI site were treated with both StuI and SmaI (0.2 unit/μl each, 10 min at 37°C). Ribonuclease inhibitor was added to the reaction mixture at this and all subsequent steps to a final concentration 50 units/ml. After the restriction enzyme digestion, complexes were either immediately treated with exonuclease III or gel-filtered a second time and incubated with an appropriate subset of NTPs, as indicated in the text. The exonuclease III concentration and digestion time for each set of experiments is given in the corresponding figure and legend. The reactions were stopped by adding EDTA to 20 m final concentration. DNA and RNA were purified as described (21Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the indicated cases, half of the sample underwent additional treatment with RNase A (50 μg/ml, 30 min at 37°C) followed by proteinase K digestion (0.2 mg/ml for 10 min at 37°C), phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Samples were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels consisting of 6% (19:1) or 10% (19:1) acrylamide:bisacrylamide and visualized either by autoradiography (Kodak X-AR or Kodak Biomax) or with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The exact length DNA markers were generated by primer extension using the same DNA template employed in the experiment, dNTP mixes with a single dideoxy-NTP, [α-32P]dCTP, Taq polymerase and synthesized primers. Primers were phosphorylated before addition to the reaction. We used exonuclease III (exoIII) digestion as a probe for structural differences between arrested and stalled RNA polymerase II transcription complexes. Our general strategy was to compare elongation competent and incompetent complexes prepared on templates which were as similar in sequence as possible. The approach is presented schematically in Fig. 1. We constructed a series of templates based on the plasmid pML20 (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), which contains the adenovirus major late promoter. For each template, the initial 20 bases of the transcript contain no A residues, and the next 131 or 141 bases of RNA contain no U residues. The template segment encoding the U-free cassette ends at a cleavage site for the restriction enzyme StuI. A variety of sequences were placed immediately downstream of the StuI site, allowing RNA polymerase II complexes to be stalled or arrested in this region. We deliberately analyzed complexes which were halted a relatively long distance downstream of +1, instead of using more convenient, promoter-proximal stalling sites, because we wanted to guarantee that our complexes had completed any transitions out of the initiating state (14Nudler E. Goldfarb A. Kashlev M. Science. 1994; 265: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Linn S.C. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1508-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (but see also Marshall and Price (23Marshall N.F. Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2078-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar)). The generation of polymerase II complexes halted at defined sites on the template has been described in detail previously (21Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 683-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 1). Briefly, preinitiation complexes were formed by incubation of DNA with Hela cell nuclear extract and purified by gel filtration. Incubation of these complexes with ApC, GTP, UTP, and [α-32P]CTP resulted in elongation to the end of the A-free cassette. Transcription stalls after incorporation of the U residue at position +20, giving a stable U20 complex. These complexes were purified by the addition of 1% Sarkosyl followed by gel filtration, which removes the detergent, the NTPs and most proteins, including free transcript elongation factors. The Sarkosyl-rinsed U20 complexes were chased with ATP, CTP and GTP to the end of the U-free cassette and gel-filtered again to remove NTPs; the polymerases were then advanced to various stalling sites with subsets of the NTPs. If the template contained an arrest site, the polymerases were simply advanced to that site directly from U20 by incubation with all four NTPs. To determine the front edge boundary, elongation complexes were assembled on linear DNA templates labeled with 32P at the 5′-end of the non-template strand. The upstream ends of the templates had 3′ overhangs and were thus resistant to exoIII digestion (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transcription complexes were generated and advanced to the end of the U-free cassette as just described. They were then treated with StuI, which cleaved those DNAs that did not bear a transcription complex. The StuI treatment was necessary because only about 1-2% of DNA templates are transcribed in vitro by RNA polymerase II from HeLa nuclear extracts (22Linn S.C. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1508-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that an unavoidable background from incomplete exoIII digestion of the large excess of nontranscribed templates obscured the protection patterns generated by the transcription complexes. Truncation of the nontranscribed DNA by StuI cleavage eliminated this background and greatly improved our results. All of the complexes we analyzed stopped transcription within 12 bases of the end of the U-free cassette, in order to guarantee that the complexes would protect the StuI site. After StuI treatment and gel filtration to remove NTPs, the complexes were advanced to their final position and treated with exoIII. In most experiments the DNA and the RNA were labeled, allowing us to monitor both the template protection boundaries and the position of the catalytic site at the same time. The procedure for mapping the rear edge boundaries of the elongation complexes was identical to that just described except that the 5′ recessed end of the template strand was labeled (see “Experimental Procedures”). We first measured template protection by stalled RNA polymerase II transcription complexes. To generate these complexes at the appropriate location for analysis, we constructed a template, designated pML20-23, with the sequence TTTGGGAAACCC on the non-template strand immediately downstream of the StuI site at the end of the U-free cassette. This particular sequence allowed us to advance the polymerase to three new locations downstream of the StuI site, spanning a total of 9 bases along the template, simply by incubation with subsets of the NTPs. The insert in pML20-23 did not contain any sequences resembling known arrest sites. Complexes were assembled on this template and chased to the end of the U-free cassette, at position +151, as described above. The RNAs in these complexes are shown in lane 1 of Fig. 2A. While about half of complexes contained RNA of the predicted size, the other half stalled at position +152. We presume this resulted from trace contamination of chase NTPs with UTP. We have not been able to eliminate this problem, because of the relatively high (200 μ) concentration of ATP, CTP, and GTP needed to obtain efficient elongation to the end of the U-free cassette. After gel filtration, the C151/U152 complexes were advanced with 15 μ UTP (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), UTP and GTP (lanes 5 and 6), or UTP, GTP, and ATP (lanes 7 and 8); the complexes in lanes 9 and 10 were chased with all four NTPs. To distinguish between the labeled RNA and a background of bands from the labeled DNA, portions of the samples were treated with RNase A (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Note that nearly all of the C151/U152 complexes advanced when NTPs were added. Also, almost all of the U154, G157, and A160 complexes chased when subsequently challenged with all four NTPs (data not shown). Thus, complexes C151, U154, G157, and A160 were genuinely stalled and not arrested. We always observe a small proportion (5-10%) of complexes that fail to restart whenever RNA polymerase II is halted in chain elongation for any length of time. The amount of residual RNA left at positions 151/152 in lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9 is typical for stalled complexes (see also Izban and Luse (5Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). The downstream, or front edge, boundaries of template protection for the C151/U152, U154, G157, and A160 complexes were determined using exoIII digestion after StuI cleavage, as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 2B. As expected, most of the DNA was cleaved by StuI (lane 1); the ratio of the intensities of the full-length and StuI-cut bands was about 1:50. Note that, in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all RNAs and DNAs are labeled according to their length. In the case of DNA, this indicates distance from the 5′ end label, not distance from the start of transcription. The locations of the ends of DNA fragments produced by exoIII digestion relative to the 3′ ends of the RNA in each complexes are summarized in Fig. 6. When the StuI-cleaved C151/U152 complexes were treated with exoIII, the 323-nucleotide full-length DNA was truncated to a set of bands, the most prominent at 284 nucleotides (Fig. 2B, dotted band, lanes 3 and 4). This places the front edge of the polymerase about 19 nucleotides downstream of the position of the catalytic site. For ease of description, we will refer to the last base transcribed as the location of the catalytic site. It is possible, particularly in arrested complexes, that the active site is no longer located near the position where the last bond was formed, a point to which we will return under “Discussion.” For each of the other complexes, a similar protection edge with a single prominent band was obtained after exoIII digestion. Significantly, the major boundary (indicated by the dots) was displaced downstream in rough synchrony with transcription, although the front edge moved exactly the same number of bases as the active site in only one case (U154 to G157).Fig. 4RNA polymerase II translocates discontinuously during the transcription of the mutated Ia arrest site sequence in pML20-36.

By discontinuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, differential sedimentation was noted for the four major Jaw1 protein isoforms, with two of the forms predominantly soluble and two microsome-bound. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitations suggest a post-translational modification of two major isoforms of the protein resulting in an increase in mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In vitro translation studies are compatible with a post-translational processing event that results in cleavage of a short 36 amino acid lumenal domain. These findings define a carboxyl-terminal domain of the Jaw1 protein that is both necessary and sufficient for ER localization. In addition, the processing of the small lumenal domain of Jaw1 represents a novel post-translational protein modification performed by the endoplasmic reticulum.

The insertion of type I membrane proteins (NexoCcyt) and all secreted proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum generally occurs co-translationally and requires the participation of signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRPsignal recognition particleERendoplasmic reticulumCTMAcarboxyl-terminal membrane anchorsPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTMtransmembraneCMPKchicken muscle pyruvate kinasePBSphosphate-buffered salineRERrough endoplasmic reticulumIVTin vitro translationAbantibodyMAbmonoclonal antibodyPDIprotein disulfide isomerase.

The 54-kDa subunit of SRP binds to the amino-terminal signal sequence of nascent protein chains and delivers the nascent protein-ribosome complex to the ER membrane where docking and translocation of the nascent chain into the ER lumen commences (3Bernstein H.D.

After cleavage of the signal peptide in the lumen of the ER by signal peptidase, translocation of the polypeptide proceeds (reviewed in Ref. 5Simon S. Curr. Opin.

Most type II proteins (NcytCexo) possess an uncleaved hydrophobic domain near the amino terminus that serves as both a signal sequence and an anchor domain (6Rapoport T.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2792-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Following targeting of a type II nascent protein chain and ribosome to the ER membrane by SRP, the carboxyl terminus is translocated across the ER membrane while the amino terminus remains cytosolic. The charged amino acids that flank hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domains are thought to play an important role in determining the ultimate orientation of the protein in the membrane. According to the “positive inside” rule of von Heijne, the flanking region with the greatest net positive charge is generally oriented facing the cytosol (7von Heijne G. Gavel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 174: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). A survey of a large number of integral membrane proteins confirmed this prediction, showing that the difference in charges of the 15 amino acids on either side of the first internal signal-anchor determines the topology of the mature protein (8Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). By mutating key charged residues that flank the TM domain of a type II viral protein, topology could be inverted to a type I orientation (9Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these charge differences are sensed at the ER membrane is not known (10Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Recently, a class of integral membrane proteins with carboxyl-terminal membrane anchors (CTMAs) was identified (11Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This class includes a large number of proteins that are important for the targeting and fusion of intracellular vesicles (v- and t-SNARE ( soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins) (12Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument B.H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2638) Google Scholar), membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatases, cytochromes, and others (see Ref. 11Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Proteins of this class are characterized by the presence of a carboxyl-terminal membrane spanning domain without an amino-terminal signal sequence and are oriented facing the cytosol. The mechanism by which CTMA proteins target to and insert in membranes has not been well studied. In a recent study, we reported the cloning and initial characterization of a lymphoid-restricted protein called Jaw1 (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). Jaw1 has a coiled-coil domain in the middle-third of the protein and a carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor with a conserved 36-amino acid lumenal tail. Expression of Jaw1 mRNA and protein is developmentally regulated in both the B and T cell lineages with highest expression in pre-T, pre-B, and mature B cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that Jaw1 protein is expressed exclusively in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein co-localized with the ER marker BiP in lymphocytes by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. When transfected into Hela cells, which lack the protein, Jaw1 targeted to the ER as demonstrated by co-localization with the ER lumenal protein, PDI. Furthermore, in an in vitro translation system the Jaw1 protein inserts into pancreatic microsomes and behaves as an integral membrane protein. Thus, these data suggest that Jaw1 is a resident protein of the ER. Based on its expression pattern and localization to the ER, the protein may have a role in the developmentally regulated trafficking of the antigen receptors in B and T cells, antigen receptor assembly, or may otherwise influence lymphoid development. In this report we provide evidence that the ER localization domain of Jaw1 resides within the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids containing the membrane anchor. In addition, we describe a novel post-translational processing event at the carboxyl terminus of the Jaw1 protein upon insertion of the protein into microsome membranes and demonstrate that Jaw1 associates with the ER membrane post-translationally. These findings have implications for the targeting and membrane insertion of the class of proteins that contain carboxyl-terminal membrane anchors. The full-length mouse Jaw1 cDNA was described previously (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). For the CMPK-Jaw1 fusion construct, PCR was used to amplify the region from His-469 to Val-539 of the mouse Jaw1 cDNA with BamHI 5′ and EcoRI 3′. This fragment was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the CMPK expression plasmid p3PK (14Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 481-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that contains amino acids 17-476 of CMPK. To generate the full-length mouse Jaw1 (J1) and TM-deleted (J1 TM(−)) templates, PCR was used to engineer an SP6 RNA polymerase site and a strong β-globin ATG and leader sequence at the 5′ end of each template. The sequence of the forward primer for both constructs was CTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAAACAGACACCATGGCTCTCTGTGTAAAAGGTCCC, with the last 18 bases corresponding to Jaw1 sequence beginning at amino acid 2. The reverse primer for the full-length template amplified the full-length coding region of the mouse Jaw1 cDNA including the termination codon, whereas the TM-deleted template ended at amino acid 479. Amplified products were gel-purified and used directly for transcription reactions. To construct the coiled-coil deleted FLAG-epitoped Jaw1 construct (Jaw1-FLAG), the carboxyl terminus of Jaw1 from amino acids 334-539 was amplified by PCR with 5′ HindIII and NotI sites and a 3′ BamHI site. This fragment was cloned into the HindIII and BamHI site of pSP72 (Promega). The amino terminus from amino acids 2-193 was then amplified with 5′ HindIII and NheI sites and a NotI site 3′. This was cloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of the pSP72-Jaw1-C term plasmid, effectively deleting the coiled coil region and replacing it with three amino acids provided by the NotI site. This mutant cDNA was then cut with NheI and BamHI and cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of PCG (15Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 86-375Google Scholar). This PCG construct, used originally for other unpublished experiments, was amplified with a 5′ primer corresponding to amino acids 2-7 with a 5′ NheI site and a reverse primer that added the FLAG epitope onto the extreme carboxyl terminus of Jaw1 and a new stop codon, and a BamHI cloning site. This product was gel-purified and cloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pEpi in vitro translation vector, which provides a strong translation initiation site and a TK leader sequence. 2L. Staudt, unpublished. All engineered constructs were sequenced to ensure fidelity of PCR. Hela cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips in a 100-mm culture dish and were transfected by the CaPO4 method (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Forty eight hours after transfection the cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized in 1% Triton/PBS for 2 min, and blocked in 10% goat serum, 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS. All subsequent steps were performed in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. Coverslips were incubated with an affinity purified CMPK rabbit antiserum (gift of J. Frangioni and B. Neel) for 1 h, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Abs (1:100) (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min. Cells were then blocked in 1% rabbit sera, which were included in subsequent incubations. The cells were then incubated with an anti-PDI MAb (RL 77, kindly provided by S. Koetzel, Case Western Reserve) used at 1:2000 which was detected with a Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ab (1:100) (Jackson Immunoresearch). In experiments not shown, double fluorescence was performed with markers for the Golgi, lysosomes, and endosomes, none of which significantly overlapped with the CMPK-Jaw1 images. Coverslips were examined with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope fitted with an Argon/Krypton dual laser. Simultaneous double fluorescence was detected using 488 and 568 nm laser lines. Images were merged using Bio-Rad Comos software and printed with a Sony UP 5000 printer. Control incubations ruled out any cross-reactions between the various reagents. One liter of the mouse B cell line WEHI 231 was grown in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum in log phase to a density of 9 × 105 cells/ml. The cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, and the cell pellet was suspended in 5 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (buffer A, 10 m HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 10 m KOAc, 7.5 m MgOAc, 1.5 m dithiothreitol, 10 IU aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The suspension was homogenized with 15 strokes in a 7.5-ml Dounce vessel with an A pestle. Approximately 70% lysis was confirmed by light microscopy. Nuclei and nonlysed cells were removed with a 2,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C. The salt and buffer concentration of the postnuclear supernatant was then adjusted to 50 m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 m KOAc, 5 m MgOAc, 1 m dithiothreitol (buffer B), and 0.25 sucrose, and the volume was increased to 13.5 ml. A 2.25-ml cushion of 2.0 sucrose in buffer B was overlaid with 2.25 ml of 1.3 sucrose/buffer B cushion in Beckman 7/16 × 5 1/2-inch centrifuge tubes. Finally, this was overlaid with 6.75 ml of postnuclear supernatant in 0.25 sucrose/buffer B. Duplicate samples were ultracentrifuged in an SW41 swinging bucket rotor at 4°C and 28,000 rpm (approximately 140,000 × g) for 3 h. There were two distinct bands at both the 0.25/1.3 (1a and 1b) and 1.3/2.0 (2a and 2b) interfaces. The upper band at the 1.3/2.0 sucrose interface (interface 2a), expected to be enriched for rough ER, was heavy and brown in color. The various gradients and interfaces were removed with a pipetteman, and the fractions from duplicate samples were combined. Equivalent aliquots (1/500) of the postnuclear supernatant, each sucrose gradient, and interface were analyzed by immunoblotting. A 10% SDS-PAGE gel was transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. The filter was blocked in TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 50 m Tris 7.5, 150 m NaCl) with 1% fraction V bovine serum albumin, 4% Carnation's dry, low fat milk, and 0.1% Triton for 2 h, and then washed in TBS/0.3% Triton. The blot was incubated with affinity purified rabbit-anti-Jaw1 antibodies (200 ng/ml) in blocking buffer for 1 h, and washed in TBS/0.3% Triton. For detection, the blot was incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Abs (Bio-Rad) at a 1:5,000 dilution in blocking buffer. Following washes in TBS/0.3% and a rinse in TBS alone, the blot was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The blot was then stripped and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of a MAb against ribophorin I (kindly provided by G. Kreibich, New York University) followed by 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Abs (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometry of the blots was performed as described (17Correa-Rotter R. Mariash C.N. Rosenberg M.E. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 154-158PubMed Google Scholar). Both the mouse and human full-length cDNAs were linearized with XhoI, and in vitro RNA was transcribed using T3 polymerase (Stratagene). The Jaw1-FLAG construct was linearized with BamHI and RNA was transcribed using SP6 polymerase. SP6 was also used to transcribe RNA from the J1 and J1TM(−) gel-purified templates. The c-erbA α1 cDNA (kindly provided by K. Strait and J. Oppenheimer, University of Minnesota) was linearized with BamHI and in vitro RNA transcribed using T7 polymerase. In vitro translations were performed typically in a volume of 15 μl, with 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 μl of RNA (1 μg/ul), 1.5 μl of 10 × Translation mixture (minus methionine, Life Technologies, Inc.), 25 μCi of [35S]methionine (>800 Ci/mmol, 10-15 mCi/ml, Amersham Corp.), and DEPC-treated H20, according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Commercially prepared canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) were added at the beginning of the translation or after the translation with or without 1 m cold methionine. To pellet the microsome membranes, the translated lysates were diluted to 25 μl with IVT dilution buffer (140 m KOAc, 2.5 m MgOAc, 1 m dithiothreitol, 50 m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5) and carefully layered over a 100-μl cushion of 0.5 sucrose in IVT dilution buffer in airfuge tubes. Samples were spun for 3 min at 29 p.s.i. in a Beckman airfuge at room temperature, and supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Membrane pellets and precipitated supernatant proteins were solubilized in 2 × SDS loading buffer with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 20 min at room temperature and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Corp.) before fluorography. For metabolic labeling experiments, the 38B9 mouse pre-B cell line was grown in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum and harvested while growing in log phase. Cells were washed in methionine-free RPMI, resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in methionine-free media supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 10 m HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, and then incubated for 15 min at 37°C to deplete intracellular methionine pools. Cells were then pelleted and metabolically labeled in methionine-free complete media supplemented with 100 μCi/ml in vitro translation grade [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) for 10 min at 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cold methionine was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 m, and the cells were chased for varying lengths of time. Cells were then pelleted, washed in ice-cold PBS × 2, and lysed by the addition of 500 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (1% Triton, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 m Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors) per 5 × 106 cells and incubated on ice for 30 min. Nuclei and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Lysates were precleared with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads preloaded with 7 μl of normal rabbit sera overnight at 4°C on a rotator. The next day beads were pelleted, and the lysates were diluted 1:1 with ice-cold NET-gel (0.1% Triton, 50 m Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 1 m EDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.02% azide) and were incubated with beads preloaded with either affinity purified anti-Jaw1 Abs or normal rabbit sera for 4 h at 4°C on a rotator. Beads were then washed sequentially with NET-gel with 500 m NaCl, NET-gel with 0.1% SDS, and finally with 10 m Tris, 0.1% Triton. After careful removal of the last wash, immunoprecipitated protein on beads was solubilized with 40 μl of 1 × SDS loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed by fluorography. For immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated proteins, an identical protocol was used except that 1% Triton was the only detergent used in the lysis buffer. The M2 monoclonal Ab recognizing the FLAG epitope (IBI, Kodak) was preloaded on protein A beads and was used as described above, except that the NET-gel/0.1% SDS wash was omitted. We have previously shown that the Jaw1 protein co-localizes with the ER marker BiP in lymphocytes, targets to the ER when transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and is oriented on the cytosolic face of the ER (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the structure of the cDNA and its association with ER membranes in vitro (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the carboxyl terminus of Jaw1, which contains a TM domain, was the targeting signal that directed the protein to the ER (see Fig. 1A for a diagram of the full-length cDNA). To test this, a fragment of the mouse Jaw1 cDNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids of mouse Jaw1 was cloned downstream of a cDNA encoding a cytoplasmic protein, chicken muscle pyruvate kinase (CMPK), in an expression vector (see Fig. 1, CMPK-J1-71), and this construct was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. The CMPK-Jaw1 fusion protein (Fig. 2A) co-localized with the ER protein PDI (Fig. 2B), whereas CMPK alone was localized diffusely throughout the cytosol (Fig. 2C). Co-localization of the CMPK-Jaw1 protein with PDI was confirmed by computer merging of the confocal images (not shown). A fusion protein of CMPK plus the carboxyl-terminal 150 amino acids of Jaw1 also targeted to the ER, whereas a fusion of CMPK with the 36 lumenal amino acids of Jaw1 remained cytosolic (data not shown). In other experiments, 3L. Synder, J. Benninck, T. Behrens, and J. Yewdell, manuscript in preparation. overexpression of mutant Jaw1 proteins that remove the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids resulted in a cytosolic distribution of the protein as determined by both immunofluorescent staining and immunogold electron microscopy. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids of Jaw1, which contain the TM domain, are both necessary and sufficient for targeting to the ER.Fig. 2The carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids of Jaw1 target a heterologous protein to the ER. A fusion protein of CMPK and the carboxyl-terminal 71 amino acids of Jaw1 was transfected into HeLa cells and stained with a CMPK antiserum (A) and anti-PDI antibodies (B). The parent vector CMPK alone was transfected into HeLa cells and stained with anti-CMPK antibodies (C) and anti-PDI antibodies (D). The transfected fusion protein (A) co-localized with PDI (B) demonstrating targeting to the ER. CMPK alone (C) was found to be expressed diffusely in the cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was shown previously that Jaw1 protein translated in vitro in the presence of canine microsomes associated tightly with the microsomal membranes and could not be extracted with either high ionic strength or high pH, consistent with its being an integral membrane protein (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). We next investigated the behavior of a TM-deleted mutant of Jaw1 in an in vitro translation (IVT) system. Both full-length and TM(−) Jaw1 cDNAs (see Fig. 1A) were cloned into an IVT vector that contributed a strong translation initiation site resulting in a single translated protein species (in contrast with the multiple species observed when full-length Jaw1 cDNAs containing 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions and the native initiator methionine were translated, see below). The mutant IVT Jaw1 protein (J1TM(−)) did not pellet with the microsomal membranes but instead partitioned exclusively in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 3, lanes 3 amd 4). This mutant behaved identically to c-erbA, a protein that does not associate with membranes (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6), but in contrast to wild-type Jaw1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Taken together, these data suggest that the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region of Jaw1 functions as a TM domain that anchors Jaw1 in the ER membrane. It was of interest that the full-length Jaw1-translated protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2) partitioned into both the pellet and supernatant, with a slowly migrating full-length form of the protein predominating in the soluble fraction (lane 2), and a faster migrating form of the protein found only in the pellet (lane 1). One potential explanation for this finding was that a processing event occurs upon stable insertion of the Jaw1 protein into microsome membranes. To investigate this we took a biochemical approach. In an initial series of experiments, the cellular organelles of the WEHI 231 mouse B lymphocyte cell line were fractionated over discontinuous sucrose gradients. Following lysis and homogenization of the cells, a postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged over a 0.25/1.3/2.0 sucrose step gradient, and the gradients and interfaces were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4A, lane 1, the postnuclear supernatant contained four major isoforms of Jaw1, designated A, B, C, and D ranging in size from 57 to 69 kDa as noted previously (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, other immunoreactive bands of approximately 42 and 46 kDa were seen. The 0.25 sucrose gradient following centrifugation should contain soluble protein and was enriched for the A isoform of Jaw1 (lane 2). Isoforms B and D, and to a lesser extent the C isoform of Jaw1, were found at interface 2a (lane 7), in the expected migration position of the rough ER (RER). Lane 8 contains (null)/1;10 of the material in lane 7, suggesting that this interface was approximately 10-fold enriched for Jaw1 protein compared with the other gradients and interfaces. Interface 2a was similarly enriched for the RER type I membrane protein ribophorin I (lower panel, Fig. 4A), and this was confirmed by densitometry of both the Jaw1 and ribophorin I blots (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that Jaw1 is expressed as four major protein isoforms (A-D), with the A and, to a lesser extent, the C isoforms preferentially soluble (Fig. 4A, lane 2), whereas the B and D isoforms were enriched in the membrane-bound microsome fraction (lane 7). To investigate the inter-relationship of the various Jaw1 protein isoforms, a pulse-chase immunoprecipitation was performed. Following a 10-min labeling period with [35S]methionine, 38B9 B lymphoid cells were chased with cold methionine, lysed at various time points, and immunoprecipitated with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Jaw1 (13Behrens T.W. Jagadeesh J. Scherle P. Kearns G.M. Yewdell J.W. Staudt L.M. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 682-690PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the processing of isoforms A and C into isoforms B and D, respectively, is clearly demonstrated. This processing event proceeds to completion over a period of 3-4 h (compare with the pattern on Western blot, Fig. 4A, lane 1). A less abundant species of Jaw1 of molecular mass 50 kDa also chases into a smaller isoform of approximately 46 kDa. In experiments not shown, there was no change in the appearance of these bands when the cells were preincubated with tunicamycin, a global inhibitor of glycosylation, and the bands were not sensitive to endoglycosidase H or phosphatases at any time, suggesting that glycosylation or phosphorylation of Jaw1 could not account for the change in mobility. An IVT system was then used to further define the nature of the post-translational modification of Jaw1. Comparison of the full-length mouse and human cDNAs translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates revealed that both cDNAs directed the synthesis of multiple isoforms of Jaw1 (IVT isoforms a-f) (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). The ladder of bands observed are likely internal initiation sites that result from translation beginning at conserved in-frame ATGs present in both mouse and human Jaw1 cDNAs. As such, the complex pattern of IVT proteins represents a fortuitous amino-terminal deletion series. The addition of canine ER microsomes to the Jaw1 IVTs resulted in the appearance of a faster migrating band for each of the translation isoforms (Fig. 6, lane 5, a′-f′), which was reminiscent of the mobility shift observed in the pulse-chase experiment (compare with Fig. 5). From this experiment the processing event could be mapped to the carboxyl terminus, since even the low molecular weight isoforms d-f exhibited the mobility shift. Based on the results shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6, we hypothesized that the shift in mobility observed was due to a proteolytic event that removed the approximately 4-kDa lumenal tail of the protein following insertion into the membrane. As was shown in Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2, a Jaw1 cDNA engineered with a strong translation initiation sequence partitioned into both the pellet (i.e. membrane-associated) and the supernatant (soluble). A close inspection of these two lanes reveals that whereas the soluble protein is entirely full-length (Fig. 3, lane 2), the majority of the membrane-associated protein migrates slightly faster in the gel (Fig. 3, lane 1). This is consistent with a proteolytic event removing the short lumenal domain following membrane insertion of the Jaw1 protein. For subsequent experiments, a Jaw1 IVT template was constructed that deleted the coiled coil region (140 amino acids), provided an optimized translation initiation codon at the 5′ end, and added the FLAG epitope (recognized by the M2 MAb-IBI/Kodak) onto the extreme carboxyl terminus of the protein (Jaw1-FLAG, see Fig. 1B). The internal deletion in this J1-FLAG construct was required in order to unequivocally follow the fate of the processed Jaw1 protein. Ident"

Involucrin expression is tightly linked to the onset of differentiation and first expressed in the immediate suprabasal layers of the epidermis. We have identified a transcriptional response element within the distal 5′-flanking region of the involucrin gene which contributes to differentiation-dependent expression. Deletion of this site impairs differentiation-dependent promoter activity in transient transfection analysis, and conversely, this region imparts differentiation-dependent expression to a heterologous promoter. The identified site bears sequence similarity to several AP2-like response elements identified in keratinocyte-specific genes and binds a protein complex (keratinocyte differentiation factor, KDF-1) which is distinct from AP2 by several criteria. The migration of KDF-1 is distinct from AP2 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, KDF-1 is antigenically unrelated to AP2 since AP2 specific antibodies do not supershift the KDF-1-DNA complex and KDF-1 is poorly competed by oligonucleotides representing consensus AP2 recognition sequences. In addition, the KDF-1 complex is not detected in nuclear extracts derived from human dermal fibroblasts or an enriched population of basal keratinocytes. These findings provide insights to the underlying basis of differentiation-dependent expression of a keratinocyte specific gene.

https://openalex.org/W2018960486,"Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a potent phospholipid mediator which elicits a diverse array of biological actions by interacting with G protein-coupled PAF receptors (PAFR). Binding of PAF to PAFRs leads to activation of G protein(s) that stimulate phosphoinositide phospholipase C and subsequent intracellular signaling responses. To identify the potential role of intracellular domains of the rat PAFR (rPAFR) in signaling, we examined effects of transfecting minigenes encompassing rPAFR intracellular domains 1 (1i), 2 (2i), and 3 (3i) on inositol phosphate (IP) production mediated by the co-transfected rPAFR cDNA. Although transfection of the rPAFR1i and rPAFR2i minigenes had no effects on PAF-stimulated signaling, transfection of the rPAFR3i minigene inhibited PAF-stimulated IP production by approximately 50% compared to controls. The rPAFR3i domain did not inhibit IP production mediated by the multifunctional rat pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide receptor (rPACAPR), demonstrating the specificity of the competition by the rPAFR3i domain. In further experiments, the rPAFR3i domain was engineered onto the homologous domain of a monofunctional transmembrane variant of the rPACAPR (rPACAPR2) that activates only adenylyl cyclase. The rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i chimera responded to PACAP with increases in IP production which were attenuated nearly completely in cells cotransfected with the rPAFR3i domain. In contrast, PACAP had no effects on IP production in a receptor chimera expressing a mutated form of the rPAFR3i domain (rPACAPR2/rPAFR3imut). These results demonstrate the ability of the rPAFR3i domain to confer a phospholipase C-signaling phenotype to a receptor deficient in this activity and show that this activity is specific for the engineered rPAFR3i domain. These results suggest that the third intracellular loop of the rPAFR is a primary determinant in its coupling to phosphoinositide phospholipase C-activating G proteins, providing the first insight into the molecular basis of interaction of PAFRs with signal-transducing G proteins.

PAF is produced from membrane phosphoglycerides, released from a variety of cells, and the most potent lipid mediator yet described (3Snyder F. Am. J.

PAF is a primary mediator of the biological sequelae of anaphylaxis, i.e. thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, plasma extravasation, bronchoconstriction, pulmonary edema, and hypotension, and has been proposed to be a contributing factor in numerous pathophysiological or disease situations including airway hypersensitivity, ischemia-reperfusion injury, septic shock, and renal disease (3Snyder F.

PAF produces its biological effects by interacting with specific receptors, identified and characterized in numerous cells and tissues (9Hwang S-B. J.

In most PAF-responsive cells, binding of PAF to its receptor is accompanied by activation of phosphoinositide phospholipase C. The products of this reaction, inositol trisphophate and diacylglycerol, function as second messengers to promote calcium mobilization and activation of protein kinase C. Indeed, most biological responses to PAF can be attributed to its effects on this signaling pathway (10Chao W. Olson M.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 11Shimizu T. Honda Z. Nakamura M. Bito H. Izumi T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1001-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other signaling systems reportedly regulated by PAF in various cells and tissues include phospholipases A2, phospholipase D, mitogen-activated protein kinase, adenylyl cyclase, and tyrosine kinases (10Chao W.

Numerous studies implicated the involvement of G proteins in PAFR-mediated signaling, however, the first structural evidence that the PAFR was a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily was provided by the cloning of a cDNA encoding the guinea pig lung PAFR by Honda et al. (17Honda Z. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyame Y. Okade H. Toh H. Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) in 1991. Sequence analysis of the cloned PAFR, the first lipid autacoid receptor to be cloned, revealed that the receptor has the seven transmembrane spanning structure characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors. As with other receptors in the G protein-coupled superfamily, it is now clear that PAFR signaling is a consequence of receptor coupling to G proteins. Recent studies indicate that coupling of recombinant PAFRs to phospholipase C is mediated by pertussis toxin-insensitive Gq,11 proteins (16Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J.

Despite the wealth of information implicating PAF in a multitude of physiological and pathophysiological cascades and the cloning of its receptor cDNA from several species (17Honda Z. Nakamura M.

J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the molecular basis of its interaction with G proteins, and hence signaling, is unknown. The present study was initiated to ascertain which intracellular domain(s) of the rPAFR mediates its coupling to phospholipase C-activating G protein(s). We used a combination of minigene expression of intracellular domains of the rPAFR to antagonize PAFR-mediated signaling and a novel gain of function approach using insertional receptor chimerogenesis to demonstrate that the rPAFR3i plays a crucial role in rPAFR signaling. These results provide the first insight into the structural determinants of the PAFR that are involved in its coupling to G proteins. Full-length cDNAs encoding the rPAFR, rPACAPR, and a novel 2T. K. Chatterjee, R. V. Sharma, and R. A. Fisher, manuscript submitted. transmembrane domain 2 variant of the rPACAPR (rPACAPR2) were isolated in our laboratory using a PCR-based strategy essentially as we described (21Chatterjee T.K. Sarkar G. Bolander M. Fisher R.A. Methods in Neuroscience. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Double-stranded sequencing of the cloned rPAFR and rPACAPR cDNAs confirmed their identity to cDNAs isolated by hybridization screening (20Bito H. Honda Z. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Eur. J.

Nature. 1993; 365: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers used for sequencing and PCR were synthesized by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. PAF (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and PACAP-27 were purchased from Bachem. [3H]PAF (1-O-[hexadecyl-1′,2′-3H]) (36 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN and myo-[2-3H]inositol (16.5 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham. LipofectAMINE, Opti-MEM, and inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. AmpliTaq was from Perkin Elmer, Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene, pCRIII vector was obtained from Invitrogen, and Perfect Preps for plasmid DNA preparation were from 5 Prime → 3 Prime Corp., Wizard Prep kits were from Promega. Cell culture medium and serum were obtained from the Diabetes Endocrinology Research Center, the University of Iowa. Other molecular biological reagents were obtained from the University of Iowa DNA Core. BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Pessin, the University of Iowa. A set of minigenes containing cDNA fragments encoding the rPAFR1i, rPAFR2i, and rPAFR3i domains were PCR-amplified from the rPAFR cDNA. The oligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification of these sequences included the sequence 5′-GCCGCCACCATGGGA-3′, representing a consensus ribosomal binding site sequence followed by Met/Gly codons, at the 5′ end of the forward primers and a stop codon at the 3′ end of the reverse primers. The resulting minigene PCR products were cloned following ligation into the eukaryotic expression vector pCRIII. Plasmids with constructs in the proper orientation were reamplified and purified using the Qiagen MaxiPrep Kit. Sequences of both strands of minigenes were confirmed by automated fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. A chimeric cDNA, in which the rPAFR3i domain was engineered into the existing homologous domain of the rPACAPR2, was constructed by PCR. First, the rPAFR3i domain was amplified from the rPAFR cDNA using composite primers incorporating rPACAPR23i sequences at their 5′ ends and rPAFR3i sequences at their 3′ end. This resulted in amplification of a megaprimer which included the rPAFR3i domain with flanking rPACAPR23i sequences at its 5′ and 3′ ends. This 133-base pair megaprimer was used to create overlapping fragments of the rPACAPR2 for subsequent use in a recombinant PCR, a procedure used to join overlapping DNA fragments (21Chatterjee T.K. Sarkar G. Bolander M. Fisher R.A. Methods in Neuroscience. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). To generate the 5′ end of the receptor chimera, PCR was performed using a forward primer encompassing the start codon of the rPACAPR2 and the megaprimer as the reverse primer. Similarly, the 3′ end of the receptor chimera was amplified using the megaprimer as the forward primer and a reverse primer encompassing the stop codon of the rPACAPR2. These two overlapping receptor chimera fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Prep kit and then used in the recombinant PCR. In this reaction, the two overlapping fragments served as template and forward and reverse primers encompassing the rPACAPR2 start codon and stop codon, respectively, were used. The resulting rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i cDNA was cloned into pCRIII. The sequence of both strands of the rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i cDNA was confirmed by automated fluorescent dideoxynucleotide sequencing by the University of Iowa DNA Core Facility. A chimeric cDNA, in which a mutated version of the rPAFR3i domain (rPAFR3imut) was engineered into the existing homologous domain of the rPACAPR2, was constructed by recombinant PCR using rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i cDNA as a template. To generate the 5′ end of the rPACAPR/rPAFR3imut cDNA, PCR was performed using a forward primer encompassing the start codon of the rPACAPR2 and a mutagenic reverse primer. The mutagenic reverse 36-mer (5′-CACTGCCGGTGTGCCCGCCGCCCCCACAGGCCCCAC-3′) encodes for substitution of 8 amino acids within rPAFR3i. Similarly, the 3′ end of the rPACAPR2/rPAFR3imut cDNA was amplified using a mutagenic forward primer and a reverse primer encompassing the stop codon of the rPACAPR2. The mutagenic forward 36-mer (5′-GTGGGGCCTGTGGGGGCGGCGGGCACACCGGCAGTG-3′) encodes for the same rPAFR3i substitutions encoded by the mutagenic reverse 36-mer. These two overlapping rPACAPR2/rPAFR3imut receptor chimera fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR Prep kit and then used in recombinant PCR to generate the full-length chimera. BHK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were plated in 24-well culture dishes at a density of 5-7 × 104 cells/well and allowed to grow for 24 h prior to transfection. For transient transfection of rPAFR minigene cDNAs, cells were transfected with pCRIII containing DNA for the rPAFR (0.8 μg/well) and for the indicated amount (0-2.0 μg/well) of the intracellular domain(s) of the receptor using LipofectAMINE (5 μl/μg DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Empty pCRIII vector was used in place of the minigene cDNA as a control and was added as needed to keep the total amount of DNA/well constant in these experiments. Lipofection was performed for 2 h at 37°C and was terminated by replacing the transfection mixture with culture medium. We found that this 2-h lipofection worked best for transfecting cells with the large amount of DNA (2.8 μg/well) used in these experiments. A longer period of transfection was used for experiments investigating the signaling of rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i and rPACAPR/rPAFR3imut chimeras. For these studies, cells were transfected with pCRIII containing DNA for the rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i, rPACAPR2/rPAFR3imut, rPACAPR2, or rPACAPR (0.5 μg/well) using LipofectAMINE (5 μl/μg DNA). Lipofection was performed for 16 h and terminated as described above. This same protocol was used in experiments examining the specificity of effects of cotransfected rPAFR intracellular domain minigenes on receptor signaling. However, in these experiments cells were first transfected for 16 h with receptor cDNAs prior to a second transfection with the intracellular domain minigene. Thus, cells were transfected for 16 h with pCRIII alone or pCRIII containing DNA for the rPAFR, rPACAPR2/rPAFR3i chimera, or rPACAPR (0.5 μg/well). Then, cells were rinsed and transfected for 4 h with 1.25 μg/well of pCRIII or pCRIII containing the rPAFR3i. Control experiments, to demonstrate that rPAFR-mediated IP production was the same in cells transfected using this transfection protocol (1.25 μg of rPAFR cDNA, 4 h) or the 16 h (0.5 μg rPAFR cDNA) transfection protocol described above, were also performed. For measurement of inositol phosphates (IPs), transfected BHK cells were allowed to recover for 30 h following terminations of transfections then labeled for 16 h with [3H] inositol (2-8 μCi/ml) in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Labeled cells were rinsed with Earle's balanced salt solution, preincubated in Earle's balanced salt solution containing 10 m LiCl for 20 min at 37°C and stimulated with vehicle, PAF, or PACAP-27 for 20 min. Incubations were terminated by removing the medium and adding 1.0 ml of methanol. Total IPs were extracted following addition of chloroform (1.0 ml) and water (0.5 ml) and then separated on Dowex AG1-X8 columns as described by Brown et al. (23Brown E. Kendall D. Nahorski S. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Total IPs were eluted with 1 ammonium formate, 0.1 formic acid. IP accumulation is expressed as disintegrations/min of IPs/105 dpm in the lipid fraction. Binding studies were performed to evaluate possible effects of the rPAFR3i minigene on rPAFR expression. These experiments were performed in 12-well dishes using the 2-h transfection protocol used for transient transfection of rPAFR minigene cDNAs, adjusting the amount of DNA and lipofectamine for twice as many cells. Binding studies were performed 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in 0.4 ml of this same buffer containing 10 n[3H]PAF alone or with various concentrations of unlabeled PAF. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 0-4°C prior to termination of the binding assay by removing the medium, quickly washing the cells three times with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and finally adding 1 ml of 1 NaOH for 30 min to solubilize the cells. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting of the cell lysates following neutralization with 1 ml of 1 HCl. The resulting competition binding data was transformed to a Scatchard plot using a least square regression analysis to determine the number of [3H]PAF binding sites in rPAFR transfectants. Bmax values were normalized on the basis of cell number by counting the number of cells in three individual wells (for each transfection condition) following their trypsinization. Data shown in figures represent means ± S.E. from three transfections assayed in one experiment. Each experiment shown is representative of at least two experiments that provided essentially identical results. The data were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Fisher's post-hoc analysis when multiple comparisons were made. When comparisons involved only two parameters, statistical significance was determined by an independent t test. Minigene constructs encoding the rPAFR1i, rPAFR2i, and rPAFR3i domains were prepared to determine effects of their transient expression on signaling by the rPAFR. Fig. 1A shows the putative membrane topology of the rPAFR identifying these three intracellular domains and their primary sequences. A minigene encoding the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the rPAFR was not prepared in view of recent studies by Takano et al. (24Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Haga T. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that a truncated PAFR lacking this domain was not impaired in its ability to stimulate phosphoinositide phospholipase C or intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. The minigenes encoding these three intracellular domains of the rPAFR were amplified by PCR so that a consensus ribosomal binding site and Met/Gly codons were engineered onto the 5′ cDNA end and a stop codon at the 3′ cDNA end. The resulting constructs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCRIII for expression of the minigene sequence (Fig. 1B). Similar minigene expression systems have been used previously to express intracellular domains of the α-adrenergic, D1 dopamine, and muscarinic receptors (25Luttrell L.M. Ostrowski J. Cotecchia S.

Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pleckstrin homology domains of several proteins (28Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. Touhara K. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12984-12989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine potential role(s) of the three intracellular loops of the rPAFR on rPAFR-mediated intracellular signaling, we cotransfected BHK cells with pCRIII containing cDNAs encoding the rPAFR and the three intracellular domains of the rPAFR. Preliminary experiments showed that untransfected BHK cells do not express endogenous PAF receptors or respond to PAF with phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that the recombinant rPAFR exhibits the characteristic activation of phosphoinositide phospholipase C in response to PAF stimulation. Fig. 2 summarizes effects of PAF on IP accumulation in cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding the rPAFR and rPAFR1i, rPAFR2i, or rPAFR3i domain peptides, alone and in combination. Cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of rPAFR cDNA and 0.67, 1, or 2 μg of the intracellular domain cDNA. Transfection of cells with cDNAs encoding the intracellular domains of the rPAFR had no effects on the basal rate of IP accumulation. However, as shown, rPAFR-mediated IP production in response to a maximally effective concentration of PAF (100 n) was reduced significantly in cells transfected with the rPAFR3i domain minigene but not in cells transfected with cDNAs encoding rPAFR1i or −2i domains. The rPAFR3i domain minigene inhibited rPAFR activity approximately 50% when cotransfected (1.0 or 2.0 μg) individually with the rPAFR cDNA. Transfection of the rPAFR3i domain minigene simultaneously with the rPAFR1i or 2i domain minigenes (1.0 μg each) did not produce more inhibition of rPAFR activity than seen with the rPAFR3i domain alone and cotransfection of the rPAFR1i and −2i domains did not inhibit significantly rPAFR activity. In addition, when a submaximally active amount of the rPAFR3i domain minigene (0.67 μg) was transfected simultaneously with both the rPAFR1i and −2i domains, no significant inhibition of rPAFR activity was seen, as observed with this amount of the rPAFR3i alone. This evidence for inhibition of rPAFR activity by the rPAFR3i domain minigene suggests that this region of the rPAFR is involved in receptor/G protein coupling. In addition, these data do not support a role of the rPAFR1i or −2i in receptor/G protein coupling or for interactions of these domains with the rPAFR3i domain in this coupling. The extent of rPAFR3i-mediated inhibition of rPAFR activity was dependent on the amount of rPAFR3i minigene transfected. Fig. 3 shows that cotransfection of the rPAFR3i minigene with the rPAFR cDNA (0.8 μg) produced dose-dependent reductions in rPAFR-mediated IP production with maximal effects apparent at 1.0 μg of rPAFR3i domain minigene. As shown similarly in Fig. 2, this amount of rPAFR3i minigene produced more than 50% inhibition of rPAFR activity with no further inhibition observed using 2.0 μg of the minigene. The observed attenuation in rPAFR activity by cotransfection of the rPAFR3i minigene could result from a nonspecific effect producing a reduction in the expression of the rPAFR. This seems unlikely, in part, because similar effects were not observed during cotransfection of the rPAFR1i or −2i minigenes. However, to address this possibility, we performed [3H]PAF binding assays in cells cotransfected with rPAFR cDNA and either the rPAFR3i minigene or empty pCRIII vector. Simultaneous transfections were performed in these studies for parallel measurements of rPAFR-mediated IP production to document the inhibitory effect of the rPAFR3i domain on rPAFR activity under the same experimental conditions used to measure expression of the rPAFR. In two separate experiments, cells cotransfected with the rPAFR cDNA and pCRIII vector expressed 210,000 and 220,000 PAF receptors/cell and cells cotransfected with the rPAFR cDNA and the rPAFR3i minigene expressed 200,000 and 230,000 PAF receptors/cell. In contrast to the absence of an effect of the rPAFR3i minigene on rPAFR expression, parallel experiments showed that cells transfected with the rPAFR3i minigene exhibited reductions in PAF-stimulated IP production of 56% (i.e. 672 ± 22% to 293 ± 11%, n = 3) and 49% (509 ± 47% to 258 ± 38%, n = 3) compared to cells transfected with pCRIII alone. These results show that the attenuation of rPAFR activity in cells transfected with the rPAFR3i minigene is not due to alterations in rPAFR expression. To investigate further the role of the rPAFR3i domain in signaling by the rPAFR, we genetically engineered this domain onto a variant of the rPACAPR to create a chimera of this receptor and the rPAFR3i domain. This variant of the rPACAPR, recently identified in our laboratory,2 has been designated rPACAPR2 because it differs from the rPACAPR in discrete sequences located in transmembrane domain 2. However, unlike the multifunctional rPACAPR which activates both adenylyl cyclase and phosphoinositide phospholipase C (22Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J. Seeburg P.H.

https://openalex.org/W2052858521,"We have reported previously that a factor released by elastase treatment of pulmonary fibroblast cultures is capable of down-regulating elastin gene expression. In the present study we have pursued the identification of the factor released by elastase treatment and the characterization of the level of elastin gene expression at which this factor exerts its effect. We have found by immunologic and biochemical procedures that elastase treatment results in the release of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) that is bound within the matrix. Both purified bFGF and bFGF released by elastase from cell matrices decrease the transcriptional level of the elastin gene by 70-80% within 24 h. Transient transfections of pulmonary fibroblasts with a series of elastin promoter deletion constructs show that the region of the elastin gene responsive to bFGF is located within sequences spanning −900 to −200 base pairs. The biological implications of these findings coupled with our previous report are significant, since they demonstrate that elastase digestion of pulmonary fibroblast matrices not only results in the proteolysis of elastin but also results in the release of a potent regulator of elastin gene transcription whose activity can influence repair mechanisms."

Nature. 1985; 317: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Members of the invasin family of proteins are found in a variety of enteropathogens, each of which contributes to the interaction with host cells (15Jerse A.E. Yu J. Tall B.D. Kaper J.B. Proc. Natl.

Invasin is a 986-amino acid outer membrane protein encoded by the inv gene which, when expressed by laboratory strains of Escherichia coli, confers the ability to penetrate cultured cells (14Isberg R.R.

Cell. 1987; 50: 769-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal 192-amino acid region of invasin binds mammalian cells and is necessary and sufficient to promote internalization (18Rankin S. Isberg R. Leong J. Infect.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1979-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).The receptors on the mammalian cell surface to which invasin binds belong to a subset of the integrin superfamily of receptors (20Isberg R.R. Leong J.M. Cell. 1990; 60: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). These receptors are αβ heterodimeric proteins found on the surface of most mammalian cells and are involved in cell-cell interactions as well as adhesion to the extracellular matrix (21Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar). Each of the invasin receptors thus far identified has the β1 chain (20Isberg R.R. Leong J.M.

The site on the integrin receptor that binds invasin appears to be close, or identical, to the site bound by other integrin substrates. Invasin and fibronectin bind to mutually exclusive sites on this receptor, although there is no sequence homology between the two ligands and invasin lacks the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) 3The abbreviations used are: RGDArg-Gly-AspBSAbovine serum albuminMBPmaltose binding proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. sequence shown to be important for binding by fibronectin (17Isberg R.R.

One outstanding difference between these two ligands is that invasin binds to the α5β1 integrin with a much higher affinity than does fibronectin (22Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This tight binding is required for intracellular entry (24Tran Van Nhieu G. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1887-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Several features of the cell binding domain of invasin are important for receptor binding. Mutations that disrupt a 76-amino acid disulfide loop between residues 907 and 982 destroy integrin binding (25Isberg R.R. Tran Van Nhieu G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1994; 27: 395-427Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, residues within an 11-amino acid region encompassing residues 903-913 are also critical for cell binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). One of these residues, aspartate 911 (Asp-911), appears to be absolutely essential for binding, as changes at this position result in complete loss of integrin binding. The extreme sensitivity of this residue to amino acid changes is reminiscent of the aspartate residue of the GRGDS sequence found in the fibronectin repeat III-10 required for cell adhesion (27Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 309: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (2836) Google Scholar, 28Pierschbacher M.D. Hayman E.G. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar).In fibronectin, the repeat III-10 domain containing the RGD sequence is not sufficient to promote levels of adhesivity observed with wild type protein (31Streeter H.B. Rees D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Akiyama S.K. Hasegawa E. Hasegawa T. Yamada K.M. J. Biol.

Pierschbacher M.D. Ruoslahti E. Marguerie G. Plow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3931-3936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences amino-terminal to this domain, in repeat III-9, are also required (35Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This upstream region, called the synergy region, appears to contain critical residues approximately 100 amino acids amino-terminal to the RGD sequence. In this study, we report the analysis of a region of invasin that, like the synergy region of fibronectin, enhances the binding of invasin to its receptor.DISCUSSIONMutational analysis of invasin indicates that only 2 of the 10 aspartate residues in the cell binding domain are critical for integrin binding. One of these, Asp-911, was previously determined to be absolutely required for binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and is unique in that it is the only aspartate absolutely required for adhesion. The second aspartate residue, Asp-811, is identified in this study.Data suggest that Asp-911 directly interacts with its receptor (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this residue does not affect the stability of the protein, and even conservative amino acid changes showed drastic effects on the ability of invasin to bind α5β1. A direct role for Asp-811 interaction with the receptor is more difficult to argue. In contrast to the mutation at Asp-911, mutagenesis of Asp-811 results in a protein with residual binding activity. In addition, unlike the Asp-911 lesion, the mutant protein retained some ability to promote entry into mammalian cells in tissue culture. Although further work needs to be done to determine how these two regions of invasin interact to form an integrin binding site(s), it is interesting to note that the invasin derivative with the 811 region deleted retained some residual binding to purified integrin receptor immobilized on plastic, although it was unable to promote cellular adhesion (data not shown). The aspartate at residue 911 may provide the major contact with the receptor, and the residues in the 811 region may support this primary interaction.Changes of Asp-811 to residues varying in size and charge indicated that an oxygen-containing side chain is required at this site. It is known that divalent cations are required for integrin-ligand interactions (52Phillips D.R. Baughan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Steiner B.

Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and mutations in this residue may alter the binding of divalent cations. Many integrin ligands contain aspartate residues that are critical for binding (21Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that these residues either complex a divalent cation in conjunction with the integrin chains (56Loftus J.C.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or allow displacement of a divalent cation that is involved in maintaining the receptor in a binding-competent conformation. The finding that the diminished activity of MBP-InvD811A can be partially overcome by increased Mg2+ concentration supports the idea that Asp-811 is involved in one of these activities.The identification of Asp-811 as an important residue in integrin binding suggested that additional residues in this region might also be involved. Mutagenesis of six of the flanking amino acids, GQNFATD811K, showed that only Phe-808 is required for receptor binding. A mutation at this site results in a protein with reduced ability to promote cell adhesion. Interestingly, the sequence FATDK that contains both of these critical residues is also found as part of a larger sequence in the Listeria monocytogenes protein internalin that is repeated three times as FAT(D/S)K (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Of note, also, is that replacement of Asp-811 in invasin by serine had no detrimental affect on the protein's ability to promote adhesion to mammalian cells, indicating that aspartate and serine could be interchangeable. Like invasin, internalin is a surface protein that enables L. monocytogenes to invade cultured mammalian cells (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although the receptor for internalin has not been identified, the FATDK sequence may play analogous roles in both proteins.The finding that the region surrounding Asp-811 is critical for cell binding parallels results regarding the binding of fibronectin to its integrin receptors. Although no sequence homology exists between the two ligands, it has been proposed that Asp-911 performs a function equivalent to the aspartate in the RGD sequence of fibronectin (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, our finding that a second region in invasin 100 residues upstream of Asp-911, is involved in α5β1 binding, mimics the involvement of a synergistic site in fibronectin that is also approximately 100 amino acids N-terminal to RGD (35Bowditch R.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins may share similar structural recognition elements in spite of their lack of primary sequence similarity. A functional difference does seem to exist between the identified binding regions of invasin and fibronectin. Studies have shown that each of the binding elements in fibronectin individually retains binding activity and the two together act synergistically (36Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Invasin D911A mutants, however, retain no detectable binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that at least one of these two sites is absolutely required for binding. The residual activity seen with the Asp-811 and Phe-808 mutants, however, suggests that this second region may not be absolutely required for binding. This idea is supported by the finding that MBP-Inv165, which lacks the 811 region entirely, has residual ability to bind purified receptor although this low activity renders it unable to promote cell adhesion (data not shown).Although the results of our alanine scanning mutagenesis do not directly prove that these residues make contact with their receptor, it does implicate their importance in binding. Further high resolution structural analysis of invasin binding should provide more clues to understanding how Phe-808, Asp-811, and Asp-911 interact with α5β1 and elucidate how integrin receptors bind their ligands.

In this study, we report the analysis of a region of invasin that, like the synergy region of fibronectin, enhances the binding of invasin to its receptor. DISCUSSIONMutational analysis of invasin indicates that only 2 of the 10 aspartate residues in the cell binding domain are critical for integrin binding. One of these, Asp-911, was previously determined to be absolutely required for binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and is unique in that it is the only aspartate absolutely required for adhesion. The second aspartate residue, Asp-811, is identified in this study.Data suggest that Asp-911 directly interacts with its receptor (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this residue does not affect the stability of the protein, and even conservative amino acid changes showed drastic effects on the ability of invasin to bind α5β1. A direct role for Asp-811 interaction with the receptor is more difficult to argue. In contrast to the mutation at Asp-911, mutagenesis of Asp-811 results in a protein with residual binding activity. In addition, unlike the Asp-911 lesion, the mutant protein retained some ability to promote entry into mammalian cells in tissue culture. Although further work needs to be done to determine how these two regions of invasin interact to form an integrin binding site(s), it is interesting to note that the invasin derivative with the 811 region deleted retained some residual binding to purified integrin receptor immobilized on plastic, although it was unable to promote cellular adhesion (data not shown). The aspartate at residue 911 may provide the major contact with the receptor, and the residues in the 811 region may support this primary interaction.Changes of Asp-811 to residues varying in size and charge indicated that an oxygen-containing side chain is required at this site. It is known that divalent cations are required for integrin-ligand interactions (52Phillips D.R. Baughan A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10240-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Gailit J. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12927-12932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 54Steiner B.

Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and mutations in this residue may alter the binding of divalent cations. Many integrin ligands contain aspartate residues that are critical for binding (21Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8963) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that these residues either complex a divalent cation in conjunction with the integrin chains (56Loftus J.C.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or allow displacement of a divalent cation that is involved in maintaining the receptor in a binding-competent conformation. The finding that the diminished activity of MBP-InvD811A can be partially overcome by increased Mg2+ concentration supports the idea that Asp-811 is involved in one of these activities.The identification of Asp-811 as an important residue in integrin binding suggested that additional residues in this region might also be involved. Mutagenesis of six of the flanking amino acids, GQNFATD811K, showed that only Phe-808 is required for receptor binding. A mutation at this site results in a protein with reduced ability to promote cell adhesion. Interestingly, the sequence FATDK that contains both of these critical residues is also found as part of a larger sequence in the Listeria monocytogenes protein internalin that is repeated three times as FAT(D/S)K (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Of note, also, is that replacement of Asp-811 in invasin by serine had no detrimental affect on the protein's ability to promote adhesion to mammalian cells, indicating that aspartate and serine could be interchangeable. Like invasin, internalin is a surface protein that enables L. monocytogenes to invade cultured mammalian cells (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although the receptor for internalin has not been identified, the FATDK sequence may play analogous roles in both proteins.The finding that the region surrounding Asp-811 is critical for cell binding parallels results regarding the binding of fibronectin to its integrin receptors. Although no sequence homology exists between the two ligands, it has been proposed that Asp-911 performs a function equivalent to the aspartate in the RGD sequence of fibronectin (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, our finding that a second region in invasin 100 residues upstream of Asp-911, is involved in α5β1 binding, mimics the involvement of a synergistic site in fibronectin that is also approximately 100 amino acids N-terminal to RGD (35Bowditch R.D. Halloran C.E. Aota S. Obara M. Plow E.F. Yamada K.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23323-23328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins may share similar structural recognition elements in spite of their lack of primary sequence similarity. A functional difference does seem to exist between the identified binding regions of invasin and fibronectin. Studies have shown that each of the binding elements in fibronectin individually retains binding activity and the two together act synergistically (36Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Invasin D911A mutants, however, retain no detectable binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that at least one of these two sites is absolutely required for binding. The residual activity seen with the Asp-811 and Phe-808 mutants, however, suggests that this second region may not be absolutely required for binding. This idea is supported by the finding that MBP-Inv165, which lacks the 811 region entirely, has residual ability to bind purified receptor although this low activity renders it unable to promote cell adhesion (data not shown).Although the results of our alanine scanning mutagenesis do not directly prove that these residues make contact with their receptor, it does implicate their importance in binding. Further high resolution structural analysis of invasin binding should provide more clues to understanding how Phe-808, Asp-811, and Asp-911 interact with α5β1 and elucidate how integrin receptors bind their ligands. Mutational analysis of invasin indicates that only 2 of the 10 aspartate residues in the cell binding domain are critical for integrin binding. One of these, Asp-911, was previously determined to be absolutely required for binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and is unique in that it is the only aspartate absolutely required for adhesion. The second aspartate residue, Asp-811, is identified in this study. Data suggest that Asp-911 directly interacts with its receptor (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R.

The finding that the diminished activity of MBP-InvD811A can be partially overcome by increased Mg2+ concentration supports the idea that Asp-811 is involved in one of these activities. The identification of Asp-811 as an important residue in integrin binding suggested that additional residues in this region might also be involved. Mutagenesis of six of the flanking amino acids, GQNFATD811K, showed that only Phe-808 is required for receptor binding. A mutation at this site results in a protein with reduced ability to promote cell adhesion. Interestingly, the sequence FATDK that contains both of these critical residues is also found as part of a larger sequence in the Listeria monocytogenes protein internalin that is repeated three times as FAT(D/S)K (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Of note, also, is that replacement of Asp-811 in invasin by serine had no detrimental affect on the protein's ability to promote adhesion to mammalian cells, indicating that aspartate and serine could be interchangeable. Like invasin, internalin is a surface protein that enables L. monocytogenes to invade cultured mammalian cells (60Gaillard J.-L. Berche P. Frehel C. Gouin E. Cossart P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1127-1141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Although the receptor for internalin has not been identified, the FATDK sequence may play analogous roles in both proteins. The finding that the region surrounding Asp-811 is critical for cell binding parallels results regarding the binding of fibronectin to its integrin receptors. Although no sequence homology exists between the two ligands, it has been proposed that Asp-911 performs a function equivalent to the aspartate in the RGD sequence of fibronectin (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, our finding that a second region in invasin 100 residues upstream of Asp-911, is involved in α5β1 binding, mimics the involvement of a synergistic site in fibronectin that is also approximately 100 amino acids N-terminal to RGD (35Bowditch R.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10856-10863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two proteins may share similar structural recognition elements in spite of their lack of primary sequence similarity. A functional difference does seem to exist between the identified binding regions of invasin and fibronectin. Studies have shown that each of the binding elements in fibronectin individually retains binding activity and the two together act synergistically (36Obara M. Kang M.S. Yamada K.M. Cell. 1988; 53: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Invasin D911A mutants, however, retain no detectable binding (26Leong J.M. Morrissey P.E. Marra A. Isberg R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), indicating that at least one of these two sites is absolutely required for binding. The residual activity seen with the Asp-811 and Phe-808 mutants, however, suggests that this second region may not be absolutely required for binding. This idea is supported by the finding that MBP-Inv165, which lacks the 811 region entirely, has residual ability to bind purified receptor although this low activity renders it unable to promote cell adhesion (data not shown). Although the results of our alanine scanning mutagenesis do not directly prove that these residues make contact with their receptor, it does implicate their importance in binding. Further high resolution structural analysis of invasin binding should provide more clues to understanding how Phe-808, Asp-811, and Asp-911 interact with α5β1 and elucidate how integrin receptors bind their ligands.

INTRODUCTIONSponges have been traditionally used as models to study cell adhesion, since their rather loose and porous extracellular matrix allows a mild cell dissociation and the recovery of intercellular structures in virtually native state. Three basic components were shown to be necessary to aggregate sponge cells (Humphreys, 20Humphreys T. Dev. Biol. 1963; 8: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the cell surface, calcium ions, and an extracellular complex termed aggregation factor. Sponge aggregation factors are proteoglycan-like molecules showing either a linear appearance (Halichondria, Haliclona, Terpios) or a closed, sunburst-like morphology (Microciona, Geodia). Their active participation in species-specific cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Gramzow et al., 14Gramzow M. Schröder H.C. Uhlenbruck G. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) is in contrast to the rather passive mechanical functions generally ascribed to proteoglycans, although growing evidence is accumulating in favor of their relevant role in differentiation and proliferation of cells (Ruoslahti, 48Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Variability in the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans seems to correlate with changes in adhesiveness of the cells to other cells or to the substrate (Sanderson et al., 51Sanderson R.D. Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Lander A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13100-13106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Roughley et al., 47Roughley P.J. White R.J. Magny M.-C. Liu J. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), much in the same way as it has been described for the neural cell-adhesion molecule, where electrostatic interactions between charged glycosaminoglycan chains are thought to modulate the strength of cell-cell interaction (Rothbard et al., 46Rothbard J.B. Brackenbury R. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11064-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variability in the sizes of proteoglycan core proteins has been described as well (Marynen et al., 32Marynen P. Zhang J. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7017-7024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Doege et al., 8Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the physiological relevance of such changes has not yet been explained.The Microciona prolifera aggregation factor (MAF) 1The abbreviations used are: MAFM. prolifera aggregation factorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisRBITCrhodamine B isothiocyanateTFMStrifluoromethanesulfonic acidHFhydrogen fluoridePCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)PNGasepeptide-N-glycosidase. is a Mr = 2 × 107 complex containing roughly equal amounts of protein and carbohydrate (Henkart et al., 18Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; Cauldwell et al., 4Cauldwell C.B. Henkart P. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3051-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MAF-promoted, species-specific sponge cell adhesion involves 1) a Ca2+-dependent MAF self-interaction site, and 2) a Ca2+-independent MAF-cell binding (Jumblatt et al., 22Jumblatt J.E. Schlup V. Burger M.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Highly polyvalent structures have been shown to be involved in both functional domains (Misevic and Burger, 36Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2853-2859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Misevic et al., 40Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions play a central role in MAF self-association activity (Misevic et al., 40Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Misevic and Burger, 38Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carbohydrate groups are involved in specificity (Turner and Burger, 59Turner R.S. Burger M.M. Nature. 1973; 244: 509-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Misevic and Burger, 37Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20577-20584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), at least in the cell binding site, although whether such specificity lies in the glycan structure itself, in the distribution pattern of glycans on the protein backbone, or both, remains unknown. A biological activity for the protein component of MAF, other than being a mere scaffold for the attachment of glycans, is also possible. Specific matrix interactions mediated by proteoglycan core proteins have been demonstrated (Schmidt et al., 53Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glössl J. Nolte V. Hörmann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J.

Nature. 1990; 346: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar), and convincing arguments that biological activity resides in certain proteoglycan core proteins are also appearing (Kjellén and Lindahl, 23Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar; Templeton, 57Templeton D.M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1992; 29: 141-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although progress has been made in unraveling the structure of the glycan moiety of MAF (Misevic and Burger, 37Misevic G.N.

Chem. 1993; 268: 13378-13387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), very limited information is available concerning the protein components. The complexity of sponge cell aggregation is suggested by the finding of many proteins associated with the aggregation factor, among them sialyltransferases (Müller et al., 42Müller W.E.G. Arendes J. Kurelec B. Zahn R.K. Müller I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3836-3842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (Gramzow et al., 15Gramzow M. Zimmermann H. Janetzko A. Dorn A. Kurelec B. Schröder H.C. Müller W.E.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 179: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), calpactin (Robitzki et al., 45Robitzki A. Schröder H.C. Ugarković D. Gramzow M. Fritsche U. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and other bridge proteins that seem to link the factor to the cell membrane receptors (Gramzow et al., 13Gramzow M. Bachmann M. Uhlenbruck G. Dorn A. Müller W.E.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1344-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar; Varner, 60Varner J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3119-3126PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the nature of the main protein component of the aggregation factor core structure has remained elusive.DISCUSSIONThe aggregation factor from the sponge Microciona prolifera is a supramolecular structure containing hyaluronate and several glycosylated proteins. Since major impurities are discarded in the MAF preparation (Henkart et al., 18Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), those components must be held together in the native complex. The ∼210-kDa subunit observed in SDS-PAGE is likely to be the same entity described by Varner et al. (61Varner J.A. Burger M.M. Kaufman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8498-8508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a MAF-binding protein. The MAF complex then could be composed of several interacting units, which might make it difficult to draw the limits between what belongs to the factor and what associates with it. The presence of noncovalent bonds has been confirmed by PAGE and dissociative gradient results. Two proteins have been found to be associated with glycosaminoglycan-containing bands, but chemical deglycosylation revealed the presence of a distinct major protein component.Electron microscopy (Humphreys et al., 21Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Sano J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and atomic force microscope studies (Dammer et al., 6Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Güntherodt H.-J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) have shown that MAF has a sunburst-like structure, with a central ring of about 200 nm across and radiating arms, each 180 nm long. MAF-MAF self-binding has been found to be the result of carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (Misevic and Burger, 38Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, since two MAF molecules seem to bind through their arms (Dammer et al., 6Dammer U. Popescu O. Wagner P. Anselmetti D. Güntherodt H.-J. Misevic G.N. Science. 1995; 267: 1173-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), these might be enriched in carbohydrate, leaving for the ring most of the protein. Urea, SDS, or mercaptoethanol have little effect on MAF as long as Ca2+ is present (Cauldwell et al., 4Cauldwell C.B. Henkart P. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3051-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Humphreys et al. (21Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Sano J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1977; 7: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) described that the aggregation factor was stable in 0.5% SDS, and only after 4 weeks of incubation in the presence of EDTA were all the arms dissociated, although the central ring, containing protein and polysaccharide, remained unaltered even after further treatment with SDS, dithiothreitol, and heating for 5 min at 100°C. Only a drastic 4-h treatment at 80°C in 40 m EDTA and 5 urea was able to fragment about 60-80% of MAF in fractions entering a separating gel, with still as much as 20-40% retained by the stacking gel (Misevic et al., 39Misevic G.N. Jumblatt J.E. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6931-6936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that chemical deglycosylation disrupted the aggregated material observed in SDS-PAGE, suggesting that glycosaminoglycan chains play a crucial role in maintaining MAF structure. This idea is strongly supported by the result of the brief HF deglycosylation shown in Fig. 2B, which demonstrates that MAFp3 units, otherwise so difficult to isolate, begin to be released immediately after glycan chopping off starts. Covalent link between proteins through glycosaminoglycan chains has already been described (Enghild et al., 11Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Thøgersen I.B. Valnickova Z. Pizzo S.V. Hefta S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8711-8716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but we have no proof of such a bond existing in sponges. On the other hand, the high negative charge of MAF (Henkart et al., 18Henkart P. Humphreys S. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3045-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) might hamper the interaction with other negatively charged molecules like EDTA and SDS, thus limiting their disruptive effects. In such situations, Ca2+ ions buried within MAF could be protected enough to form relatively stable ionic bonds with the abundant acid residues from MAF glycosaminoglycans and/or proteins, helping to stabilize the overall structure. In agreement with this hypothesis, two distinct groups of Ca2+-binding sites have been found in MAF, which might be related to the requirement of low Ca2+ concentrations to maintain the subunit organization of the aggregation factor complex and of higher Ca2+ concentrations for the factor to keep cells together (Cauldwell et al., 4Cauldwell C.B. Henkart P. Humphreys T. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3051-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).The presence of putative N- and O-glycosylation sites, PNGase F digestion data, and alkaline β-elimination results suggest that MAFp3 contains both N- and O-linked glycans, although its localization in an intermediate fraction of dissociative guanidinium hydrochloride/cesium chloride density gradients indicates a moderate degree of glycosylation. The carboxyl-terminal GSGLGSGIG (positions 293-301) closely resembles sequences found in rat serglycin (Bourdon et al., 2Bourdon M.A. Shiga M. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12534-12537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), syndecan (Saunders et al., 52Saunders S. Jalkanen M. O'Farrell S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), human fibroglycan (Marynen et al., 32Marynen P. Zhang J. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7017-7024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in glypican (David et al., 7David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar; Fig. 5A). Two glutamate residues in positions −5 and −6 complete a good consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan attachment (Bourdon et al., 3Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). MAFp3 does not contain sequences, like RGD, often found in adhesive proteins (Kreis and Vale, 26Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar), thus leaving open the question whether the protein moiety of MAF participates actively in the binding of the factor or only carbohydrate structures are involved in the recognition process.We have found 30% identity between the region enclosed by residues −149 and −16 from the sequence shown in Fig. 3 and the cytoplasmic domain of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Fig. 5B), a membrane protein responsible for the maintenance of low intracellular Ca2+ levels. Canine and rat isoforms of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger exhibit for the same region a mere 51% identity (Nicoll et al., 43Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar; Li et al., 29Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which makes the similitude with the sponge sequence even more striking. We regard this homology as most suggestive since, besides the classical secretory vesicle pathway, an alternative route to export MAFp3 to the extracellular matrix could be its synthesis as a larger polypeptide together with a protein targeted to the membrane, to be cleaved afterward. The deglycosylation results shown in Fig. 2A have been regularly reproduced with aggregation factor isolated in all seasons from pools of several individuals, without ever detecting any other amino-terminal or deglycosylation products different from those presented under “Results,” thus ruling out the existence of a longer MAFp3 variety that could be incorporated in the factor under certain conditions. Although the structure-function relationship of MAFp3 for sponge cell adhesion remains to be investigated, regulation of its expression might be related to the yearly life cycle (sexual and asexual reproduction, budding, repair after injury), environmental changes (temperature, light, salinity), or both. During winter, the sponge body degenerates and in spring it will grow again from groups of dormant cells. Since most of the physiological uproar takes place in spring and summer, a correlation between phenomena such as gemmulation, release of larvae or sperm cells, and the adhesiveness of the sponge tissue is to be expected. Our results showing clear differences in MAFp3 expression during this physiologically active period point in that direction.Whether the several bands identified in Southern blots represent different forms of MAFp3 or other related proteins is currently under investigation in our laboratory. The variety of products observed after chemical deglycosylation of MAF is most likely the result of an incomplete removal of glycosaminoglycan chains, although the possibility of the existence of several MAFp3 forms sharing the same amino terminus should not be ruled out. Considering the protein content of MAF, between 250 and 300 MAFp3 units are expected to be found in a single molecule of aggregation factor. This is the number of pyruvate epitopes suggested to be present in each molecule (Spillmann et al., 55Spillmann D. Hård K. Thomas-Oates J. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Misevic G. Burger M.M. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13378-13387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although this might be an underestimation due to the acid lability of the pyruvate group, which makes it sensitive to the hydrolysis conditions used for its preparation. If the three putative N-glycosylation sites in each MAFp3 molecule were substituted, that would give about 900 pyruvate epitopes per MAF molecule, a value very close to the 1100 sites suggested by Block 1 antibody binding assays (Misevic et al., 40Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PNGase F digestion releases a repetitive glycan from MAF, termed G-6, which should be represented about 950 times, and contains the cell binding site of MAF (Misevic and Burger, 37Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20577-20584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since Block 1 antibody binds to G-6 (Misevic, 35Misevic G.N. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Misevic and Burger, 38Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4922-4929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to suggest that MAFp3 carries G-6 and, therefore, the pyruvate epitope that would be involved in the cell binding.Highly polyvalent carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions have been shown to mediate sponge cell aggregation. Our finding that the main protein of MAF is a relatively small 35-kDa molecule suggests that polyvalency at the protein level might also exist. Highly glycosylated proteoglycans consist of repeated sites in a large protein chain to which glycosaminoglycan substituents are attached. In the sponge aggregation factor, the whole protein itself seems to be the repeating unit, and its polymerization can bring along the carbohydrate polyvalency required for sponge cell aggregation. Yeast agglutinins are cell adhesion molecules sharing many characteristics with the sponge system; the high binding affinity of the sexual agglutination factor from Hansenula wingei was found to be the result of the additive effect of several of the individual binding sites, located on protein subunits interconnected through disulfide bonds (Taylor and Orton, 56Taylor N.W. Orton W.L. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; Yen and Ballou, 66Yen P.H. Ballou C.E.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae a-agglutinin analogs are highly glycosylated disulfide-linked oligomers, containing a large core subunit mediating cell surface attachment and a small self-binding subunit, the total molecular weight being about 106 (Lipke and Kurjan, 30Lipke P.N. Kurjan J. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 180-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In reducing conditions, we have not detected any measurable decrease of MAF-mediated aggregation efficiency of sponge cells, although monomerization of the protein might be overcome by the existence of several active carbohydrate binding units on each single MAFp3, thus suggesting again the existence of strong interactions between glycosaminoglycan chains. Moreover, the presence of hyaluronate in the aggregation factor preparation suggests that binding of MAFp3 to hyaluronic acid might also occur. MAFp3 contains a cluster of basic amino acids (RRYRNRVR, residues 107-114), which could determine the attachment to hyaluronate (Hardingham et al., 17Hardingham T.E. Ewins R.J.F. Muir H. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar; Lyon, 31Lyon M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This sequence resembles the hyaluronan binding motif B(X7)B, where B is either arginine or lysine and X is any nonacidic amino acid (Yang et al., 65Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). We have observed that the addition of exogenous hyaluronate to aggregation factor preparations with low activity raised the aggregation efficiency of the factor to equal that found in the most active preparations. Our data indicating (i) that the main protein from the 2 × 104-kDa sponge aggregation factor is a relatively small 35-kDa molecule and (ii) the presence on MAFp3 of carbohydrate structures involved in the aggregation activity, suggest that the cooperative effect of multiple low affinity interactions required for MAF-mediated sponge cell aggregation might be based on the cross-linking of a small glycosylated protein into a large polymer, where the active carbohydrate sites would be correctly exposed. INTRODUCTIONSponges have been traditionally used as models to study cell adhesion, since their rather loose and porous extracellular matrix allows a mild cell dissociation and the recovery of intercellular structures in virtually native state. Three basic components were shown to be necessary to aggregate sponge cells (Humphreys, 20Humphreys T. Dev. Biol. 1963; 8: 27-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the cell surface, calcium ions, and an extracellular complex termed aggregation factor. Sponge aggregation factors are proteoglycan-like molecules showing either a linear appearance (Halichondria, Haliclona, Terpios) or a closed, sunburst-like morphology (Microciona, Geodia). Their active participation in species-specific cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (Gramzow et al., 14Gramzow M. Schröder H.C. Uhlenbruck G. Batel R. Müller W.E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) is in contrast to the rather passive mechanical functions generally ascribed to proteoglycans, although growing evidence is accumulating in favor of their relevant role in differentiation and proliferation of cells (Ruoslahti, 48Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 229-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Variability in the glycosaminoglycan moiety of proteoglycans seems to correlate with changes in adhesiveness of the cells to other cells or to the substrate (Sanderson et al., 51Sanderson R.D.

Brackenbury R. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11064-11069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variability in the sizes of proteoglycan core proteins has been described as well (Marynen et al., 32Marynen P. Zhang J. Cassiman J.-J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3051-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). MAF-promoted, species-specific sponge cell adhesion involves 1) a Ca2+-dependent MAF self-interaction site, and 2) a Ca2+-independent MAF-cell binding (Jumblatt et al., 22Jumblatt J.E. Schlup V. Burger M.M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Highly polyvalent structures have been shown to be involved in both functional domains (Misevic and Burger, 36Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions play a central role in MAF self-association activity (Misevic et al., 40Misevic G.N. Finne J. Burger M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5870-5877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Misevic and Burger, 38Misevic G.N. Burger M.M. J. Biol.

A biological activity for the protein component of MAF, other than being a mere scaffold for the attachment of glycans, is also possible. Specific matrix interactions mediated by proteoglycan core proteins have been demonstrated (Schmidt et al., 53Schmidt G. Robenek H. Harrach B. Glössl J. Nolte V. Hörmann H. Richter H. Kresse H. J.

The complexity of sponge cell aggregation is suggested by the finding of many proteins associated with the aggregation factor, among them sialyltransferases (Müller et al., 42Müller W.E.G. Arendes J. Kurelec B. Zahn R.K. Müller I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3836-3842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (Gramzow et al., 15Gramzow M. Zimmermann H. Janetzko A. Dorn A.

Nevertheless, the nature of the main protein component of the aggregation factor core structure has remained elusive."

The PAF receptor is a member of the seven-transmembrane GTP-binding regulatory protein-coupled receptor superfamily. This receptor binds PAF with high affinity and couples to multiple signaling pathways, leading to physiological responses that can be inhibited by various structurally distinct PAF antagonists. We have used site-directed mutagenesis and functional expression studies to examine the role of the Phe97 and Phe98 residues located in the third transmembrane helix and Asn285 and Asp289 of the seventh transmembrane helix in ligand binding and activation of the human PAF receptor in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. The double mutant FFGG (Phe97 and Phe98 mutated into Gly residues) showed a 3-4-fold decrease in affinity for PAF, but not for the specific antagonist WEB2086, when compared with the wild-type (WT) receptor. The FFGG mutant receptor, however, displayed normal agonist activation, suggesting that these two adjacent Phe residues maintain the native PAF receptor conformation rather than interacting with the ligand. On the other hand, substitution of Ala for Asp289 increased the receptor affinity for PAF but abolished PAF-dependent inositol phosphate accumulation; it did not affect WEB2086 binding. Substitution of Asn for Asp289, however, resulted in a mutant receptor with normal binding and activation characteristics. When Asn285 was mutated to Ala, the resulting receptor was undistinguishable from the WT receptor. Surprisingly, substitution of Ile for Asn285 led to a loss of ligand binding despite normal cell surface expression levels of this mutant, as verified by flow cytometric analysis. Our data suggest that residues 285 and 289 are determinant in the structure and activation of the PAF receptor but not in direct ligand binding, as had been recently proposed in a PAF receptor molecular model.

The PAF structural requirement is highly specific for its biological actions, which are mediated through binding and activation of a specific, high-affinity receptor on the target cell surface.

The recent cloning of the PAF receptor has made possible the study of the structure-function relationship of this receptor, but little information has been published as yet. The cytoplasmic tail of the guinea pig PAF receptor has been shown not to be required for the forward signal transduction to multiple pathways but to play an essential role in the agonist-induced desensitization (17Takano T. Honda Z. Sakanaka C. Izumi T. Kameyama K. Haga K. Kurokawa K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22453-22458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the human PAF receptor contains a single N-linked consensus glycosylation sequence in the putative second extracellular loop (7Kunz D. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9101-9106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to the guinea pig (18Honda Z.I. Nakamura M. Miki I. Minami M. Watanabe T. Seyama Y. Okado H. Toh Ito K. Miyamoto T. Shimizu T. Nature. 1991; 349: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and the rat (19Bito H. Honda Z. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) receptors, which have an additional NH2-terminal consensus sequence for N-glycosylation. In this context, Streptococcus pneumoniae was recently shown to use the human PAF receptor for adherence to and invasion of host cells (20Cundell D.R. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Idanpaan-Helkkila I. Tuomanen E.I. Nature. 1995; 377: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). It was later shown that this N-glycosylation site enhances bacterial binding to the PAF receptor but is not required for the interaction (21Rodriguez C.G. Cundell D.R. Tuomanen E.I. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Gerard C. Gerard N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25178-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glycosylation at this site is necessary for efficient membrane trafficking of the PAF receptor but seems to have no role in receptor affinity and activation (21Rodriguez C.G. Cundell D.R.

In additional structural studies, we have demonstrated that mutation of two adjacent residues, Ala230 and Leu231, in the COOH-terminal region of the third intracellular loop led respectively to inactive and constitutively active phenotypes of the PAF receptor (22Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that the highly conserved Asp63 residue in the second transmembrane helix is not involved in ligand binding but is necessary for G protein coupling of the human PAF receptor (23Parent J.L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, a molecular model of the PAF receptor was proposed based on the bacteriorhodopsin three-dimensional structure (24Kajihara A. Komooka H. Kamiya K. Yoneda T. Yoneda S. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Umeyama H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, the side chains of Asp63, Asn285, and Asp289 were adjacent to each other and oriented toward the central core of the receptor. These three residues were thought to form a negatively charged site that would attract the positively charged choline moiety of the PAF molecule by electrostatic forces. Conserved Asp residues in the third TMH, which were shown to participate in hydrophilic ligand interactions for other G protein-coupled receptors (25Svarese T. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), are absent in the corresponding domain of the PAF receptor. Instead, two hydrophobic residues, Phe97 and Phe98, are similarly located, which could possibly interact with the acetyl group or the phospholipid chain of the PAF molecule. No experimental data are yet available on residues that might be part of the binding pocket of the PAF receptor. To address this question, we mutated the Phe97, Phe98, Asn285, and Asp289 residues of the PAF receptor, and properties of these mutants were compared with those of the wild-type (WT) PAF receptor in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. In this report, we suggest that the Phe97 and Phe98 residues may be involved in maintaining the native conformation of the PAF receptor and, moreover, that the PAF molecule does not bind to the Asn285 and Asp289 residues, contrary to what had been proposed (24Kajihara A. Komooka H. Kamiya K. Yoneda T. Yoneda S. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Umeyama H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar). However, the two latter amino acids could be determinant in receptor conformation and activation. The PAF receptor cDNA derived from Kp132 (a generous gift from Dr. Richard Ye, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) (8Ye R.D. Prossnitz E.R. Zou A. Cochrane C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pRc-cytomegalovirus expression vector (Invitrogen). Mutated receptors were constructed by polymerase chain reaction (26Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninski J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177Google Scholar) using Kp132 as a template. To create the FFGG double mutant, we made the oligonucleotide 5′-GTGGCTGGCTGCCTTGGCGGCATCAACACCTAC-3′ and its reverse complement, which changes TTC (Phe) to GGC (Gly). Similarly, to mutate the Asn285 to Ala and Ile, we generated the oligonucleotides 5′-CCTTAGCACCGCCTGTGTCTTAG-3′ and 5′-CCTTAGCACCATCTGTGTCTTAG-3′ and their reverse complements, respectively, changing AAC (Asn) to GCC (Ala) and ATC (Ile). To substitute Ala and Asn for Asp289, the following oligonucleotides and their reverse complements were used: 5′-GTCTCTTAGCGCCTGTTATC-3′ and 5′-GTCTCTTAAACCCTGTTATC-3′, mutating GAC (Asp) to GCG (Ala) and AAC (Asn), respectively. The FFGG double mutant polymerase chain reaction product was digested with HindIII-MScI, whereas polymerase chain reaction products for the Asn285 and Asp289 mutants were digested with BstEII-XbaI and subcloned into pRc-cytomegalovirus containing the WT receptor cDNA digested with the same enzymes, respectively. The region corresponding to the subcloned polymerase chain reaction fragments was sequenced on both strands by dideoxy sequencing of double-stranded DNA with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated in 30-mm dishes (1.5 × 105 cells/dish), transiently transfected with the constructions encoding the WT and mutant receptors using 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μg of DNA/dish, and harvested 48 h after transfection. Competition binding curves were done on COS-7 cells expressing the wild-type and mutant receptor species. Cells were harvested and washed twice in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (140 m NaCl, 2.7 m KCl, 1 m CaCl2, 12 m NaHCO3, 5.6 m -glucose, 0.49 m MgCl2, 0.37 m NaH2PO4, and 25 m Hepes pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (13Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions were carried out on 5 × 104 cells in a total volume of 0.25 ml in the same buffer with 10 n [3H]WEB2086 (DuPont NEN) and increasing concentrations of nonradioactive WEB2086 or PAF for 90 min at 25°C. Reactions were stopped by centrifugation. The cell-associated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation. Binding reactions involving [3H]PAF (4 n) were performed on intact adherent COS-7 cells in a total volume of 600 μl of binding buffer containing 150 m choline chloride, 10 m Tris-HCl, 10 m MgCl2, pH 7.5, and 0.25% lipid-free bovine serum albumin (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Cells were washed four times with ice-cold buffer (1 ml), lysed with 0.1 NaOH, and analyzed for radioactivity (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were transfected as described above with the wild-type or mutant receptors and labeled the following day for 18-24 h with [3H]myo-inositol (Amersham Corp.) at 5 μCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol; Life Technologies). After labeling, cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and preincubated for 5 min in PBS at 37°C. At the end of this preincubation period, the PBS was removed, and cells were incubated in prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) containing 20 m LiCl for 5 min. Cells were then stimulated for 30 s with indicated concentrations of PAF. The reactions were terminated with the addition of perchloric acid followed by a 30-min incubation on ice. Inositol phosphates were extracted (28Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated on Dowex AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad) columns (29Berridge M.T. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Hyslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar). Total labeled inositol phosphates were then counted by liquid scintillation. The N285I and WT receptors were subcloned in frame with the c-myc epitope in the pJ3M vector, kindly provided by Dr. J. Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) (30Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pJ3M-c-myc N285I and pJ3M-c-myc WT receptor constructs were transfected in COS-7 cells, which were harvested 48 h after transfection and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Cells (2.5 × 105) were washed twice in PBS and labeled with or without anti-c-myc antibody (9E10 hybridoma; American Type Culture Collection) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated at room temperature for an additional 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio/Can). All measures were performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). To determine residues that might contribute to ligand binding and receptor activation of the human PAF receptor, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the Phe97, Phe98, Asn285, and Asp289 residues and evaluated the properties of the mutant receptors in comparison with the WT PAF receptor in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Fig. 1 shows a representation of the putative seven membrane-spanning domain topography of the PAF receptor and indicates the amino acids that were replaced in the mutant receptors. Binding characteristics of the WT and mutant receptors are summarized in Table I. Fig. 2 shows that the affinity of the specific PAF receptor antagonist WEB2086 for the indicated mutant receptors was unaltered compared with the WT receptor in competition binding experiments. Calculated receptor densities (Bmax), indicated as receptors per cell, were also similar for the different receptors, except for the N285I mutant (Table I). As is well known, PAF being a phospholipid, binding experiments using [3H]PAF constitute a large nonspecific component that renders reproducibility and interpretation of the results difficult (27Ali H. Richardson R.M. Tomhave E.D. DuBose R.A. Haribabu B. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24557-24563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the affinity of the antagonist was the same for all the receptors, we used competition of [3H]WEB2086 by cold PAF to assess the PAF affinity for the different receptors and obtained high reproducibility between experiments. Fig. 3A shows the competition binding isotherms of [3H]WEB2086 by PAF for the indicated receptors. The WT receptor displayed a Ki of 33 ± 4.6 n for PAF, whereas the N285A and D289N mutants had corresponding values of 31 ± 4.1 and 34 ± 3.1 n, respectively. Surprisingly, the N285I mutant did not display any specific WEB2086 or PAF binding. No significant specific binding above the control level (vector-transfected cells) could be detected for this mutant in every single experiment (n = 4). A 3-fold higher affinity for PAF than the WT receptor was displayed by the D289A mutant receptor, which had a Ki of 12 ± 2.3 n. In contrast, the FFGG mutant receptor had almost a three-fold lower affinity for PAF, with a Ki of 87 ± 5.7 n. As these results indirectly assess PAF binding by displacing the [3H]WEB2086 probe, we then performed direct studies of PAF binding to further support our conclusions. Fig. 3B illustrates competition binding isotherms of PAF to the different receptors. As summarized in Table I, conclusions that can be drawn by the direct PAF binding studies are essentially the same as those from the displacement of [3H]WEB2086. The WT, N285A, and D289N receptors displayed the same affinity for PAF, with respective Ki values of 12 ± 2.7, 9.8 ± 2.4, and 12.7 ± 3.1 n. A 4-fold higher affinity for PAF than the WT receptor was displayed by the D289A mutant, whereas the FFGG double mutant showed approximately a 4-fold lower affinity for PAF than the WT receptor (Table I).Table I.Ligand binding and activation parameters of the wild-type and mutant receptorsReceptorBmaxWEB2086 Ki[3H]WEB + PAF PAF Ki[3H]PAF + PAF PAF KiEC50Wild-type802 500 ± 161 04130 ± 2.133 ± 4.612 ± 2.78.0 ± 1.2FFGG mutant712 640 ± 214 71839 ± 2.787 ± 5.749 ± 6.97.8 ± 0.9N285A mutant691 725 ± 143 24621 ± 1.931 ± 4.19.8 ± 2.411 ± 2.1N285I mutantNDaND, not detectable.NDNDNDD289A mutant762 484 ± 189 46523 ± 2.012 ± 2.32.9 ± 0.9D289N mutant911 071 ± 231 46534 ± 3.134 ± 3.112.7 ± 3.16.5 ± 0.7a ND, not detectable.

The results are representative of three independent experiments, the mean ± S.E. values of which are reported in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ability of the mutant receptors to transduce a signal was then tested by measuring IP accumulation following stimulation with graded concentrations of PAF. Fig. 4 illustrates the concentration-response curves of IP accumulation for the WT and mutant receptors in response to PAF concentrations from 0 to 10−6. PAF concentrations higher than 10−6 were not used, as PAF has been shown to have nonreceptor-mediated effects at these concentrations (31Sawyer D.B. Andersen O.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), making the interpretation of results difficult. No significant difference could be detected between the activation of the FFGG, N285A, D289N, and WT receptors, in which IP production reached a plateau at 10−7 of agonist with similar half-maximal effective concentration values (Table I). No IPs were produced by the N285I and D289A mutants over the entire range of PAF concentrations. To verify whether the phenotype observed for the N285I mutant receptor was caused by decreased cell surface expression, N285I and WT receptors were tagged with a c-myc epitope (30Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and used to transfect COS-7 cells, which were then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The tagged receptors conserved their respective binding parameters (data not shown). Fig. 5 demonstrates that both the tagged WT and N285I mutant receptors were equally well expressed at the cell surface with ∼30% of cells displaying receptors with similar fluorescence intensity, indicating that the loss of activation and ligand binding of the N285I mutant receptor was not due to an absence of cell surface expression. PAF has numerous biological activities and stimulates multiple signaling pathways through its specific G protein-coupled receptor (13Honda Z. Takano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Ito K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2307-2315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The PAF receptor was the first G protein-coupled receptor for a lipid ligand to be cloned, and, to our knowledge, no experimental data have yet been published on residues that might be involved in lipid ligand interaction with this receptor superfamily. We have previously shown that the highly conserved Asp63 residue in the second transmembrane domain of the PAF receptor was not involved in direct binding of either the antagonist WEB2086 or PAF. The mutation of this residue to Asn increased affinity specifically for PAF but abolished G protein coupling (23Parent J.L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our group has also demonstrated that the receptor affinity for PAF could be affected by mutations in the COOH-terminal region of the third intracellular loop of the PAF receptor (22Parent J.-L. Le Gouill C. de Brum-Fernandes A.J. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7949-7955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present report, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to study the possible involvement of the transmembrane residues Phe97, Phe98, Asn285, and Asp289 in ligand binding and activation of the human PAF receptor. A conserved Asp residue is found in the third TMH of several G protein-coupled receptors and has been shown to participate in binding hydrophilic ligands such as the cationic neurotransmitters adrenaline, acetylcholine, dopamine, and serotonin (25Svarese T. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which are reminiscent of the positively charged PAF choline moiety. Asp residues are absent, however, from the third TMH of the PAF receptor. Thus, we mutated the two adjacent Phe residues (Phe97 and Phe98) of the third TMH into Gly residues (FFGG double mutant) to verify whether those hydrophobic amino acids, positioned at the locus of the conserved Asp residue mentioned above, were involved in ligand binding, possibly through interaction with the acetyl group or the phospholipid chain of the PAF molecule. Our results showed that the Phe97 and Phe98 residues have no role in WEB2086 binding but, when mutated, produced a 3-4-fold decrease in affinity for PAF. This change in affinity more likely reflects an increased flexibility and, consequently, a slight conformational change of the PAF receptor rather than a modification of direct interaction of these two hydrophobic residues with the PAF molecule. This is supported by the fact that the FFGG mutant produced the same level of IPs as the WT receptor following PAF binding. It has been shown that even a small modification of either the phospholipid chain, the acetyl group, or the phosphocholine moiety of the PAF molecule resulted in considerable loss of its biological activity (2Braquet P. Touqui L. Shen T.Y. Vargaftig B.B. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 97-145PubMed Google Scholar). If the Phe residues were to interact with any of the chemical groups of the PAF molecule, then the FFGG mutant activation would be significantly affected. The change in agonist affinity could be caused by the substituting Gly residues, the higher degree of freedom of movement of the third TMH, or the disappearance of hydrophobic interactions in the FFGG mutant with other residues of the receptor or with the membrane. Since the double mutant displayed only a small decrease in PAF, but not in WEB2086 affinity, these two hydrophobic residues seem to be involved in maintaining the PAF receptor in its optimal conformation. These results also suggest that the agonist and antagonist are not sensitive to the same structural variation of the receptor. An Asn residue, corresponding to position 289 of the PAF receptor, is found conserved in 95% of all G protein-coupled receptors (32Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). However, the PAF receptor has an Asp residue at that position, which we substituted by its isoster, Asn (D289N mutant), to ascertain whether the negative charge of the Asp289 residue could interact with the positive charge of the PAF molecule and to study the effects of converting this residue back to the 95% conserved amino acid at this locus. In addition, the Asp289 amino acid was mutated to Ala to study the potential involvement of residue 289 in forming hydrogen bonds, which might contribute to the structure and function of this receptor. Substitution of Asn for Asp289 resulted in identical binding and activation characteristics between the WT and the mutant receptors. Asp, which carries a negative charge, was replaced with Asn, an amino acid similar in size but possessing no net charge, with the rationale that this mutation would allow for assessment of the role of the negatively charged Asp at this locus. The data obtained indicate that genetic selective pressure did not introduce the Asp289 at this position, instead of the 95% conserved Asn residue, to interact with the PAF receptor ligands; contrary to what had been proposed (24Kajihara A. Komooka H. Kamiya K. Yoneda T. Yoneda S. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Umeyama H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar), the negative charge of Asp289 does not seem to be required for attracting and docking the positive charge of the PAF choline moiety. The D289A mutant displayed normal WEB2086 binding parameters but showed an increased affinity for PAF and was unable to accumulate IPs following agonist stimulation. These results suggest that the residue found at position 289 is of no apparent importance in ligand binding but is critical for signal transduction. It may indicate that, although possible hydrogen bonds formed between the side chain functionalities of Asn or Asp residues at this locus with other amino acids of the PAF receptor are not important for ligand binding, such interactions could be necessary for appropriate receptor conformation and transition from the inactive to the active form, leading to IP accumulation. Other G protein-coupled receptors, such as the thrombin, thromboxane A2, and choriogonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors, have an Asp at this locus (32Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In the choriogonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, it was suggested that this amino acid maintained the receptor structure by forming hydrogen bonds with an Asn residue in the second TMH (33Zhou W. Flanagan C. Ballesteros J.A. Konvicka K. Davidson J.S. Weinstein H. Millar R.P. Sealfon S.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 165-170PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, no particular function has been attributed to the cognate Asp residues of the thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors as yet. In the β2 adrenergic receptor, Asn318, which corresponds to Asn285 in the seventh TMH of the PAF receptor, is presumed to interact with β2 agonists (34Strader C.D. Sigal I.S. Register S.B. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Dixon R.A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Therefore, we substituted Ile and Ala residues for Asn285 (N285I and N285A mutants) to study its potential role in PAF receptor biology. The substitution of an Ala for Asn285 showed that the presence of Asn at this position is not required for ligand binding, the maintenance of the optimal conformation, or the activation of the PAF receptor. These data may also indicate that Asn285 is not forming essential hydrogen bonds with other amino acids of the receptor. However, mutation of Asn285 to Ile surprisingly led to an apparent complete loss of ligand binding despite normal cell surface expression of the mutant receptor, as judged by flow cytometric analysis. It seems, with the results obtained, that the residue found at position 285 could influence receptor conformation, although it would not be involved in direct ligand binding. To explain the differences between the N285A and N285I phenotypes, we might speculate that mutation of Asn285 to Ala would not alter the PAF receptor structure-function relationship, because both amino acids have small sizes, in contrast to Ile, which is more hydrophobic and bulky, with β branching in its side chain. The Ile residue could modify the structure of the seventh TMH and/or impair the interaction of this TMH with other transmembrane domains of the PAF receptor, leading to a distortion of the receptor molecule that could prevent docking of the ligand into the binding pocket. Further experiments will be necessary to delineate the exact role of residue 285 in PAF receptor biology. It will be interesting to examine the reactivity of PAF receptor mutants to a range of PAF receptor agonists and antagonists. In this context, preliminary data suggest that the WT, FFGG, and D289A receptors display the same affinity for the gingkolide antagonist BN52021. In contrast, binding studies revealed that the D289A mutant had a 4-5-fold increase in affinity for the antagonist CV3988, which is a PAF analog, whereas the FFGG mutant had the same affinity when compared with the WT receptor. Other such interaction studies between PAF receptor mutants and structurally distinct ligands are presently under way in our laboratory to further analyze the sites of interaction of these molecules with the receptor. In summary, we have reported here and in a previous study (23Parent J.L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that the PAF molecule does not bind to its receptor by interacting with the Asp63, Asn285, and Asp289 residues, contrary to what had been proposed in a recent molecular model of the PAF receptor (24Kajihara A. Komooka H. Kamiya K. Yoneda T. Yoneda S. Nakamura M. Shimizu T. Umeyama H. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1994; 9: 185-196PubMed Google Scholar). Discrepancies between the molecular model and our experimental data may come from the fact that the model was based on the bacteriorhodopsin three-dimensional structure, which displays a seven-transmembrane domain topography but is not a G protein-coupled receptor and has no notable sequence homology. A projection map of rhodopsin (a G protein-coupled receptor) at a 9-Å resolution showed that the configuration of the helices of bacteriorhodopsin was different from rhodopsin (35Schertler G.F.X. Villa C. Henderson R. Nature. 1993; 362: 770-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Such differences are likely to exist with the PAF receptor. However, we suggest that receptor conformation and transition could be influenced by the amino acids found at positions 63 (23Parent J.L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), 97, 98, 285, and 289. Moreover, we have shown that Asp63 (23Parent J.L. Le Gouill C. Rola-Pleszczynski M. Stankova J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the residue found at position 289 are determinant in receptor activation. Work is under way in our laboratory to identify residues directly involved in ligand binding to the PAF receptor and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of how the PAF receptor ligands bind to their receptor and effect physiological responses.

Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1031-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Recently, cDNA clones of mammalian type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase have been isolated (7Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jarchau T. Hausler C. Markert T. Pohler D. Vandekerckhove J. DeJonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Vaandrager A.B. Scholte B.J. Lohmann S.M. Nairn A.C. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol.

Vincent S.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2814-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A regulatory role for type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase in chloride transport in the small intestine has been suggested (9French P.J. Bijman J. Edixhoven M. Vaandrager A.B. Scholte B.J. Lohmann S.M. Nairn A.C. de Jonge H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26626-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Assessing a possible role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in cells where its expression is low is difficult, since the effects of cGMP could be carried out by cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases or cGMP-gated channels (1Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 115-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there are reports of a number of cell types in which cGMP-dependent protein kinase is likely to mediate some of the effects of cGMP, despite being present in low amounts. For example, physiologically significant roles for type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase in neutrophils and macrophages have been suggested by Lincoln and co-workers (11Pryzwansky K.B. Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Blood. 1995; 85: 222-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pryzwansky K.B. Kidao S. Wyatt T.A. Reed W. Lincoln T.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). cGMP-dependent protein kinase may also regulate the stimulation of potassium channel activity by atrial natriuretic peptide in rat pituitary tumor cells (13White R.E. Lee A.B. Shcherbatko A.D. Lincoln T.M. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), induction of long term potentiation in guinea pig hippocampal slices (14Zhuo M. Hu Y. Schultz C. Kandel E.R. Hawkins R.D. Nature. 1994; 368: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and somatostatin-induced inhibition of Ca2+-channel opening in chick ciliary ganglion neurons (15Meriney S.D. Gray D.B. Pilar G.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to these advances in knowledge of the mammalian cGMP-dependent protein kinases, nothing is known about the physiological roles of the Drosophila cGMP-dependent protein kinases. There are two Drosophila cGMP-dependent protein kinase genes (DG1 and DG2) (16Foster J.L. Higgins G.C. Jackson F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1676-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence comparisons with mammalian cGMP-dependent protein kinases indicate that DG1 and certain forms of DG2 protein contain a kinase inhibitory domain, two cGMP binding domains, an unconserved connecting sequence, an ATP binding site, and a catalytic domain (7Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jarchau T. Hausler C. Markert T. Pohler D. Vandekerckhove J. DeJonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Based on the same comparisons, it has also been suggested that some forms of DG2, but perhaps not DG1, contain an amino-terminal dimerization domain similar to the mammalian enzymes (17Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 202: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The protein products of the DG1 and DG2 genes have not been studied. As a result, even the name, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, for the DG1 and DG2 gene products is based solely on sequence homology (17Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to gain insights into the physiological role of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in Drosophila, we have undertaken a biochemical characterization of DG1 protein and examined its tissue distribution in embryos and adults. Molecular biology reagents, Escherichia coli strain TB1, and the pMAL-c expression vector were obtained from New England BioLabs. pVL1393 was from Invitrogen. Miracloth was purchased from Calbiochem, lysozyme from Boehringer Mannheim, histone H2B from Worthington Biochemicals, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG from Jackson Laboratories, and radioactive compounds from DuPont NEN. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Resource Center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. DNA sequencing, RNA preparation, Northern blot analysis, cDNA library screening, and histone kinase assays were carried out as described previously (16Foster J.L. Higgins G.C. Jackson F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1676-1681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Jackson F.R. Newby L.M. Kulkarni S.J. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 1068-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Foster J.L. Guttmann J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5029-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined using a modified Lowry procedure (25Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). A near full-length DG1 cDNA was isolated from the library of Itoh et al. (26Itoh N. Salvaterra P. Itakura K. Drosophila Inf. Serv. 1985; 61: 89Google Scholar) and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pUC19 to produce pG8. Sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA of 2551 bases was longer than cD32a (17Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by 24 bases at the 5′ end and 93 bases at the 3′ end (Accession number U59901). Despite 19 polymorphisms between the protein coding sequences, there are only two differences in the amino acid sequences encoded by cD32a and pG8, Gln at 235 instead of His and Arg at 438 instead of Gln. Neither the Gln nor the Arg in the cD32a sequence is conserved between DG1 and DG2 or mammalian proteins. An adaptor strategy was used to clone the entire DG1 sequence into pMAL-c (StuI, EcoRI) in frame with malE coding sequence. The adaptor placed coding sequence for the first five amino acids of DG1 in frame with malE followed by an HpaI site. The SalI site in the 3′-untranslated region in pG8 was destroyed, and then the HincII, EcoRI fragment was cloned into the adapted pMAL-c vector. This construct was then digested with XhoI and XbaI, blunted with Klenow, and religated to yield an expression plasmid encoding DG1 amino acids 2-457 in frame with malE. To express the carboxyl-terminal domain of DG1 (amino acids 428-768), the NheI (blunt)-EcoRI fragment of pG8 was cloned into pMAL-c (StuI, EcoRI). The NaeI-EcoRI and the ApaI (blunt)-EcoRI fragments were also cloned into pMAL-c (StuI, EcoRI) to yield vectors expressing DG1 amino acids 228-768 and 286-768, respectively. The expression vectors encoding the full-length DG1 amino acid sequence, as well as amino acids 228-768 or 286-768, expressed MBP/DG1 fusion proteins of expected length as determined by Western blot, but the amount of undegraded protein was substantially reduced compared with MBP/DG1N (amino acids 2-457) and MBP/DG1C (amino acids 428-768) fusion proteins. To construct an expression vector for DG1 in Sf9 cells, the 5′ EcoRV-NheI and the 3′ NheI-EcoRI fragments of pG8 were triple-ligated with pVL1393 (SmaI, EcoRI) to make pVLG. Preliminary studies determined that a rich broth without glucose was the best media for expression of MBP/DG1C in TB1 bacteria. Published methods were used for the purification of MBP fusion proteins (27Jarrett H.W. Foster J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5578-5586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Buffer L contained 0.05% Tween 20. Following centrifugation at 54,000 × g, the supernatant was filtered through Miracloth and applied directly to a 10-ml amylose affinity column, and the eluted fusion protein (2 ml fractions) was not concentrated. The two or three fractions containing the most fusion protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE, 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. were used to immunize rabbits. Fusion protein (3 ml) was reduced and denatured and then electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was rinsed in water at room temperature for 15 min and then incubated in 2 KCl at 4°C for 30 min. The proteins were then detectable as white bands by side illumination against a black background. The undegraded antigen was cut from the gel, and the gel strip was rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. The acrylamide strips were stored at −70°C until use. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. To inject rabbits, the frozen strips were lyophilized and then ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle. The antigen was then added directly to 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, which was sonicated with 1 ml of Freund's adjuvant. The initial intramuscular and subcutaneous injections were with complete Freund's adjuvant, while additional injections at 6-week intervals were with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Test bleeds were analyzed by Western blot analysis using extracts from DG1-expressing Sf9 cells (see below). Antibody titer reached a maximum after four or five injections and the rabbits were bled and sacrificed. IgG was prepared using reagents from Pierce. The final volume of the purified IgG was adjusted to equal the volume of the initial serum sample. Recombinant baculovirus expressing DG1 was produced by cotransfecting Sf9 cells with 2 μg of pVLG and 1 μg of replication-defective baculovirus DNA (Pharmigen) in a T25 flask using the supplier's transfection buffers and protocol. After 4 days the media were removed and spun at 3000 × g for 3 min. The transfection supernatants were stored at 4°C. Four independent virus isolates were obtained by plaque purification, and high titer virus stocks were prepared for each. To assay DG1 kinase synthesized in Sf9 cells by the histone kinase assay, a single T25 flask was infected with high titer virus and incubated at 27°C for 2-3 days. The cells were dislodged from the flask by pipetting, pelleted, washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of 20 m potassium phosphate (pH = 6.8), 2 m EDTA, 25 m benzamidine, 1 m PMSF, 10 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and 2-μl aliquots were used for each assay. For sucrose density gradient analysis, Sf9 cells were infected and lysed as for the histone kinase assays. Bovine serum albumin and yeast alcohol dehydrogenase were added to 0.2 ml of lysate that was centrifuged through a 4-ml 5-20% sucrose gradient for 15 h at 55,000 × g. Samples were collected by puncturing the bottom of the centrifuge tube and collecting 5 drop fractions. Sixty flies, either live or stored at −70°C, were homogenized in 1.5 ml of 20 m potassium phosphate (pH = 6.8), 2 m EDTA, 25 m benzamidine, 1 m PMSF, 5 m 2-mercaptoethanol in a 5-ml Potter-Elvejem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and two 0.4-ml duplicate samples of supernatant were each added to 0.4 ml of homogenization buffer plus 25 μl of anti-MBP/DG1N IgG. An 80-μl aliquot of Protein A-Sepharose (Zymed) equilibrated in homogenization buffer (1:1) was added, and DG1 antigen was adsorbed for 1 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were washed at 4°C with 1 ml of Wash Buffer A (10 m Tris (pH = 7.5), 2 m EDTA, 0.5 m PMSF, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 NaCl) three times, followed by 2 washes with 1 ml of Wash Buffer B (Wash Buffer A, except 0.15 NaCl), and finally with 1 ml of Autophosphorylation Buffer (20 m potassium phosphate (pH = 6.8), 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 m MgCl2, 5 m 2-mercaptoethanol). Beads were then resuspended in 0.1 ml of Autophosphorylation Buffer, equilibrated to 30°C, and the autophosphorylation reaction initiated with 4 μl of a 1:1 mixture of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 7000 Ci/mmol) and appropriate cyclic nucleotide or water. The reaction was continued for 10 min and stopped with 25 μl of 0.5 EDTA (pH = 8.0). The beads were pelleted, the supernatant removed, and the beads eluted with 0.1 ml of 1.5 × SDS Sample Buffer. The eluted material was boiled for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Results were recorded by exposure of the dried gel to x-ray film, and the autophosphorylation was quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Anti-MBP/DG1N IgG was used to detect DG1 antigen in embryos and adults. Embryos were collected on grape plates smeared with brewers' yeast paste. The embryos from 1 plate were rinsed in water, dechorionated with 50% bleach, washed with water, and fixed in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline that contained 0.2% Triton X-100 and 1% formaldehyde and was equilibrated with 10 ml of heptane. After a 15 min fixation at room temperature, the embryos were spun at 100 × g for 10 s and the fixation medium removed. The embryos were washed in PBT (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.2% Triton X-100) and aliquoted to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Embryos were devitellinized by shaking for 2 min at room temperature in 10% heptane, 90% methanol (initially at −70°C). The embryos were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBT, 1 time with 1 ml of PBT containing 10% heat-inactivated goat serum (PBT-10%HIGS), and incubated overnight at 4°C in 0.5 ml of PBT-10%HIGS and anti-MBP/DG1N IgG or control IgG (1:500). To detect bound antibody, the embryos were washed at room temperature 3 times for 30 min each with 1 ml of PBT, 1 time for 30 min with PBT-5%HIGS, and incubated 2 h in 0.5 ml of PBT-5%HIGS and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500). The embryos were then washed 3 times for 30 min each with PBT and stained using the Sigma DAB Peroxidase Substrate Tablet Set according the supplier's instructions. Staining was monitored under a dissecting microscope and the reaction stopped by washing the embryos with water. The embryos were equilibrated in 80% glycerol and mounted on slides. For immunohistochemistry in adults, flies were frozen in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Miles, Inc.), and 10-μm sections were collected on subbed slides. The slides were air-dried for 1 h and fixed for 15 min in 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. The slides were then washed 2 times for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline and 1 time for 5 min in PBT. Anti-MBP/DG1N IgG or control IgG (1:250) was applied to the slides in PBT-5%HIGS and incubated overnight at 4°C. The slides were washed three times for 15 min in PBT at room temperature, and bound antibody was detected using the Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories) kit according to the supplier's instructions with second antibody at a dilution of 1:250. Two DG1 fusion proteins, MBP/DG1N and MBP/DG1C, were expressed in E. coli strain TB1 from pMAL-c vectors (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both fusion proteins were highly soluble and readily purified and were injected into rabbits to produce antisera. As previously reported for the mammalian type Iα protein (28Feil R. Kellermann J. Hofmann F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13152-13158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), bacterially expressed DG1 catalytic domain was devoid of kinase activity (not shown). Recombinant baculovirus containing the entire DG1 coding sequence from pG8 was produced. Four separate plaques were chosen and each grown to high titer (see “Experimental Procedures”). All four preparations of high titer virus induced high levels of cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity in infected Sf9 cells at 48 h. SDS-PAGE analysis of extracts from infected cells revealed a prominent 84-kDa band not present in extracts of Sf9 cells infected with a control recombinant virus (Fig. 1). To investigate the kinetic properties of the baculovirus-expressed DG1 kinase, histone kinase assays were performed as described previously for bovine lung extracts (24Foster J.L. Guttmann J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5029-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These assays contained 50 m Mg2+, reflecting the unusual Mg2+ dependence of mammalian cGMP-dependent protein kinase when using histone H2B as a substrate. In the presence of 10 μ cGMP, extracts of Sf9 cells infected with DG1-expressing virus contained 50-100 times the activity of cells infected with control virus. Therefore, protein kinase assays were performed directly on Sf9 cell extracts. The use of 50 m Mg2+ was subsequently shown to be appropriate by determining the Mg2+ dependence of the baculovirus-expressed enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2, histone kinase activity is maximal at elevated [Mg2+]. Histone kinase assays were employed to determine the cyclic nucleotide specificity of the baculovirus-expressed DG1 kinase. A 20-fold stimulation was seen after the addition of 10 μ cGMP. Assays were performed on extracts from Sf9 cells infected with virus from three of the four plaques initially chosen. The concentrations of five cyclic nucleotides (cGMP, cAMP, cIMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, and 8-bromo-cGMP) that gave 50% activation (A0.5) are listed in Table I.Table IKinetic constants for DG1 protein kinasecNMPA0.5nHμmcGMP0.19 ± 0.06 (9)1.28 ± 0.10 (6)cAMP11.7 ± 2.8 (3)0.92, 0.95cIMP5.3 ± 1.5 (4)1.24, 1.258BrcGMP0.04 ± 0.01 (4)1.24 ± 0.05 (3)8BrcAMP0.62 ± 0.06 (4)1.10, 1.16 Open table in a new tab Unexpectedly, cGMP, cIMP, and 8-bromo-cGMP gave evidence of cooperativity in the histone kinase assay; therefore, Hill coefficients (nH) are also reported for the five cyclic nucleotide monophosphates. Although cooperativity is observable in the direct binding assay of cGMP to the bovine lung enzyme, cooperativity has not been observed in the histone kinase assay (24Foster J.L. Guttmann J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5029-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mackenzie III, C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5589-5593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same kinetic properties were observed for enzyme derived from three of the four viral plaques. The fourth baculovirus plaque produced enzyme with a high basal level of histone kinase activity (>50% of maximally stimulated). The cause of this high basal activity was not further investigated, but it underscores the importance of using more than one plaque as a source of virus. Induction of large amounts of active DG1 kinase in Sf9 cells made it possible to determine if the enzyme is a dimer. Extracts of Sf9 cells containing the fly kinase were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation (Fig. 3). The major peak of DG1 protein was seen in sucrose gradient fractions corresponding to Mr = 170,000 (84-kDa subunits) with a minor peak at Mr = 65,000 (Fig. 3, A and B). This result is reminiscent of the holoenzyme dimer and the monomeric 65-kDa proteolytic fragment described for the bovine lung enzyme (31Heil W.G. Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Histone kinase analysis of the sucrose gradient fractions confirmed this interpretation for the fly cGMP-dependent protein kinase by demonstrating that the Mr = 65,000 monomer retained catalytic activity (Fig. 3C). It was also determined that intact DG1 kinase did not form a cystine-linked dimer during SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (not shown). Interestingly, antibody against the amino-terminal portion of DG1 kinase (anti-MBP/DG1N) readily detected the 84-kDa intact subunit, but only faintly detected the 65-kDa fragment (not shown). This suggests that the antibody's epitopes are predominantly near the amino terminus and that this end of the intact subunit was lost by proteolysis. The ability of the baculovirus-expressed DG1 enzyme to autophosphorylate was investigated. There was no detectable autophosphorylation in the absence of cyclic nucleotide, but both cGMP and cAMP induced a specific phosphorylation of the 84-kDa band (not shown). The availability of antisera to the bacterial fusion proteins afforded the opportunity to determine if the in vivo synthesized DG1 kinase could autophosphorylate. As shown in Fig. 4, DG1 from extracts of whole flies immunoadsorbed with anti-MBP/DG1N IgG could undergo autophosphorylation in the presence of 10 μ cGMP. In contrast, phosphorylation was not observed using anti-MBP/DG1C IgG (not shown). Both antisera efficiently recognize the baculovirus-expressed enzyme on Western blots (see above). The Mg2+ dependence of autophosphorylation for the bovine lung cGMP-dependent protein kinase is markedly different from that seen in the histone kinase assay (24Foster J.L. Guttmann J. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5029-5036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the Mg2+ dependence of autophosphorylation for the fly enzyme in the immunoadsorption assay was determined. The maximal activity for autophosphorylation occurs at approximately 10 m Mg2+ (Fig. 2). The activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase in crude extracts of Drosophila is too low to measure by standard assays. 2J. L. Foster and O. M. Rosen, unpublished observations. In addition, DG1 antigen immunoadsorbed from extracts of 100 adult flies is barely detectable by Western blot analysis using Vectastain ABC and other sensitive Western blot detection methods. 3G. C. Higgins and J. L. Foster, unpublished observations. Therefore, relative quantitation of DG1 by the autophosphorylation assay was investigated using the conditions established in Fig. 2. The assay was shown to be linear for 10 min (but not 20 min) at 30°C, and dilution of the extract prior to immunoadsorption by 2-, 4-, and 8-fold gave 49, 21, and 10% of the initial activity. Thus, the autophosphorylation assay was used to estimate the relative levels of DG1 activity in fly extracts. The first important observation was that the specific activity (arbitrary PhosphorImager units/min/mg protein) of fly extracts differed by severalfold from different genetic backgrounds. Despite this variation, a consistent sex difference was noted. The specific activity of extracts from females was only 35 ± 16% (n = 16) of the specific activity of that seen in comparable male extracts. To further characterize this difference, extracts of heads and bodies of both sexes were assayed. Normalizing the specific activity of the four extracts to 1.00 for the extracts from female heads gave specific activities for the extracts from female bodies, male heads, and male bodies of 0.38, 0.96, and 1.03, respectively (averages of two determinations). The specific activity of extracts from 0- to 24-h embryos was a tenth that of extracts from adult heads. The results of these autophosphorylation assays were unexpected because the previous Northern blot analysis by Kalderon and Rubin (17Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had indicated that DG1 mRNA levels were higher in 0-24-h embryos than in heads and low in bodies. Therefore, we re-examined the abundance of DG1 mRNA in heads, bodies, and 0-24-h embryos, and the results are presented in Fig. 5. In the present study, DG1 mRNA abundance was highest in heads, somewhat lower in bodies, and apparently lowest, although easily detectable, in embryos. These results are in accord with the levels of DG1 autophosphorylation activity found in comparable samples. To determine which tissues and cell types contain the DG1 kinase, we employed anti-MBP/DG1N IgG. The embryonic expression pattern of DG1 was characterized in whole mounts of embryos representing all developmental stages. Surprisingly, immunoreactive product was observed only in stage 13 embryos (Fig. 6A) and not at any other stage of embryogenesis (not shown). At this embryonic stage, prominent staining was observed near the anterior edge of the amnioserosa (open arrow) and in cephalic regions (filled arrow). This staining was specific for the DG1 antibody, since it was not seen in the absence of anti-MBP/DG1N IgG, with anti-MBP IgG, or with IgG from an antisera to an unrelated fly protein. As shown in higher"
https://openalex.org/W1895648106,"Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to examine the effects of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, on membrane currents in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate activated an inward sodium current. This current had a new permeability sequence to monovalent cations and a different pharmacological profile to that of other characterized Na+ channels. Long hyperpolarizing steps revealed that the current declined during the pulse, and the decline was voltage-dependent. Activation of the current required Mg2+ and ATP. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate, could not substitute for ATP. Soluble second messengers like cAMP, cGMP, inositol polyphosphates, and Ca2+ did not activate the Na+ current. These results suggest that nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues activate a Na+ current in rat basophilic leukemia cells that is new in terms of its selectivity, pharmacology, and activation mechanism. It may be the prototype for a new family of Na+ channels expressed in certain nonexcitable cells. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments were performed to examine the effects of the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, on membrane currents in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate activated an inward sodium current. This current had a new permeability sequence to monovalent cations and a different pharmacological profile to that of other characterized Na+ channels. Long hyperpolarizing steps revealed that the current declined during the pulse, and the decline was voltage-dependent. Activation of the current required Mg2+ and ATP. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues, adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate, could not substitute for ATP. Soluble second messengers like cAMP, cGMP, inositol polyphosphates, and Ca2+ did not activate the Na+ current. These results suggest that nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues activate a Na+ current in rat basophilic leukemia cells that is new in terms of its selectivity, pharmacology, and activation mechanism. It may be the prototype for a new family of Na+ channels expressed in certain nonexcitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1967614257,"We show that Escherichia coli produce a factor that inhibits the activity of tyrosine and serine/threonine protein kinases. The factor is a protein found in the periplasmic compartment and is also secreted into the culture medium. Using a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay specific for tyrosine kinase activity and inhibition of the tyrosine kinase p56lck, we purified this factor to apparent homogeneity. Analysis of trypsin-digested fragments by mass spectrometry identified the inhibitor as the bacterial periplasmic protein UDP-sugar hydrolase, an enzyme with potent and nonspecific 5′-nucleotidase activity. Overexpression of the enzyme in bacteria leads to coordinate increases in both 5′-nucleotidase and p56lck inhibitory activity, confirming the identity of the inhibitor. The kinase inhibitory activity appears to be due to the formation of adenosine, which we show is inhibitory for p56lck, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and casein kinase. Overexpression of UDP-sugar hydrolase leads to an increase in the recovery of enteropathogenic E. coli following infection of HeLa cell monolayers and corresponding alterations in tyrosine-phosphorylated host proteins. These results suggest that UDP-sugar hydrolase may be an important factor affecting host cell function following intracellular bacterial infection.

A common element in the life cycle of many bacterial pathogens is the establishment of residence inside host cells (1Finlay B.B. Falkow S. Microbiol.

Some studies have documented gene expression differences for bacteria that reside inside host cells (13Lee C.A. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4304-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and auxotrophic mutants of Salmonella have been found to be attenuated for pathogenicity (14Fields P.I. Swanson R.V. Haidaris C.G.

Using insertional mutagenesis in conjunction with large scale screening, several groups have identified mutants defective for invasion or intracellular replication (14Fields P.I. Swanson R.V.

Bavoil P.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4817-4823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, if any of the mutants act by affecting host signaling. In the course of employing Escherichia coli as a host for recombinant protein expression, we discovered that bacterial lysates contain a factor that inhibits the activity of the tyrosine kinase p56lck. The key role that tyrosine kinases play in host cell signaling, coupled with the possibility that this unexpected bacterial activity might be used to interfere with these functions, prompted us to further investigate this factor. Here we describe the initial characterization, purification, and identification of this factor and show that Ser/Thr kinases are inhibited as well. We also demonstrate the involvement of this inhibitory activity in bacterial invasion of human cells. The bacterial strains used in this study were DH5α (BRL), BL21 (Pharmacia), N4830-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and EPEC E2348/69 (20Donnenberg M.S. Calderwood S.B. Donohue R.A. Keusch G.T. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Brett Finlay, UBC, Vancouver). Bacterial cells were routinely grown in LB medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 28°C or 37°C with shaking. Ampicillin (Sigma), when added, was at 100 μg/ml. Plasmid pLA7 contains the UshA gene which encodes the UDP-sugar hydrolase protein in pBR322 (21Burns D.M. Beacham I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4325-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. I Beacham (Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia). Plasmid pBR322 is from ATCC (37017). LSTRA cells are transformed murine T cells that overexpress p56lck (22Marth J.D. Peet R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Cell. 1985; 43: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). They were obtained from Dr. Jamey Marth (San Diego). HeLa cells were from ATCC (CCL-2). Both cell lines were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 10% fetal bovine serum + penicillin and streptomycin. LSTRA cell cultures were also supplemented with 10−5β-mercaptoethanol. Two sources of p56lck were used in this study. Baculovirus-expressed p56lck was partially purified on a DEAE-column as described (23Watts J.D. Wilson G.M. Ettehadieh E. Clark-Lewis I. Kubanek C.-A. Astell C.R. Marth J.D. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 901-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified p56lck from LSTRA cells was prepared as follows. 1 liter of cells was collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoridePCFIAparticle concentration fluorescence immunoassayMBPmyelin basic proteinBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFPLCfast protein liquid chromatography. and resuspended in 15 ml of sonication buffer (20 m MOPS, pH 7.2, 75 m β-glycerophosphate, 2 m EDTA, 1 m sodium orthovanadate, 1 m NaF, 1 m PMSF, 1 m pepstatin). The cells were sonicated 4 times with 5-s pulses on ice, and nuclei and cell membranes were pelleted at 50,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman 70.1Ti ultracentrifuge rotor. The pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and recentrifuged at 70,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C in the same rotor. The supernatant containing partially purified p56lck was aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. phosphate-buffered saline 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay myelin basic protein bovine serum albumin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis fast protein liquid chromatography. cAMP-dependent protein kinase was purchased from Sigma. Casein kinase was purchased from UBI. Tyrosine kinase activity and its inhibition was routinely assayed using a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) as described by Babcook et al. (24Babcook J. Watts J. Aebersold R. Ziltener H.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Bovine brain myelin basic protein (Sigma) was covalently coupled to Fluoricon carboxyl-polystyrene beads with EDC and used as a substrate. The beads were suspended in 20 m Tris (pH 7.7), 0.5% BSA, 0.01% Brij-35 to a final concentration of 0.125% with an estimated MBP concentration of 25 μg/ml. Assay reactions were in 96-well Pandex assay plates in a total volume of 50 μl and included 20 μl of beads, 0.5 m ATP, 10 m MnCl2, 10 m dithiothreitol, baculovirus-expressed p56lck at 1:1,000 dilution, or LSTRA cell membrane preparations containing p56lck at 1:100. Typically, 5 μl of 2-fold serial dilutions of inhibitor fractions was added to the reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated by the addition of p56lck and allowed to proceed for 10 or 15 min at 37°C. Soluble components of the reaction were removed by suction through the porous support in the wells of the plate, the beads were washed and incubated with fluoresceinated antiphosphotyrosine antibody 3A12 at 1 μg/ml. After 10 min, unbound antibody was removed, the beads were washed, and fluorescence was measured. p56lck activity is expressed as relative fluorescence units. Inhibitory units were estimated by identifying the highest dilution of inhibitor still retaining p56lck inhibitory activity. Tyrosine and Ser/Thr kinase activity was also assayed using incorporation of γ-[33P]ATP and immobilization on p81-phosphocellulose paper. Briefly, assays were performed in 50-μl volumes in assay buffer (20 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 m MnCl2 or MgCl2, 1 m dithiothreitol, 0.5% BSA, plus 10 μCi of γ-[33P]ATP (50 μ ATP final concentration)) with the appropriate substrate (25 μg/ml MBP or 250 μg/ml partially dephosphorylated bovine casein (Sigma)). Reactions were initiated with the addition of ATP, incubated for 15 min at 30°C, and then terminated by the addition of 10 m EDTA. The reaction mixture was then dotted onto p81 phosphocellulose paper immobilized in a 96-well manifold. The filter paper was washed several times with 75 m phosphoric acid, dried, and placed in a Packard “flexifilter” plate. Scintillation fluid was added to the wells and the plate was counted in a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard). The ability of periplasmic fractions to inhibit p56lck was also tested using an in vitro kinase assay. Baculovirus-expressed p56lck was incubated in 20 m Tris (pH 7.4) buffer with 0.5% BSA, 10 m MnCl2, 10 m DTT, 0.5 m unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of γ-labeled ATP (Amersham) at 37°C. Samples also contained periplasmic extract (1:4 dilution) and/or MBP (25 μg/ml) and/or sodium molybdate (0.8 m). Reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried onto a 3MM filter paper, and exposed to x-ray film to visualize bands with incorporated phosphate. Bacterial cells were grown to stationary phase in LB medium at 28°C overnight with shaking at 225 rpm. Periplasmic fractions were prepared by resuspending the bacteria in TES (30 m Tris, pH 8.0, 10 m EDTA, 30% w/v sucrose) with lysozyme (Boehringer) to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The mixture was left on ice for 40 min with occasional mixing, then centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant (periplasmic fraction) was transferred to a fresh tube and PMSF to a final concentration of 1 m was added. Periplasmic fractions were stored at −80°C for several weeks with little loss of inhibitory activity. The cytoplasmic fraction was prepared by resuspending the remaining bacterial pellet in 15 m Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m NaCl, 5 m EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 m PMSF, sonicating to lyse the cells and shear DNA, and centrifuging at 12,000 × g to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration of the periplasmic extract was determined by Pierce protein assay and standardized to a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Solid ammonium sulfate was added slowly, with stirring, at 4°C. After each addition, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the proteins that had been salted out of solution. A small sample of each of the pellets was resuspended in 10 m Tris (pH 8.0), 1 m EDTA and passed through a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia). Each sample was then assayed for kinase inhibitory activity by PCFIA. The pellet containing the inhibitory activity was then resuspended in 10 m Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35 and dialyzed into the same buffer, with frequent changes of the dialysis buffer, overnight at 4°C. All column separations were performed using a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system at 4°C. A Q-Sepharose column (20 ml of matrix) was equilibrated with starting buffer (10 m Tris, pH 8, 1 m EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35), the sample was loaded, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of starting buffer, and then bound proteins eluted with an ascending NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.75, also over 10 column volumes. Flow rate was typically 2 ml/min. Q-Sepharose-purified inhibitor was concentrated 10-fold, and a 100-μl sample was analyzed on a Superose-12 gel filtration column (Pharmacia). The column was pre-equilibrated in column buffer (10 m Tris, pH 7.5, 100 m NaCl, 1 m EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35) with 5 column volumes and run at 0.2 ml/min. 0.2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for p56lck inhibitory activity. A similar volume containing protein standards of known molecular weight was run under the same conditions. Bio-Gel HTP hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) was equilibrated with HA starting buffer (10 m Tris, pH 8, 1 m EDTA, 2 NaCl, 0.01% Brij 35). The samples were loaded, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of HA starting buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0 to 0.3 NaF in starting buffer over 10 column volumes using the FPLC. The NaF gradient permanently altered the separation properties of the hydroxyapatite requiring the use of fresh matrix for each separation. Partially purified inhibitor samples were further separated on Mono Q (Pharmacia). The column was equilibrated in Q starting buffer (10 m Tris, pH 8, 1 m EDTA, 0.01% Brij 35), the sample was loaded, and bound proteins eluted with an ascending NaCl gradient to 1.5 NaCl. Purified protein fractions were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described by Hess et al. (25Hess D. Covey T.C. Winz R. Brownsey R.W. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1342-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of UDP-sugar hydrolase was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate. Fractions containing UDP-sugar hydrolase were incubated in 0.1 Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 5 m MnCl2, 1 mg/ml bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (Sigma), 1 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 100 μl in 96-well plates. After 20 min at 37°C, the reaction was terminated with the addition of NaOH to a final concentration of 0.05 and the release of p-nitrophenyl was measured by absorbance at 405 nm. Partially purified inhibitor fractions were incubated under standard kinase assay conditions with [14C]ATP for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction products were separated by thin layer chromatography on DEAE-cellulose plates with water/isobutyl alcohol/methanol/ammonium hydroxide in a ratio of 30:10:1:10 (v/v) as the solvent (26Cronstein B.N. Eberle M.A. Gruber H.E. Levin R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2441-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Location of the standards was determined by uv, and reaction products were visualized by autoradiography. EPEC cells were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture was diluted 1:20, and growth was continued for 2 h in LB + 1 m MnCl2. At this point, typical A600 were 0.2 to 0.3. The bacteria were collected, washed twice in PBS, and their concentration was adjusted to provide the appropriate multiplicity of infection. Aliquots of these cultures were plated to enumerate starting bacterial density. HeLa cell monolayers in 6-well plates were washed 3 times with RPMI + 10% fetal bovine serum containing 1% mannose, 1 m MnCl2 without antibiotic. The mannose was included to prevent nonspecific bacterial adherence to the monolayer. 0.2 ml of bacteria in 2 ml of medium was then added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h. The monolayers were washed 3 times with PBS and then 2 ml of medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamycin was added to kill all extracellular bacteria. Following a further 3-h incubation, the monolayers were again washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with 0.4 ml 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. 1.6 ml of LB was added and aliquots were plated to measure recovered bacteria. Control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that the concentration of gentamycin used was sufficient to kill extracellular bacteria and that the Triton X-100 treatment did not affect bacterial plating efficiency. Control DH5α bacteria were found to be noninvasive in this assay. HeLa cell monolayers were lysed in 30 m Tris (pH 6.8), 150 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 mg/ml PMSF, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 m Na3VO4. Lysates were analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as recommended by the supplier (UBI). The blot was developed and visualized with chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham). In the course of using bacteria as hosts for recombinant protein expression, we found that bacterial lysates contain a substance capable of inhibiting the protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck. Bacterial lysates were prepared from standard overnight cultures of N4830-1, DH5α, or BL21 cells grown in LB medium at 28°C and lysed with Nonidet P-40. These lysates were then added to p56lck PCFIA kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 1, untreated bacterial lysates from N4830-1 cells completely inhibited the ability of p56lck to phosphorylate immobilized MBP. In order to further define this factor, the inhibitory activity from periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions were compared. Although both fractions contained inhibitory activity, most of the cytoplasmic inhibitory activity could be neutralized by adding protease or phosphatase inhibitors. In contrast, the inhibitory activity present in the periplasmic fraction could not be neutralized with these inhibitors. We also found that the periplasmic inhibitory activity was moderately resistant to heat treatment but could be inactivated by incubating extracts for 1 h at 70°C. Phosphatases are present in the periplasm of bacteria grown under certain conditions such as low phosphate. As well, a Yersinia virulence factor has been shown to be a tyrosine-specific phosphatase (27Guan K. Dixon J.E. Science. 1990; 249: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 28Bliska J.B. Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1187-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We therefore tested to see if the inhibitor had tyrosine phosphatase activity using two methods. In the first method, MBP immobilized on beads was phosphorylated by p56lck, the beads were washed and then incubated with periplasmic lysates. The phosphotyrosine remaining on the beads was then measured by PCFIA (24Babcook J. Watts J. Aebersold R. Ziltener H.J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). No change in phosphotyrosine content was seen (not shown). In the second method, purified p56lck was incubated with γ-labeled [32P]ATP and MBP with or without periplasmic extracts. The reaction products were then separated by SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2, when the periplasmic extract is included throughout the course of the reaction, no phosphate is incorporated into either p56lck or MBP (lanes 6-8). When the periplasmic extract is added after the reaction has proceeded and phosphorylation has already occurred, incorporation ceases but does not decrease (lanes 2 and 4). These results suggest that the inhibitor is not a phosphatase, but rather interferes in some manner with the kinase activity of p56lck. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on periplasmic extracts, and fractions were assayed for inhibitory activity. As shown in Fig. 3, the inhibitory activity elutes in a single peak with a molecular weight of approximately 60,000. The inhibtory activity proved to be stable for at least 1 week at 4°C and for months at −80°C; however, only limited freezing and thawing could be tolerated. Therefore, throughout the purification process, freeze-thaw cycles were limited to one or at most two. Although the purification of the inhibitor was done with periplasmic extracts from N4830-1 cells, we subsequently found that the inhibitory activity was secreted as well and could be purified from culture supernatants. A number of biochemical separations were used to purify the periplasmic inhibitor. A summary of the separations is shown in Fig. 4 and Table I. The effective steps were found to be ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, elution from hydroxyapatite with NaF, isoelectric focusing, and further ion exchange separation on Mono Q. The combination of these steps results in an approximately 21,600-fold purification. Note that total recoverable activity increases following the first ion exchange step.Table I.Purification of the p56lck inhibitorPurification step% Recovery from previous stepCumulative increase in specific activityPeriplasmic extraction10010Ammonium sulfate95-100440Q-Sepharose180aTotal inhibitory activity increased following this purification step.5,720Hydroxyapatite6515,444Mono Q521,622a Total inhibitory activity increased following this purification step. Open table in a new tab Fig. 5 shows a silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of inhibitory fractions 22, 23, and 24 from the Mono Q column of Fig. 4. A prominent band with a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 is observed. Slices of similar SDS-PAGE gels were incubated in buffer to elute proteins, acetone-precipitated to remove SDS from protein, and the precipitate was assayed for p56lck inhibitory activity. As shown in Fig. 6, the gel slice corresponding to the Mr = 60,000 protein inhibits p56lck while eluates from the other slices do not.Fig. 6The periplasmic inhibitor can be eluted from SDS-PAGE gels. 4-mm slices from an SDS-PAGE gel of inhibitor purifed by ammonium sulfate, Q-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite were soaked overnight at room temperature in 10 m Tris (pH 8), 0.1% SDS to passively elute the protein. BSA as carrier was added and total protein was precipitated by the addition of 5 volumes of ice-cold acetone. After 2 h at −20°C, precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were resuspended in 10 m Tris, pH 8, and then assayed for kinase inhibitory activity. The inhibitory gel slices correspond to molecular weights between 55,000 and 65,000.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These results strongly suggested that the Mr = 60,000 protein was responsible for the p56lck inhibitory activity. Purified fractions were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon membrane. The region of membrane corresponding to the inhibitor was cut out, digested with trypsin, and the fragments were analyzed by mass spectrometry. 19 major peaks were identified and their molecular weights were compared to a data base of predicted tryptic fragments from bacterial proteins. 13 of the 19 peaks matched the predicted profile for the bacterial periplasmic enzyme UDP-sugar hydrolase. This enzyme was first characterized by Glaser et al. (29Glaser L. Melo A. Paul R. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1944-1954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Neu (30Neu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 3896-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its gene (UshA) was cloned by Burns and Beacham (21Burns D.M. Beacham I.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4325-4342Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Its properties match very closely with the properties of the inhibitor including resistance to moderate heat treatment, subcellular localization (periplasm), molecular weight (60,800), requirement for divalent cations (particularly Co2+ or Mn2+, not shown), hydrophilicity, and behavior on ion exchange and other matrices. In order to confirm that UDP-sugar hydrolase was responsible for the p56lck inhibitory activity, we introduced plasmid pLA7 that contains the full gene for the enzyme into bacteria and measured enzyme and kinase inhibitory activity. Introduction of this plasmid into E. coli results in the overexpression of its enzymatic activity by 10-fold. The corresponding kinase inhibitory activity in crude lysates or partially purified fractions increases by 50-fold relative to wild-type (Fig. 7). These results are entirely consistent with the conclusion that the kinase inhibitor is in fact UDP-sugar hydrolase. UDP-sugar hydrolase would appear to be an unusual candidate for a kinase inhibitor. However, this enzyme also possesses a potent and nonspecific 5′-nucleotidase activity. It is thus able to hydrolyze ATP to ADP, AMP, and adenosine. One possibility is that UDP-sugar hydrolase simply depletes ATP in the kinase reaction. We measured ATP hydrolysis by partially purified inhibitor extracts under the conditions of our kinase assay (i.e. 0.3-0.5 m ATP) and although we readily detected hydrolysis, the depletion of ATP (approximately 50%) was insufficient to account for the loss of kinase activity (Fig. 8). In fact, under the conditions of our assay, full kinase activity is still observed at 10 μ ATP. This experiment did show, however, that the primary enzymatic product was adenosine. We therefore tested for the ability of adenosine to inhibit the activity of p56lck. As shown in Fig. 9a, adenosine is a strong inhibitor of p56lck activity with an estimated IC50 of 0.3 m. Therefore, these results suggest that the production of adenosine is the mechanism by which UDP-sugar hydrolase inhibits p56lck.Fig. 9Adenosine inhibits p56lck, casein kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity in vitro. The inhibitory activity of adenosine on p56lck, casein kinase, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase was measured using the γ-[33P]ATP assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The substrate for p56lck was MBP. Partially dephosphorylated bovine casein was used as a substrate for the other kinases. Each point is the average ± S.E. of three measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our observation that p56lck could be inhibited by adenosine prompted us to look at inhibition by adenosine of other kinases. As shown in Fig. 9, b and c, adenosine also inhibits the activity of casein kinase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The estimated IC50 values for these two enzymes are 18 μ for casein kinase and 0.48 m for cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The ability to produce adenosine resulting in the inhibition of various protein kinases suggested that UDP-sugar hydrolase may also play a role in bacterial-host interaction. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase in an in vitro model of bacterial intracellular invasion. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) strains have the ability to adhere to and invade human cells; however, intracellular survival is limited and recovery of intracellular bacteria decreases over time (not shown). Monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with log phase EPEC cells containing pLA7 or the parent vector pBR322. If the incubation period is limited to 1 h, no differences in recovery of bacteria are seen between EPEC cells containing pBR322 or pLA7 (not shown). This observation suggests that bacterial growth, adherence, and invasion are unaffected by the presence of UDP-sugar hydrolase. However, if the incubation period is extended to 3 h, overexpression of UDP-sugar hydrolase results in an approximate 10-fold increase in the number of bacteria recovered over a wide range of multiplicities of infection (10 to 500) (Fig. 10). These results suggest that bacteria overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase have an increased ability to survive once inside the HeLa cells. Since our in vitro results suggested to us that invasive bacteria could affect signaling events once inside the cell, we performed an invasion assay and examined infected cells for alterations in phosphotyrosine content. As shown in Fig. 11, uninfected HeLa cells display a prominent phosphotyrosine-containing protein of approximately 120 kDa. 1 and 3 h after infection, the phosphotyrosine content of this band decreases in cells infected with both strains, but the decrease is greater in cells infected with EPEC overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase. As described earlier by Rosenshine et al. (31Rosenshine I. Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Finlay B.B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), infection with EPEC results in the induction of additional phosphotyrosine-containg bands of host cell origin (approximately 90 and 140 kDa). We also observe a marked reduction in phosphotyrosine content of these bands 3 h after infection with EPEC overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase activity. These results suggest that host cell signaling is being disrupted by invading EPEC and that UDP-sugar hydrolase overexpression enhances this effect. p56lck, a member of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, is a T cell-specific kinase with both autophosphorylation activity and the ability to phosphorylate exogenous substrates such as myelin basic protein. We found that coincubation of bacterial lysates with this enzyme strongly inhibits its activity. We linked the inhibitory activity to a Mr = 60,000 periplasmic protein, purified it to homogeneity, and identified it as the bacterial enzyme UDP-sugar hydrolase. The inhibitor shares many biochemical properties with UDP-sugar hydrolase including its molecular weight, behavior on ion exchange and other matrices, relative resistance to heat treatment, its hydrophilicity, and its dependence on divalent cations such as Mn2+ (but not Ca2+ or Mg2+). Overexpression of UDP-sugar hydrolase in bacteria results in a coordinate increase in 5′-nucleotidase activity as well as p56lck inhibitory activity. Taken together, these results strongly support the identity of the kinase inhibitor as UDP-sugar hydrolase. When first identified and characterized, the role assigned to UDP-sugar hydrolase was as a component of the nucleotide scavenging pathway. Its ability to hydrolyze nucleotides enables the products of the reaction to enter into the bacterial cell where they can be used as nucleotide precursors, or as a carbon source. In fact, cells possessing this enzyme can grow using 5′-AMP as the sole carbon source. The role of its UDP-sugar hydrolase activity is less clear. UDP-sugars are involved in glycogen synthesis, acting as high energy intermediates. It is possible that this enzyme is also involved in scavenging these molecules. UDP-sugar hydrolase is a potent and relatively nonspecific 5′-nucleotidase. Although it does deplete ATP present in the kinase reaction, simple loss of ATP does not seem to be the basis of its inhibitory activity. Rather, we have found that adenosine, the reaction product, is inhibitory for the protein kinases. We have also investigated the potential inhibitory activity of AMP and ADP on the kinases and find that only p56lck is also significantly inhibited by these molecules (IC50 of 50 and 25 μ respectively 2S. A. Berger, unpublished data. ). However, since adenosine is the only hydrolysis product detected under the conditions of our assay, we conclude that the production of adenosine is the mechanism by which UDP-sugar hydrolase inhibits the kinases. This result is intriguing, considering the fact that deficiencies in adenosine deaminase, the major enzyme responsible for “detoxifying” adenosine, results in a severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, the most notable feature being severe T cell deficiency (32Hirschhorn R. Immunodefic. Rev. 1990; 2: 175-198PubMed Google Scholar). Adenosine, in addition to its metabolic role as a nucleotide precursor, also has other functions. In vivo, its main physiological function seems to be as a regulator of cardiac rhythm; however, it also has documented anti-inflammatory effects. These include inhibition of neutrophil adhesion (33Firestein G.S. Bullough D.A. Erion M.D. Jimenez R. Ramirez-Weinhouse M. Barankiewicz J. Smith C.W. Gruber H.E. Mullane K.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 326-334PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of platelet aggregation (34Kitakaze M. Hori M. Kamada T. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and inhibition of superoxide burst by neutrophils (35Cronstein B.N. Daguma L. Nichols D. Hutchison A.J. Williams M. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1150-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 36Gunther G.R. Herring M.B. Ann. Vasc. Surg. 1991; 5: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cronstein et al. (37Cronstein B.N. Naime D. Ostad E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2675-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) have shown that the anti-inflammatory effects of methotrexate are most likely mediated through a buildup of adenosine. In vitro, adenosine is a known inhibitor of phosphoinositol kinases (38Yamamoto K. Graziani A. Carpenter C. Cantley L.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22086-22089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a key second messenger generating enzyme. We have shown that UDP-sugar hydrolase can inhibit a tyrosine kinase and two Ser/Thr kinases, and Kim and Matthews 3Y. Kim and H. R. Matthews, unpublished data. have shown that yeast histidine kinase is also inhibited. Thus, although we have characterized this enzyme primarily as an inhibitor of p56lck, it appears that its effects are more widespread. Therefore, overproduction of adenosine by an infectious agent may result in inhibition of a wide variety of kinases and could therefore be of general utility in compromising host function. At the present time, we have not identified the mechanism of inhibition of protein kinases by adenosine. Preliminary data suggest that at least for p56lck, adenosine does not act as a competitive inhibitor for ATP.2 As well, the fact that the apparent IC50 values for the kinases varies for each enzyme suggests that there may be considerable specificity. Further experiments are required to address the mechanism of inhibition and the identification of other potential targets. The multiple kinase inhibitory activities of UDP-sugar hydrolase products coupled with its role in the metabolism of nucleotides and UDP-sugars suggested to us that this enzyme might influence bacterial intracelluar infection. To test this, we investigated the effect of overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase in the EPEC model of in vitro bacterial invasion. Once EPEC invade the monolayer, extensive growth does not normally occur. This assay is therefore a useful one for investigating potential factors that can affect intracellular survival. We found that overexpression significantly increases the recovery of enteropathogenic E. coli following invasion over a wide range of multiplicities of infection, but only following a 3-h incubation period. Since no differences were seen after short incubation times, this result suggests that overexpression of UDP-sugar hydrolase increases bacterial survival once inside the HeLa cells. At present, we do not know the precise biochemical mechanism mediating this effect. However, the multiple inhibitory activities of adenosine, coupled with its involvement in nucleotide scavenging, suggests that this enzyme may have an essential metabolic role, or may act as a general host “anergizing” factor, possibly affecting host cell signaling. In agreement with this possibility, we found that the phosphotyrosine content of the major phosphorylated proteins in HeLa cells decreased following EPEC infection. Furthermore, this decrease was even greater in HeLa cells infected with EPEC cells overexpressing UDP-sugar hydrolase. UDP-sugar hydrolase is widely distributed and highly conserved throughout evolution, and it is possible that other pathogens may also employ this enzyme during infectious situations. For instance, Smail et al. (39Smail E.H. Cronstein B.N. Meshulam T. Esposito A.L. Ruggeri R.W. Diamond R.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3588-3595PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that supernatants from germinated Candida albicans cultures contain adenosine which is responsible for inhibiting neutrophil function. Therefore, the induction of host cell toxicity or anergy via adenosine production may represent a novel and general mechanism of pathogenicity. We wish to thank G. Wong, T. Strugnell, J. Hurov, S.

https://openalex.org/W1973617156,"The assembly of a heterodimeric luciferase was studied after de novo synthesis of corresponding precursor proteins in reticulocyte lysate and concomitant transport into dog pancreas microsomes. This cytosolic luciferase from a prokaryotic organism (Vibrio harveyi) was specifically used as a model protein to investigate (i) whether the eukaryotic cytosol and the microsomal lumen have similar folding capabilities and (ii) whether the requirements of a polypeptide for certain molecular chaperones and folding catalysts are determined by the polypeptide or the intracellular compartment. The two luciferase subunits were fused to the preprolactin signal peptide. Data indicate that efficient assembly of luciferase occurs in the mammalian microsomes. Furthermore, it was observed that luciferase assembly can be separated in time from synthesis and membrane transport, depends on ATP hydrolysis, is partially sensitive to cyclosporin A and FK506, and in the absence of lumenal proteins is less efficient as compared with the presence of lumenal proteins. Thus, heterodimeric luciferase depends on functionally related molecular chaperones and folding catalysts during its assembly in either the eukaryotic cytosol or the microsomal lumen."
