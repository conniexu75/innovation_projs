https://openalex.org/W3088259748,"Background To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and its effect on adverse clinical outcomes, and parameters of immune function and mortality due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Study design The hospital data of 235 patients infected with COVID-19 were analyzed. Results Based on CDC criteria, among our study patients, 74% had severe COVID-19 infection and 32.8% were vitamin D sufficient. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was a significant association between vitamin D sufficiency and reduction in clinical severity, inpatient mortality serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and an increase in lymphocyte percentage. Only 9.7% of patients older than 40 years who were vitamin D sufficient succumbed to the infection compared to 20% who had a circulating level of 25(OH)D< 30 ng/ml. The significant reduction in serum CRP, an inflammatory marker, along with increased lymphocytes percentage suggest that vitamin D sufficiency also may help modulate the immune response possibly by reducing risk for cytokine storm in response to this viral infection. Conclusion Therefore, it is recommended that improving vitamin D status in the general population and in particular hospitalized patients has a potential benefit in reducing the severity of morbidities and mortality associated with acquiring COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3088279250,"Background The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion The human-animal bond is a construct that may be linked to mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Strength of the human-animal bond in terms of emotional closeness or intimacy dimensions appears to be independent of animal species. Animal ownership seemed to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of Covid-19 lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required."
https://openalex.org/W3088172122,"Ancient DNA has provided new insights into many aspects of human history. However, we lack comprehensive studies of the Y chromosomes of Denisovans and Neanderthals because the majority of specimens that have been sequenced to sufficient coverage are female. Sequencing Y chromosomes from two Denisovans and three Neanderthals shows that the Y chromosomes of Denisovans split around 700 thousand years ago from a lineage shared by Neanderthals and modern human Y chromosomes, which diverged from each other around 370 thousand years ago. The phylogenetic relationships of archaic and modern human Y chromosomes differ from the population relationships inferred from the autosomal genomes and mirror mitochondrial DNA phylogenies, indicating replacement of both the mitochondrial and Y chromosomal gene pools in late Neanderthals. This replacement is plausible if the low effective population size of Neanderthals resulted in an increased genetic load in Neanderthals relative to modern humans."

https://openalex.org/W3089281018,"Antenatal care (ANC) is a vital mechanism for women to obtain close attention during pregnancy and prevent death-related issues. Moreover, it improves the involvement of women in the continuum of health care and to survive high-risk pregnancies. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of and identify the associated factors of eight or more ANC contacts in Nigeria.We used a nationally representative cross-sectional data from Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey-2018. A total sample of 7,936 women were included in this study. Prevalence was measured in percentages and the factors for eight or more ANC contacts were examined using multilevel multivariable binary logistic regression model. The level of significance was set at P<0.05.The prevalence of eight or more ANC contacts in Nigeria was approximately 17.4% (95% CI: 16.1%-18.7%). Women with at least secondary education were 2.46 times as likely to have eight or more ANC contacts, when compared with women with no formal education. Women who use media were 2.37 times as likely to have eight or more ANC contacts, when compared with women who do not use media. For every unit increase in the time (month) of ANC initiation, there was 53% reduction in the odds of eight or more ANC contacts. Rural women had 60% reduction in the odds of eight or more ANC contacts, when compared with their urban counterparts. Women from North East and North West had 74% and 79% reduction respectively in the odds of eight or more ANC contacts, whereas women from South East, South South and South West were 2.68, 5.00 and 14.22 times respectively as likely to have eight or more ANC contacts when compared with women from North Central.The coverage of eight or more ANC contacts was low and can be influenced by individual-, household-, and community-level factors. There should be concerted efforts to improve maternal socioeconomic status, as well as create awareness among key population for optimal utilization of ANC."
https://openalex.org/W3087999857,"To investigate the clinical value of changes in the subtypes of peripheral blood lymphocytes and levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19, the total numbers of lymphocytes and CD4+ lymphocytes and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes were calculated and observed in different groups of patients with COVID-19. The results show that the lymphocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 was mainly manifested by decreases in the CD4+ T lymphocyte number and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. The decreased number of CD4+ T lymphocytes and the elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were correlated with the severity of COVID-19 disease."
https://openalex.org/W3089081101,"After spinal cord injury (SCI), the irreversible loss of neurons and the dense glial scar are two of the leading causes of axon regeneration failure. The adult mammalian spinal cord lacks the ability to spontaneously produce new neurons, making it a key challenge to provide new neurons for spinal cord regeneration. Additionally, the dual role of the glial scar (both inhibitory and protective) makes it difficult to manipulate it for therapeutic purposes. In this study, using a single transcription factor Sry-related HMG-box 2 (Sox2) delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV), we reprogrammed some of the astrocytes targeted by the viral vectors in the glial scar into neurons in a severe SCI model. We show that this astrocytic reprogramming alone can propel axon regeneration by not only replenishing the lost neurons, but also moderately reducing the density of the glial scar without interrupting its integrity. Beyond that, astrocytic reprogramming can significantly improve functional recovery when combined with running wheel rehabilitation, which provides use-dependent plasticity. These findings may provide us with a new idea for how to manipulate the glial scar and a promising therapeutic strategy that combines biological intervention with a rehabilitation strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3088450100,"Botswana is currently undergoing rapid epidemiological transition indicated by a decline in infectious diseases and an increase in chronic non-communicable diseases and their associated risk factors. The main aim of this study was to assess prevalence and correlates of multimorbidity among the adult population in Botswana.A cross-sectional study called Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Study (NCDs study) was conducted in March, 2016. Using multistage cross sectional sampling design, 1178 male and female respondents aged 15 years and above were interviewed across 3 cities and towns, 15 urban villages and 15 rural villages. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Adjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess covariates of multimorbidity. The statistical significant level was fixed at p <0 .05.Prevalence of multimorbidity in the sampled population was estimated at 5.4%. Multivariate results indicate that the odds of multimobridty were significantly high among women (AOR = 3.34, 95% C.I. = 1.22-21.3) than men. On the other hand, the odds of multimorbidity were significantly low among young people aged below 24 years (AOR = 0.01, 95% C.I. = 0.00-0.07), currently married people (AOR = 0.24, 95% C.I. = 0.07-0.80) and individuals in the 2nd wealth quintile (AOR = 0.20, 95% C.I. = 0.05-0.75) compared to their counterparts. For behavioural risk factors, alcohol consumption (AOR = 4.80, 95% C.I. = 1.16-19.8) and overweight/obesity (AOR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.12-2.61) were significantly associated with high multimorbidity prevalence.Multimorbidity was found to be more prevalent among women, alcohol consumers and overweight/obese people. There is need to strengthen interventions encouraging healthy lifestyles such as non-consumption of alcohol, physical activity and healthy diets. Moreover, there is need for a holistic approach of health care services to meet the needs of those suffering from multimorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3087804249,"The consumption of fish contaminated with microplastics is often cited as a pathway for human exposure. However, because their guts are generally removed before consumption, exposure may be low compared to other routes such as shellfish, drinking water and dust. Still, microplastics have been found to translocate from the gut to other tissues, making exposure from eating fish fillets or other seafood products a potential concern. To better understand fish as an exposure route for microplastics in humans, we tested hypotheses about whether translocation occurs and if efficiency of translocation is dependent on particle size. We investigated the amount and distribution of fluorescent polyethylene microspheres (10–300 μm) in the gut, liver, fillets and gonads of adult rainbow trout after a two-week dietary exposure. Fish were fed food pellets dosed with up to ~9,800 microspheres per gram of food. Total exposures over the entire experiment ranged from ~80,000–850,000 microspheres per fish. We did not find any particles in the fillets, liver, or gonads of any fish, suggesting that translocation of spherical microplastics of this size range does not occur in adult rainbow trout. The quantity of microplastics found in the gut was also low or absent after a 24-hour depuration period, indicating effective excretion in this laboratory population. This research suggests that the consumption of fish fillets may not be a significant exposure pathway for microspheres >10 μm in size to contaminate humans. Future studies should test for different sizes, morphologies and species to further our understanding."
https://openalex.org/W3089312151,"Abstract ERα positive breast cancer accounts for 70% of breast malignancies. Compared with ERα negative types, ERα positive breast cancer could be effective controlled by endocrine therapy. However, more than half of the patients will develop endocrine resistance, making it an important clinical issue for breast cancer therapy. Endocrine resistance might be caused by multiple alternations, including the components of ERα signaling, during tumor progression. Thus, it is urgent and necessary to uncover the molecular mechanisms that controls ERα expression and stability to improve breast cancer therapeutics. In our current study, we identifies that the ubiquitin ligase RNF181 stabilizes ERα and facilitates breast cancer progression. The expression of RNF181 is correlated with ERα level in human breast tumors and relates to poor survival in endocrine-treated patients. RNF181 depletion inhibits breast cancer progression in vivo and in vitro, reduces ERα protein level and its target gene expression, such as PS2 and GREB1. Unbiased RNA sequencing analysis indicates RNF181 is necessary for ERα signature gene expression in whole genomic level. Immuno-precipitation assays indicate that RNF181 associates with ERα and promotes its stability possibly via inducing ERα K63-linked poly-ubiquitination. In conclusion, our data implicate a non-genomic mechanism by RNF181 via stabilizing ERα protein controls ERα target gene expression linked to breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3088110174,"Wnt signaling dysregulation promotes tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the role of PTPRF, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, in regulating Wnt signaling in CRC. Knockdown of PTPRF decreased cell proliferation in patient-derived primary colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines. In addition, the rate of proliferation as well as colony formation ability were significantly decreased in tumor organoids grown in 3D, whereas the number of differentiated tumor organoids were markedly increased. Consistently, knockdown of PTPRF resulted in a decrease in the expression of genes associated with cancer stem cells downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Treating PTPRF knockdown cells with GSK3 inhibitor rescued the expression of Wnt target genes suggesting that PTPRF functions upstream of the β-catenin destruction complex. PTPRF was found to interact with LRP6 and silencing PTPRF largely decreased the activation of LRP6. Interestingly, this PTPRF-mediated activation of Wnt signaling was blocked in cells treated with clathrin endocytosis inhibitor. Furthermore, knockdown of PTPRF inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo and decreased the expression of Wnt target genes. Taken together, our studies identify a novel role of PTPRF as an oncogenic protein phosphatase in supporting the activation of Wnt signaling in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W3087831206,"The use of ultrasound-stimulated microbubble therapy has successfully been used to target tumor vasculature and enhance the effects of radiation therapy in tumor xenografts in mice. Here, we further investigate this treatment using larger, more clinically relevant tumor models. New Zealand white rabbits bearing prostate tumor (PC3) xenografts received a single treatment of either ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB), ionizing radiation (XRT; 8Gy), or a combination of both treatments (USMB+XRT). Treatment outcome was evaluated 24 hours after treatment using histopathology, immunolabeling, 3D Doppler ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. A second cohort of rabbits received multiple treatments over a period of three weeks, where USMB treatments were delivered twice weekly with daily XRT treatments to deliver a fractionated 2Gy dose five days per week. A significant decrease in vascular function, observed through immunolabeling of vascular endothelial cells, was observed in tumors receiving the combined treatment (USMB+XRT) compared to control and single treatment groups. This was associated with an increase in cell death as observed through in situ end labeling (ISEL), a decrease in vascular index measured by Power Doppler imaging, and a decrease in oxygen saturation. In rabbits undergoing the long-term fractionated combined treatment, a significant growth delay was observed after 1 week and a significant reduction in tumor size was observed after 3 weeks with combined therapy. Results demonstrated an enhancement of radiation effect and superior anti-tumor effect of the combination of USMB+XRT compared to the single treatments alone. Tumor growth was maximally inhibited with fractionated radiotherapy combined with the ultrasound-stimulated microbubble-based therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3088171179,"Background Early recognition and diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is critical to improve patient symptoms, and antifungal therapy may prevent or delay progression of bronchiectasis and development of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Objective A recently commercialized lateral flow assay (Aspergillus ICT) (LDBio Diagnostics, Lyons, France) detects Aspergillus-specific antibodies in <30 minutes, requiring minimal laboratory equipment. We evaluated this assay for diagnosis of ABPA compared to diseased (asthma and/or bronchiectasis) controls. Methods ABPA and control sera collected at the National Aspergillosis Centre (Manchester, UK) and/or from the Manchester Allergy, Respiratory and Thoracic Surgery research biobank were evaluated using the Aspergillus ICT assay. Results were read both visually and digitally (using a lateral flow reader). Serological Aspergillus-specific IgG and IgE, and total IgE titres were measured by ImmunoCAP. Results For 106 cases of ABPA versus all diseased controls, sensitivity and specificity for the Aspergillus ICT were 90.6% and 87.2%, respectively. Sensitivity for ‘proven’ ABPA alone (n = 96) was 89.8%, and 94.4% for ‘presumed’ ABPA (n = 18). ‘Asthma only’ controls (no bronchiectasis) and ‘bronchiectasis controls’ exhibited 91.4% and 81.7% specificity, respectively. Comparison of Aspergillus ICT result with Aspergillus-specific IgG and IgE titres showed no evident immunoglobulin isotype bias. Digital measurements displayed no correlation between ImmunoCAP Aspergillus-specific IgE level and ICT test line intensity. Conclusions The Aspergillus ICT assay exhibits good sensitivity for ABPA serological screening. It is easy to perform and interpret, using minimal equipment and resources; and provides a valuable simple screening resource to rapidly distinguish more serious respiratory conditions from Aspergillus sensitization alone."
https://openalex.org/W3089012942,"To describe the duration, progression and patterns of first stage of labor among Swedish women.Population-based cohort study.Data from Stockholm-Gotland Obstetric Cohort 2008-2014 including ¼ of all births in Sweden, the final sample involved a total of 85,408 women with term, singleton, vertex, live fetuses experiencing spontaneous labor onset and vaginal delivery with normal neonatal outcomes.Time to progress during first stage of labor using three approaches: 1) Traverse time in hours to progress centimeter to centimeter, 5th, 50th (and 95th percentile); 2) Dilation curves for different percentiles, and; 3) Cumulative duration for the 95th percentile by parity and dilation at admission.Variation in both the total duration and the trajectory of cervical change over time is large. Similar to the general held view, the rate of cervical dilation accelerates at 5-6 centimeters. Among nulliparous women, the median time found in our population was faster than their counterparts in studies conducted on American and African cohorts. Among nulliparous and multiparous women our data suggest that the median cervical change over time is faster than 1 cm per hour during the first stage of labor. However, traverse time of cervical change at and beyond the 95th percentile is longer than 1 cm per hour.Labor progression varies widely and labors experiencing a prolonged first stage can still result in normal outcomes. The assumption of 1 cm per hour cervical dilation rate for the first stage of labor may not be universally meaningful. There are differences in progression for women during first stage of labor in different populations. For prolonged labor progression to be more clinically meaningful, the association with adverse birth outcomes needs to be further investigated in specific populations."
https://openalex.org/W3089320542,"In mammals, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) is a critical regulator of endometrial decidualization and early implantation. Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) is highly expressed in the endometrium and at the maternal-fetal interface in multiple species, including humans. BMP2-induced IGFBP3 signaling has been confirmed to have a role in trophoblast cell invasion; however, the involvement of this signaling pathway in endometrial remodeling remains poorly understood. To determine the roles of BMP2 in regulating IGFBP3 expression during the transformation of endometrial stromal cells, we employed immortalized human endometrial stromal cells (HESCs) and primary human decidual stromal cells (HDSCs) as study models. We showed that BMP2 significantly increased the expression of IGFBP3 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both HESCs and primary HDSCs. Additionally, the BMP2-induced upregulation of IGFBP3 is mediated by the inhibitor of DNA-binding 1 (ID1), and knockdown of ALK3 completely abolished BMP2-induced upregulation of ID1. Moreover, BMP2 increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and promoted cell migration in HESCs and primary HDSCs. Knockdown of either IGFBP3 or ID1 significantly suppressed the basal and the BMP2-induced increase in MMP2 expression as well as the cell migration in both cell models. These data demonstrated that BMP2 upregulated the expression of ID1, which in turn induced the expression of IGFBP3, and these BMP2-induced cell activities were most likely mediated by the ALK3 type I receptor. The increased expression of IGFBP3 promoted the MMP2 expression and cell migration in both HESCs and HDSCs. These findings deepen our understanding of a newly identified mechanism by which BMP2 and IGFBP3 regulate endometrial remodeling in humans, which provides insight into potential therapies for endometrium-related diseases and pregnancy-induced complications."
https://openalex.org/W3088267570,"Background The majority of oral cavity cancers arise in the oral tongue. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of tumor budding in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma, both as a separate variable and in combination with depth of invasion. We also assessed the prognostic impact of the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer’s TNM classification (TNM8), where depth of invasion (DOI) supplements diameter in the tumor size (T) categorization. Methods Patients diagnosed with primary oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated retrospectively. Spearman bivariate correlation analyses with bootstrapping were used to identify correlation between variables. Prognostic value of clinical and histopathological variables was assessed by Log rank and Cox regression analyses with bootstrapping using 5-year disease specific survival as outcome. The significance level for the hypothesis test was 0.05. Results One-hundred and fifty patients had available material for microscopic evaluation on Hematoxylin and Eosin-stained slides and were included in the analyses. Reclassification of tumors according to TNM8 caused a shift towards a higher T status compared to the previous classification. The tumor budding score was associated with lymph node metastases where 23% of the patients with low-budding tumors had lymph node metastases, compared with 43% of those with high-budding tumors. T-status, lymph node status, tumor budding, depth of invasion, and the combined tumor budding/depth of invasion score were all significantly associated with survival in univariate analyses. In multivariate analyses only N-status was an independent prognosticator of survival. Conclusion Reclassification according to TNM8 shifted many tumors to a higher T-status, and also increased the prognostic value of the T-status. This supports the implementation of depth of invasion to the T-categorization in TNM8. Tumor budding correlated with lymph node metastases and survival. Therefore, information on tumor budding can aid clinicians in treatment planning and should be included in pathology reports of oral tongue squamous cell carcinomas."

The molecular pathogenesis in Human papillomavirus (HPV) infected cases is inconclusive. The detection of molecular factors leading to progression of CaCx can be important in the diagnosis and management of the disease. p53 a known tumor suppressor gene having a regulative role in cell cycle has been highlighted as key factor in the prevention of cancer but its significance in CaCx cases has been variably documented. The present study therefore targeted to evaluate the significance of p53 profile in CaCx cases in ethnically distinct northeast Indian population.Blood and Tissue samples (N = 85) of cervical cancer patients were collected and screening for HPV was performed using PCR. Thereafter the differential mRNA expression(qPCR), Immunohistochemistry, Mutation (PCR direct sequencing method) of p53 was studied. Further p53 epigenetic profiling was done by Methylation specific PCR (MS-PCR) and western blotting by using p53 acetylation specific antibodies.Our findings revealed that the downregulation of p53 was associated with the progression of disease and the variation in downregulation based on p53 polymorphism was observed. Further hypermethylation and deacetylation of p53 was also found to be associated with the pathogenesis of CaCx. The downregulated expression and hypermethylation of p53 in lower grade of CaCx, together established its association with the progression of CaCx from lower to severe grade.Therefore, in CaCx patients of northeast Indian population, malfunctioning of p53 is found to have significant role in cervical cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W3088347366,"Background Despite the widespread recognition of the importance of mental health in young people, only a small proportion of young people with a mental disorder, including university students, receive mental health care. Objective We developed a smartphone application (Mental App) for the university students and examined the effects of the app on their mental health. Methods The app was designed according to a questionnaire survey conducted before this study. The Mental App was installed on the students’ smartphone and the psychological tests (the Link Stigma Scale, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and the 12-item General Health Questionnaire) were performed on the same day. After using the App for two weeks, the students completed a questionnaire survey and underwent the same psychological tests. We compared the results between the app user and non-user group. Results A total of 68 students participated, of which 57 students completed the study (app user group, n = 28; control group, n = 29). The mean number of days spent using the app was 5.66 ± 3.16 (mean ± SD). The mean total screen time of the app was 9:03 ± 06:41(min:sec). The mean number of total actions (screen taps or swipes) was 161.91 ± 107.34. There were no significant between-group differences in the ΔLink Stigma Scale score (-0.11 ± 4.28 vs. -0.59 ± 3.30, p = 0.496) or the ΔCenter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score (-4.39 ± 7.13 vs. -2.07 ± 8.78, p = 0.143). There was a significant between-group difference in the ΔGeneral Health Questionnaire score (-2.21± 2.23 vs. -0.17 ± 2.69, p = 0.007). Conclusions This non-randomized controlled pilot study indicates that the app we developed, may provide effective mental health care for university students, even in the short-term.

https://openalex.org/W3088960603,"Objectives The Medicare Health Outcome Survey (HOS) is the largest longitudinal survey of the U.S. community-dwelling elderly population. This study estimated total life expectancy, active life expectancy (ALE), and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) by disability status among HOS participants. Methods Data were from the Medicare HOS Cohort 15 (baseline 2012, follow-up 2014). We included respondents aged ≥ 65 years (n = 164,597). Participants’ disability status was assessed based on the following six activities of daily living (ADL): bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of chairs, walking, and using the toilet. The multi-state models were used to estimate life expectancy, ALE, and DFLE by participants’ baseline disability status and age. Results Persons who had higher-level ADL limitations had a shorter life expectancy, ALE, and DFLE. Also persons with disability had greater expected life years with disability than those with no limitations and those with mild limitations. For example, among 65-year old respondents with no limitations, mild limitations, and disability, life expectancy was 19.9, 18.6, and 17.1 years, respectively; ALE was 14.0, 9.5, and 7.2 years, respectively; DFLE was 17.3, 15.2, and 11.4 years, respectively; and expected years with disability was 2.6, 3.4, and 5.7 years, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated that greater levels of disability adversely impact life expectancy, ALE, DFLE, and expected number of years with a disability among U.S. older adults. Understanding levels of disability, and how these may change over time, would enhance health care quality and planning services related to home care and housing in this community-dwelling population."
https://openalex.org/W3088475302,"Despite the prevalence of everyday memory failures, little is known about which specific types have the strongest impact on everyday life, and whether their impact changes across adulthood. An investigation of memory failures at different ages is particularly informative to disentangle the age paradox in prospective memory, which seems to suggest that remembering to perform intended actions in everyday life improves with age. Therefore, 58 young adults, 40 middle-aged adults, and 54 elderly adults recorded their memory failures as and when they occurred during a 7-day period, and described how serious and consequential they were. Failures were coded into several subcategories of retrospective memory, prospective memory, and absent-minded lapses. It was prospective memory lapses that were overall the most common, serious and consequential ones. Young adults had substantially more prospective memory failures than the elderly and middle-aged adults who did not differ from each other. A young adult disadvantage still held up when lifestyle differences between young adults and the elderly were taken into account. Our findings support the age-related benefit previously found in naturalistic prospective memory tasks, and suggest that it is robust across various types of prospective memory tasks. The results also suggest that the benefit may result from both young adults having poor everyday prospective memory, compared to any adults of a greater age, and everyday prospective memory being spared from age-related decline between the middle and late adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3088432570,"Detection and diagnosis of early and subclinical stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) play an essential role in the implementation of intervention and prevention strategies. Neuroimaging techniques predominantly provide insight into anatomic structure changes associated with AD. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied towards creating and evaluating models capable of differentiating between cognitively unimpaired, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Several published approaches apply information fusion techniques, providing ways of combining several input sources in the medical domain, which contributes to knowledge of broader and enriched quality. The aim of this paper is to fuse sociodemographic data such as age, marital status, education and gender, and genetic data (presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 allele) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This enables enriched multi-modal features, that adequately represent the MRI scan visually and is adopted for creating and modeling classification systems capable of detecting amnestic MCI (aMCI). To fully utilize the potential of deep convolutional neural networks, two extra color layers denoting contrast intensified and blurred image adaptations are virtually augmented to each MRI scan, completing the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color channels. Deep convolutional activation features (DeCAF) are extracted from the average pooling layer of the deep learning system Inception_v3. These features from the fused MRI scans are used as visual representation for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification model. The proposed approach is evaluated on a sub-study containing 120 participants (aMCI = 61 and cognitively unimpaired = 59) of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study with a baseline model accuracy of 76%. Further evaluation was conducted on the ADNI Phase 1 dataset with 624 participants (aMCI = 397 and cognitively unimpaired = 227) with a baseline model accuracy of 66.27%. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves 90% accuracy and 0.90 F1-Score at classification of aMCI vs. cognitively unimpaired participants on the HNR Study dataset, and 77% accuracy and 0.83 F1-Score on the ADNI dataset."
https://openalex.org/W3088439563,"Passion fruit (Passiflora edulia Sims), an important tropical and subtropical species, is classified as a respiration climacteric fruit, and its quality deteriorates rapidly after harvest. To elucidate the mechanisms involved in ripening and rapid fruit senescence, phytochemical characteristic analysis and RNA sequencing were performed in purple passion fruit with different treatments, that is, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and preservative film (PF). Comprehensive functional annotation and KEGG enrichment analysis showed that starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, and carotenoid biosynthesis were involved in fruit ripening. Treatment with PF and 1-MCP significantly affected the transcription levels of passion fruit during postharvest storage. A large number of differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) were identified as significantly enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis at the postharvest stage. The PF and 1-MCP treatments increased superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) gene expression levels and enzyme activities, accelerated lignin accumulation, and decreased β-galactosidase (β-Gal), polygalacturonase (PG) and cellulose activities and gene expression levels to delay cell wall degradation during fruit senescence. The RNA sequencing data for cell wall metabolism and hormone signal transduction pathway-related unigenes were verified by RT-qPCR. The results of this study indicate that the cell wall metabolism and hormone signaling pathways are closely related to passion fruit ripening. PF and 1-MCP treatment might inhibit ethylene signaling and regulate cell wall metabolism pathways to inhibit cell wall degradation. Our results demonstrate the involvement of ripening- and senescence-related networks in passion fruit ripening and may establish a foundation for future research investigating the effects of PF and 1-MCP treatment on fruit ripening."
https://openalex.org/W3088316654,"Ice storms are a type of extreme winter weather event common to north temperate and boreal forests worldwide. Recent climate modelling studies suggest that these storms may become more frequent and severe under a changing climate. Compared to other types of storm events, relatively little is known about the direct and indirect impacts of these storms on forests, as naturally occurring ice storms are inherently difficult to study. Here we describe a novel experimental approach used to create a suite of ice storms in a mature hardwood forest in New Hampshire, USA. The experiment included five ice storm intensities (0, 6.4, 12.7 and 19.1 mm radial ice accretion) applied in a single year, and one ice storm intensity (12.7 mm) applied in two consecutive years. Results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for creating experimental ice storms, quantify the increase in fine and coarse woody debris mass and nutrients transferred from the forest canopy to the soil under the different icing conditions, and show an increase in the damage to the forest canopy with increasing icing that evolves over time. In this forest, little damage occurred below 6.4 mm radial ice accretion, moderate damage occurred with up to 12.7 mm of accretion, and significant branch breakage and canopy damage occurred with 19.1 mm of ice. The icing in consecutive years demonstrated an interactive effect of ice storm frequency and severity such that some branches damaged in the first year of icing appeared to remain in the canopy and then fall to the ground in the second year of icing. These results have implications for National Weather Service ice storm warning levels, as they provide a quantitative assessment of ice-load related inputs of forest debris that will be useful to municipalities creating response plans for current and future ice storms."
https://openalex.org/W3088400509,"Background Care-seeking for sick children at the Ethiopian primary health care level is low. This problem may partly be due to unfavorable community perceptions of the quality of care provided. There is, however, limited knowledge on the quality of the clinical assessment and management provided by the health extension workers at the health posts. This study aimed to examine the quality of clinical assessment, classification and management provided to sick under-five children by health extension workers in four regions of Ethiopia. Methods Clinical observations of 620 consultations of sick children by health extension workers were conducted from December 2016 to February 2017. A clinical pathway analysis was performed to analyze whether sick children were appropriately assessed, classified and managed according to the integrated Community Case Management guidelines. Results Most sick children presented with complaints of cough (58%), diarrhea (36%), and fever (26%).Three quarters of children with respiratory complaints had their respiratory rate counted (74%, 95% CI 69–78), while a third (33%, 95% CI 27–40) of children with diarrhea were assessed for dehydration. Half (53%, 95% CI 49–57) of the sick children were assessed for general danger signs, while a majority (89%, 95% CI 86–92) had their arm circumference measured for malnutrition. Half of the sick children received some treatment and less than one-fifth were referred according to the integrated Community Case management guidelines. Comprehensive counseling was provided to 38% (95% CI 35–42) of the caregivers. Conclusion The Ethiopian health extension workers’ clinical assessment, classification and management of sick children did to a large extent not follow the clinical guidelines. This lack of adherence could lead to misdiagnoses and lack of potentially life-saving treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3088434633,"Porcine rubulavirus (PRV), which belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, causes blue eye disease in pigs, characterized by encephalitis and reproductive failure in newborn and adult pigs, respectively. There is no effective treatment against PRV and no information on the effectiveness of the available vaccines. Continuous outbreaks have occurred in Mexico since the early 1980s, which have caused serious economic losses to pig producers. Vaccination can be used to control this disease. Searching for effective antigen candidates against PRV, we first sequenced the PAC1 F protein, then we used various immunoinformatics tools to predict antigenic determinants of B-cells and T-cells against the two glycoproteins of the virus (HN and F proteins). Finally, we used AutoDock Vina to determine the binding energies. We obtained the F gene sequence of a PRV strain collected in the early 1990s in Mexico and compared its amino acid profile with previous and more recent strains, obtaining an identity similarity of 97.78 to 99.26%. For the F proteins, seven linear B-cell epitopes, six conformational B-cell epitopes and twenty-nine T-cell MHC class I epitopes were predicted. For the HN proteins, sixteen linear B-cell epitopes, seven conformational B-cell epitopes and thirty-four T-cell MHC class I epitopes were predicted. The ATRSETDYY and AAYTTTTCF epitopes of the HN protein might be important for neutralizing the viral infection. We determined the in silico binding energy between the predicted epitopes on the F and HN proteins and swine MHC-I molecules. The binding energy of these epitopes ranged from -5.8 to -7.8 kcal/mol. The present study aimed to assess the use of HN and F proteins as antigens, either as recombinant proteins or as a series of peptides that could activate different responses of the immune system. This may help identify relevant immunogens, saving time and costs in the development of new vaccines or diagnostic tools."

All but one strains isolated from cardiac surgery-related patients belonged to Subgroup 1.1 (19/23) or Subgroup 1.8 (3/23). Only 28 out of 79 strains isolated from heater-cooler units belonged to groupings other than 1.1 and 1.8. The strains isolated from cardiac surgery-unrelated patients were instead distributed across the phylogenetic tree. Our data, the first on isolates from Italy, are in agreement with a recent large genomic study suggesting a common source, represented by strains belonging to Subgroups 1.1 and 1.8, of cardiac surgery-related Mycobacterium chimaera infections. The strains belonging to groupings other than 1.1 and 1.8 isolated from heather-cooler units evidently resulted from contaminations at hospital level and had no share in the Mycobacterium chimaera outbreak. One Mycobacterium chimaera strain investigated in this study proved distant from every previously known Mycobacterium chimaera Groups (1, 2, 3 and 4) and we propose to assign to a novel group, named ""Group 5""."
https://openalex.org/W3088290737,"Background Visual acuity alone has limitations in assessing a patient’s appropriateness and prioritization for cataract surgery. Several tools, including the Catquest-9SF questionnaire and the electronic cataract appropriateness and priority system (eCAPS) have been developed to evaluate patients–reported visual function as related to day-to-day tasks. The aim of this study was to validate Catquest-9SF and eCAPS in a Canadian population and propose a shorter version of each, in an attempt to extend their applicability in clinical practice. Methods The English translation of the Swedish Catquest-9SF and eCAPS were self-administered separately in pre-operative patients in tertiary care in Peel region, Ontario. Rasch analysis was used to validate both scales and assess their psychometric properties, such as category threshold order, item fit, unidimensionality, precision, targeting, and differential item functioning. Results A total of 313 cataract patients (mean age = 69.1, 56.5% female) completed the Catquest-9SF and eCAPS. Catquest-9SF had ordered response thresholds, adequate precision (person separation index = 2.09, person reliability = 0.81), unidimensionality and no misfits (infit range 0.75–1.35, outfit range 0.83–1.36). There mean for patients was equal to -1.43 (lower than the mean for items which is set automatically at zero), meaning that tasks were relatively easy for respondent ability. eCAPS had 3 items that misfit the Rasch model and were excluded (infit range 0.82–1.30, outfit range 0.75–1.36). Precision was inadequate (person separation index = 0.19, person reliability = 0.04). 78.8% of subjects scored≤9 (answered that they had no issues for most questions). Conclusions Catquest-9SF demonstrated good psychometric properties and is suitable for assessing visual function of care-seeking patients referred for cataract surgery in Ontario, Canada. There was some mistargeting, suggesting that the tasks were relatively easy to perform, which is consistent with previous research. On the contrary, eCAPS is not sensitive in differentiating patients who had impaired visual functioning."

Mutant mice lacking the gene for paraoxonase1 (PON1-/-) are more susceptible to the toxic effects of chlorpyrifos, and were hypothesized to be more vulnerable to social behavior deficits induced by exposure to chlorpyrifos during gestation. Three experiments were performed comparing PON1-/- mice to PON1+/+ mice born to dams treated with 0.5 mg/kg chlorpyrifos or cornoil vehicle on gestational days 12-15. Chlofpyrifos-exposed male PON1-/- mouse pups had delayed development of reflexes in in the first experiment. In the second experiment, adult male and female PON1-/- mice and the female PON1+/+ mice all displayed lower social preference than the male vehicle-treated PON1+/+ mice. The PON1-/- mice and the female PON1+/+ mice displayed lower social preference compared to the PON1+/+ male mice. Male adult mice that had been exposed in utero to chlorpyrifos showed less conditioned social preference regardless of genotype. In the third study, the delayed reflex development was replicated in male and female PON1-/- mice, but chlorpyrifos did not augment this effect. Nest Odor Preference, a test of early social attachment to dam and siblings, was lower in PON1-/- mouse pups compared to PON1+/+ pups. This study shows for the first time that PON1-/- mice have a behavioral phenotype that indicates impaired reflex development and social behavior. Chlorpyrifos exposure during gestation tended to augment some of these effects."
https://openalex.org/W3089217404,"It is known that Wnt/β-catenin signaling induces endochondral ossification and plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA). Sclerostin is a potent inhibitor of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This study investigated the role of sclerostin in the endochondral differentiation under an OA-like condition induced by proinflammatory cytokines. ATDC5 cells were used to investigate chondrogenic differentiation and terminal calcification, and 10 ng/ml IL-1β and/or 200 ng/ml sclerostin were added to the culture medium. IL-1β impaired early chondrogenesis from undifferentiated state into proliferative chondrocytes, and it was not altered by sclerostin. IL-1β induced progression of chondrogenic differentiation in the late stage and promoted terminal calcification. These processes were inhibited by sclerostin and chondrogenic phenotype was restored. In addition, sclerostin restored IL-1β-induced upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the late stage. This study provides insights into the possible role of sclerostin in the chondrogenic differentiation under the IL-1β-induced OA-like environment. Suppression of Wnt signaling by an antagonist may play a key role in the maintenance of articular homeostasis and has a potential to prevent the progression of OA. Thus, sclerostin is a candidate treatment option for OA."
https://openalex.org/W3089249675,"Introduction Globally, pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children which leads to over 156 million episodes and 14.9 million hospitalizations each year. Besides this fact, the recovery time and predictors of children’s hospitalization related to severe community-acquired pneumonia is not well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate the median time to recovery and its predictors among severe community-acquired pneumonia patients admitted to the pediatric ward, Debre Markos referral hospital, North West Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was employed among 352 records of children who were admitted starting from January 2016 to December 2018. Patients' charts were retrieved using a structured data extraction tool. Cox proportional hazard model assumption and model fitness was checked. Stratified Cox regression was fitted as a final model. Hazard ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used and P-value < 0.05 was considered as a statistically significant association. Result The overall median recovery time was 4 days IQR (3–7). Recovery rate from severe community acquired pneumonia was 16.25 (95% CI: 14.54–18.15) per 100 person day observation. Age (AHR; 0.94 95% CI (0.90–0.98)), being stunted (AHR; 0.62 95% CI (0.43–0.91)), presence of danger sign at admission (AHR; 0.61 95% CI (0.40–0.94)), late presentation to seek care(AHR; 0.64 95% CI (0.47–0.88)) and co-morbidity (AHR; 0.45 95% CI (0.35–0.58)) were significant predictors of recovery time. Conclusion The median recovery time from severe community-acquired pneumonia was long so that measures to reduce recovery time should be strengthened."
https://openalex.org/W3089271630,"Grass carp is an important commercial fish widely cultivated in China. A wide range of temperatures, particularly extremely low temperatures, have dramatic effects on the aquaculture of this teleost. However, relatively few studies have characterized the molecular responses of grass carp exposed to acute cooling in natural environment. Here, we investigated the transcriptome profiles of the grass carp brain in response to cooling. Through regulation pattern analyses, we identified 2,513 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that responded to moderate cold stress (12°C), while 99 DEGs were induced by severe low temperature (4°C).The pathway analyses revealed that the DEGs sensitive to moderate cold were largely enriched in steroid biosynthesis, spliceosome, translation, protein metabolism, phagosome, gap junction and estrogen signaling pathways. Additionally, we discerned genes most likely involved in low temperature tolerance, of which the MAPK signaling pathway was dominantly enriched. Further examination and characterization of the candidate genes may help to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning extreme plasticity to severe cold stress in grass carp."
https://openalex.org/W3087827943,"Widespread availability of antibiotics without prescription potentially facilitates overuse and contributes to selection pressure for antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Prior to this study, anecdotal observations in Guatemala identified corner stores as primary antibiotic dispensaries, where people purchase antibiotics without prescriptions. We carried out a cross sectional study to document the number and types of antibiotics available in corner stores, in four study areas in Guatemala. A total of 443 corner stores were surveyed, of which 295 (67%) sold antibiotics. The most commonly available antibiotics were amoxicillin, found in 246/295 (83%) stores, and tetracycline, found in 195/295 (66%) stores. Over the counter sales result from laissez-faire enforcement of antibiotic dispensing regulations in Guatemala combined with patient demand. This study serves as a baseline to document changes in the availability of antibiotics in informal establishments in light of new pharmacy regulations for antibiotic dispensing, which were adopted after this study was completed."
https://openalex.org/W3087973071,"Adoptive cell transfer of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells showed promising results in patients with B cell malignancies. However, the detailed mechanism of CAR-T cell interaction with the target tumor cells is still not well understood. This work provides a systematic method for analyzing the activation and degranulation of second-generation CAR-T cells utilizing antigen-presenting cell surfaces. Antigen-presenting cell surfaces composed of circular micropatterns of CAR-specific anti-idiotype antibodies have been developed to mimic the interaction of CAR-T cells with target tumor cells using micro-contact printing. The levels of activation and degranulation of fixed non-transduced T cells (NT), CD19.CAR-T cells, and GD2.CAR-T cells on the antigen-presenting cell surfaces were quantified and compared by measuring the intensity of the CD3ζ chain phosphorylation and the Lysosome-Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP-1), respectively. The size and morphology of the cells were also measured. The intracellular Ca2+ flux of NT and CAR-T cells upon engagement with the antigen-presenting cell surface was reported. Results suggest that NT and CD19.CAR-T cells have comparable activation levels, while NT have higher degranulation levels than CD19.CAR-T cells and GD2.CAR-T cells. The findings show that antigen-presenting cell surfaces allow a quantitative analysis of the molecules involved in synapse formation in different CAR-T cells in a systematic, reproducible manner."
https://openalex.org/W3088132968,"Adventitious root formation is essential for plant propagation, development, and response to various stresses. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for adventitious root formation. However, information on Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog (RBOH), a key enzyme that catalyzes the production ROS, remains limited in woody plants. Here, a total of 44 RBOH genes were identified from six Rosaceae species (Malus domestica, Prunus avium, Prunus dulcis 'Texas’, Rubus occidentalis, Fragaria vesca and Rosa chinensis), including ten from M. domestica. Their phylogenetic relationships, conserved motifs and gene structures were analyzed. Exogenous treatment with the RBOH protein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) completely inhibited adventitious root formation, whereas exogenous H2O2 treatment enhanced adventitious root formation. In addition, we found that ROS accumulated during adventitious root primordium inducing process. The expression levels of MdRBOH-H, MdRBOH-J, MdRBOH-A, MdRBOH-E1 and MdRBOH-K increased more than two-fold at days 3 or 9 after auxin treatment. In addition, cis-acting element analysis revealed that the MdRBOH-E1 promoter contained an auxin-responsive element and the MdRBOH-K promoter contained a meristem expression element. Based on the combined results from exogenous DPI and H2O2 treatment, spatiotemporal expression profiling, and cis-element analysis, MdRBOH-E1 and MdRBOH-K appear to be candidates for the control of adventitious rooting in apple."

The objective of this study was to investigate changes in behavioral performance and cortical auditory responses following cochlear implantation. Design Prospective longitudinal study. Setting Tertiary referral center. Methods Six adults with SSD were tested before and 12 months post-activation of the CI. Six normal hearing (NH) participants served as experimental controls. Speech understanding in noise was evaluated for various spatial conditions. Cortical auditory evoked potentials were recorded with /ba/ stimuli in quiet and in noise. Global field power and responses at Cz were analyzed. Results Speech understanding in noise significantly improved with the CI when speech was presented to the CI ear and noise to the normal ear (p<0.05), but remained poorer than that of NH controls (p<0.05). N1 peak amplitude measure in noise significantly increased after CI activation (p<0.05), but remained lower than that of NH controls (p<0.05) at 12 months. After 12 months of CI experience, cortical responses in noise became more comparable between groups. Conclusion Binaural restoration in SSD patients via cochlear implantation improved speech performance noise and cortical responses. While behavioral performance and cortical auditory responses improved, SSD-CI outcomes remained poorer than that of NH controls in most cases, suggesting only partial restoration of binaural hearing."

The current study is aimed to decipher the genetic basis of Leber congenital Amaurosis (LCA), Anterior Segment dysgenesis (ASD), and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), segregating in four large consanguineous Pakistani families. The exome sequencing followed by segregation analysis via Sanger sequencing revealed the LCA phenotypes segregating in families GCUF01 and GCUF04 can be attributed to c.465G>T (p.(Gln155His)) missense and novel c.139_140delinsA p.(Pro47Trhfster38) frameshift variant of AIPL1 and GUCY2D, respectively. The c.1843A>T (p.(Lys615*) truncating allele of MERTK is homozygous in all the affected individuals, presumably suffering with RP, of the GCUF02 family. Meanwhile, co-segregation of the ASD phenotype and the c.289A>G (p.(Ile97Val)) variant of FOXE3 was found in the GCUF06 family. All the identified variants were either absent or present in very low frequencies in the control databases. Our in-silico analyses and 3D molecular modeling support the deleterious impact of these variants on the encoded proteins. Variants identified in MERTK, GUCY2D, and FOXE3 were categorized as ""pathogenic"" or ""likely pathogenic"", while the missense variant found in AIPL1 was deemed to have ""uncertain significance"" based upon the variant pathogenicity guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). This paper highlights the genetic diversity of vision disorders in the Pakistani population and reports the identification of four novel mutations in families who segregate clinically heterogeneous eye diseases. Our results give insight into the genotype-phenotype correlations of AIPL1, FOXE3, MERTK, and GUCY2D variants."
https://openalex.org/W3089032154,"Diffusion-weighted MRI makes it possible to quantify subvoxel brain microstructure and to reconstruct white matter fiber trajectories with which structural connectomes can be created. However, at the border between cerebrospinal fluid and white matter, or in the presence of edema, the obtained MRI signal originates from both the cerebrospinal fluid as well as from the white matter partial volume. Diffusion tractography can be strongly influenced by these free water partial volume effects. Thus, including a free water model can improve diffusion tractography in glioma patients. Here, we analyze how including a free water model influences structural connectivity estimates in healthy subjects as well as in brain tumor patients. During a clinical study, we acquired diffusion MRI data of 35 glioma patients and 28 age- and sex-matched controls, on which we applied an open-source deep learning based free water model. We performed deterministic as well as probabilistic tractography before and after free water modeling, and utilized the tractograms to create structural connectomes. Finally, we performed a quantitative analysis of the connectivity matrices. In our experiments, the number of tracked diffusion streamlines increased by 13% for high grade glioma patients, 9.25% for low grade glioma, and 7.65% for healthy controls. Intra-subject similarity of hemispheres increased significantly for the patient as well as for the control group, with larger effects observed in the patient group. Furthermore, inter-subject differences in connectivity between brain tumor patients and healthy subjects were reduced when including free water modeling. Our results indicate that free water modeling increases the similarity of connectivity matrices in brain tumor patients, while the observed effects are less pronounced in healthy subjects. As the similarity between brain tumor patients and healthy controls also increased, connectivity changes in brain tumor patients may have been overestimated in studies that did not perform free water modeling."
https://openalex.org/W3088280929,"We found the mineralization of Cu during long-term Cu2+ adsorption onto dry baker’s yeast cells phosphorylated using sodium cyclo-triphosphate. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed that the elemental composition of minerals were copper, phosphorus, and oxygen. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure showed that the local structure around Cu atoms deposited on the mineral was almost identical to that of commercial copper (II) phosphate Cu3(PO4)2∙3H2O. However, the crystallinity was low, and the structure was slightly distorted. Time profile analysis using FESEM revealed that copper phosphate mineralization was first apparent on Day 3 of adsorption, whereas mineral formation plateaued at around Day 7. It seems that mineralization occurs by the local saturation of phosphate and Cu2+ on the yeast cells. Mineralization of the rare earth ion Dy3+ was also demonstrated during long-term adsorption. Mineralization on phosphorylated yeast cells appears to follow a common path for various types of metal ions and provides a promising technique for metal recovery via irreversible adsorption."
https://openalex.org/W3088531213,"Parental care elevates reproductive success by allocating resources into the upbringing of the offspring. However, it also imposes strong costs for the care-giving parent and can foster sexual dimorphism. Trade-offs between the reproductive system and the immune system may result in differential immunological capacities between the care-providing and the non-care-providing parent. Usually, providing care is restricted to the female sex making it impossible to study a sex-independent influence of parental investment on sexual immune dimorphism. The decoupling of sex-dependent parental investment and their influences on the parental immunological capacity, however, is possible in syngnathids, which evolved the unique male pregnancy on a gradient ranging from a simple carrying of eggs on the trunk (Nerophinae, low paternal investment) to full internal pregnancy (Syngnathus, high paternal investment). In this study, we compared candidate gene expression between females and males of different gravity stages in three species of syngnathids (Syngnathus typhle, Syngnathus rostellatus and Nerophis ophidion) with different male pregnancy intensities to determine how parental investment influences sexual immune dimorphism. While our data failed to detect sexual immune dimorphism in the subset of candidate genes assessed, we show a parental care specific resource-allocation trade-off between investment into pregnancy and immune defense when parental care is provided."

An extreme low-seawater temperature event in late January and February 2008 resulted in high fish mortality in the coastal waters of the Penghu Islands, Taiwan. In this study, we used underwater diving visual censuses to analyze fish communities at eight sampling stations along the coast of the Penghu Islands for seven years after the 2008 event. We evaluated community metrics, including species richness, abundance-weighted diversity, average thermal affinity, and average trophic level, and described the temporal variation in select dominant species abundances. Species richness and diversity of the communities required 53 months to reach a steady-state at the sampling stations following the cold water intrusion. The cold event initially reduced community thermal affinity, which then increased throughout the study period, reflecting the recovery of the community to baseline thermal conditions. The increased average trophic level after the cold event implied that the temperature shock decreased the proportion of lower trophic-level fishes. Average trophic level declined as the communities recovered from the disturbance, reflecting the recovery of the community to baseline species composition in terms of feeding habit. Our results suggest that functional diversity may require longer to recover than taxonomic diversity for communities in the Penghu Islands."

This justifies tracking the progress on two important indicators 'spousal violence' and 'maternal health care utilization' to improve maternal health and achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for these nations.The objective of this study is to compare the data from the latest two Demographic Health Surveys of Pakistan to identify trends in prevalence of various forms of spousal violence and maternal healthcare utilization and to determine the predictive role of spousal violence in poor maternal health.We conducted a retrospective analysis of nationally representative data from the 2012-13 and 2017-18 PDHS. The data used in this analysis is from the domestic violence module and core women's questionnaire. Spousal violence and sociodemographic background were predictor variables. Terminated pregnancy, number of pregnancy losses, number of antenatal visits for last birth and institutional delivery for last birth were taken as indicators of maternal health. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to test for association between maternal health indicators and various forms of spousal violence after controlling for sociodemographic variables.Almost one quarter of women experienced physical and emotional violence as revealed by both surveys. Binary analysis revealed that all forms of spousal violence significantly associate with maternal health variables in both surveys. The comparison of results on logistic regression analysis showed that odd ratios were relatively higher for 2012-13 as compared to 2017-18 PDHS. Logistic regression analysis from 2017-18 data showed that experience of less severe physical violence (OR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.08-1.47), severe physical violence (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.83), sexual violence (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.02-1.89), physical violence during pregnancy (OR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07-1.76) augment the risk of terminated pregnancy. Emotional violence decreases the likelihood for institutional delivery (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.93) and above than four antenatal visits (OR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.79).Strategies to prevent spousal violence should be at the core of maternal health programs because health sector provides a platform to challenge social norms and promote attitudes that disapprove spousal violence which are essential for promoting gender equality, women empowerment (SDG 3) and improve maternal health (SDG 5)."

Modern accelerometers can record continuous observations on a single individual for several days at a sampling frequency of the order of one hertz. Such rich and lengthy data sets provide new opportunities for statistical insight, but also pose challenges in selecting from a wide range of possible summary statistics, and how the calculation of such statistics should be optimally tuned and implemented. In this paper, we build on existing approaches, as well as propose new summary statistics, and detail how these should be implemented with high frequency accelerometry data. We test and validate our methods on an observed data set from 26 recordings from individuals with advanced dementia and 14 recordings from individuals without dementia. We study four metrics: Interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV), the scaling exponent from detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a novel nonparametric estimator which we call the proportion of variance (PoV), which calculates the strength of the circadian rhythm using spectral density estimation. We perform a detailed analysis indicating how the time series should be optimally subsampled to calculate IV, and recommend a subsampling rate of approximately 5 minutes for the dataset that has been studied. In addition, we propose the use of the DFA scaling exponent separately for daytime and nighttime, to further separate effects between individuals. We compare the relationships between all these methods and show that they effectively capture different features of the time series."
https://openalex.org/W3088375712,"How do candidates’ status and social proximity to members of the evaluating audience interact to shape recognition in peer-based evaluative settings? In this study, we shed light on this question by adopting a mixed-method approach. We first examined field data on the conferral of awards in a peer-based evaluative contest–“The Silver Tag”–which is one of the most prestigious digital advertising awards contests in Norway. The field study revealed the existence of a negative interaction between status and social proximity on the allocation of awards. We then conducted two experiments to probe the mechanisms responsible for this finding. In the first experiment, we replicated the main pattern observed in the field study. In the second experiment, we showed that the interaction effect is contingent on the nature of the evaluative setting. When audience members’ decisions were in the public domain (i.e., the other audience members knew them), social proximity tempered the effect of status on candidates’ recognition, but it did not when decisions were private (i.e., the other audience members did not know them). We conclude by discussing several implications of our study for research on the socio-psychological processes underlying evaluative outcomes in tournament rituals."
https://openalex.org/W3088623542,"Flash-cooling of macromolecular crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis is usually performed in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Cryogens different than LN2 are used as well for this procedure but are highly underrepresented, e.g., liquid propane and liquid ethane. These two cryogens have significantly higher cooling rates compared with LN2 and may thus be beneficial for flash-cooling of macromolecular crystals. Flash-cooling in liquid propane or liquid ethane results in sample vitrification but is accompanied by solidification of these cryogens, which is not compatible with the robotic systems nowadays used for crystal mounting at most synchrotrons. Here we provide a detailed description of a new double-chambered device and procedure to flash-cool loop mounted macromolecular crystals in different cryogenic liquids. The usage of this device may result in specimens of better crystal- and optical quality in terms of mosaic spread and ice contamination. Furthermore, applying the described procedure with the new double-chambered device provides the possibility to screen for the best flash-cooling cryogen for macromolecular crystals on a routine basis, and, most importantly, the samples obtained allow the usage of state-of-the-art robotic sample-loading systems at synchrotrons."
https://openalex.org/W3089153641,"The Zigzag ladybird beetle, Cheilomenes sexmaculata (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), is a biological control agent that feeds on a variety of aphid species. Life table and predation data of C. sexmaculata were collected under laboratory conditions at 25±2⁰C, 60±5% RH and L14: D10 h in connection with feeding on four different aphid species; Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach), Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Aphis nerii (Boyer de Fonscolombe) and Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko). Larval development of C. sexmaculata was long when fed on M. persicae (12.18 days) and shorter on D. noxia (10.64 days). The male’s lifespan was longer on M. persicae (26.70 days) and shorter on L. erysimi (23.67 days). Fecundity was maximum when the beetle was fed D. noxia (316.8 eggs/female) and minimum on M. persicae (199.1 eggs/female). Net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate of increase were highest on D. noxia with values of 158.4 (offspring individual-1), 0.22 d-1, and 1.24 d-1, respectively whereas the respective parameters were lowest on L. erysimi (99.5 offspring individual-1, 0.19 d-1, and 1.20 d-1, respectively). However, the mean of the generation (T) was shorter on A. nerii (22.48 d-1) and longer on M. persicae (24.68 d-1). Based on life table parameters obtained under laboratory conditions, the most appropriate host of C. sexmaculata was D. noxia. This study should help us to improve mass rearing and use of C. sexmaculata in the biological control of aphids on field and horticultural crops."
https://openalex.org/W3087813333,"Low carnitine status may underlie the development of insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility. Intravenous lipid infusion elevates plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration and is a model for simulating insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility in healthy, insulin sensitive volunteers. Here, we hypothesized that co-infusion of L-carnitine may alleviate lipid-induced insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility.In a randomized crossover trial, eight young healthy volunteers underwent hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (40mU/m2/min) with simultaneous infusion of saline (CON), Intralipid (20%, 90mL/h) (LIPID), or Intralipid (20%, 90mL/h) combined with L-carnitine infusion (28mg/kg) (LIPID+CAR). Ten volunteers were randomized for the intervention arms (CON, LIPID and LIPID+CAR), but two dropped-out during the study. Therefore, eight volunteers participated in all three intervention arms and were included for analysis.L-carnitine infusion elevated plasma free carnitine availability and resulted in a more pronounced increase in plasma acetylcarnitine, short-, medium-, and long-chain acylcarnitines compared to lipid infusion, however no differences in skeletal muscle free carnitine or acetylcarnitine were found. Peripheral insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility were blunted upon lipid infusion compared to CON but L-carnitine infusion did not alleviate this.Acute L-carnitine infusion could not alleviated lipid-induced insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility and did not alter skeletal muscle carnitine availability. Possibly, lipid-induced insulin resistance may also have affected carnitine uptake and may have blunted the insulin-induced carnitine storage in muscle. Future studies are needed to investigate this."
https://openalex.org/W3087840816,"The aim of the current study was to investigate how cerebral and splanchnic oxygen saturation (rSO2-C and rSO2-A) in critically ill children transported in air ambulance was affected by flight with cabin pressurization corresponding to ≥ 5000 feet. A second aim was to investigate any differences between cyanotic and non-cyanotic children in relation to cerebral and splanchnic oxygen saturation during flight ≥ 5000 feet. The variability of the cerebral and splanchnic Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors was evaluated.NIRS was used to measure rSO2-C and rSO2-A during transport of critically ill children in air ambulance. rSO2 data was collected and stored by the NIRS monitor and extracted and analyzed off-line after the transport. Prior to evaluation of the NIRS signals all zero and floor-effect values were removed.The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden.In total, 44 critically ill children scheduled for inter-hospital transport by a specialized pediatric transport team were included in the study between January 2014 and January 2019 (convenience sampling).No interventions were conducted.All study patients were monitored with a cerebral NIRS-sensor placed over the forehead and an abdominal NIRS-sensor placed in the infra-umbilical area for cerebral and splanchnic regional oxygen saturation monitoring, rSO2-C and rSO2-A, respectively.Complete rSO2-C and rSO2-A data was obtained in 39 patients. Median age was 12 days. Cyanotic congenital heart malformations were present in 9 patients (23%). In 22 patients (56%) rSO2-C decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet and in 24 patients (61%) rSO2-A decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet compared to baseline (p<0.0001). In 25 patients (64%) the rSO2-C/rSO2-A ratio was greater at altitude ≥ 5000 feet than at baseline. A ratio ≥ 1 was seen in 77% of patients at altitude ≥ 5000 feet compared to in 67% of patients at baseline.Both cerebral and splanchnic oxygen saturation decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet compared to baseline. In most patients, both cyanotic and non-cyanotic, cerebral oxygen saturation was preserved more than splanchnic oxygen saturation."
