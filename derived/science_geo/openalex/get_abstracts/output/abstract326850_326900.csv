https://openalex.org/W2080191389,"X-ray and neutron-diffraction data were combined for study of deviations from spherical symmetry of the atomic charge distributions in the small organic molecule s-triazine. The results indicate that density has migrated from the atomic regions into the bonds and into the nitrogen lone-pair region. Refinement procedures for x-ray data, which do not take these bonding effects into account, give parameters containing small but measurable errors."
https://openalex.org/W2020545416,"New Zealand, like many other islands, has suffered extinctions of native species and successful introductions of exotic species. It has been uncertain whether the introductions caused the extinctions or whether the extinctions permitted the introductions. On New Zealand's Hauraki Gulf islands, which are unusual in their near lack of introduced mammalian predators and complete lack of mammalian browsers, exotic bird species abundant in mainland New Zealand forest and reaching these islands are virtually absent from unmodified forest. Exotic bird species disappeared from Cuvier Island's forest after elimination of mammalian predators and browsers. Hence extinctions of native species were not due to competition from introduced species but to other factors (such as mammalian predators and habitat alteration). Only after decimation of native species and forest alteration by browsing mammals could exotic birds invade forest."
https://openalex.org/W2029320873,"Treatment with gibberellic acid, at concentrations as low as 10(-7)M, of intact tomato fruits, or of pieces in tissue culture, markedly retarded ripening in terms of development of redness. Ethylene stimulations of color development were prevented by treatment with gibberellic acid, but ethylene stimulations of respiration were not. Gibberellin can delay the progress of some components of the ripening of fruit, preventing some of the changes triggered by ethylene."
https://openalex.org/W2033274712,"Larger species of seed-eating desert rodents were excluded from experimental plots while smaller, potentially competing species were allowed to enter. Density of small granivores on these plots increased to nearly 3.5 times that on control plots but only after 8 months. These results indicate that interspecific competition affects the abundance of desert rodents; they also support indirect evidence that competition for seeds influences the organization of desert rodent communities."
https://openalex.org/W2024406869,"Southwestern Colombia and northern Ecuador were shaken by a shal-low-focus earthquake on 12 December 1979. The magnitude 8 shock, located near Tumaco, Colombia, was the largest in northwestern South America since 1942 and had been forecast to fill a seismic gap. Thrust faulting occurred on a 280- by 130-kilometer rectangular patch of a subduction zone that dips east beneath the Pacific coast of Colombia. A 200-kilometer stretch of the coast tectonically subsided as much as 1.6 meters; uplift occurred offshore on the continental slope. A tsunami swept inland immediately after the earthquake. Ground shaking (intensity VI to IX) caused many buildings to collapse and generated liquefaction in sand fills and in Holocene beach, lagoonal, and fluvial deposits."
https://openalex.org/W2021085413,Density measurements on liquid sulfur near the transition at 160Â°C show a logarithmic singularity and discontinuous density. The transition shows the kinetic behavior of a zero-order reaction. The transition is expected to have a latent heat characteristic of a first-order phase transition but is of the cooperative nature associated with second-order transitions such as the lambda point in liquid helium.
https://openalex.org/W2039032999,"Early Proterozoic microfossils from the Sokoman Iron Formation, northeastern Canada, are indistinguishable from those of the Gunflint Formation in both morphology and inferred community structure. The contemporaneity of the Sokoman assemblage with the Bitter Springs-like cyanobacteria of the Belcher Supergroup indicates that differences between the two major types of early Proterozoic microbiotas are primarily ecological and not temporal (evolutionary) in nature. In arenaceous iron formations, microfossils are restricted to peloids and are absent from pore-filling silica interpreted as cement. Cemented arenaceous intraclasts indicate that some of the silica was penecontemporaneous, and the abundance of minus-cement porosity in arenaceous iron formations demonstrates that early (pre-compaction) cementation was common."
https://openalex.org/W2043508413,"A possible approach to the understanding of electronic properties of amorphous materials is to compare them with the corresponding crystalline materials, whose properties have been well explained. This approach has been exploited in the simple case of amorphous germanium, and I have indicated how the observed optical properties can be used to obtain information on the changes of electronic states, and what complications arise when we try to understand the transport properties."
https://openalex.org/W2042478840,"The two-filter method described by Thomas and LeClare was used to investigate the effects of trace concentrations of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide in dry nitrogen on the diffusion coefficient of radium A (polonium-218). Charged radium A was neutralized in 10 parts per million (ppm) nitrogen dioxide in dry nitrogen, in 8.3 ppm nitric oxide in dry 92 percent nitrogen and 8 percent oxygen, and in nitrogen with 20 and 80 percent relative humidity. No neutralization was seen in dry nitrogen, dry oxygen, dry air, or 10 ppm nitric oxide in dry nitrogen. The diffusion coefficient of the neutral radium A species was found to be 0.079 square centimeters per second, regardless of the relative humidity of the nitrogen gas atmosphere. Lower values were observed for charged species."
https://openalex.org/W1985591100,"Lakes may be acid because of natural ecological conditions or because of anthropogenic activities. Apparently there has been a recent increase in acidity of many lakes in the northeastern United States. Factors that may be contributing to this increase include the use by utilities of precipitators, sulfur scrubbers, and tall stacks; the use of petroleum; and methods of combustion of fossil fuels."
https://openalex.org/W1998731867,"High-resolution photographs returned by Orbiters II and III typically show a surface pitted with small, perfectly circular craters as much as 50 meters in diameter, some of which are strongly clustered; these are superposed on larger, generally shallower craters and must be a mixture of primary and secondary impact craters. Rough terrain is less heavily cratered but is crossed by numerous closely spaced troughs and ridges up to 3 meters high. Terraces, which commonly occur at the base of steep slopes, are also crossed by these troughs and ridges and have relatively few craters. Fresh craters-craters whose exterior slopes are covered with material different from that of the intercrater areas-are rare and are surrounded by angular blocks up to 80 meters in diameter, in varying numbers; these craters apparently undergo gradual destruction to shallow gentle depressions. The frequency of craters 100 meters and more in diameter varies widely, even on level terrain; some of the highest concentrations of craters occur on rays."
https://openalex.org/W2029077863,"An experiment performed on a differentially rotating, density-stratified fluid shows that ""spin-down"" need not occur under the condition of stratification. Inasmuch as density stratification occurs in the interior of the sun, spin-down probably does not exist in the solar interior, and the observed solar oblateness may indicate that the sun contains a rapidly spinning core."
https://openalex.org/W2029590573,"Isolated mesophyll cells from leaflets of Arachis hypogaea can be cultured in a simple, defined liquid nutrient medium containing minerals, with an appropriate source of ammonia, sugar, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, and kinetin. The significance of such a simple medium in understanding the problems of cell metabolism, growth, and morphogenesis is discussed."
