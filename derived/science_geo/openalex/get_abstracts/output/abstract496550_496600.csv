https://openalex.org/W2073188416,"Patterned spontaneous activity is a hallmark of developing sensory systems. In the auditory system, rhythmic bursts of spontaneous activity are generated in cochlear hair cells and propagated along central auditory pathways. The role of these activity patterns in the development of central auditory circuits has remained speculative. Here we demonstrate that blocking efferent cholinergic neurotransmission to developing hair cells in mice that lack the α9 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α9 KO mice) altered the temporal fine structure of spontaneous activity without changing activity levels. KO mice showed a severe impairment in the functional and structural sharpening of an inhibitory tonotopic map, as evidenced by deficits in synaptic strengthening and silencing of connections and an absence in axonal pruning. These results provide evidence that the precise temporal pattern of spontaneous activity before hearing onset is crucial for the establishment of precise tonotopy, the major organizing principle of central auditory pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1997769166,"The increasing capabilities and ubiquity of mobile phones and their associated digital cameras offer the possibility of extending low-cost, portable diagnostic microscopy to underserved and low-resource areas. However, mobile phone microscopes created by adding magnifying optics to the phone's camera module have been unable to make use of the full image sensor due to the specialized design of the embedded camera lens, exacerbating the tradeoff between resolution and field of view inherent to optical systems. This tradeoff is acutely felt for diagnostic applications, where the speed and cost of image-based diagnosis is related to the area of the sample that can be viewed at sufficient resolution. Here we present a simple and low-cost approach to mobile phone microscopy that uses a reversed mobile phone camera lens added to an intact mobile phone to enable high quality imaging over a significantly larger field of view than standard microscopy. We demonstrate use of the reversed lens mobile phone microscope to identify red and white blood cells in blood smears and soil-transmitted helminth eggs in stool samples."

Here, we perform a systematic investigation of the role of both de novo and inherited LOF variants in schizophrenia using exome sequencing data from 231 case and 34 control trios. We identify two de novo LOF variants in the SETD1A gene, which encodes a subunit of histone methyltransferase, a finding unlikely to have occurred by chance, and provide evidence for a more general role of chromatin regulators in schizophrenia risk. Transmission pattern analyses reveal that LOF variants are more likely to be transmitted to affected individuals than controls. This is especially true for private LOF variants in genes intolerant to functional genetic variation. These findings highlight the contribution of LOF mutations to the genetic architecture of schizophrenia and provide important insights into disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966075779,"To evaluate the performance of Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) in detecting undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes among U.S. adults by gender and race.This cross-sectional analysis included participants (aged ≥20 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2010. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the optimal cutoff points for identifying undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes were calculated for FINDRISC by gender and race/ethnicity.Among the 20,633 adults (≥20 years), 49.8% were women and 53.0% were non-Hispanic White. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes was 4.1% and 35.6%, respectively. FINDRISC was positively associated with the prevalence of diabetes (OR = 1.48 for 1 unit increase, p<0.001) and prediabetes (OR = 1.15 for 1 unit increase, p<0.001). The area under ROC for detecting undiagnosed diabetes was 0.75 for total population, 0.74 for men and 0.78 for women (p = 0.04); 0.76 for White, 0.76 for Black and 0.72 for Hispanics (p = 0.03 for White vs. Hispanics). The area under ROC for detecting prediabetes was 0.67 for total population, 0.66 for men and 0.70 for women (p<0.001); 0.68 for White, 0.67 for Black and 0.65 for Hispanics (p<0.001 for White vs. Hispanics). The optimal cutoff point was 10 (sensitivity = 0.75) for men and 12 (sensitivity = 0.72) for women for detecting undiagnosed diabetes; 9 (sensitivity = 0.61) for men and 10 (sensitivity = 0.69) for women for detecting prediabetes.FINDRISC is a simple and non-invasive screening tool to identify individuals at high risk for diabetes in the U.S. adults."
https://openalex.org/W2065525345,"""Media events"" such as political debates generate conditions of shared attention as many users simultaneously tune in with the dual screens of broadcast and social media to view and participate. Are collective patterns of user behavior under conditions of shared attention distinct from other ""bursts"" of activity like breaking news events? Using data from a population of approximately 200,000 politically-active Twitter users, we compare features of their behavior during eight major events during the 2012 U.S. presidential election to examine (1) the impact of ""media events"" have on patterns of social media use compared to ""typical"" time and (2) whether changes during media events are attributable to changes in behavior across the entire population or an artifact of changes in elite users' behavior. Our findings suggest that while this population became more active during media events, this additional activity reflects concentrated attention to a handful of users, hashtags, and tweets. Our work is the first study on distinguishing patterns of large-scale social behavior under condition of uncertainty and shared attention, suggesting new ways of mining information from social media to support collective sensemaking following major events."

Academic and public interest in tDCS has been fueled by strong claims of therapeutic and enhancement effects. We report a rising tide of tDCS coverage in the media, while regulatory action is lacking and ethical issues need to be addressed. Neurostimulation has a long history of attracting academic and public attention. The Egyptians knew about the electric properties of catfish (Finger, 1994Finger S. Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar), but it is unclear if (and how) they experimented with them for clinical purposes. Both Plato and Aristotle described the ability of the torpedo fish to generate numbing effects via its electric discharge (Finger, 1994Finger S. Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Later writings from Scribonius Largus, Pliny the Elder, and Galen of Pergamum detail the use of live torpedo fish to treat headaches (Priori, 2003Priori A. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 114: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The Romans went beyond scholarly interest by cultivating the fish for explicit therapeutic purposes, as evidenced by a frescoed store front that marketed their use to the public in Pompeii (Finger, 1994Finger S. Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations into Brain Function. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Other therapeutic uses of brain stimulation were reported by Ibn-Sidah, an 11th century physician, who suggested using an electric catfish to treat epilepsy (Brunoni et al., 2012Brunoni A.R. Nitsche M.A. Bolognini N. Bikson M. Wagner T. Merabet L. Edwards D.J. Valero-Cabre A. Rotenberg A. Pascual-Leone A. et al.Brain Stimulat. 2012; 5: 175-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). With the advent of electrophysiology in the 1700s, direct current began to be used in clinical settings for the treatment of melancholia (Priori, 2003Priori A. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 114: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). These advances drew significant public interest and generated discussion about their philosophical and ethical implications (e.g., Shelley’s Frankenstein). Early interventions involving electrical stimulation of the brain used direct current (DC) (as opposed to alternating current [AC] or magnetic fields, which were both introduced toward the end of 19th century). Ancient therapeutic practices as bizarre as applying a live torpedo fish to the scalp to cure headaches could thus qualify as a crude form of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): they were transcranial (as opposed to intracranial), they used DC, and the desired effect was brain stimulation. Modern-day tDCS devices use weak electrical current (0.5–2 mA, such as that provided by a 9 V battery) and at least two electrodes placed on the scalp to facilitate or inhibit spontaneous neuronal activity. Although this effect is poorly understood, it is theorized that tDCS may induce long-term potentiation (LTP), a process thought to contribute to learning (Stagg and Nitsche, 2011Stagg C.J. Nitsche M.A. Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The effects of tDCS seem to be most pronounced when combined with a training paradigm (Hamilton et al., 2011Hamilton R. Messing S. Chatterjee A. Neurology. 2011; 76: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It is known that tDCS acts by polarizing the resting membrane potential, the effects of which can last for up to 1 hr (Priori, 2003Priori A. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 114: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Given that tDCS causes a constant electric field that displaces all electrically charged molecules and that most neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain have electrical properties, tDCS might induce prolonged neurochemical changes that are as of yet unknown (see Brunoni et al., 2012Brunoni A.R. Nitsche M.A. Bolognini N. Bikson M. Wagner T. Merabet L. Edwards D.J. Valero-Cabre A. Rotenberg A. Pascual-Leone A. et al.Brain Stimulat. 2012; 5: 175-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of action of tDCS could involve different synaptic and nonsynaptic effects on neurons, nonneuronal cells (e.g., glia), and tissues within the brain (Brunoni et al., 2012Brunoni A.R. Nitsche M.A. Bolognini N. Bikson M. Wagner T. Merabet L. Edwards D.J. Valero-Cabre A. Rotenberg A. Pascual-Leone A. et al.Brain Stimulat. 2012; 5: 175-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). The long-lasting effects of tDCS may also depend on protein synthesis, since anodal stimulation appears to increase intraneuronal levels of calcium as well as the expression of genes responsible for neurotransmitter receptors (see Stagg and Nitsche, 2011Stagg C.J. Nitsche M.A. Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). In modern times, the persistent challenge of treating complex conditions such as epilepsy, chronic pain, and headaches has served as a catalyst for the development of neurostimulation techniques. The success of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment for psychiatric disorders in the mid-1900s largely pushed techniques using weak electric current out of popular use for several decades (Priori, 2003Priori A. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 114: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, the public’s strongly negative opinion of ECT contributed to the desertion of this technique despite its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of depression (Lauber et al., 2005Lauber C. Nordt C. Falcato L. Rössler W. Psychiatry Res. 2005; 134: 205-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Investigations into weak direct currents returned briefly in the 1960s but were once again abandoned with the rising use of psychopharmaceuticals to treat mental illness (Priori, 2003Priori A. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2003; 114: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Over the past several decades, neurostimulation techniques have gradually gained favor in the public eye. A surge of interest in invasive (e.g., deep brain stimulation [DBS]) and noninvasive forms of neurostimulation (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] and transcranial direct current stimulation [tDCS]) has propelled research that examines the therapeutic potential of these techniques. Currently, tDCS is primarily used as an investigative and therapeutic tool in the context of pain, neurorehabilitation after stroke, and depression (Stagg and Nitsche, 2011Stagg C.J. Nitsche M.A. Neuroscientist. 2011; 17: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). However, tDCS has garnered considerable attention due to its capacity to enhance neurological function (Hamilton et al., 2011Hamilton R. Messing S. Chatterjee A. Neurology. 2011; 76: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recently, the technique has caused excitement in the lay public and academia as a “portable, painless, inexpensive and safe” therapeutic and enhancement device (Cohen Kadosh et al., 2012Cohen Kadosh R. Levy N. O’Shea J. Shea N. Savulescu J. Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R108-R111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Yet, despite these claims, the safety and efficacy of tDCS have only been demonstrated in controlled laboratory settings and, without supervision, the use of tDCS for enhancement might cause serious adverse effects such as temporary respiratory paralysis (Brunoni et al., 2012Brunoni A.R. Nitsche M.A. Bolognini N. Bikson M. Wagner T. Merabet L. Edwards D.J. Valero-Cabre A. Rotenberg A. Pascual-Leone A. et al.Brain Stimulat. 2012; 5: 175-195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of tDCS are hard to predict. Media coverage of stimulation techniques is now often enthusiastic about the benefits these techniques could yield. For example, media discussions about DBS have been optimistic, with little explicit discussion concerning ethical issues, therapeutic limitations, or side effects that could result from the widespread use of DBS (Racine et al., 2007Racine E. Waldman S. Palmour N. Risse D. Illes J. Camb. Q. Healthc. Ethics. 2007; 16: 314-318Google Scholar). Given the nature of tDCS and the lack of oversight governing its use, academic and print media discourse could shape the public’s risk-benefit perceptions, impact the uptake of this technology, and, consequently, lead to negative implications for ethical and regulatory oversight. Indeed, such positive portrayals in the media have been shown to indirectly affect patient understanding and consent for DBS (Bell et al., 2010Bell E. Maxwell B. McAndrews M.P. Sadikot A. Racine E. J. Clin. Ethics. 2010; 21: 112-124PubMed Google Scholar). To better assess publically available information and discussions about tDCS, we analyzed academic and print media coverage of this technique. We performed academic literature searches on PubMed using the keywords “transcranial direct current stimulation” OR “transcranial electrical stimulation” OR “direct current brain polarization” and established the relevance of academic papers by analyzing the abstracts. Exclusion criteria included papers without an abstract in English or available full text, detailing techniques other than tDCS, reporting the use of tDCS during surgery or under anesthesia, and unpublished proofs (results: 1,237 retrieved articles; 948 relevant papers). One additional relevant paper that was repeatedly referred to in the literature but not captured in our searches was also included. We used a similar strategy to search the Factiva database for relevant print media articles (306 retrieved articles; 218 relevant articles). The print media analysis included English language articles that provide information about tDCS to the general public. Exclusion criteria included sources targeting medical professionals, irrelevant article types (e.g., obituaries), and duplicates. Additionally, 18 online-only articles were excluded. Articles were coded systematically by two independent coders. The coding structure included the identification of (1) the year of publication, (2) type of source (print media or academic), (3) type of tDCS application described (therapeutic, enhancement, technical, or investigative), and (4) overall tone (optimistic, critical, or neutral/balanced). For both academic and print media literature, therapeutic applications referred to the use of tDCS within a patient population to improve their condition, while technical descriptions referred to general information about the technique. Both the investigative and enhancement descriptions detailed the use of tDCS in healthy populations; enhancement reflects tDCS used specifically to improve some aspect of performance, while investigative refers to all other types of tDCS studies (e.g., on moral judgment). The amount of information on tDCS available to the public has increased dramatically in recent years in both academic literature and print media articles (Figure 1). Even though modern uses of tDCS have been reported in peer-reviewed academic literature since 1964, the earliest print media article on this topic we found was published in 2006. This publication date coincides with a substantial increase in volume of academic literature on tDCS and the appearance of several academic papers reporting the therapeutic and enhancement effects of tDCS. There was a considerable mismatch between the focus in academic and print media articles. The academic articles focused primarily on therapeutic uses of tDCS (n = 428; 45%), followed by investigative uses (n = 297; 31%). Enhancement use was the dominant topic in only 120 articles (13%) and was followed closely in number by technical aspects (n = 104; 11%). In print media articles, discussions surrounding potential enhancement uses of tDCS were the primary focus of 92 (42%), with an equal number (n = 92; 42%) focusing on therapeutic applications of tDCS. These were followed by descriptions of investigative uses (n = 23; 11%) and technical aspects (n = 11; 5%). The majority of print media headlines were enthusiastic and described tDCS as an “amazing new technique” and only highlighted the potential benefits of tDCS (Table 1). We encountered strong and potentially misleading statements about the real-world effects and applicability of tDCS (e.g., “schoolchildren who struggle to grasp mathematics could benefit from having their brains roused with electricity” [The Guardian, April 11, 2010]). In the entire sample of relevant articles, only eight (3.5%) advised caution or mentioned the possibility of adverse effects (Figure 2). The fact that the mechanisms of action of tDCS are unknown and that long-term changes could also include adverse effects were almost never mentioned.Table 1Illustrative Examples of Headlines in Print Media Reports on Therapeutic and Enhancement Use of tDCSTherapeutic ApplicationEnhancement Application“Mild jolt for beating blues” (Hobart Mercury, February 16, 2006)“Electrify your mind” (New Scientist, April 15, 2006)“Psychiatry’s shocking new tools” (IEEE Spectrum, March 1, 2006)“Little brain zap, big memory boost” (New Scientist, August 2010)“Brain stimulation improves memory in Alzheimer’s” (Reuters News, August 22, 2008)“A tiny zap to improve memory” (The Philadelphia Inquirer, October 23, 2010)“Therapies replace electroshock” (Montreal Gazette, October 9, 2010)“Zapping brain boosts math skills” (Investor’s Business Daily, November 8, 2010)“Tiny brain shocks may help schizophrenia patients” (The Conversation, July 28, 2011)“Got a problem – put your electrical thinking cap on” (Guardian Unlimited, February 2, 2011)“Electricity zap to brain aids stroke recovery” (Daily Mail, September 16, 2011)“A zap to brain to bring out the genius in you” (The Press Trust of India, February 3, 2011)“Getting a head start” (The Engineer, January 23, 2012)“Electric shock improves academic performance” (Indo-Asian News Service, January 26, 2012)“Brainwave is a breakthrough” (St George & Sutherland Shire Leader, March 6, 2012)“Zen and the art of genius” (New Scientist, February 4, 2012)“Electric zap stops migraines” (Investor’s Business Daily, May 2, 2012)“Jump-start your brain” (Boston Magazine, June 1, 2012)“Zap your way out of depression” (Timaru Herald, February 14, 2013)“Spark of Genius” (Sunday Tribune, April 7, 2013) Open table in a new tab Academic articles, while also enthusiastic, usually involved more balanced discussions. The academic literature also mentioned safety issues, the need for technical improvements, and potential adverse effects from the use of tDCS more frequently than in the print media, where these conversations were largely lacking. Print media articles sensationalized the capabilities of tDCS (e.g., “tDCS … could improve anything from focus and motor control to moral reasoning. It’s simple. It’s relatively cheap” [Sunday Tribune, July 4, 2013]). In the print media, findings about tDCS were also combined with misconceptions (e.g., “It is a known fact that humans only use 10% of their brain. … with the advancements in technology a person can boost this capacity. By attaching a 9 V battery to the scalp…” [TopNews, October 3, 2013]). Therefore, not only was the content reported by the two media types different, but the way in which they reported the information was as well. Given the rapid evolution of tDCS in the public domain and in academia, tackling its social, ethical, and policy implications requires a multifaceted response. We explore three areas of action. The enthusiastic depiction of neuroscientific and neurotechnological advances can generate deep public misunderstandings about the scientific and clinical aspects of these findings (e.g., Racine et al., 2007Racine E. Waldman S. Palmour N. Risse D. Illes J. Camb. Q. Healthc. Ethics. 2007; 16: 314-318Google Scholar, Racine et al., 2010Racine E. Waldman S. Rosenberg J. Illes J. Soc. Sci. Med. 2010; 71: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). By not measuring (and hence not reporting) the potential detrimental effects of tDCS, experiments reported in academic papers could also bolster the perception that tDCS induces cognitive enhancement. However, it is unclear if such an effect provokes collateral inhibition of other cognitive functions (Iuculano and Cohen Kadosh, 2013Iuculano T. Cohen Kadosh R. J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 4482-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The belief that the biological mechanism acting behind tDCS is a simple and accessible concept to the layperson, in addition to the long-standing history of using noninvasive current in therapeutic contexts, may increase the public’s enthusiasm for and comfort in using this device for enhancement. This, in turn, could lead to a swell in public interest and to the broad use of the technique. To curtail misunderstandings about tDCS, professional societies and researchers, perhaps in collaboration with academic publishers, could help the public understand the mechanisms, limitations, and genuine therapeutic potential of tDCS. Governmental agencies, such as the NIH, could issue health warnings about tDCS to increase the public’s scientific literacy. This information could clarify the mechanism of action of tDCS and potential safety concerns in layman’s terms as well as clearly outline the current state of research. Beyond its usefulness for the public, clinicians, and others, this information would serve as a reference to media outlets wishing to discuss tDCS knowledgeably. Additionally, researchers, journalists, and other members of the media who frequently write about scientific topics could receive training concerning how to translate neuroscientific information to the public. The wide availability of tDCS is a significant issue (Fitz and Reiner, 2013Fitz N.S. Reiner P.B. J. Med. Ethics. 2013; (Published online June 13, 2013)https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2013-101458Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, Bikson et al., 2013Bikson M. Bestmann S. Edwards D.

While some companies have imposed self-restraint on the sale of this technology (Table 2), such self-regulation does not resolve the issue. Even if tDCS devices as products were only sold to physicians, a secondary market for tDCS as a therapeutic and enhancement service seems to be on the rise, making the issue of training requirements salient. The most concerning aspect is the virtually omnipresent availability of tDCS as a simple do-it-yourself gadget: several websites offer detailed instructions on how to build a tDCS device and where to place electrodes to achieve enhancement (Table 2).Table 2Examples of the International Availability of tDCSCountryWebpageAdvertised ApplicationTargeted MarketDisclaimer/Restrictions in AccesstDCS as a ProductGermanyhttp://www.neuroconn.de/dc-stimulator_mc_en/InvestigativeResearchersNo training requiredHong Konghttp://www.trans-cranial.com/Therapy, enhancementUnspecified individual usersNo training required; world-wide shippingUnited Stateshttp://tdcsdevicekit.com/index.php/wholesale-distributorsTherapy, enhancementWholesale distributors, unspecified individual usersNo training requiredCanadahttp://www.mindalive.com/Products_OASIS_Pro.htmTherapy, enhancementPhysiciansPhysicians onlyUnited Kingdom and United Stateshttp://www.foc.us/Enhancement (neurogaming)Unspecified individual usersNo training required; “The foc.us [device] … is not a medical device, and is not regulated by the FDA;” “The headset is not a toy, is not recommended for under 18s, epilepsy sufferers or people with implants.”tDCS as a ServiceUnited Stateshttp://www.transcranialbrainstimulation.com/TherapyPsychiatric and neurological conditionsNo disclaimers or restrictionsUnited Kingdomhttp://www.york-biofeedback.co.uk/neurofeedback/tdcs.aspxTherapy, enhancementDecrease in symptoms, increase in cognitionNot used on minorsCanadahttp://www.drmueller-healthpsychology.com/tDCS.htmlTherapyDepression and chronic painNo disclaimers or restrictionstDCS as a Do-It-Yourself DevicePresentation Form–http://speakwisdom.wordpress.com/2012/12/09/can-a-simple-safe-tdcs-device-be-built-from-radio-shack-components/Therapy, enhancement, investigative “tDCS … Swiss Army knife of 21st Century”Step-by-step tutorial–http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgFWEBwT6BETherapy, enhancement, investigativeStep-by-step tutorial–http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Y3cpB26IYTherapy, enhancement, investigativeCommercial presentation quoting scientific studiesNote: the list found in this table is representative, not exhaustive.

The regulation of medical devices is a complex area where discrepancies between European, North American, and Asian markets create significant challenges by impacting the dissemination and use of these devices internationally. Currently, the regulatory regimes have important blind spots: devices may be designated as “safe” without any review of claims about their effectiveness. Furthermore, manipulating claims about effectiveness might lead to admission of devices by regulatory default (Guleyupoglu et al., 2013Guleyupoglu B. Schestatsky P. Edwards D. Fregni F. Bikson M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2013; 219: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The European Union “CE” (i.e., conformité européenne) mark can be obtained by mere compliance with production standards as long as no medical claims are made in the application. In the U.S., medical claims regarding a device that is “substantially equivalent” to a formerly “cleared” device allow this similar device to be marketed (Food and Drug Administration, 2014Food and Drug Administration (2014). Device Approvals, Denials and Clearances. Medical Devices, http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/deviceapprovalsandclearances/default.htm.Google Scholar). Therefore, producers that claim that tDCS has medical uses are able to do so because similar devices that generate weak electrical currents have been used effectively for rehabilitation of muscle injuries. Postmarket surveillance is another crucial aspect that falters in its current shape and form even for invasive implantable devices (e.g., DBS). There is currently no consensus on tDCS regulation, though several leading authors have proposed ways to manage devices with enhancement effects by accommodating them within the current regulations for medical devices (Maslen et al., 2014Maslen H. Douglas T. Cohen Kadosh R. Levy N. Savulescu J. JLB. 2014; 1: 68-93Google Scholar). Most proposals posit that solutions should include the monitoring of adverse events stemming from tDCS in addition to paying closer attention to marketing and manufacturing standards. Simple policy actions could be to make mandatory disclaimers about the current evidence supporting tDCS. Training and licensing procedures should also be considered (Dubljević, 2012Dubljević V. Am. J. Bioethics Neurosci. 2012; 3: 29-33Google Scholar). At this time, raising clinicians’ awareness about tDCS as an emerging and largely unregulated device is warranted. Previous clinical responses to other forms of unproven therapies are pillars to build from. In such cases, clinicians must balance the potential benefits of the device with their unknown risks, as well as other implications for users such as the exclusion from prospective clinical trials, financial costs, and clinical follow-up. Clarifying the role of clinicians with respect to enhancement uses of tDCS brings another level of complexity given that such uses raise distinct ethical and social issues that are not well covered by current clinical practice guidelines. The American Academy of Neurology has proposed that physicians have leeway in accepting or declining requests for cognitive enhancement drugs based on their expertise (Larriviere et al., 2009Larriviere D. Williams M.A. Rizzo M. Bonnie R.J. AAN Ethics, Law and Humanities CommitteeNeurology. 2009; 73: 1406-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Although it is encouraging to see a professional society address this issue, this proposal neither provides clear guidance to physicians about what they should do nor is it directly applicable to the distinct issues raised by cognitive enhancement devices. The use of tDCS in pediatric populations also amplifies the ethical challenges of crafting responsible clinical practice due to the uncertainty of its long-term effects on developing brains. This could call for more protective approaches (as suggested in the context of pediatric use of enhancement drugs, see Graf et al., 2013Graf W.D. Nagel S.K. Epstein L.G. Miller G. Nass R. Larriviere D. Neurology. 2013; 80: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Physicians and other clinicians have—up until now—not been actively engaged in tackling ethical, clinical, and policy aspects of tDCS. However, their crucial role in the public eye as knowledgeable and informed advisors for medical decision making calls for their involvement in the clinical aspects of policy responses to tDCS. In conclusion, the media have enthusiastically reported that tDCS could be used to enhance cognitive function. The current regulatory gap means that tDCS is readily available as a service, product, or even a homemade device, in many countries without any guidance being provided by policy makers. A response to the policy and regulatory aspects of tDCS is urgently needed."

Here, using fast 3D two-photon imaging and a caged glutamate, we challenge this classical view by demonstrating that FS-PV IN dendrites can generate propagating Ca2+ spikes during sharp-wave ripples. The spikes originate from dendritic hot spots and are mediated dominantly by L-type Ca2+ channels. Notably, Ca2+ spikes were associated with intrinsically generated membrane potential oscillations. These oscillations required the activation of voltage-gated Na+ channels, had the same frequency as the field potential oscillations associated with sharp-wave ripples, and controlled the phase of action potentials. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the smallest functional unit that can generate ripple-frequency oscillations is a segment of a dendrite."

Parkinson patients were tested after overnight withdrawal of anti-Parkinsonian medication.University Medical Center Groningen, tertiary care, the Netherlands.Patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 10; mean age 69.0 years; 6 male) and healthy controls (n = 10; mean age 68.1 years; 6 male).Not applicable.Movement time and velocity to detect bradykinesia and the size of writing to detect micrographia. A rest recording to investigate the presence of a rest-tremor, by frequency analysis.Mean disease duration in the Parkinson group was 4.4 years and the patients were in modified Hoehn-Yahr stages 1-2.5. In general, Parkinson patients were slower than healthy control participants. Median time per repetition, median velocity and median acceleration of the sentence task and median velocity of the elel task differed significantly between Parkinson patients and healthy control participants (all p<0.0014). Parkinson patients also wrote smaller than healthy control participants and the width of the 'e' in the elel task was significantly smaller in Parkinson patients compared to healthy control participants (p<0.0014). A rest-tremor was detected in the three patients who were clinically assessed as having rest-tremor.This study shows that standardized handwriting can provide objective measures for bradykinesia, tremor and micrographia to distinguish Parkinson patients from healthy control participants."
https://openalex.org/W2086542332,"NAFLD is the most common liver disease worldwide but it is the potential evolution to NASH and eventually to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), even in the absence of cirrhosis, that makes NAFLD of such clinical importance.we aimed to create a mouse model reproducing the pathological spectrum of NAFLD and to investigate the role of possible co-factors in promoting HCC.mice were treated with a choline-deficient L-amino-acid-defined-diet (CDAA) or its control (CSAA diet) and subjected to a low-dose i.p. injection of CCl4 or vehicle. Insulin resistance was measured by the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp method. Steatosis, fibrosis and HCC were evaluated by histological and molecular analysis.CDAA-treated mice showed peripheral insulin resistance at 1 month. At 1-3 months, extensive steatosis and fibrosis were observed in CDAA and CDAA+CCl4 groups. At 6 months, equal increase in steatosis and fibrosis was observed between the two groups, together with the appearance of tumor. At 9 months of treatment, the 100% of CDAA+CCl4 treated mice revealed tumor versus 40% of CDAA mice. Insulin-like Growth Factor-2 (IGF-2) and Osteopontin (SPP-1) were increased in CDAA mice versus CSAA. Furthermore, Immunostaining for p-AKT, p-c-Myc and Glypican-3 revealed increased positivity in the tumors.the CDAA model promotes the development of HCC from NAFLD-NASH in the presence of insulin resistance but in the absence of cirrhosis. Since this condition is increasingly recognized in humans, our study provides a model that may help understanding mechanisms of carcinogenesis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2093694360,"Ionizing radiation is responsible for oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which alters the cellular redox potential. This change activates several redox sensitive enzymes which are crucial in activating signaling pathways at molecular level and can lead to oxidative stress induced inflammation. Therefore, the present study was intended to assess the anti-inflammatory role of ferulic acid (FA), a plant flavonoid, against radiation-induced oxidative stress with a novel mechanistic viewpoint. FA was administered (50 mg/kg body wt) to Swiss albino mice for five consecutive days prior to exposing them to a single dose of 10 Gy 60Co γ-irradiation. The dose of FA was optimized from the survival experiment and 50 mg/kg body wt dose showed optimum effect. FA significantly ameliorated the radiation induced inflammatory response such as phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα and consequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). FA also prevented the increase of cycloxygenase-2 (Cox-2) protein, inducible nitric oxide synthase-2 (iNOS-2) gene expression, lipid peroxidation in liver and the increase of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum. It was observed that exposure to radiation results in decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the pool of reduced glutathione (GSH) content. However, FA treatment prior to irradiation increased the activities of the same endogenous antioxidants. Thus, pretreatment with FA offers protection against gamma radiation induced inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W1999893555,"Synapses are particularly prone to dynamic alterations and thus play a major role in neuronal plasticity. Dynamic excitatory synapses are located at the membranous neuronal protrusions called dendritic spines. The ability to change synaptic connections involves both alterations at the morphological level and changes in postsynaptic receptor composition. We report that endogenous matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity promotes the structural and functional plasticity of local synapses by its effect on glutamate receptor mobility and content. We used live imaging of cultured hippocampal neurons and quantitative morphological analysis to show that chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) induces the permanent enlargement of a subset of small dendritic spines in an MMP-dependent manner. We also used a superresolution microscopy approach and found that spine expansion induced by cLTP was accompanied by MMP-dependent immobilization and synaptic accumulation as well as the clustering of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors. Altogether, our results reveal novel molecular and cellular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1983545974,"Objective Growing evidences indicate that the histone methyltransferase EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2) may be an appropriate therapeutic target in some tumors. Indeed, a high expression of EZH2 is correlated with poor prognosis and metastasis in many cancers. In addition, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an S-adenosyl-L homocysteine hydrolase inhibitor which induces EZH2 protein depletion, leads to cell death in several cancers and tumors. The aim of this study was to determine whether an epigenetic therapy targeting EZH2 with DZNep may be also efficient to treat chondrosarcomas. Methods EZH2 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and western-blot. Chondrosarcoma cell line CH2879 was cultured in the presence of DZNep, and its growth and survival were evaluated by counting adherent cells periodically. Apoptosis was assayed by cell cycle analysis, Apo2.7 expression using flow cytometry, and by PARP cleavage using western-blot. Cell migration was assessed by wound healing assay. Results Chondrosarcomas (at least with high grade) highly express EZH2, at contrary to enchondromas or chondrocytes. In vitro, DZNep inhibits EZH2 protein expression, and subsequently reduces the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). Interestingly, DZNep induces cell death of chondrosarcoma cell lines by apoptosis, while it slightly reduces growth of normal chondrocytes. In addition, DZNep reduces cell migration. Conclusion These results indicate that an epigenetic therapy that pharmacologically targets EZH2 via DZNep may constitute a novel approach to treat chondrosarcomas."

However, it is currently unknown which lipid kinases generate PIP2 in nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and if these kinases regulate pronociceptive receptor signaling. Here, we found that phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5 kinase type 1C (PIP5K1C) is expressed at higher levels than any other PIP5K and, based on experiments with Pip5k1c+/− mice, generates at least half of all PIP2 in DRG neurons.

We identified a small molecule inhibitor of PIP5K1C (UNC3230) in a high-throughput screen. UNC3230 lowered PIP2 levels in DRG neurons and attenuated hypersensitivity when administered intrathecally or into the hindpaw.

Our studies reveal that PIP5K1C regulates PIP2-dependent nociceptive signaling and suggest that PIP5K1C is a therapeutic target for chronic pain. Tissue inflammation and nerve injury cause the release of a complex mix of chemicals that sensitize nociceptive dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and contribute to chronic pain (Basbaum et al., 2009Basbaum A.I. Bautista D.M. Scherrer G. Julius D. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of pain.Cell. 2009; 139: 267-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). These chemicals activate molecularly diverse pronociceptive receptors found on DRG neurons and their axon terminals. While these receptors represent attractive targets for analgesic drug development, efforts to block individual pronociceptive receptors have not yet produced effective treatments for chronic pain (Gold and Gebhart, 2010Gold M.S. Gebhart G.F. Nociceptor sensitization in pain pathogenesis.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). This lack of efficacy could reflect the fact that multiple pronociceptive receptors are activated in the setting of chronic pain. One approach to treat pain that bypasses this receptor diversity is to target points where different signaling pathways converge. Indeed, drugs that block signaling proteins that are several steps downstream from receptor activation, including protein kinase Cε (PKCε) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), reduce nociceptive neuron sensitization, thermal hyperalgesia, and mechanical allodynia in animal models (Aley et al., 2000Aley K.O.

However, drugs that inhibit PKCε or MAPKs have shown modest-to-no efficacy in treating different pain conditions in humans (Anand et al., 2011Anand P. Shenoy R. Palmer J.E. Baines A.J. Lai R.Y.

This limited efficacy does not mean that PKCε or MAPK inhibitors cannot be used to treat pain, as drugs can show limited-to-no efficacy for a number of reasons, including the drugs may not engage their molecular target in humans or the drugs may lack efficacy in some pain conditions but not others. Another convergence point, albeit one that has not been fully explored in the context of treating pain, is immediately downstream of multiple pronociceptive receptors. Many pronociceptive receptors, including Gq-coupled receptors, Gs-coupled receptors (via EPAC), and receptor tyrosine kinases, initiate signaling upon phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated hydrolysis of the lipid second messenger PIP2 (Hucho et al., 2005Hucho T.B. Dina O.A. Levine J.D. Epac mediates a cAMP-to-PKC signaling in inflammatory pain: an isolectin B4(+) neuron-specific mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6119-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PIP2 hydrolysis produces diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which regulate nociceptive sensitization via multiple pathways, including PKC-dependent modulation of ion channels like TRPV1, MAPK activation, and IP3-mediated calcium influx (Falkenburger et al., 2010Falkenburger B.H.

Nagy G. et al.Gα(q/11) signaling tonically modulates nociceptor function and contributes to activity-dependent sensitization.Pain. 2012; 153: 184-196PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PIP2 thus sits at a convergence point for diverse receptors and signaling pathways that promote and maintain nociceptive sensitization. In light of this information, we reasoned that it might be possible to reduce signaling through pronociceptive receptors and reduce pain sensitization by inhibiting the lipid kinase that generates the majority of all PIP2 in DRG neurons. Type 1 phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (Pip5k1s) generate PIP2 by phosphorylating the 5 position on the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate [PI(4)P]. There are three mammalian Pip5k1 genes (Pip5k1a, Pip5k1b, and Pip5k1c) (Ishihara et al., 1998Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Of these, Pip5k1c (also known as Pip5k1γ) is highly expressed in the brain (Wenk et al., 2001Wenk M.R. Pellegrini L.

The only phenotype observed thus far in Pip5k1c+/− mice is high-frequency (>20 kHz) hearing loss (Rodriguez et al., 2012Rodriguez L. Simeonato E. Scimemi P. Anselmi F. Calì B. Crispino G.

When we initiated our studies, it was unknown which enzymes generated PIP2 in nociceptive DRG neurons or if these enzymes regulated nociception. Here, we report that PIP5K1C is expressed in nearly all DRG neurons, generates at least half of all PIP2 in the DRG, and regulates nociceptive sensitization in response to diverse stimuli that cause pain. Our studies validate PIP5K1C as an analgesic drug target and identify a PIP5K1C inhibitor that attenuates pain in animal models. To determine which Pip5k1s were expressed in the DRG, we performed in situ hybridization with probes for the three known mammalian Pip5k1 genes. We found that Pip5k1c was expressed at higher levels in adult mouse DRG than the two other Pip5k1 genes and was expressed in nearly all DRG neurons (Figures 1A–1C ). PIP5K1C is also present in the brain at higher levels than PIP5K1A and PIP5K1B (Akiba et al., 2002Akiba Y. Suzuki R. Saito-Saino S. Owada Y. Sakagami H. Watanabe M. Kondo H.

Consistent with widespread expression in all DRG neurons, based on in situ hybridization, Pip5k1c was expressed in virtually all peptidergic (96.7%; n = 220 counted) and nonpeptidergic (96.1%; n = 210 counted) nociceptive neurons, marked by Calcitonin gene-related peptide-alpha (Cgrp) and Prostatic acid phosphatase (Pap), respectively (Figures 1D and 1E) (McCoy et al., 2013McCoy E.S.

Using a recently developed antibody (Hara et al., 2013Hara Y. Fukaya M. Tamaki H. Sakagami H. Type I phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase γ is required for neuronal migration in the mouse developing cerebral cortex.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2013; 38: 2659-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we found that PIP5K1C was present on the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm of most DRG neurons (Figures S1A–S1C available online). PIP5K1C was highly colocalized with PAP (98.1%; n = 2,672 counted), CGRP (97.5%; n = 2,094 counted), and TRPV1 (92.2%; n = 1,915 counted), markers of nociceptive neurons (Figures S1D–S1L). Moreover, PIP5K1C was expressed in human DRG at levels comparable to CGRP (intensity values of 311 and 346, respectively, from Affymetrix GeneChip experiments). We then quantified PIP5K1C protein and PIP2 levels in the DRG of wild-type (WT; Pip5k1c+/+), Pip5k1c+/−, and Pip5k1c−/− embryonic (E17.5–E18.5) mice. We found that PIP5K1C protein and PIP2 levels were reduced (by ∼50%) in the DRG of Pip5k1c+/− embryonic mice (Figures 1F–1H). No PIP5K1C protein was detectable in DRG from Pip5k1c−/− embryonic mice, confirming complete gene knockout and that both antibodies used in our study specifically recognized PIP5K1C (Figures 1F and 1G). In addition, PIP2 was reduced by ∼70% in DRG from Pip5k1c−/− embryonic mice (Figure 1H). Unlike Pip5k1c−/− mice that die at birth, Pip5k1c+/− mice live into adulthood and reproduce normally (Di Paolo et al., 2004Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P. Impaired PtdIns(4,5)P2 synthesis in nerve terminals produces defects in synaptic vesicle trafficking.Nature. 2004; 431: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Therefore, we quantified PIP5K1C protein and PIP2 levels in the DRG from Pip5k1c+/− adult mice and WT littermate controls. PIP5K1C protein was reduced by ∼40% and PIP2 levels were reduced by ∼50% in the DRG of Pip5k1c+/− mice (Figures 1I and 1K). In contrast, PIP2 was not reduced in spinal cord or brain from adult Pip5k1c+/− mice (Figure 1K). Likewise, using a different quantification method, PIP2 was not reduced in the brain of embryonic Pip5k1c+/− mice (Di Paolo et al., 2004Di Paolo G. Moskowitz H.S. Gipson K. Wenk M.R. Voronov S. Obayashi M. Flavell R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Ryan T.A. De Camilli P.

Chem. 2010; 285: 28708-28714Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, we used immunofluorescence staining to examine PIP2 levels at the membrane of cultured DRG neurons taken from adult mice. Quantification of the average perimeter (membrane) staining intensity in confocal images revealed that membrane PIP2 levels were reduced by ∼50% in small-to-medium diameter (≤27 μm) neurons of Pip5k1c+/− mice compared to WT controls (Figures 1L and 1M). Taken together, our data indicate that PIP5K1C generates at least half of all PIP2 in the DRG, including in small-to-medium diameter, presumably nociceptive, DRG neurons. Moreover, our data indicate that PIP2 is reduced in DRG of Pip5k1c+/− adult mice, but is not reduced in other regions of the nervous system that process pain and somatosensory stimuli, namely spinal cord and brain. Diverse molecules cause pain by activating pronociceptive G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in DRG neurons. Because PIP2 levels in the membrane were reduced by ∼50% in DRG neurons, we hypothesized that pronociceptive GPCRs that couple to phospholipases and PIP2 hydrolysis would signal less effectively in Pip5k1c+/− mice. To test this hypothesis we used the ratiometric calcium (Ca2+) indicator dye Fura-2-AM to quantify lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and 17-phenyl trinor prostaglandin E2 (17-PT PGE2) evoked calcium responses in small-to-medium diameter DRG neurons. LPA evokes Ca2+ influx in small-to-medium diameter DRG neurons and, when injected intrathecally (i.t.), produces a chemically-induced form of neuropathic pain that is dependent on LPA1 receptor activation (Elmes et al., 2004Elmes S.J.

Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Following stimulation with LPA or 17-PT PGE2, calcium responses (quantified as area under the curve [AUC]) were blunted in Pip5k1c+/− neurons compared to WT controls (Figures 2A–2D ). Importantly, these signaling deficits could be restored to WT levels by delivering excess PIP2 to Pip5k1c+/− neurons just prior to imaging (Figures 2A–2D). These data suggest that the signaling deficits observed in Pip5k1c+/− neurons were the result of reduced PIP2 levels and were not due to poor cell health or PIP2-independent signaling deficits. Moreover, KCl-evoked Ca2+ responses, which reflect activation of voltage-gated calcium channels, were not altered (Figure 2A, data not shown). The percentage of neurons responding to either ligand (LPA responders: mean 22.2% ± 2.9% for WT and 24.1% ± 3.7% for Pip5k1c+/−; 17-PT PGE2 responders: 6.0% ± 1.2% for WT and 4.7% ± 1.1% for Pip5k1c+/−) and the average diameter of responding neurons was not significantly different between WT and Pip5k1c+/− cultures (data not shown). We also found that delivering excess PIP2 to WT neurons did not elevate LPA- or 17-PT PGE2-evoked calcium responses beyond control levels, suggesting that PIP2 levels are already saturated in WT neurons under our culture conditions. Collectively, our data reveal that PIP5K1C regulates signaling downstream from two pronociceptive receptors, one associated with neuropathic pain and the other with inflammatory pain. Moreover, rescue experiments revealed that Pip5k1c regulates calcium signaling in DRG neurons via a PIP2-dependent mechanism, placing PIP5K1C upstream of multiple signaling pathways implicated in pain sensitization (Figure 2E). LPA and 17-PT PGE2 induce GPCR-mediated nociceptive responses when injected into the hindpaw (Kassuya et al., 2007Kassuya C.A. Ferreira J. Claudino R.F. Calixto J.B.

To determine if these compounds signal less effectively in Pip5k1c+/− mice, we injected LPA (4.1 μg) or 17-PT PGE2 (1.2 μg) into one hindpaw then monitored the duration of licking for 5 min. We found that Pip5k1c+/− mice spent less time licking their ligand-injected hindpaws when compared to WT littermates (Figure 2F). Reduced licking was not due to motor impairment, as there were no significant differences between WT and Pip5k1c+/− mice in the rotarod assay and gait was not impaired (stride or stance; Figures S2A–S2C). Moreover, acute responses to innocuous mechanical touch were not impaired in Pip5k1c+/− mice (Figure S2D). There was also no loss of nociceptive neurons or terminals in spinal cord of Pip5k1c+/− mice (determined by immunostaining for CGRP and IB4-binding, markers of nociceptive neurons; Figures S3A–S3J). Excitatory synaptic transmission between sensory neurons and spinal dorsal horn neurons was not impaired in Pip5k1c+/− mice, assessed by measuring excitatory field potential (fEPSP) amplitude in spinal cord slices after stimulating the dorsal root with a suction electrode (Street et al., 2011Street S.E.

Specifically, we found no significant differences between genotypes in fEPSP amplitude at different stimulus strengths (Figure S3K), following synaptic depletion (Figures S3L and S3M) or during synaptic recovery (Figure S3N). These data also ruled out the possibility that synaptic transmission or synaptic vesicle trafficking was impaired in Pip5k1c+/− mice. Instead, our data suggest that reduced n"

However, the structure and relevance of sensory signals depend on behavioral state. Here, we show that behavior modifies neural activity at the earliest stages of fly vision. We describe a class of wide-field neurons that provide feedback to the most peripheral layer of the Drosophila visual system, the lamina. Using in vivo patch-clamp electrophysiology, we found that lamina wide-field neurons respond to low-frequency luminance fluctuations. Recordings in flying flies revealed that the gain and frequency tuning of wide-field neurons change during flight, and that these effects are mimicked by the neuromodulator octopamine. Genetically silencing wide-field neurons increased behavioral responses to slow-motion stimuli. Together, these findings identify a cell type that is gated by behavior to enhance neural coding by subtracting low-frequency signals from the inputs to motion detection circuits."

Colibactin-producing Escherichia coli have been demonstrated to induce host DNA damage and promote colorectal cancer (CRC) development. In Taiwan, the occurrence of pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) has been suggested to correlate with an increasing risk of CRC, and Klebsiella pneumoniae is the predominant PLA pathogen in Taiwan.At the asn tRNA loci of the newly sequenced K. pneumoniae 1084 genome, we identified a 208-kb genomic island, KPHPI208, of which a module identical to the E. coli pks colibactin gene cluster was recognized. KPHPI208 consists of eight modules, including the colibactin module and the modules predicted to be involved in integration, conjugation, yersiniabactin production, microcin production, and unknown functions. Transient infection of BALB/c normal liver cells with K. pneumoniae 1084 increased the phosphorylation of histone H2AX, indicating the induction of host DNA damage. Colibactin was required for the genotoxicity of K. pneumoniae 1084, as it was diminished by deletion of clbA gene and restored to the wild type level by trans-complementation with a clbA coding plasmid. Besides, BALB/c mice infected with K. pneumoniae 1084 exhibited enhanced DNA damage in the liver parenchymal cells when compared to the isogenic clbA deletion mutant. By PCR detection, the prevalence of pks-positive K. pneumoniae in Taiwan is 25.6%, which is higher than that reported in Europe (3.5%), and is significantly correlated with K1 type, which predominantly accounted for PLA in Taiwan.Our knowledge regarding how bacteria contribute to carcinogenesis has just begun. The identification of genotoxic K. pneumoniae and its genetic components will facilitate future studies to elucidate the molecular basis underlying the link between K. pneumoniae, PLA, and CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2049885866,"Purpose To evaluate the use of 3D optical surface imaging as a surrogate for respiratory gated deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) for left breast irradiation. Material and Methods Patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with lumpectomy or mastectomy were selected as candidates for DIBH treatment for their external beam radiation therapy. Treatment plans were created on both free breathing (FB) and DIBH computed tomography (CT) simulation scans to determine dosimetric benefits from DIBH. The Real-time Position Management (RPM) system was used to acquire patient's breathing trace during DIBH CT acquisition and treatment delivery. The reference 3D surface models from FB and DIBH CT scans were generated and transferred to the “AlignRT” system for patient positioning and real-time treatment monitoring. MV Cine images were acquired during treatment for each beam as quality assurance for intra-fractional position verification. The chest wall excursions measured on these images were used to define the actual target position during treatment, and to investigate the accuracy and reproducibility of RPM and AlignRT. Results Reduction in heart dose can be achieved using DIBH for left breast/chest wall radiation. RPM was shown to have inferior correlation with the actual target position, as determined by the MV Cine imaging. Therefore, RPM alone may not be an adequate surrogate in defining the breath-hold level. Alternatively, the AlignRT surface imaging demonstrated a superior correlation with the actual target positioning during DIBH. Both the vertical and magnitude real-time deltas (RTDs) reported by AlignRT can be used as the gating parameter, with a recommended threshold of ±3 mm and 5 mm, respectively. Conclusion The RPM system alone may not be sufficient for the required level of accuracy in left-sided breast/CW DIBH treatments. The 3D surface imaging can be used to ensure patient setup and monitor inter- and intra- fractional motions. Furthermore, the target position accuracy during DIBH treatment can be improved by AlignRT as a superior surrogate, in addition to the RPM system."

Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain is primarily driven by postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Activated upon glutamate release from presynaptic boutons, AMPARs provide the transient excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) required for propagation of the electrical signal (Raman and Trussell, 1992Raman I.M.

Native AMPARs in the mammalian brain are macromolecular complexes of considerable diversity assembled from a pool of more than 30 different protein constituents (Schwenk et al., 2012Schwenk J.

In heterologous expression experiments, both TARPs and CNIHs impact the gating of the AMPARs, either alone or in combination, by distinctly slowing deactivation and desensitization of various GluA homo- or hetero-tetramers (Schwenk et al., 2009Schwenk J.

Among the auxiliary core subunits, the two CNIH proteins exert the strongest influence, slowing the time constants of either channel closing process by up to more than 5-fold, independent of the GluA composition of the pore (Coombs et al., 2012Coombs I.D.

USA. 2010; 107: 16315-16319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the profound effects on AMPAR gating in heterologous systems, the significance of the CNIH proteins for EPSCs and synaptic transmission has remained unclear. Recent work using genetic deletion of the CNIHs reported accelerated miniature EPSCs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells as a result of an altered GluA subunit composition of synaptic AMPARs promoted by exclusive interaction of CNIHs with GluA1 (Herring et al., 2013Herring B.E. Shi Y. Suh Y.H. Zheng C.Y. Blankenship S.M. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Cornichon proteins determine the subunit composition of synaptic AMPA receptors.Neuron. 2013; 77: 1083-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Such selectivity in CNIH-GluA association, however, is in strict contrast to proteomic and biochemical analyses demonstrating equally robust assembly of the CNIH proteins into AMPARs in the absence of GluA1 or GluA2 proteins (Schwenk et al., 2012Schwenk J. Harmel N. Brechet A. Zolles G. Berkefeld H. Müller C.S. Bildl W. Baehrens D. Hüber B.

For investigating the relevance of CNIHs in excitatory synaptic transmission, we, therefore, turned to two types of neurons for which spontaneous EPSCs with markedly different time courses have been reported: mossy cells and aspiny interneurons in the hilar region of the rat hippocampus (Livsey and Vicini, 1992Livsey C.T. Vicini S. Slower spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in spiny versus aspiny hilar neurons.Neuron. 1992; 8: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the role of CNIHs in synaptic transmission using paired recordings between presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic target cells together with knockdown of protein expression by virally delivered shRNA. We show that CNIH2 profoundly impacts the timing of synaptic transmission in hippocampal hilar mossy cells and identify CNIH2 as the molecular distinction between slow and fast EPSC phenotypes. To measure the time course of synaptic transmission, we used paired recordings between presynaptic mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) and postsynaptic mossy cells or aspiny interneurons (Experimental Procedures). The MFBs, large presynaptic terminals of the dentate gyrus granule cells, are amenable to patch-clamp recordings (Bischofberger et al., 2006Bischofberger J. Engel D. Li L. Geiger J.R. Jonas P.

Red lines are linear fits to the data points with y values of 13.2 ms (left) and 5.8 ms (right). Figure 1 illustrates paired recordings in MFB-mossy cell and MFB-interneuron synapses. Single presynaptic APs elicited by brief current pulses evoked robust EPSCs in either type of postsynaptic neuron demonstrating functional connectivity in both synapses (Figure 1A). The EPSCs, recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV, exhibited comparable amplitudes in both synapses (mean values of ∼300 pA and ∼200 pA obtained in 50 mossy cells and 22 interneurons, respectively) and were entirely mediated by AMPARs as revealed by their complete block by 10 μM CNQX (data not shown). The time courses of the EPSCs obtained from MFB-mossy cell and MFB-interneuron synapses, however, were quite distinct, displaying obvious differences in onset and decay kinetics (Figure 1B). Most prominently, the decay phase of the mossy cell EPSCs was prolonged over that in interneurons. Mono-exponential fits to the current decay recorded in 50 MFB-mossy cell and 22 MFB-interneuron synapses yielded mean values (±SD) for the decay time constant (τ EPSC decay) of 11.8 ± 2.4 ms and 5.1 ± 0.9 ms, respectively (Figure 1C). Noteworthy, the values determined for τ EPSC decay in either type of postsynaptic neuron revealed considerable variation among cells and/or synapses (values of 8.1 to 17.7 ms and of 3.1 to 6.3 ms in mossy cells and interneurons, respectively), while the EPSCs recorded in any individual synapse were rather invariable (SD values <1 ms; Figure 1C). These recordings were complemented by immunocytochemistry on hippocampal slices stained with DAPI and a CNIH2-specific antibody (anti-CNIH2, Experimental Procedures). As shown in Figure 1D, CNIH2 immunoreactivity was detected in soma and dendrites of a subset of large hilar neurons (open arrowheads), presumably mossy cells, while neighboring neurons were not stained (filled arrowheads). Together, these results prompted the hypothesis that the slow EPSC decay in mossy cells results from slow deactivation/desensitization processes exerted by assembly of CNIH2 into the core of synaptic AMPARs. To test this hypothesis, we examined the significance of CNIH2 for the gating of synaptic AMPARs and the EPSC time course by means of knocking down its expression through lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA (sh-CNIH2). CNIH2 was targeted because, in the hippocampus, the amount of CNIH2 protein exceeds that of CNIH3 by at least an order of magnitude (data not shown). When tested on hippocampal cultures, quantification of protein amounts by western blotting and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) (Bildl et al., 2012Bildl W. Haupt A. Muller C.S. Biniossek M.L.

Moreover, protein knockdown was highly specific, as neither unrelated proteins nor the protein amounts of other AMPAR core constituents, most notably the GluA1-4 proteins, TARP γ-8, or CNIH3, were affected by sh-CNIH2 (Figure S2). The sh-CNIH2 lentivirus, which also expresses GFP, was stereotactically delivered by transcranial injection into the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampi (at P6/P7) that were used for subsequent slice experiments 10 to 18 days later. As visualized by the GFP marker, the virus transduced both mossy cells and interneurons in the hilus (Figure 2A, lower panel), and the GFP expression was used to guide slice recordings. In a first set of experiments, we used the whole-cell configuration on hilar mossy cells to record single EPSCs (Figure 2B, upper panel; Figure 3A) evoked by the frequent spontaneous APs occurring in the numerous synapses contacting these cells (Buckmaster et al., 1996Buckmaster P.S. Wenzel H.J. Kunkel D.D. Schwartzkroin P.A. Axon arbors and synaptic connections of hippocampal mossy cells in the rat in vivo.J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 366: 271-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Figure 2B (lower panel) illustrates results from two representative mossy cells that reflect the clear differences between neurons transduced with sh-CNIH2 and the control. First, the values for τ EPSC decay obtained in the uninfected mossy cell extended over a broad range, between 5 ms and 30 ms with a mean value (±SD) of 12.8 ± 4.1 ms (n = 1,319 EPSCs; Figure 2B, left panel). In contrast, in the transduced neuron where knockdown of the CNIH2 protein was virtually complete as verified by postrecording confocal microscopy using GFP fluorescence, biocytin-labeling, and anti-CNIH2 staining (Figure 2A, lower panel; Figure S3), both the range and the absolute values of τ EPSC decay were markedly altered. The mean τ EPSC decay decreased to 5.5 ms (±1.4 ms, n = 785 EPSCs), and the distribution was largely narrowed with individual values of τ EPSC decay ranging from about 1.5 ms to 9 ms (Figure 2B, right panel). Second, concomitant with the speeded decay kinetics, the rise-time of the EPSCs (rise time20%–80%) also appeared faster in the CNIH2 knockdown neuron (mean values of 0.99 ± 0.32 ms and 0.69 ± 0.23 ms), most likely as a result of the accelerated EPSC decay as observed above for the EPSCs of mossy cells versus aspiny interneurons and for GluA tetramers with and without coassembled CNIH2 (Figures 2B and 3A) (Schwenk et al., 2009Schwenk J. Harmel N. Zolles G. Bildl W. Kulik A. Heimrich B. Chisaka O. Jonas P. Schulte U. Fakler B. Klöcker N. Functional proteomics identify cornichon proteins as auxiliary subunits of AMPA receptors.Science. 2009; 323: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Recordings from an additional 32 mossy cells under control conditions, either uninfected (23 cells) or from noninjected brains (9 cells), and 32 sh-CNIH2 transduced mossy cells corroborated the marked effect of the CNIH2 knockdown on the timing of the EPSCs. Thus, the mean values obtained for τ EPSC decay in control mossy cells ranged from 9.3 ms to 17.3 ms and yielded an overall mean (±SEM) of 12.1 ± 0.6 ms (uninfected or noninjected), numbers closely matching the values obtained from the evoked EPSCs in paired recordings (Figure 1C). The knockdown of CNIH2 verified by post hoc analyses (Figure S3) led to a decreased mean τ EPSC decay of 5.6 ± 0.2 ms with a markedly smaller range for the mean values of individual cells (3.3 ms to 7.3 ms; Figure 3B). Strikingly, both the range and the mean value of τ EPSC decay were similar to the values obtained from interneurons that lack expression of CNIH2 (Figures 1 and 2A). While CNIH2 clearly affected EPSC kinetics, neither the amplitude nor the frequency of single EPSCs was altered (Figure 3C), in line with the result that CNIH2 knockdown did not change the expression of GluA proteins or other AMPAR core constituents (Figure S2). As an additional control, we repeated the experiments with lentiviruses where sh-CNIH2 was either not present (GFP-virus, 17 cells) or replaced by a scrambled shRNA designed to not target any gene transcript (sh-control, Alberich-Jordà et al., 2012Alberich-Jordà M. Wouters B. Balastik M. Shapiro-Koss C. Zhang H. Di Ruscio A. Radomska H.S. Ebralidze A.K. Amabile G. Ye M. et al.C/EBPγ deregulation results in differentiation arrest in acute myeloid leukemia.J. Clin. Invest. 2012; 122: 4490-4504Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; 6 cells). In both cases, the results were very similar and did not display any difference to uninfected mossy cells in all parameters evaluated including mean and distribution of τ EPSC decay, rise-time or amplitude of the EPSCs (Figure 4). Together, these results indicated that when CNIH2 is a component of synaptic AMPARs, it dictates the slow decay of EPSCs in hilar mossy cells. If CNIH2-containing AMPARs determine the slow kinetics of hilar mossy cell EPSCs, and the fast EPSCs in aspiny interneurons reflect a lack of CNIH2, then EPSC kinetics in aspiny interneurons should not be affected by the sh-CNIH2. This was probed in transduced and uninfected interneurons by recording spontaneous EPSCs that, also in this type of hilar neuron, occurred at high frequencies (Livsey and Vicini, 1992Livsey C.T. Vicini S. Slower spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in spiny versus aspiny hilar neurons.Neuron. 1992; 8: 745-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). Analyses of the kinetic properties of large numbers of single EPSCs (Figure 5B) in a total of 28 interneurons showed virtually identical results for transduced cells and uninfected controls (Figures 5A–5D). This is demonstrated by τ EPSC decay versus rise time20%–80% plots that displayed very similar scattering ranges (Figure 5A), as well as by the mean values of the τ EPSC decay obtained in 12 transduced and 16 uninfected interneurons (Figure 5C). The latter yielded identical overall mean values of 4.7 ± 1.2 ms (sh-CNIH2) and 4.6 ± 1.2 ms (uninfected/non-injected) and thus closely resembled the results from sh-CNIH2-transduced mossy cells (Figure 3). Similarly, the rise time (values of 0.61 ± 0.19 ms and 0.62 ± 0.12 ms) and the EPSC frequency did not display significant differences (Figure 5D). Merely, the EPSC amplitudes appeared slightly smaller in all transduced interneurons (including those transduced with control viruses) compared to uninfected controls (Figure 5D). Taken together, these results indicated that CNIH2 endows characteristic EPSC timing in a cell-type-specific manner and identify a molecular mechanism to distinctly shape synaptic transmission in mossy cells and aspiny interneurons in the hilar region of the hippocampus. Next, we investigated whether CNIH2 may endow neurons with the slow EPSC phenotype observed in mossy cells. For this purpose, the CNIH2 protein was expressed in interneurons by delivery of a lentivirus (Experimental Procedures) (Gascón et al., 2008Gascón S. Paez-Gomez J.A. Díaz-Guerra M. Scheiffele P. Scholl F.G. Dual-promoter lentiviral vectors for constitutive and regulated gene expression in neurons.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2008; 168: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The spontaneous EPSCs recorded from two representative hilar interneurons (Figure 6A, upper panel), one transduced with the virus driving CNIH2 expression (+CNIH2) and the other a noninfected control cell, together with the respective scatterplots of τ EPSC decay versus rise time20%–80% illustrate the profound effect of the exogenous CNIH2 expression (Figure 6A, lower panel). Both the mean and the scattering range of the τ EPSC decay values determined in the transduced interneuron were increased by several-fold over the uninfected control, resulting in an EPSC phenotype similar to that observed in mossy cells (Figures 2 and 6A). Analyses of the spontaneous EPSCs recordings from a total of 23 interneurons transduced with the +CNIH2 virus further extended on these effects on EPSC timing. Thus, the mean values determined for τ EPSC decay ranged from 8.3 ms to 18.3 ms and yielded an overall mean (±SEM) for CNIH2-expressing interneurons of 11.3 ± 0.5 ms (Figure 6B), a value very close to that obtained for mossy cells (Figure 3). Similar to the viral transductions above (Figure 5), the amplitudes of the EPSCs recorded from CNIH2-expressing interneurons were slightly smaller than those in uninfected control cells (Figure 6B). These results identify CNIH2 as the determinant discriminating the EPSC phenotypes of hilar mossy cells and interneurons and show that CNIH2 expression slows EPSCs when integrated into postsynaptic AMPARs. Interestingly, transduction of mossy cells with the +CNIH2 virus did not result in appreciable changes of the EPSC parameters, suggesting that the CNIH2 protein is present at saturating levels in these neurons (Figure 6C). Finally, we probe"

However, little is known about the overall perception of dieting strategies actually used by the general population.Our main objective was to investigate perceptions of weight-loss practices in an observational study in order to identify the most favourable strategy.Adults from the ongoing Nutrinet-Santé cohort study who had reported engaging in dieting in the three previous years were included in the study. For each diet, detailed information was collected on types of diets, circumstances and perception of the diet, and outcomes. Perceptions were compared across diets using sex-specific mixed effects models.Among the 48 435 subjects who had completed the respective questionnaire, 12 673 (26.7%, 87.8% of women) had followed at least one weight-loss diet in the previous three years. Diet plans prescribed by health professionals and diets conforming to official dietary recommendations were the most favourably perceived among all assessed weight-loss strategies. Alternatively, commercial diet plans and self-imposed dietary restrictions were more negatively perceived (Odds ratios (OR) for adherence difficulty 1.30 (95% confidence interval (0.99;1.7)) in men and OR 1.92 (1.76;2.10) in women compared to official nutritional guidelines; OR 1.06 (0.82;1.38) in men and OR 1.39 (1.26;1.54) in women respectively) compared to official nutritional guidelines.Official dietary recommendations could be useful tools for maintaining a dietary balance while following a weight-loss diet."

Though it is hypothesized that internal signals related to motor commands, known as corollary discharge, serve to generate such predictions, this process remains poorly understood at the neural circuit level. Here we demonstrate that neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish generate negative images of the sensory consequences of the fish’s own movements based on ascending spinal corollary discharge signals. These results generalize previous findings describing mechanisms for generating negative images of the effects of the fish’s specialized electric organ discharge (EOD) and suggest that a cerebellum-like circuit endowed with associative synaptic plasticity acting on corollary discharge can solve the complex and ubiquitous problem of predicting sensory consequences of movements."
https://openalex.org/W2057301087,"Purpose To assess the safety and efficacy of chronic electrical stimulation of the retina with a suprachoroidal visual prosthesis. Methods Seven normally-sighted feline subjects were implanted for 96–143 days with a suprachoroidal electrode array and six were chronically stimulated for 70–105 days at levels that activated the visual cortex. Charge balanced, biphasic, current pulses were delivered to platinum electrodes in a monopolar stimulation mode. Retinal integrity/function and the mechanical stability of the implant were assessed monthly using electroretinography (ERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus photography. Electrode impedances were measured weekly and electrically-evoked visual cortex potentials (eEVCPs) were measured monthly to verify that chronic stimuli were suprathreshold. At the end of the chronic stimulation period, thresholds were confirmed with multi-unit recordings from the visual cortex. Randomized, blinded histological assessments were performed by two pathologists to compare the stimulated and non-stimulated retina and adjacent tissue. Results All subjects tolerated the surgical and stimulation procedure with no evidence of discomfort or unexpected adverse outcomes. After an initial post-operative settling period, electrode arrays were mechanically stable. Mean electrode impedances were stable between 11–15 kΩ during the implantation period. Visually-evoked ERGs & OCT were normal, and mean eEVCP thresholds did not substantially differ over time. In 81 of 84 electrode-adjacent tissue samples examined, there were no discernible histopathological differences between stimulated and unstimulated tissue. In the remaining three tissue samples there were minor focal fibroblastic and acute inflammatory responses. Conclusions Chronic suprathreshold electrical stimulation of the retina using a suprachoroidal electrode array evoked a minimal tissue response and no adverse clinical or histological findings. Moreover, thresholds and electrode impedance remained stable for stimulation durations of up to 15 weeks. This study has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal stimulation with charge balanced stimulus currents."
https://openalex.org/W2002410117,"Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) is a MAPK kinase kinase kinase which is involved in a wide range of cellular responses, including apoptosis, lymphocyte adhesion and trafficking. The contribution of Mst1 to Ag-specific immune responses and autoimmunity has not been well defined. In this study, we provide evidence for the essential role of Mst1 in T cell differentiation and autoimmunity, using both genetic and pharmacologic approaches. Absence of Mst1 in mice reduced T cell proliferation and IL-2 production in vitro, blocked cell cycle progression, and elevated activation-induced cell death in Th1 cells. Mst1 deficiency led to a CD4+ T cell development path that was biased toward Th2 and immunoregulatory cytokine production with suppressed Th1 responses. In addition, Mst1-/- B cells showed decreased stimulation to B cell mitogens in vitro and deficient Ag-specific Ig production in vivo. Consistent with altered lymphocyte function, deletion of Mst1 reduced the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and protected against collagen-induced arthritis development. Mst1-/- CD4+ T cells displayed an intrinsic defect in their ability to respond to encephalitogenic antigens and deletion of Mst1 in the CD4+ T cell compartment was sufficient to alleviate CNS inflammation during EAE. These findings have prompted the discovery of novel compounds that are potent inhibitors of Mst1 and exhibit desirable pharmacokinetic properties. In conclusion, this report implicates Mst1 as a critical regulator of adaptive immune responses, Th1/Th2-dependent cytokine production, and as a potential therapeutic target for immune disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2111208184,"The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) is an introduced species in Europe with a continually expanding range. Since the species is capable of affecting local ecosystems and is a vector for a number of severe zoonotic diseases, it is important to understand its food habits. Raccoon dog diet was studied in Estonia by examining the contents of 223 stomach samples collected during the coldest period of the year, August to March, in 2010-2012. The most frequently consumed food categories were anthropogenic plants (e.g. cereals, fruits; FO = 56.1%) and carrion (e.g. carcasses of artiodactyls and carnivores; FO = 48.4%). Carrion was also the only food category that was consumed significantly more frequently by raccoon dogs exhibiting symptoms of sarcoptic mange than by uninfected animals. Small mammals, which represent intermediate hosts for the zoonotic tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis, were more commonly recorded in samples also containing anthropogenic plants than expected by chance. Comparison of raccoon dog and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) diet in Estonia revealed higher overlap than found elsewhere in Europe, with 'carrion' and 'anthropogenic plants' making up the bulk of both species' diet; however, raccoon dogs were more omnivorous than red foxes. Our results suggest that while the use of most food categories reflects the phenology of natural food sources, 'anthropogenic plants' and 'carrion' provide an essential resource for raccoon dogs during the coldest period of the year, with the latter resource especially important for individuals infected with sarcoptic mange. Since both of these food categories and small mammals are often found at supplementary feeding sites for wild boar (Sus scrofa), this game management practice may facilitate high densities of mesocarnivores and promote the spread of some severe zoonotic diseases, including alveolar echinococcosis, trichinellosis, rabies and sarcoptic mange."

Two cows aborted during the studied period; spleen and brain samples or meconium swabs were tested by real-time PCR, in none of the fetuses SBV-specific RNA was detectable and the tested fetal sera were negative in a commercially available antibody ELISA. In contrast, in nine clinically healthy calves high SBV-antibody titers were measurable before colostrum intake, and in meconium swabs of six of these animals viral RNA was present as well. The mothers of all nine seropositive calves were presumably infected between days 47 and 162 of gestation, which is within the critical timeframe for fetal infection suggested for SBV and related viruses."

Importantly, the reciprocal connection between autistic traits and face perception has rarely been examined within the typically developing population. In this study, university participants from the social sciences, physical sciences, and humanities completed a battery of measures that assessed face, object and emotion recognition abilities, general perceptual-cognitive style, and sub-clinical autistic traits (the Autism Quotient (AQ)). We employed separate hierarchical multiple regression analyses to evaluate which factors could predict face recognition scores and AQ scores. Gender, object recognition performance, and AQ scores predicted face recognition behaviour. Specifically, males, individuals with more autistic traits, and those with lower object recognition scores performed more poorly on the face recognition test. Conversely, university major, gender and face recognition performance reliably predicted AQ scores. Science majors, males, and individuals with poor face recognition skills showed more autistic-like traits. These results suggest that the broader autism phenotype is associated with lower face recognition abilities, even among typically developing individuals."

Most studies which analyzed the risk of femoral fractures in patients with idiopathic PD were performed either in specialized centers or excluded very frail patients. The current study used a large population-based dataset in order to analyze the risk of femoral fractures in patients with idiopathic PD.Data from more than 880.000 individuals aged 65 years or older and insured between 2004 and 2009 at a large German health insurance company were used for the analyses. Persons with idiopathic PD were identified by the dispensing of Parkinson-specific medication and by hospital diagnoses, if available. People without PD served as the reference group. Incident femoral fractures were obtained from hospital diagnoses. Analyses were stratified by gender and information on severe functional impairment (care need) as provided by reimbursement claims.Compared with the reference group, persons with idiopathic PD had a more than doubled risk to sustain a femoral fracture. The risk was higher in men (HR = 2.61; 95%-CI: 2.28-2.98) than in women (HR = 1.79; 95%-CI: 1.66-1.94). The increased risk was only observed in people without severe functional impairment. The sensitivity analysis using a refined definition of idiopathic PD patients yielded similar results.The findings confirm the increased risk of femoral fractures in patients with idiopathic PD. The relative risk is particularly high in male PD patients and in patients without severe functional impairment."

The results indicated that three potential marker compounds (isomer of campneoside II, cistanoside C, and cistanoside A) were obtained to discriminate the two origins by PCA and OPLS-DA analyses. DNA barcoding enabled to differentiate two origins accurately. NJ tree showed that two origins clustered into two clades. Our findings demonstrate that the two origins of Cistanches Herba possess different chemical compositions and genetic variation.

https://openalex.org/W2022818667,"Ghrelin, the endogenous growth hormone secretagogue, has an important role in metabolic homeostasis. It exists in two major molecular forms: acylated (AG) and unacylated (UAG). Many studies suggest different roles for these two forms of ghrelin in energy balance regulation. In the present study, we compared the effects of acute intracerebroventricular administration of AG, UAG and their combination (AG+UAG) to young adult Wistar rats on food intake and central melanocortin system modulation. Although UAG did not affect food intake it significantly increased the number of c-Fos positive neurons in the arcuate (ARC), paraventricular (PVN) and solitary tract (NTS) nuclei. In contrast, UAG suppressed AG-induced neuronal activity in PVN and NTS. Central UAG also modulated hypothalamic expression of Mc4r and Bmp8b, which were increased and Mc3r, Pomc, Agrp and Ucp2, which were decreased. Finally, UAG, AG and combination treatments caused activation of c-Fos in POMC expressing neurons in the arcuate, substantiating a physiologic effect of these peptides on the central melanocortin system. Together, these results demonstrate that UAG can act directly to increase neuronal activity in the hypothalamus and is able to counteract AG-induced neuronal activity in the PVN and NTS. UAG also modulates expression of members of the melanocortin signaling system in the hypothalamus. In the absence of an effect on energy intake, these findings indicate that UAG could affect energy homeostasis by modulation of the central melanocortin system."
https://openalex.org/W2042310756,"Previous studies showed that prostacyclin inhibited fibrosis. However, both receptors of prostacyclin, prostacyclin receptor (IP) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), are abundant in cardiac fibroblasts. Here we investigated which receptor was vital in the anti-fibrosis effect of prostacyclin. In addition, the possible mechanism involved in protective effects of prostacyclin against cardiac fibrosis was also studied. We found that beraprost, a prostacyclin analogue, inhibited angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. Beraprost also suppressed Ang II-induced collagen I mRNA expression and protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts. After IP expression was knocked down by siRNA, Ang II-induced proliferation and collagen I synthesis could no longer be rescued by beraprost. However, treating cells with different specific inhibitors of PPAR subtypes prior to beraprost and Ang II stimulation, all of the above attenuating effects of beraprost were still available. Moreover, beraprost significantly blocked transforming growth factor β (TGF β) expression as well as Smad2 phosphorylation and reduced Smad-DNA binding activity. Beraprost also increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) at Ser133 in the nucleus. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that beraprost increased CREB but decreased Smad2 binding to CREB-binding protein (CBP) in nucleus. In conclusion, beraprost inhibits cardiac fibroblast proliferation by activating IP and suppressing TGF β-Smad signal pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2004293545,"Methanol is widely used in industrial processes, and as such, is discharged in large quantities in wastewater. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have the potential to recover electric energy from organic pollutants in wastewater; however, the use of MFCs to generate electricity from methanol has not been reported. In the present study, we developed single-chamber MFCs that generated electricity from methanol at the maximum power density of 220 mW m−2 (based on the projected area of the anode). In order to reveal how microbes generate electricity from methanol, pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA-gene amplicons and Illumina shotgun sequencing of metagenome were conducted. The pyrosequencing detected in abundance Dysgonomonas, Sporomusa, and Desulfovibrio in the electrolyte and anode and cathode biofilms, while Geobacter was detected only in the anode biofilm. Based on known physiological properties of these bacteria, it is considered that Sporomusa converts methanol into acetate, which is then utilized by Geobacter to generate electricity. This speculation is supported by results of shotgun metagenomics of the anode-biofilm microbes, which reconstructed relevant catabolic pathways in these bacteria. These results suggest that methanol is anaerobically catabolized by syntrophic bacterial consortia with electrodes as electron acceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2000991146,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common human enzyme defect and affects more than 400 million people worldwide. This deficiency is believed to protect against malaria because its global distribution is similar. However, this genetic disorder may be associated with potential hemolytic anemia after treatment with anti-malarials, primaquine or other 8-aminoquinolines. Although primaquine is used for malaria prevention, no study has previously investigated the prevalence of G6PD variants and G6PD deficiency in the Republic of Korea (ROK).Two commercialized test kits (Trinity G-6-PDH and CareStart G6PD test) were used for G6PD deficiency screening. The seven common G6PD variants were investigated by DiaPlexC kit in blood samples obtained living in vivax malaria endemic regions in the ROK.Of 1,044 blood samples tested using the CareStart G6PD test, none were positive for G6PD deficiency. However, a slightly elevated level of G6PD activity was observed in 14 of 1,031 samples tested with the Trinity G-6-PDH test. Forty-nine of the 298 samples with non-specific amplification by DiaPlexC kit were confirmed by sequencing to be negative for the G6PD variants.No G6PD deficiency was observed using phenotypic- or genetic-based tests in individuals residing in vivax malaria endemic regions in the ROK. Because massive chemoprophylaxis using primaquine has been performed in the ROK military to kill hypnozoites responsible for relapse and latent stage vivax malaria, further regular monitoring is essential for the safe administration of primaquine."
https://openalex.org/W2023964101,"Chronic stress can affect skin function, and some skin diseases might be triggered or aggravated by stress. Stress can activate the central hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which causes glucocorticoid levels to increase. The skin has HPA axis elements that react to environmental stressors to regulate skin functions, such as melanogenesis. This study explores the mechanism whereby chronic stress affects skin pigmentation, focusing on the HPA axis, and investigates the role of glucocorticoids in this pathway. We exposed C57BL/6 male mice to two types of chronic stress, chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Mice subjected to either stress condition showed reduced melanogenesis. Interestingly, CRS and CUMS triggered reductions in the mRNA expression levels of key factors involved in the HPA axis in the skin. In mice administered corticosterone, decreased melanin synthesis and reduced expression of HPA axis elements were observed. The reduced expression of HPA axis elements and melanogenesis in the skin of stressed mice were reversed by RU486 (a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) treatment. Glucocorticoids had no significant inhibitory effect on melanogenesis in vitro. These results suggest that, high levels of serum corticosterone induced by chronic stress can reduce the expression of elements of the skin HPA axis by glucocorticoid-dependent negative feedback. These activities can eventually result in decreased skin pigmentation. Our findings raise the possibility that chronic stress could be a risk factor for depigmentation by disrupting the cutaneous HPA axis and should prompt dermatologists to exercise more caution when using glucocorticoids for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2029787919,"Sponges (Phylum Porifera) are an evolutionary and ecologically significant group; however information on processes influencing sponge population distributions is surprisingly limited. Carteriospongia foliascens is a common Indo-Pacific sponge, which has been reported from the intertidal to the mesophotic. Interestingly, the distribution of C. foliascens at inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef is restricted to the intertidal with no individuals evident in adjacent subtidal habitats. The abundance of C. foliascens and substrate availability was first quantified to investigate the influence of substrate limitation on adult distribution. Pre-settlement processes of larval spawning, swimming speeds, phototaxis, vertical migration, and settlement to intertidal and subtidal substrate cues were also quantified. Notably, suitable settlement substrate (coral rubble) was not limiting in subtidal habitats. C. foliascens released up to 765 brooded larvae sponge−1 day−1 during the day, with larvae (80%±5.77) being negatively phototactic and migrating to the bottom within 40 minutes from release. Subsequently, larvae (up to 58.67%±2.91) migrated to the surface after the loss of the daylight cue (nightfall), and after 34 h post-release >98.67% (±0.67) of larvae had adopted a benthic habit regardless of light conditions. Intertidal and subtidal biofilms initiated similar settlement responses, inducing faster (as early 6 h post-release) and more successful metamorphosis (>60%) than unconditioned surfaces. C. foliascens has a high larval supply and larval behaviours that support recruitment to the subtidal. The absence of C. foliascens in subtidal habitats at inshore reefs is therefore proposed to be a potential consequence of post-settlement mortalities."
https://openalex.org/W2020164411,"In this study, we evaluated the effect of replacing dietary fiber with sodium butyrate on reproductive performance and antioxidant defense in a high fat diet during pregnancy by using a rat model. Eighty virgin female Sprague Dawley rats were fed one of four diets—(1) control diet (C group), (2) high fat + high fiber diet (HF group), (3) high-fat +5% sodium butyrate diet (SB group), and (4) HF diet + α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHC group)—intraperitoneally on days 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 of gestation. SB and dietary fiber had similar effects on improving fetal number and reducing the abortion rate; however, the anti-oxidant capacity of maternal serum, placenta, and fetus was superior in the HF group than in the SB group. In comparison, CHC injection decreased reproductive performance and antioxidant defense. Both dietary fiber (DF) and SB supplementation had a major but different effect on the expression of anti-oxidant related genes and nutrient transporters genes. In summary, our data indicate that SB and DF showed similar effect on reproductive performance, but SB cannot completely replace the DF towards with respect to redox regulation in high-fat diet; and SB might influence offspring metabolism and health differently to DF."
https://openalex.org/W1973752617,"Endothelin (ET)-1 is known for the most potent vasoconstrictive peptide that is released mainly from endothelial cells. Several studies have reported ET-1 signaling is involved in the process of wound healing or fibrosis as well as vasodilation. However, little is known about the role of ET-1 in these processes. To clarify its mechanism, we compared skin fibrogenesis and wound repair between vascular endothelial cell-specific ET-1 knockout mice and their wild-type littermates. Bleomycin-injected fibrotic skin of the knockout mice showed significantly decreased skin thickness and collagen content compared to that of wild-type mice, indicating that bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis is attenuated in the knockout mice. The mRNA levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β were decreased in the bleomycin-treated skin of ET-1 knockout mice. On the other hand, skin wound healing was accelerated in ET-1 knockout mice, which was indicated by earlier granulation tissue reduction and re-epithelialization in these mice. The mRNA levels of TGF-β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were reduced in the wound of ET-1 knockout mice. In endothelial ET-1 knockout mouse, the expression of TNF-α, CTGF and TGF-β was down-regulated. Bosentan, an antagonist of dual ET receptors, is known to attenuate skin fibrosis and accelerate wound healing in systemic sclerosis, and such contradictory effect may be mediated by above molecules. The endothelial cell-derived ET-1 is the potent therapeutic target in fibrosis or wound healing, and investigations of the overall regulatory mechanisms of these pathological conditions by ET-1 may lead to a new therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1996498123,"To comprehend the phylogeographic patterns of genetic variation in anurans at Taiwan Island, this study attempted to examine (1) the existence of various geological barriers (Central Mountain Ranges, CMRs); and (2) the genetic variation of Bufo bankorensis using mtDNA sequences among populations located in different regions of Taiwan, characterized by different climates and existing under extreme conditions when compared available sequences of related species B. gargarizans of mainland China.Phylogenetic analyses of the dataset with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop gene (348 bp) recovered a close relationship between B. bankorensis and B. gargarizans, identified three distinct lineages. Furthermore, the network of mtDNA D-loop gene (564 bp) amplified (279 individuals, 27 localities) from Taiwan Island indicated three divergent clades within B. bankorensis (Clade W, E and S), corresponding to the geography, thereby verifying the importance of the CMRs and Kaoping River drainage as major biogeographic barriers. Mismatch distribution analysis, neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots revealed that a significant population expansion occurred for the total population and Clade W, with horizons dated to approximately 0.08 and 0.07 Mya, respectively. These results suggest that the population expansion of Taiwan Island species B. bankorensis might have resulted from the release of available habitat in post-glacial periods, the genetic variation on mtDNA showing habitat selection, subsequent population dispersal, and co-distribution among clades.The multiple origins (different clades) of B. bankorensis mtDNA sequences were first evident in this study. The divergent genetic clades found within B. bankorensis could be independent colonization by previously diverged lineages; inferring B. bankorensis originated from B. gargarizans of mainland China, then dispersal followed by isolation within Taiwan Island. Highly divergent clades between W and E of B. bankorensis, implies that the CMRs serve as a genetic barrier and separated the whole island into the western and eastern phylogroups."

Under the assumption of randomly fluctuating correlations, a lower bound for the estimation of the loss distribution is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2080141786,"The 26S proteasome plays a fundamental role in almost all eukaryotic cells, including vascular endothelial cells. However, it remains largely unknown how proteasome functionality is regulated in the vasculature. Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS)-derived NO is known to be essential to maintain endothelial homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to establish the connection between endothelial NO and 26S proteasome functionality in vascular endothelial cells. The 26S proteasome reporter protein levels, 26S proteasome activity, and the O-GlcNAcylation of Rpt2, a key subunit of the proteasome regulatory complex, were assayed in 26S proteasome reporter cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and mouse aortic tissues isolated from 26S proteasome reporter and eNOS knockout mice. Like the other selective NO donors, NO derived from activated eNOS (by pharmacological and genetic approach) increased O-GlcNAc modification of Rpt2, reduced proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity, and caused 26S proteasome reporter protein accumulation. Conversely, inactivation of eNOS reversed all the effects. SiRNA knockdown of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the key enzyme that catalyzes protein O-GlcNAcylation, abolished NO-induced effects. Consistently, adenoviral overexpression of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), the enzyme catalyzing the removal of the O-GlcNAc group, mimicked the effects of OGT knockdown. Finally, compared to eNOS wild type aortic tissues, 26S proteasome reporter mice lacking eNOS exhibited elevated 26S proteasome functionality in parallel with decreased Rpt2 O-GlcNAcylation, without changing the levels of Rpt2 protein. In conclusion, the eNOS-derived NO functions as a physiological suppressor of the 26S proteasome in vascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132313162,"Background Previous studies have suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an independent risk factor for lung cancer. There are some evidence that people with diabetes are at a risk of developing many forms of cancer, but inconclusive with regard to lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether COPD with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influences the risk of developing lung cancer. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study consisting of 20,730 subjects newly diagnosed with COPD (“cases”). Their data was collected from the National Health Insurance system of Taiwan from 1998 to 2010. Among these patients, 5,820 patients had T2DM and 14,910 patients did not have T2DM. The retrospective matched control group consisted of 20,729 subjects without either COPD or T2DM. The control group was matched with the cases for sex, age, and index year (the year that the patient was diagnosed with COPD). The subjects were followed until the end of 2011. Results The findings of our study showed that the risk of lung cancer was higher in the COPD group than in the non-COPD group, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.23–5.94] among total case group, adjusted HR was 5.38 (95% CI = 4.52–6.40) in the cohort without T2DM and adjusted HR was 4.05 (95% CI = 3.26–5.03) in the cohort with T2DM. We observed a significantly protective effect from lung cancer (adjusted HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.63–0.90) of diabetic cohort than non-diabetic cohort among patients with COPD. Conclusion Patients with COPD had a significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer than healthy people. However, there was a protective effect of T2DM for lung cancer among patients with COPD. Further investigation may be needed to corroborate the mechanism or bring up reliable reasons."

Growth at 5 to 7°C of these isolates in milk resulted in high lipolysis and the production of bacterial inhibitors. The two main bacterial inhibitors have a molecular weight of 1168.7 and 1140.7 Da respectively, are heat-tolerant and inhibit Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis, the test strain of most of the commercially available microbiological inhibitor tests for screening of antibiotic residues in milk. Furthermore, these bacterial inhibitors show antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis and also interfere negatively with yoghurt production. Following their isolation and purification with RP-HPLC, the inhibitors were identified by NMR analysis as cyclic lipodepsipeptides of the viscosin group. Our findings bring to light a new challenge for quality control in the dairy industry. By prolonging the refrigerated storage of raw milk, the keeping quality of milk is influenced by growth and metabolic activities of psychrotrophic bacteria such as pseudomonads. Besides an increased risk of possible spoilage of long shelf-life milk, the production at low temperature of natural bacterial inhibitors may also result in false-positive results for antibiotic residue screening tests based on microbial inhibitor assays thus leading to undue production loss."
https://openalex.org/W1976647028,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is a persistent pollutant with known neurotoxic effects. We have previously shown that astrocytes accumulate MeHg and play a prominent role in mediating MeHg toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS) by altering glutamate signaling, generating oxidative stress, depleting glutathione (GSH) and initiating lipid peroxidation. Interestingly, all of these pathways can be regulated by the constitutively expressed, 90-kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90. As Hsp90 function is regulated by oxidative stress, we hypothesized that MeHg disrupts Hsp90-client protein functions. Astrocytes were treated with MeHg and expression of Hsp90, as well as the abundance of complexes of Hsp90-neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and Hsp90-prostaglandin E synthase/p23 (PGES/p23) were assessed. MeHg exposure decreased Hsp90 protein expression following 12 h of treatment while shorter exposures had no effect on Hsp90 protein expression. Interestingly, following 1 or 6 h of MeHg exposure, Hsp90 binding to PGES/p23 or nNOS was significantly increased, resulting in increased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis from MeHg-treated astrocytes. These effects were attenuated by the Hsp90 antagonist, geldanmycin. NOS activity was increased following MeHg treatment while cGMP formation was decreased. This was accompanied by an increase in •O2- and H2O2 levels, suggesting that MeHg uncouples NO formation from NO-dependent signaling and increases oxidative stress. Altogether, our data demonstrates that Hsp90 interactions with client proteins are increased following MeHg exposure, but over time Hsp90 levels decline, contributing to oxidative stress and MeHg-dependent excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2000524731,"PhyC levels have been observed to be markedly lower in phyB mutants than in Arabidopsis or rice wild type etiolated seedlings, but the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been fully elucidated.In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which phyB affects the protein concentration and photo-sensing abilities of phyC and demonstrated that rice phyC exists predominantly as phyB/phyC heterodimers in etiolated seedlings. PHYC-GFP protein was detected when expressed in phyA phyC mutants, but not in phyA phyB mutants, suggesting that phyC requires phyB for its photo-sensing abilities. Interestingly, when a mutant PHYB gene that has no chromophore binding site, PHYB(C364A), was introduced into phyB mutants, the phyC level was restored. Moreover, when PHYB(C364A) was introduced into phyA phyB mutants, the seedlings exhibited de-etiolation under both far-red light (FR) and red light (R) conditions, while the phyA phyB mutants were blind to both FR and R. These results are the first direct evidence that phyC is responsible for regulating seedling de-etiolation under both FR and R. These findings also suggest that phyB is indispensable for the expression and function of phyC, which depends on the formation of phyB/phyC heterodimers.The present report clearly demonstrates the similarities and differences in the properties of phyC between Arabidopsis and rice and will advance our understanding of phytochrome functions in monocots and dicots."

EGFR targeted therapies have demonstrated clinical benefit for SCCHN treatment. In this report, we investigated the pre-clinical efficacy of Dacomitinib (PF-00299804), an irreversible pan-ErbB inhibitor, both alone and in combination with ionizing radiation (IR), a primary curative modality for SCCHN. One normal oral epithelial (NOE) and three SCCHN (FaDu, UT-SCC-8, UT-SCC-42a) cell lines were used to conduct cell viability, clonogenic survival, cell cycle, and immunoblotting assays in vitro, using increasing doses of Dacomitinib (10-500 nM), both with and without IR (2-4 Gy). The FaDu xenograft model was utilized for tumor growth delay assays in vivo, and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted on extracted tumors. A dose-dependent reduction in cell viability and clonogenic survival after Dacomitinib treatment was observed in all three SCCHN models. Treatment led to a significant reduction in EGFR signalling, with a subsequent decrease in phosphorylation of downstream targets such as ERK, AKT, and mTOR. In vivo, Dacomitinib treatment delayed tumor growth, while decreasing phospho-EGFR and Ki-67 immunoexpression. These effects were further enhanced when combined with IR, both in vitro and in vivo. The preclinical data support the further evaluations of Dacomitinib combined with IR for the future management of patients with SCCHN."
https://openalex.org/W2054508980,"Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the most poisonous substances known and its eight toxin types (A to H) are distinguished by the inability of polyclonal antibodies that neutralize one toxin type to neutralize any of the other seven toxin types. Infant botulism, an intestinal toxemia orphan disease, is the most common form of human botulism in the United States. It results from swallowed spores of Clostridium botulinum (or rarely, neurotoxigenic Clostridium butyricum or Clostridium baratii) that germinate and temporarily colonize the lumen of the large intestine, where, as vegetative cells, they produce botulinum toxin. Botulinum neurotoxin is encoded by the bont gene that is part of a toxin gene cluster that includes several accessory genes. We sequenced for the first time the complete botulinum neurotoxin gene cluster of nonproteolytic C. baratii type F7. Like the type E and the nonproteolytic type F6 botulinum toxin gene clusters, the C. baratii type F7 had an orfX toxin gene cluster that lacked the regulatory botR gene which is found in proteolytic C. botulinum strains and codes for an alternative σ factor. In the absence of botR, we identified a putative alternative regulatory gene located upstream of the C. baratii type F7 toxin gene cluster. This putative regulatory gene codes for a predicted σ factor that contains DNA-binding-domain homologues to the DNA-binding domains both of BotR and of other members of the TcdR-related group 5 of the σ70 family that are involved in the regulation of toxin gene expression in clostridia. We showed that this TcdR-related protein in association with RNA polymerase core enzyme specifically binds to the C. baratii type F7 botulinum toxin gene cluster promoters. This TcdR-related protein may therefore be involved in regulating the expression of the genes of the botulinum toxin gene cluster in neurotoxigenic C. baratii."
https://openalex.org/W2089762631,"The importance of sperm capacitation for mammalian fertilization has been confirmed in the present study via sperm metabolism. Involvement of the metabolic enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) and its E3 subunit, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) in hamster in vitro fertilization (IVF) via in vitro sperm capacitation is being proposed through regulation of sperm intracellular lactate, pH and calcium.Capacitated hamster spermatozoa were allowed to fertilize hamster oocytes in vitro which were then assessed for fertilization, microscopically. PDHc/DLD was inhibited by the use of the specific DLD-inhibitor, MICA (5-methoxyindole-2-carboxylic acid). Oocytes fertilized with MICA-treated (MT) [and thus PDHc/DLD-inhibited] spermatozoa showed defective fertilization where 2nd polar body release and pronuclei formation were not observed. Defective fertilization was attributable to capacitation failure owing to high lactate and low intracellular pH and calcium in MT-spermatozoa during capacitation. Moreover, this defect could be overcome by alkalinizing spermatozoa, before fertilization. Increasing intracellular calcium in spermatozoa pre-IVF and in defectively-fertilized oocytes, post-fertilization rescued the arrest seen, suggesting the role of intracellular calcium from either of the gametes in fertilization. Parallel experiments carried out with control spermatozoa capacitated in medium with low extracellular pH or high lactate substantiated the necessity of optimal sperm intracellular lactate levels, intracellular pH and calcium during sperm capacitation, for proper fertilization.This study confirms the importance of pyruvate/lactate metabolism in capacitating spermatozoa for successful fertilization, besides revealing for the first time the importance of sperm PDHc/ DLD in fertilization, via the modulation of sperm intracellular lactate, pH and calcium during capacitation. In addition, the observations made in the IVF studies in hamsters suggest that capacitation failures could be a plausible cause of unsuccessful fertilization encountered during human assisted reproductive technologies, like IVF and ICSI. Our studies indicate a role of sperm capacitation in the post-penetration events during fertilization."

Interestingly, plants can actively regulate water transport using ion-mediated responses and adapt to environmental changes. However, ionic effects on active water transport in vascular plants remain unclear. In this report, the interactive ionic effects on sap transport were systematically investigated for the first time by visualizing the uptake process of ionic solutions of different ion compositions (K+/Ca2+) using synchrotron X-ray and neutron imaging techniques. Ionic solutions with lower K+/Ca2+ ratios induced an increased sap flow rate in stems of Olea europaea L. and Laurus nobilis L. The different ascent rates of ionic solutions depending on K+/Ca2+ ratios at a fixed total concentration increases our understanding of ion-responsiveness in plants from a physicochemical standpoint. Based on these results, effective structural changes in the pit membrane were observed using varying ionic ratios of K+/Ca2+. The formation of electrostatically induced hydrodynamic layers and the ion-responsiveness of hydrogel structures based on Hofmeister series increase our understanding of the mechanism of ion-mediated sap flow control in plants."

Based on past studies in breast cancer cells and model systems, endoxifen classically functions as an anti-estrogenic compound. Since estrogen and estrogen receptors play critical roles in mediating bone homeostasis, and endoxifen is currently being implemented as a novel breast cancer therapy, we sought to comprehensively characterize the in vivo effects of endoxifen on the mouse skeleton. Two month old ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle or 50 mg/kg/day endoxifen hydrochloride via oral gavage for 45 days. Animals were analyzed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography, micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry. Serum from control and endoxifen treated mice was evaluated for bone resorption and bone formation markers. Gene expression changes were monitored in osteoblasts, osteoclasts and the cortical shells of long bones from endoxifen treated mice and in a human fetal osteoblast cell line. Endoxifen treatment led to significantly higher bone mineral density and bone mineral content throughout the skeleton relative to control animals. Endoxifen treatment also resulted in increased numbers of osteoblasts and osteoclasts per tissue area, which was corroborated by increased serum levels of bone formation and resorption markers. Finally, endoxifen induced the expression of osteoblast, osteoclast and osteocyte marker genes. These studies are the first to examine the in vivo and in vitro impacts of endoxifen on bone and our results demonstrate that endoxifen increases cancellous as well as cortical bone mass in ovariectomized mice, effects that may have implications for postmenopausal breast cancer patients."

The identification of cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses, however, has been hampered due to insufficiencies in the techniques used to detect the (−)-strand RNA species. Here, we employed a method of head-to-tail ligation and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect and quantitate the synthesis of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) defective interfering (DI) RNA (−) strands. Furthermore, using the aforementioned techniques along with Northern blot assay, we specifically defined the cis-acting RNA elements within the 3′-terminal 55 nucleotides (nts) which function in the synthesis of (−)- or (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA. The major findings are as follows: (i) nts from -5 to -39 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are the cis-acting elements responsible for (−)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, (ii) nts from −3 to −34 within the 3′-terminal 55 nts are cis-acting elements required for (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis, and (iii) the nucleotide species at the 3′-most position (−1) is important, but not critical, for both (−)- and (+)-strand BCoV DI RNA synthesis. These results demonstrate that the 3′-terminal 55 nts in BCoV DI RNA harbor cis-acting RNA elements required for both (−)- and (+)-strand DI RNA synthesis and extend our knowledge on the mechanisms of coronavirus replication. The method of head-to-tail ligation and qRT-PCR employed in the study may also be applied to identify other cis-acting elements required for (−)-strand RNA synthesis in coronaviruses."

Unfortunately, subgraph querying is very time consuming since it involves subgraph isomorphism testing that is known to be an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a novel coding method for subgraph querying that is based on Laplacian spectrum and the number of walks. Our method follows the filtering-and-verification framework and works well on graph databases with frequent updates. We also propose novel two-step filtering conditions that can filter out most false positives and prove that the two-step filtering conditions satisfy the no-false-negative requirement (no dismissal in answers). Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic graphs show that, compared with six existing counterpart methods, our method can effectively improve the efficiency of subgraph querying."
