https://openalex.org/W2150767656,"Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of membrane-bound transcription factors that regulate cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis. In mammals, three SREBP isoforms designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 have been identified. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are derived from the same gene by virtue of alternatively spliced first exons. SREBP-1a has a longer transcriptional activation domain and is a more potent transcriptional activator than SREBP-1c in cultured cells and liver. Here, we describe the physiologic consequences of overexpressing the nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nSREBP-1a) in adipocytes of mice using the adipocyte-specific aP2 promoter (aP2-nSREBP-1a). The transgenic aP2-nSREBP-1a mice developed markedly enlarged white and brown adipocytes that were fully differentiated. Adipocytes isolated from aP2-nSREBP-1a mice had significantly increased rates of fatty acid synthesis and enhanced fatty acid secretion. The increased production and release of fatty acids from adipocytes led, in turn, to a fatty liver. Overexpression of the alternative SREBP-1 isoform, nSREBP-1c, in adipose tissue inhibits adipocyte differentiation; as a result, the transgenic nSREBP-1c mice develop a syndrome resembling human lipodystrophy, which includes a loss of peripheral white adipose tissue, diabetes, and fatty livers (Shimomura, I., Hammer, R. E., Richardson, J. A., Ikemoto, S., Bashmakov, Y., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (1998) Genes Dev. 12, 3182–3194). In striking contrast, nSREBP-1a overexpression in fat resulted in the hypertrophy of fully differentiated adipocytes, no diabetes, and mild hepatic steatosis. These results suggest that nSREBP-1a and nSREBP-1c have distinct roles in adipocyte fat metabolism in vivo.

Obesity is an ever-increasing public health concern that it is now estimated to afflict at least one-third of the United States population (2Mokdad A.H. Bowman B.A. Ford E.S. Vinicor F. Marks J.S.

Understanding how progenitor cells differentiate into adipocytes may be critical for the development of anti-obesity therapies.Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: SREBPs, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; nSREBP, nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; C/EBPα, cCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; UCP-1, uncoupling protein-1; FFA, free fatty acid; Pref-1, preadipocyte factor-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.1The abbreviations used are: SREBPs, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins; nSREBP, nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein; WAT, white adipose tissue; BAT, brown adipose tissue; C/EBPα, cCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; UCP-1, uncoupling protein-1; FFA, free fatty acid; Pref-1, preadipocyte factor-1; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α. are a family of membrane-bound transcription factors that principally regulate lipid synthesis (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar), but they have also been implicated in adipocyte differentiation (1Shimomura I. Hammer R.E.

SREBPs belong to the larger basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors, but are unique because they are synthesized as ∼1150-amino acid precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). To be active, SREBPs undergo a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the transcriptionally active NH2-terminal portion of the protein, designated the nuclear form. Once the nuclear form is released from the membrane, it can enter the nucleus and bind to the promoters of target genes to activate transcription.Three SREBP isoforms (designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2) have been identified in humans and animals (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are encoded by the same gene that undergoes alternative splicing in which the two transcripts are driven by different promoters (6Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 7Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1995; 25: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c differ only in the first exon, which encodes a portion of an acidic transcriptional activation domain (6Yokoyama C. Wang X. Briggs M.R. Admon A. Wu J. Hua X. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 7Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1995; 25: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a has a longer activation domain and is much more potent than SREBP-1c in transcriptionally activating known target genes in cultured cells (8Pai J.-t. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and liver (9Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of the SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c transcripts differ among cells and organs. SREBP-1a is the predominant transcript in most cultured cells. In most animal tissues, including liver and adipose tissue, the SREBP-1c transcript is predominant (10Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 11Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc.

A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The third SREBP isoform, designated SREBP-2, is produced by a different gene, and it contains a long acidic activation domain resembling that of SREBP-1a (13Hua X. Yokoyama C. Wu J. Briggs M.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Wang X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11603-11607Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar).In liver, all SREBP isoforms are capable of activating the same families of genes, but they do so with varying relative efficiencies. SREBP-2 preferentially activates multiple genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, whereas SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c preferentially activate genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides (14Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3683) Google Scholar). The function and transcriptional activation properties of SREBPs in tissues other than liver have been only partially characterized. Of particular interest is the in vivo function of SREBPs in adipocytes owing to the potential role SREBP-1 isoforms may have in adipogenesis (4Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar).Overexpression of transcriptionally active nuclear SREBP-1c (nSREBP-1c) in adipocytes of transgenic mice using the fat-specific aP2 promoter inhibits adipocyte differentiation and produces a syndrome in mice that shares the general features of congenital generalized lipodystrophy in humans (1Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The amount of white adipose tissue (WAT) in the lipodystrophic mice is markedly reduced, and many of the residual cells have the histologic appearance of immature adipocytes. These changes are associated with a marked reduction in many mRNAs encoding genes involved in adipogenesis such as C/EBPα, PPARγ, and adipsin. The majority of adipocytes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) are histologically similar to immature white adipocytes. The mRNAs for uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) and the additional adipogenic genes listed above are also markedly reduced. The transgenic mice also exhibit profound insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and enlarged fatty livers.To investigate the physiologic function of the SREBP-1a isoform in adipocytes, we have produced transgenic mice that overexpress transcriptionally active nSREBP-1a in WAT and BAT using the aP2 enhancer/promoter (aP2-nSREBP-1a mice). The phenotype of aP2-nSREBP-1a mice differs completely from that observed in aP2-nSREBP-1c mice (1Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Overexpression of nSREBP-1a in adipose tissue did not inhibit adipocyte differentiation, but rather activated the entire pathway of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic genes, leading to increased lipid accumulation in the adipocytes. The white adipocytes from the transgenic mice were massively enlarged and contained excess triglyceride. The brown adipocytes contained large unilocular lipid droplets that produced a histologic appearance resembling mature white adipocytes. Isolated adipocytes from aP2-nSREBP-1a mice manifested significantly increased rates of fatty acid synthesis, which were associated with increased fatty acid secretion into the medium. In vivo, this led to a higher influx of free fatty acids (FFAs) from adipose tissues into liver, resulting in a fatty liver.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Materials and Methods—DNA manipulations were performed using standard molecular techniques (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). [9,10-3H]Oleic acid and [stearoyl-1-14C]stearoyl-CoA were purchased from American Radio-labeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and potassium [1-14C]palmitate was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals used were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The plasma concentration of cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and free fatty acids and the contents of liver cholesterol and triglyceride were measured as described previously (1Shimomura I.

A plasmid containing 5.4 kb of the aP2 gene promoter in pBluescript II SK(+) (designated paP2-Pro) was a generous gift from Dr. B. M. Spiegelman. A 1.5-kb EcoRI-SalI cDNA fragment of human SREBP-1a encoding amino acids 1–460 was excised from the pPEPCK-SREBP-1a460 plasmid (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and ligated into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the pCMV5 vector. 2D. W. Russell, unpublished construct. The resulting plasmid was designated pCMV5-SREBP-1a460. A 1.7-kb EcoRI-SphI fragment containing SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–460) and a 3′-polyadenylation signal were excised from pCMV5-SREBP-1a460 and blunted using DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment). The resulting fragment was designated SREBP-1a460-poly(A). SREBP-1a460-poly(A) was subcloned into the SmaI site of paP2-Pro to yield the final plasmid designated paP2-SREBP-1a460. The integrity of this plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Techniques used for generating transgenic mice were as described previously (18Hofmann S.L. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hammer R.E. Science. 1988; 239: 1277-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A 7.1-kb NotI-ClaI fragment containing the aP2 promoter, SREBP-1a460, and poly (A+) tail from paP2-SREBP-1a460 was gel-purified as described (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). A total of 613 fertilized eggs were microinjected with the aP2-SREBP-1a construct and survived to the two-cell stage. Among the 74 offspring, 19 (26%) had integrated the transgene as determined by dot-blot hybridization of DNA from tail homogenates. Of 19 founder mice subjected to partial lipectomy, 10 (53%) expressed the human SREBP-1a transcript as determined by Northern blotting (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Mice with high levels of expression were bred to (C57BL/6J × SJL)F1 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), and four independent transgenic lines were established. The transgenic lines were designated aP2-nSREBP-1a lines A, B, C, and D for lines 854-3, 951-4, 855-3, and 852-3 in order of the relative transgene mRNA expression in WAT from highest to lowest. All mice were housed in colony cages, maintained on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle, and fed Teklad mouse/rat diet 7002 from Harlan Teklad Premier Laboratory Diets (Madison, WI).Immunoblot Analysis—Nuclear extracts and membrane fractions were prepared from mouse livers and adipose tissue as described previously (19Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of mouse SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 was carried out exactly as described previously (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

For Northern gel analysis, equal aliquots of total RNA made from adipose tissue from each mouse listed in Table I (line A) were pooled (total, 10 μg), subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization conditions and cDNA probe preparations were carried out as described (1Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). The resulting bands were quantified by exposing the filter to a BAS 1000 Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). The -fold change was calculated after the signal was normalized to the signal generated by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Table IPhenotypic comparison of wild-type and aP2-nSREBP-1a miceLine ALine BParameter5-Week-old10-Week-old4-Week-oldWild-typeTransgenicWild-typeTransgenicWild-typeTransgenicSex5 males5 males6 males8 males4 males4 malesBody weight (g)19.4 ± 0.420.1 ± 1.323.7 ± 0.825.4 ± 1.217.2 ± 0.318.4 ± 0.9Liver weight (g)1.3 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.1ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).1.4 ± 0.072.2 ± 0.18ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).0.88 ± 0.071.32 ± 0.03Epididymal fat weight (g)0.13 ± 0.020.13 ± 0.020.22 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.03bp < 0.05 (Student's t test).0.086 ± 0.0120.096 ± 0.010Brown fat weight (g)0.042 ± 0.0100.149 ± 0.0200.054 ± 0.0040.240 ± 0.0470.049 ± 0.0070.147 ± 0.008ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).Liver cholesterol content (mg/g)2.3 ± 0.072.1 ± 0.061.9 ± 0.031.9 ± 0.082.4 ± 0.202.5 ± 0.10Liver triglyceride content (mg/g)8.4 ± 0.5516.2 ± 1.2ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).4.2 ± 0.610.5 ± 0.4ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).7.3 ± 0.5012.5 ± 1.1ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).Plasma cholesterol (mg/dl)80 ± 566 ± 583 ± 2.279 ± 3.792 ± 1187 ± 7Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)199 ± 32178 ± 22158 ± 25148 ± 20127 ± 29149 ± 13Plasma insulin (ng/ml)1.1 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.33.2 ± 1.20.7 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.3Plasma glucose (mg/dl)148 ± 13153 ± 11164 ± 19155 ± 18139 ± 23151 ± 19Plasma FFA (mm)752 ± 1021320 ± 159ap < 0.001 (Student's t test).602 ± 1361096 ± 161bp < 0.05 (Student's t test).686 ± 1061042 ± 141bp < 0.05 (Student's t test).a p < 0.001 (Student's t test).b p < 0.05 (Student's t test). Open table in a new tab RNase Protection Assay—RNase protection assays for preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) and mouse tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were done using the cDNA template described previously (1Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Ikemoto S. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3182-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Antisense cRNA was transcribed with [α-32P]CTP (20 mCi/ml) using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). The specific activities of the transcribed RNAs were measured in each experiment and were in the range of 1.7–2.6 × 109 cpm/μg for all RNAs except for β-actin RNA, which was 5.3–8.1 × 108 cpm/μg. Aliquots of total RNA (20 μg) from each sample were subjected to the RNase protection assay using a HybSpeed™ RPA kit (Ambion Inc.). Each assay tube contained a cRNA probe for the mRNA to be tested plus a cRNA probe complementary to the mRNA of β-actin. In preparing the probes, we adjusted the specific activity of [α-32P]CTP to give a β-actin signal comparable to the test mRNAs. After RNase A/T1 digestion, protected fragments were separated on 8 m urea and 4.8% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography using reflection film and intensifying screens (DuPont). The dried gels were also analyzed quantitatively with a Bio Imaging Analyzer using BAS 1000 MacBAS software (Fuji Medical Systems). The level of β-actin mRNA in each RNA sample was used to normalize signals obtained for the test mRNAs.Acyl-CoA Synthetase and Stearoyl-CoA Activity Measurements— Liver acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured in 8-week-old nonfasted male mice (five wild-type and five aP2-nSREBP-1a, line A) during the early light cycle. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured as described (22Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1971; 122: 353-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the tissues were washed with 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, and the adventitia was carefully removed. The tissues were then minced, homogenized with 10 volumes of 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. Five μg of protein from the supernatant was added to a reaction mixture that contained 150 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm MgCl2,20mm ATP, 200 mm potassium [1-14C]palmitate (56 mCi/mmol), 200 mm CoASH, and 2.25 mm glutathione in a total volume of 250 μl. This mixture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol, heptane, and 1 n H2SO4 (40:10:1). Following thorough mixing, 0.35 ml of water and 0.6 ml of heptane were added and mixed by shaking for 5 min. The upper organic phase was removed and discarded. The lower water phase was washed twice with 0.6 ml of heptane, and the radioactivity in 0.7 ml of the lower phase was counted. Hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity was measured in 8-week-old non-fasted male mice (seven wild-type and six aP2-nSREBP-1a, line A) during the early light cycle as described previously (21Shimomura I.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Primary Adipocytes—Adipocytes were prepared and pooled from epididymal and brown fat pads from four 12-week-old male wild-type and four aP2-nSREBP-1a line A littermate mice. Fat depots were resected under aseptic conditions, and adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion according to the procedure of Rodbell (23Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described below. The fat pads were minced in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mmd-glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin, 135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2·2H2O, 1.25 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 0.45 mm KH2PO4, 2.17 mm Na2HPO4, and 10 mm HEPES. Adipose tissue fragments were digested in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer with 1.25 mg/ml rat type II collagenase at 37° C with gentle shaking at 60 cycles/min for 45 min. The resultant cell suspension was diluted in 13 ml of cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. Isolated adipocytes were separated from undigested tissue by filtration through four layers of cheesecloth and washed three times with cold Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer. For washing, cells were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The final wash was with 13 ml of the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum). Floating cells were collected as primary adipocytes, plated on 60-mm collagen-treated dishes (catalog no. 40416, BD Biosciences), and cultured at 37 °C in 9% CO2. Adipocytes were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, and 0.5 mm sodium [14C]acetate (18 dpm/pmol) for 5 h. Incorporation of [14C]acetate into fatty acids and cholesterol was determined as described previously (8Pai J.-t. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The data are expressed as nanomoles of [14C]acetate incorporated into fatty acids and picomoles of [14C]acetate incorporated into cholesterol per μg of cellular DNA.RESULTSUnregulated overexpression of nSREBP-1a exclusively in adipose tissue was achieved by the construction of a transgene encoding only the transcriptionally active fragment of human SREBP-1a driven by the adipose-specific enhancer/promoter of the aP2 gene (24Ross S.R. Graves R.A. Greenstein A. Platt K.A. Shyu H.-L. Mellovitz B. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9590-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The truncated SREBP-1a transgene product terminates prior to the membrane attachment domain and therefore enters the nucleus directly without a requirement for proteolysis (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar).We studied four lines of transgenic mice that were derived from independent founders (lines A–D). Fig. 1A shows the results from Northern blot analysis of mRNA derived from the aP2-nSREBP-1a transgene in line A mice, confirming that the transgene mRNA was expressed abundantly in both WAT and BAT. The transgene mRNA levels in WAT from lines B–D were 70, 35, and 30% of that measured in line A (data not shown). By Northern blotting, there was no evidence of transgene mRNA expression in liver (Fig. 1A) or in brain, spleen, and kidney (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, transgenic aP2nSREBP-1a line A mice had abundant nSREBP-1a protein expressed in adipose tissue.Phenotypic Parameters in aP2-nSREBP-1a Mice— Table I lists the relevant phenotypic parameters measured in aP2nSREBP-1a mice (lines A and B) and their respective wild-type littermates. The most profound abnormalities were in aP2nSREBP-1a line A mice. Similar but less profound changes were observed in the line B mice, which expressed lower levels of nSREBP-1a. The significant abnormalities noted in aP2nSREBP-1a mice were as follows: 1) enlarged livers, 2) elevated hepatic triglyceride content, 3) enlarged interscapular brown fat pads, and 4) increased concentration of plasma FFAs. Plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, and glucose were not significantly altered. Of note, the epididymal fat pad weights were not significantly different from those in wild-type littermates.Histologic Changes in Fat of Transgenic Mice—The histology of WAT and BAT from representative wild-type and aP2nSREBP-1a line A mice is shown in Fig. 2. The epididymal fat pad from a 40-day-old wild-type mouse had mature adipocytes of uniform size containing unilocular fat droplets (Fig. 2A). The epididymal fat pad from a 40-day-old transgenic littermate mouse also showed mature adipocytes with distinct unilocular vacuoles; however, a small percentage of adipocytes were significantly larger than the wild-type adipocytes (Fig. 2B). This phenotype became more prominent as the mice aged. Fig. 2C shows WAT from a 70-day-old transgenic mouse. The diameter of most adipocytes from aP2-nSREBP-1a mice was markedly greater than that of adipocytes from wild-type mice. Many fat pads from mice of this age also showed an inflammatory response, characterized by a monocytic infiltration.Fig. 2Representative histologic sections of WAT and BAT. A and B, epididymal fat pads from 40-day-old wild-type and transgenic aP2-nSREBP-1a line A littermate mice, respectively; C, epididymal fat pad from a 70-day-old transgenic aP2-nSREBP-1a line A mouse; D and E, interscapular brown fat pads from 40-day-old wild-type and transgenic littermate mice, respectively. Note that the adipocytes of the white and brown fat pads from the transgenic mice were markedly enlarged (hematoxylin and eosin stain; magnification ×112).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Equally dramatic histologic changes were observed in BAT from aP2-nSREBP-1a mice. BAT from a 40-day-old wild-type mouse consisted of small multilocular adipocytes, as shown in Fig. 2D. In contrast, most adipocytes in BAT from aP2nSREBP-1a mice were markedly enlarged and contained predominantly unilocular fat droplets. This resulted in a histologic appearance similar to that of normal WAT (Fig. 2E).Expression of mRNAs for Target Genes in Fat— Fig. 3 shows multiple Northern blots measuring mRNAs for genes encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis in WAT (Fig. 3A) and BAT (Fig. 3B) from wild-type and aP2nSREBP-1a line A mice. Significant increases were measured in the mRNAs for the low density lipoprotein receptor as well as enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis in WAT and BAT from transgenic mice. In particular, the mRNA encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a rate-controlling enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, was increased by >20-fold in WAT and BAT. The mRNAs for the fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthetic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1, fatty-acid synthase, and"

In this study, ceramide-1-phosphate (C-1-P) was shown to be a specific and potent inducer of arachidonic acid (AA) and prostanoid synthesis in cells. This study also demonstrates that two well established activators of AA release and prostanoid synthesis, the cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and the calcium ionophore, A23187, induce an increase in C-1-P levels within the relevant time-frame of AA release. Furthermore, the enzyme responsible for the production of C-1-P in mammalian cells, ceramide kinase, was activated in response to IL-1β and A23187. RNA interference targeted to ceramide kinase specifically down-regulated ceramide kinase mRNA and activity with a concomitant decrease of AA release in response to IL-1β and A23187. Down-regulation of ceramide kinase had no effect on AA release induced by exogenous C-1-P. Collectively, these results indicate that ceramide kinase, via the formation of C-1-P, is an upstream modulator of phospholipase A2 activation. This study identifies previously unknown roles for ceramide kinase and its product, C-1-P, in AA release and production of eicosanoids and provides clues for potential new targets to block inflammatory responses.

The production of AA is the initial rate-limiting step in eicosanoid biosynthesis; thus, the regulation of phospholipases, specifically phospholipase A2, is of key importance in this pathway (1Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 2Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). At the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane, PLA2 hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to produce AA, beginning eicosanoid biosynthesis (1Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 2Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The AA produced is utilized by either lipoxygenases to produce leukotrienes or by cyclooxygenases (COXs) to produce prostanoids (1Clark J.D. Schievella A.R. Nalefski E.A. Lin L.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 2Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The COX-2 pathway of prostanoid synthesis has been established as an important therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disorders (3Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been found that inhibitors of COX-2 reduce the growth and metastasis capabilities of some cancers. Specifically, in mouse models of familial adenomatous polyposis, it has been shown that crosses with knockout mice of either cytosolic phospholipase A2 or COX-2 reduced the size and metastatic capability of tumors (4Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M. Cell. 1996; 87: 803-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 5Takaku K.

Hasegawa H. Nishibori H. Ishii Y. Tatematsu H. Yamamoto K. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar). However, despite the value of COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of disease states, inhibition of COX-2 is unable to reduce AA release that may lead to excess production of leukotrienes and thromboxanes and, thus, side effects. In addition, AA production leads to glutathione depletion and reactive oxygen species generation. For these reasons, PLA2 as an earlier therapeutic target in the pathway of eicosanoid production is of increased importance. Consequently, identification of components in the pathways proximal to PLA2 activation is of key importance and high priority. The main component of the venom from Loxosceles reclusus (brown recluse spider) is the enzyme sphingomyelinase D (SMase D) (7Kurpiewski G. Forrester L.J. Barrett J.T. Campbell B.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 678: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to produce ceramide-1-phosphate (C-1-P). The pathology of a wound generated from the bite of this spider consists of an intense inflammatory response mediated by AA and prostaglandins (8Carbonaro P.A. Janniger C.K. Schwartz R.A. Cutis. 1995; 56: 256-259PubMed Google Scholar, 9Arnold R.E. Jacep. 1976; 5: 262-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Rees R.S. Gates C. Timmons S. Des Prez R.M. King Jr., L.E. Toxicology. 1988; 26: 1035-1045Google Scholar). The production of endogenous C-1-P by the action of SMase D raised the intriguing possibility that C-1-P may act as an endogenous and proximal activator of PLA2 and the subsequent inflammatory response, mediated by prostaglandins. In this study C-1-P was found to be a potent and specific inducer of AA release and prostanoid synthesis in cells. This study further demonstrates that the activation of the enzyme that produces C-1-P in mammalian cells, ceramide kinase, is necessary for AA release and prostanoid synthesis in response to agonists. Thus, for the first time, a specific biology for the C-1-P and the enzyme that generates it, ceramide kinase, is demonstrated. Furthermore, this study also identifies a missing link in the induction of AA liberation in response to agonists. Cell Culture—A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells (epithelial-derived) were grown in low glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 200 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained under 80% confluency and standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere, 95% air, 5% CO2, 37 °C). For treatment, cells were incubated for2hinlow glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine, 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 200 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 200 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate before the addition of agonist. Quantification of Arachidonic Acid Release—A549 cells (5 × 104) were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml [3H]AA (5 nm) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. After treatment, medium was transferred to 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes and centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and [3H]AA cpm was determined by scintillation counting. Results were controlled for an equivalent number of cells quantified by MTT assay as described (11Chalfant C.E. Rathman K. Pinkerman R.L. Wood R.E. Obeid L.M. Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12587-12595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and by verification of total AA labeling by scintillation counting. For the experiments in Fig. 4, purified SMase D was obtained from Dr. Alfred H. Merrill, Jr., and SMase C (purified from Bacillus cereus) was obtained commercially from Sigma. Quantification of Prostaglandin E2 and Thromboxane B2 Synthesis— For measurement of PGE2 and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) levels, aliquots of media were taken at the indicated time points and assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2 monoclonal EIA kit from Cayman Chemical. Briefly, media containing PGE2 or TXB2 compete with PGE2 or TXB2 acetylcholinesterase conjugate for a limited amount of monoclonal antibody. The antibody-PGE2 or -TXB2 conjugate binds to a goat-anti-mouse antibody previously attached to the 96-well plate. The plate is washed to remove unbound reagents, and then the substrate for acetylcholinesterase is provided. The concentration of each prostanoid in a sample is inversely proportional to the yellow color produced. Results were controlled for an equivalent number of cells quantified by the MTT assay. Quantification of Ceramide-1-Phosphate Levels by Pulse-labeling with D-e-C6 NBD-ceramide—Two hours before Bligh-Dyer extraction, cells were chased with 20 μm D-e-C6 NBD-ceramide (Matreya). At the appropriate times, lipids were extracted by the Bligh-Dyer method and analyzed for NBD-C-1-P formation using TLC analysis, and the results were normalized to total lipid phosphate as described (12Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramide Kinase Assay—Ceramide kinase activity was measured as described previously with slight modifications (13Bajjalieh S. Batchelor R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 311: 207-215Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were treated with A23187 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min or IL-1β (2.5 ng/ml) for 3.5 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (ice-cold), and resuspended in a 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were disrupted by two 15-s pulses with a Fisher 550 Sonic Dismembranator at setting 2. Each sample (10 μg) was assayed for ceramide kinase activity by incubation with NBD-C12 ceramide/cardiolipin/β-octylglucoside and 500 μm ATP in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 30 °C. After Bligh-Dyer extraction, lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography, and NBD-C-1-P was visualized/quantified by fluorescent phosphorimaging. RNAi Design and Transfections—Knock-downs of ceramide kinase were performed essentially as described using sequence-specific small RNAi reagents (14Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and the human ceramide kinase RNAi starting 142 nucleotides from start codon (UGCCUGCUCUGUGCCUGUAdTdT and UACAGGCACAGAGCAGGCAdTdT). All sequences were evaluated against the data base using the NIH blast program to test for specificity (Xeragon, a Qiagen company). A549 cells (3 × 104) were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. After the 4-h transfection, cells were treated and assayed for AA release or PGE2 synthesis at 26 h post-transfection. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—For evaluating the levels of ceramide kinase mRNA and ribosomal 18 S RNA, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) as the priming agent. After a 1-h incubation at 43.5 °C, the reactions were stopped by 70 °C heating for 15 min. Template RNA was then removed using RNase H (Invitrogen). For evaluating ceramide kinase expression, an upstream 5′ primer to ceramide kinase (5′-TCGTCTGTGTCGGCGGAGAT-3′) and a downstream 3′ primer (3′-GCAAGACCCAACCACCGTTTC-5′) were designed to amplify ceramide kinase mRNA crossing at least one exon/intron boundary to eliminate the possibility of amplifying genomic DNA. Using these primers 10% of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified for 15 cycles (94 °C, 30s; 58 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min) using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). For ribosomal 18 S RNA, primers were obtained from Clontech Laboratories, and RNA was amplified for 10 cycles following the standard protocol provided by the company. Natural and Endogenous Ceramide-1-Phosphate Is a Potent and Specific Inducer of AA Release and Prostaglandin Synthesis in Cells—Treatment of A549 cells with d-erythro-C16 ceramide-1-phosphate (2.5 μm), a naturally occurring sphingolipid, induced an increase in AA release within minutes of treatment, with a maximal early increase of ∼2-fold after 20 min followed by reuptake and a sustained increase in AA release after 1 h (Fig. 1, panels A and B). Increased PGE2 synthesis was observed only after 1 h, corresponding with the sustained increase in AA liberation (Fig. 1, panels C and D). This effect of C-1-P on AA release and PGE2 synthesis was dose-responsive with an EC50 of 400 nm with a concentration as low as 100 nm, inducing a significant increase in AA release (Fig. 2, panels A and B). Therefore, C-1-P induces a time- and dose-dependent increase in both AA and PGE2 release.Fig. 2The effects of ceramide-1-phosphate on AA release (panel A) and PGE2 synthesis (panel B) are dose-dependent. As described in Fig. 1, A549 cells (5 × 104) were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (5 nm). Cells were washed and placed in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. Cells were treated with various concentrations of D-e-C16 ceramide-1-phosphate for 8 h. The results are presented as dpm of [3H]arachidonic acid/ml for an equivalent number of cells by MTT assay. In parallel experiments, PGE2 synthesis was assayed, and results are presented as pg of PGE2/ml of media controlled for an equivalent number of cells by MTT assay. Data are representative of six separate determinations on three separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because C-1-P stimulated AA release, the production of the COX-1 product, TXB2, was also examined after C-1-P treatment (note: A549 cells do not express lipoxygenases or cytochrome P450 (15Brinckmann R. Topp M.S. Zalan I. Heydeck D. Ludwig P. Kuhn H. Berdel W.E. Habenicht J.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Yamane M. Abe A.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 128: 827-835Google Scholar)). C-1-P (1 μm) also dramatically increased TXB2 by 2.5-fold after 2 h and 11-fold after 4 h (Fig. 3, panel A), suggesting that C-1-P induces the activation of a PLA2 species upstream of cyclooxygenases. This was further demonstrated by using L929 fibroblasts that do not express COX-2. In these cells, PGE2 synthesis/release was not observed in response to C-1-P (Fig. 3, panel B), but significant AA release of 225% over basal release was detected after 1 h of C-1-P treatment (1 μm) (Fig. 3, panel B). Therefore, C-1-P induces a time- and dose-dependent increase in both AA and PGE2 release in A549 cells that express high levels of COX-2, but is specific for AA release, as COX-1 products are produced and cells lacking COX-2 do not produce PGE2 in response to C-1-P. Furthermore, C-1-P had no effect on the expression of COX-2 as judged by Western immunoblotting (data not shown). To examine whether the effect of C-1-P on AA synthesis was specific, A549 cells were treated with closely related lipids, dioleoylphosphatidic acid (PA), dioleoylglycerol (DAG), d-erythro-sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P), and d-erythro-C16 ceramide (CER), for 2 h. Only C-1-P induced significant AA release (Fig. 4, panel A). Because d-erythro-C16 ceramide induced a small increase in AA release, we examined the effects of long term treatment of d-erythro-C16 ceramide and C-1-P. Unlike C-1-P, d-erythro-C16 ceramide showed no further increase in AA release (Fig. 4, panel B). Thus, the effect of C-1-P on AA release in cells is lipid-specific. To determine whether endogenously produced C-1-P can induce AA release, A549 cells were treated with SMase D, which hydrolyzes membrane sphingomyelin (SM) to generate C-1-P (data not shown). SMase D treatment resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in AA release (Fig. 4, panel C). To demonstrate that the enhancement of AA release was a specific effect of C-1-P generation in response to SMase D, A549 cells were treated with SMase C, which hydrolyzes membrane SM to generate ceramide directly (data not shown) and remove the substrate for SMase D (Fig. 4, panel C) (17Feldhaus M.J. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4285-4293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SMase C alone only induced modest AA release, which could be the result of the action of ceramide or further conversion to C-1-P (18Modur V. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13094-13102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Importantly, pre-treatment with SMase C inhibited AA release in response to SMase D (Fig. 4, panel C), demonstrating that SM is required for the action of SMase D and that C-1-P is the primary product of SM hydrolysis responsible for the action of SMase D on AA release. Thus, C-1-P is a potent effector of AA release in A549 cells, and more importantly, generation of endogenous C-1-P can induce significant AA release. The Generation of Endogenous Ceramide-1-Phosphate and Activation of Ceramide Kinase Coincides with AA Release in response to IL-1β and A23187—If C-1-P functions as a signaling molecule in the pathway to AA release and eicosanoid synthesis, then an increase in the levels of C-1-P should be observed before or coinciding with AA release in response to agonists. The cytokine, IL-1β, and the calcium ionophore, A23187, are potent and well established inducers of AA release (19Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Perisic O. Paterson H.F. Mosedale G. Lara-Gonzalez S. Williams R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14979-14987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). IL-1β began to increase AA release after 3.5–4 h of treatment in A549 cells, whereas A23187 increased AA release within minutes (Fig. 5, panels A and B). Using pulse labeling with NBD-D-e-C6 ceramide, it was found that IL-1β invoked a significant increase of 242% in C-1-P levels after 4 h (Fig. 5, panel A). A23187 invoked a significant increase in C-1-P levels within 5 min of treatment, reaching a maximal increase in C-1-P levels of ∼4-fold after 10 min (Fig. 5, panel B). Thus, IL-1β and A23187 increase C-1-P levels within the relevant time frame of AA release. Little is known about the biosynthesis of C-1-P in vivo. C-1-P could be generated through either the action of a SMase D-type enzyme or ceramide kinase. Mammalian cells are known to contain ceramide kinase activity, which has been recently identified by molecular cloning (21Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); however, no mammalian SMase D-like activity has been described or identified. Moreover, the preceding results on the generation of C-1-P are more consistent with the activation of ceramide kinase, since treatment with agonists enhanced the phosphorylation of NBD-ceramide to NBD-C-1-P. Therefore, we examined the activation and the role of ceramide kinase in agonist-induced prostanoid synthesis. Treatment of cells with IL-1β (3.5 h) or A23187 (5 min) increased ceramide kinase activity by 187 and 216%, respectively (Fig. 5, panel C). Thus, known agonists of AA liberation also activate ceramide kinase within the relevant time frame of AA release. Down-regulation of Ceramide Kinase Using RNAi Technology Inhibits AA Release and PGE2 Synthesis in Response to IL-1β and A23187—To demonstrate a role for endogenous ceramide kinase in regulating PLA2 activation/AA release in response to agonists, we used RNAi technology to specifically down-regulate ceramide kinase (14Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). RNAi specifically decreased the mRNA levels of ceramide kinase by 73%, and endogenous ceramide kinase activity was decreased 67% without effects on cell number (Fig. 6). Mock transfection and transfection of control (scrambled) RNAi had no effect on the mRNA levels or the activity of ceramide kinase (data not shown). Although ceramide kinase was cloned because of its similarity to sphingosine kinase 1 (21Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), there was no decrease in immunoreactive levels of sphingosine kinase-1 observed with RNAi targeted to ceramide kinase (data not shown). Importantly, down-regulation of ceramide kinase by RNAi inhibited AA release in response to A23187 by 72% and AA release in response to IL-1β by 78%. When normalized to the down-regulation of ceramide kinase activity and mRNA expression induced by RNAi, this is equivalent to a complete abolishment of AA liberation in response to these agonists. This effect of ceramide kinase RNAi was also dose-responsive, with an IC50 of ∼30 nm, indicating the high potency of the action of RNAi (Fig. 7, panels A–C). Furthermore, ceramide kinase RNAi also inhibited PGE2 synthesis in response to IL-1β and A23187 to the same extent in A549 cells (data not shown). In another cell type, L929 fibroblasts, AA release, and PGE2 synthesis in response to IL-1β were also inhibited more than 60% by RNAi targeted to ceramide kinase (data not shown). Ceramide kinase RNAi did not affect the distal “machinery” of PLA2 activation/AA release as transfection of ceramide kinase RNAi had no effect on AA release in response to C-1-P treatment (Fig. 7, panel D). Thus, ceramide kinase is a necessary enzyme in the induction of AA liberation in response to cytokines and calcium-mobilizing agonists in cells.Fig. 7Ceramide kinase regulates AA release in response to IL-1β and calcium ionophore. Panel A, the effect of ceramide kinase RNAi on AA release in response to IL-1β. A549 cells (5 × 104) were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes for ceramide kinase or scrambled control sequence. After the 4-h transfection, cells were incubated overnight. Cells were washed and placed in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 2 h. After 26 h post-transfection, cells were treated with IL-1β (2.5 ng/ml).

Data are representative of six separate determinations on three separate occasions. Panel B, the effect of ceramide kinase RNAi on AA release in response to 5 min of treatment with A23187. A549 cells (5 × 104) were transfected with the 21-nucleotide duplexes for ceramide kinase or scrambled control sequence. After the 4 h transfection, cells were labeled overnight with 5 μCi/ml [3H]arachidonic acid (5 nm). Cells were washed and placed in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for two h. After 26 h post-transfection, cells were treated with A23187 (1 μg/ml) for 5 min and assayed for AA release. Data are presented as AA release (dpm) for control RNAi plus vehicle (▪), ceramide kinase RNAi plus vehicle (•), control RNAi plus A23187 (1 μg/ml) (▴), and ceramide kinase RNAi plus A23187 (1 μg/ml) (•). Data are representative of six separate determinations on three separate occasions. Panel C, the effect of ceramide kinase RNAi on AA release in response to 30 min of treatment with A23187. Following the same procedure as outlined in panel B for ceramide kinase RNAi, cells were treated with A23187 (1 μg/ml) for 30 min and assayed for AA release. Data are presented as AA release (dpm) for control RNAi plus vehicle (▪), ceramide kinase RNAi plus vehicle (•), control RNAi plus A23187 (1 μg/ml) (▴), and ceramide kinase RNAi plus A23187 (1 μg/ml) (•). Data are representative of six separate determinations on three separate occasions. Panel D, C-1-P overcomes the inhibition of ceramide kinase RNAi on AA release. Following the same procedure as outlined in panel B, cells transfected with control RNAi (Control) and ceramide kinase RNAi (CerK RNAi) were treated with C-1-P (2.5 μm) for 5 h, and AA release (dpm) was measured. Data are representative of three separate determinations on two separate occasionsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that C-1-P is a potent modulator of AA release and PGE2 production. Furthermore, endogenous C-1-P and the enzyme that generates C-1-P, ceramide kinase, were necessary for PLA2 activation in response to cytokines and calcium ionophore. Thus, a specific biology has been established for C-1-P, and for the first time a physiological role for ceramide kinase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of C-1-P, has been determined. Moreover, our results show ceramide kinase to be a potentially important regulatory component of inflammatory responses because AA release is crucial for its conversion to eicosanoids. Therefore, ceramide kinase and C-1-P have been established as new “players” proximal to the liberation of AA. The sphingomyelin-derived metabolites, ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate are emerging as an important class of bioactive lipid mediators. Although the metabolite of ceramide, C-1-P, was identified more than a decade ago (22Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol.

(30Rile G. Yatomi Y. Takafuta T. Ozaki Y. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 2003; 109: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) reported that C-1-P levels were not increased in response to cell stimulation in neutrophils. Therefore, a biological role for ceramide kinase in the phagocytosis pathway of neutrophils remains to be defined. This study convincingly establishes a biological role for C-1-P as a proximal mediator of AA liberation and adds it to a growing list of bioactive sphingolipid metabolites. In contrast to previous reports on C-1-P, this study demonstrates that C-1-P induces a biological effect (liberation of AA) in the nanomolar range, and the generation of endogenous C-1-P by the action of SMase D alone was sufficient to elicit this biological response in cells. Furthermore, the recent cloning of ceramide kinase (21Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) allowed for the specific down-regulation of the enzyme using RNAi technology, and thus, for the first time a biological role for ceramide kinase has been established. Therefore, the product of ceramide kinase, C-1-P, fulfills several of the following key criteria of a bioactive lipid. First, C-1-P levels are regulated in response to agonists. Second, exogenous C-1-P induces a specific biochemical and cellular response (release of AA), and this action of C-1-P demonstrates lipid specificity. Third, endogenous C-1-P reproduces these effects specifically. Last, the generation of C-1-P is required for AA release in response to inflammatory agonists. Because the presented study has identified C-1-P as a new messenger lipid in biological systems, the search for a direct intracellular target of C-1-P is now warranted. Previous reports of sphingolipids regulating inflammatory responses give insight into a possible intracellular target of C-1-P. Klapisz et al. (32Klapisz E. Masliah J. Bereziat G. Wolf C. Koumanov K.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1680-1688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that SMase C and exogenous ceramide enhanced activation of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) in response to A23187, suggesting that ceramide might enhance calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2 to membranes. Sato and co-workers (33Kitatani K. Oka T. Murata T. Hayama M. Akiba S. Sato T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) then reported that both ceramide and SMase C treatment did indeed enhance calcium-dependent translocation of cPLA2. Because ceramide and SMase C alone did not elicit an increase in cPLA2 translocation in these reports, conversion of ceramide to C-1-P in response to A23187 may explain these early findings and suggests cPLA2 as a possible intracellular target of C-1-P. In this regard, we demonstrated that A23187 induces the activation of ceramide kinase and the accumulation of C-1-P, and because this study shows that C-1-P is the actual mediator of AA liberation, the conversion of ceramide to C-1-P is a likely explanation of the synergism observed between ceramide generation and enhanced cPLA2 activation. Interestingly, ceramide kinase is a Ca2+-dependent enzyme like cPLA2 (13Bajjalieh S. Batchelor R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 311: 207-215Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Reynolds L.J. Hughes L.L.

Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). This, therefore, correlates well with the report demonstrating that C-1-P treatment activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (31Carpio L.C. Stephan E. Kamer A. Dziak R. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 1999; 61: 267-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of serine-threonine protein phosphatases, okadaic acid, has also been shown to induce AA release via cPLA2 in a calcium-independent manner, possibly through effects on the phospho-state of the enzyme (42de Carvalho M.G. McCormack A.L. Olson E. Ghomashchi F. Gelb M.H. Yates J.R. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6987-6997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid may be an artificial means of mimicking the intracellular role of endogenously generated C-1-P since unpublished findings from our laboratory demonstrate that C-1-P is a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 50 nm) of protein phosphatase-1 and protein phosphatase 2A. Thus, the generation of C-1-P may act indirectly to induce/enhance the phosphorylation of Ser-505 and Ser-727 of cPLA2 by inhibiting protein phosphatases and simultaneous activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. A role for ceramide kinase and C-1-P in cPLA2 activation may also have implications in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate-dependent activation of cPLA2 since the recent cloning of ceramide kinase identified a PH domain in its N terminus (21Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar); thus, one can hypothesize that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphophate may activate ceramide kinase through its PH domain, generating C-1-P and eliciting cPLA2 activation indirectly, as alluded to above. Based on the results of this study, a pathophysiologic link can now be inferred between the production of C-1-P and inflammatory responses mediated by AA and prostaglandins observed from the bite of a brown recluse spider. C-1-P may also play a role in the reported link between PGE2, neurotransmitters, and airway epithelial inflammation since the highest levels of C-1-P are found in synaptic vesicles (13Bajjalieh S. Batchelor R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 311: 207-215Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Bajjalieh S.M. Martin T.F. Floor E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14354-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence for ceramide kinase and C-1-P as major regulators/inducers of inflammatory responses and may have implications in the development of therapeutics for inflammatory disorders.

https://openalex.org/W1967477749,"Lats2 is a new member of the Lats tumor suppressor family. The human LATS2 gene is located at chromosome 13q11-12, which has been shown to be a hot spot (67%) for LOH in nonsmall cell lung cancer. In order to understand the function of LATS2 in the control of tumor development, we ectopically expressed mouse Lats2 via retroviral infection in NIH3T3/v-ras cells to examine whether Lats2 plays a role in suppressing tumor development and regulating cell proliferation. We have found that ectopic expression of Lats2 in NIH3T3/v-ras cells suppresses development of tumors in athymic nude mice and inhibits proliferation of NIH3T3/v-ras cells in an in vitro assay. Cell cycle profile analysis demonstrated that ectopic expression of Lats2 inhibited the G1/S transition. Further mechanistic studies revealed that cyclin E/CDK2 kinase activity was downregulated in Lats2-transduced NIH3T3/v-ras cells, while other cell cycle regulators controlling the G1/S transition were not affected. We have also shown that LATS2 kinase activity and two LATS conserved domains (LCDs) are required for Lats2 to suppress tumorigenicity and to inhibit cell growth. In addition, the LATS2 protein is cytoplasmic during interphase in NIH3T3 cells, while it becomes localized to the mitotic apparatus during mitosis. Finally, we propose a model in which a combination of mammalian Lats2 and Lats1 control cell proliferation by negatively regulating different cell cycle check points."

Here, we explored the possibility of cross-talk between HBx and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a potent transcriptional inducer of angiogenic factors. First, we showed that stability of HIF-1α protein was increased by HBx in HBx-inducible Chang liver cells as well as in transient HBx expression system of non-hepatic cells. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that the HBx-induced HIF-1α was partially translocated into the nucleus in majority of cells while additional CoCl2-induced hypoxic condition caused complete nuclear translocation. Second, HBx induced both phosphorylation of HIF-1α and activation of p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which were synergistically enhanced in the presence of CoCl2. Furthermore, HBx enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α in the reporter genes encoding hypoxia response element or VEGF promoter. Either treatment of MEK inhibitor PD98059 or coexpression of dominant-negative MAPK mutants abolished the HBx-induced transcriptional activity and protein stability as well as nuclear translocation of HIF-1α, suggesting that HBx activates HIF-1α through MAPK pathway. Third, the association of HIF-1α with von Hippel-Lindau was decreased but the association with CREB-binding protein was enhanced in the presence of HBx, suggesting the molecular mechanism by which HBx enhances the protein stability and transactivation function of HIF-1α. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of HIF-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor was increased in the liver of HBx-transgenic mice, suggesting that the cross-talk between HIF-1α and HBx may lead to transcriptional activation of HIF-1α target genes, which play a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis.

One of the open reading frames encoded by the HBV genome is a regulatory X protein (HBx), which is a multifunctional transactivator of 16.5 kDa that is required for the transcription of the viral genome (reviewed in Ref. 1Cromlish J.A. Trends. Microbiol. 1996; 4: 270-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HBx activates signal transduction cascades including the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, Src-dependent pathways, and Jak1 tyrosine kinase, thereby resulting in the activation of AP-1, NF-κB, and signal transducers and activators of transcriptions, the major transcriptional factors associated with the proliferation and differentiation signals of liver cells (reviewed in Ref. 2Diao J.

HBx protein also interacts with the tumor suppressor p53, resulting in a loss of the protein function (3Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The expression of VEGF is increased during exposure to hypoxia, and the hypoxia-mediated response depends on hypoxia-regulated element (HRE) sequences in the 5′ and 3′ regions of the VEGF gene that specifically bind to and are transcriptionally activated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) (9Levy A.P.

HIF-1 comprises α and β subunit, both of which belong to the basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (PER, ARNT, SIM) protein family. HIF-1β, the previously described ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator), can dimerize with several different basic helix-loop-helix-PAS proteins, whereas HIF-1α is the specific oxygen-regulated subunit. Although HIF-1β is quite stable in normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is extremely unstable and quickly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (11Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Eventually, HIF-1 activates the transcription of diverse genes encoding proteins that function to increase oxygen delivery such as erythropoietin to allow metabolic adaptation such as glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes and to promote cell survival such as insulin-like growth factor II in response to hypoxia (reviewed in Ref. 20Semenza G.L.

Up-regulation of HIF-1α was observed in a broad range of cancers including breast and prostate cancer, which was correlated well with increased vascularity and metastatic potential, indicating that the expression of HIF-1α is associated with tumor progression (21Zhong H.

Importantly, the expression of VEGF and new blood vessel formation were increased in the hepatocytes that stably express HBx (27Lee S.W. Lee Y.M. Bae S.K. Murakami S. Yun Y. Kim K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although HIF-1 is a major transcription factor known to regulate angiogenic factors such as VEGF and insulin-like growth factor II, the role of HBx in transcriptional function of HIF-1 has not been investigated. Therefore, in the present investigation, we explored the possibility of cross-talk between HBx and HIF-1α and showed for the first time that the HBx enhances transcriptional activity of HIF-1α probably through activation of MAPK pathway. Our results support the important role of HBx in angiogenesis and tumor progression in the HBV-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Cell Lines and Cell Culture—Chang (ATCC CCL 13) and Chang X-34 and Chang X-31 in which HBx gene expression is under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter were described previously (4Yun C.

Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 (ATCC HB 8065), human cervical carcinoma cell line, HeLa (ATCC CCL-2), and human embryonal kidney cell line 293 (ATCC CRL-1573) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of 5% CO2. Plasmids and Transient Transfection—The FLAG-tagged full-length HIF-1α was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified full-length HIF-1α fragment into the KpnI/BamHI site of p3XFLAG-7.1 (Sigma). The Myc-tagged HBx was constructed by inserting an EcoRI/KpnI fragment of pCMV-HA-HBx to the corresponding restriction sites of pCMV-Myc (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The Myc-tagged VHL was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified VHL fragment into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pCMV-Myc. All of the construction was confirmed by sequencing. For transient transfection, 293 (2 × 106 cells/dish) or HeLa cells (8 × 105 cells/dish) were seeded in 60-cm2 dishes and incubated overnight. The cells were transfected with 2-μg expression vectors using Polyfect® (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells/tissues were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors for 30 min on ice, and whole cell lysate was obtained by subsequent centrifugation. Fifty micrograms of protein from whole cell lysates was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE unless otherwise indicated and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Blocking was performed in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated with specific antibodies against HIF-1α, VEGF, hemagglutinin (HA), phosphorylated p42/p44, p42/p44, Myc, CBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), FLAG (Sigma), or α-tubulin (Oncogene, Boston, MA). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) were used, and immunoreactive proteins were detected using the Super Signal (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The protein concentration was quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of whole cell lysates were incubated with 2-μg anti-HIF-1α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.). The resulting immunocomplex was precipitated by adding 40 μl of protein A-agarose slurry. To precipitate FLAG-tagged HIF-1α, anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) was used. The resulting immunocomplex was washed five times with lysis buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with either anti-Myc or anti-CBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). PCR reaction was performed as described previously with specific primers for HIF-1α (forward, 5′-CAAGTGCATCATTAAGACTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGCTGCTCCAGGTCCTGGCG-3′); VEGF (forward, 5′-TGGAGTTTGCTAAACGTCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTAGCTTATCTACTTTTGTC-3′); HBx (forward, 5′-GCTCTAGAATGGCTGCTAGGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGGCAGAGGTG-3′); and β-actin (forward, 5′-CGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTGGCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′) (28Lee M.-O.

Genes were analyzed under the same conditions used to exponentially amplify the PCR products. Flow Cytometric Analysis for HIF-1α Expression—Cells were detached by trypsinization and washed twice with PBS containing 3% FBS. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS containing 3% FBS and resuspended in a permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min on ice. The cells then were stained with the anti-HIF-1α antibodies (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by secondary antibody consisting of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and streptavidin-fluorescein (1:200 dilution, Roche Applied Science). The fluorescent intensity of the stained cells was measured in a FACStar PLUS flow cytometer, and data were analyzed using the PC-Lysis software program (BC Biosciences). This procedure was carried out on normal rabbit IgG in parallel as a negative control. Immunocytochemistry—Chang and Chang X-34 cells (7.5 × 104 cells/chamber) that had been plated the previous day on a 4-chamber slide glass were treated with 100 μm CoCl2 or vehicle in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 50% acetone, 50% methanol for 5 min and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated in blocking solution of 3% FBS in PBS for 1 h and then stained with anti-HIF-1α antibody diluted into 1:100 in PBS containing 3% FBS overnight followed by a secondary antibody consisting of biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG diluted to 1:200 in PBS containing 3% FBS. Streptavidin-fluorescein (1:200 dilution) was used to visualize the stained cells by confocal microscopy (Nikon). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to stain nuclei. Reporter Gene Assays—The HRE-Luc containing four copies of the erythropoietin hypoxia-responsive element (i.e. 5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′), Gal4-tk-Luc containing Gal4 binding site, and the VEGF promoter (-2068 to +50)-Luc reporter constructs have been described elsewhere (17Hur E.

The eukaryotic expression vector for wild type HBx (HpSVX), the vector encoding frameshift mutant of HBx (pSVXkB), and the dominant negative mutants of p42 and p44, pERK1KR, and pERK2KR, respectively, were as described previously (17Hur E.

The eukaryotic expression vector encoding full-length HIF-1α and pGal4-HIF-1α containing the DNA binding domain (1-147 amino acids) of yeast Gal4 linked to the full-length coding region of mouse HIF-1α as described previously (17Hur E. Chang K.Y. Lee E. Lee S.K. Park H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in a 12-well culture plate and transfected with reporter plasmid (0.1 or 0.3 μg) and β-galactosidase expression vector (0.2 μg) in the presence or absence of HBx expression vector using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with 100 μm CoCl2 for 24 h and then lysed in the cell culture lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was determined using an analytical luminescence luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using the corresponding β-galactosidase activity. Animals and Immunohistochemistry—Transgenic mice carrying the HBx gene were maintained in a laboratory animal facility in the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine, Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine (Seoul, Korea) under specific pathogen free conditions (28Lee M.-O.

We used the HBx homozygote-transgenic mice at different ages and age-matched wild type controls, which were maintained in a barrier room under constant temperature (22 ± 2 °C) and humidity (55 ± 2%). Food (Purina diet) and water were supplied ad libitum. The experimental protocol was approved by the Committee for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at Yonsei University according to the Guide for Animal Experiments edited by Korean Academy for Medical Sciences. Mice were sacrificed under ether anesthesia, and the liver was removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Three portions of each liver tissue were embedded in paraplast. To visualize the expression of VEGF in liver tissue of the HBx-transgenic mice, a standard immunohistochemistry protocol was used as described previously (33Yoong K.F. Afford S.C. Randhawa S. Hubscher S.G. Adams D.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 693-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The primary antibody binding was localized by a mouse-anti-human VEGF antibody (1:100 Dilution) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight followed by treatment with anti-mouse IgG antibodies. Sections were incubated with an avidin-biotin complex conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. To better visualize the positive cells, color development was enhanced by diaminobenzidine and counter-stained by hematoxylin. HBx Increases Stability of HIF-1α Protein—Because the role of HBx is implicated in angiogenesis and metastasis during hepatocarcinogenesis, we examined whether HBx directly modulates the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, which is a critical inducer of tumor angiogenesis. Transcriptional activity of HIF-1α is primarily regulated by the accumulation of HIF-1α protein under hypoxic stress, which otherwise is rapidly degraded by ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in normoxic cell (11Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 12Kallio P.J. Wilson W.J. O'Brien S. Makino Y. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6519-6525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether HBx induced accumulation of HIF-1α. For this purpose, we employed the Chang X-34 cell line in which the expression of HBx gene is under control of an inducible doxycycline promoter (4Yun C. Lee J.H. Park H. Jin Y.M. Park S. Park K. Cho H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Lee M.-O. Choi Y. Shin E. Kang H. Kim Y. Jeong S. Seong J. Yu D. Cho H. Park J. Kim S. J.

Commun. 2001; 288: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After Chang X-34 cells were treated with doxycycline, the expression of HIF-1α was measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). When the HA-tagged HBx was stained with specific antibodies against HA, the protein was slightly detectable in the absence of doxycycline treatment, which probably represented leaky expression of HBx, being consistent with the previous reports (4Yun C. Lee J.H. Park H. Jin Y.M. Park S. Park K. Cho H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5163-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Yun C. Um H.R. Jin Y.H. Wang J.H. Lee M.-O. Park S. Lee J.H. Cho H. Cancer Lett. 2002; 184: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). With doxycycline, the expression of HA-HBx was significantly induced. When HBx was expressed at the lower level without doxycycline, the expression of HIF-1α was detected. When HBx was expressed at a higher level after doxycycline treatment, the amount of HIF-1α protein was increased. Consistent with the expression level of HIF-1α, VEGF expression was increased after doxycycline treatment. However, treatment with doxycycline alone did not induce the expression of HIF-1α or VEGF in Chang cells (data not shown). Consistent with the result of Western blot analysis, the increase of HIF-1α protein in the presence of HBx was demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). To further confirm the results, we introduced HBx into a non-hepatic origin HeLa cell line and measured protein level of HIF-1α. As shown in Fig. 1C, expression of HIF-1α as well as VEGF was increased upon HBx expression. Although the mRNA level of VEGF was largely increased, the level of HIF-1α was remaining unchanged in the presence of HBx. Because these results indicate that HBx increases the protein level of HIF-1α, perhaps through stabilization of HIF-1α, we measured HIF-1α protein in the presence of cycloheximide, which blocks new protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 1D, HBx induced strong expression of HIF-1α, and it blocked degradation of the protein as efficiently as CoCl2 treatment, which mimicked hypoxic condition. HBx Increases Nuclear Translocation and Phosphorylation of HIF-1α—For transcriptional activation of HIF-1α, the protein is required to translocate into nucleus (35Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed whether HBx influenced the subcellular localization of HIF-1α by immunofluorescence studies. As shown in Fig. 2, Chang cells showed very little HIF-1α immunoreactivity, which was diffused into cytoplasm. Chang X-34 cells that expressed HBx by doxycycline showed increased expression of HIF-1α, which was variably distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. HIF-1α was located in the nucleus in approximately 25% of cells and was located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in ∼60% of cells (Fig. 2). These results further confirmed that HBx increases the expression of HIF-1α protein and demonstrated that HBx enhances the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α. After treatment with CoCl2, the expression of HIF-1α in the doxycycline-treated Chang X-34 cells was further enhanced and the protein was almost completely localized in nucleus. The result was largely in contrast to that observed in Chang cells in which no significant induction nor nuclear translocation of HIF-1α was seen after CoCl2 treatment (data not shown). It has been reported that the Raf/MEK/p42/p44 MAPK signaling pathway stimulates transcriptional activity of HIF-1α (17Hur E. Chang K.Y. Lee E. Lee S.K. Park H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1216-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation and the resulting mobility shift of HIF-1α were inhibited by PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK pathway, indicating a direct effect of this signaling pathway on the transactivation function of HIF-1α (18Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Because HBx activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) by stimulating Ras-GTP complex formation (36Benn J. Su F. Doria M. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4978-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether the HBx protein induced phosphorylation of HIF-1α through the p42/p44 MAPK signaling pathway. First, we re-examined the migration pattern of HIF-1α in Chang X-34 cells by SDS-PAGE with an 8% gel (Fig. 3). Interestingly enough, the HIF-1α band was clearly separated into a fast and a slow migrating band. The slow migrating band, which represents phosphorylated and active status of HIF-1α, appeared in Chang X-34 cells and it became the most striking band in the presence of both doxycycline and CoCl2. In the same cell lysates, the p42/p44 MAPK was strongly activated when evaluated by Western blotting analysis using anti-phospho p42/p44 antibodies. When we employed a different doxycycline-inducible Chang cell clone, Chang X-31, basically the same results were obtained. However, the degree of both HIF-1α and p42/p44 MAPK activation was lower without doxycycline treatment in Chang X-31, which could be due to the lower leaky expression of HBx in the clone (34Yun C. Um H.R. Jin Y.H. Wang J.H. Le"
https://openalex.org/W2026390338,"Constitutive activation of the RET proto-oncogene in papillary thyroid carcinomas results from rearrangements linking the promoter(s) and N-terminal domains of unrelated genes to the C-terminus of RET tyrosine kinase (RET/PTC). RET/PTC expression has been demonstrated to inhibit transcription of thyroid-specific genes. To study the signal transduction pathways responsible for this, we generated PCCL3 thyroid cells with doxycycline-inducible expression of RET/PTC3, RET/PTC3(Y541F), or PTC2/PDZ. Acute expression of RET/PTC(Y541F) appropriately interacted with Shc, an intermediate in the activation of the Ras pathway, but failed to activate PLCgamma. By contrast, PTC2/PDZ failed to bind Shc, but interacted normally with PLCgamma. Acute expression of RET/PTC3 or RET/PTC3(Y541F), but not PTC2/PDZ, inhibited TSH-induced Tg and NIS expression, suggesting that activation of Shc-Ras, but not PLCgamma, is required for RET/PTC-induced dedifferentiation. Accordingly, acute expression of H-Ras(V12) or of a constitutively active MEK1 also blocked TSH-induced expression of Tg and NIS. Moreover, MEK inhibitors restored Tg and NIS levels. In conclusion, activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK pathway through Shc mediates RET/PTC-induced thyroid cell dedifferentiation. This suggests that inhibition of this pathway may promote redifferentiation in poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas with constitutive activation of either Ras or RET/PTC."

Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HSV-1, Herpes simplex virus type 1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IE, immediate early; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; CENP, centromere-associated proteins; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. is a common human pathogen that is capable of establishing a quiescent state of infection within sensory neurons following primary lytic infection of epithelial cells. HSV-1 gene expression during lytic infection occurs in a regulated temporal cascade with three groups of genes: immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) (reviewed in Ref. 1Roizman R. Knipe D.M. Fields B.N. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Lamb R.A. Martin M.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Knipe D.M. Fields Virology. 4th Ed. Vol. 2. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2001: 2399-2459Google Scholar). Although the majority of IE genes have been associated with the regulation of viral gene expression, only the IE protein ICP0 (also known as Vmw110) is capable of trans-activating all three classes of viral genes (reviewed in Ref. 2Everett R.D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Virus mutants that do not express ICP0 are severely impaired in their ability to replicate in limited passage human fibroblasts at low doses of input virus and are more likely to establish a quiescent infection. ICP0 is sufficient to reactivate quiescent viral genomes in both cultured cells and mouse models (2Everett R.D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 3Preston C.M.

Isler J.A. Davido D.J. Schaffer P.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6143-6153Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ICP0 has been reported to interact with various cellular proteins, including cyclin D3 (6Kawaguchi Y. Van Sant C. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7328-7336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), elongation factor EF-1δ (7Kawaguchi Y. Bruni R. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the transcription factor BMAL1 (8Kawaguchi Y. Tanaka M. Yokoymama A. Matsuda G. Kato K. Kagawa H. Hirai K. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1877-1882PubMed Google Scholar), and it forms a strong and specific interaction with ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 (also known as HAUSP) (9Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism by which ICP0 functions has yet to be determined, one crucial feature is its zinc-binding RING finger domain. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the RING finger domain of ICP0 has ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 11Hagglund R. Van Sant C. Lopez P. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). E3 ligases provide the substrate specificity to mediate the transfer of ubiquitin from ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) to substrate proteins targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome-mediated degradation (reviewed in Ref. 12Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). ICP0 has also been shown to induce the accumulation of co-localizing conjugated ubiquitin in vivo (13Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9994-10005Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and to induce the proteasome-mediated degradation of certain cellular proteins, including the major ND10 (PML nuclear body) constituent proteins PML and Sp100 (14Everett R.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5829-5835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (20Parkinson J. Lees-Miller S.P. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 650-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of all these proteins requires that ICP0 has an intact RING finger domain and provides strong evidence that ICP0 acts as an E3 ligase in vivo. However, to date, no specific substrate has been shown to be directly ubiquitinated by full-length ICP0. A number of DNA viruses have been shown to affect the stability of the major oncoprotein p53. The E6 protein of human papillomaviruses 16 and 18, in association with E6-AP, and the adenovirus E1B-55K/E4-orf6 complex, have both been shown to induce the degradation of p53 through ubiquitination (21Scheffner M. Huibregtse J.M. Vierstra R.D. Howley P.M. Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar, 22Querido E. Blanchette P. Yan Q. Kamura T. Morrison M. Boivin D.

Virol. 2002; 76: 9194-9206Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Conversely, the simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and the adenovirus E1B protein have been shown to inhibit specific p53 transcriptional functions through its sequestration (24Lowe S.W. Ruley H.E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 25Pipas J.M. Levine A.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). There is limited information on the fate of p53 during HSV-1 infection. A number of cellular proteins, including p53, have been shown to be recruited into HSV-1 DNA replication compartments (26Wilcock D. Lane D.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 429-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), although the significance of this recruitment remains unclear. The available evidence suggests that the overall p53 levels are not greatly affected in the HSV-1 infection systems so far examined. Analysis of HSV-1 mutants restricted in their ability to express IE proteins has shown that cell cycle arrest occurs independently of p53 (27Hobbs 2nd, W.E. DeLuca N.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8245-8255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the ICP0-induced mitotic block is a direct result of its ability to induce the degradation of CENP-A and CENP-C (19Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 18Lomonte P. Sullivan K.F. Everett R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5829-5835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cellular levels of p53 are typically maintained at a low level where p53 turnover is tightly regulated by ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation. Mdm2, the RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase responsible for p53 ubiquitination, binds to the N terminus of p53, and in conjunction with UbcH5, mediates the ubiquitination of C-terminal lysine residues, resulting in its eventual degradation by the 26 S proteasome (28Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 29Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 30Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Stabilization of p53 has been shown to occur by several mechanisms including phosphorylation of p53 and ADP ribosylation factor-mediated sequestration of mdm2. These mechanisms result in the inhibition of mdm2 interacting with and therefore ubiquitinating p53 (reviewed in Ref. 31Woods D.B. Vousden K.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Recently, Li et al. (32Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) demonstrated an alternative mechanism by which p53 could be stabilized. They showed that USP7 could bind directly to p53 and that the ubiquitin protease activity of USP7 was sufficient to deubiquitinate p53 targeted for degradation by mdm2 (32Li M. Chen D. Shiloh A. Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Qin J. Gu W. Nature. 2002; 416: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The authors proposed that this deubiquitination and consequent stabilization of p53 by USP7 provided an additional mechanism by which cells could regulate their p53 transcriptional response. Due to the strong and specific interaction formed between ICP0 and USP7 and the ability of ICP0 to act as a RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase, we wanted to determine whether ICP0 had any effect on p53. Our results show that ICP0 can recruit p53 in vivo independently of other viral proteins and during viral infection and that it can interact directly with p53 in vitro, independent of its USP7-binding domain. This interaction, in conjunction with the E3 ligase activity, of ICP0 is sufficient to allow ICP0 to mediate the ubiquitination of p53 both in vitro and in vivo in a RING finger-dependent manner. We also demonstrate that U2OS cells infected with an HSV-1 mutant that fails to express functional ICP0 are more susceptible to UV-induced apoptosis then those infected with wild type HSV-1. These results demonstrate that ICP0 is a genuine ubiquitin E3 ligase and suggest that one of its functions is to influence p53-mediated pathways. Plasmids—pCDNA-p53 and pCDNA-mdm2 were kind gifts from Ron Hay (University of St. Andrews). pGex2T-p53 was a kind gift from Nick La Thangne (Glasgow University). Plasmids expressing the E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH6, and cdc34 were gifts from Seth Sadis (Millennium Pharmaceuticals); the open reading frames were amplified from their respective pC-CMVFLAG backbone vectors by PCR and cloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen) as NdeI/NotI fragments allowing the insertion of sequences encoding a polyhistidine tag. pET3aUbcH7 and pTriexUbcH10 were kind gifts from Phil Robinson (University of Leeds). Plasmids pCI-110, pCI-FXE, pCI-M1, and pGex241 have been described previously (19Everett R.D. Earnshaw W.C. Findlay J. Lomonte P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1526-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). pCW7 (expressing polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin) was a kind gift from Ron Kopito (University of Standford). Construction of Baculoviruses—Viruses Ac.ICP0His, Ac.FXEHis, Ac.110, Ac.FXE, and Ac.E52X have been described previously (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Meredith M. Orr A. Elliott M. Everett R. Virology. 1995; 209: 174-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses Ac.CMV.EYFP and Ac.CMV.EYFP-ICP0 were constructed to express the relevant proteins in mammalian cells as follows. Plasmid pEYFP-ICP0 contains the NcoI-HpaI genomic fragment containing the ICP0 coding region inserted into the SmaI site of pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) to express an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-ICP0 fusion protein. The BglII-NdeI fragment of pCIneo that contains the 5′ part of the HCMV IE promoter region, was linked to the NdeI-HindIII fragment of pEYFP-ICP0 (containing the 3′ part of the HCMV promoter and the EYFP-ICP0 fusion fragment) and inserted into vector pFastBacHTa (Invitrogen) between its BamHI and HindIII sites. The resultant plasmid was used to generate recombinant baculovirus Ac.C-MV.EYFP-ICP0 by following the Bac-toBac protocol (Invitrogen). Similarly, the NdeI-XhoI EYFP coding region of pEYFP-C1 was inserted with the BglII-NdeI fragment of pCI-neo into the BamHI-SalI sites of pFastBacHTa, and the resultant plasmid was used to generate Ac.CMV.EYFP. Cells and Co-Transfection Assays—U2OS and mouse p53: mdm2(–/–) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at a cell density of 1.5 × 105 cells/dish and transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 10 ng of pCDNA-p53 plasmid, 50 ng of pCW7, and 100 ng of pCDNA-mdm2, pCI-110, pCI-FXE, or pCI-M1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Promoter competition was balanced by including appropriate amounts of pCI-neo vector, and empty pUC-9 was used to bring the total DNA amounts to 500 ng. At 16 h after transfection, the cells were treated with MG132 (final concentration 10 μm) and incubated for an additional 8 h. Cell monolayers were subsequently washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline before being harvested in either 1× SDS-PAGE boiling mix buffer containing 3 m urea and 25 mm dithiothreitol or 1 ml of guanidine HCl buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline plus 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol), pH 8.0. His-tagged ubiquitinated proteins were isolated by nickel affinity chromatography using 35 μl of equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) per sample as described in Ref. 34Treier M. Staszewski L.M. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted, and membranes were probed with either anti-p53 (Oncogene Ab-6) or anti-ICP0 (11060) monoclonal antibodies. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Aliquots of 1 × 105 U2OS cells were seeded onto 12-mm coverslips in 24-well dishes and infected with 50 plaque-forming units/cell of either Ac.CMV.EYFP or Ac.CMV.EYFP-ICP0. The cells were stained for immunofluorescence 16 h after infection using an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Ab-6, 1500) and a secondary Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1500) and examined by confocal microscopy as described previously (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Human fetal foreskin fibroblast cells (HFFF-2; European Collection of Cell Cultures) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, seeded onto coverslips at 1 × 105 cells/well, and then infected with HSV-1 strain 17+ at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units/cell or with HSV-1 virus FXE (35Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1185-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) that expresses the FXE RING finger mutant ICP0 protein, at a multiplicity of 0.1 plaque-forming units/cell. The strain 17+ and FXE-infected cells were fixed at 2 or 24 h after infection respectively and then stained for ICP0 (monoclonal antibody 11060) and p53 (rabbit FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescein isothiocyanateand Cy5-labeled secondary antibodies were used to prevent channel overlap. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Human ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), full-length ICP0, RING finger deletion mutant FXE, and GST-241 were purified as described (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. Clones expressing recombinant E2-conjugating enzymes and pGex2T-p53 were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacteria, and single colonies were used to inoculate 100 ml YTB broth. Cultures were grown to mid-log phase at 37 °C before being induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 25 °C. Bacterial pellets (equivalent to 10 ml of bacterial culture) were resuspended in 10 ml of the appropriate buffer, lysed by probe sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. UbcH5a, UbcH6, UbcH10, and cdc34 were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using 150 μl of equilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Supernatants were tumbled at 4 °C for 1 h before being washed with 3 × 1 ml of buffer A plus 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.5). Recombinant protein was eluted from the beads in 300 μl of buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, aliquoted, and stored at –70 °C. UbcH7 was purified by a combination of cation and anion exchange in buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The soluble supernatant fraction was bound to 1 ml of Q-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, and the flow-through was collected and bound to 1 ml of SP-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C. The column was extensively washed in buffer B before proteins were eluted using an NaCl gradient (0–0.6 m NaCl) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing UbcH7 were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. GST-p53 was purified in buffer C (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) using 150 μl of equilibrated GST beads (50% w/v) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were subsequently washed three times with 1 ml of buffer C. GST-p53 was eluted from the beads in 200 μl of buffer C plus 50 mm reduced glutathione (pH 7.5) and dialyzed against buffer C to remove glutathione. GST-p53 Pull-down Assays—Frozen SF21 cell pellets (equivalent to 4 × 106 cells) infected previously for 72 h at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with recombinant baculoviruses expressing ICP0, E52X, FXE, or mock-infected were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer C plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by gentle bath sonication, and the extracts were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. Extracts were precleared using 50 μl (50% w/v) of equilibrated GST beads in buffer C end-over-end for 45 min at 4 °C. 20 μl of GST beads prebound to either GST or GST-p53 were mixed with precleared supernatants for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with 200 μl in ice-cold buffer C. Soluble protein complexes were eluted from the beads in 30 μl of ice-cold buffer C containing 50 mm reduced glutathione (pH 7.5). The samples and 1100 input material were denatured by adding 10 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE boiling mix (as described above) and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-ICP0 monoclonal antibody 11060. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Ubiquitination Assays—In vitro transcription/translation was performed using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine following the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed either in the presence of 0.5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled substrate or in the presence of 50 ng of purified substrate protein. Reactions were carried out in buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP) containing an ATP regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine kinase, 0.6 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase) containing 20 ng of E1, 50 ng of E2, 5 μg of ubiquitin, and 50 ng of purified full-length ICP0, RING finger mutant (FXE), or GST-241. Reactions were carried out in a final volume of 10 μl for 3 h at 28 °C and terminated by the addition of 5 μlof3× SDS-PAGE boil mix buffer containing 9 m urea and 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were resolved either by 7.5% SDS-PAGE or by 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Gels were either Western blotted and probed with antiubiquitin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology P4D1) or with anti-p53 (Oncogene Ab-6) monoclonal antibodies or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, destained, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging. FACS Analysis—Aliquots of 4 × 105 U2OS cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes and were either mock-infected or infected with five plaque-forming units/cell with wild type HSV-1 syn17+ or dl1403 (ΔICP0) (35Everett R.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 1185-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), an HSV-1 mutant that fails to express ICP0. Following absorption, the cells were overlaid with medium containing 10 μm acycloguanosine to prevent the initiation of viral DNA replication. At 3 h after infection, the medium was removed, and then the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to a UV dose of 50 J/m2 (UV cross-linker, Stratagene). The cells were subsequently incubated in normal medium again containing acycloguanosine, and then detached, and adherent cells were harvested 24 h after UV irradiation using cell dissociation buffer (Sigma). The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were either stained directly for apoptotic markers using annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit (BD PharMingen) following the manufacturer's instructions or fixed and permeabilized using FIX & PERM cell permeabilization kit (Caltag Laboratories) and stained for the presence of ICP4 using the monoclonal antibody 58 S (36Showalter S.D. Zweig M. Hampar B. Infect. Immun. 1981; 34: 684-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences). ICP0 Ubiquitinates p53 in Vitro—We have reported previously that full-length ICP0 has ubiquitin E3 ligase activity in vitro and generates unanchored polyubiquitin chains in the presence of E2-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a and UbcH6 (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This activity requires ICP0 to have an intact RING finger domain. To test whether p53 could be ubiquitinated by ICP0, radiolabeled p53 was incubated in the presence or absence of a number of purified ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Fig. 1). Ubiquitinated p53 was readily detected in reactions containing ICP0 and a full complement of ubiquitin conjugation enzymes; ubiquitin, E1, and an E2, either UbcH5a or UbcH6. No significant p53 ubiquitination could be detected if either ICP0 or ubiquitin were omitted from the reaction mixture. The RING finger deletion mutant of ICP0, termed FXE (deletion of amino acids 106–146), was inactive in this assay. To determine whether the RING finger domain of ICP0 was sufficient to induce the ubiquitination of p53, reactions were carried out either in the presence of full-length ICP0 or in the presence of an N-terminal fragment of ICP0 containing the RING finger (amino acids 1–241) that has efficient E3 ligase activity in vitro (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated p53 was detected in complete reaction mixtures containing full-length ICP0 but not in those containing the RING finger fragment (Fig. 2A), despite the fact that this fragment is able to produce unanchored polyubiquitin chains with activity comparable with that of full-length ICP0 (Fig. 2B). This indicates that ubiquitination of p53 by ICP0 occurs in a substrate-specific manner and that ICP0 residues downstream of amino acid 241 are required for this activity. To confirm that ICP0 acted directly on p53 and not through additional proteins found within the rabbit reticulolysate used for the production of the p53 substrate, GST-tagged p53 was purified from bacteria and was found to be ubiquitinated only in the presence of a full complement of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ICP0 (Fig. 3). Therefore, ICP0 acts directly on p53 independently of other cellular proteins apart from those associated with the basic ubiquitination machinery. ICP0 has been reported previously by others to contain an additional E3 ligase domain within the C-terminal region of the protein (amino acid residues 616–680) (11Hagglund R. Van Sant C. Lopez P. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 37Hagglund R. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7889-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The authors reported that this domain of ICP0 stimulated the production of autoubiquitinated forms of the E2-conjugating enzyme cdc34 (UbcH3). However, in our original E2 screening assay using full-length ICP0, we could not detect the formation of any polyubiquitinated proteins in the presence of cdc34 (10Boutell C. Sadis S. Everett R.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). To test whether ICP0 stimulated the activity of cdc34 in a substrate-dependent manner, p53 ubiquitination reactions were performed utilizing a variety of different E2-conjugating enzymes. Ubiquitination of p53 was only detected in the presence of UbcH5a and UbcH6 and not with UbcH7, UbcH10, or cdc34 (Fig. 4), despite all the E2 preparations being able to form thiol-ester intermediates with ubiquitin (data not shown). ICP0 Interacts with p53 Independent of Its USP7-binding Domain—ICP0 forms a strong and specific interaction with USP7, resulting in increased amounts of USP7 co-localizing with ICP0 in ND10 domains during the early stages of infection (9Everett R.D. Meredith M. Orr A. Cross A. Kathoria M. Parkinson J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1519-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This interaction has been mapped to a region containing two lysine residues within the C-terminal region of ICP0 (33Meredith M. Orr A. Elliott M. Everett R. Virology. 1995; 209: 174-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To test whether the USP7-binding domain is required for ICP0 to interact with p53, GST-p53 pull-down assays were performed using soluble extracts containing ICP0 or ICP0 mutant proteins (Fig. 5). GST-p53, but not GST, formed soluble complexes with full-length ICP0, the RING finger deletion mutant FXE (deletion of amino acids 106–146), and the USP7 negative binding mutant E52X (deletion of amino acids 594–775) (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that p53 binds to ICP0 via sequences that do not include its RING finger or USP7-binding domains. As p53 binds to E52X but is not ubiquitinated by the N-terminal RING finger domain of ICP0 (Fig. 2), the p53 interaction domain appears to be located between amino acids 241 and 594 of ICP0. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the E52X protein ubiquitinated p53 with activity comparable with that of full-length ICP0 (data not shown), demonstrating that ICP0 does not require its USP7-binding domain, nor an interaction with USP7, to bind to and ubiquitinate p53. ICP0 Ubiquitinates and Recruits p53 in Vivo—To determine whether ICP0 could ubiquitinate p53 in vivo, p53(–/–): mdm2(–/–) mouse cells were transfected with plasmids expressing p53, polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin, mdm2, wild type ICP0, or various ICP0 mutants. The cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 at 16 h after transfection and incubated for a further 8 h before analysis (Fig. 6). Ubiquitinated p53 in whole cell extracts could readily be detected in the presence of p53 and mdm2 (Fig. 6A) but not in the presence of any of the ICP0 proteins tested (Fig. 6B). As p53 undergoes numerous post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation, we investigated whether a minor subpopulation of p53 molecules could be ubiquitin"

https://openalex.org/W2086510997,"Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an early response gene induced in renal mesangial cells by interleukin-1β (IL-1β). The 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of COX-2 mRNA plays an important role in IL-1β induction by regulating message stability and translational efficiency. The first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 are highly conserved and contain multiple copies of the regulatory sequence AUUUA. Introduction of the 60-nucleotide sequence into the 3′-UTR of a heterologous reporter gene resulted in a 70% decrease in reporter gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that mesangial cell nuclear fractions contain a multimeric protein complex that bound this region of COX-2 mRNA in a sequence-specific manner. We identified four members of the protein-RNA complex as HuR, TIA-1, TIAR, and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U). Treatment of mesangial cells with IL-1β caused an increase in cytosolic HuR, which was accompanied by an increase in COX-2 mRNA that co-immunoprecipitated with cytosolic HuR. Therefore, we propose that HuR binds to the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 following stimulation by IL-1β and increases the expression of COX-2 mRNA by facilitating its transport out of the nucleus.

Many early response genes encoding cytokines, lymphokines, and proto-oncogenes are transiently expressed in response to extra cellular stimuli. Although the gene can be transcriptionally regulated, the level of expression is determined in large part by changes in the half-life and/or translational efficiency of the mRNA. These changes are regulated through interactions between specific RNA sequences and trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that influence nuclear export, targeting to the ribosome, and translation of the mRNA into protein. Among the best studied regulatory sequences are the adenosine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs), 1The abbreviations used are: ARE, adenosine- and uridine-rich element; COX, cyclooxygenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; RT, reverse transcription; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; TTP, tristetraprolin; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region. found in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of many short lived mRNAs (1Shaw G.

Most AREs contain multiple copies of the sequence AUUUA, which are sufficient to confer message instability when placed in the 3′-UTR of a normally stable reporter message. Additionally, AREs can play a role in regulating translational efficiency of target mRNAs (6Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R.P. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M.

Once cells are activated by specific extracellular signals, these same ARE sequences are required for message stabilization and/or increased translational efficiency. Several RNA-binding proteins have been isolated based on their ability to regulate mRNA expression through ARE sequences. Some of these proteins promote message expression, e.g. hnRNP A1 (9Hamilton B.J. Burns C.M. Nichols R.C. Rigby W.F. J. Biol.

All of these proteins are believed to function in the cytoplasm but appear to be regulated by shuttling in and out of the nucleus. The mechanism whereby AREs regulate message expression in the presence of multiple and sometimes diametrically opposed signals is not fully understood. Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins (19Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). Three isoforms of COX have been identified as follows: 1) COX-1, a constitutively expressed isoform; 2) COX-2, an early response gene that can be induced by a variety of mitogenic and pro-inflammatory stimuli; and 3) COX-3, an alternatively spliced variant of COX-1 (20Chandrasekharan N.V. Dai H. Roos K.L.T. Evanson N.K. Tomsik J. Elton T.S. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13926-13931Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). In rat mesangial cells, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) caused a significant increase in COX-2 expression due, in part, to altered mRNA stability and translational efficiency (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J.

The 3′-UTR of COX-2 is greater than 2 kilobases in length and, depending on the species, contains 11–22 copies of the ARE core sequence AUUUA. It has been shown previously that the 3′-UTR of COX-2 contains multiple regulatory elements, some of which co-localized with several of the AREs (18Anant S. Henderson J.O. Mukhopadhyay D.

One such element identified in the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2 contained seven AUUUA repeats and was able to decrease message stability and translational efficiency of a heterologous reporter gene (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This region of the murine 3′-UTR is highly conserved across species and aligns within the region of human COX-2 mRNA that was shown to bind HuR (27Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), AUF1 (25Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47338-47351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dysregulated expression of HuR promoted increased COX-2 expression in colon cancer cells (27Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of HuR and other yet to be determined proteins to the 3′-UTR of COX-2 is likely to play an important role in regulating COX-2 expression. In this report we show that HuR, TIA-1, TIAR, and hnRNP U bind the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2. Stimulation of mesangial cells with IL-1β resulted in a transient increase in cytosolic HuR and associated COX-2 mRNA, suggesting that HuR plays a regulatory role by facilitating the transport of COX-2 mRNA out of the nucleus. Mesangial Cell Culture—Primary rat mesangial cell cultures were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (28Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Amer. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F634-F641PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.6% (v/v) insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 15 mm HEPES. Where indicated, mesangial cells were stimulated with IL-1β (100 units/ml) for 60 min. Plasmids—Reporter gene constructs were generated as described previously (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, various regions of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 were amplified by PCR using primers terminating in XbaI recognition sequences. PCR products were ligated in the unique XbaI site of the pGL3 control vector (Promega) located in the 3′-UTR of the firefly luciferase gene. Vectors used for synthesis of RNA probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were constructed by amplifying the same 3′-UTR sequences, except that the primers encoded a HindIII recognition site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end. The PCR products were ligated into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pcDNA3 (Stratagene). Transient Transfections—Mesangial cells were transiently transfected using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen). Cells were plated into 60-mm dishes, grown to 50–75% confluency, and transfected with 5 μg of reporter gene plasmid DNA at a 2:1 SuperFect-to-DNA ratio. Following transfection, cells were incubated overnight for gene expression. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was determined using a luciferase assay system following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Briefly, cell monolayers in 60-mm dishes were removed by scraping into 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer. Cells were vortexed, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (30 s at 12,000 × g). Luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (EG & G Wallac) as described previously (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test, Inc.). Luciferase RNA was quantified by RT-PCR using TaqMan real-time PCR. Luciferase amplification primers were 5′-GCGCGGAGGAGTTGTGTT-3′ for the forward primer, 5′-TCTGATTTTTCTTGCGTCGAGTT-3′ for the reverse primer, and 6-FAM-TGGACGAAGTACCGAAAGGTCTTACCGG-TAMRA as the TaqMan probe. Luciferase expression was normalized to ribosomal RNA as measured using TaqMan ribosomal RNA control reagents (Applied Biosystems). Relative amounts of luciferase cDNA were calculated by the comparative CT method (Applied Biosystems user bulletin number 2) and expressed as a percentage of luciferase cDNA measured in cells transfected with pGL3-control. COX-2 RNA was quantified by RT-PCR using primers and probes purchased from Applied Biosystems (Assays-on-Demand number MM-00478374). RNA Probe Synthesis—Labeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase plus (Ambion) and RNA probe plasmids (described above) as template. A sequence-nonspecific probe was generated using EcoR1 linearized TOPO TA cloning vector pCR 2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) as template. Transcription reactions contained 100 units of T7 polymerase, 500 μm each ATP, CTP, and GTP, 12.5 μm UTP, 200 μCi of [32P]UTP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 mm DTT, and 10 μg of plasmid template linearized by BamHI digestion in a total volume of 50 μl of 1× transcription buffer (Ambion). Transcription reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For cold probes, [32P]UTP was substituted with 500 μm UTP. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using Sephadex G-25 mini Quick Spin RNA columns (Roche Applied Science). Cell Fractionation—Rat mesangial cells were harvested by scraping into hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, and 0.1 mm NaVO4 with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml Pefabloc) and allowed to swell for 15 min. Cells were lysed by adding 10% Nonidet P-40 (final concentration, 0.25%), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (30 s at 15,000 × g). Supernatant was centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g and stored as the cytoplasmic fraction at -70 °C. The nuclei were washed two times by centrifugation (1500 × g for 10 min) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm MgCl2. The final pellet was resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH7.5, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, and 25% glycerol with protease inhibitors). Nuclei were incubated on ice for 15 min with vortexing every 2–3 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction and stored at -70 °C. EMSAs and Antibody Supershifts—Typically, 5–10 μg of cell fraction protein was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 5 mg/ml heparin) with 1–5 pmol of labeled RNA probe in a final volume of 20 μl. For supershift experiments, binding mixtures included 0.2 μg of affinity-purified IgG raised against HuR, TIA-1, TIAR, or TTP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1 μg of affinity-purified anti-AUF1 (Upstate Biotechnology), 1 μl of anti-hnRNP A1 and anti-hnRNP U (generous gift of Gideon Dreyfuss), or 1 μl of normal goat serum (Sigma). RNase T1 (10 units) was added to EMSA or supershift samples and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Loading buffer (5 μl) containing 80% glycerol and 0.1% bromphenol blue in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, was added, and samples were electrophoresed (250 V for 2.5 h) on 4% polyacrylamide gels (pre-run for1hat250V) containing 44 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 44 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, 4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (29:1), and 2.5% glycerol. EMSAs were visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies were immobilized onto an agarose gel using a Seize Primary immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce Biotechnology). An equivalent of 3 μg of immobilized antibody was added to 5 mg of nuclear protein and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were isolated by centrifugation (1 min at 12,000 × g) and washed two times with immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2). Total RNA was extracted from immunoprecipitates using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Western Analysis—Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were separated by PAGE-SDS and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore). Western blots were probed with monoclonal anti-HuR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution. Signal detection was carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Western analysis of cell fractionations was carried out using a polyclonal anti-U1 snRNP 70 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution and a monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (Ambion) at a 1:4000 dilution. Cytosolic HuR was quantitated on the Discovery Series densitometer, and the band intensities were measured using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). AREs from the 3′-UTR of COX-2 Regulate Message Stability—The first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 message contains multiple copies of the sequence AUUUA (Fig. 1, Truncation #1). We have reported previously that this region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 had a significant effect on post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These 60 nucleotides contain a major translational control element and caused a decrease in message stability when placed in a chimeric reporter gene expressed in an immortalized mouse mesangial cell system. In this study, we used primary rat mesangial cells to further define key regulatory sequences and trans-acting protein factors that may play important roles in regulating the expression of COX-2 in response to stimulation with IL-1β. Insertion of the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 into the 3′-UTR of a luciferase reporter message resulted in a 70% decrease in luciferase activity and a similar decrease in steady-state mRNA levels when expressed in primary rat mesangial cells (Fig. 2). This region contains seven copies of the sequence AUUUA, i.e. three that are overlapping and located within the proximal 25 nucleotides and four copies clustered within the distal 28 nucleotide region (Fig. 1, Truncation #1). Removal of the first 19 nucleotides (Fig. 1, Truncation #2) disrupted the proximal overlapping AUUUA repeats but had no effect on luciferase reporter gene activity or mRNA levels (Fig. 2). Truncation from the proximal 5′-end to nucleotide 24 (Fig. 1, Truncation #3) resulted in an additional 75% decrease (93% overall) in luciferase activity and mRNA levels (Fig. 2). This deletion coincides with the removal of all of the first three AUUUA consensus sequences (Fig. 1, Truncation #3), suggesting that the first 24 nucleotides contain a positive control element and that the distal 17 nucleotides contained a negative control element. Nuclear Protein Complexes Bind to COX-2 AREs—To determine whether changes in luciferase activity following truncation of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 were reflected by altered binding of protein(s) to this region of the message, we performed EMSAs using radiolabeled RNA probes corresponding to the regions of the three truncations shown in Fig. 1 and protein fractions isolated from rat mesangial cells. Incubation of the RNA probe encoded by the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 with mesangial cell nuclear protein fractions resulted in the formation of three prominent RNA-protein complexes (Fig. 3). The RNA-protein interaction was sequence-specific, because the addition of increasing concentrations of non-labeled RNA of the same nucleotide sequence effectively competed for all three complexes, whereas there was no effect when including equal amounts of a non-related RNA of the same size derived from the TOPO TA cloning vector. All of the three complexes were present at similar levels using each of the various truncated RNA probes (Fig. 4; non-immune controls), suggesting that removal of the proximal portion of the RNA had no significant effect on the formation of the RNA-protein complexes. Incubating probes with cytosolic fractions also resulted in formation of three RNA-protein complexes that had a similar electrophoretic mobility but at a consistently lower intensity compared with complexes formed using an equal mass of nuclear proteins (results not shown). Stimulation of rat mesangial cells with IL-1β for 30–120 min had no effect on the pattern of shift and little or no change in the intensity of the shifted RNA probe (results not shown).Fig. 4Identification of several RNA-binding proteins that recognize the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. Radiolabeled RNA probes corresponding to nucleotides 1–60 (probe 1), 20–60 (probe 2), or 24–60 (probe 3) of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 were incubated with proteins from nuclear cellular fractions in the presence of non-immune serum (NI) or antibodies raised against the AUF1, TIA-1, HuR, and TIAR (A) or TTP, hnRNP A1, hnRNP U, and probe alone (B). Protein-RNA complexes (C1, C2, and C3), free probe (FP), and supershifted complexes (S1 and S2) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) TIA-1, TIAR, HuR, and hnRNP U Bind the ARE Region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2—As a first step toward identifying which proteins were present in the protein-RNA complexes, we included in the binding incubation antibodies to known RNA-binding proteins, as well as non-immune serum as a control, and assessed either the formation of a higher molecular weight RNA-protein complex (supershift) or disruption of one or more of the RNA-protein complexes. Both results would suggest that the epitope recognized by the antibody was present in the complex. The three major RNA-protein complexes were still present when non-immune serum was included in the binding reaction (Fig. 4, lanes labeled NI). In contrast, inclusion of both anti-TIA-1 and anti-TIAR antibodies produced a supershift (Fig. 4A, S1) that was accompanied by a significant reduction in RNA-protein complex C2. The intensity of the supershift increased as the RNA probe was truncated, suggesting that a more stable complex forms between TIA-1 and TIAR and the shortened RNA probes. Addition of HuR antibody also resulted in a supershift (Fig. 4A, S2) and a loss of the C3 complex. The supershift was most prominent with the 60-nucleotide probe and decreased as the probes were truncated. However, the disappearance of the C3 complex occurred to the same extent for all three RNA probes. A less prominent complex migrating below complex C3 also disappeared from the 1–60 probe when HuR antibodies were added, suggesting that HuR may form more than one complex with COX-2 RNA. Thus, it appears that HuR binds all the RNA probes, but only in the presence of the 1–60 probe was a complex formed that was stable enough to result in a supershift. A supershift was also observed when using the anti-hnRNP U antibody (Fig. 4B, S1). In this case, the supershift was only seen in the presence of the truncated probes and failed to occur with the full-length probe. Inclusion of antibodies directed against TTP or hnRNP A1 failed to show any observable supershift but did result in a decreased intensity of some of the complexes, raising the possibility that these proteins may also be directly or indirectly associated with the RNA probes. In our hands, EMSA experiments using mesangial cellular fractions failed to detect formation of a protein-RNA complex between AUF1 and this region of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2. Stimulation of Rat Mesangial Cells with IL-1β Caused a Transient Increase in Cytosolic HuR—It has been reported that HuR is shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to various cellular stresses (29Fan X.C.

To determine whether cytoplasmic HuR increased in response to IL-1β stimulation, we isolated cytoplasmic protein fractions from mesangial cells at various times after treatment with IL-1β and determined the HuR protein content. The purity of the cell fractions was assessed by Western analysis using an antibody directed against the splicing factor U1 snRNP 70 as a marker of nuclear fractions and an antibody against GAPDH as a cytosolic protein marker. The Western results indicate that we have isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic cell fractions that are free of any detectable cross-contamination and that the vast majority of HuR resides in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 5A). When we probed for cytosolic HuR using increasing amounts of protein, we found that HuR was detectable in the cytosol and that cells treated with IL-1β for 60 min had appreciably more cytosolic HuR than non-stimulated control cells (Fig. 5B). Time course experiments indicate that cytosolic HuR increased as early as 15 min following administration of IL-1β and peaked at 30 min (Fig. 6A). Cytosolic levels of HuR remained elevated for at least 4 h and returned to control levels within 24 h. There was no appreciable decrease in nuclear HuR levels, presumably due to the fact that only a small portion of total HuR exited the nucleus. Cytosolic GAPDH remained constant over this time period (Fig. 6A).Fig. 6IL-1β caused a time-dependent increase in cytosolic HuR and HuR-COX-2 mRNA complexes. A, representative Western blot of cytosolic proteins (60 mg) separated by PAGE-SDS and analyzed for GAPDH and HuR. Cytosol was isolated from mesangial cells treated with IL-1β for the indicated number of minutes or treated for 24 h. B, cytosolic fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-HuR antibodies. Total RNA was extracted from precipitates, and COX-2 mRNA was quantified by RT-PCR using TaqMan real-time PCR and a COX-2 cDNA clone as standard. Results represent the average of two independent experiments each measured in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because HuR binds the 3′-UTR of COX-2 in the EMSA experiments and IL-1β stimulation increased cytosolic HuR, we next tested whether there were corresponding changes in cytosolic HuR-COX-2 mRNA complexes. Cytosolic fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-HuR antibodies, and the amount of co-immunoprecipitated COX-2 mRNA was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The DNA transcribed by reverse transcriptase was quantitated using a cDNA clone of COX-2 as standard. The amount of COX-2 mRNA present in immunoprecipitates of cytosolic fraction from non-stimulated cells was below the detectable limit of the assay. Cells treated with IL-1β contained detectable amounts of cytosolic HuR-COX-2 mRNA complexes that increased from 30 to 60 min (Fig. 6B), suggesting that increased transport of HuR into the cytosol facilitated the export of COX-2 mRNA. Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is tightly orchestrated through complex interactions of various RNA-binding proteins with target mRNAs. The best characterized target sequence is the ARE. Identification of different ARE-binding proteins and the elucidation of their functions has been the subject of many recent investigations. The AREs located in the proximal region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 play an important role in regulating gene expression (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol.

This region also has been shown to be recognized by the RNA-binding proteins HuR (27Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), AUF1 (25Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47338-47351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here we report that the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2 were recognized by TIA-1, TIAR, and hnRNP U, in addition to HuR. Based on EMSAs using truncated RNA probes we have shown that TIA-1 and TIAR both bind to a 37-nucleotide region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2 mRNA. This corresponds to the region reported to affect message translation (21Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Both TIAR and TIA-1 have been shown to bind an ARE-containing region of the 3′-UTR of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), resulting in translational silencing of the TNF-α message (6Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R.P. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 8Gueydan C. Droogmans L. Chalon P. Huez G. Caput D. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2322-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of TIA-1 in COS cells resulted in decreased expression of a reporter gene harboring the ARE region of TNF-α (35Kedersha N. Cho M.R. Li W. Yacono P.W. Chen S. Gilks N. Golan D.E. Anderson P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems probable that binding of TIA-1 and/or TIAR to the 3′-UTR of COX-2 promotes translational silencing of the message. We also found that hnRNP U binds to this region of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. It is not clear at this moment what the functional significance of this binding is; however, hnRNP U has been shown to bind RNA (36Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 37Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) as well as other proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor (38Eggert M. Michel J. Schneider S. Bornfleth H. Baniahmad A. Fackelmayer F.O. Schmidt S. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28471-28478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The ability to bind both RNA and proteins raises the possibility that hnRNP U may act as a scaffolding protein and mediate interactions between target mRNAs and proteins regulating mRNA expression. Based on the report by Lasa et al. (25Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we predicted that AUF1 and the 3′-UTR of COX-2 could form a protein-RNA complex stable to EMSA and supershift assays. The inability to detect a stable complex may represent differences in cell-type and/or species-specific interactions or be due to differences in experimental conditions. Another well characterized ARE-binding protein is HuR. Binding of mRNA by HuR is associated with increased message stability (10Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3448-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 11Peng S.S. Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 39Dean J.L.E. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A number of HuR target mRNAs have been reported, including the message encoding COX-2 protein (27Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We have determined that one of the HuR binding sites is within the first 60 nucleotides of the 3′-UTR of murine COX-2, as evidenced by the HuR antibody-dependent supershift (Fig. 4A, S2). The supershift was accompanied by a significant decrease of a major RNA-protein complex, C3, and a minor lower molecular weight complex. When truncated RNA probes were incubated with the anti-HuR antibody, the decrease in C3 was still evident, but there was no supershift (Fig. 4A), suggesting that more than one HuR-RNA complex was present and that the more stable supershifted complex required the full 60-nucleotide probe. Translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been shown in response to a variety of stimuli, including heat shock (29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 30Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 31Brennan C.M.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), UV light (33Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and nutrient limitation (34Yaman I. Fernandez J. Sarkar B. Schneider R.J. Snider M.D. Nagy L.E. Hatzoglou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41539-41546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In response to heat shock, HuR binds the proteins pp32 and APRIL, which modulates the ability to transport HuR out of the nucleus through interactions with nuclear export factor CRM1 (31Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The CRM1-dependent transport can be inhibited by leptomycin B. Recently, it has been reported that leptomycin B inhibited COX-2 mRNA stabilization by blocking nuclear export of the COX-2 message (40Jang B.C. Munoz-Najar U. Paik J.H. Claffey K. Yoshida M. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2773-2776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although it was not determined whether HuR played a direct role in the transport of COX-2 mRNA, it does represent a reasonable conclusion. Here, we show that IL-1β stimulation caused an increase in cytosolic HuR protein levels and HuR-COX-2 mRNA complexes. Thus, we propose that in response to IL-1β stimulation there was increased binding of HuR to COX-2 mRNA, which facilitates export of the message out of the nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that multiple proteins can bind to a relatively short portion of the 3′-UTR of COX-2. The types of proteins we have identified have profound effects on message expression by regulating mRNA export from the nucleus and influencing the ability of the message to be either transported to polysomes for translation or targeted for degradation. Some of these proteins, such as HuR and TIA-1, apparently have contradictory effects on the fate of the target message. Therefore, the challenge still remains to determine the mechanism whereby cells decide whether to increase or decrease gene expression when presented with RNA-protein complexes containing potentially opposing regulatory proteins."

With an intrinsically bound calmodulin, iNOS is fully active once expressed in cells. Thus, regulation of NO production from iNOS was thought to primarily occur at the enzyme transcriptional level. Here we show that NO synthesis from iNOS can be profoundly modulated by heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) through protein-protein interaction. To study whether hsp90 affects iNOS function, recombinant murine iNOS was purified from an Escherichia coli expression system by affinity chromatography. Hsp90, at physiological concentrations (10-500 nm), dose-dependently increased iNOS activity. This was a specific effect because neither denatured hsp90 nor irrelevant bovine serum albumin affected iNOS function. Overexpression of hsp90 enhanced NO production in iNOS-transfected cells. On the contrary, hsp90 inhibition dramatically decreased NO formation from iNOS in macrophages. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that hsp90 and iNOS associated with each other in cells. Overexpression of iNOS resulted in NO-mediated cellular injury. Hsp90 inhibition markedly attenuated NO formation and prevented cellular injury. These results demonstrated that hsp90 is an allosteric enhancer of iNOS. iNOS is coupled with hsp90 in cells, and this coupling facilitates NO synthesis. In light of the critical role of hsp90 in iNOS-mediated cytotoxic action, modulating the interaction between hsp90 and iNOS may be a new approach to intervene inflammation and immune response.

In cells, NO is produced by a family of NO synthases (NOSs) including neuronal NOS (nNOS, type I), inducible NOS (iNOS, type II), and endothelial NOS (eNOS, type III) (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). Although arisen from separate genes, all three NOS isoforms catalyze a similar reaction in which l-arginine and oxygen are converted to NO and l-citrulline (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-w.

The catalytic activity of eNOS and nNOS was conventionally thought to be initiated by the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Recent studies revealed that the function of eNOS and nNOS was modulated in a far more complex fashion (6Papapetropoulos A. Rudic R D. Sessa W.C. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In particular, eNOS and nNOS were found to be critically regulated by protein-protein interactions and protein phosphorylation (7Fulton D. Gratton J P. Sessa W.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

These proteins either directly target on NOS catalysis or influence the biological function of eNOS and nNOS through affecting their subcellular localization. Among them, the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) was found to be a positive modulator of both eNOS and nNOS. Hsp90 was first shown to associate with eNOS and acted as an allosteric enhancer (12García-cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 14Gratton J.P. Fontana J. O' Connor D.S. García-cardeña G. McCabe T.J. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

Further studies demonstrated that hsp90 can also function as a module to recruit Akt, which subsequently phosphorylates the serine 1179/1177 residue of eNOS (bovine/human) leading to a Ca2+-independent enzyme activation (15Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Cir. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). nNOS was also found to associate with hsp90, and this association augmented nNOS activity (16Bender A.T. Silverstein A.M.

J. 2001; 355: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The enhancing action of hsp90 on nNOS appears to be mediated by the increased calmodulin (CaM) binding affinity and decreased superoxide release (17Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1819-C1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Song Y. Cardounel A.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10616-10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Unlike the constitutive eNOS and nNOS, little or no iNOS expression can be found in cells under normal conditions. iNOS expression is mainly induced by inflammatory mediators such as various cytokines and microbial products (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). iNOS possesses higher NO-generating potency than the other two isoforms. NO generated from iNOS damages cells and serves as an important mediator in inflammation and host defense (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 20Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In contrast to eNOS and nNOS whose bindings with CaM require elevated Ca2+, iNOS strongly binds with CaM at basal Ca2+ concentrations in quiescent cells (21Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Thus, iNOS is constantly active once expressed. NO production from iNOS therefore is thought to be chiefly regulated at enzyme transcription and expression levels (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). So far, it remains unclear whether or not iNOS function can be directly regulated by posttranslational interactions with other proteins rather than CaM. In this study, we provided evidence demonstrating that hsp90 is an important posttranslational modulator of iNOS. We found that hsp90 associated with iNOS, and this association enhanced iNOS activity in vitro and in intact cells. Our results also revealed that normal hsp90 function was essential in the cytotoxic action of iNOS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen.

Commun. 1996; 222: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Two liters of terrific broth (Invitrogen) culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol were initiated with 40 ml of overnight bacterial culture (E. coli strain BL21 transformed with pCW-iNOS and pACYC-CaM vectors) and shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at A 600 = 0.8-1.0 after adding 0.4 mm heme precursor δ-aminolevulinic acid at A 600 = 0.6-0.8. The bacterial culture was continuously shaken for another 48 h at 150 rpm at room temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in homogenation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm l-arginine, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μm BH4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitor tablet, and 10% glycerol). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were homogenated by freezing/thawing and sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min and the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+ chelate affinity column (HiTrap, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 24 column volumes of washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol), and bound proteins were eluted by 300 mm imidazole. Eluates were then loaded on a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose affinity column. After washing with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol), bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm 2′-AMP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). Eluted proteins were concentrated by Centricon devices (Amicon) and passed through a Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column. The iNOS-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated. All of the chromatographies were performed on the AKTA-purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein content of iNOS preparations was assayed with Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standards. The purity of iNOS was determined by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The iNOS preparations exhibited similar catalytic activity as reported previously (23Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Purified iNOS was stored in buffer with 10% glycerol at -80 °C.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293), COS-7, and mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Murine iNOS cDNA in pBS-KS II (kindly provided by Dr. Charles Lowenstein, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag (Stratagene) using standard molecular biology procedures (22Wu C. Zhang J. Abu-Soud H. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). pCMV-iNOS and pcDNA3-hsp90 (human hsp90β) vectors were transfected to HEK 293 or COS-7 cells by PolyFect reagents (Qiagen) according to the manufacture's instruction. Two days after transfection, the expression of appropriate proteins was examined. Expression of iNOS in RAW 264.7 cells was induced by 16 h of stimulation of 2 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli serotype O26:B6) and 100 units/ml recombinant mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (25Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar).l-[14C]Arginine to l-[14C]Citrulline Conversion Assay—iNOS-catalyzed l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline conversion was monitored in a total volume of 200 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 μm l-[14C]arginine, 17 μm l-arginine, 0.5 mm NADPH, 1 μm BH4, and 10 nm iNOS. To determine the effects of hsp90, iNOS was preincubated with different concentrations of hsp90 for 10 min. The reactions were initiated by adding l-[14C]arginine and terminated by stop buffer after 2 min of incubation (linear range of l-citrulline formation) at 37 °C. l-[14C]Citrulline was separated by passing the reaction mixture through Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Na+ form) cation exchange columns and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (24Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9030-9033Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar).To monitor iNOS-catalyzed l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline conversion in intact cells, RAW264.7 cells were induced by LPS (2 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 16 h. After being washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were labeled with l-[14C]arginine (10 μCi/ml) in Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) for 30 min. The cells then were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 0.25% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside). l-[14C]Citrulline in the lysates were separated by Dowex AG 50W-X8 (Na+ form) columns and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. l-NAME (1 mm) inhibitory activity was employed to determine the amounts of l-[14C]citrulline converted by iNOS.Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed on ice in the following lysis buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation (16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), the supernatants were pooled and incubated with 2 μg of primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were harvested by protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After extensive washing, immunoprecipitates were eluated by 5-min boiling of the beads in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) and characterized by Western blotting with appropriate antibodies.Western Blotting—Harvested cells were lysed in Lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranocide, and protease inhibitor tablet) on ice for 40 min. After a brief centrifugation (16,000 × g for 5 min), the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Samples were electrophoresed on 4-12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-iNOS polyclonal or anti-hsp90 monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). Immunoblots were developed on films using the ECL technique (Amersham Biosciences).EPR Spectroscopy and Spin Trapping—EPR measurements of NO were performed on 107 cells in phosphate-balanced buffer using the iron complex of DETC (Fe3+-(DETC)2, Fe-DETC, 0.5 mm) as spin trap (18Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1819-C1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EPR spectra were recorded in a quartz flat cell at room temperature (23 °C) with a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer operating at X-band with a TM110 cavity using a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, modulation amplitude of 0.5 G, microwave power of 20 milliwatts, and microwave frequency of 9.785 GHz. The microwave frequency and magnetic field were precisely measured using an EIP 575 microwave frequency counter and Bruker ER 035 NMR gaussmeter. NO signals were quantitated by double integration as described previously (18Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1819-C1824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Nitrite/Nitrate and Cell Viability Assays—Total nitrate and nitrite released in cell culture medium was measured by a nitrite/nitrate colorimetric assay kit (Cayman Chemical). Cell viability was monitored by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (26Thykjaer T. Christensen M. Clark A.B. Hansen L.R. Kunkel T.A. Orntoft T.F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transfected with iNOS vector were cultured in the absence and presence of hsp90 inhibitor or NOS inhibitor for 24 h. To evaluate iNOS-mediated cytotoxicity in macrophages, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (2 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 16 h. Cells then were incubated with MTT (5 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °Cand solubilized by 1% SDS solution containing 10 mm HCl. The reduced MTT was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer.Statistics—Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were made using a two-tailed Student's paired or unpaired t test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05.RESULTSWe first determined the effect of hsp90 on iNOS function in vitro using purified enzyme preparations. Recombinant murine iNOS was isolated from an E. coli expression system by affinity chromatography. The purity and catalytic activity of the iNOS preparations were characterized (Fig. 1). Purified iNOS displayed a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, which was in agreement with the molecular mass of native iNOS reported previously (3Nathan C. Xie Q.-w. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar, 4Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Masters B.S.S. McMillan K. Sheta E.A. Nishimura J.S. Roman L.J. Martasek P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme preparations exhibited strong l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]citrulline-converting activity, and this was abolished by the specific NOS inhibitor l-NAME (500 μm). This catalytic activity did not require addition of Ca2+/CaM, a characteristic feature of iNOS. To determine the effect of hsp90 on iNOS, iNOS activity was measured in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of hsp90. As shown in Fig. 2, hsp90 at physiological concentration range (10-500 nm) dose-dependently increased iNOS activity. With the presence of 500 nm hsp90, iNOS activity increased >2-fold (308.9 ± 40.7% of control activity in the absence of hsp90, p < 0.001, n = 6). To confirm that the effect of hsp90 was a specific action, experiments were also conducted to measure iNOS activity in the presence of heat-denatured hsp90 (500 nm) or irrelevant protein bovine serum albumin (500 nm). Neither heat-denatured hsp90 nor bovine serum albumin affected iNOS activity. These results demonstrated that hsp90 specifically enhanced iNOS function in vitro.Fig. 2Effect of hsp90 on iNOS activity. iNOS activity was measured in the reaction system consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 μm l-[14C]arginine, 17 μm l-arginine, 0.5 mm NADPH, 1 μm BH4, and 10 nm iNOS in the absence (Control) and presence of hsp90 (10-500 nm). As shown, hsp90 dose-dependently augmented iNOS activity. In contrast, neither heat denatured hsp90 (500 nm) nor the irrelevant protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) (500 nm) affected iNOS activity (Mean ± S.E.; ***, p < 0.001, compared with control, n = 6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether hsp90 augments iNOS catalytic function inside cells, we transfected iNOS and hsp90 into HEK 293 cells and monitored NO production. Neither non-transfected HEK 293 cells nor the cells transfected with empty vectors expressed iNOS, and thus little NO formation was measured (Fig. 3). Transfection of iNOS to these cells resulted in NO formation. Co-transfection of hsp90 vector increased the levels of hsp90 in cells. Although similar levels of iNOS were present, a significant increase of NO production was seen in hsp90 co-transfected cells (5.5 ± 0.7 μm) as compared with that in the cells transfected with iNOS only (2.3 ± 0.4 μm, p < 0.001, n = 7). These data suggested that hsp90 also enhanced iNOS activity in intact cells.Fig. 3Overexpression of hsp90 enhanced NO production in iNOS-transfected cells. iNOS and hsp90 were transfected into HEK 293 cells, and NO formation was measured by monitoring the nitrite and nitrate released in the cell culture medium. Alterations of intra-cellular iNOS and hsp90 levels were revealed by Western blotting. Data were shown as mean ± S.E. (***, p < 0.001, versus the cells transfected with iNOS only; n = 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To study whether hsp90 modulates iNOS function in macrophages, EPR spin-trapping NO measurements were performed on RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (2 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml). As expected, LPS/IFN-γ stimulation induced iNOS expression and a strong characteristic triplet NO spectrum was recorded from stimulated cells (Fig. 4A, Control). Incubation with hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (20 μm) for 1 h markedly decreased NO production from these cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In consistent with the results of EPR NO measurements, iNOS-catalyzed l-[14C]citrulline formation in intact cells was also reduced by geldanamycin (20 μm) (Fig. 4C). Another hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (20 μm), whose structure is different from ansamycin derivative geldanamycin, also inhibited NO formation from iNOS. Neither geldanamycin nor radicicol treatment affected iNOS and hsp90 expression levels in cells (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that normal hsp90 function was needed for iNOS-catalyzed NO synthesis in macrophages.Fig. 4Hsp90 inhibition decreased NO formation from iNOS in macrophages. A, EPR spectra of NO formation from control, geldanamycin (GA), and radicicol-treated macrophages. iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 cells was induced by 16-h stimulation of LPS (2 μg/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml). NO production was detected from untreated cells (Control) and the cells treated with geldanamycin (20 μm) or radicicol (20 μm) for 1 h. NO was measured by spin-trap Fe-DETC (0.5 mm). EPR measurements were conducted at room temperature with a microwave frequency of 9.785 GHz, microwave power of 20 milliwatts, and 0.5-G modulation amplitude. Representative spectra shown were from three independent measurements. B, effects of geldanamycin and radicicol on NO formation from RAW 264.7 cells. Data were shown as mean ± S.E. (**, p < 0.01, versus control, n = 6). C, effect of geldanamycin (20 μm) on l-[14C]citrulline formation in intact RAW 264.7 cells (**, p < 0.01, versus control, n = 3). D, geldanamycin or radicicol treatment did not alter the expression levels of iNOS and hsp90 in LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated cells. Blottings of β-actin were used to confirm equal sample loading. Representative blots were shown from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To explore whether hsp90 and iNOS can physically associate each other, immunoprecipitations of iNOS were carried out on both control and LPS/IFN-γ-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Although both control and stimulated cells contained the same levels of hsp90, immunoprecipitation of iNOS resulted in a co-precipitation of hsp90 in stimulated cells but not in control cells (Fig. 5A). Similarly, immunoprecipitation of hsp90 also co-precipitated iNOS in stimulated cells but not in control non-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B). These findings suggested that iNOS coupled with hsp90 in macrophages.Fig. 5iNOS coupled with hsp90 in macrophages. Immunoprecipitations were performed on control and LPS/IFN-γ-induced macrophages. A, immunoprecipitation (IP) was carried out with anti-iNOS antibody. B, IP was conducted using anti-hsp90 antibody. Western blotting (WB) using both anti-hsp90 and anti-iNOS antibodies showed that iNOS and hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated each other. Representative data were shown from triplicate experiments. C, the possible region of iNOS responsible for hsp90 binding. Previous study identified that the hsp90 binding domain of eNOS was located between amino acids 300 and 400 (15Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Cir. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). BLAST search revealed that the sequence between iNOS residues 337 and 407 shared 70% identity with that in the region of eNOS amino acids 329-399. The identical amino acids shared by both iNOS and eNOS were shown in boldface characters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the functional significance of the hsp90-iNOS interaction, we studied the roles of hsp90 in iNOS-mediated cytotoxicity. iNOS was transfected into COS-7 cells, and NO production was measured and correlated with the alterations of cell viability. As shown in Fig. 6, control non-transfected COS-7 cells produced little NO and displayed normal viability. Robust NO formation was detected from the cells after iNOS transfection. Correspondingly, significant amounts of cells were damaged (65.1 ± 3.3% cell viability, p < 0.001 compared with control cells, n = 12). Treating the cells with hsp90 inhibitor radicicol markedly inhibited NO formation. As a result, cell injury was largely prevented (89 ± 4.6% cells viable). The classic NOS inhibitor l-NAME (500 μm) also blocked NO formation and protected cells. Neither radicicol nor l-NAME changed the levels of iNOS expressed in cells. These results demonstrated that normal hsp90 function was required in the cytotoxic action of iNOS.Fig. 6Role of hsp90 in iNOS-mediated cytotoxicity. COS-7 cells transfected with iNOS expression vector were cultured in the absence and presence of hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (5 μm) or NOS inhibitor l-NAME (500 μm). NO production (upper panel) was determined by measuring the nitrite and nitrate released in the medium. Cell viability (lower panel) was monitored by MTT assay. As shown, iNOS transfection resulted in strong NO formation leading to cell damage. Both radicicol and l-NAME decreased NO production in iNOS-transfected cells and prevented cell injury. Neither radicicol nor l-NAME treatment changed the levels of iNOS expression in cells. Data were shown as mean ± S.E. (***, p < 0.001, versus the control non-transfected cells, n = 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Finally, we determined the role of hsp90 in controlling iNOS-mediated cytotoxicity in macrophages. As shown in Fig. 7, induction of iNOS expression by LPS/IFN-γ caused a significant cellular injury (57 ± 1.5% cell viability, p < 0.001, n = 6). Both hsp90 inhibitor radicicol (5 μm) and NOS blocker l-NAME (1 mm) prevented this cellular damage (94.8 ± 3.6% and 92.2 ± 5.6% c"
https://openalex.org/W2168379147,"Ceramide is known to induce structural rearrangements in membrane bilayers, including the formation of ceramide-rich and -poor domains and the efflux of aqueous solutes. This report describes a novel effect of ceramide, namely the induction of transbilayer lipid movements. This effect was demonstrated in both model (large unilamellar vesicles) and cell (erythrocyte ghost) membranes in which ceramide generation took place in situ through the action of an externally added sphingomyelinase. Two different novel assays were developed to detect transbilayer lipid movement. One of the assays required the preparation of vesicles containing a ganglioside only in the outer monolayer and entrapped neuraminidase. Sphingomyelinase activity induced ganglioside hydrolysis under conditions in which no neuraminidase was released from the vesicles. The second assay involved the preparation of liposomes or erythrocyte ghosts labeled with a fluorescent energy donor in their inner leaflets. Sphingomyelin hydrolysis was accompanied by fluorescence energy transfer to an impermeable acceptor in the outer aqueous medium. Ceramide-induced transbilayer lipid movement is explained in terms of another well known property of ceramide, namely the facilitation of lamellar to non-lamellar lipid-phase transitions. Thus, sphingomyelinase generates ceramide on one side of the membrane; ceramide then induces the transient formation of non-lamellar structural intermediates, which cause the loss of lipid asymmetry in the bilayer, i.e. the transbilayer movement of ceramide together with other lipids. As direct targets for ceramide tend to be intracellular, these observations may be relevant to the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by means of the sphingomyelin pathway.

As direct targets for ceramide tend to be intracellular, these observations may be relevant to the mechanism of transmembrane signaling by means of the sphingomyelin pathway. Cell membranes are asymmetric in the steady state, i.e. lipid and protein compositions of the inner and outer leaflets are not the same. Far from being a static phenomenon, this asymmetry arises from a series of constant and concerted transmembrane movements leading to an apparently invariant distribution of bilayer components. Lipid asymmetry in particular is known to be altered in physiological or pathological events such as recognition by phagocytes, blood coagulation, or apoptosis (see Ref. 1Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W.C. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar for a review). The collapse of lipid asymmetry is often known as “lipid scrambling.” Sphingomyelin is a phospholipid localized mainly at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, where it was originally conceived to act in a structural manner to provide a semipermeable barrier to the extracellular environment (2Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In 1987, however, it was reported that 1,2-diacylglycerols induce sphingomyelinase activation in GH3 pituitary cells (3Kolesnick R.N. Paley A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9204-9210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was suggested for the first time that this response may activate a sphingomyelin-based signaling pathway (4Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7617-7623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kolesnick R.N. Clegg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6534-6537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, Okazaki et al. (6Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) confirmed this notion, demonstrating that receptor binding of vitamin D3 induced sphingomyelinase activation and that the generated ceramide served as a second messenger in a differentiation pathway of HL-60 cells. Over the past decade, ceramide and other sphingolipids have been identified as primary regulators of signal transduction involved in multiple biological functions (8Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Mathias S. Peña L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that much of the sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane exists in preformed microdomains in mammalian cells (10Simons K. Ikonen E. Science. 2000; 290: 1721-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) called rafts and that this is the site of ceramide generation and signal transmission (11Kolesnick R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Ceramide was originally conceived of as a classic second messenger, directly and stoichiometrically activating a set of target proteins (see below) (8Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Mathias S. Peña L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that ceramide may act in part by physically altering the structure and properties of membrane rafts. In this context, it has been suggested that ceramide generated in rafts induces their coalescence into larger platforms and that these macrodomains serve as a site for oligomerization of cell surface receptors such as Fas and CD40 (12Grassme H.

In this paradigm, acid sphingomyelinase is initially translocated onto the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane where it catalyzes the hydrolysis of raft-associated sphingomyelin. Ceramide affects a number of membrane properties in model membrane systems, which may impact platform formation in biological membranes; ceramide increases lipid order, gives rise to ceramide-rich separate domains, and destabilizes the lamellar structures, inducing membrane permeabilization and membrane fusion (see Ref. 17Kolesnick R.N. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar for a review). As a consequence, treating defined model membrane systems containing sphingomyelin with sphingomyelinase has been found to produce, via ceramide formation, vesicle efflux (18Ruiz-Argüello M.B.

Over the past decade, a number of direct targets for ceramide have been explored as mediators of ceramide signaling.

Ceramide exhibited a high affinity toward the C1b domain, exceeding the binding affinity of the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Other potential ceramide targets, such as kinase suppressor of Ras and c-Raf-1, also contain C1b domains, but whether the C1b domain targets these proteins to sites of ceramide generation, such as plasma membrane rafts, is presently unknown. However, these targets are intracellular, and it is presently uncertain whether ceramide generated on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane can initiate their activation. The present study was intended to address, using biophysical techniques, the question of how sphingomyelin hydrolysis on one side of a bilayer might induce transbilayer lipid reorganization. We have developed two novel systems to examine ceramide-induced transfer across a membrane bilayer, one of which we have applied to large unilamellar vesicles and the other to both vesicles and resealed erythrocyte ghosts. In all three cases, we observe transmembrane lipid movements in parallel with sphingomyelinase activity. Materials—Acid sphingomyelinase (EC 3.1.4.12) from Bacillus cereus was obtained from Sigma and was used in the presence of 2 mm o-phenanthroline to inhibit traces of contaminant phospholipase C activity. Previous studies showed that o-phenanthroline did not affect sphingomyelinase activity, in agreement with published data (37Ikezawa H. Mori M. Ohyabu T. Taguchi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 528: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ADP-dependent short chain acyl-CoA hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.18) from Clostridium perfringens, cholesterol, Triton X-100, and N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose from bovine colostrum were obtained from Sigma. Egg sphingomyelin (SM) 1The abbreviations used are: SM, egg sphingomyelin; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; Rho-IgG, tetramethylrhodamine goat anti-mouse IgG; GM3, monosialoganglioside; NBD, N-(7-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl); Ch, cholesterol; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles. and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and monosialoganglioside (GM3) was obtained from Larodan AB (Sweden). Tetramethylrhodamine goat anti-mouse IgG (Rho-IgG) and N-(7-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sephadex G-75 and HiTrap protein G were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). YM-100 Centricon filters (100,000 molecular weight cut-off) were purchased from Millipore. A polyclonal antibody against neuraminidase was raised in rabbits according to Ref. 54Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar. Sodium dithionite was purchased from Fluka (Biochemika, Switzerland). Liposome Preparation—SM/PE/Ch (2:1:1 molar ratio) large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by the extrusion method (38Mayer L.D. Hope M.H. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) using Nuclepore filters of 0.1-μm pore diameter at room temperature, as detailed previously (39Nieva J.L. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7364-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of the extruded vesicles showed that the extrusion procedure did not modify their composition. LUV were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5. When required, neuraminidase (0.16 unit/ml) was added to the hydration buffer. In this case, non-entrapped neuraminidase was removed by gel filtration through Sephadex G-75. Asymmetric Incorporation of Glycolipids—To incorporate GM3 ganglioside to the outer monolayer of liposomes prepared as described above, the glycolipids in organic solvent were dried and resuspended in a volume of methanol that was 5% of the vesicle suspension volume. Vesicles were added to this methanolic glycolipid solution so that GM3 was 10 mol % of the total lipids. After vortex mixing, they were left to incubate for 15 min at room temperature (40Villar A.V. Alonso A. Pañeda C. Varela-Nieto I. Brodbeck U. Goñi F.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purification of Anti-neuraminidase IgG—The antibody raised in rabbits against neuraminidase was separated from hemoglobin by using a HiTrap protein G affinity column; 1 ml of the mixture was passed through the column, and the HiTrap column was washed 3 times with a 20 mm phosphate, pH 7, buffer to remove hemoglobin. Anti-neuraminidase IgG was eluted from the affinity column with a 0.1 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, buffer. Enzyme Assay—All experiments were performed at 37 °C, lipid concentration was 0.3 mm, and enzymes were used at 1.6 units/ml for sphingomyelinase on LUV, 0.16 unit/ml for sphingomyelinase on erythrocytes, and 0.16 unit/ml for neuraminidase. Sphingomyelinase activity was assayed by determining phosphorous content (41Böttcher C.S.F. Van Gent C.M. Fries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (854) Google Scholar) in the aqueous phase of an extraction mixture (chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid, 200/100/1, by volume) after the addition of aliquots from the reaction mixtures at different times. Sialic acid formed after treatment of liposomes containing GM3 with neuraminidase was determined by using a modification of the resorcinol-sialic acid assay (42Wybenga L.E. Epand R.F. Nir S. Chu J.W.K. Sharom F.J. Flanagan T.D. Epand R.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9513-9518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). When required, neuraminidase activity was tested with an artificial substrate, N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose. Neuraminidase Inhibition by Anti-neuraminidase IgG—LUV containing entrapped neuraminidase were prepared as above and diluted to 0.3 mm lipid. The vesicle suspension was treated with Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) to release the enzyme; 100 μl of the anti-neuraminidase IgG (0.5 μg/μl) was then added, and the reaction mixture was left to incubate for 30 min. Then, 0.03 mm N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose was added, and the production of sialic acid was measured after 1 h. A control in the absence of IgG was performed simultaneously. Ghost Membrane Preparation—Human erythrocyte ghost membranes were obtained by a modified Steck and Kant method (43Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 44Fussle R. Bhakdi S. Sziegoleit A. Tranum-Jensen J. Krans T. Wellensiek H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The membranes obtained from 20 ml of erythrocyte concentrate (as provided by the blood bank) were washed three times by centrifugation in 0.9% NaCl, and the pellet was resuspended with cold 1.2 mm acetic acid, 4 mm MgSO4, pH 3.2, buffer, left for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged. In the next step, the pellet was suspended in 3 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, containing 3 μm NBD-PE, and then membranes were stabilized and allowed to reseal by incubating them for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing 3 times by centrifugation in the same buffer, the resulting membrane suspension was layered over 43% sucrose in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and centrifuged for 60 min at 27,500 × g (TST 55.5 rotor, Kontron) (45Siskind L. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The resealed ghosts floating on top of the sucrose solution were harvested and washed 3 times in the 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, buffer. At this step, the ghosts were labeled with NBD on both sides of the membranes. To eliminate the outer leaflet label, we used 0.6 mm sodium dithionite, which reduced outer NBD and thus abolished its fluorescence. Reduction was monitored in an LS50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature with a continuously stirred cuvette. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 465 and 530 nm, respectively. A cut-off filter (515 nm) was used to prevent contamination from scattered light. Labeled ghosts were separated from excess sodium dithionite by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in the buffer described above. LUV Labeled in the Inside Bilayer with NBD-PE—SM/PE/Ch LUV were prepared by using the method described above, including 0.6 mol % NBD-PE. To eliminate the outer leaflet NBD-PE fluorescence, the same dithionite method described above for ghost membranes was used, except that to separate LUV from excess sodium dithionite, a Sephadex G-75 chromatography column was used. Fluorimetric Assays—All experiments were performed at 37 °C, lipid concentration was 0.3 mm for LUV assays and 0.09 mm for ghost assays, and sphingomyelinase was used at 1.6 unit/ml and 0.16 unit/ml for LUV and ghost assays, respectively. Aliquots (50 or 100 μl for LUV or ghost membranes, respectively) were removed from the reaction mixture at regular intervals and mixed with 10 μl of Rho-IgG in 10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 6.5, buffer to a final volume of 500 μl. Energy transfer was monitored by using an LS50 spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the same conditions described above. Ganglioside Translocation in Lipid Vesicles—LUV composed of SM:PE:Ch (2:1:1 molar ratio) were treated with GM3 ganglioside in methanol to obtain vesicles containing GM3 (∼10 mol % of total lipid) located exclusively on the outer leaflet (40Villar A.V. Alonso A. Pañeda C. Varela-Nieto I. Brodbeck U. Goñi F.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These vesicles contained neuraminidase and when kept at 4 °C, the vesicles were stable for at least 12 h; no significant amount of GM3 was hydrolyzed in this period of time. Addition of sphingomyelinase (1.6 units/ml) to a suspension of these vesicles induced SM hydrolysis, which reached equilibrium after ∼20 min, when ∼40% of SM had been hydrolyzed (Fig. 1A). Addition of Triton X-100 after 60 min caused membrane disruption, but SM hydrolysis did not go beyond 50% at 30 min after detergent addition, i.e. 90 min after sphingomyelinase addition. Previous experiments had shown that this Triton X-100 concentration did not inhibit sphingomyelinase or neuraminidase. Aliquots of the vesicle suspension were removed at fixed times after the addition of sphingomyelinase and analyzed for the GM3 product of neuraminidase activity, sialic acid. GM3 was hydrolyzed almost in parallel with SM, except that no saturation was observed (Fig. 1B). After the addition of Triton X-100, virtually all GM3 was cleaved by neuraminidase. One interpretation of these data is that, as a consequence of sphingomyelinase activity, GM3 was flipping to the inner leaflet, thus becoming accessible to neuraminidase. However, it was necessary to rule out the possibility of neuraminidase coming out from the vesicles as a result of sphingomyelinase activity. Ceramides increase membrane permeability (18Ruiz-Argüello M.B. Basañez G. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26616-26621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Montes L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11788-11794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 45Siskind L. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and an efflux of molecules up to 40 kDa has been observed in sphingomyelin-treated vesicles (19Montes L.R. Goñi F.M. Alonso A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11788-11794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Neuraminidase has a molecular mass of 70 kDa. To clarify this aspect, neuraminidase activity outside the sphingomyelinase-treated vesicles was assayed with the water-soluble substrate N-acetylneuraminyl-lactose. For this purpose, aliquots of the vesicle suspension were filtered through YM-100 Centricon filters, which allow the easy passage of neuraminidase. Neuraminidase activity in the filtrates is shown in Fig. 2A. Even in the absence of sphingomyelinase activity (time zero), ∼18% of the total enzyme activity was recovered in the filtrates. This is probably because of vesicle breakdown due to shear stress during the filtration procedure. Vesicles containing GM3 but not sphingomyelinase or internal neuraminidase were treated with neuraminidase at the concentration found in the filtrates. Neuraminidase was added to the vesicle suspension from the outside to ensure enzyme-substrate interaction. In this case (as seen in Fig. 2B), the time course of GM3 hydrolysis is totally different from the one depending on sphingomyelinase activity. Thus, the results in Fig. 1B cannot be explained on the basis of neuraminidase efflux from the vesicles. An additional control was performed in which any extravascular neuraminidase would have been neutralized by a specific antibody. With this aim, a polyclonal antineuraminidase antibody was raised in rabbits. We verified that the purified antineuraminidase IgG at 50 μg/ml completely abolished neuraminidase activity at 0.16 unit/ml. The same concentration of IgG had no effect on sphingomyelinase activity. When the experiment described in Fig. 1 was repeated with 50 μg/ml antineuraminidase antibody in the medium (Fig. 2C), no significant differences were found between the fractions of hydrolyzed GM3 in the presence and absence of antibody (Student's t test, p > 0.05 for all pairs of data points). We concluded that GM3 hydrolysis was catalyzed by neuraminidase inside the vesicles; thus, sphingomyelinase activity had caused GM3 to flip to the inside lipid monolayer. Fluorescence Energy Transfer in Lipid Vesicles—A completely different assay was developed to test the transmembrane movement of lipids in a system in which sphingomyelinase activity was likely to cause membrane permeabilization to solutes of Mr ≤ 40,000. This novel procedure was based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between NBD-PE and Rho-IgG. Energy transfer between NBD and rhodamine is well known and often used in membrane studies. Our modification consisted of using rhodamine bound to an irrelevant IgG, whose large Mr (150,000) ensured that, in principle, it could not penetrate the vesicles. LUV were prepared as usual, except that 0.6 mol % NBD-PE was included in the lipid mixture. After preparation, the vesicle suspension was treated with the essentially impermeable reducing agent sodium dithionite, so that NBD in the outer monolayers was reduced and its fluorescence was abolished. Excess dithionite was removed immediately by gel filtration. LUV labeled with NBD only in their inner lipid leaflets were then treated with sphingomyelinase. Enzyme activity was the same as described in Fig. 1A. Aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at regular intervals and mixed with Rho-IgG in buffer. As the sphingomyelinase reaction proceeded, NBD-PE flopped toward the outer monolayer, and energy transfer to Rho-IgG could take place. Consequently, when the fluorescence of NBD-PE was excited, its emission intensity decreased with time, and the emission intensity of Rho-IgG increased accordingly. The corresponding data are shown in Fig. 3. Control experiments, also shown in the figure, indicated that in the absence of sphingomyelinase, NBD-PE fluorescence remained invariant with time. Thus, fluorescence energy transfer measurements confirm that sphingomyelinase activity induces the transmembrane movement of lipids. Fluorescence Energy Transfer in Erythrocyte Ghosts—A similar procedure was applied to erythrocyte ghosts to explore the transbilayer movement of lipids induced by sphingomyelinase in a cell membrane. Unsealed ghosts were treated with NBD-PE, which became incorporated into both membrane leaflets. Ghosts were then resealed and treated with dithionite to reduce outer leaflet NBD. Excess dithionite was removed by repeated centrifugation and washing. Sphingomyelinase activity reached equilibrium in erythrocyte membranes much faster than in liposomes (compare Figs. 1A and 4A). The experiments in Fig. 4 were obtained by using 0.16 unit/ml sphingomyelinase, i.e. 110 of the amount used with liposomes. The reasons for this high rate of sphingomyelin degradation in red blood cells are currently the object of a separate investigation in this laboratory. Because of the fast ceramide production, fluorescence resonance energy transfer was detected in ghosts after a very short time (Fig. 4B). The correlation between rates of ceramide production and energy transfer (compare Figs. 3 and 4B) supplies additional evidence that SM hydrolysis is driving the transmembrane lipid movement.

https://openalex.org/W2036136999,"We investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in activating the store-operated Ca2+ channels in endothelial cells via the expression of transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) isoforms. We observed that TNF-α exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells resulted in TRPC1 mRNA and protein expression, whereas it had no effect on TRPC3, TRPC4, or TRPC5 expression. The TRPC1 expression was associated with increased Ca2+ influx after intracellular Ca2+ store depletion with either thrombin or thapsigargin. We cloned the 5′-regulatory region of the human TRPC1 (hTRPC1) gene which contained a TATA box and CCAAT sequence close to the transcription initiation site. We also identified four nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-binding sites in the 5′-regulatory region. To address the contribution of NF-κB in the mechanism of TRPC1 expression, we determined the effects of TNF-α on expression of the reporter luciferase after transfection of hTRPC1 promoter-luciferase (hTRPC1-Pro-Luc) construct in the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line. Reporter activity increased >4-fold at 4 h after TNF-α challenge. TNF-α-induced increase in reporter activity was markedly reduced by co-expression of either kinase-defective IKKβ kinase mutant or non-phosphorylatable IκB mutant. Treatment with NEMO-binding domain peptide, which prevents NF-κB activation by selectively inhibiting IKKγ interaction with IKK complex, also blocked the TNF-α-induced TRPC1 expression. Thus, TNF-α induces TRPC1 expression through an NF-κB-dependent pathway in endothelial cells, which can trigger augmented Ca2+ entry following Ca2+ store depletion. The augmented Ca2+ entry secondary to TRPC1 expression may be an important mechanism of endothelial injury induced by TNF-α.

The increase in [Ca2+] i occurs in two distinct phases: transient rise due to intracellular Ca2+ store depletion and second sustained phase due to Ca2+ entry into the cell from extracellular medium (9Tiruppathi C.

TRP genes encode a superfamily of proteins with six transmembrane helices that are divided into three subfamilies: TRPC, TRPV, and TRPM (17Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Members of the TRPC subfamily contain 700–1000 amino acids, and the seven isoforms (TRPC1–7) are expressed in mammalian cells. Mammalian TRPCs are grouped into four subfamilies as follows. (i) The first consists of TRPC4 and TRPC5. Their activation is dependent on Ca2+ store depletion, and they have high Ca2+ selectivity as assessed by sensitivity to La3+ (10Nilius B. Droogmans G.

TRPC4 and TRPC5 are activated by G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases coupled to phospholipase C. (ii) TRPC1 is closely related to TRPC4 and TRPC5; it forms SOCs but is a less Ca2+-selective channel. (iii) TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 form store-independent non-selective cation channels that may be activated by diacylglycerol (10Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 17Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

A number of studies showed that TRPC expression patterns in human vascular endothelial cells differs from the mouse (13Freichel M. Schweig U. Stauffberger S. Freise D. Schorb W. Flockerzi V. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) showed by RT-PCR the expression of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 transcripts in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Moore et al. (20Moore T.M. Brough G.H. Badal P. Kelley J.J. Li M. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L574-L582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed the expression of TRPC1 in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC), and TRPC1-mediated Ca2+ influx caused endothelial cell shape change. Inhibition of TRPC1 expression by transfecting TRPC1-specific antisense oligonucleotide reduced the thapsigargin-induced increase in [Ca2+] i as well as store-operated Ca2+ entry current in HPAEC (20Moore T.M. Brough G.H. Badal P. Kelley J.J. Li M. Stevens T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L574-L582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that human vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC, HPAEC, and human dermal microvessel endothelial cell line (HMEC)) express TRPC1 and, to a lesser extent, TRPC3 and TRPC4 (21Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. FASEB J. 2002; 16 (abstr.): 673.8Google Scholar). We also showed that increased expression of TRPC1 in HMEC resulted in increased thrombin-induced Ca2+ influx as well as store-operated cationic current compared with controls (21Paria B.C. Malik A.B. Tiruppathi C. FASEB J. 2002; 16 (abstr.): 673.8Google Scholar). Although previous studies have established that TRPC1 is a critical component of SOC in human vascular endothelial cells, the regulation of TRPC1 expression is not known. We showed by the genomic data base analysis of the 5′-regulatory region of human TRPC1 (hTRPC1) the presence of multiple binding sites for transcription factor NF-κB. Therefore, we addressed the role of TNF-α, the pro-inflammatory cytokine known to activate NF-κB (22Fan J. Ye R. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L1037-L1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in inducing the expression of TRPC1 in human vascular endothelial cells. We showed that TNF-α increased the NF-κB-dependent expression of TRPC1 and that this resulted in an augmented store-operated Ca2+ influx. Thus, TRPC1-mediated Ca2+ influx in endothelial cells may play an important role in signaling endothelial cell activation and injury subsequent to sepsis-induced vascular inflammation.

Cell Culture—HUVEC were grown in EGM-2 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured on tissue culture dishes precoated with 0.1% gelatin. HUVEC used in the experiments were between 3 and 6 passages. HMEC were grown to confluence in endothelial basal medium MCDB131 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 2 mml-glutamine, and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR —Confluent HUVEC monolayers were washed with serum-free medium and incubated with 1% FBS-containing medium for 2 h. After this period, the endothelial cells were treated with 1000 units/ml TNF-α in the presence or absence of actinomycin D (0.5 μm) in 1% FBS-containing medium for different time intervals. After TNF-α treatment, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. RT was performed using oligo(dT) primers and superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendation. Human TRPCs and GAPDH were amplified using the following primer sets: TRPC1 (forward, 5′-GATTTTGGAAAATTTCTTGGGATGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTTGTCTTCATGATTTGCTATCA-3′); TRPC3 (forward, 5′-GACATATTCAAGTTCATGGTCCTC-3′), reverse, 5′-ACATCACTGTCATCCTCAATTTC-3′); TRPC4 (forward, 5′-GCTTTGTTCGTGCAAATTTCC-3′, reverse, 5′-CTGCAAATATCTCTGGGAAGA-3′); TRPC5 (forward, 5′-CAGCATTGCGTTCTGTGAAAC-3′, reverse 5′-CAGAGCTATCGATGAGCCTAAC-3′), and GAPDH (forward, 5′-TATCGTGGAAGGACTCATGACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TACATGGCAACTGTG AGGGG-3′). RT product (2 μl) was amplified in a 50-μl volume containing 100 pmol of primers and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. Reaction conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min for 35 cycles, and then 72 °C for 7 min. For intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) amplification, we used these primers: forward, 5′-AGCAATGTGCAAGAAGATAGCCAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTCCCCTGCGTGTTCCACC-3′). The reaction conditions are as follows: 5 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s) followed by 30 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). Amplification of GAPDH was also performed following the protocol described above. PCR products were resolved by using 1.2% agarose gel and identified by ethidium bromide staining. The band intensity of scanned gel photograph was determined by using Scion imaging software (from the National Institutes of Health). Normalization of TRPC1 and ICAM-1 expression was achieved by comparing the expression of GAPDH for the corresponding sample. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting experiments were performed to examine TRPC1 expression in response to TNF-α in HUVEC. After TNF-α exposure, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (mixture from Roche Applied Science)). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane strips. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at 22 °C and then incubated with anti-TRPC1 antibody TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, the strips were incubated horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. The strips were washed, and the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Cloning of myc-TRPC1—RT-PCR method was used to clone full-length coding region of hTRPC1. The primers for PCR amplification was designed from the hTRPC1 sequence (GenBank™ accession number U31110). The hTRPC1 cDNA was obtained by RT reaction performed using 1 μg of DNase-treated total RNA isolated from HUVEC. The middle portion of an 840-bp hTRPC1 was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-ATATATCGATGTTTGGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGTAGGATGGAATGCATCCCA-3′. The 5′-end of hTRPC1 was amplified using the following primers: forward, 5′-ATGATGGCGGCCCTGTACCCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGAATAACTTCCAATTCACGG-3′. The 3′-end of hTRPC1 was obtained by PCR using the following primers: forward, 5′-AGAATCTCGTAATCAACTCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CACTTAATTTCTTGGATA-3′. The PCR-amplified fragments for the 5′- and 3′-end were 865 and 1027 bp, respectively. The overlapping region was 212 bp between 5′-end and middle portion and 130 bp between 3′-end and middle portion. The 5′-end and the middle portion were first ligated by PCR using the high fidelity Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and the DNA fragment obtained was PCR-ligated again with the 3′-end to obtain the full-length coding sequence for hTRPC1. The DNA obtained was cloned into pCR3.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen), and the orientation was checked by restriction analysis. The hTRPC1 sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Furthermore, to obtain NH2-terminal Myc-tagged TRPC1 cDNA, the full-length hTRPC1 was PCR-amplified and subcloned into pCMV-Myc mammalian expression vector (Clontech). In this PCR, the following primers were used: forward, 5′-ATAATAGTCGAC(SalI)CATGGCGGCCCTG-3′, and reverse 5′-ATAATAGCGGCCGC(NotI)TTACATAGCATATTTAG-3′. Both the PCR-amplified DNA and the pCMV-Myc vector were double-digested with SalI and NotI and then the digested products were ligated to obtain Myc-TRPC1 construct. Cloning of Human TRPC1 Promoter—About a 3.2-kb size hTRPC1 5′-regulatory region sequence was obtained from human genomic data base. The human BAC clone (RPCI-11.C; GenBank™ accession number AC072028) containing the hTRPC1 promoter was PCR-amplified using the primer set: forward, 5′-ATGGTGCTGGGATAATTGGCAAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AATGGAGAGCCAGAC TCGTGG-3′. The 2.1-kb hTRPC1 5′-regulatory region (starting from –1685 to +440) was amplified using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). PCR-amplified hTRPC1 5′-regulatory region was sequenced to determine correct nucleotide sequence. We also PCR-amplified the hTRPC1 5′-regulatory region using DNA isolated from HUVEC using DNAzol reagent. Before PCR amplification, DNA isolated from HUVEC, digested with NotI to generate the 12-kb DNA fragment which contained the hTRPC1 5′-regulatory region, was used as a template for PCR amplification. We obtained an ∼2-kb size fragment from this PCR. This fragment was sequenced and aligned with human genomic sequence (see Fig. 4A) and also compared with PCR product obtained using BAC clone as template. The PCR products were cloned into TOPO cloning vector (pCR2.1, Invitrogen) and used for nucleotide sequencing. Primer walking method was used to sequence the cloned DNA fragment. The sequencing was done by the commercial facility (ACGT, Northbrook, IL). We observed that 106 bp (from –991 to –885) were absent in HUVEC-DNA PCR fragment. Moreover, the sequence (–991 to –885) did not reveal the presence of any putative transcription factor binding sites. Therefore, we cloned the PCR fragment, ∼2 kb, obtained using HUVEC-DNA as template into pGL2 basic vector and used for transfection studies (see Fig. 5). This cloned DNA fragment contains the sequence –1685 to +440 but lacks the sequence between –991 and –885. We also prepared hTRPC1-Pro-Luc expression constructs using PCR method. The DNA fragment that contains the sequence (–1685 to +440) in pCR2.1 vector was PCR-amplified for preparing different hTRPC1-Pro-Luc constructs. The following primers were used for preparing constructs: hTRPC1-Pro-Luc (–1685 to +440), forward, 5′-ATAATAACGCGTGGATAATTGGCAAGC-3′, and reverse 5′-ATAATACTCGAGTCGAGCAGTATACAC-3′; hTRPC1-Pro-Luc (–1685 to +40), forward, 5′-ATAATAACGCGTGGATAATTGGCAAGC-3, and reverse 5′-ATAATACTCGAGAGCTTAGCTCTC-3′; and hTRPC1-Pro-Luc (–1220 to +40), forward 5′-ATAATAACGCGTGCATCTCTCACC-3′, and reverse 5′-ATAATACTCGAGAGCTTAGCTCTC-3′. All three PCR products were double-digested with MluI and XhoI and inserted into PGL2-basic vector. These constructs sequences were verified by sequencing.Fig. 5TNF-α induces hTRPC1 promoter-driven reporter activity. The ability of TNF-α to activate the hTRPC1 promoter was evaluated by transient expression of hTRPC1-Pro-Luc constructs in HMEC. Three different constructs (construct 1, [–1686 to +440]; construct 2 [–1686 to +40]; construct 3, [–1220 to +40]) were used for this study. HMEC grown in 6-well plates were transfected with the hTRPC1-Pro-Luc (1 μg/well) and TK/pRL (0.035 μg/well) reporter plasmids (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated with TNF-α (1000 units/ml) and lysed at indicated times. Firefly and sea pansy luciferase activity was measured (25Ellis C.A. Malik A.B.

We hypothesized that the angiogenic growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), may utilize oxidants that are site-directed to a complex critical to both cytoskeletal and mitogenic signaling. We identified the WASP-family verprolin homologous protein-1 (WAVE1) as a binding partner for the NADPH oxidase adapter p47phox within membrane ruffles of VEGF-stimulated cells. Within 15 min of VEGF stimulation, p47phox coprecipitated with WAVE1, with the ruffle and oxidase agonist Rac1, and with the Rac1 effector PAK1. VEGF also increased p47phox phosphorylation, oxidant production, and ruffle formation, all of which were dependent upon PAK1 kinase activity. The antioxidant Mn (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin and ectopic expression of either the p47-binding WAVE1 domain or the WAVE1-binding p47phox domain decreased VEGF-induced ruffling, whereas the active mutant p4-(S303D, S304D,S328D) stimulated oxidant production and formation of circular dorsal ruffles. Both kinase-dead PAK1-(K298A) and Mn (III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin decreased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by VEGF, whereas dominant-negative JNK did not block ruffle formation, suggesting a bifurcation of mitogenic and cytoskeletal signaling events at or distal to the oxidase but proximal to JNK. Thus, WAVE1 may act as a scaffold to recruit the NADPH oxidase to a complex involved with both cytoskeletal regulation and downstream JNK activation.

However, the relationship between these two processes and the signal pathways leading to these events have not been clearly defined.Reactive oxidants have been linked to both proliferative pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics and thus may present a common mediator of these two facets of growth factor signaling. PDGF, epidermal growth factor, and insulin initiate a small burst of oxidants critical for protein tyrosine phosphorylation, MAPK activation, and DNA synthesis, whereas oxidant scavengers suppress these events (1Bae Y.S.

The use of oxidants is not limited to pathways linked to tyrosine kinase receptors, because smooth muscle NADPH oxidase is activated during the proliferative signaling of both angiotensin II and the ganglioside GD3 (6Bhunia A.K.

High levels of exogenous oxidants increase recruitment of actin to the cytoskeleton, and conversely actin cytoskeletal disruption precipitates oxidant-dependent NF-κβ activation (8Zhao Y. Davis H.W.

Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Oxidant production is also most prominent in actively migrating endothelial cells at the margin of a monolayer wound and, in particular, is concentrated in membrane ruffles of these highly motile cells (10Moldovan L. Moldovan N.I. Sohn R.H. Parikh S.A. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This localization of oxidant production is comparable to that found in phorbol-ester-stimulated neutrophils whose oxidative burst is concentrated within ruffling membranes (11Heyworth P.G. Robinson J.M. Ding J. Ellis B.A. Badwey J.A. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 108: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, we recently found constitutive localization of the NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox to the cytoskeleton of endothelial cells with translocation of p47-GFP to membrane ruffles (12Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).In the present study, we identify the ruffle catalyst WAVE1/suppressor of cAMP receptors as a binding partner of p47phox. Upon stimulation of endothelial cells with VEGF, p47phox associates with WAVE1 as well as with Rac1 and PAK1, proteins involved in both ruffle formation and oxidase activation. p47phox-dependent oxidants appear to mediate VEGF-induced ruffle formation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and JNK activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—Full-length WAVE1 was PCR-amplified from a HUVEC library between exogenous EcoRI and SalI sites and captured in pCR4-Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into pCIneo (pCIN-WAVE1). Full-length WAVE1, WAVE1-(1-442), WAVE1-(1-362), and WAVE1-(1-269) were amplified from pCIN-WAVE1 with the addition of terminal EcoRI and BamHI sites and ligated into the yeast shuttle vector pGADT7. All other WAVE1 truncations were similarly amplified from the original library clone retrieved from the two-hybrid screen and ligated into pGADT7. pCIN-HA was produced by the insertion of a 3× HA tag upstream of the EcoRI site of pCI-neo. WAVE1-(270-559), WAVE1-(1-269), and WAVE1-(100-442) were then subcloned into pCIN-HA with frame correction. WAVE1-(270-442) and p47-(153-286) were PCR-amplified with the addition of terminal EcoRI and SalI sites and ligated into pCIN-HA and pCI-neo, respectively. Gal4-BD-p47 fusions in pGBKT7 were derived as previously described (13Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Gu Y. Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. J. Biol.

WAVE1 was fused to the N terminus of EGFP through amplification of pCIN-WAVE1 with the addition of terminal EcoRI and BamHI sites and removal of the endogenous stop codon and ligation into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech). p47phox was fused to the C terminus of DsRed by ligation of full-length p47phox into the EcoRI site of pDsRed2-C1 (Clontech). HA-JNK1, HA-JNK2, p47-GFP, and pCINF-p47 were previously described (12Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp.

The HA-tagged APF mutants of human JNK1 and JNK2 were a gift of Dr. Lynn Heasley. Actin-GFP was obtained from Clontech. Myc-PAK1-(K298A) was a gift of Dr. Melanie Cobb. All of the PCR reactions were performed with either PfuTurbo (Stratagene) or Pfx Platinum (Invitrogen), and all of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Mating—AH109 yeast (Clontech) were stably transformed with pGBKT7-p47-(1-298) and tested negative for autonomous transactivation. A HUVEC library previously dropped out in pGAL4-AD (13Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Gu Y. Yang Y.S. Yang M.C. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. J. Biol.

Surviving colonies were recloned and retested, and library plasmids were extracted, passaged through Escherichia coli, characterized, and transformed into AH109 yeast. Library plasmid-containing AH109 yeast were mated with bait-containing Y187 yeast, and diploids were plated and assessed for lacZ expression with a filter lift assay. Truncated forms of p47phox and WAVE1 were tested for interaction using a similar yeast mating strategy. Strongly positive interactions caused blue color development within 2 h. Negative interactions remained white for >24 h. Weak positive interactions caused distinct blue coloration between 2 and 24 h.GST Pull Down Assay—BL21-RP E. coli (Stratagene) harboring pGEX-2TK, pGEX-p47, or pGEX-p47-(1-289) were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h, and the soluble proteins were captured on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Full-length or truncated WAVE1 proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro from pCIN-WAVE1 in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TnT Quick Coupled system (Promega). 5 μg of the fusion proteins were incubated with 10 μl of translation mixture for 2 h at 4 °C prior to extensive washing.Adenoviral Construction—Adenoviruses harboring lacZ and p47phox were described previously (12Gu Y.

Sequential site-directed mutations were introduced with PCR to create p47-(S303D,S304D,S328D), which was then subcloned into pShuttle and then pAdX (Clontech). Ad-p47-(W193R) and Ad-p47-(S303D,S304D,S328D) were generated, cloned, and characterized in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Efficiency of transgene expression in HUVEC assessed by lacZ expression was >95%. Expression of p47-wild type, p47-(W193R), and p47-(S303D,S304D,S328D) proteins were equivalent by immunoblot at equal m.o.i.Cell Culture and Microscopy—HUVEC (Clonetics) used in this study were propagated in EGM-2 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, VEGF, insulin growth factor, ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone, heparin, and gentamicin. Transfection was performed after cell synchronization 6-8 h after thymidine release using electroporation with a constant amount of total plasmid DNA. For adenoviral transduction, cells were infected for 1 h at an m.o.i. of 200:1, and harvested 24 h later. For microscopy experiments, cells were plated on fibronectin-coated chambered glass cover-slips and examined live. Prior to VEGF stimulation, cells were serum-starved in medium containing 0.1% fetal calf serum without growth factors for 24 h. For some experiments, cells were treated with 100 μm SOD mimetic MnTBAP (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 37 °C. The number of ruffling cells was counted in all of the actin-GFP-expressing cells in at least ten random fields in at least three separate slides between 15 and 20 min after the addition of VEGF (30 ng/ml, PeproTech). Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV and LSM 410 laser-scanning system. In some experiments, cells were fixed, permeablized, and stained with 5 units of rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) prior to examination (12Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fluorescence ratio imaging was performed using Zeiss LSM software, version 3.98.Immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblot—FLAG-p47-transfected HUVEC were rocked in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2 EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 20 min, harvested, and sonicated once for 3 s. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 10,000 × g prior to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma). Endogenous and adenovirally transduced p47phox were immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-p47phox (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoblots were performed with antibodies against WAVE1 (Upstate Biotechnology), p47phox (Upstate Biotechnology and a gift of Dr. Bernard Babior), PAK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories), and phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechology).p47phox Phosphorylation and Oxidant Production—HUVEC were transfected with pCINF-p47, recovered for 24 h, and then serum-starved for an additional 20 h. Culture medium was replaced with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h. Cells were then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for 15 min, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG, PAGE separation, and autoradiography. A third of the immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted for p47phox to assess capture and loading. Oxidant production was assessed as oxidation of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF, Molecular Probes). HUVEC were washed and loaded with DCF (10 μm) in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 20 min at 37 °C. They were then washed and exposed to VEGF (30 ng/ml for 15 min), and DCF fluorescence was measured as described previously (12Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).JNK and PAK Kinase Assays—Following stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted, and lysed in lysis buffer. HA-JNK or PAK was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-PAK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer. The immunocomplex kinase assay contained either 2 μg of GST-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for JNK or 5 μg of myelin basic protein (Upstate Biotechnology) for PAK as a substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 30 °C for 30 min (13Xu Y.C.

Johnson J.L. McAdara J.K. Benna J.E. Faust L.R. Newburger P.E. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9539-9543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of multiple serines within this C terminus results in the unmasking of these core binding domains. Therefore, we truncated the autoinhibitory C terminus and fused the remaining protein (p47-(1-298)) to Gal4-BD. Upon screening our HUVEC library, a clone representing the C-terminal 459 residues of WAVE1 in-frame with Gal4-AD was recovered. This clone survived auxotrophic and lacZ expression selection and was strongly positive upon retesting using a yeast-mating strategy. In addition, full-length WAVE1 bound robustly to GST-p47-(1-298) in vitro (Fig. 1a), indicating a direct interaction between the two proteins and suggesting the masking of the WAVE1 binding domain by the full-length p47phox protein. The two smaller labeled proteins in the WAVE1 translation reaction are presumably incompletely translated or partially proteolyzed WAVE1 truncations and were not present in reactions not containing the WAVE1 template (data not shown).Using the yeast-mating technique, general binding domains were identified on both proteins. The WAVE1-binding region of p47phox was contained within the central tandem SH3 domains with the N-proximal domain (SH3a) in isolation binding more robustly than the isolated distal (SH3b) domain (Fig. 1c). Both p47-(1-205), containing the N-terminal Phox (PX) and SH3a domains, and p47-(205-390), containing the SH3b domain and C-terminal region, failed to bind WAVE1, presumably because of SH3 surface masking by proline-rich sequences within the adjacent PX and C-terminal regions, respectively. Interestingly, p47-(153-219,Arg-193), containing a Trp→Arg mutation disrupting the SH3a binding surface (12Gu Y. Xu Y.C. Wu R.F. Souza R.F. Nwariaku F.E. Terada L.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15de Mendez I. Homayounpour N. Leto T.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) also bound WAVE1, suggesting a nonconventional mechanism of interaction perhaps unrelated to the SH3a surface.p47phox in turn appeared to bind to the mid-region of WAVE1 (Fig. 1c). Again, the binding mechanism was not easily deduced. Neither residues 1-269 nor 270 -599, which together span the entire protein, bound p47-(1-298). Similarly, neither 1-362 nor 363-559 bound p47-(1-298). An intact proline-rich region (residues 278-442) appeared to be necessary for binding as truncations not containing the full proline-rich region did not bind p47. GST pull down experiments also confirmed the ability of WAVE1-(278-442) and WAVE1-(100-442) to bind p47-(1-298) (Fig. 1d). Curiously, WAVE1-(270-559) bound p47-(1-298) in vitro but not in the yeast two-hybrid system, possibly due to interference with p47 binding by the N-terminal fused Gal4-AD in the WAVE1 truncation of the latter system.VEGF Stimulates Interaction between WAVE1 and p47phox within Membrane Ruffles—As with its myeloid paralog WASP, WAVE1 functionally catalyzes Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation and polymerization (16Westphal R.S. Soderling S.H. Alto N.M. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4589-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and is thus found concentrated within membrane ruffles (17Miki H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In live HUVEC, we found that a DsRed-p47 fusion consistently colocalized with actin-GFP within membrane ruffles following VEGF stimulation, whereas DsRed-p47 was diffusely localized within the cytosol in unstimulated cells (Fig. 2). Specific localization to ruffles was demonstrated by fluorescence ratio imaging of cells cotransfected with DsRed-p47 and free EGFP (Fig. 3, a-c). In addition, the reversal of chromophores using p47-GFP and free DsRed also demonstrated relative concentration of p47phox in membrane ruffles (Fig. 3, d-f). Thus, localization of p47phox to ruffles did not appear to be a function of DsRed itself or of the increased cytosolic volume within ruffles. Interestingly, DsRed-p47 translocated to the nucleus in 15-30% of cells following VEGF stimulation (Fig. 2, d and f). The significance of this finding is unclear at this point but may reflect cotransport of p47phox with other mitogenic or survival factors to the nucleus.Fig. 2Localization of DsRed-p47 to membrane ruffles. HUVEC were cotransfected with DsRed-p47 and actin-GFP and were left unstimulated (a-c) or stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml, panels d-f) for 15-20 min, and fusion proteins observed in situ in living cells. Ruffles appeared as distinctive rapidly moving, sinuous, linear, and dorsally projected actin-GFP-rich structures. In all coexpressing cells, DsRed-p47 colocalized avidly with ruffles (arrow, panel f). Some cells displayed prominent translocation of DsRed-p47 into the nucleus (d). Red (a and d) and green (b and e) channels were imaged sequentially.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Ratio imaging of DsRed-p47 in ruffles. HUVEC were cotransfected with DsRed-p47 and GFP (a-c) or with DsRed and p47-GFP (d-f) and then stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml). Images were taken in live cells. Red/green (c) and green/red (f) ratio images demonstrate relative concentration of DsRed-p47 and p47-GFP, respectively, within VEGF-stimulated ruffles. In contrast, perinuclear accumulation of p47-chromophore fusions appears to be secondary to increased volume of cells imaged in planar sections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition, endogenous WAVE1 coprecipitated with FLAG-p47 and recovery of WAVE1 was maximal at 15 min after stimulation with VEGF (Fig. 4a). This time course coincided with the onset of ruffling activity, which peaked at 10-15 min following VEGF addition, and subsided by 30 min. Furthermore, VEGF also increased coprecipitation of endogenous WAVE1 with endogenous p47phox (Fig. 4b). As expected, spatial colocalization within ruffles of VEGF-stimulated cells was demonstrated using WAVE-GFP and DsRed-p47 (Fig. 5). Colocalization within ruffles was consistent and reproducible with all of the ruffles visualized containing both fusion proteins. Finally, ectopic expression of either the WAVE1 binding domain of p47phox (p47-(153-286)) or the p47 binding domain of WAVE1 (WAVE1-(100-442)) decreased VEGF-induced ruffling (Fig. 6), suggesting that the interaction between WAVE1 and p47phox facilitates such ruffling.Fig. 4Coprecipitation of WAVE1 and FLAG-p47. a, HUVEC transfected with FLAG-p47 were stimulated with VEGF (30 ng/ml) for the indicated times, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or irrelevant isotype control (Irrel), and immunoblotted (IB) for endogenous WAVE1 (upper panel). Coprecipitation of WAVE1 with FLAG-p47 was maximal at 15 min.

The red channel (b, e, and h) was recorded 15-20 s prior to the green channel (a, d, and g) to allow separate filters, thus avoiding bleed-through.

Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6932-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), although the latter protein lacks a functional Cdc42/Rac1-interaction binding domain, suggesting an indirect interaction. We found that within 15 min of VEGF stimulation, endogenous forms of both PAK1 and Rac1 coprecipitated with FLAG-p47 (Fig. 7a). WAVE1 also appeared to be part of the PAK1-p47 complex (Fig. 7b), consistent with the formation of a ternary complex in which WAVE1 and associated protein(s) may act as a scaffold for the recruitment of Rac1, PAK1, and p47phox. Rac1 is an essential subunit of the NADPH oxidase, and PAK1 serves as an effective p47phox kinase in vitro (20Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1995; 269: 221-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), although its capacity to perform this function in intact cells has not been demonstrated. The formation of such a complex might therefore be expected to facilitate p47phox phosphorylation and consequent oxidant production. Indeed, we found that VEGF led to PAK1 activation within 5 min and caused phosphorylation of p47phox within 15 min, whereas kinase-dead dominant-negative (DN) PAK1-(K298A) blocked p47phox phosphorylation (Fig. 8, a-c). This ability of PAK1 to facilitate p47phox phosphorylation, either directly or indirectly, is consistent with recent studies of the NADPH oxidase suggesting that Rac1 activates unknown proximal signaling events leading to oxidase assembly independent from its direct involvement with the oxidase (21Price M.O. Atkinson S.J. Knaus U.G. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19220-19228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In parallel, PAK1-(K298A) also blocked VEGF-induced oxidant production (Fig. 8d) and ruffle formation (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the membrane-permeant SOD mimetic MnTBAP also reduced VEGF-induced ruffling (Fig. 10), suggesting that the effects of endogenous p47phox occurred at least in part through oxidant production. Taken together, these data suggest a linear sequence of complex formation, p47phox phosphorylation, oxidant production, and membrane ruffl"

It is a small protein, with a molecular mass of about 13 kDa, whose function has been the source of considerable debate. SCP-2 belongs to a family of proteins, known as the SCP-2 gene family, that all contain a domain homologous to the sterol carrier protein-2. This gene family includes SCP-2, SCP-X, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV, metallo-β-lactamase, and stomatin (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H.

In vertebrates, SCP-2 and SCP-X share exactly the same nucleotide sequences of SCP-2 domains, because they are transcribed from the same gene (the SCP-2/SCP-X gene). In all cases where the SCP-2 domain is part of a larger protein, the domain is located at the C terminus. Furthermore, the sequence identity among gene family members is very high, suggesting a conserved functional role for this protein (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Interestingly, those enzymes that contain this domain all modify hydrophobic substrates. SCP-2 has been shown to bind to cholesterol, fatty acid, fatty acyl-CoA, and acidic phospholipids (4Frolov A.

Frolov A. Starodub O. Atshaves B.B. Russell W. Petrescu A. Huang H. Gallegos A.M. McIntosh A. Tahotna D. Russell D.H. Billheimer J.T. Baum C.L. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Given this broad specificity and wide spread tissue distribution, it has proved difficult to identify the primary role of this protein (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O.

However, SCP-2 has been shown to accelerate translocation of cholesterol between intracellular membrane structures (7van Noort M. Rommerts F.F. van Amerongen A. Wirtz K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Xu T.S. Bowman E.P. Glass D.B. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12149-12162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Likewise, the biological importance of SCP-2 in cholesterol trafficking was deduced from the knockout mice that show moderately decreased level of cholesterol absorption by intestine and severally reduced bile salt formation (11Fuchs M. Hafer A. Munch C. Kannenberg F. Teichmann S. Scheibner J. Stange E.F. Seedorf U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48058-48065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). SCP-2 is also involved in fatty acid metabolism showing symptoms related to peroxisomal deficiency in SCP-2 knockout mice (12Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W. Wanders R.J. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In addition, SCP-2 may participate in the lipid transport of phosphatidylinositol between intracellular sites and the plasma membrane (13Schroeder F. Zhou M. Swaggerty C.L. Atshaves B.P. Petrescu A.D. Storey S.M. Martin G.G. Huang H. Helmkamp G.M. Ball J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3189-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although there is strong biological evidence for the multifunctional binding of lipids to SCP-2, this has not been demonstrated at the molecular level. For example, SCP-2 extracted from liver does not contain associated cholesterol or any lipid (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14Chanderbhan R. Noland B.J. Scallen T.J. Vahouny G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8928-8934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, how SCP-2 binds to cholesterol or fatty acids in vivo and how it functions as a transporter continues to be a mystery. Homologs of SCP have been found across the animal kingdom including in insects (Fig. 1). The latter are particularly interesting, because insects have lost a number of key enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis pathways (15Zdobnov E.M. von Mering C. Letunic I. Torrents D. Suyama M. Copley R.R. Christophides G.K. Thomasova D. Holt R.A. Subramanian G.M. Mueller H.M. Dimopoulos G. Law J.H. Wells M.A. Birney E. Charlab R. Halpern A.L. Kokoza E. Kraft C.L. Lai Z. Lewis S. Louis C. Barillas-Mury C. Nusskern D. Rubin G.M. Salzberg S.L. Sutton G.G. Topalis P. Wides R. Wincker P. Yandell M. Collins F.H. Ribeiro J. Gelbart W.M. Kafatos F.C. Bork P. Science. 2002; 298: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), which results in complete dependence on exogenous sources of cholesterol for biosynthesis of its steroid derivatives (16Clayton R. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 3-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar-20). This therefore demands that insects must have a mechanism for uptaking, transporting, and storing the cholesterol that is necessary throughout their life cycle. Indeed, insects have the tendency to accumulate cholesterol in the body during feeding stages when their diet is richer in lipids (21Beydon P. Lafont R. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1987; 5: 139-154Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). During that life stage, at least in Manduca sexta, there is a very low rate of cholesterol catabolism (22Jouni Z.E. Zamora J. Wells M.A. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2002; 49: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Intracellular transportation of cholesterol in insects must meet two important biological needs: first the necessity to absorb free cholesterol for the construction of cellular membranes, and second to provide cholesterol as a precursor for the steroid biosynthesis. These two pathways most likely utilize the same intracellular transport protein(s) to mobilize cholesterol. At this time, SCP-2 appears to be a good candidate as a participant in this task. SCP-X has been reported to have high levels of expression in the midgut of Drosophila embryos; however, only a 1.6-kb mRNA transcript arises from this transcript (23Kitamura T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 373-381Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This differs from vertebrates, where the SCP-X/SCP-2 gene combination produces multiple transcripts. In yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti), an independent gene has been identified that is similar to vertebrate SCP-2 (AeSCP-2). This protein also has high levels of expression in the midgut of larvae and high binding affinity for cholesterol (24Krebs K.C. Lan Q. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The in vivo function of insect SCP-2 is unknown. However, because insects do not synthesize cholesterol (25Spates G.E. Deloach J.R. Chen A.C. J. Insect Physiol. 1988; 34: 1055-1061Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), it is hypothesized SCP-2 may be involved in shuttling cholesterol and dietary sterols from lysosomes from which exogenous sterol enters the cell to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. After conversion of dietary sterols to cholesterol or cholesterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol in endoplasmic reticulum, SCP-2 may also be involved in transfer of the cholesterol to the mitochondria for steroid biosynthesis. The lack of peroxisomal localization sequence in the C terminus of AeSCP-2 (24Krebs K.C. Lan Q. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicates that AeSCP-2 may only be involved in absorption and trafficking of cholesterol. This simplicity offers a unique opportunity for studying the sterol/lipid transporting function of the SCP-2 class of proteins. The three-dimensional structures of SCP-2 domain from rabbits and humans have been determined (26Choinowski T. Hauser H. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Garcia F.L. Szyperski T. Dyer J.H. Choinowski T. Seedorf U. Hauser H. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) together with the SCP-2-like domain from the human peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme (28Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These structures contain a unique fold that consists of one layer of antiparallel β-sheet juxtaposed against a layer of α-helices. A large hydrophobic cavity exists between these two layers of secondary structural elements, where it is presumed that cholesterol and fatty acyl derivatives are bound. The size of the cavity is appropriate for either a sterol or fatty acyl derivative. This fold is different from that found in most fatty acid-binding proteins that belong to the lipocalin superfamily and contain a β-clam motif (29Flower D.R. North A.C. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 30Zimmerman A.W. Veerkamp J.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1096-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Although the affinity for lipids is very high, there has only been one detailed structural report of a ligand bound to the SCP-2-like domain of the human multifunctional enzyme (28Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this structure, Triton X-100, which bears some analogy to the protein's normal acyl-Co-A substrates, was observed to bind in a hydrophobic tunnel. Apart from this study, earlier observations by NMR revealed that the hydrophobic cleft is the likely binding site for fatty acyl ligands where the lipid interacts with residues of the first and third helices in SCP-2 (27Garcia F.L. Szyperski T. Dyer J.H. Choinowski T. Seedorf U. Hauser H. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular interaction between SCP-2 and any of its natural ligand(s) is unknown. In an effort to understand of structure and function of class of protein we report here, the structure of SCP-2 from the yellow fever mosquito complexed with a C16 fatty acid to 1.35-Å resolution. This study was initiated in part to expand our understanding of invertebrate members of the SCP-2 superfamily (24Krebs K.C. Lan Q. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) but also because changing the source of a protein is often the best route for obtaining crystals of a ligand complex. As such, this structure provides insight into the manner in which fatty acids bind to this class of proteins. The results also show that there is a high degree of conservation in the three-dimensional structures of invertebrate and vertebrate SCP-2, which implies that the function of SCP-2 is conserved across the animal kingdom. Purification of Recombinant AeSCP-2 Protein—To produce recombinant AeSCP-2 (rAeSCP-2), the PCR product of the entire coding region of the AeSCP-2 gene was cloned into the pGEX-4T-2 GST tag vector (Amersham Biosciences). PCR primers were 5′-gtgaattcgaATGTCTCTGAAGTCCG-3′ (capital letters represent coding sequence; boldface letters represent the start codon; an EcoRI site was incorporated for cloning) and 5′-tactcgagTTACTTCAGCGAGG-3′ (capital letters represent the antisense of coding sequence; boldface letters represent the antisense of the stop codon; a XhoI site was incorporated for cloning). The expression vector was transferred into Escherichia coli strain BL21 under 100 μg/ml ampicillin selection (Amersham Biosciences). Sequence analysis was performed to confirm that the fusion protein was in frame with GST. The rAeSCP-2 expression bacteria were grown in 200 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight, and 50 ml of overnight bacterial culture was added into 500 ml of fresh LB medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C for about 2 h (A 600 = 0.8). Then expression of rAeSCP-2 was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, and the culture was incubated at 18 °C overnight to prevent the formation of inclusion body-bound rAeSCP-2. Cells from 2.5 liters were harvested and resuspended in 30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) with 5 mm dithiothreitol and 2 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed with a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to remove cellular debris. The GST/rAeSCP-2 fusion protein was purified on a GST affinity column (10-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences), and the GST tag was removed by digesting with 500 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) in the column at 22 °C overnight. The use of GST fusion and thrombin cleavage introduces additional residues at the N terminus compared with the wild type protein. Consequently, the amino acid sequence of the protein for the N terminus is Gly-Ser-Pro-Gly-Ile-Arg-Met..., where the methionine indicates the start of the native sequence. The predicted molecular weight of the expression construct (rAeSCP-2) after cleavage is 12,839.90, which was confirmed by mass spectroscopy to be 12,841 (data not shown). Thrombin was removed from eluted rAeSCP-2 by passing through a benzamidine column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified rAeSCP-2 was concentrated in a Centricon YM-10 device (Amicon) to 10 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, stored in phosphate-buffered saline at -80 °C. A typical purification procedure yielded 100 mg of protein from 2.5 liters of cell culture. Prior to crystallization trials, the protein was dialyzed in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) for 20 h against 25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 4 °C. Crystallization of rAeSCP-2—Crystals of ligand-bound rAeSCP-2 were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Typically, 3 μl of rAeSCP-2 protein at 10 mg/ml was combined with an equal volume of 2 m sodium malonate, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Crystals grew as hexagonal plates to a size of 0.6 × 0.6 × 1.5 mm within 5 days. The crystals were very stable at room temperature and retained strong diffraction a year after they were initially prepared. The crystals belonged to space group P212121 and had cell dimensions of a = 29.3 Å, b = 46.1 Å, c = 70.4 Å. Structural Analysis of rAeSCP-2—The x-ray data were collected to 1.35-Å resolution with CuKα radiation at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector equipped with Super long mirrors. The x-ray source was a Rigaku RU200B x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with SAINT and internally scaled with XSCALIBRE. 3I. Rayment and G.

Open table in a new tab Structural Description—The structure of recombinant SCP-2 from the yellow fever mosquito (rAeSCP-2) was determined to 1.35-Å resolution in complex with a 16-carbon fatty acid. The electron density for the polypeptide chain extends almost continuously from Gly-3 to Lys110, where Gly37 and Gly38 are less well ordered than other sections of the polypeptide chain (Fig. 2). The first three visible amino acids, Gly-3, Ile-2, and Arg-1, are a residual from the thrombin cleavage introduced by the GST fusion construct. The first three amino acids in this cloning artifact (Gly-6, Ser-5, and Pro-4) are not well ordered but are present in the crystal lattice on the basis of mass spectroscopic measurements. As shown in Fig. 3, SCP-2 belongs to the α + β tertiary structural classification of proteins where the fold is characteristic of the sterol carrier protein superfamily as defined by structural classification of proteins (35Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The order of secondary structural elements in the protein is as follows: α1-β1-β2-β3-β4-α2-α3-β5-α4. This fold is dominated by a five-stranded β-sheet that exhibits strand order 3-2-1-4-5 with an layer of four α-helices that cover the β-sheet. A large cavity exists at the interface of the layers of α-helices and the β-sheet, which serves as the lipid binding site discussed below. The tertiary structure of mosquito SCP-2 is very similar to that of both human and rabbit SCP-2 (Fig. 4). Indeed, superposition of the coordinates of human protein on the mosquito carrier protein with the program Align (36Cohen G.H. J. Applied Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) reveals that the root mean square difference between 97 structurally equivalent amino acids is only 1.15 Å. Likewise for the protein from rabbit, the root mean square difference is similarly 1.1 Å for 97 equivalent residues. This indicates a remarkable structural similarity between the mammalian and insect proteins in light of their limited sequence identity of approximately ∼30% (Fig. 1). The major structural difference between mosquito SCP-2 and rabbit and human SCP-2 is the loop that coordinates the carboxylate group of the fatty acid in mosquito SCP, which is replaced by an α-helix in the mammalian proteins. The orientation of the final α-helix differs somewhat between these proteins as does the loops that connect. There are also a few small insertions and deletions in the loops that connect β-strands 2 and 3, and β-strands 3 and 4. Lipid Binding Site—As noted above, the arrangement of secondary structural elements creates a large cavity that serves as the lipid binding site. In the structure of rAeSCP-2 described here at 1.35-Å resolution, this cavity contains a saturated 16-carbon fatty acid, which, on the basis of the unequivocal electron density, corresponds to palmitic acid (Fig. 5a). Although the bend in the fatty acid might suggest an unsaturated fatty acid, the separation and position of the centers of mass in the electron density are only consistent with a saturated fatty acid. Furthermore, the distribution of methylene groups is inconsistent with a cis-linkage between any atoms. Finally, the bend occurs after C-10, which precludes oleic acid. The carboxylate group of the fatty acid lies toward the outer opening of the hydrophobic pocket and is sequestered primarily by the loop that connects α-helix-1 to β-strand-1, which is composed of residues Ser18-His28 (Fig. 5b). One oxygen of the carboxylate moiety is coordinated by the side chain of Arg24 and main chain amide hydrogens of Gln25 and Val26. This series of interactions serves to orient the carboxyl group in the binding pocket. The second oxygen is more solvent-exposed but is still hydrogen-bonded to two well defined water molecules. One of these is coordinated to the side chain of Arg15, whereas the second is bound to the main chain oxygens of Asn23 and Asp20, together with the main chain amide hydrogen of Asp20. All of the interactions with the fatty acid carboxylate moiety, both direct and water-mediated, are provided by residues in the first helix and the loop that forms the connection to the first β-strand. It is of interest that the use of arginine residues to coordinate the carboxylate of a fatty acid is a feature common to other fatty acid-binding proteins that exhibit completely different protein folds (37Thompson J. Ory J. Reese-Wagoner A. Banaszak L. Mol Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The acyl chain of the fatty acid extends from the surface of protein deep into the binding pocket. In the first instance, the path of the acyl chain runs approximately parallel to the strands of the β-sheet roughly adjacent to strands 2 and 3. At around atom C-11 the acyl chain bends so that the final atoms of the chain run across the strands of the β-sheet. Coordination of the carboxyl moiety at the outer edge of the binding pocket increases the length of the acyl chain that can be accommodated by this protein. The entire length of the acyl chain is surrounded by hydrophobic residues. Those in direct Van der Waals contact with the lipid include Met71, Ala81, Leu102, Phe105, and Ile99 together with the hydrophobic components of side chains of Arg15 and Arg24. This list represents only a subset of the hydrophobic residues that line the lipid binding cavity as indicated in Fig. 5b. This suggests that the hydrophobic cavity might accommodate a larger ligand such as cholesterol. Structural Comparison with Mammalian SCPs—As noted above, the structure of yellow fever mosquito SCP-2 is exceedingly similar to that of the mammalian structures described earlier. This is perhaps not surprising, since they share the ability to bind and transport sterols. Even so, the percentage of residues that are structurally equivalent is much higher than expected for most homologous proteins that exhibit 30% sequence identity (Fig. 1). Indeed, for a typical group of homologous proteins, only 60% of the residues would be expected to reside in the common core, whereas for the SCP-2 family, ∼90% of the residues lie within 3 Å of their structurally related counterparts (38Chothia C. Lesk A.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). This suggests that the necessity of maintaining a cavity for the transport of lipids has placed restraints on the evolution of this protein fold. Indeed, comparison of the sequences of vertebrate and insect SCP-2s shows that although the exact residue varies on the interior of the cavity, the hydrophobicity is highly conserved (Fig. 1). All of the structures of SCP-2 reported thus far have either been of the apo forms or in the presence of a nonnatural ligand (26Choinowski T. Hauser H. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Garcia F.L. Szyperski T. Dyer J.H. Choinowski T. Seedorf U. Hauser H. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The structural determination reported here is the first to show how a fatty acid might bind in the lipid binding pocket. Interestingly, the secondary structure associated with the coordination of the carboxyl moiety in yellow fever mosquito SCP-2 is different from that in human or rabbit homologs. In the mosquito SCP-2, the coordination site is formed by a loop that connects the first helix with the first β-strand, whereas in both rabbits and humans, this loop is replaced by a short α-helix. The presence of an α-helix at this location demands that the mammalian proteins must coordinate the carboxyl moiety of fatty acids in a different manner from the insect proteins, since this secondary structural element eliminates the binding loop. The only way in which the binding could be maintained in the same manner as the insect protein would be if the α-helix were to unfold to create a binding loop. Although this is unlikely, the number of residues associated with the loop in the insect protein and the helix in the mammalian proteins is similar. Interestingly, the sequence alignment shows that residues appropriate for forming a carboxyl binding pocket are found in each sequence, although they fulfill different structural roles in the mammalian sterol carrier proteins (Fig. 1). The structure of the human SCP-2-like domain from the peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme complexed with the detergent Triton X has been reported (28Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this complex, the tetramethylbutyl-phenyl moiety of the triton molecule is deeply buried within the binding pocket. When the insect and human proteins are superimposed, the phenyl moiety of the Triton-X overlaps with C-11-C-16 of the palmitic acid (Fig. 6). As a consequence, the polyoxyethylene tail of the detergent extends in the opposite direction away from the carboxyl group of the fatty acid and exits the protein at a different portal (only three and a half oxyethylene units are observed in the model). This portal is formed by the triangulation of the fifth β-strand and the immediately preceding and succeeding α-helices. A similar arrangement of secondary structural elements is found in mosquito SCP-2. In the human SCP-2 domain, there is a cluster of exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues that surround the exit portal for the Triton-X polyoxyethylene tail, where the only polar component is provided by a group of glutamine residues (Gln90, Gln108, and Gln111). A similar arrangement is found in the mosquito protein so that although its hydrophobic binding pocket does not extend to the surface at this point, it is conceivable that with minor rearrangements of the helices this portal could exist. The manner in which cholesterol binds to SCP-2 is unknown for any member of this family, although there is unequivocal evidence that these proteins can carry a variety of lipids (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Comparison of the human SCP-2-like domain with the insect protein suggests that the hydrophobic binding cleft may exhibit some flexibility in order to accommodate their ligands. Indeed, a larger cavity volume will certainly be required to accommodate cholesterol in the mosquito protein, since the Van der Waals volume of cholesterol is considerably larger than a C16 fatty acid (350 Å3 compared with 230 Å3 as calculated with the program Atvol (by M. J. Word; available on the World Wide Web at kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/software3.html#atvol). In the same manner, the orientation of cholesterol in the binding pocket is unknown. Although there is precedence for orientation of the polar moiety close to the carboxylate binding loop in the insect protein, the reverse orientation is suggested from the structure of Triton-X bound to the human SCP-2-like domain. As noted earlier, although there is limited sequence similarity between mosquito SCP-2 and mammalian analogs, the structural similarity is remarkable. Given that the structure of rabbit SCP-2 was determined in its apo form and yet there is still a close structural relationship between both mosquito and the human SCP-2-like domain, which are bound to ligand, this suggests that the overall shape of the cavity does not change when lipids are sequestered. Thus, it would appear that, as in other fatty acid-binding proteins, the binding site in SCP-2 is preformed. If this is true, this would favor orientation of cholesterol with its polar moiety toward the carboxylate binding site, since the cavity is broader at that end. This would be in opposition to the human SCP-2-like domain, which utilizes a different exit portal. The overall volume of the cavity is substantial, although it is difficult to obtain a meaningful estimate of the volume due to variability between algorithms and probe parameters (40Chakravarty S. Bhinge A. Varadarajan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31345-31353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is interesting that a C16 fatty acid was incorporated adventitiously into mosquito SCP-2 during its heterologous biosynthesis in E. coli, whereas expression of the mammalian proteins under similar conditions did not lead to incorporation of a hydrophobic ligand. This suggests that either the affinity of this protein for fatty acids is higher than that of its mammalian counterparts or that the manner in which the protein interacts with the cell membrane to load its ligand is different. Conclusions—The results of this study show for the first time how fatty acids bind to SCP-2. Since the fatty acid was incorporated during biosynthesis, this implies that, at least for insect proteins in this family, this might be a natural ligand, as has been implicated by fatty acid-binding studies (2Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As a member of the SCP-2 gene family, SCP-2 is expected to function as an intracellular lipid transporter. AeSCP-2 is the first insect SCP-2 that has been studied in detail (24Krebs K.C. Lan Q. Insect Mol. Biol. 2003; 12: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and although its biological function still unknown, it is likely that SCP-2 plays an important role in lipid metabolism in insects. The three-dimensional structure of rAeSCP-2 is of interest in two aspects. First, rAeSCP-2 has high similarity to vertebrate SCP-2 structurally. Second, rAeSCP-2 is a fatty acid-binding protein and might have a function similar to that of vertebrate SCP-2. A major finding of this study is that the fatty acid in the insect SCP binds in the opposite orientation to Triton X-100 in the human SCP-2-like domain of the multifunctional enzyme (28Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this way, the hydrophobic moieties of these lipids are oriented at opposite ends of the molecule. This suggests that these proteins may exhibit multiple binding modes for their ligands, depending on the nature of the lipid. Further experimental studies to examine this problem are in progress.

https://openalex.org/W1973487236,"Several growth factors have been suggested to play a crucial role in liver regeneration, but a functional proof is still missing. Since fibroblast growth factors are important for the initiation of mammalian liver development, we determined the roles of these mitogens in liver repair by targeted expression of a dominant-negative fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) in hepatocytes of transgenic mice. The liver of young animals appeared histologically normal, and liver function was not obviously impaired. In aged transgenic mice, the frequency of fatty liver development was strongly increased compared to control animals. Following partial hepatectomy, transgenic mice showed markedly reduced hepatocyte proliferation because of an arrest in the late G(1) phase of the cell cycle. These data demonstrate a key role of FGFR signalling in repair after liver injury."

Among these, a specific protein kinase that phosphorylates Ser60, Ser59, or Ser58 of 14-3-3β, 14-3-3η, or 14-3-3ζ, respectively, was termed “sphingosine-dependent protein kinase-1” (SDK1) (Megidish, T., Cooper, J., Zhang, L., Fu, H., and Hakomori, S. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 21834–21845). We have now identified SDK1 as a protein having the C-terminal half kinase domain of protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) based on the following observations. (i) Large-scale preparation and purification of proteins showing SDK1 activity from rat liver (by six steps of chromatography) gave a final fraction with an enhanced level of an ∼40-kDa protein band. This fraction had SDK1 activity ∼50,000-fold higher than that in the initial extract. (ii) This protein had ∼53% sequence identity to the Ser/Thr kinase domain of PKCδ based on peptide mapping using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry data. (iii) A search for amino acid homology based on the BLAST algorithm indicated that the only protein with high homology to the ∼40-kDa band is the kinase domain of PKCδ. The kinase activity of PKCδ did not depend on Sph or DMS; rather, it was inhibited by these sphingoid bases, i.e. PKCδ did not display any SDK1 activity. However, strong SDK1 activity became detectable when PKCδ was incubated with caspase-3, which releases the ∼40-kDa kinase domain. PKCδ and SDK1 showed different lipid requirements and substrate specificity, although both kinase activities were inhibited by common PKC inhibitors. The high susceptibility of SDK1 to Sph and DMS accounts for their important modulatory role in signal transduction.

However, we found previously that several proteins acting as chaperones of key signal transducers or as modulators of endoplasmic reticulum protein function are phosphorylated only in the presence of Sph or DMS, but not Cer or Sph-1-P (16Megidish T.

Such Sph- or DMS-dependent factors are as follows: (i) a protein kinase involved in phosphorylation of 14-3-3 at defined phosphorylation sites (Ser60 in 14-3-3β, Ser59 in 14-3-3η, and Ser58 in 14-3-3ζ), termed “sphingosine-dependent protein kinase-1” (SDK1) (16Megidish T.

The chaperone or modulatory protein 14-3-3 has received increasing attention for its interaction with and functional modification of various key molecules involved in signal transduction, transport, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (18Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). SDK1 specifically phosphorylates 14-3-3β, 14-3-3η, and 14-3-3ζ only in the presence of Sph and DMS, but not 16 other lipids tested (including Cer and Sph-1-P). The phosphorylation takes place at Ser60, Ser59, or Ser58, located in helix 3, which may interfere with interaction between two molecules of 14-3-3 to form a dimer. Non-phosphorylated 14-3-3 prefers to form a dimer and may function as a chaperone or modulator of major signal transducers such as Raf1, Bad, and Ber. SDK1-dependent phosphorylation may counteract this effect and thereby modulate signal transduction to induce cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. However, the molecular identity and biochemical properties of SDK1 have not yet been clearly elucidated. Here, we describe the characterization of SDK1 and identify it as the C-terminal half kinase domain of PKCδ, distinguishable from PKCδ per se. Frozen rat livers (from 7–8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats, both genders) were purchased from Pel-Freez Biologicals (Rogers, AR) and used as a source for large-scale preparation of SDK1.

Specific column contents for HPLC were from Amersham Biosciences, except for heparin-Sepharose, which was prepared in the laboratory of Dr. Kazuo Fujikawa (Department of Biochemistry, University of Washington). HPLC with Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, and chromatofocusing was performed in a HPLC Fast Flow assembly (Amersham Biosciences).

The control peptide (17 amino acids) with the sequence Ac-YGGSAESS(Aib)KSEASSK(Aib)SA-CONH2) was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Tomikazu Sasaki (Department of Chemistry, University of Washington) and kindly donated to us. 150 g of rat liver at one time was thawed, cut into small pieces, and homogenized in a Waring blender (30 s at high speed, three times) in ice in a cold room with 1000 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 12 mm NaF, 5% glycerol, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) (pH 8.0). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm in Beckman centrifuge. The supernatant was adjusted to pH 8.0 and ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.5-μm filter and used for six steps of chromatographic purification, guided by SDK1 activity. Step 1: Q-Sepharose Fast Flow Chromatography—The pH of the filtered extract described above was adjusted to 8.0 and applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow XK 26/20 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm DTT (pH 8.0)) as described previously (16Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Elution was performed by a combination of stepwise and linear gradient changes of the NaCl concentration (0–1.0 m) under conditions of 4 ml/min and 8 ml/fraction. 10 μl of each fraction was analyzed for SDK1 activity using 14-3-3β as substrate (see below). The activity was consistently found between fractions 22 and 31 (see Fig. 1A). Step 2: Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography—Fractions showing SDK1 activity from Step 1 were pooled, added with powdered KCl to give a final concentration of 1 m, filtered through a 0.5-μm membrane, and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). All SDK1 activity was recovered in the flow-through fraction with increased specific activity (see “Results”). Step 3: Cation-exchange Chromatography on a Heparin-Sepharose Column—The flow-through fraction (15 ml) from Step 2 was subjected to buffer exchange by pass-through a HiPrep 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 2 column volumes (100 ml) of 50 mm MES (pH 6.7), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF. Proteins were eluted with 15–20 ml of MES buffer prior to elution of KCl. The buffer-exchanged sample was applied to a heparin column pre-equilibrated with the same MES buffer and subjected to gradient elution with the same buffer containing increasing NaCl concentrations under conditions of 1.5 ml/min and 4.5 ml/fraction. High SDK1 activity was consistently found between fractions 15 and 21 (see Fig. 1B). Step 4: Hydroxylapatite Chromatography—The fraction with SDK1 activity resulting from Step 3 was buffer-exchanged to 10 mm KH2PO4. Elution was performed with increasing KH2PO4 concentrations under conditions of 1.0 ml/min and 2 ml/fraction. Peak SDK1 activity was observed between fractions 10 and 20 (see Fig. 1C). Step 5: Chromatofocusing—The SDK1 active fraction from Step 4 was buffer-exchanged to 25 mm BisTris (pH 7.3), applied to a Mono P HR 5/20 column (4-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences), and subjected to gradient elution with Polybuffer 74 (pH 4.3) (Amersham Biosciences) under conditions of 0.5 ml/min and 2 ml/fraction. Peak SDK1 activity was observed between fractions 16 and 18 (see Fig. 1D). Step 6: Mono Q Chromatography—The SDK1 active fraction from Step 5 was buffer-exchanged to Buffer A (pH 8.0), placed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (1-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A, and subjected to gradient elution with 0.15–0.5 m NaCl under conditions of 0.25 ml/min and 0.5 ml/fraction. High SDK1 activity was observed in fractions 17–21; the maximal peak was in fraction 18, 19, or 20 depending on the sample (in one case, shown in Fig. 1E, the peak was in fraction 20). A band with molecular mass of ∼40 kDa was detected in the SDK1 active fractions. This band, separated by SDS-PAGE, was therefore subjected directly to sequence analysis after in-gel digestion. Step 7: Size-exclusion Chromatography—The SDK1 active fraction from Step 6 was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to eliminate impurities, subjected to gel filtration through a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (24-ml bed volume; Amersham Biosciences), and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 0.15 m NaCl under conditions of 500 μl/min and 500 μl/fraction. PKCδ activity with the common PKC peptide substrate RFARKGS LRQKNV (where S denotes the phosphorylation site; Panvera Corp.) was determined by incubating the following mixture (50-μl total volume): 2 μl of 0.5 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 5 μl of 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 μl of 100 μm peptide substrate, 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 6.7 μl of 750 μm ATP, 5 μl 10× lipid mixture (2 mg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS), 200 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.3% Triton X-100), and 5 μl containing 25 ng of PKCδ in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm DTT, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting 25 μl of this mixture onto phosphocellulose membrane (P-81 paper, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The membranes were washed three to five times with 0.5% phosphoric acid and counted in a scintillation counter. PKCδ activity was quantified as the amount of 32P-phosphorylated peptide trapped on the membrane as measured in the scintillation counter. This was performed by a modification of the previously described method (16Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Megidish T. Hamaguchi A. Iwabuchi K. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including quantitative comparison of activities using a PhosphorImager (Cyclone storage phosphor screen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Briefly, 10 μl of sample solution, i.e. aliquot of the chromatographic fraction, was mixed with 3 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing 1 μg of 14-3-3β (1 μl of a 1 μg/μl solution) and 0.15 μl of 10 mm DMS in Me2SO (final DMS concentration of 50 μm in the incubation mixture). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μl of ATP/Mg2+ solution (75 μm unlabeled ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm DTT, and 45 mm MgAc) and H2O to adjust the total volume to 30 μl. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of 4× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer and heating for 3 min at 100 °C. Phosphorylated 14-3-3β was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was air-dried, and the activity of phosphorylated 14-3-3β band was determined by contact of the membrane with the screen of the PhosphorImager. The intensities of each band were quantified by OptiQuant software, subtracted by the value for a control 14C marker, and compared in terms of digital light units. PKCδ was incubated with caspase-3 as described previously (20Denning M.F. Wang Y. Tibudan S. Alkan S. Nickoloff B.J. Qin J.-Z. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 ng of human recombinant PKCδ was added to the following mixture with a total reaction volume of 20 μl: 2 units of active human recombinant caspase-3 in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm DTT. Cleavage was confirmed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus of PKCδ. For SDK1 activity determination of caspase-3-treated PKCδ, 8.5 μlof the above mixture (containing 85 ng of caspase-3-treated PKCδ) or of untreated full-length PKCδ was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 1 μg of 14-3-3β, 50 μm DMS (at a final solvent concentration of 1% ethanol and 0.05 m NaCl), 3 mm DTT, 25 μm ATP, 45 mm MgAc, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 26.7 mm Tris (pH 7.3) at a final volume of 30 μl. Controls were carried out in the absence of DMS. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer (4× concentrated) and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. 14-3-3 phosphorylation was analyzed by 10–12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were subjected to autoradiography using an intensifier screen (exposure time of 2 h at –80 °C) or a PhosphorImager. In some reactions, 5–150 μm rottlerin (Calbiochem) or 1–10 μm GF109203X (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) was used as a PKCδ inhibitor. Other lipids (Sph-1-P, C2-Cer, and C16-Cer) were also tested to verify SDK1 activity. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE—500 μl of fraction 18, associated with very high SDK1 activity from Step 6 (Mono Q), was precipitated with an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, washed with 1 ml of cold ethyl ether, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Washing with cold ethyl ether was repeated three times to eliminate trichloroacetic acid. The final precipitate was dissolved in 10 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue). The resulting mixture was loaded onto a gel and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The conditions were as follows: gel size of 130 × 130 × 1 mm; 4 and 10% acrylamide containing 2.6% piperazine diacrylamide/acrylamide (Bio-Rad) for the stacking and running gels, respectively; and running buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine (pH 8.45) containing 0.1% SDS. Proteins were concentrated at 5 mA/gel for 70 min in stacking gel and run at 20 mA/gel for 2 h. Gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-350 (Bio-Rad) dissolved in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol and washed with 7% acetic acid and 30% methanol for 20 min (three times) and with 10% acetic acid for 20 min (three times). The protein profile was analyzed by a Master Scan image analyzer (Scanlytics, Billerica, MA). Molecular masses of bands were calculated based on molecular mass standard proteins (broad-range; Bio-Rad). In-gel Digestion with Trypsin and Extracted Peptides—The ∼40-kDa band was subject to in-gel digestion as described previously (21Mineki R. Taka H. Fujimura T. Kikkawa M. Shindo N. Murayama K. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1672-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, the band was excised manually using a razor blade, placed in an Eppendorf tube, washed with H2O (10 min, 37 °C, five times), and destained in 100 μl of 50% CH3CN and 100 mm ammonium carbonate (pH 8.5) for 10 min at 37 °C until colorless. The gel was dehydrated in 100 μl of CH3CN in an Eppendorf tube for 10 min at 37 °C and dried in Speed-Vac™ for 5 min. The dried residue was immersed in 50 μl of 0.001% trypsin (10 ng/μl) in 100 mm ammonium carbonate (pH 8.5) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The original trypsin solution was 20 μg/20 μl of 50 mm acetic acid. The incubation mixture in the Eppendorf tube was centrifuged, and the residue was extracted with 50% CH3CN and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged again. The residue was further extracted with 15% isopropyl alcohol, 20% formic acid, 25% CH3CN, and 40% H2O and finally with 80% CH3CN. All of the extracts were successively dried in a single Eppendorf tube, and the residue was dissolved in 6 μl of ultrapure water. Aliquots (2 μl) were used for protein identification and for amino acid sequencing by mass spectrometry (MS). Peptide Sequencing—Peptide mapping was performed using the API QSTAR pulsar hybrid mass spectrometer system with a micro-liquid chromatograph (Magic 2002, Michrom BioResource, Auburn, CA). Conditions of micro-LC were as follows: Magic C18 column (0.2 mm, inner diameter × 50 mm) and elution with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in 90% CH3CN (solvent B) using a program of 3% solvent B for 2 min, gradient at 2.1%/min for 45 min, 100% solvent B for 5 min, and a flow rate of 2.5 μl/min. The QSTAR pulsar hybrid mass spectrometer system consists of nanoelectrospray ionization as the ionization source and quadrupole time-of-flight MS. Mass accuracy was ±0.1 mass unit. Conditions of MS were as follows: ion spray voltage of 3.0–3.8 kV, voltage for the electron multiplier of 2200 V, nitrogen 10 curtain gas for MS and MS/MS analyses, and nitrogen 10 collision gas and collision energy of 20–55 eV for MS/MS analysis. Conditions of micro-LC were as follows: Magic C18 column (0.2 mm, inner diameter × 50 mm), elution with solvent A and solvent B using a program of 3% solvent B for 2 min, gradient at 2.1%/min for 45 min, 100% solvent B for 5 min, and a flow rate of 2.5 μl/min. To identify protein in the ∼40-kDa band, peptide mapping of one-third of the in-gel digested product was performed by micro-LC/MS (QSTAR) using the PROWL (ProFound) search engine 2Available at prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin.ProFound. and the NCBI Database (22Graves P.R. Haystead T.A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 39-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 23Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The major ion peaks of the total ion chromatogram were further analyzed to obtain the amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides by LC/MS/MS using the Mascot search engine (22Graves P.R.

LCQ-DECA XP (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) with a Magic micro-liquid chromatograph was also used for determination of the amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides using the MS/MS mode (one-third of the sample used). The conditions of MS were as follows: ion spray voltage of 1.8 kV, transfer tube temperature of 250 °C for MS and MS/MS analyses, helium collision gas, and normalized collision energy of 35% for MS/MS analysis. Identification of probable sequences from MS/MS data was performed using the TurboSequest search engine (22Graves P.R. Haystead T.A.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 39-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 26Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc.

Aliquots of the caspase-3-released kinase domain from 85 ng of PKCδ were incubated (5 min, 30 °C) with various concentrations of the 14-3-3 icosapeptide, previously identified as the SDK1-dependent phosphorylation site, or of the unrelated control peptide (17 amino acids) with the sequence described under “Materials.” The incubation mixture was assayed for SDK1 activity with 14-3-3β as substrate, DMS as activator, and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by determination of phosphorylated 14-3-3β separated by SDS-PAGE as described above. Purification of Proteins with SDK1 Activity—The results of the chromatography steps (Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, heparin-Sepharose, hydroxylapatite, chromatofocusing, Mono Q, and gel filtration pattern of the fraction obtained by Mono Q) are shown in Fig. 1 (A–F, respectively). The results of purification by phenyl-Sepharose (Step 2) are essentially the same as described previously (16Megidish T. Cooper J. Zhang L. Fu H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21834-21845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and therefore are not shown. The SDK1 activity of each fraction at each chromatography step, expressed as digital light units, is also indicated in each panel of Fig. 1. The yield of proteins, their SDK1 activities, specific activities (SDK1 activity/mg of protein), and -fold purification are shown in Table I. An ∼55,000-fold purification was obtained at the Mono Q step in comparison with the initial extract; specific SDK1 activity was increased to a similar degree. However, a large number of protein bands were still present, separated by SDS-PAGE, even at the Mono Q step. Perhaps some of these proteins were present as complexes and were extremely difficult to separate into components, even after many chromatography steps. Further separation was achieved only by SDS-PAGE, whereby SDK1 activity was lost because of denaturation.Table IProtein quantity, total SDK1 activity, and specific SDK1 activity at various steps of purificationStepProteinVolumeTotal SDK1 activityaExpressed as digital light units (DLU) from PhosphorImager analysis (see “Determination of SDK1 Activity in Chromatographic Fractions from Rat Liver”).Specific SDK1 activityYieldPurificationmgmlDLUDLU/mg protein%fold0.

Open table in a new tab The chromatographic fractions showing the highest SDK1 activity on the Mono Q column (fraction 18, 19, or 20, depending on the batch) showed a band with a molecular mass ∼40 kDa upon SDS-PAGE, which was absent in other fractions with no or minimal SDK1 activity. Therefore, amino acid sequence analysis was performed for this band as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ∼40-kDa Protein from a Fraction Containing SDK1 Activity Has the Same Sequence Found in the C-terminal Half Domain of PKCδ—Based on procedures described above, the in-gel digested product of the ∼40-kDa band was analyzed by micro-LC/MS and MS/MS combined with QSTAR or LCQ-DECA XP, and the probable peptide sequence was studied using three online search engines (PROWL, Mascot, and TurboSequest) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The probable sequences of peptide fragments as determined by these three methods are indicated in Table II. The overlap from the three methods confirms the reality of a common sequence as shown in Table III. The sequence so far determined covered ∼53% of that of the C-terminal half domain ("
https://openalex.org/W2057135006,"In the course of an effort to identify unknown targets genes for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) by PCR, the gene for ATP citrate-lyase was determined to be one such gene. (Sato, R., Okamoto, A., Inoue, J., Miyamoto, W., Sakai, Y., Emoto, N., Shimano, H., and Maeda, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 12497–12502). We here report that gene expression of sterol Δ8-isomerase (SI), which catalyzes the conversion of the 8-ene isomer into the 7-ene isomer in the last steps of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, is regulated by SREBPs, mainly by SREBP-2. Luciferase assays using the promoter of the human SI gene revealed that a 200-base pair segment upstream region from the transcription start site contains functional elements required for the activity of the SREBPs, Sp1 and NF-Y. Interestingly, SI gene expression was well regulated by sterols in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, in contrast with HEK293 and HeLa cells. Overexpression of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 in HEK293 cells augmented expression of SREBP-responsive genes including the SI gene, whereas inactivation of HNF-4 by small interfering RNAs in HepG2 cells reduced the SI gene promoter activity. The in vitro pull-down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed the direct interaction between SREBP-2 and HNF-4. These data provide a novel pathway by which HNF-4 potentiates the SREBP functions and stimulates expression of SREBP-responsive genes in enterohepatic cells. In the course of an effort to identify unknown targets genes for sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) by PCR, the gene for ATP citrate-lyase was determined to be one such gene.

SREBPs 1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; SI, sterol Δ8-isomerase; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein; SI, sterol Δ8-isomerase; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HMG, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP response element binding protein. are synthesized as membrane-bound precursor proteins. As long as intracellular sterol concentrations are sufficient, SREBPs remain bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope. Upon sterol deprivation, the NH2-terminal portion containing the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain is cleaved by a two-step process that occurs mainly in the Golgi apparatus (1Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The mature SREBPs are then transported into the nucleus in a β-importin-dependent manner (2Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 7: 2221-2233Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and stimulate the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. The SREBP family comprises three subtypes: SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c, which are derived from a single gene by alternative promoters and splicing, and SREBP-2, which is derived from a different gene. In addition to the sterol regulatory cleavage system, rapid degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and another post-translational modification, sumoylation, also regulate SREBP activity in the nucleus (3Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36431-36437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Hirano Y. Murata S. Tanaka K. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16809-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All of the data reported so far support the notion that SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 mainly regulate the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol metabolism, respectively, whereas SREBP-1a regulates both (5Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S.

Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a is the more potent activator of transcription than SREBP-1c because of a more extensive transactivation region but is expressed at a much lower level than SREBP-1c in most organs. We have identified several SREBP-responsive genes by a PCR subtraction method using a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (CHO-487) expressing a nuclear form of human SREBP-1a with a LacSwitch inducible mammalian expression system (8Sato R. Okamoto A. Inoue J. Miyamoto W. Sakai Y. Emoto N. Shimano H. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12497-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The benefit of this cell line is that it affords a higher induction of target genes, which is a crucial feature so as not to overlook any candidates, rather than a CHO cell line expressing SREBP-1c, which does not afford such a high induction level. Furthermore, the inducible genes in this cell line likely include those that are SREBP-2-responsive. Through this method we have detected SREBP-responsive genes such as the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA synthase and the stearoyl CoA desaturase-1 genes and further the ATP-citrate lyase gene (8Sato R.

We also detected insulin-inducing gene-1, which was recently demonstrated to be a novel SCAP-binding protein regulating the proteolytic activation of SREBPs (9Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E.

In the course of screening for SREBP-responsive genes, we have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the human SI gene. Cholesterol biosynthesis in mammals requires more than 30 enzymes, and most of this enzymatic activity is under sterol-mediated feedback control (11Sakakura Y. Shimano H. Sone H. Takahashi A. Inoue K. Toyoshima H. Suzuki S. Yamada N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In the later stage of this pathway, SI catalyzes the conversion of the 8-ene isomer into the 7-ene isomer. In addition to its role in sterol isomerization, SI also functions as a multidrug-binding protein for various drugs, including the Ca2+ antagonist emopamil, the immunosuppressant SR31747A, and the antiestrogen tamoxifen (12Hanner M.

Furthermore, recent genetic analyses revealed that mutations in the SI gene cause X-linked dominant Conradi-Hünermann syndrome in humans and Tattered in mice, which is one of the disorders with aberrant punctate calcification in cartilage or chondrodysplasia punctata (16Derry J.M.-J.

Clinical and biochemical data on the Conradi-Hünermann syndrome patients show an accumulation of 8(9)-cholesterol and 8-dehydrocholesterol in plasma because of a defect at C8-C7 (8-ene–7-ene) isomerization. Although SI is an important enzyme possessing unique features in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, to date little is known about its regulation. A lone previous paper has addressed the sterol-mediated regulation of SI mRNA levels (18Bae S.-H. Seong J. Paik Y.-K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 689-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the SI gene promoter, like other SREBP-responsive genes, contains a cluster of essential responsive elements for SREBPs, Sp1 and NF-Y. Interestingly, the promoter responds well to sterol depletion in HepG2 cells but not in HEK293 cells, and overexpression of HNF-4 in HEK293 cells improves the responsiveness. Various reporter assays reveal that co-expression of SREBP-2 and HNF-4 synergistically stimulates luciferase gene transcription driven by the promoters of several SREBP-responsive genes including the SI gene. Moreover, it is confirmed that HNF-4 is able to interact with SREBP-2. Our findings provide new insights into the complex network between the SREBPs and nuclear receptors that regulate lipid homeostasis. Materials—Cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol and lipoprotein-deficient serum were purchased from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Northern Blot Analysis—The stable CHO cell lines, CHO-Lac expressing the Lac repressor, CHO-487 expressing a nuclear form of human SREBP-1a, and CHO-481 expressing a nuclear form of human SREBP-2 were described previously (3Hirano Y.

HepG2, Caco-2, and HEK293 cells were set up on day 0 in medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum. On day 1, the medium was removed, and the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed with medium A containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum supplemented either with 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol plus 10 μg/ml cholesterol (the sterol-loaded conditions) or with a 50 μm concentration of a HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) plus 50 μm sodium mevalonate (the sterol-depleted conditions). After 48 h of culture, total RNA was extracted, and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (3Hirano Y. Yoshida M. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

Transgenic Mice Study—Transgenic mice were as described previously (5Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

The animals of each group (n = 3) were fed a high protein/low carbohydrate diet for 2 weeks and fasted overnight prior to sacrifice. An equal aliquot of liver total RNA was pooled (15 μg) and subjected to Northern blot analysis with cDNA probes for human SI. The resulting bands were quantified by exposure to the filters of a BAS2000 with BAStation software (Fuji Photo Film, Co., Ltd.), and the results were normalized to the signal generated from 36B4 mRNA. Construction of Plasmids—To generate constructs of human HNF-4α2 (pHNF4 and pFLAGHNF4), a 1.5-kilobase pair EcoRI-NotI fragment obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from HepG2 was ligated into a pME18S vector (20Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T. Takano T. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26461-26464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) or p3XFLAG-CMV-7.1 (Sigma). An expression plasmid pGal4-SREBP2 was constructed by inserting the fragment for amino acid 2–481 of SREBP-2 into the expression plasmid pm-His, which was engineered from a pm vector (Clontech) to contain an in-frame NH2-terminal His epitope tag (MRGS(H)6). To generate siRNA expression constructs, pSiHNF4 and pSi, one of the 19-bp fragments (5′-CCCTCGTCGACATGGACAT-3′ for human HNF-4α2 and 5′-AGGGAGGGCCATGTCCCTA-3′ as an unrelated control, respectively) was inserted into pSilencer1.0-U6 (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of the Reporter Genes for Luciferase Assays—The luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by cloning the BglII-HindIII PCR fragments coding the 5′-flanking region of human SI gene into the same restriction sites of a pGL3 basic vector (Promega). To generate pSI-2000, pSI-300, pSI-203, pSI-169, and pSI-93, PCR primers were designed to hybridize at the corresponding position (see Fig. 2) and were coupled with the common downstream primer from nucleotide +68. All of the mutant reporter constructs were synthesized by a PCR-assisted method using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the mutant SRE sites were replaced by a NotI sequence (GCGGCCGC), and both a GC site and the CCAAT boxes were replaced by an EcoRI sequence (GAATTC). To generate the pG5Luc reporter plasmid, five copies of Gal4-binding sites in the pG5CAT (Clontech) were transferred to pGL3-Basic (Promega). Reporter Assays—Reporter assays were performed as described previously (19Nakahara M. Fujii H. Maloney P.R. Shimizu M. Sato R. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of the indicated reporter construct and 0.01 μg of pRL-CMV, an expression plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (Promega). HepG2 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the indicated reporter construct and 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV and then cultured under either the sterol-depleted or sterol-loaded conditions. After incubation for 48 h, the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter system (Promega) was used to determine luciferase activity. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—A 32P-labeled probe (5′-AAAATCACCCCACTGC-3′) corresponding to the SRE of the human low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene was incubated with 1.7 μg of recombinant SREBP-2 (1–481) for 20 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (12.5 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 6 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml nonfat dry milk, 50 μg/ml sodium poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 5% (v/v) glycerol). In competition assays, an excess amount of an unlabeled 16-bp fragment for wild type or mutant SREs in the human SI promoter was added prior to addition of the labeled probe. Recombinant SREBP-2 (1–481) containing six consecutive histidines were expressed using a pET28 vector (Novagen) in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity chromatography (Qiagen). Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—To generate a glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression construct (pGEX6PSBP2), the fragment for amino acid 1–481 of SREBP-2 was ligated into pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein, GST-SREBP2 (1–481), and GST were expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) beads following the manufacturer's instructions. Using the TNT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega), 35S-labeled HNF-4 was synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol. 25 μl of either GST- or the GST fusion protein-coupled resin, 10 μl of the in vitro translation reaction, and 300 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The reactions were washed five times with 500 μl of buffer, and the specifically bound proteins were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To confirm the in vivo interaction between SREBP-2 and HNF-4, HEK293 cells were transfected with pFLAGHNF4, an expression construct for GST-SREBP2 (2–481), and pGSTSREBP2 (2–481; Ref. 4Hirano Y.

Alternatively, the immunoprecipitates with anti-HNF-4 antibodies (H-171, Santa Cruz) from the nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells cultured under the sterol-depleted conditions were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-SREBP-2 antibodies RS004 (21Sato R.

SREBP-2 Preferentially Regulates the SI Gene Expression— Through a PCR subtraction method we obtained several PCR fragments induced by SREBP-1a including fatty acid synthase, HMG CoA synthase, and ATP citrate lyase cDNA (8Sato R.

One of these fragments was found to have a 90% homology with human phenylalkylamine Ca2+ antagonist-binding protein (emopamil-binding protein), which recently turned out to be identical to SI, an essential enzyme of the sterol biosynthesis pathway (12Hanner M.

Northern blot analyses revealed that expression of SI mRNA was up-regulated 4-fold in response to sterol depletion in human hepatoma cells, HepG2 cells (data not shown). To assess which subtype of SREBPs, SREBP-1a or SREBP-2, preferentially regulates SI gene expression, Northern blot analysis was performed using total RNA from stable CHO cell lines, CHO-487 and CHO-481, expressing a mature form of either human SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 with a LacSwitch inducible mammalian expression system, respectively. These stable cells were cultured with sterols to suppress the activation of endogenous SREBPs and with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce expression of exogenous SREBPs. Fig. 1A shows that the induction of SREBP-1-responsive gene, fatty acid synthase, was significantly higher in CHO-487 cells, whereas a remarkable increase in squalene synthase, an SREBP-2 responsive gene (22Pai J. Guryev O. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26138-26148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 23Guan G. Dai P.-H. Osborne T.F. Kim J.B. Shechter I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10295-10302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was observed in CHO-481. Expression of SI mRNA was induced more in CHO-487 cells, suggesting that SREBP-2 preferentially regulates SI gene expression. Further evidence was provided by Northern blot analyses using total RNA in the livers of SREBP-1a (TgBP-1a), SREBP-1c (TgBP-1c), and SREBP-2 transgenic (TgBP-2) mice. The highest expression of mRNA for SI was observed in TgBP-2 mice, which expressed a mature form of human SREBP-2 (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data suggest it is likely that SREBP-2 is a major regulator of the expression of the SI gene, although it was originally found to be one of SREBP-1-responsive genes in the current experiment. Human SI Promoter Sequence—To study the direct effect of SREBP-2 on transcription, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human SI gene. After we cloned a 2-kb fragment, the nucleotide sequence around the SI gene (AF196972) was submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank. The sequence in Fig. 2 (accession number AB103460) has a 99.7% homology with AF196972, and no mismatch was observed in the region -300 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The nucleotide start site was determined by 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of the SI mRNA. The 5′ end of the longest clone (three of nine clones) is numbered +1. The -300-bp region contains six potential SRE-like motifs, three CCAAT boxes (CAT1, CAT2, and CAT3), and a GC box, which are present as a cluster in the promoter region of most SREBP-responsive genes for coordinate regulation of the genes by SREBPs and one of the ubiquitous transcription factors, NF-Y and Sp1 (8Sato R.

(Tokyo). 1998; 123: 1191-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sterol-mediated Transcriptional Regulation of the SI Gene—To determine whether SREBP-2 directly regulates the transcription of the SI gene, we carried out luciferase assays using reporter genes including various versions of the human SI 5′-flanking region. HepG2 cells were transfected with each reporter gene and cultured under either sterol-loaded or -depleted conditions for 2 days. As long as the reporter gene contained the segment from -203 to +68 bp, sterol depletion resulted in an increase in luciferase activities more than 6-fold (Fig. 3). Otherwise, in the absence of this segment, the reporter gene pSI93 no longer responded to sterol depletion, suggesting that the segment from 300 to 94, at least, contains functionally essential elements required for the SREBP-dependent regulation of the SI gene expression. The Elements Responsible for the Sterol-mediated Regulation—The promoters analyzed thus far in sterol-regulated genes contain NF-Y or Sp1 sites adjacent to SREs, and these co-factors have been shown to be indispensable for SREBP-dependent regulation (8Sato R. Okamoto A. Inoue J. Miyamoto W. Sakai Y. Emoto N. Shimano H. Maeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12497-12502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Sato R. Inoue J.

Fig. 4A shows that mutation of either the GC box (GCKO) or the CAT2 sequence (CAT2KO) caused a significant reduction of the response to sterol depletion, and a modest reduction was also observed by mutation in the CAT3 sequence (CAT3KO). This suggests that both the Sp1 site (GC) and the NF-Y site (CAT2) are crucially involved in sterol-mediated induction of the SI promoter. When a mutation was introduced into the SREa or SREc site, a substantial decrease in the fold activation by sterol depletion was observed (Fig. 4B). Mutation of either the SREb or SREd site caused a slight decrease but retained a high induction level (more than 4-fold). Together, these data demonstrate that sterol-mediated induction of the SI promoter is attributable to the NF-Y (CAT2) and Sp1 sites as well as the SREa and SREc sites. Next, gel mobility shift assays were performed to demonstrate the direct binding of SREBP-2 to the SRE sites. Fig. 5A shows that the SRE probe corresponding to the SRE in the human LDL receptor promoter was shifted after the addition of the SREBP-2 protein (first lane). In competition assays, the shifted band completely disappeared upon the addition of an excess amount of the unlabeled SREc probe (seventh lane) but was only slightly diminished by the SREa and SREd probes. Mutated probes did not compete with the labeled probe, but wild type probes did (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the competition observed in Fig. 5A is attributable to the specific nucleotide sequence in the SREc site. These data indicate that SREBP-2 activates the SI promoter mainly through binding to the SREc but partly also through the SREa, which is consistent with the results of the luciferase assays (Fig. 4B). Regulation of SI Gene Expression in Several Different Cell Lines—When HEK293 cells were transfected with various reporter genes including the SI gene promoter, we found that the luciferase activity was only slightly increased in response to sterol depletion in contrast to a marked rise (more than 8-fold in Fig. 4A) in HepG2 cells. Indeed, the mRNA levels of the SI gene in HEK293 cells were not significantly induced by sterol depletion (1.2-fold) as compared with a 4-fold induction in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 6). The increase in the HMG CoA synthase mRNA levels in HEK293 cells under the sterol-depleted conditions was also smaller than those in other cells but was still substantial (4.8-fold). The same tendency was observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). HNF-4 Stimulates SREBP-responsive Promoter Activity— The above observation allowed us to hypothesize that certain factor(s) such as HNF-4 or HNF-1 in these cells might ameliorate the low level of SREBP activity. Therefore we next determined whether the SI promoter reporter gene, pSI2000, responded to sterol depletion in HEK293 cells when transfected with an expression plasmid for HNF-4. Fig. 7A shows that the fold activation of the SI promoter activity in response to sterol depletion increased by expression of HNF-4 in a dose-dependent manner. It is possible that this HNF-4-mediated induction might be attributed to a direct transcriptional regulation of the SI gene through an as yet unknown HNF-4-responsive element in the SI promoter. However, overexpression of HNF-4 was not able to induce the SI promoter directly when the nuclear SREBPs levels were low under the sterol-loaded conditions, whereas both HNF-4 and SRBP-2 synergistically stimulated the luciferase activities (Fig. 7B). Surprisingly, the same results were obtained with both the HMG CoA synthase and LDL receptor promoter reporter genes. These data indicate that HNF-4 can activate the promoter of the SREBP-responsive genes coordinately with SREBP-2. To determine the direct effect of HNF-4 on the transcriptional activity of SREBP-2, we employed a heterologous Gal4 system. In this assay luciferase gene transcription is driven by a promoter that contains five consensus Gal4-binding sites, without any co-regulatory transcription factors such as Sp1 and/or NF-Y. HEK293 cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid, pG5Luc, and an expression plasmid encoding SREBP-2 coupled to the DNA-binding domain of yeast Gal4. Although an expression plasmid encoding only the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, pGal4, did not promote luciferase activities, Gal4-SREBP2 significantly enhanced transcription of the reporter gene with an increasing expression of HNF-4 (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that HNF-4 accelerates transcription of SREBP target genes by stimulating the transcriptional activity of SREBP-2, not because of a strengthening of the DNA affinity of SREBP-2 or the interaction between SREBP-2 and the coregulatory transcription factors, Sp1 and NF-Y. Furthermore, the induced SI promoter activity in response to sterol depletion in HepG2 cells significantly decreased by reduction in endogenous HNF-4 gene expression using siRNAs against HNF-4 (Fig. 7D). In these experiments all of the cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of siRNA expression plasmids, pSiHNF4, and/or pSi (unrelated siRNAs). These data indicate the importance of HNF-4 in the regulation of SREBP-responsive gene expression. Protein-Protein Interaction between SREBP-2 and HNF-4 — We speculated that the direct stimulating effect of HNF-4 is due to its direct binding to SREBP-2. To confirm an interaction between HNF-4 and SREBP-2 proteins, we performed a GST pull-down assay. When GST-SREBP-2-bound agarose beads were incubated with the in vitro translated HNF-4, a 35S-labeled band corresponding to HNF-4 was detected (Fig. 8A, first and second lanes). There was no detectable interaction with the GST control resin (second lane). This indicates that SREBP-2 and HNF-4 interact in solution in the absence of DNA. Fig. 8B shows that HNF-4 is co-precipitable with SREBP-2 when both FLAG-HNF4 and GST-SREBP2 are overexpressed in HEK293 cells. We observed the upper band in the second lane (marked by an asterisk in Fig. 8B) that was not detected in the nuclear extracts (first lane). It is likely that the band was nonspecific, but it is possible that acetylated or phosphorylated HNF-4 (26Soutouglou E. Katrakili N. Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 27Jiang G. Nepomuceno L. Yang Q. Sladek F.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) might preferentially interact with SREBP-2. To see the direct interaction between endogenous SREBP-2 and HNF-4, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the nuclear extracts from HepG2 and HEK293 cells cultured under the sterol-depleted conditions. Endogenous SREBP-2 in HepG2 cells was co-immunoprecipitable with HNF-4, whereas SREBP-2 in HEK293 cells was not precipitated in the absence of HNF-4 (Fig. 8C). These results clearly show the direct interaction between HNF-4 and SREBP-2 proteins. The current study is the first report showing evidence that SI is one of the SREBP-responsive genes and that the SI promoter contains essential functional elements required for SREBP-2, Sp1, and NF-Y activity. The present finding that expression of the SI gene is regulated by SREBPs is not really surprising, because this gene encodes an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. But surprising or not, it does provide us with a vital clue to a novel interaction between SREBP-2 and a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, HNF-4, which is most highly expressed at the highest levels in the liver, intestine, pancreas, and kidney in mammals. In the current experiments we noticed that both the SI gene expression and the SI promoter only weakly responded to sterol depletion in HEK293 cells in contrast to their high response in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells. This led us to hypothesize that certain factor(s) lacking in HEK293 cells might potentiate the SREBP functions in the enterohepatic cells. We examined the stimulating effects of some plausible candidates including HNF-4 and HNF-1, which are highly expressed in the liver and intestine and are tightly involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism in these tissues (28Shih D.Q. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Shefer S. Bollileni J.S. Gonzalez F.J. Breslow J.L. Stoffel M. Nat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and found that HNF-4, but not HNF-1 (data not shown), augments the transcriptional activity of SREBP-2 via a direct interaction, thereby promoting the induction of SREBP-responsive gene expression in enterohepatic cells. Indeed, the HNF-4 expression levels in HEK293 cells were much less than those in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells (data not shown). Moreover, it is reported that the nuclear thyroid hormone receptor interacts with SREBP-1-enhancing acetyl CoA carboxylase transcription in hepatocytes (31Yin L. Zhang Y. Hillgartner F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19554-19565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We also confirmed the stimulating effect of HNF-4 on SREBP-1a activity by reporter assays (data not shown). Based on the fact that the structure of the nuclear receptors is highly conserved among the family members, some members of this family other than just thyroid hormone receptor and HNF-4 might interact with the SREBPs and affect their activities. The mechanism by which HNF-4 augments the transcriptional activity of SREBPs remains unclear. One possibility is that NHF-4 masks a negatively regulatory domain localizing in the COOH-terminal region of nuclear SREBPs, the truncation of which somehow enhances the transcriptional activities of the SREBPs (32Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We indeed found that the COOH-terminal domain containing ∼90 amino acids of the nuclear SREBPs does exert a transcriptional repression function when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain plus the SREBP-1a activation domain including the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids (data not shown). HNF-4 might compete with an as yet unidentified factor recruited to the negative regulatory domain, which limits SREBPs functions. In contrast, it has been reported that the SREBPs recruit the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein/p300 as a co-activator for regulating transcription of their target genes (33Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen K.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Ericksson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1 interacts and works with HNF-4 to activate the expression of genes in lipid and glucose homeostasis (35Louet J.-F. Hayhurst G. Gonzalez F.J. Girard J. Decaux J.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37991-38000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Vidal-Puig A. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 2001; 413: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1 physically interacts with CREB-binding protein in vitro (37Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that a protein complex containing the SREBPs, HNF-4, CREB-binding protein, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ co-activator-1 could effectively form and activate the expression of SREBP-responsive genes in hepatic cells. Now it is under investigation which regions in the SREBPs and HNF-4 molecules are required for mutual interaction and whether a tetrameric protein complex can be formed. Furthermore, it will be of interest to examine whether the SREBPs affect the expression of HNF-4-responsive genes. Data from the present study indicate that the SREBPs must interact with HNF-4 to be effective in regulating the transcription of cholesterogenic enzymes including SI in enterohepatic tissues. This means that upon sterol deprivation the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver and intestine is accelerated by the SREBPs and HNF-4 activity. The synergistic activity of the SREBPs and HNF-4 in these organs apparently takes place to distribute lipids to other tissues, which do not have the capacity to biosynthesize sufficient lipids on their own. A recent study that carried out liver-specific disruption of the HNF-4α gene revealed that HNF-4 is essential for the constitutive expression of several key hepatic genes involved in lipid homeostasis (29Stroup D. Chiang J.Y.L. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fabiani E.D. Mitro N. Anzulovich A.C. Pinelli A. Galli G. Crestani M J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). This ostensible role for HNF-4 is in close agreement with our current findings. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the complex network between the SREBPs and the nuclear receptors, not only of HNF-4 but also the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, the farnesoid X receptor, and the liver X receptor, all of which play critical roles in lipid homeostasis.

Chk2 is also autophosphorylated following DNA damage. It is proposed that autophosphorylation of Chk2 may contribute to Chk2 activation. To fully understand the regulation of Chk2, we mapped an in vitro Chk2 autophosphorylation site at C-terminal serine 516 site (Ser-516). Ser-516 of Chk2 is phosphorylated following radiation in vivo, and this phosphorylation depends on the kinase activity of Chk2. Mutation of this autophosphorylation site (S516A) results in reduced Chk2 kinase activity, suggesting that Chk2 autophosphorylation is required for full kinase activation following DNA damage. Moreover, the S516A mutant of Chk2 is defective in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Chk2 autophosphorylation is critical for Chk2 function following DNA damage.

The maintenance of genome stability relies on the efficient detection of DNA lesions, the rapid transmission of DNA damage signals, and DNA repair. DNA damage signals lead to either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage allows time for DNA repair. On the other hand, if cells fail to repair, they undergo apoptosis. If cells cannot properly respond to DNA damage signals, damaged DNA will be passed onto the daughter cells and the accumulation of mutations will lead to tumorigenesis (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J.

Thus, the integrity of DNA damage-signaling pathways is critical for tumor prevention.

Jackson S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Following DNA damage, ATM is activated and phosphorylates a number of downstream effectors to enforce checkpoint controls (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar, 5Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). One critical substrate is checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), a downstream regulator of ATM (6Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). After DNA damage, Chk2 is directly phosphorylated and activated by ATM (5Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 6Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Chk2 may participate in multiple ATM-dependent pathways. For example, Chk2 can phosphorylate p53 at Ser-20 in vitro, and this phosphorylation may be required for the stabilization of p53 and G1 arrest following DNA damage (9Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Appel M. Halazonetis T.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 278-288PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 289-300PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S.

However, it is also reported that Chk2 is dispensable for p53-mediated G1 arrest (12Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition, Chk2 could regulate the S phase checkpoint by phosphorylating Cdc25A (13Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 14Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat.

However, more recent studies using Chk2 knockout mice showed normal S phase and G2/M transition in Chk2-deficient cells (11Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 16Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M.

Thus, it remains to be resolved whether Chk2 is involved in certain aspects of the ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint controls. The role of Chk2 in the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis has been established recently by several groups (12Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nat Cell Biol. 2002; 28: 28Google Scholar). It appears that Chk2 can regulate IR-induced apoptosis through p53-dependent (12Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or p53-independent (18Peters M. DeLuca C. Hirao A. Stambolic V. Potter J. Zhou L. Liepa J. Snow B. Arya S. Wong J.

Nat Cell Biol. 2002; 28: 28Google Scholar) pathways. The exact mechanism of the Chk2-dependent apoptosis pathway has not yet been fully understood. Because Chk2 is a DNA damage-activated protein kinase, the function of Chk2 depends on its ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates after DNA damage (21McGowan C.H. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Dasika G.K. Lin S.C. Zhao S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7883-7899Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The regulation of Chk2 activation following IR has been well studied. In response to IR, Chk2 is phosphorylated at Thr-68 by ATM (5Melchionna R. Chen X.B. Blasina A. McGowan C.H. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Chaturvedi P. Eng W.K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K. Winkler J.D. Zhou B.B.

A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The initial phosphorylation of Chk2 at the Thr-68 site can lead to autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-383 and Thr-387, two sites within the activation loop of Chk2 kinase domain (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mutation of these two residues (Thr to Ala) abolishes Chk2 activation (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating that autophosphorylation of Chk2 may directly affect Chk2 kinase activity. In addition, the phosphorylated Thr-68 site of Chk2 also interacts with the FHA domain of another Chk2 molecule, and thus leads to the formation of Chk2 oligomers (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Chk2 oligomerization may further regulate Chk2 activation, because Chk2 can also autophosphorylate its FHA domain in vitro and these phosphorylation events at the FHA domain lead to dissociation of Chk2 oligomers in vitro (24Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19389-19395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of these proposed regulations of Chk2 remains to be tested in vivo. To fully understand the complexity of Chk2 regulation, we have mapped an additional Chk2 autophosphorylation site (Ser-516). We have shown that Ser-516 phosphorylation is required for the optimal activation of Chk2 and IR-induced apoptosis in vivo, providing a link between the regulation of Chk2 kinase activity and the function of Chk2 following DNA damage. Constructs—Mammalian expression plasmid encoding HA-tagged Chk2 was described earlier (26Wu X. Webster S.R. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2971-2974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) was used to introduce point mutations in the Chk2 coding sequence for the generation of expression constructs encoding Chk2 kinase inactive, S516A, T383A, and T68A mutants. Wild-type or various mutant Chk2 fragments containing Chk2 residues 477–543 were subcloned into the pGEX 5x-3 vector for the expression of these fragments as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. These Chk2 fragments were used to map the Chk2 autophosphorylation site at the C terminus. GST-Cdc25C, containing the C-terminal fragment (residues 200–256) of Cdc25C, was used as a Chk2 substrate (27Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—All cell lines were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection and cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish stable cell lines expressing HA-tagged wild-type or mutant Chk2, HCT15 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated HA-tagged wild-type or mutant Chk2. G418-resistant clones were isolated, and exogenous Chk2 expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-Chk2 antibody. Clones that have similar expression levels of Chk2 were used in this study. The stable cell lines are cultivated in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 200 μg/ml G418. Sf9 insect cells were cultivated in Grace's insect media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 28 °C. Antibodies—The generation of anti-Chk2 (number 7) monoclonal antibody and anti-Chk2pT68 antibody were reported earlier (27Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To generate phospho-specific antibodies against Chk2 Ser-516 site, Ser(P)-516 (pS516) peptide (CVLAQP(p)STSRKR) was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and used as antigen to immunize rabbits. Anti-Ser(P)-516 antibody was affinity-purified as described previously (27Ward I.M. Wu X. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47755-47758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Anti-Chk2 pT383pT387 antibody is a gift from Dr. Jay H. Chung. In Vitro Chk2 Kinase Assay—Active GST-Chk2 isolated from SF9 cells was used as kinase and incubated with substrates for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, with 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 2× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. 32P incorporation in substrates was visualized by autoradiography. Mapping Chk2 Autophosphorylation Site—HA-tagged Chk2 was immunoprecipitated from extracts of HCT15 cells stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type Chk2 or S516A mutant. In vitro autophosphorylation reactions were performed to label Chk2 with 32P radioisotope. Proteins were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and gel slices corresponding to Chk2 were excised. In-gel digestion with trypsin, peptide extraction, and HPLC separation were performed by the Mayo Clinic protein core facility. Phospho-peptide spotted on the paper was visualized by autoradiography and corresponding peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation. Dephosphorylation of Chk2—293T cells were radiated. Cells were harvested 1 h after IR.Chk2 was precipitated with anti-Chk2A antibody. Precipitated Chk2 was treated with Lambda phophatase (BioLab), mixture of Lambda phosphatase inhibitor (1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 mm β-glycerophophate, and 20 nm microcystin) and Lambda phosphatase, respectively. Western blots were done with anti-Chk2 and anti-pS516. Radiation-induced Apoptosis—To assay radiation-induced apoptosis, HCT116, HCT116 with Chk2-/- (28Jallepalli P.V. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Bunz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20475-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), HCT15, and HCT15 cell line expressing wild-type or S516A mutant of Chk2 were plated in 6-cm culture plates. 28 or 36 h after 10 or 30 Gy of radiation, cells were trypsinized, washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin, and fixed in methanol/acetic acid solution (3:1) for 1 h. Fixed cells were dropped onto the glass slides, and the slides were dried. Cells were stained with Hoechst solution, and the numbers of cells with fragmented nuclei were counted under the microscope. For TUNEL assay, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline on ice for 15 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer (10 μl of 5× buffer, 0.04 μm of BrdUrdUTP, 0.5 μl of TdT). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 40 min. After that, cells were washed with rinsing buffer and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd mAb for 30 min at 22 °C. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells are counted as apoptotic cells. Chk2 Oligomerization Assay—GST-Chk2 FHA fragment (containing residues 61–226) generated in E. coli cells were used to pull down Chk2 from whole cell extract as indicated. Proteins bound to GST-Chk2 FHA domain were eluted and separated on SDS-PAGE. Western blot was performed using anti-HA or anti-Chk2 antibodies to determine the oligomerization of Chk2. Autophosphorylation Site at the Chk2 C Terminus—Autophosphorylation of Chk2 increases following DNA damage (see Ref. 6Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

To determine Chk2 autophosphorylation sites, we generated stable cell lines expressing HA-tagged Chk2 in Chk2-deficient HCT15 cells. Chk2 was immunoprecipitated from control and IR-treated HCT15 cells expressing wild-type or kinase-dead Chk2. As shown in Fig. 1A, the kinase activity of Chk2 increased following DNA damage. The phosphorylation of Chk2 in vitro depends on the kinase activity of Chk2, suggesting that this phosphorylation is due to autophosphorylation of Chk2, rather than a contaminating kinase(s). To determine the autophosphorylation sites of Chk2, the 32P-labeled Chk2 bands were excised, and in-gel trypsinization, extraction, and HPLC separation were performed. The HPLC fractions were spotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and radiolabeled phospho-peptide was visualized by autoradiography. Only one major spot was found in samples derived from wild-type Chk2 (Fig. 1B). The radio-labeled peptide was sequenced by Edman degradation (Fig. 1B), and was found to correspond to the C terminus of Chk2 (495KFQDLLSEE NESTALPQVLAQPSTSR519) Chk2 Is Autophosphorylated in Vitro at Ser-516 —Due to the limited amount of Chk2 we were able to purify from the cell, we could not determine the phosphorylation sites within this peptide by phosphopeptide sequencing. There are 6 potential phosphorylation sites (serine or threonine) within the peptide we sequenced. To further map the autophosphorylation site(s) within this peptide, we generated GST fusion proteins containing the residues 477–543 of Chk2 as wild-type or mutant (Ser/Thr mutated to Ala) proteins (Fig. 1C). Only mutant 3 was not phosphorylated by Chk2 in vitro (Fig. 1D), suggesting that one or more of the sites mutated in mutant 3 is the autophosphorylation site. Further studies using single mutants of each potential phosphorylation site within mutant 3 demonstrated that Ser-516 is the only autophosphorylation site within this peptide (Fig. 1E). Ser-516 of Chk2 Is Phosphorylated in Vivo Following DNA Damage—To investigate whether Ser-516 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo, we generated a Ser-516 phospho-specific antibody. The phospho-specific antibody (pS516) recognized wildtype Chk2 only after DNA damage (Fig. 2A), and phosphatase-treatment abolished the ability of this antibody to recognize Chk2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, this phospho-specific antibody failed to recognize the Ser-516 to Ala mutant of Chk2 after IR (Fig. 3B), confirming the specificity of this pS516 phosphspecific antibody. Taken together, these data indicate that Chk2 is phosphorylated at Ser-516 in intact cells following DNA damage.Fig. 3Phosphorylation of Ser-516 site occurs late in the activation of Chk2 following DNA damage. A, the expression levels of wild-type or mutant Chk2 in HCT15 stable cell lines are similar to that of endogenous Chk2 in A549 cells. B, Thr-68 phosphorylation of Chk2 is required for phosphorylation of Chk2 at the Ser-516 site. HCT15 cells stably expressing wild-type (WT), Thr-68 to Ala (T68A), or Ser-516 to Ala (S516A) mutants of Chk2 were mock-treated or treated with 10 Gy of IR. Western blots were performed using anti-Chk2, anti-pT68, or pS516 phospho-specific antibodies. C, Chk2 Thr-383/387 sites are phosphorylated before the phosphorylation of Ser-516 site. Indicated cells are mocktreated or irradiated (10 Gy) and collected one hour later. Chk2 was immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-Chk2, anti-pT383pT387, or anti-S516P antibodies. D, Chk2 S516A mutant does not affect Chk2 oligomerization. Extracts from indicated cell lines were prepared before and after radiation. Oligomerization of Chk2 was examined by GST-Chk2 FHA domain pull-down. The left panel indicates the equal expression of wild-type or mutant Chk2 in these HCT15 derivative cell lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ser-516 Is an in Vivo Autophosphorylation Site—To confirm that Ser-516 is an autophosphorylation site in vivo, we used Chk2-deficient HCT15 cells stably expressing wild-type or kinase-inactive Chk2. As shown in Fig. 2B, Ser-516 site was only phosphorylated in cells expressing wild-type Chk2 after DNA damage, but not in cells expressing a kinase-inactive form of Chk2, suggesting that indeed Ser-516 is an autophosphorylation site in vivo. Autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 Correlates with Thr-68 Phosphorylation of Chk2 Following DNA Damage—It is not clear whether autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 contribute to the regulation of Chk2 following DNA damage. We first examined whether there is any difference between Chk2 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68, an ATM-dependent phosphorylation site required for Chk2 activation. As shown in Fig. 2C, Ser-516 phosphorylation correlates with phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 following various doses of radiation. Time course studies indicates that the maximal autophosphorylation of Ser-516 occurs slightly later than Thr-68 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D), suggesting that Chk2 may be phosphorylated at Thr-68 before it can be autophosphorylated at Ser-516. Ser-516 Phosphorylation Occurs Late in the Activation of Chk2 Following DNA Damage—To examine the sequential regulation of various phosphorylation events on Chk2, we established HCT15 cell lines expressing various phosphorylation mutants of Chk2 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The expression levels of these exogenous Chk2 in HCT15 cells are similar to that of endogenous Chk2 in A549 cells or other cell lines (Fig. 3A and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3B, although we failed to detect Ser-516 phosphorylation in the Chk2T68A mutant, we readily detected Thr-68 phosphorylation in the Chk2 S516A mutant following DNA damage. Thus, it is likely that phosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 requires initial Thr-68 phosphorylation in vivo. Besides Thr-68, Thr-383 and Thr-387 have recently been identified as Chk2 autophosphorylation sites (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation events occur at the Chk2 activation loop and are required for the activation of Chk2 (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, we observed that the Thr-383/T387 sites were phosphorylated following DNA damage in S516A mutant, suggesting that Ser-516 phosphorylation is not required for Chk2 phosphorylation at the activation loop. In agreement with that Ser-516 phosphorylation requires Chk2 kinase activity (Fig. 2B), we failed to detect Ser-516 phosphorylation in Chk2T383A mutant (Fig. 3C), because this mutant abolished Chk2 kinase activity in vivo (data not shown). These data suggest that Thr-383/387 phosphorylation occurs before Ser-516 phosphorylation following DNA damage. Chk2 oligomerizaton has recently been proposed to be important for Chk2 activation following DNA damage. The oligomerization of Chk2 is mediated through the interaction between Chk2 FHA domain and the Thr-68 phosphorylation site of Chk2. Both S516A and T383A mutants can still be phosphorylated by ATM at the Thr-68 site (Fig. 3B and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3D, both mutants still retain the ability to form oligomers following DNA damage. Taken together, these data suggest the following steps in Chk2 activation following DNA damage. First, Chk2 is phosphorylated by ATM at the Thr-68 site. This initial phosphorylation event leads to the oligomerization of Chk2 and the phosphorylation of Chk2 at the activation loop (Thr-383/387). Thr-383/387 phosphorylation increases Chk2 kinase activity and further phosphorylates Chk2 at Ser-516 site. Autophosphorylation at Ser-516 Is Required for Optimal Activation of Chk2 Following IR—To investigate the role of Ser-516 autophosphorylation in Chk2 activation, we used HCT15 cells expressing wild-type or the Ser-516 Ala mutant (S516A) of Chk2. Ectopically expressed wild-type and mutant Chk2 were immunoprecipitated before and after DNA damage. In vitro Chk2 kinase assays were performed to compare the activity of S516A mutant with that of wild-type Chk2. As shown in Fig. 4, the kinase activity of S516A mutant, as determined by its ability to phosphorylate Cdc25C, was decreased compared with that of wild-type Chk2. Densitometry analysis indicated that the kinase activity of Chk2 S516A mutant was decreased by about 50%. Interestingly, the basal activity of Chk2 S516A mutant was also reduced (Fig. 4). There was also reduced, but not absent, Chk2 autophosphorylation in the S516A mutant, suggesting the existence of additional Chk2 autophosphorylation sites (for example Thr-383/387 sites) as suggested by early studies (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation at Ser-516 Is Required for IR-induced Apoptosis—Recent studies suggest that Chk2 regulates ionizing radiation (IR)-induced apoptosis (12Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9825-9829Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Xu J. Xin S. Du W.

Indeed, we found increased apoptosis in HCT116 cells that contain wildtype Chk2, but not in HCT116 Chk2-/- cells (Fig. 5A) (28Jallepalli P.V. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Bunz F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20475-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This suggests that Chk2 is involved in IR-induced apoptosis in human cells. To test whether Ser-516 phosphorylation is required for Chk2 function in IR-induced apoptosis, we again used HCT15 cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant Chk2. As shown in Fig. 5B, increased apoptosis following IR was observed in cells expressing wild-type Chk2 but not in parental HCT15 cells, confirming that Chk2 is required for IR-induced apoptosis. Mutation of S516A in Chk2 greatly reduced apoptosis following IR (Fig. 5, B and C). TUNEL assays using three independent S516A mutant cell lines were performed to verify that the S516A mutant is defective in IR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data suggest that autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 is critical for its function following IR. In this study, we have identified Ser-516 as a new Chk2 autophosphorylation site. Ser-516 is phosphorylated in vivo after the initial activation of Chk2 by Thr-68 and Thr-383/387 phosphorylation. Mutation of Chk2 at Ser-516 reduces Chk2 kinase activity and abolishes the IR-induced apoptosis, suggesting that autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 is required for full activation of Chk2 and Chk2 function following DNA damage. Using in-gel digestion and HPLC purification, we have only mapped one of the autophosphorylation sites (Ser-516) on Chk2. There are apparently additional Chk2 autophosphorylation sites (see Fig. 4). Two of them (Thr-383 and Thr-387), reside at the activation loop of Chk2 kinase domain, have been reported earlier (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mutations of Thr-383 and Thr-387 to Ala abolished Chk2 activity (23Lee C.H. Chung J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30537-30541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), suggesting that these two autophosphorylation sites are crucial for Chk2 activation. Thus, it appears that different autophosphorylation sites on Chk2 regulate distinct steps in Chk2 activation. Indeed, a complex picture of Chk2 activation following DNA damage is emerging. After DNA damage, phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr-68 by ATM leads to the initial oligomerization of Chk2, mediated by the interaction between the Chk2 Thr68 phosphorylation site and the Chk2 FHA domain (24Xu X. Tsvetkov L.M. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4419-4432Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 25Ahn J.Y. Li X. Davis H.L. Canman C.E. J. Biol.

It is possible, although not yet proven, that the oligomerization of Chk2 may lead to autophosphorylation and full activation of Chk2. Our results presented here agree with this complex model of Chk2 activation following DNA damage. Despite intensive studies in the last few years, the exact function of Chk2 in DNA damage responses is not fully understood. What is the function of Chk2? Recent studies suggest that Chk2 may regulate IR-induced apoptosis (12Jack M.T. Woo R.A. Hirao A. Cheung A. Mak T.W. Lee P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nat Cell Biol. 2002; 28: 28Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed IR-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells containing wild-type Chk2, but not in HCT116-derived Chk2-/- cells. We also detected a 3-fold increase in apoptosis in wildtype mouse embryonic fibroblast but not in Chk2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells following radiation (data not shown). In addition, Chk2 is required for IR-induced apoptosis in HCT15-Chk2 wild-type cells but not in HCT15-Chk2 T68A cells, which do not have Chk2 kinase activity (30Lou Z. Minter-Dykhouse K. Wu X. Chen J. Nature. 2003; 421: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). All these studies suggest that Chk2 and Chk2 kinase activity are required for IR-induced apoptosis. Using HCT15 cells, we have shown that indeed autophosphorylation of Chk2 at Ser-516 is required for IR-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5, B and C). The IR-induced apoptosis observed in this study is mediated through a p53-independent pathway, because only mutant p53 exists in HCT15 cells (31Bell D.W. Varley J.M. Szydlo T.E. Kang D.H. Wahrer D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2025064492,"Circulating natriuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) counterbalance the effects of hypertension and inhibit cardiac hypertrophy by activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). Natriuretic peptide binding to type I receptors (NPRA and NPRB) activates their intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity, resulting in a rapid increase in cytosolic cGMP that subsequently activates PKG. Phosphorylation of the receptor by an unknown serine/threonine kinase is required before ligand binding can activate the cyclase. While searching for downstream PKG partners using a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library, we unexpectedly found an upstream association with NPRA. PKG is a serine/threonine kinase capable of phosphorylating NPRA in vitro; however, regulation of NPRA by PKG has not been previously reported. Here we show that PKG is recruited to the plasma membrane following ANP treatment, an effect that can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PKG activation. Furthermore, PKG participates in a ligand-dependent gain-of-function loop that significantly increases the intrinsic cyclase activity of the receptor. PKG translocation is ANP-dependent but not nitric oxide-dependent. Our results suggest that anchoring of PKG to NPRA is a key event after ligand binding that determines distal effects. As such, the NPRA-PKG association may represent a novel mechanism for compartmentation of cGMP-mediated signaling and regulation of receptor sensitivity.

Natriuretic peptide binding to type I receptors (NPRA and NPRB) on target cells activates their intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity, resulting in a rapid increase in cGMP. Diffusible cGMP acts as a second messenger primarily by stimulating PKG (19Silberbach M. Roberts Jr., C.T. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). PKG is the major mediator of cGMP-induced smooth muscle relaxation (20Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F.

Furthermore, there is recent evidence that the membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase, NPRA, but not soluble cyclases that are activated by nitric oxide, has potent effects on plasma membrane control of the calcium ATPase pump (25Zolle O.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25892-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO- and NP-mediated effects are compartmentalized in cells. Although the NPRA cDNA was first cloned more than 13 years ago (26Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), its regulation remains poorly understood. In its prebound state, the NPRA receptor exists as a homodimer (27Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but ligand binding alone is insufficient to induce cyclase activity. Rather, phosphorylation of six serine and threonine residues in the intracellular juxtamembrane-kinase homology domain makes the receptor susceptible to NP activation (28Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The protein kinase that mediates receptor phosphorylation is unknown. We have previously reported that ANP inhibits cardiac hypertrophy through cGMP/PKG-mediated activation of the ERK signaling cascade at the level of MEK (9Silberbach M. Gorenc T. Hershberger R.E.

PKG substrates are membrane-bound (29Jiang L.H. Gawler D.J. Hodson N. Milligan C.J. Pearson H.A. Porter V. Wray D. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 91: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and intranuclear (31Gudi T. Lohmann S.M. Pilz R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5244-5254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify novel proteins that could be candidates for linking PKG to MEK, we used a cytosolic yeast two-hybrid system employing PKG as bait. We found that PKG directly interacts with NPRA. These results were initially quite surprising, because PKG was previously thought to regulate only downstream ANP targets. However, it has been demonstrated previously that PKG is a serine/threonine kinase capable of phosphorylating NPRA in vitro (32Larose L. Rondeau J.J. Ong H. De Lean A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 115: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We report for the first time the regulation of NPRA by PKG. Yeast Two-hybrid Studies—Screening for PKG-interacting proteins was done using a commercially available system (CytoTrap, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that identifies protein-protein interactions in the yeast cytoplasm. Rather than relying on transcriptional activation to detect interactions, the RAS signal transduction cascade is initiated by recruitment of hSOS to the plasma membrane in a temperature-sensitive mutant yeast strain, cdc25H, by virtue of the interaction of its bait fusion partner with a myristoylated prey protein, which allows growth at 36 °C. A bovine PKG Iα cDNA was cloned in-frame into the hSOS bait plasmid. A human heart cDNA library in the pMyr plasmid (Stratagene) containing 7.4 × 106 independent clones was cotransfected with the pPKG-hSOS expression vector into competent cdc25H cells, which were then grown for 4 days at 25 °C on minimal glucose plates. Colonies were isolated and tested for galactose-dependent growth at 36 °C. Plasmids were extracted from three initially positive colonies, and the inserts were sequenced before retransformation in cdc25H cells together with pPKG-hSOS. Conventional yeast transformation and manipulation protocols were used. Cells were replica-plated onto either glucoseor galactose-minimal medium containing relevant amino acids, according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunocytochemistry—HEK-NPRA and HEK293 control cells were incubated in 4-well chamber slides at a density of ∼100,000 cells/cm2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin solution (Invitrogen). After fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min and blocked with 1% horse serum, 0.2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed slides were incubated with a primary antibody mixture containing 0.1 μg/ml rabbit anti-PKG I (Stressgen) or rabbit anti-PKA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 0.7 μg/ml mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). The immunogen used to generate the anti-PKG I antisera has no homology to PKG II making cross-reactivity extremely unlikely. Cells were blocked for 1 h and then for an additional hour with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy5-conjugated donkey secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories); cells were then mounted on coverslips using Gel/Mount mounting medium (Biomedia Corp.). Cardiac cells were treated identically, except fixed cells were incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Fluorescent imaging was performed with a Leica DMRA upright fluorescent microscope, and images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA2 CCD camera. Cardiac Cell Culture—The care of all animals used in this research was in accordance with institutional guidelines. Ventricular cardiac cells from 1–2-day-old Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described previously (33Simpson P. Circ. Res. 1985; 56: 884-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Ventricles were dissected free from atria and quartered. Myocytes were dissociated in trypsin and DNase I and preplated to remove non-myocyte cells. In all experiments, cells were plated on gelatin-coated chamber slides (∼400,000 cells/chamber) and maintained overnight at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 17% Media 199, 10% horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated in 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% Media 199 (Invitrogen), and phenylephrine (1 μm) 72 h before treatments. Preparation of Plasma Membranes—Plasma membranes were made as described previously (26Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). HEK-NPRA and control cells were plated at equal densities and transfected with 1 μg of the PKG expression vector using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). After a 48-h incubation, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 0.5 ml of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Cells were then mechanically lysed by flushing repeatedly through a 22-gauge needle. The particulate fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed once with scraping buffer prior to experiments. In Vitro Kinase Activity—Kinase activity measurements were performed as described (34Patel A.I. Diamond J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 885-893PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membrane lysates were solubilized in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Following centrifugation (5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), 50 μl of FLAG-M2-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma A220) were added to the supernatant and rocked overnight at 4 °C. After additional washes in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 μl of kinase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgOAc, 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 150 μm BPDEtide (PKG-specific substrate, Calbiochem)), 10 μCi/reaction [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 3,000 Ci/mm, ICN), and 1 μm synthetic protein kinase A inhibitor (Calbiochem) were added to the reaction, with or without 5 μm cGMP, and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. 40 μl was then spotted onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper. After air-drying, papers were washed 5 times with 0.5% phosphoric acid and radioactivity was quantified using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. In other studies, in vitro kinase activity was measured identically except that the immunoprecipitation steps were omitted. Guanylyl Cyclase Activity—Measurement of hormone-dependent guanylyl cyclase activity was performed as described (28Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), except that cold cGMP was added to the reactions to assure PKG activation in control cells. Crude membranes prepared from cells plated at equal densities were solubilized in 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 250 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 5 units/assay creatine phosphokinase, 100 nm 8-bromo-cGMP, 1 mm GTP, 5.5 μCi/reaction [α-32P]GTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mm, ICN), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm NaPO4, 0.1 m NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 80 μm β-glycerol phosphate) and treated as described. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and terminated by adding 500 μl of 110 mm ZnOAc. To precipitate unincorporated [α-32P]GTP, 500 μl of 110 mm sodium carbonate was added to each reaction. Following centrifugation, the supernatant was added to a chromatography column (Bio-Rad 731–1550) containing 1.0 g of dry neural alumina resin (Sigma A9003) acidified with 5 ml of 1 n perchloric acid. The column was washed sequentially with 20 ml of 1 n perchloric acid and 20 ml of water. [32P]cGMP was eluted into scintillation vials with 10 ml of 200 mm ammonium formate and counted using a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. NPRA and PKG Associate in Yeast—To identify potential PKG partners, we screened a human heart cDNA library using a cytosolic yeast two-hybrid system (see “Experimental Procedures”). Employing PKG as bait, the single positive clone identified corresponded to an ∼300-bp cDNA fragment of NPRA encoding the entire C-terminal cyclase domain and part of the so-called hinge region (35Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6057-6060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). NPRA and PKG Associate in Mammalian Cells—Experiments were carried out in HEK293 cells stably transfected with an expression vector encoding FLAG epitope-tagged NPRA (27Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (HEK-NPRA). HEK-NPRA cells exhibit a hormone-stimulated generation of cGMP, whereas untransfected HEK293 cells express minimal endogenous NPRA (28Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 2M. Chinkers, personal communication. Using FLAG antibody, it was not possible to co-immunoprecipitate levels of PKG from HEK-NPRA membranes that were detectable by Western immunoblotting, presumably because detergent solubilization disrupted the NPRA-PKG association. Attempts to release NPRA from membrane lysates while maintaining PKG association using a variety of concentrations of both ionic and nonionic detergents were unsuccessful. However, these same immunoprecipitates clearly contained low levels of PKG based upon highly sensitive PKG activity assays (Fig. 2A). Because NPRA is a transmembrane protein and membrane localization of PKG had not been previously reported, we prepared detergent-free lysates from crude membranes of HEK-NPRA and control cells that had both been transiently transfected with the PKG expression vector. PKG protein (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and kinase activity (Fig. 3C) were detectable in the HEK-NPRA membranes but not the control membrane fraction. Treatment with ANP for 15 and 60 min, but not 5 min, demonstrated an apparent increase in membrane-associated PKG protein in the HEK-NPRA membranes only (Fig. 2B). PKG protein was present equally in cytosolic fractions of HEK-NPRA and control cells (Fig. 2B, middle panel), and NPRA protein was observed only in the HEK-NPRA membranes (Fig. 2B, lower panel). In additional experiments, ANP treatment for either 15 or 30 min resulted in a significant increase in PKG activity in crude membrane preparations of HEK-NPRA cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data suggest that PKG is prebound to unliganded receptor and that ANP binding to NPRA recruits additional PKG to the cell membrane.Fig. 3ANP treatment recruits endogenous and transfected PKG to the plasma membrane of HEK-NPRA cells. A, NPRA co-localizes with endogenous PKG. HEK-NPRA cells were treated with ANP (1 μm) for the indicated times. Cells were decorated with monoclonal flag antibody specific for FLAG-NPRA (red) and polyclonal PKG antibody (green). Yellow indicates regions of overlapping signal. No PKG staining was seen when anti-PKG antibody was pre-adsorbed with recombinant PKG protein (Calbiochem) (bottom panel). Images are from a single experiment and are representative of six independent experiments. In other control experiments, no immunofluorescence was seen in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown). B, cell membrane-associated ANP-dependent PKG activity. HEK-NPRA cells were transfected with a PKG expression vector and treated with ANP (1 μm) for the indicated times. Lysates prepared from detergent-free cell membranes were assayed for kinase activity in the presence of cGMP. Data are expressed as percent increase from reactions at the control time point (mean ± S.E. of two identical independent experiments, each performed in triplicate). C, PKG inhibition blocks ANP-induced endogenous PKG translocation. HEK-NPRA cells were treated with ANP (1 μm) with or without the PKG inhibitor KT5823 (1 μm, Acros/Fisher). Images are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next used immunofluorescence microscopy to verify the ANP-dependent co-localization of NPRA and endogenous PKG. After ANP treatment for 15, 30, and 60 min, we observed markedly increased staining of PKG at the membrane in HEK-NPRA cells (Fig. 3A) but not in control cells (data not shown). Furthermore, the PKG inhibitor KT5823 completely blocked the ANP-induced translocation of PKG to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C), suggesting that activation of PKG is necessary for ANP-induced translocation. In parallel control experiments, cytosolic PKA immunofluorescence was readily detectable, but PKA did not migrate to the plasma membrane after ANP treatment indicating that the effect is specific for PKG (data not shown). Thus, even after prolonged exposure to the ligand for up to 60 min PKG membrane staining persisted. To determine whether the presence of NP was required to maintain membrane localization of PKG, cells were treated for 30 min, washed, and incubated in NP-free medium for different lengths of time. Within 5 min of incubation in NP-free medium, membrane staining was lost (Fig. 4). Because we initially identified the NPRA-PKG interaction by screening a heart cDNA library and to determine whether ANP-induced translocation of PKG also occurred in non-transfected primary tissue-derived cells, we examined cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. In these primary cells, endogenous PKG migrated to the sarcolemma after ANP treatment (Fig. 5).Fig. 5ANP treatment recruits endogenous PKG to the sarcolemma of neonatal cardiac myocytes. Primary cells were grown in gelatin-coated slide wells and were either left untreated or stimulated with ANP (1 μm) for 1 h. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated polymerized actin fibers (red). PKG (green) is localized at the cell membrane after ANP treatment. No immunofluorescence was seen in the absence of primary antibody (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PKG Increases Receptor Cyclase Activity—To determine whether ANP-dependent recruitment of PKG to the plasma membrane regulates NPRA function, we measured the effect of PKG on ANP-induced guanylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 6). To eliminate the possibility that receptor function was down-regulated as a result of receptor internalization, increased cGMP phosphodiesterase activity, or phosphatase action, studies were performed using isolated membranes prepared from HEK-NPRA cells using an array of phosphatase inhibitors. Furthermore, to increase the specificity of the reaction, the PKA inhibitor PKI was added to the lysates. In these in vitro experiments, PKG treatment alone had no effect on guanylyl cyclase activity whereas ANP increased cyclase activity by ∼70%. The addition of recombinant PKG to the ANP treatments, however, increased cyclase activity by ∼150%. Thus, the addition of PKG increased the modest effect of ANP alone by 2-fold. To determine whether PKG translocation is a specific effect of ANP-induced NPRA activation or a general consequence of raising cGMP levels in the cell, we compared the effect of the nitric oxide donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNP) to ANP treatment. Using fluorescence immunohistochemistry, we observed robust PKG translocation after ANP treatment. However, SNP treatment had no effect on the translocation of endogenous cytosolic PKG (Fig. 7A). PKG translocation was not observed in control HEK cells with either SNP or ANP treatment (data not shown). To confirm that HEK-NPRA cells, in fact, contained activable soluble guanylyl cyclase, we measured cyclase activity in ANP- or SNP-treated cells. Soluble guanylyl cyclase activity was more than 2-fold higher in the SNP-treated cells compared with ANP-treated cells (Fig. 7B). We have demonstrated, both in yeast and in mammalian cells, a novel association of NPRA and PKG. Although the original finding in yeast was unexpected, the notion that PKG interacts with NPRA was compelling because PKG was already well established as a downstream component of the ANP-NPRA signal. The initial co-immunoprecipitation experiments did not demonstrate this interaction because the solubilization of membrane-bound NPRA with either ionic or non-ionic detergents presumably also reduced PKG binding. Nevertheless, highly sensitive PKG in vitro kinase activity assays of these same NPRA immunoprecipitates demonstrated that they contained PKG activity. Additionally, we have shown that PKG is found in membrane extracts from cells that had been stably transfected with an NPRA expression vector but not from non-expressing control cells. Finally, ANP-dependent co-localization of NPRA and PKG at the plasma membrane was subsequently corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy. We have also demonstrated ligand-dependent “feed-forward” regulation of NPRA by PKG. The requirement for an NPRA kinase was first suggested by Potter and Hunter (28Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in the NPRA kinase-like domain was essential for receptor function (18Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that prebound PKG is the NPRA kinase and that ANP binding is necessary and sufficient for both recruitment to and maintenance of membrane-bound PKG. Our findings may also be of relevance to brain natriuretic peptide because it is nearly identical in structure to ANP, and both ANP and brain natriuretic peptide preferentially bind with high affinity to NPRA (36Schulz S. Singh S. Bellet R.A. Singh G. Tubb D.J. Chin H. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1989; 58: 1155-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Finally, this ligand-dependent process appears to regulate the intrinsic guanylyl cyclase activity of NPRA. Thus, NPRA-PKG interaction may play a role in determining receptor sensitivity. We have demonstrated that ANP, but not the NO donor SNP, induces PKG translocation. These data suggest that PKG membrane recruitment is an effect of NPRA activation and not a general consequence of raising cGMP levels. Thus, soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclase appear to be compartmentalized with respect to PKG migration. How this observation relates to the regulation of diverse downstream PKG actions will require additional study. It is well established that both nitric oxide and NPs signal through cGMP generated by soluble and membrane-bound guanylyl cyclases, respectively. Most of the downstream actions of GMP (37Eigenthaler M. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Pilz R.B. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 173-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) occur through its binding and subsequent activation of PKG, but cGMP also directly regulates ion channels (38Mery P.F. Lohmann S.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 22477-22480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is recent evidence that particulate, but not soluble, cyclases have potent effects on plasma membrane control of calcium homeostasis (25Zolle O. Lawrie A.M. Simpson A.W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25892-25899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, whereas it is generally believed that such spatially and temporally distinct cGMP signals can coexist within cells, a precise mechanism for differentiating NP-versus NO-specified cellular events has never been proposed. Our data support the speculation that NP binding recruits PKG to a membrane pool that may segregate it from soluble guanylyl cyclase-generated cGMP and may simultaneously promote PKG activation via receptor cyclase-generated cGMP through NP binding. The existence of locally increased cGMP at the plasma membrane or elsewhere may explain early observations that despite extremely low cGMP concentrations in whole-cell lysates, cGMP-targeted ligands have potent and important biological effects. Manipulation of the NPRA-PKG interaction may favor enhanced ANP signaling in disease states. Although ANP is a potent vasodilator and diuretic in normal subjects, its beneficial effects are blunted in heart failure (15Cody R.J. Atlas S.A. Laragh J.H. Eur. Heart J. 1988; 9: 29-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), despite increased circulating ANP levels (43Burnett Jr., J.C. Kao P.C. Hu D.C. Heser D.W. Heublein D. Granger J.P. Opgenorth T.J. Reeder G.S. Science. 1986; 231: 1145-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Therefore, ANP-dependent receptor desensitization (16Ku D.D. Guo L. Dai J. Acuff C.G. Steinhelper M.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H2368-H2376PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tsutamoto T. Kanamori T. Morigami N. Sugimoto Y. Yamaoka O. Kinoshita M.

Physiol. 1999; 276: H1935-H1942PubMed Google Scholar) may limit the therapeutic utility of natriuretic peptide-based therapies. In fact, homologous desensitization of NPRA may be triggered specifically by a reduction in NPRA kinase activity (45Joubert S. Labrecque J. De Lean A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11096-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although our results indicate that the recruitment of PKG to the plasma membrane amplifies cyclase activity, further studies will be required to define the critical sequence or motif of the NPRA receptor responsible for PKG translocation and to determine whether exclusion of PKG from its NPRA-binding sites results in desensitization. We thank Michael Chinkers (University of Southern Alabama) for the HEK-NPRA cells, Thomas Lincoln (University of Alabama) for the PKG Iα expression vector, and Philip Stork, Richard Goodman, and Elizabeth Wilson (Oregon Health and Science University) for helpful discussions."

We found that penton capsomer (penton base linked to its fiber projection), full-length fiber protein, and its isolated knob domain were all capable of inducing DC maturation, whereas no significant DC maturation was observed for hexon or penton base alone. This capacity was severely reduced for AdGFPΔknob and for fiber protein deletion mutants lacking the β-stranded region F of the knob (residues Leu-485–Thr-486). The DC maturation effect was fully retained in a recombinant fiber protein deleted of the HI loop (FiΔHI), a fiber (Fi) deletion mutant that failed to trimerize, suggesting that the fiber knob-mediated DC activation did not depend on the integrity of the HI loop and on the trimeric status of the fiber.

The early inflammatory response is independent of the transgene expression (1Worgall S. Wolff G. Falck-Pedersen E. Crystal R.G. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), but the antigen-specific response can be directed to both viral and transgenic proteins (2Yang Y. Numes F.A. Berencsi K.

Med. 1996; 2: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). As a consequence, transgene expression is only transient, and the occurrence of anti-Ad neutralizing antibodies is in part responsible for the low efficiency of gene transfer using Ad vectors in preimmunized subjects (4Yang Y. Trinchieri G. Wilson J.M. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 5Gahéry-Ségard H. Molinier-Frenkel V. Le Boulaire C. Saulnier P. Opolon P. Lengagne R. Gautier E.

Several studies have attempted to elucidate the mechanism of Ad-triggered activation and the antigenic targets of the immune response against Ad vectors. Increasing evidence has emerged which shows that capsid components of the vector play a major role in this process. The Ad virion is composed of capsomers of two different types. Hexon (Hx) capsomers form the facets and edges of the icosahedral capsid, whereas penton (Pn) capsomers, located on the 5-fold axis of the virus, comprise a protruding fiber (Fi) protein (a homotrimer) linked via non-covalent bonds to the capsid-anchored penton base (Pb, a homopentamer). The fiber protein consists of three structural domains, the N-terminal tail, which binds to the penton base, the central shaft, and the C-terminal spherical domain, called the knob. The capsid proteins of the input virus are not only targets for the humoral and T helper responses (5Gahéry-Ségard H. Molinier-Frenkel V. Le Boulaire C. Saulnier P. Opolon P. Lengagne R. Gautier E.

The purpose of the present study was to identify the viral component(s) of the Ad5 capsid and structural domains thereof, which were responsible for the activation of bone marrow-derived murine DC. By using isolated Ad5 capsid proteins and virions deleted of the fiber terminal domain (knobless Ad5), we provide evidence that the fiber knob was the major viral factor of DC maturation. Experimental data obtained with deletion mutants of recombinant fiber protein mapped this function to region F, one of the 10 β-stranded regions defined by crystallographic analysis of the knob. Ad Virions and Capsid Proteins—AdE1° (kindly provided by Transgene SA, Strasbourg, France) was a replication-defective serotype 5 adenovirus (Ad5) deleted of both early regions E1 and E3 and carrying wild-type (WT) fibers (10Molinier-Frenkel V. Lengagne R. Gaden F. Hong S.S. Choppin J. Gahery-Segard H. Boulanger P. Guillet J.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). AdGFP (AdenoCMV5-GFP, obtained from Quantum Biotechnologies, Inc., Montreal, Canada) was an Ad5 vector carrying WT fibers and encoding the reporter gene for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Fiber deletion mutant AdGFPΔknob was derived from the AdGFP vector by insertion of an opale-stop codon in the fiber gene, downstream of an extrinsic trimerization signal introduced into the fiber shaft. This trimerization signal consisted of the neck region peptide from the human lung surfactant protein D, and the fiber construction has been described in detail elsewhere (22Magnusson M.K. Hong S.S. Boulanger P. Lindholm L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7280-7289Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Hong S.S. Magnusson M.K. Henning P. Lindholm L. Boulanger P. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 692-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting fiber lacked its entire knob domain (“knobless”) and contained only the tail domain and the N-terminal seven repeats of the shaft, i.e. residues 1–157. The schematic structure of the fibers of AdE1°, AdGFP, and AdGFPΔknob is depicted in Fig. 1, a and b. AdE1°, AdGFP, and AdGFPΔknob virions were isolated by isopycnic ultracentrifugation in continuous CsCl gradient (10Molinier-Frenkel V. Lengagne R. Gaden F. Hong S.S. Choppin J. Gahery-Segard H.

Capsid proteins hexon (abbreviated Hx) and penton capsomers (abbreviated Pn, for penton base + fiber) were isolated from WT Ad5-infected HeLa cells. Recombinant WT Ad5 proteins penton base (Pb), fiber (Fi), and fiber knob domain were isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Four Ad5 fiber mutants carrying deletions of various lengths in the knob domain (24Santis G. Legrand V. Hong S.S. Davison E. Kirby I. Imler J.L. Finberg R.W. Bergelson J.M. Mehtali M. Boulanger P. J.

Ad proteins were purified according to a protocol described in earlier studies (10Molinier-Frenkel V. Lengagne R. Gaden F. Hong S.S. Choppin J. Gahery-Segard H. Boulanger P. Guillet J.G. J.

Briefly, we used a three-step procedure consisting of (i) ammonium sulfate precipitation, (ii) anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography, and (iii) concentration-ultrafiltration through concentrator membranes with a 100-kDa cut-off. Protein samples were analyzed by conventional sodium dodecyl sulfate 12%-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10Molinier-Frenkel V. Lengagne R. Gaden F. Hong S.S. Choppin J. Gahery-Segard H.

The possible occurrence of endotoxins in Ad virion and protein preparations was assayed using amoebocyte lysate from Limulus polyphemus (E-TOXATE™, Sigma), with Escherichia coli serotype 055:B5 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as standard. Endotoxin concentration in the different batches of proteins never exceeded 30 pg/ml at the doses used for DC stimulation. At this concentration, Hx protein samples never induced DC maturation above the background of non-stimulated (NS) DC (see Fig. 2). CsCl-purified Ad virion preparations were totally free of detectable endotoxin contamination. Isolation of Dendritic Cells—This method was adapted from Ref. 27Mayordomo J.I. Zorina T. Storkus W.J.

Lymphocyte-depleted bone marrows from C57BL/6 (H2b) mice (Harlan, Gannat, France) were cultured overnight in complete medium (RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Non-adherent cells were harvested and resuspended in complete medium with 1000 units/ml recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and 100 units/ml rIL4 (R&D Systems). The medium was replaced at day 4. At day 6, aliquots of non-adherent cells were resuspended at 3 × 106/ml in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (i) without (non-stimulated DC (NS-DC)), (ii) with Ad5 capsid components, or (iii) with corresponding chromatographic fractions from extracts of Sf9 cells infected with baculoviral empty vector (mock-stimulated DC (MS-DC)), as indicated in the figure legends (expressed as doses/106 cells). After 1-h incubation, the cell concentration was adjusted to 3 × 105/ml with complete medium supplemented with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Control cells received 1 μg/ml LPS from E. coli (Sigma). At day 8, cells were harvested and analyzed in flow cytometry, mixed lymphocytic reaction, and immunization. Day 8 supernatants were collected. For the experiments described in Fig. 4a, DC were purified by using magnetic beads conjugated to anti-mouse CD11c mAb (Miltenyi Biotec). Flow Cytometry—DC were washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal calf serum. After incubation with anti-FcII/IIIR Ab (2.4G2, Pharmingen), cells were incubated with various combinations of the following mAbs (all from Pharmingen): phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-I-Ab (AF6-120.1) and anti-CD40 (3/23), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD11c (HL3) and anti-CD80 (16-10A1), biotinylated anti-H2-Db (28-8-6) and anti-CD86 (GL1) + streptavidin-PerCP (BD Biosciences). Anti-fiber-tail mouse mAb (4D2.5 (28Hong S.S. Karayan L. Tournier J. Curiel D.T. Boulanger P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2294-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar)) was obtained from Jeff Engler (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL). For Coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) staining, day 6 DC, Chinese hamster ovary and HeLa cells (obtained from ATCC) were labeled with anti-CAR mAb E1.1 (ascites fluid, kindly provided by Dr. Silvio Hemmi, University of Zurich) or a control irrelevant ascites fluid. Counterstaining was performed using biotinylated rat anti-mouse IgG and streptavidin-phosphatidylethanolamine. Flow cytometric analyses were performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). In Vitro Functional Assays (MLR, IL12, and TNFα)—For mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), day 8 DC were distributed at increasing doses and co-cultured for 4 days with aliquots of allogeneic (BALB/c, H2d) CD4+ purified splenocytes (2 × 105 cells/well). CD4+ T cell proliferation was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (1 μCi/well) during the final 18 h of coculture. For IL12 and TNFα assays, day 8 DC supernatants were tested using mouse IL12p70 and TNFα enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Pharmingen). Peptides—Immunodominant viral peptides, peptide 33–41 from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (KAVYNFATM) and peptide 366–374 from influenza virus nucleoprotein (ASNENMETM), abbreviated GP33 and NP366, respectively, were purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Both are H2-Db-restricted. Immunizations and CFSE-labeled Splenocyte Rejection Assays— C57BL/6 mice were immunized subcutaneously into the flank with 3 × 104, 8 × 104, or 2.5 × 105 DC loaded with GP33 or NP366 (10–6m). Ten days later, mice received an intravenous injection of 3 × 107 syngeneic splenocytes labeled with the fluorescent dye 5-6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Molecular Probes) as described in Ref. 29Oehen S. Brduscha-Riem K. Oxenius A. Odermatt B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 207: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. The percentage of CFSE+ donor cells among recipient peripheral blood lymphocytes or splenocytes was determined using FACS analysis. Donor cell rejection was calculated using the formula: (% of CFSE+ cells in immunized mice) (% of CFSE+ cells in naive mice) × 100. ELISPOT-IFNγ—Nitrocellulose microplates (Millipore) were coated with rat anti-mouse IFNγ antibody (R4-6A2, Pharmingen) and then washed and saturated with complete medium. Aliquots (in triplicate) of freshly isolated spleen cells (106 cells/well) or peripheral blood lymphocytes (2 × 105 cells/well) were added to the wells in complete medium containing 30 units/ml human rIL2 (Roche Applied Science) and 10–6m GP33 or NP366. After 20 h at 37 °C, the spot-forming cells were revealed and counted (10Molinier-Frenkel V. Lengagne R. Gaden F. Hong S.S. Choppin J. Gahery-Segard H. Boulanger P. Guillet J.G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The values obtained with NP366 were subtracted from the mean values of triplicate tests obtained with GP33. Cytotoxicity Assay—Splenocytes from DC-immunized mice (effector cells) were cultured for 4 days with 10–6m GP33. Effector cells were then assayed on 51Cr-labeled EL4 target cells (10–4 μCi/cell) pulsed with GP33 or NP366 peptide, in duplicate and at different effector-to-target ratios. After 5 h at 37 °C, supernatants were collected, and radioactivity was measured (Top Count, Packard Instruments). Target cells were incubated with medium alone to determine the level of spontaneous release of 51Cr and with 2% alkyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (Sigma) to determine the total 51Cr release. Specific 51Cr release was calculated using the formula: (experimental – spontaneous release)/(total release – spontaneous release) × 100. Effect of Isolated Ad5 Capsid Components on DC Phenotype—Immature DC were incubated with isolated Pn or Hx capsomers, purified from Ad5-infected HeLa cells. The major subset of Hx-treated DC showed a poorly mature phenotype, not significantly different from that shown by NS-DC, with a low expression of major histocompatibility complex class II, CD40, CD80 (B7.1), and CD86 (B7.2) molecules (Fig. 2a). In contrast, Pn-treated DC massively expressed a mature phenotype, similar to the phenotype of LPS-stimulated DC, with a high level of expression of the different markers (Fig. 2a). Since the Ad Pn capsomer is composed of two structural entities, Pb and Fi, the following experiments were designed to determine which of these two constitutive proteins was responsible for the DC maturation. DC were then treated with recombinant Pb or Fi protein isolated from insect cell extracts. The results indicated that isolated Fi protein reproduced the entire stimulatory effect of Pn, whereas Pb protein alone showed no detectable effect on DC maturation (Fig. 2b). Role of the Fiber Knob Domain in Fiber-mediated DC Maturation—The C-terminal domain of Ad fiber has been expressed as recombinant knob protein (26Novelli A. Boulanger P.A. Virology. 1991; 185: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Hong S.S. Karayan L. Tournier J. Curiel D.T. Boulanger P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2294-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). DC incubated with the fiber knob protein expressed a mature phenotype similar to that observed in DC stimulated by the full-length Fi (Fig. 3a). Consistent with this, the knob-stimulated DC were able to vigorously induce the proliferation of allogeneic CD4+ T cells in MLR experiments, an effect that occurred in a knob-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). At the higher knob protein dose used (0.5 μg), knob-stimulated DC were much more potent stimulators of allogeneic CD4+ T cells than control NS- or Hx-stimulated DC. However, there was an apparent threshold in the knob-mediated DC activation since a detectable effect was only observed at the dose of 0.2 μg of knob protein, i.e. 5 × 106 molecules of fiber knob per DC. Interestingly, the MLR values for 0.2 μg of knob protein were similar to that of 1 μg of Fi, a result consistent with the fact that the quantity of knob protein present in the 0.2-μg knob sample roughly corresponded to the knob protein content of the 1-μg Fi sample (180 amino acid residues for the knob domain versus 581 amino acid residues for the full-length fiber). The knob protein also induced IL12 and TNFα secretion in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3c). We then investigated whether the knob was capable of directly targeting DC and induce their maturation, without the participation of any other intermediate cells. To this aim, CD11c+ cells were purified using anti-CD11c magnetic beads and tested in maturation assays. Although NS-DC showed some up-regulation of expression of co-stimulatory molecules, knob-stimulated DC expressed a significantly more mature phenotype than control cells (Fig. 4a). Moreover, recombinant Fi protein was able to bind to immature DC, with 63% fiber-positive cells at day 6 of culture (Fig. 4b). In this assay, cell-bound Fi was detected using anti-fiber tail mAb, implying that the epitope in the tail was accessible and that the fiber attachment to the cell surface had occurred via the knob domain. These data strongly suggested that DC were direct targets for the fiber knob domain. To assess whether the effect of Ad5 virion on DC activation was also directly mediated by the fiber knob domain, comparative experiments were carried out using virions of AdE1°, carrying WT Fi projections, and of AdGFPΔknob, a knobless Ad5 vector (Fig. 1, a and b). Upon incubation with AdE1°, there was an up-regulation of the expression of maturation markers on DC (Fig. 4c), as expected from previous observations (15Hirschowitz E.A. Weaver J.D. Hidalgo G.E. Doherty D.E. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Morelli A.E. Larregina A.T. Ganster R.W. Zahorchak A.F. Plowey J.M. Takayama T. Logar A.J. Robbins P.D. Falo L.D. Thomson A.W. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 9617-9628Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). With the same doses of AdGFPΔknob virions, the DC showed a significantly less mature phenotype. These results confirmed that the fiber knob was the common stimulating factor in all the active viral components assessed, Ad5 virion, Pn capsomer, Fi, and knob proteins, and that the knob domain carried most of the determinants responsible for the stimulation of murine DC. Absence of CAR Expression at the Surface of Murine DC and Low Degree of Permissiveness to Ad5 Infection—The cell entry of Ad5 results from the attachment of the fiber knob to a high affinity primary receptor, identified as the CAR in most Adpermissive cells (24Santis G.

Mathias P. Cheresh D.A. Nemerow G.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 309-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar). It has already been shown that human and murine DC do not express CAR (17Réa D. Schagen F.H. Hoeben R.C. Mehtali M. Havenga M.J. Toes R.E. Melief C.J. Offringa R. J.

We verified by FACS analysis the level of CAR expression at the surface of DC differentiated in our culture conditions. HeLa cells, which are known to be high CAR expressors, were used as positive control, whereas Chinese hamster ovary cells, which do not express CAR, were used as negative control. As expected, no CAR signal above the background level could be detected on immature DC collected before stimulation (Fig. 5a), confirming previous observations. We thus checked whether knob stimulation of DC was associated with effective cell entry of Ad and Ad-mediated gene expression. AdGFP was used at two different m.o.i., 1 × 104 virions/cell, which was sufficient to induce DC maturation (Fig. 4c), and 3 × 104 virions/cell. At 48 h after infection at an m.o.i. of 104, only 12% of DC expressed GFP, and GFP expression slightly increased (19% of DC) at an m.o.i. of 3 × 104 (Fig. 5b), confirming that murine DC were poorly permissive to Ad5. Mapping of the Fiber Knob Region Involved in DC Maturation—Four Ad5 Fi protein mutants carrying deletions in the knob domain (Fig. 1, c and d) were assayed for DC maturation. The large deletion in recombinant FiΔ402–481 overlapped the AB loop, the β-strands B and C, the CD loop, and the N-terminal moiety of the DG loop, whereas FiΔHI mutant lacked only the HI loop. Two other recombinant Fi proteins, FiΔEF, and FiΔ485–486, carried deletions involving the short double β-stranded region EF, and the two residues Leu-485 and Thr-486, which form the β-sheet F (34Kirby I.

Here we show that MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression was induced during Caco-2 cell differentiation; thus this cell line was used as a model system to study the gene regulation unique for MAO B. Luciferase and gel shift assays showed that transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 binding to -246 and -99 bp were responsible for the observed gene activation. Overexpression of Sp3 inhibited the induction of MAO B gene by Sp1, and the expression of Sp3 was decreased during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Computer analysis revealed a putative CpG island containing 22 potential CpG methylation sites between -261 and -58 bp. In vitro methylation of MAO B promoter with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, up-regulated MAO B gene expression in both HeLa and Caco-2 cells. Sodium bisulfite sequencing showed a gradually reduced methylation of the CpG sites during Caco-2 cell differentiation. These results suggested that MAO B gene expression is selectively induced by a decreased Sp3/Sp1 ratio and reduced DNA methylation. This new information may provide insights on the tissue-specific expression of these two isoenzymes. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B catalyze the oxidative deamination of neuroactive and dietary monoamines such as serotonin, tyramine, and phenylethylamine. Here we show that MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression was induced during Caco-2 cell differentiation; thus this cell line was used as a model system to study the gene regulation unique for MAO B. Luciferase and gel shift assays showed that transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 binding to -246 and -99 bp were responsible for the observed gene activation. Overexpression of Sp3 inhibited the induction of MAO B gene by Sp1, and the expression of Sp3 was decreased during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Computer analysis revealed a putative CpG island containing 22 potential CpG methylation sites between -261 and -58 bp. In vitro methylation of MAO B promoter with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, up-regulated MAO B gene expression in both HeLa and Caco-2 cells. Sodium bisulfite sequencing showed a gradually reduced methylation of the CpG sites during Caco-2 cell differentiation. These results suggested that MAO B gene expression is selectively induced by a decreased Sp3/Sp1 ratio and reduced DNA methylation. This new information may provide insights on the tissue-specific expression of these two isoenzymes.

MAO is present in two isoforms, MAO A and MAO B, which are encoded by two closely linked genes on the X chromosome (3Lan N.C. Heinzmann C. Gal A. Klisak I. Orth U. Lai E. Grimsby J. Sparkes R.S.

MAO A preferentially oxidizes serotonin and norepinephrine and is inhibited by low concentrations of clorgyline (6Johnston J.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 1285-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar). MAO B has higher affinity for substrates phenylethylamine and benzylamine and is inhibited by low concentrations of deprenyl (7Knoll J. Magyar K. Adv. Biochem. Psychopharmacol. 1972; 5: 393-408PubMed Google Scholar). Active sites of MAO A and B have been extensively studied (8Wu H.F. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol.

The studies of MAO A and MAO B knockout mice have clearly demonstrated that these isoenzymes have distinct functions in monoamine metabolism and play important roles in behavioral and neurological disorders (17Cases O.

The human brain MAOs have been implicated in a number of psychiatric and neurological disorders and targeted for drugs against depression and Parkinson's disease (19Saura J. Luque J.M. Cesura A.M.

VSP Press, Utrecht1993: 219-247Google Scholar). MAO regulates the levels of serotonin in both the central and enteric nervous systems. It has been shown that serotonin plays important roles in the gut (21Gershon M.D. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 15-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gershon M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G869-G873PubMed Google Scholar) and is implicated for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (23Gershon M.D. Rev. Gastroenterol. Disord. 2003; 3: S25-S34PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two genes remain largely unknown. MAO A and B are co-expressed in most human tissues and are most abundant in the intestine (24Grimsby J. Lan N.C. Neve R. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, fibroblasts and placenta express only MAO A (25Weyler W. Salach J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13199-13207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Egashira T. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1976; 26: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, platelets and lymphocytes express only MAO B (27Bond P.A. Cundall R.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1977; 80: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the human brain MAO A is found in catecholaminergic neurons; surprisingly MAO B, instead of MAO A, is in serotonergic neurons and astrocytes (28Westlund K.N. Denney R.M. Rose R.M. Abell C.W. Science. 1985; 230: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 29Levitt P. Pintar J.E. Breakefield X.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6385-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). To understand the tissue-specific expression of MAO A and B, it is important to study the regulation of their gene expression. We have previously characterized the promoter regions of MAO A and MAO B genes and shown that they have a different promoter organization. The MAO A core promoter consists of three binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 in reversed orientations and lacks a TATA box. In contrast, the MAO B core promoter contains a TATA box and two clusters of Sp1 binding sites separated by a CACCC box (30Zhu Q.S. Grimsby J. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zhu Q.S. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurosci. 1994; 12: 7393-7403Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that both transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 interact with the two clusters of Sp1 binding sites within the MAO B core promoter. In addition, overexpression of Sp1 transactivates promoter activity through the proximal cluster of Sp1 binding sites (32Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The promoter activation by Sp1 could be inhibited by overexpression of Sp3. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression is induced by the activation of protein kinase C and mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathway involving the transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, c-Jun, and Egr-1 (33Wong W.K. Ou X.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22222-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the gene regulation of MAO A and MAO B appears to be distinct and complex. This has led us to further investigate the transcriptional regulation of these genes. In the present study, we have found that the Caco-2 cell line (human colon adenocarcinoma) expressed both MAO A and MAO B. However, the expression of MAO B, but not MAO A, was progressively increased when the cells were undergoing differentiation. The Caco-2 cells undergo cell cycle arrest and differentiation after reaching confluence (12Geha R.M. Chen K. Shih J.C. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Zhou B.P. Wu B. Kwan S.W. Abell C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14862-14868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Promoter deletion and reporter gene expression studies have identified the MAO B core promoter region (-246/-99 bp) as crucial for the induced gene expression during Caco-2 cell differentiation. In addition, the transcriptional repressor Sp3 for MAO B promoter was significantly down-regulated during the activation of MAO B gene expression. Within this promoter region, we have identified a 204-bp CpG island and 22 potential CpG methylation sites, suggesting that cytosine methylation plays a role in the transcriptional activation of MAO B gene. Indeed, sodium bisulfite sequencing showed a progressively decreased methylation status of the CpG sites in MAO B core promoter during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Northern blot analysis showed that treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, up-regulated MAO B transcript levels in undifferentiated Caco-2 cells and HeLa cells. These results demonstrated that the up-regulation of MAO B gene expression is modulated by down-regulation of transcriptional repressor Sp3 and modifications of promoter methylation during Caco-2 cell differentiation. This is the first study demonstrating the regulation of MAO B gene expression by Sp3 level and DNA methylation downstream of signaling pathways. Cell lines and Reagents—The Caco-2 (human colonic adenocarcinoma) and HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Sodium bisulfite, hydroquinone, and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Polyclonal antisera against Sp1 and Sp3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human MAO B Promoter-luciferase Reporter Constructs—The BamHI/BamHI MAO B promoter fragment (-2099/-99 bp) was cloned into the polylinker site (BglII) upstream of the luciferase gene (LUC) in the pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Serial deletion constructs were generated by restriction enzyme digestion using the -2099/-99LUC as a template followed by Klenow fill-in and selfligation. The following restriction enzymes were used to generate the deletion constructs: XhoI/AspI (pGLB-1313); XhoI/BglII (pGLB-1180); XhoI/SpeI (pGLB-868); XhoI/ApaI (pGLB-425); XhoI/PstI (pGLB-246). MAO Catalytic Activity Assay—One hundred micrograms of total proteins were incubated with 100 μm14C-labeled serotonin (5-hy-droxytrytamine) (for MAO A) or 10 μm14C-labeled PEA (for MAO B) (Amersham Biosciences) in the assay buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 20 min and terminated by addition of 100 μl of 6 n HCl. The reaction products were then extracted with benzene/ethyl acetate (1:1) (for MAO A) or water-saturated ethyl acetate/toluene (1:1) (for MAO B) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The organic phase containing the reaction product was extracted, and its radioactivity was obtained by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA were purified using TRIzol reagents (Invitrogen). Thirty micrograms of total RNA was loaded onto each gel lane. Electrophoresis, transfer onto BrightStar nylon membrane, and hybridization were carried out using NorthernMax according to the manufacturer's protocol (Ambion). The human MAO A and MAO B cDNA probes and an internal control probe encoding human β-actin were labeled by random-priming technique using the Multiprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Membrane hybridized with the MAO A or MAO B probe was autoradiographed for 72 h. When the β-actin control probe was used, membrane was autoradiographed for 1 h. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). For MAO A and B detection, 100 μg of total proteins was separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After the transfer, membranes were blocked at room temperature for 2 h with 5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were then incubated with anti-MAO A or anti-MAO B antibodies (1:1000) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in TTBS overnight at room temperature. After incubation with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h, the bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase reaction DAB (Sigma). Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Gel Shift Assay— Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, and pelleted. Cells were resuspended in a 5-pellet volume of buffer A (10 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min. Pellets were then resuspended in a 3-pellet volume of buffer A plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40, incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol) and incubated on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking. Nuclear proteins were then centrifuged for 30 min and dialyzed for 4 h at 4 °C against 1 liter of buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% glycerol). Protein extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. Protein concentrations were determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay. MAO B promoter DNA fragment (-246/-99 bp) was radiolabeled by Klenow fill-in and purified by gel electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide) and eluted in TE. For DNA-protein binding, 5 μg of nuclear extracts were diluted in binding buffer (40 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma)) with a total volume of 20 μl. Antibodies against Sp1 or Sp3 were added (when required), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Labeled probes (0.2 ng) were added to the mixture and incubated for additional 20 min at room temperature. The samples were then run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate/EDTA at 150 V for 3 h. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Sodium Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—10-μg aliquots of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from cells were denatured in 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min in a total volume of 50 μl. Sulfonation and hydrolytic deamination reactions were then carried out by adding 450 μl of 2.5 m sodium bisulfite (Na2S2O5)/10 mm hydroquinone solution (pH 5.0) to the digested genomic DNA and incubating at 50 °C for 4 h in the dark. Bisulfite-converted DNA was purified using a QIAquick spin purification kit (Qiagen) and eluted with TE according to the manufacturer's protocol. Desulfonation reactions were then performed in 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 15 min, and DNA was precipitated with 3 m sodium acetate/ethanol and resuspended in 100 μl of water. PCR amplification was performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 5 μl of bisulfite-treated genomic DNA, 0.5 μm primers, 100 μm dNTPs, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were: 97 °C for 4 min (1 cycle) and 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). The following primers were used: 5′-GCCTTCCTGACTTAATCAC-3′ (MAO B, forward -752) and 5′-CCTCGATCCCAGTCCTGCC-3′ (MAO B, reverse -55). Amplified DNA was subcloned into vector pCR2.1 using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfections were performed using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Exponentially growing cells were plated at a density of 4 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 2 ml of DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum and grown until 60% confluent (24–36 h). Plasmids were mixed with 100 μl of serum-free and antibiotic-free medium, and 10 μl of SuperFect reagent. Following a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 600 μl of DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics) were added to the DNA-SuperFect complexes. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with DNA-SuperFect complexes. After 2-h incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with DMEM (10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics). Cells were harvested 48 h later with Luciferase Assay lysis buffer (Promega). The cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase using the Promega dual luciferase assay system following the manufacturer's instructions. For DNA methylation studies, promoter fragments for MAO B(-246/-99 bp) were digested with PstI and HindIII, gel-isolated, and then in vitro methylated with SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine according to manufacturer's protocol. The procedure for mock methylation is identical to the one for DNA methylation except no methylase was included. Complete methylation of the fragments was confirmed by the HpaII and HhaI methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion. The luciferase vector was digested with PstI and HindIII and ligated with an equimolar concentration of methylated or unmethylated promoter fragments. One microgram of methylated or unmethylated MAO B promoter-reporter constructs was co-transfected into the cells with 20 ng of pRL-TK (internal control, Promega). For the co-transfection experiments, the Sp1 expression plasmid (pCMV-Sp1) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Tjian, and the Sp3 expression plasmid (pCMV-Sp3) was a generous gift from Dr. Guntram Suske. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by the addition of the empty expression vector pCMV. CpG Analysis—The presence of a CpG island was analyzed with the EMBOSS program CpGplot (available at www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/cpgplot.html). This program detects regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG pattern known as CpG islands. The program defines a CpG island as a region where the moving average of percentage of G + C nucleotides is greater than 50 and the moving average of observed/expected CpG is greater than 0.6 within a minimum of 200 bases. Statistical Analysis—All values were presented as means ± S.E. Student t test was used for statistical analysis, and differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. Increased MAO B but Not MAO A Gene Expression during Caco-2 Cell Differentiation—To determine the expression of MAO A and MAO B during Caco-2 cell differentiation, we cultured the Caco-2 cells at various growth stages (pre-confluence; confluence, day 0; post-confluence, days 2, 7, and 14). Radiochemical and enzymatic assays using enzyme-specific 14C-labeled substrates serotonin (5-hydroxytrytamine) and phenylethylamine for MAO A and MAO B, respectively, indicated that both MAO A and MAO B were expressed as early as 2 days before cells reached confluence (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, MAO B enzymatic activity increased when the cells reached confluence (day 0) and continued to increase progressively after confluence during cellular differentiation (days 7 and 14). In contrast, the enzymatic activity of MAO A remained relatively unchanged during the course of differentiation. These enzymatic activities were specific to MAO A and MAO B as indicated by the selective inhibition of these enzymes by clorgyline and deprenyl, respectively (data not shown). Northern and Western blot analyses revealed that the specific increase of MAO B enzymatic activity correlated with the increased level of MAO B mRNA transcript and protein (Fig. 1, B and C) at confluent and post-confluent states. In contrast, the levels of MAO A transcript and protein remained relatively unchanged. The major MAO A transcripts of 5 and 2 kb, and MAO B transcript of 3 kb were detected with their specific probes as early as 2 days before confluence, indicating that both MAO genes were constitutively expressed in the proliferating Caco-2 cells. The induced level of MAO B mRNA transcript was followed by the increased level of MAO B protein. These data suggested that MAO B, but not MAO A, gene expression was selectively induced during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Identification of Essential Regulatory Region for MAO B Gene Activation—Promoter deletion and reporter gene assay were performed to map the regulatory region responsible for the increased MAO B gene expression during Caco-2 cell differentiation. The 5′-flanking regulatory sequence of MAO B gene was gradually truncated to generate a series of promoter fragments. The deleted promoter fragments were then ligated to the upstream sequence of firefly luciferase reporter gene (pGL2-Basic) and transiently transfected into pre-confluent (2 days before confluence) or differentiating (days 7 and 14) Caco-2 cells. The MAO B promoter activity was determined by the relative expression level of firefly luciferase reporter gene using the expression level of co-transfected Renilla firefly luciferase reporter gene as an internal control to normalize the transfection efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2, increased MAO B promoter activity was found to correlated with the states of differentiation except the promoter construct pB-2099/-246 that lacked the core promoter. This promoter construct had similar activity to that of the control promoter-less vector (pGL2-Basic), indicating that the promoter region between -246 and -99 was essential for the induced MAO B promoter activity during Caco-2 cell differentiation. (A similar correlation between MAO B promoter activity and level of gene expression was also found in HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma), 1242-MG (human glioma), and HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma) cell lines (data not shown). These data indicated that Caco-2 cell is a suitable model system to study the MAO B gene regulation.) Interestingly, the pattern of progressively increasing promoter activity was increased progressively from pre-confluence to days 7 and 14, similar to increasing levels of MAO B catalytic activity in RNA and protein levels (Fig. 1). This result indicates that MAO B promoter activity was correlated with the differentiation states of Caco-2 cells, and the regulatory region between -246 and -99 was essential for the MAO B gene up-regulation. Characterization of Nuclear Factors Binding to MAO B Core Promoter during Differentiation—EMSA, coupled with supershift assays, was performed to characterize the transcription factors that interact with the MAO B core promoter region. The nuclear proteins from pre-confluent (PC), confluent (day 0), and post-confluent (days 7 and 14) were extracted and incubated with 32P-labeled MAO B promoter fragment between -246 and -99 bp. Five shifted bands (I, II, III, IV, and V) were observed. Interestingly, the intensity of complexes I and III gradually decreased (lanes 1–4) and disappeared in day 14 (lane 4, Fig. 3A). To further characterize the complexes, we performed a supershift assay by using antibodies raised against transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 proteins, and nuclear proteins from pre-confluent cells. The complex II was supershifted by the addition of Sp1 antibody (lane 2), whereas the complexes I and III were supershifted by the addition of Sp3 antibody (lane 3) (Fig. 3B). Addition of both Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies supershifted complexes I–III. The gradually decreased intensity of complexes I and III suggested that the expression of Sp3 was reduced during Caco-2 cell differentiation. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the expression levels of Sp1 and Sp3 in Caco-2 cells. The nuclear proteins from pre-confluent (PC), confluent (day 0), and post-confluent (days 7 and 14) Caco-2 cells were extracted and analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3C, although the expression level of Sp1 decreased when cells reach confluence, its expression level appeared relatively the same during differentiation from day 0 to day 14. In contrast, the expression level of Sp3 gradually decreased throughout the course of differentiation. This decreased expression level of Sp3 protein may explain the reduced intensity of complexes I and III in EMSA. Functional Analysis of Sp1 and Sp3 on MAO B Promoter Activity in Caco-2 Cells—The decreased expression of transcription factor Sp3 correlated inversely with the increased MAO B gene expression during Caco-2 cell differentiation. The MAO B core promoter consisted of two clusters of overlapping binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 or Sp3. To determine the functional roles of Sp1 and Sp3 in the up-regulation of MAO B gene expression in Caco-2 cells, the core promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct (pB-246/-99) was transiently cotransfected with increasing amounts of cDNA plasmids expressing the human Sp1 or Sp3 in pre-confluent Caco-2 cells. Overexpression of Sp1 enhanced MAO B promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). In contrast, overexpression of Sp3 resulted in a slight decrease of promoter activity. Because the binding sites were overlapped, competition between Sp1 and Sp3 for binding to these sites may influence the overall MAO B promoter activity. To determine whether an interplay exists between Sp1 and Sp3 on promoter activity, transient co-transfection experiments were performed using a constant amount of Sp1 expression plasmid along with gradually increasing amounts of Sp3 expression plasmids. As expected, expression of Sp1 enhanced MAO B promoter activity. However, the Sp1-mediated promoter activation was gradually reduced by increasing amounts of Sp3 expression (Fig. 4). The result of Sp3 suppression of MAO B promoter was found in other cell lines such as 1243-MG (human glioma), HepG2 (human hepatocytoma), and HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma) (32Wong W.K. Chen K. Shih J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that variation in the ratio of Sp1 and Sp3 expression might influence the regulation of MAO B gene expression. Reduced Promoter Methylation during Caco-2 Cell Differentiation—MAO B promoter region between -246 and -99 bp was GC-rich. We analyzed the CpG dinucleotide distribution and found a potential CpG island within the middle of this region using the program CpGPlot (Fig. 5A). Twenty-two CpG sites were located in this promoter region. The effect of in vitro methylation on the promoter activity of MAO B gene was tested in a transient expression assay using the pB-246/-99 promoter-reporter gene construct. After methylation with SssI methylase, which methylated cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides, the methylated and unmethylated reporter constructs were transiently transfected into pre- and post-confluent Caco-2 cells and assayed for promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 5B, in vitro methylation almost completely suppressed MAO B promoter activity compare"
https://openalex.org/W2012650432,"The mechanisms by which p53 prevents development of cancer are much more complicated than previously thought. Under normal conditions, p53 is involved in cell-cycle arrest, Q1apoptosis, DNA repair, and inhibition of angiogenesis; it also promotes degradation of proteins through transcriptional regulation of certain target genes. Here we report the isolation of a novel transcriptional target of p53, designated p53RFP (p53-inducible RING-finger protein), whose product has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Its expression was negatively correlated to that of p21(WAF1) protein; p53RFP is likely to play a role in the regulation of this protein, probably through interaction with, and ubiquitination of, p21(WAF1). p53RFP appears to represent the second known example, the first being MDM2, of an E3 ubiquitin ligase as a p53 target. Our results further suggest that p53 might regulate the stability of p21(WAF1) through transcriptional regulation of p53RFP, and this feature may represent a novel mechanism for a p53-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint."
https://openalex.org/W2139398990,"The type 1 carbohydrate chain, Galβ1–3GlcNAc, is synthesized by UDP-galactose:β-N-acetylglucosamine β1,3-galactosyltransferase (β3Gal-T). Among six β3Gal-Ts cloned to date, β3Gal-T5 is an essential enzyme for the synthesis of type 1 chain in epithelium of digestive tracts or pancreatic tissue. It forms the type 1 structure on glycoproteins produced from such tissues. In the present study, we found that the transcriptional regulation of the β3Gal-T5 gene is controlled by homeoproteins, i.e. members of caudal-related homeobox protein (Cdx) and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) families. We found an important region (–151 to –121 from the transcription initiation site), named the β3Gal-T5 control element (GCE), for the promoter activity. GCE contained the consensus sequences for members of the Cdx and HNF families. Mutations introduced into this sequence abolished the transcriptional activity. Four factors, Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β, could bind to GCE and transcriptionally activate the β3Gal-T5 gene. Transcriptional regulation of the β3Gal-T5 gene was consistent with that of members of the Cdx and HNF1 families in two in vivo systems. 1) During in vitro differentiation of Caco-2 cells, transcriptional up-regulation of β3Gal-T5 was observed in correlation with the increase in transcripts for Cdx2 and HNF1α. 2) Both transcript and protein levels of β3Gal-T5 were determined to be significantly reduced in colon cancer. This down-regulation was correlated with the decrease of Cdx1 and HNF1β expression in cancer tissue. This is the first finding that a glycosyltransferase gene is transcriptionally regulated under the control of homeoproteins in a tissue-specific manner. β3Gal-T5, controlled by the intestinal homeoproteins, may play an important role in the specific function of intestinal cells by modifying the carbohydrate structure of glycoproteins.

Carbohydrate antigens are involved in many biological events. Among the antigens, Lewis antigens, which have Galβ1–3/4GlcNAcβ-as a backbone structure, are the major ones expressed in human tissue. Whereas the type 2 (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ-) structure is distributed ubiquitously, the type 1 (Galβ1–3GlcNAcβ-) structure is synthesized only in certain tissues, such as epithelium of the digestive tracts or pancreatic tissue. This restricted distribution of Lewis type 1 antigens has been considered to be the result of the limited expression of UDP-Gal:GlcNAc β1,3-galactosyltransferases (β3Gal-Ts), 1The abbreviations used are: β3Gal-T, β1,3-galactosyltransferase; β4Gal-T, β1,4-galactosyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; HNF, hepatocyte nuclear factor; sLea, sialyl Lewis a; Lea, Lewis a; Leb, Lewis b; Lex, Lewis x; Ley, Lewis y; SI, sucrase-isomaltase; LPH, lactose-phlorizin hydrolase; GCE, β3Gal-T5 control element; RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Cdx, caudal-related homeobox protein. which synthesize the type 1 structure. Sialyl Lewis a (sLea), known as CA19-9 antigen in the clinical field, belongs to the Lewis type 1 antigens. CA19-9 is one of the most useful tumor markers and shown to be frequently accumulated in sera of colonic and pancreatic cancer patients (1Magnani J.L. Steplewski Z. Koprowski H. Ginsburg V. Cancer Res. 1983; 43: 5489-5492PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously (2Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) the molecular cloning of β3Gal-T5 and presented evidence that this enzyme is responsible for the synthesis of Lewis type 1 antigens in colonic mucosa, pancreatic tissue, and cell lines derived from them. Moreover, we showed that the amount of type 1 antigen, such as CA19-9, on glycoproteins was well correlated with the β3Gal-T5 transcript level in these cell lines, suggesting that the transcriptional control of β3Gal-T5 might be the major regulatory factor for the synthesis of the Lewis type 1 structure. This enzyme efficiently acts on glycolipids as well as N-linked glycoproteins such as carcinoembryonic antigen, a well known tumor marker, and arranges its carbohydrate composition (3Salvini R. Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3564-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to the activity for synthesizing the type 1 structure, β3Gal-T5 can transfer a galactose in the β1,3-linkage to the mucin core-3 structure (GlcNAcβ1–3GalNAcα-) which is abundantly expressed in colonic epithelium (4Zhou D. Berger E.G. Hennet T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 571-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been reported that alterations of glycosyltransferase activity give rise to a dramatic modification of carbohydrate structures in several biological processes, such as differentiation and carcinogenesis. Caco-2 cells, derived from colon adenocarcinoma, have been frequently used as a model for intestinal differentiation because of their unique character, i.e. spontaneous differentiation into enterocyte-like cells as defined morphologically and enzymologically. In this process, β3Gal-T activity is up-regulated (5Amano J. Kobayashi K. Oshima M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), resulting in an increase in the type 1 structure (6Amano J. Oshima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21209-21216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is not yet clarified which β3Gal-T is responsible for the β3Gal-T activity in Caco-2 cells. In colon cancer tissue, β3Gal-T activity toward N-glycan and glycolipids significantly decreased as compared with normal mucosa, whereas β4Gal-T activity was essentially unchanged (7Seko A. Ohkura T. Kitamura H. Yonezawa S. Sato E. Yamashita K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3468-3473PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of β3Gal-T5 transcription in colon cancer was also reported (3Salvini R. Bardoni A. Valli M. Trinchera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 3564-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that β3Gal-T5 directs β3Gal-T activity in colonic epithelium and is transcriptionally down-regulated in cancer. The tissue-specific expression and unique acceptor substrate specificity of β3Gal-T5 and the alteration in β3Gal-T activity during carcinogenesis and intestinal cell differentiation suggested its biological importance, which prompted us to examine the molecular basis for the transcriptional regulation of the β3Gal-T5. In a previous study, we determined the organization of β3Gal-T5 gene and the transcription initiation site by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method, and we found several consensus sequences for known transcription factors within about 200 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site by computer analysis (2Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, we carried out the present study to identify essential transcription factors for the β3Gal-T5 gene, and we found that the intestine-specific transcription factors, Cdx and HNF1, were functional in transcriptional activation for β3Gal-T5. We also examined the alteration of β3Gal-T5 expression upon intestinal differentiation and carcinogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Cell Cultures—All cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. For differentiation experiments using Caco-2 cells, 2 mm sodium butyrate (Sigma) was added to the medium after confluence. Cells were harvested just before confluence and 2 or 4 weeks after confluence and stored at –80 °C until total RNA isolation. Cloning of cDNA for Homeoproteins and Expression in COS-1 Cells— Complementary DNAs for homeoproteins Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β, were obtained with PCR using Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Their entire sequences were verified by sequencing. Sequences of primers are listed in Table I. These plasmids were also used as standard DNA for quantitative RT-PCR analysis.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for the cDNA cloning and quantitative PCRGenesForwardReversePrimer sequences used for PCR cloning of homeoproteinsCDX1CTGAATTCACCATGTATGTGGGCTATGTGCCTAAGCTTGCTATGGCAGAAACTCCTCTTTCDX2CTGAATTCACCATGTACGTGAGCTACCTCCCTAAGCTTTCACTGGGTGACGGTGGGGTTTHNF1αGCGAATTCGCCATGGTTTCTAAACTGAGCCGCGAATTCTGGTTACTGGGAGGAAGAGGCCHNF1βGCGAATTCGAAAATGGTGTCCAAGCTCACGGCGAATTCGGCATCACCAGGCTTGTAGAGGPrimer sequences used for quantitative PCRCDX1AATCCGGCGGAAATCAGAGCTGGTTCACTTTGCGCTCCTTTGCCCDX2ATCCGGAGGAAAGCCGAGCTAGCTGTTGCTGCTGCAACTTCTTCHNF1αCCGCAGACTATGCTCATCACCGGCGTGTGAAGCCCGGACTCACTHNF1βCTCCAACCAGACTCACAGCCTGCATGGCGCTGTTGCCATGGTGAβ3Gal-T5GAGCATTCTACACTGACAGTTCAATACAAACAAAGAGCCCCCAGGenesFITCLC-Red640Fluorescence-labelled probe sequences used for quantitative PCRCDX1CCAATCTGGGGCTCACTGAACGGCAGGTGAAGATCTGGTTCCAACDX2GCTCTCTGAGAGGCAGGTTAAAATCTGGTTTCAGAACCGCAGAGHNF1CAGCCTCACGCCCACCAAGCAGGTCTTCACCTCAGACACTGAGGHNF1βTCTCCTCCAAACAAGCTGTCAGGAGTGCGCTACAGCCAGCAGGGβ3Gal-T5ATGGCTTTCCCGAAGATGAGATGGTTCCTCTTACCCAGCAAAAA Open table in a new tab For the expression of homeoproteins in COS-1 cells, ∼1 × 106 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of the expression plasmid for each well of a 6-well plate, according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested after 24 h and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments. Tissue Samples—Twenty nine pairs of colon cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa were obtained from surgically resected specimens. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. The specimens were clinically and pathologically examined and diagnosed as adenocarcinoma arising from the colon. The tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until total RNA isolation. Preparation of cDNA and Quantification of Transcript—Total RNA was isolated from tissue specimens and cell lines with the acid/guanidine/phenol/chloroform extraction method. Complementary DNAs were synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer from 5 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl (total volume) reaction mixture using a Superscript Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA Synthesis (Invitrogen). After cDNA synthesis, the reaction mixture was diluted 50-fold with water and then stored at –80 °C until use. The quantitative RT-PCR using the LightCycler real time PCR instrument (Roche Applied Science) was performed according to the distributor's manual. Standard plasmids of Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β were prepared with PCR cloning as described above. The sequences of primers and fluorescent (fluorescein isothiocyanate and LC-Red 640) probes for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in Table I. Primers were designed to be located in different exons and not to detect contaminated genomic DNA. After 5 min of preheating, 50 cycles of PCR were performed. Each cycle consisted of 0 s of denaturing at 95 °C, 5 s of annealing at 55 °C, and 10 s of extension at 72 °C. Reporter Plasmid Constructs—The cosmid human genomic library, kindly provided by Dr. H. Inoko (Tokai University, Kanagawa, Japan), was screened by hybridization with a full-length β3Gal-T5 cDNA as a probe. Two clones out of three positives were found to contain the β3Gal-T5 exon 1 by restriction mapping and Southern blotting. A 3.8-kbp XbaI fragment containing exon 1 was subcloned into pBluescript SK(–) (Stratagene). As the 3′-end of this fragment was located within the first intron, a SalI/EcoRI fragment, containing the 2.9-kbp 5′-flanking region and 5′-half of the first exon, was subcloned into pBlue-script and subsequently subcloned into the KpnI and SacI sites of the pGL3 basic vector (Promega) for promoter assay. Several deletion mutants were prepared by appropriate restriction enzyme digestion and self-ligation. Smaller mutants (<200 bp) were cloned by PCR, and entire sequences were verified by sequencing. A site-directed mutation in the homeoprotein consensus sequence was introduced into a 200-bp HincII/EcoRI construct (containing from –151 to +49 of the promoter region) with a PCR-based mutagenesis kit (Takara). Reporter Assay—Approximately 24 h before transfection, cells were removed with trypsin, and ∼5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. Cells were transfected using the lipofection method with LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen), 0.5 μg of reporter plasmid (pGL3), and 10 ng of internal reference plasmid pRL-CMV, according to the manufacturer's protocol. For co-transfection experiments, 0.5 μg of the expression vector was transfected together with reporter vectors. Twenty four hours later, reporter activity was quantified with a Dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). The luciferase activity was normalized to an internal reference activity for each well, and the average for at least three experiments was shown as relative light units. Nuclear Protein Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (8Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Radiolabeling of probe oligonucleotides and protein-DNA binding reactions were performed using a BandShift kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, protein-DNA binding reactions were performed in the reaction buffer (10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), including 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and 50,000 cpm of probe. Reactions were initiated by the addition of nuclear extract and run for 30 min at room temperature to form protein-nucleotide complexes that were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TAE running buffer (40 mmol/liter Tris acetate, 1 mmol/liter EDTA (pH 8.3)). Gels were dried before the visualization of radiolabeled complexes with a BAS2000 image analyzer. For competition assays, unlabeled competitor was added to the reaction mixtures at a 100-fold molar excess of the concentration of labeled probe before the addition of the nuclear extract. Supershift assays were performed by adding 1 μl of antibody (anti-HNF1α; sc-6547, anti-HNF1β; sc-7411, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after an initial incubation period of 30 min. The incubation was then continued for an additional 30 min. Preparation of Anti β3Gal-T5 Monoclonal Antibody—A partial cDNA encoding a truncated β3Gal-T5, which lacks a cytoplasmic tail and a transmembrane domain, was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned in a pBluescript vector. The insert was subsequently subcloned in pET14b bacterial expression vector (Promega). The recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli accumulated in the insoluble fraction. The inclusion body was solubilized and dialyzed; rats were immunized with dialysate, and the production and screening of hybridomas were performed as described previously. Finally, a monoclonal antibody reacting to the recombinant β3Gal-T5 protein was established. Immunological specificity was confirmed by immunostaining and Western blotting using Namalwa cells which express β3Gal-T1 to -T5 (2Isshiki S. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe M. Kubota T. Kitajima M. Shiraishi N. Sasaki K. Andoh T. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12499-12507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical Staining—Small intestine, stomach, and normal and cancerous colon tissues were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Deparaffinized 4-μm sections of the tissues were washed in PBS three times. For antigen retrieval, they were heated in 10 mm citrate buffer (pH 7.0) by autoclave at 121 °C for 10 min. They were treated with 0.3% (v/v) H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase and then washed in PBS three times. To block nonspecific staining, they were incubated for 20 min with 1.5% normal rabbit serum in PBS at room temperature. Antigen detection was carried out by applying anti-β3Gal-T5 monoclonal antibody (rat IgG) at 2 μg/ml for 16 h at 4 °C, followed by the streptavidin-biotin complex method (Elite ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories). The specimens were washed with PBS between each step, and 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidene (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) was used for the peroxidase reaction. Nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Identification of the cis-Element Required for Activation of β3Gal-T5—To determine the region essential for the transcriptional regulation of β3Gal-T5, we isolated a genomic clone encompassing the β3Gal-T5 promoter region (about 2.9 kbp in length) for a reporter assay. We constructed several deletion plasmids containing various lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the β3Gal-T5 gene and examined the reporter activity with the two types of cells expressing or non-expressing β3Gal-T5, SW1116, or HCT-15, both of which were derived from colon cancer. As shown in Fig. 1, reporter plasmids containing –2951 to –151 bp of the 5′-flanking region induced a 35–90-fold increase above the promoterless reporter plasmid in relative luciferase activity, whereas plasmids containing –121 to –31 achieved only a 3–8-fold increase when assayed with SW1116 cells (β3Gal-T5 expressing cells). This result revealed that the 30-bp region, from –151 to –121, is important for the promoter activity; therefore we designated this region the “β3Gal-T5 control element” (GCE). By analysis using TRANSFAC, a data base of transcription factor binding sites (www.transfac.gbf.de/), we found that the promoter region, from –151 to –1, contains several consensus binding sites for known transcription factors, such as Cdx, HNF1, C/EBP, AP-1, and GATA etc. (Fig. 2). Two Cdx consensus sequences (ATAAA and ATTAT in Fig. 2), named as Cdx(A) and Cdx(B), were found in this region. The Cdx(A) site, overlapped by a putative HNF1-binding site (ATTAATAAATACC in Fig. 2), was located within the GCE, whereas the Cdx(B) site was downstream of GCE. A site-directed mutation was separately introduced in each Cdx-binding site to destroy it, and the mutant constructs were designated “–151m1” and “–151m2,” respectively. When a 4-bp mutation was introduced to the Cdx(A) site (–151m1), the promoter activity decreased in 20% of wild-type construct (“–151”), whereas the mutation in the Cdx(B) site (–151m2) essentially did not affect the activity (Fig. 1). When assayed with HCT-15 cells that did not express β3Gal-T5, deletion (“–121”) or mutation (–151m1) of GCE did not exert for the promoter activity. This significant difference between two types of cells indicated that GCE is the most important cis-element for promoter activity of β3Gal-T5.Fig. 2Sequence analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the human β3Gal-T5 gene. Potential binding motifs for known transcription factors are underlined with heavy bar. The mutation sequences introduced in the –151m1 and –151m2 constructs are double underlined. The region for the β3Gal-T5 control element (GCE) is boxed. The transcription initiation site is indicated by an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Identification of Transcription Factors Essential for Regulation of β3Gal-T5—For further characterization of transcription factors that bind to GCE, EMSA was performed. When the radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the GCE sequence was reacted with the nuclear extract of SW1116 cells, two bands were observed (Fig. 3). The specific binding to GCE was confirmed by the disappearance of the bands when an excess of non-radiolabeled GCE probe was added as a competitor. The lower band disappeared when an excess of SIF1, a Cdx-binding oligonucleotide from the sucrase-isomaltase promoter (9Suh E. Chen L. Taylor J. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7340-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), was added as an unlabeled competitor, although the upper band did not disappear. Addition of anti-HNF1α antibody to the EMSA reaction mixture resulted in a supershift of the upper band but not the lower band. On the other hand, anti-HNF1β antibody did not shift any bands. Thus, the upper band in this EMSA experiment using the SW1116 nuclear extracts was identified as a GCE-HNF1α complex, and the lower band was indicated to be a GCE-Cdx1 and/or Cdx2 complex. Four homeoproteins, Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β, were cloned in an expression vector in this study, and each of them was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. The nuclear extracts of COS-1 cells expressing Cdx1 or Cdx2 formed a complex with the GCE probe, which appeared as a band almost at the same migration length as the lower band in the previous SW1116 experiment (Fig. 4). These results further indicated that the lower band in the SW1116 EMSA experiment is a GCE-Cdx1 and/or Cdx2 complex. Specific protein-DNA complexes were also observed when reactions were performed with nuclear extract of COS-1 cells expressing HNF1α or HNF1β protein, and the complex of GCE-HNF1α appeared at the same position as the upper band in the SW1116 experiment (Fig. 4). The complex of GCE-HNF1β appeared at a position slightly lower than that of GCE-HNF1α. As shown with asterisks in Fig. 4, nonspecific bands were observed, which also appeared when the reaction was carried out with nuclear extract of COS-1 cells transfected with a null expression vector as a negative control. Thus, four homeoproteins, Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β, were demonstrated to bind to GCE. Each of four homeoproteins, Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, and HNF1β, was co-transfected into COS-1 cells with the reporter construct containing –151 to +49 of the 5′-flanking region of the β3Gal-T5 promoter (Fig. 5). The reporter activity directed by Cdx1, Cdx2, HNF1α, or HNF1β increased 3-, 5-, or 11-fold, respectively, compared with that of the null expression plasmid. Thus, all homeoproteins were demonstrated to be capable of exerting the promoter activity for the β3Gal-T5 gene. β3Gal-T5 Was Up-regulated during Enterocytic Differentiation of Caco-2 Cells Correlating to Up-regulation of HNF1α and Cdx2—Changes of transcript levels for β3Gal-T5 and homeoproteins were examined during differentiation of Caco-2 cells, which have been used as an in vitro model for intestinal differentiation. As shown in Fig. 6, when the enterocytic differentiation of Caco-2 cells was induced by sodium butyrate, the transcript levels for β3Gal-T5, Cdx2 and HNF1α were elevated in 2 or 4 weeks after confluence, although the Cdx1 transcript was not detected and the HNF1β transcript level did not change. Whereas the transcript levels for Cdx2 and HNF1α peaked 2 weeks after confluence, the β3Gal-T5 transcripts gradually increased in 4 weeks after confluence. These results indicated that the β3Gal-T5 gene is transcriptionally regulated by Cdx2 and/or HNF1α during the differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Axial Gradient Expression of β3Gal-T5 and HNF1β in Colon and Significant Decrease of β3Gal-T5 and Cdx1 in Colon Cancer—To examine the alteration of β3Gal-T5 expression in cancer in vivo, we quantified the amounts of transcripts for β3Gal-T5 and four homeoproteins in 29 pairs of tissue samples from colon cancer and the surrounding normal mucosa using real time RT-PCR. The samples were divided into two groups based on the location of the lesion, i.e. “left colon,” descending to the sigmoid colon and rectum, and “right colon,” including the cecum, ascending, and transverse colon. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in sex, age, clinical stage, nodal metastasis, depth of invasion, and pathological features such as histological type or vascular/lymphatic invasion (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 7, the β3Gal-T5 transcript level of both groups decreased in cancer compared with normal mucosa with significance (p < 0.05), and interestingly, the β3Gal-T5 transcript level was significantly higher in the left colon than the right colon. Regarding the homeoproteins, the transcript levels for Cdx1 and HNF1β were also significantly lower in the left colon than the right colon. The amounts of Cdx1 and HNF1β transcript decreased significantly in cancer (p < 0.05). In contrast, those of Cdx2 and HNF1α presented no significant difference between the left colon and right colon. In some cases, the serum CA19-9 level was determined; however, no significant relation was found between the CA19-9 level and β3Gal-T5 transcript (data not shown). Detection of β3Gal-T5 in Normal, Metaplastic, and Cancerous Tissue by Immunohistochemical Analysis—We newly raised an anti-β3Gal-T5 monoclonal antibody and examined normal and cancerous tissues by immunohistochemistry. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blot analysis using the lysate of Namalwa cells transfected with each of the β3Gal-T1 to -T5 genes (Fig. 8). This antibody specifically reacted to the lysate of β3Gal-T5 Namalwa cells alone and not to the other cell lysates. It detected the specific band of β3Gal-T5, ∼42 kDa in size (Fig. 8). As shown in Fig. 9, perinuclear staining was observed in columnar cells of both small intestine (in Fig. 9, A and E) and colon (B and F). In colon, strong signals were observed especially at the top of villi rather than crypt, whereas the signal strength was almost equal through the top to the bottom of villi in small intestine. In colon cancer tissue, the signals were apparently weakened as compared with those of normal tissue (Fig. 9, C and G). However, in several cancer samples, which were immunohistochemically confirmed to express CA19-9 antigen, the signals for β3Gal-T5 were also weakened as compared with those of the corresponding normal tissue (data not shown). Whereas β3Gal-T5 was barely expressed in normal gastric foveolar epithelium and proper glands, strong signals were detected in absorptive cells of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach (Fig. 9, D and H).Fig. 9Expression of β3Gal-T5 protein in small intestine, colon, colon cancer, and stomach. The tissue expression of β3Gal-T5 protein in small intestine (A and E), colon (B and F), colon cancer (C and G), and stomach (D and H) was examined by immunohistochemistry using anti-human β3Gal-T5 monoclonal antibody and paraffin-embedded human tissue.

In this study, we analyzed the molecular mechanism for transcriptional regulation of the β3Gal-T5 gene. The members of two independent homeoprotein families, the Cdx and HNF1 families, were demonstrated to form a specific complex with the β3Gal-T5 promoter region and activate its gene transcription. This is the first report to demonstrate that homeoproteins are involved in the regulation of glycosyltransferases at the molecular level. In fact, our results indicated that four factors were differentially expressed depending on the system. Cdx1, Cdx2, and HNF1α were expressed in SW1116 cells and probably functioned as transcriptional factors. Cdx2 and HNF1α expression were correlated with β3Gal-T5 express"
https://openalex.org/W2030082326,"NADP+-dependent monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) from the nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii (AvIDH) is one of members of the β-decarboxylating dehydrogenase family and catalyzes the dehydration and decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield 2-oxoglutrate and CO2 in the Krebs cycle. We solved the crystal structure of the AvIDH in complex with cofactor NADP+ (AvIDH-NADP+ complex). The final refined model shows the closed form that has never been detected in any previously solved structures of β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases. The structure also reveals all of the residues that interact with NADP+. The structure-based sequence alignment reveals that these residues were not conserved in any other dimeric NADP+-dependent IDHs. Therefore the NADP+ specificity of the monomeric and dimeric IDHs was independently acquired through the evolutional process. The AvIDH was known to show an exceptionally high turnover rate. The structure of the AvIDH-NADP+ complex indicates that one loop, which is not present in the Escherichia coli IDHs, reliably stabilizes the conformation of the nicotinamide mononucleotide of the bound NADP+ by forming a few hydrogen bonds, and such interactions are considered to be important for the monomeric enzyme to initiate the hydride transfer reaction immediately. Finally, the structure of the AvIDH is compared with that of other dimeric NADP-IDHs. Several structural features demonstrate that the monomeric IDHs are structurally more related to the eukaryotic dimeric IDHs than to the bacterial dimeric IDHs.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1The abbreviations used are: IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; IPMDH, 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase; NADP-IDH, NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; NAD-IDH, NAD+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase; AvIDH, A. vinelandii IDH; EcIDH, E. coli IDH; PcIDH, porcine mitochondrial IDH; TtIPMDH, T. thermophilus IPMDH; BsIDH, B. subtilis IDH; PDB, Protein Data Bank; r.m.s.d., root-mean-squared deviation; w, water; ES, enzyme-substrate. is one of the enzymes of the Krebs cycle and catalyzes the metal ion- and NAD(P)+-dependent hydride transfer at C2 and then the metal ion-dependent decarboxylation at C3 of 2R,3S-isocitrate to generate 2-oxoglutarate and CO2 with a concomitant reduction of NAD(P)+ to NAD(P)H (1Chen R.D. Gadal P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1990; 28: 411-427Google Scholar). The product 2-oxoglutarate is a key material for the biosynthesis of glutamate by the action of glutamate dehydrogenase. IDHs are ubiquitously distributed in a wide variety of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Most prokaryotes possess only homodimeric NADP+-dependent IDHs (EC 1.1.1.42, NADP-IDHs), whereas eukaryotes possess both homodimeric NADP-IDHs and hetero-oligomeric NAD+-dependent IDHs (EC 1.1.1.41, NAD-IDHs). The hetero-oligomeric NAD-IDHs are known to be one of the allosterically regulated enzymes and participate in the supply of NADH in order to produce ATP by the respiratory chain reaction in the mitochondria (2Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7079-7086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ehrlich R.S. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5179-5187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition to IDHs, homodimeric NAD+-dependent isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (EC 1.1.1.85, NAD-IPMDHs) also catalyze the metal ion- and NAD+-dependent dehydration and decarboxylation of 2-isopropylmalate, a structurally similar compound to 2R,3S-isocitrate (4Miyazaki K.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structures of NADIPMDH from a few species of bacteria have already been determined (6Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y.

The structure analyses revealed that IDHs and IPMDHs were structurally homologous, and the similar structure at the catalytic site suggests that the catalytic mechanism must be identical. Therefore the IDHs and IPMDHs form the divergent protein family of the metal-dependent β-decarboxylating dehydrogenases (9Imada K. Inagaki K. Matsunami H. Kawaguchi H. Tanaka H. Tanaka N. Namba K. Structure. 1998; 6: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recently, tartrate dehydrogenase and homoisocitrate dehydrogenase have also been suggested to be members of this family (10Chen R. Jeong S.-S.

The EcIDH is an Mg2+- and NADP+-dependent dimeric enzyme consisting of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of 45 kDa. At present, >20 structures of the EcIDH have been solved including those for free enzymes, various complexes, and mutants. The catalytic site of the EcIDH was located at the intersubunit interface, and the isocitrate-Mg2+ was recognized with several residues derived from both subunits. Very recently, the structure of the porcine heart mitochondrial NADP-IDH (PcIDH) in complex with isocitrate-Mn2+ was reported previously (25Ceccarelli C. Grodsky N.B. Ariyaratne N. Colman R.F. Bahnson B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43454-43462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although the sequence identity between EcIDH and PcIDH is not high (16%), both structures are homologous and the structure-based sequence alignment showed that all of the residues for substrate and metal ion binding in both enzymes were completely conserved. In contrast to the homodimeric IDHs, the monomeric NADPIDHs with a molecular mass of 80-100 kDa were found in several taxonomically unrelated eubacteria. The nitrogen-fixing bacterium Azotobacter vinelandii is one of bacteria that possess the monomeric IDH. Interestingly, the cytoplasm of this organism contains the abundant monomeric IDH with a concentration of ∼1-2% of the total soluble protein (26Chung A.E. Franzen J.S. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 3175-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzyme showed unusually high activity as Barrera et al. (27Barrera C.R. Jurtshuk P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 220: 416-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported that the calculated turnover number of the enzyme was 56,000. These findings suggested that a large amount of NADPH was needed for the energy production and for providing the reductive environment to protect the abundant nitrogenase from oxidative damage. The Corynebacterium glutamicum is well known as a bacterium used for the production of approximately a million tons of l-glutamate every year (28Fudou R. Jojima Y. Seto A. Yamada K. Kimura E. Nakamatsu T. Hiraishi A. Yamanaka S. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2002; 52: 1127-1131PubMed Google Scholar). This organism also contains the highly active and highly specific monomeric IDH (29Chen R. Yang H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The psychrophilic marine bacterium Colwellia maris is a unique organism that possesses both homodimeric and monomeric IDHs. The gene encoding the monomeric enzyme was found to be a low temperature-inducible gene, and the enzyme exhibited the cold adaptation. Therefore the monomeric IDH was essential for the survival of this bacterium in low temperature environments (30Ishii A. Ochiai T. Imagawa S. Fukunaga N. Sasaki S. Minowa O. Mizuno Y. Shiokawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 102: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Ishii A. Suzuki M. Sahara T. Takada Y. Sasaki S. Fukunaga N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6873-6880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Suzuki M. Sahara T. Tsuruha J. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2138-2142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, recent genome projects have revealed several putative genes encoding the monomeric IDHs in extra bacteria, such as Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xylella fastidiosa. For the dimeric NADP- and hetero-oligomeric NAD-IDHs, the subunit assembly is an indispensable process because the catalytic sites are located at the intersubunit cleft and are formed with residues from both subunits. In contrast, the monomeric IDHs apparently catalyze the reaction identical to that of the dimeric IDH with a single polypeptide chain. We recently solved the crystal structure of the monomeric A. vinelandii IDH (AvIDH) in complex with isocitrate-Mn2+ (33Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1682-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 34Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Structure. 2002; 10: 1637-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Despite the absence of significant sequence similarities, the folding topology of the AvIDH was surprisingly related to that of the dimeric IDH. The pseudo 2-fold symmetry in the large domain (domain II) indicated that the AvIDH must have arisen through partial gene duplication. The duplicated structure comprised a portion corresponding to another subunit of the dimeric IDH, and such unique folding enabled a single polypeptide chain to form a catalytic site that is homologous to that of the dimeric IDH (34Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Structure. 2002; 10: 1637-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The structure of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2+ complex also revealed the evolutional relationship between the monomeric and dimeric IDHs. However, it is still not clear how the monomeric IDH recognizes the NADP+ and why the enzyme shows a particularly high turnover rate. The structure-based sequence alignment showed that the NADP+ binding residues of the dimeric EcIDH were not conserved in the AvIDH. Furthermore, the structure of the putative NADP+ binding site of the AvIDH was somehow different from that of the EcIDH structure (34Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Structure. 2002; 10: 1637-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that the manner of NADP+ recognition is different between monomeric and dimeric IDHs. Here we describe the crystal structure of the AvIDH in complex with NADP+. Together with the previous structure of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2+ complex, the mechanism of NADP+ recognition, the catalytic scheme with high activity, and the molecular evolution of the monomeric IDHs are discussed. Purification and Crystallization of the AvIDH—The nitrogen-fixing bacterium A. vinelandii (IAM1078) was cultured, and the monomeric IDH with high activity was directly isolated from the cell extract. The detailed procedures for the enzyme purification and the initial screenings of the crystallization condition were described previously (33Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1682-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To obtain the crystals of AvIDH in complex with isocitrate-Ca2+ and NADP+, the pseudo-Michaelis quaternary complex, we further performed an optimization of the crystallization condition by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature (291 K) using 24-well tissue culture plates (Linbro plates, ICN Biomedicals). The protein solution was prepared by adjusting 8 mg of protein/ml in 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The hanging drops were made by mixing 2.5 μl of protein solution with 1.5-4.5 μl of precipitating solution containing 100 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 24-28% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1-10 mm 2R,3S-isocitrate, 1-10 mm CaCl2, and 1-10 mm β-NADP+ and were equilibrated to a 500-μl precipitating solution. Although most crystals were needle-shaped and clustered, a few single crystals also grew within one month. As described later, the clear electron density showed that only the NADP+ bound to the enzyme. X-ray Diffraction Study—The x-ray diffraction experiment was performed on the beamline BL41XU (35Kawamoto M. Kawano Y. Kamiya N. Nucl. Instr. Meth. A. 2001; 467/468: 1375-1379Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at the third generation synchrotron radiation facility, SPring-8 (Harima, Japan). The flash-cooled crystals of the AvIDH complexed with NADP+ using the CryoLoop (Hampton Research) diffracted with extremely high mosaicity. Therefore the best single crystal was mounted in a glass capillary (Hampton Research) in advance and then the crystal was flash-cooled as the cryogenic nitrogen stream passed over the capillary. 2M. Yao, Y. Yasutake, and I. Tanaka, manuscript in preparation. The diffraction data were collected on a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (MAR Research) using a wavelength of 0.9 Å up to a resolution of 3.2 Å. The crystal was found to belong to the monoclinic system, the space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 113.5, b = 110.4, c = 133.7 Å and β = 90.2°. The diffraction data were integrated, scaled, and merged using the program MOSFLM (36Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 and ESF_EAMBC Newsletter on Protein Crystallography.

Open table in a new tab Phasing—The initial phase was obtained by the molecular replacement method using the programs AMoRe (38Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) and MOLREP (37Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), employing the previous structure of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2+ complex (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession code 1ITW) as a search model. The first run of the molecular replacement using a whole-length search model was a failure. To provide a more suitable search model, three fragments that protrude from the globular domain with high temperature factors were deleted (95 of 740 residues) from the model. We again performed the cross-rotation and translation search using this modified model, and the four correct locations of the molecule in the asymmetric unit were successfully determined. Model Refinement—The model refinement of the AvIDH·NAPD+ complex was performed with the program CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using reflections ranging from 10- to 3.2-Å resolution with the F/σ amplitude cutoff criteria of 2.4. To monitor the refinement, we set aside 10% of all reflections for the calculation of the free R-factor (R free) and the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints with weights of 500 kcal/Å2 were introduced for all of the atoms of protein molecules during all stages of model refinement. After the first cycle of rigid-body, positional, simulated annealing, and the individual B-factor refinement, the crystallographic R-factor (R cryst) and the R free were reduced from 36.5 and 39.2% to 33.3 and 37.5%, respectively. At this step, a SIGMAA-weighted mF o - DF c map calculated using this initial refined model showed that the large domain (domain II) was rotated to a certain degree and the location of the domain was corrected manually on the graphic program O (40Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaad M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The SIGMAA-weighted mF o - DF c map also allowed us to recognize that the NADP+ is bound to the enzyme. The model still included the incorrect parts, and we therefore corrected the model very carefully based on the SIGMAA-weighted mF o - DF c omit map calculated at the end of each refinement cycle. After the manual model corrections were mostly completed, four NADP+ molecules (one for each monomer) were added to the model. The topology and parameter files of the NADP+ molecule were obtained from the Hetero-compound Information Center of Uppsala on the Uppsala web site (41Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). After the iterative cycles of positional and individual B-factor refinement and manual model fitting, the R cryst and the R free were reduced to 27.5 and 30.3%, respectively. The water molecules were automatically located by peak-searching on the SIGMAA-weighted mF o - DF c map, and some of the molecules that occupied the irrelevant positions were deleted on the basis of real space correlation coefficient and/or maximum density level using the procedure in the program CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Finally, the R cryst and R free were converged to 26.0 and 29.7%, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the final refined model was analyzed with the program PROCHECK (42Laskowski R.A. Mac Arthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Structure Description—The structure of the AvIDH in complex with NADP+ was solved by the molecular replacement method, and the model refinement was performed against 3.2-Å resolution. The AvIDH is an 80-kDa monomeric enzyme consisting of 741 amino acid residues, and the asymmetric unit contains four monomers with a Matthews' coefficient V M value of 2.61 Å3 Da-1 (43Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar). The SIGMAA-weighted mF o - DF c omit map showed unambiguously that the NADP+ was bound to the enzyme, whereas the isocitrate and Ca2+, which we added to the mother liquor in expectation of their binding to the enzyme, were not found at the catalytic site. The final refined model was composed of four polypeptide chains (each contained residues 3-740), four NADP+ molecules at the active sites, and 324 oxygen atoms of water molecules with the crystallographic R-factor and the R free factor of 26.0 and 29.7%, respectively. The structure of the AvIDH-NADP+ complex was comprised of 27 α-helices and 18 β-strands with a folding topology similar to the structure of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2+ complex that we reported recently (Fig. 1) (34Yasutake Y.

The structure of the AvIDH was divided into two distinct domains: a small domain (domain I) and a large domain (domain II). Domain I was comprised of five β-strands and 14 α-helices and includes both N- and C-terminal segments. Domain II was comprised of 16 β-strands and 13 α-helices and was formed by two topologically identical motifs, which were tightly intertwined and related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry. This interaction between two motifs structurally corresponds to the intensive and expansive intersubunit interface in the structure of the dimeric IDH (34Yasutake Y. Watanabe S. Yao M. Takada Y. Fukunaga N. Tanaka I. Structure. 2002; 10: 1637-1648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Domain Movement—In the structure of the AvIDH-NADP+ complex, a large conformational change was found to occur. By comparison with the previous structure of the AvIDH-isocitrate-Mn2+ complex, the two domains of the AvIDH were relatively rotated by an angle of 9° and, accordingly, the present structure showed a more closed conformation than the previous structure of the isocitrate-Mn2+ complex (Fig. 2). This closed structure seemed to be an inactive form, because the structure did not provide enough space for substrate-metal ion binding (see “Inhibition by the Ca2+”). Within each domain, the main chains can be very well superimposed. This rigid-body movement is an example of the typical hinge motions that occur in several proteins with multidomain structures. Since both the N- and C-terminal segments were in domain I, the hinges must be located at the incoming and outgoing chain in the vicinity of the connecting region between the two domains. The Ramachandran analysis indicated that the greater than 30° rotations of the [phis]- and/or ψ-angles between the two structures occurred in the residues 137-138, 142-144, and 560-565. The former two regions lie at the loop between α6 and β6, and the latter lies at the loop between α19 and β5. Both of these loops are located exactly at the connecting region between the two domains. One question then arises as to why the enzyme formed the closed structure. The rigid-body movement does not spawn additional hydrogen bonds, ion pairs, or hydrophobic interactions between the two domains. This finding suggests that such conformational changes must occur easily if the small free energy barrier is surmounted. Therefore the closed structure might have been formed in the process of the crystallization. It is likely that the crystal lattice formation has forced the flexible molecule into the closed structure. Actually, the condition of the molecular contacts in the crystal lattice was quite different between the previous open form and the present closed form. Similar domain movement was also reported previously in the structure of the EcIDH (19Hurley J.H. Chen R. Dean A.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5670-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and IPMDH from Thermus thermophilus (TtIPMDH) (6Imada K. Sato M. Tanaka N. Katsube Y. Matsuura Y. Oshima T. J. Mol.

In the case of the EcIDH, the domain rotation opened up the active site cleft and further exposed the residue Ser113 to the solvent (20Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E. Cherbavaz D.B. LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13890-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This open conformation thus appeared to be a key structure for the regulatory phosphorylation of Ser113 catalyzed by the bifunctional IDH kinase/phosphatase (20Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E.

Protein affinity pull-down assays using recombinant proteins showed that IE62 and Sp1 interact in the absence of any other viral and cellular proteins.

The region identified in Sp1 is involved in DNA-binding, synergistic Sp1 activation, and Sp1 interaction with cellular transcription factors. The interacting region identified in IE62 overlaps with or borders on sites involved in interactions with the VZV IE4 protein and the cellular factors TBP and TFIIB.

The VZV genome is a linear double-stranded DNA molecule, which encodes approximately seventy proteins (1Davison A.J. Scott J.E. J. Gen Virol. 1986; 67: 2237-2242Google Scholar). The entire complement of VZV genes is believed to be expressed during lytic infection in three broad kinetic classes, immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L). Transcription of VZV genes is performed by the host cell RNA polymerase II, as is the case with all other herpes viruses. Efficient expression of the VZV genome is driven by a small group of VZV gene products including those encoded by open reading frames (ORFs) 62, 4, 61, 63, and 10 (2Cohen J.I. Straus S.E. Fields B.N.

The major viral transactivator is the product of ORF 62 and its complement, ORF 71, which lie within the inverted repeats bracketing the Us region of VZV DNA. This protein is commonly designated IE62 since it is synthesized in the immediate early phase of lytic VZV gene expression. IE62 contains a potent N-terminal acidic transactivation domain and is capable of activating the expression of all three kinetic classes of VZV genes (12Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Zadeghi-Zadeh M. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J.

While IE62 is involved in transactivation of VZV promoters, careful analysis of a limited number of individual viral promoters has shown that cellular transcription factors acting at sites upstream of the coding regions of the viral genes are also involved in the mechanism of IE62 activation. These proteins include the ubiquitous, sequence specific cellular factor Sp1. Sp1 is the protoype of a family of closely related factors which bind to GC-rich elements including the GC-box (GGGCGG or GGGCGGG) and the related GT/CACCC-box. Sp1 contains five distinct domains, four of which (A, B, C, and D) are involved in various aspects of transcriptional activation as well as a DNA binding region containing three zinc fingers (reviewed in Refs. 15Philipsen S.

Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Sp1 interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TPB) and the TBP-associated factor TAF 110/130 via the glutamine rich A and B domains (18Gill G. Pascal E. Treng Z.H. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Recent studies from this and other laboratories have shown that Sp1 binding sites are important for the regulation of expression of VZV promoters (42Rahaus M. Wolff M.H. Virus Res. 2000; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 43Ito H. Sommer M.H. Zerboni L. He H. Boucaud D. Hay J Ruyechan W. Arvin A.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the work described here we have explored the involvement of Sp1 in IE62-mediated activation of the viral glycoprotein I (gI) promoter using reporter gene assays and site-specific mutations and show that the presence of an Sp1 site is important for this activation. The presence of an Sp1-IE62 complex in infected cell extracts has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and the regions of these two proteins, which interact have been mapped by protein affinity pull-down assays. Finally, we present data, which indicate that Sp1 is involved in recruiting IE62 to the gI promoter and that the presence of IE62 increases the levels of Sp1 and TBP binding to the promoter. Cell Lines and Viruses—A3.01 cells, a CD4+ continuous human T cell line and MeWo cells, a continuous melanoma cell line, were propagated and maintained as described by Boucaud et al. (44Boucaud D. Yoshitake H. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 34-38Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Virus strain MSP-VZV was propagated, maintained as frozen stocks, and used to infect MeWo cell monolayers as described by Sommer et al. (45Sommer M.H. Zagha E. Serrano O.K. Ku C.C. Zerboni A. Santos R. Spengler M. Lynch J. Grose C. Riuyechan W. Hay J. Arvin A.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8225-8239Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Plasmids—The gI3.4CAT and gI3CAT reporter plasmids were generated as described by Kantakamalakul et al. (46Kantakamalakul W. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Neurology. 1995; 45: S28-S29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gI3.4CAT plasmid contains a region of the gI promoter up to and including the activating upstream sequence (AUS) and TATA element The gI3CAT plasmid contains the TATA element but not the upstream AUS sequence (47He H. Boucaud D. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. Arch. Virol. 2001; 17: 57-70Google Scholar). The Sp1 site mutation was introduced into the gI3.4CAT reporter plasmid by PCR mutagenesis using the following primers: Sp1m(+): GTGTGTGTAAGCTTAGATCTACAGAGTCACGAACCATTACAAGCTTAAGGTTCC and HindIII BglII AUS-Sp1m HindIII Sp1m(-): GGAACCTTAAGCTTGTAATGGTTCGTGACTCTGT AGATCT AAGCTTACACACAC; HindIII AUS-Sp1m BglII HindIII. The HindIII site was used as the cloning site, and the BglII site was used as the selection marker. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Correct insertion of the mutated sequences was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Roswell Park Sequencing Facility (Buffalo, NY). The reporter plasmid containing the Sp1 site mutation was designated Sp1m. The effector plasmid pCMV62, which expresses the IE62 protein has been previously described (12Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5298-5304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-Sp1 constructs, originally generated in Dr. Jonathan Horowitz's laboratory (48Murata Y. Kim H.G. Rogers K.T. Udvadia A.J. Horowitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20674-20681Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. Adrian Black (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). These plasmids express full-length Sp1 (amino acids 1–778), a C-terminal truncation (amino acids 1–612), or an N-terminal truncation (amino acids 612–778). Plasmids expressing GST-IE62 C-terminal truncations were those generated by Spengler et al. (49Spengler M.L. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 2000; 272: 375-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These plasmids: pGEX-IE62 (1–406), pGEX-IE62 (1–299), pGEX-IE62 (1–226), pGEX-IE62 (1–161), and pGEX-IE62 (1–43) encode the N-terminal 1–406, 1–299, 1–226, 1–161, and 1–43 amino acids of the VZV IE62 protein, respectively. Antibodies—The anti-IE62 monoclonal (H6) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies used in these studies have been previously described (49Spengler M.L. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 2000; 272: 375-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monclonal antibodies directed against the p32 subunit of human replication protein A (RPA) were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (San Diego, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the p32 subunit of RPA were obtained from Dr. Thomas Melendy (University at Buffalo). Goat and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against Sp1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biologicals (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—Transfection of A3.01 cells by electroporation with 10 μg of a specific CAT reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pCMV62 effector plasmid was performed as described by Boucaud et al. (44Boucaud D. Yoshitake H. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 178: 34-38Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48-h post-transfection and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as previously described (11Perera L.P. Kaushal S. Kinchington P.R. Mosca J.D. Hayward G.S. Straus S.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2468-2477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Perera L.P. Mosca J.D. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J.

The extent of acetylation was quantified by using a Bio-Rad Phosphoimager and Molecular Imaging Software. For transfection experiments aimed at assessing the effect of the presence of IE62 on Sp1 and TBP binding, 175 cm2 flasks containing MeWo cell monolayers at 80% confluency were transfected with 30 μg of pCMV62 plasmid using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instruction. The transfected cells were harvested 48-h post-transfection, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. Preparation of Nuclear and Whole Cell Extracts—Pelleted cells were washed once with 30 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Packed cells were resuspended in one packed cell volume of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by 10 rapid passages through a 25-gauge hypodermic syringe and the homogenate was sedimented briefly at 12,000 × g. The crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in two-thirds of one packed cell volume (determined at the time of cell harvest) of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) followed by incubation on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear debris was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) for 2 h. The dialyzed extract was then quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Magnetic Bead Recruitment Assays—Magnetic bead recruitment assays were performed essentially as described by Lynch et al. (50Lynch J.M. Kenyon T.K. Grose C. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. Virology. 2002; 302: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A 128-bp biotinylated DNA fragment containing the AUS and TATA elements and 68 bp of downstream sequence was generated from the gI3.4CAT and Sp1m reporter plasmids using biotinylated primers (IDT, Coralville, IA). A 108-bp biotinylated fragment lacking the AUS sequence was derived from the gI3CAT reporter plasmid. 10 pmol of biotinylated DNA in 100 μl of 1× Binding and Washing (B&W) buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 m NaCl) were added to 50 μl of M-280 streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) which had been prewashed twice with 100 μlof2× B&W buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m NaCl). The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were collected using a magnetic particle concentrator (Dynal), washed twice with 200 μl of 1× B&W buffer, and then washed twice with 200 μl of TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl). Next either 250 μg of VZV-infected MeWo nuclear extract or 250 μg of uninfected MeWo or T cell nuclear extract or 250 μg of pCMV62-transfected MeWo cell nuclear extract was incubated with the beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The reactions were resuspended 3× during the 1 h incubation. Next the beads were washed 3× with 400 μl of TEN buffer. To elute specifically bound proteins the beads were incubated with 10 μl of 2× B&W buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The eluted fractions were boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer for 10 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation of IE62 and Sp1—Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was blocked with a 4% milk/PBS solution for 1 h at 4 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation was initiated by conjugating 50 μg of antibody to 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h. The antibodies used were monoclonal anti-IE62 antibody H6 and goat polyclonal anti-SP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The antibody-conjugated beads were washed with three 500-μl aliquots of 1× PBS/1% Tween 80. The beads were then incubated with MeWo cell nuclear extract (500 μg of protein) for 3 h at 4 °C. Following incubation the reaction mixtures were centrifuged and the beads washed three times with PBS/1% Tween 80. The beads were then resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. The samples were analyzed on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The antibodies used for the Western blot were rabbit polyclonal anti-SP1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-IE62 antibody generated in our laboratory. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the RPA32 subunit of RPA and polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against RPA32, were used in control experiments for either immunoprecipitation or immunoblot detection to determine the specificity of the IE62-Sp1 interaction. Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in conjunction with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Quantification of the relative amounts of IE62 and Sp1 co-immunoprecipitated was performed by densitometry using a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) model GS-700 imaging densitometer. Experimental signals were normalized to signals obtained from loading controls or immunoblots of serial dilutions of recombinant IE62 or nuclear extracts from infected cells. Protein Affinity Pull-down Assays—The VZV IE62 protein was expressed in recombinant baculovirus and purified from infected cell cultures as previously described (49Spengler M.L. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 2000; 272: 375-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the protein affinity pull-down experiments, GST-Sp1 fusions, GST-IE62 fusions and GST were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α following induction with IPTG and crude lysates were prepared and clarified as previously described (49Spengler M.L. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 2000; 272: 375-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 50Lynch J.M. Kenyon T.K. Grose C. Hay J. Ruyechan W.T. Virology. 2002; 302: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 200 μl aliquots of the bacterial lysates were then added to 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads which were washed twice with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBST). In capture assays using GST-IE62 fusions 1–1.5 mg protein present in nuclear extracts in a final volume of 350 μl was added to the beads. In capture assays using GST-Sp1 fusions, a mixture of 40 μg of recombinant IE62 and 200 μg BSA in 350 μl of PBST was added to the beads. The resulting slurries were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then collected by low speed centrifugation and washed three times with 500 μl of PBST. Bound proteins were released by addition of 75 μlof2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by boiling. IE62 was visualized by separation of 20-μl aliquots of these samples on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblottting with polyclonal rabbit anti-IE62 antibody (49Spengler M.L. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Virology. 2000; 272: 375-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) in conjunction with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). Sp1 Is Involved in Regulation of the VZV Glycoprotein I Promoter—We have previously identified a 20-base pair element within the VZV gI promoter designated the activating upstream sequence (AUS). This sequence, along with an atypical TATA element (ATAAAA) located 12-base pairs downstream of the AUS are both required for IE62-mediated activation (46Kantakamalakul W. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. Neurology. 1995; 45: S28-S29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ling P. Kinchington P.R. Ruyechan W.T. Hay J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3690-3698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and represent the minimal IE62-responsive gI promoter designated gI3.4. The AUS contains an Sp1 binding site (ACGCCC), which is identical to one of the two Sp1 sites found upstream of the VZV gE promoter (42Rahaus M. Wolff M.H. Virus Res. 2000; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This sequence partially overlaps with a predicted atypical binding site for the transcription factor USF and a potential AP-1 binding site. A two base pair mutation was generated in the non-overlapping region of the Sp1 site (Fig. 1A) and the ability of this mutant promoter element (Sp1m) to support IE62-mediated expression of a CAT reporter gene was determined relative to the wild-type promoter and a promoter lacking the entire AUS sequence (gI3). The results are presented in Fig. 1B and show that the Sp1 mutation resulted in expression of CAT activity at levels seen with the AUS-deleted promoter, which is non-responsive to IE62. Magnetic bead recruitment assays were next performed in order to determine if Sp1 does, in fact, bind to this promoter element and if the introduced mutation alters that binding. In these experiments, oligonucleotides derived from the gI3.4 promoter, Sp1m promoter, and gI3 promoter containing wild-type and mutant Sp1 sites within the AUS or lacking the entire AUS sequence, respectively, were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. All three oligonucleotides contained the gI promoter TATA element plus 43 nucleotides downstream of the TATA element. The oligonucleotide-bound beads were incubated with MeWo cell nuclear extracts derived from cells transfected with a plasmid expressing the IE62 protein. Bound proteins were eluted with 2 m NaCl separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Sp1 antibody. The data are presented in Fig. 1C and show that the mutation within the Sp1 site very significantly decreased the binding of Sp1 as compared with the level seen with the wild-type sequence (lanes 1 and 2). Experiments using the promoter element lacking the entire AUS sequence but retaining the TATA box and downstream sequences gave essentially identical results as the mutant Sp1 site (lane 3). Assays performed using uninfected MeWo cell and T cell extracts also showed binding only to the wild-type sequence (data not shown). Thus the results presented above indicate that, in the context of this promoter, Sp1 plays a major role in the mechanism of IE62 activation and this role correlates with the binding of Sp1 to a specific site within the promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation of Sp1 and IE62—Based on the fact that mutation of the Sp1 site significantly decreased the level of Sp1 bound to the gI promoter element and also reduced IE62-mediated transactivation of this promoter, we investigated the possibility of an interaction between these two proteins in infected cells. In the first series of experiments a polyclonal goat-anti-Sp1 antibody was used in protein G-enhanced immunoprecipitation from VZV-infected MeWo cell nuclear extracts. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed for the presence of Sp1 and IE62 by immunoblot. The results are presented in Fig. 2A and show that the anti-Sp1 antibody precipitated IE62 as well as Sp1. In these experiments, 44% of the total Sp1 was precipitated and 2.4% of the total IE62 was co-precipitated. The converse experiment was also performed using the monoclonal H6 anti-IE62 antibody. The results are presented in Fig. 2B and show that the anti-IE62 monoclonal antibody precipitated both IE62 and Sp1. In these experiments, 21.7% of the total IE62 was precipitated and 4.9% of the total Sp1 was co-precipitated. Two additional repetitions of the immunoprecipitations yielded similar levels of co-precipitation. These results indicate that a fraction of Sp1 and IE62 in VZV-infected cells is present in a protein complex but do not eliminate the possibility that one or more additional proteins or DNA within such a complex act as a bridge between Sp1 and IE62. Control experiments showed that the antibodies used did not co-precipitate the ubiquitous and abundant eukaryotic single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA which is involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination and has been shown to bind to specific cellular promoter regions (52Wold M.S. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Mapping of Sp1 and IE62 Interaction Domains—Protein affinity pull-down assays were performed using recombinant Sp1 and IE62 constructs in order to address the question of a direct physical interaction between these proteins. In a preliminary study, we have recently shown that recombinant IE62 can interact with a GST fusion protein containing full length Sp1 (53Ruyechan W.T. Peng H. He H. Hay J. J. Med Virol. 2003; 70: S90-S94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, GST fusion proteins containing full-length Sp1 (amino acids 1–778), a C-terminal deletion containing the glutamine rich A and B activation domains and domain C (amino acids 1–612) and the complementary N-terminal deletion containing the DNA-binding domain and activation domain D (amino acids 612–778) were expressed and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. Purified recombinant IE62 derived from baculovirus was then added to the Sp1-GST bound beads. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling and the presence of IE62 in the eluates was detected by immunoblotting. The results are presented in Fig. 3A and show that recombinant IE62 bound to the full-length Sp1-GST fusion protein and to the GST fusion protein containing amino acids 612–778 of Sp1. In contrast, IE62 bound at only trace levels to the C-terminal Sp1 truncation (a"

To identify the discontinuous epitope of this mAb, we used phage display, mutant analysis, and peptide modeling. All 82D6A3-binding phages displayed peptides containing the consensus sequence SPWR that could be aligned with P981W982 in the VWF A3-domain. Next, the binding of mAb 82D6A3 to 27 Ala mutants with mutations in the A3-domain of VWF revealed that amino acids Arg963, Pro981, Asp1009, Arg1016, Ser1020, Met1022, and His1023 are part of the epitope of mAb 82D6A3. Inspection of residues Ser1020, Arg1016, Pro981, and Trp982 in the three-dimensional structure of the A3-domain demonstrated that these residues are close together in space, pointing out that the structure of the SPWR consensus sequence might mimic this discontinuous epitope. Modeling of a cyclic 6-mer peptide containing the consensus sequence and superposition of its three-dimensional structure onto the VWF A3-domain demonstrated that the Ser and Arg in the peptide matched the Ser1020 and Arg1016 in the A3-domain. The Pro residue of the peptide served as a spacer, and the side chain of the Trp pointed in the direction of Trp982. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first report where a modeled peptide containing a consensus sequence could be fitted onto the three-dimensional structure of the antigen, indicating that it might adopt the conformation of the discontinuous epitope."

The ferryl species is maximally formed with one equivalent of H2O2, and the maximum yields of the dimer (28%) and trimer (17%) with 1 or 2 eq. Co-incubation of the SwMb Y151F mutant with native apoSwMb and H2O2 produced dimeric products, which requires radical transfer from the nondimerizing Y151F mutant to apoSwMb. Autoreduction of ferryl SwMb to the ferric state is biphasic with t = 3.4 and 25.9 min. An intramolecular autoreduction process is implicated at low protein concentrations, but oligomerization decreases the lifetime of the ferryl species at high protein concentrations. A fraction of the protein remained monomeric. This dimerization-resistant protein was in the ferryl state, but after autoreduction it underwent normal dimerization with H2O2. Proteolytic digestion established the presence of both dityrosine and isodityrosine cross-links in the oligomeric proteins, with the isodityrosine links primarily forged by Tyr151-Tyr151 coupling. The tyrosine content decreased by 47% in the dimer and 14% in the recovered monomer, but the yields of isodityrosine and dityrosine in the dimer were only 15.2 and 6.8% of the original tyrosine content. Approximately 23% of the lost tyrosines therefore have an alternative but unknown fate. The results clearly demonstrate the concurrence of intra- and intermolecular electron transfer processes involving Mb protein radicals. Intermolecular electron transfers that generate protein radicals on bystander proteins are likely to propagate the cellular damage initiated by the reaction of metalloproteins with H2O2.

Protein radical formation has also been extensively studied in the reactions of Mb and hemoglobin with peroxides, both as readily accessible models for the study of such reactions and because these hemoproteins appear to initiate and propagate oxidative damage in various physiological situations (12King N.K.

Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein radicals are commonly generated by the reaction of metal centers with peroxides, but they can also arise by reaction of the proteins with agents such as the hydroxyl radical (19Fancy D. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Garrison W.M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 381-398Crossref Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Protein radicals, once generated, can participate in catalytic processes or can lead to cross-linking of amino acid residues, covalent bonding of prosthetic groups, formation of protein peroxides, and cleavage of the protein backbone (21Davies M.J. Fu S. Wang H. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Even the last reactions can be physiologically important, as in the formation of a tyrosine-cross-linked protective shell by sea urchin ovoperoxidase (22Foerder C.A. Shapiro B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4214-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), but they are more commonly associated with deleterious biological processes (23Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because of their importance, the formation, localization, delocalization, and propagation of protein free radicals are of intense current interest. The reactions of metMb 1The abbreviations used are: metMb, metmyoglobin; SwMb, sperm whale metmyoglobin; Mb, myoglobin; LPO, lactoperoxidase; heme, iron protoporphyrin IX regardless of the oxidation and ligation states; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. with H2O2 have provided a useful model for investigation of the general properties of protein radicals. The formation of an EPR-detectable protein radical in the reactions of both SwMb and equine metMb with H2O2 is now well established (17Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Degray J.A. Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2359-2362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Formation of these protein radicals leads to oligomerization of the metMb monomers. Cross-linking of sperm whale metMb has been found by site-specific mutagenesis in conjunction with protein digestion, peptide sequencing, mass spectrometry, and EPR spectroscopy to involve the formation of Tyr103 and Tyr151 cross-links (15Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Based on the observation of a characteristic fluorescence, these cross-links have been attributed to the formation of dityrosine bonds. Tyr146, the third and last tyrosine in SwMb, forms a radical but does not participate in chemical reactions (18Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence exists for additional Mb protein radicals centered on Trp14 (18Rao S. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Soc. 1996; 118: 12236-12237Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A ferryl (FeIV=O) species is formed in parallel with formation of the protein radicals in the reaction of metMb with H2O2. Although not detected, the reaction of metMb with H2O2 may first produce a transient Compound I-like intermediate in which the ferryl species is associated with a porphyrin rather than protein radical (27Matsui T. Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9952-9957Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Electron transfer from the protein to the porphyrin radical cation would then produce the observed protein radical. The protein residue that provides the electron that quenches the porphyrin radical cation has not been unambiguously identified, but the unpaired electron density readily translocates to residues such as Tyr151 and Trp14 that are some distance away from the heme group. The Tyr151 radical is formed even when the Tyr146 and Tyr103 residues, which are closer to the heme, have been mutated to phenylalanines. A tyrosine-linked pathway for translocation of the protein radical thus does not appear to be required. Lactoperoxidase (LPO) reacts with H2O2 to form a Compound I species with an FeIV=O ferryl species and a porphyrin radical cation (29Thomas E.L. Pruitt K.M. Tenovuo J.O. The Lactoperoxidase System: Chemistry and Biological Significance. Marcel Dekker, New York1985: 31-54Google Scholar). As proposed for Mb, this Compound I intermediate decays to a second “Compound I” species that retains the FeIV=O but now has a protein rather than porphyrin radical (30Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999: 20Google Scholar, 31Courtin F. Michot J.-L. Virion A. Pommier J. Deme D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 121: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Formation of this second Compound I structure results in dimerization of LPO via a dityrosine cross-link involving Tyr289 (32Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, unpaired electron density is shown by spin trapping and EPR studies to reside at sites in addition to Tyr289 (32Lardinois O.M. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35441-35448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the protein radicals formed in the LPO catalytic cycle have a biological function other than their probable involvement in autocatalytic covalent attachment of the prosthetic heme group to the protein (33Colas C. Kuo J.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7191-7200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but we recently provided evidence that the LPO radical can be transferred to metMb (34Lardinois O.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23186-23191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined in greater detail the protein radicals formed in the reaction of SwMb with H2O2 in order to quantitatively evaluate their fate and to determine the extent to which the protein radical undergoes intra- and intermolecular transfer from one site to another. The translocation of a radical within a protein and within proteins in a common environment is of considerable interest, since it enables the propagation of unpaired electron density from the site of its formation in a metalloprotein to sites that may differ in properties, reactivity, and cellular location. Materials—SwMb type II acquired from Sigma was used without further purification (this product is no longer commercially available). A stock solution was prepared daily. In some experiments, Mb solutions were purified before use by passage through a Superdex 75 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) as described below; identical results were obtained with both the commercial and purified materials. The SwMb concentration was determined from the Soret maximum at 409 nm (ϵmetMb,409 = 157 mm-1 cm-1) (35Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Elsevier, New York1971: 44Google Scholar), whereas that of apoMb was determined from the aromatic amino acid band at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 16 mm-1 cm-1) (36Goto Y. Calciano L.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). All aqueous solutions were prepared using water passed through a Milli Q system (Millipore Corp.) equipped with a 0.2-μm pore size filter. Diluted H2O2 solutions, obtained from a 30% solution (Sigma), were used within 1 h of preparation. The H2O2 concentration was confirmed by absorbance measurements at 240 nm (ϵH2O2,240 = 39.4m-1 cm-1) (37Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Leucine aminopeptidase (type IV-S, from porcine kidney microsomes), carboxypeptidase Y (from bakers' yeast), and endopeptidase (protease type X, from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus rokko) were from Sigma. Prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD-10) gel filtration cartridges were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma or Roche Applied Science. Analytical Methods—Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 1E UV-visible spectrometer (Varian, Victoria, Australia). Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra were measured with a Perkin Elmer Life Sciences LS 50 B fluorimeter (Beaconsfield, UK). The kinetic data for the reduction of ferryl Mb were obtained using a Hewlett Packard 8452A UV-visible diode array spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA). High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out on a Hewlett Packard 1090 liquid chromatography system. SDS-PAGE was done on an Amersham Biosciences Phast System. Gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies were performed on a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. Preparation and Expression of Site-directed Mutants—The mutant SwMb proteins were expressed, purified, and oxidized to the met form as described previously (17Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lardinois O.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23186-23191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The far UV circular dichroism spectra of wild-type and mutant SwMb proteins at pH 6.8 were fully superimposable (data not shown). In all mutants examined, the observed UV-visible spectra were nearly identical to those of the native protein, indicating that changes to the structure in the vicinity of the heme iron were minimal (data not shown). Preparation of ApoMb—ApoMb was prepared by 2-butanone extraction of acidified solutions of SwMb (16Catalano C.E. Choe Y.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10534-10541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A solution of 50 mg of SwMb in 1500 μl of water cooled to 4 °C was acidified to pH 2.5 by the addition of concentrated HCl. The resulting mixture was extracted with 4 volumes of cold 2-butanone. The organic layer containing the extracted heme was discarded. The aqueous solution was passed over a PD-10 column previously equilibrated and eluted with water. The colored band was collected and loaded directly on a (2.6 × 100 cm) Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated and run at 0.50 ml/min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The apoprotein eluted as a single symmetric peak that was collected and stored at 4 °C for subsequent analysis. The residual heme content was lower than 1% as evaluated by the ratio of the absorbances at 280 and 408 nm. Reconstitution of ApoMb with Protoheme—A 1-mg sample of hemin (Aldrich) was dissolved in 1 ml of 0.01 NaOH. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 with 0.1 m HCl, and the hemin was then passed through a 0.2-μm filter to remove the precipitate. 1.5–2 eq of dissolved hemin was added to 3.5 μm apoMb in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and the mixture was left to equilibrate at room temperature for 2 h. Excess hemin was removed by passage through a PD-10 column previously equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The colored band of hemin-reconstituted SwMb was collected and stored at 4 °C for subsequent analysis. Preparation of Dityrosine and Isodityrosine Standards—Dityrosine and isodityrosine were prepared using a combination of published procedures (38Fry S.C. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 388-397Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A 4.0-g sample of l-tyrosine was dissolved in 100 ml of 8.5 m NH4OH, and 10 ml of 0.75 m K3Fe(CN)6 was added with stirring. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 ml of isopropyl alcohol, and the mixture was left standing overnight. Centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min yielded a clear yellowish brown supernatant. The supernatant was applied on a DEAE-cellulose (Sigma) column (2.5 × 25 cm) previously equilibrated with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol plus 8.5 m NH4OH (4:1, ν), and the column was washed with 1 liter of the same solvent mixture. The column was then washed and eluted with 2 m NH4OH at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions of 10 ml were collected and evaluated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. Samples of the major peak were pooled and concentrated to 50 ml in a rotary evaporator under vacuum before adjusting the pH to 8.0 with concentrated NaOH. The resulting solution was then subjected to FPLC on an Amersham Biosciences Mono Q HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with 10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0. Amino acids were eluted from the anion exchange column with a 26-ml linear gradient of 0–150 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Dityrosine and isodityrosine eluted from the anion exchange column in the void volume and at 100 mm NaCl, respectively. The collected peaks were acidified to pH 2.0 by adding concentrated HCl and were then desalted using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters) previously equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The cartridges were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/acetonitrile (6:4, ν). Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were removed under vacuum using a SpeedVac concentrator. The resulting solution was then subjected to FPLC on an Amersham Biosciences Mono S HR 5/5 column previously equilibrated with 10 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0. Amino acids were eluted from the cation exchange column with an 80-ml linear gradient of 0–80 mm NaCl in 10 mm acetic acid, pH 3.0, at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Dityrosine and isodityrosine eluted from the cation exchange column at 40 and 45 mm NaCl, respectively. The two peaks were desalted as above. After one passage through the Mono Q and the Mono S columns, the oxidation products were apparently homogeneous as assessed by reverse phase HPLC. Each compound eluted as a single symmetrical peak. Determination of the Extinction Coefficient of Tyrosine Radical Addition Products—The extinction coefficients of tyrosine radical addition products were determined using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1-sulfonic acid for free amino group quantification (40Satake K. Okuyama T. Ohashi M. Shinoda T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1960; 47: 654-660Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar) with calibration on a tyrosine solution. The values obtained by this approach for dityrosine and isodityrosine in 0.1 m NaOH were 8600 m-1 cm-1 at 316 nm and 5961 m-1 cm-1 at 296 nm, respectively. Titration of SwMb with H 2 O 2 —Titration experiments were carried out at 4 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Suitable volumes of H2O2 solution were added stepwise to a freshly prepared SwMb solution (250 μm), and the spectrum was recorded <6 s after the addition of H2O2. After each addition of H2O2, a 64-μl aliquot of the incubation mixture was removed and rapidly mixed with 336 μl of a quenching solution composed of 19 mm sodium ascorbate and 84 units of catalase in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Control experiments (not shown) showed that under these conditions, the ferryl Mb was completely converted to metMb within 1 min. The resulting solutions were stored at 4 °C until they were subjected to FPLC on a gel filtration column as described below to check the progress of the reaction and the nature of cross-linked products. Correlation of the Autoreduction of Ferryl Mb to MetMb with Oligomerization Yields—Reactions were conducted in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 25 °C using 250 μm SwMb stock solutions. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.4 eq of H2O2. After a 10-s incubation, the excess H2O2 was removed by adding catalase (26 units). At various times, a scan was taken, and a 64-μl aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and rapidly mixed with the ascorbate-catalase solution as above. The resulting solutions were analyzed by FPLC on a gel filtration column to check the progress of the reaction as described below. Pseudo-first-order rate constants for the reaction were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis (the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm). Dependence of the Oligomerization Yield on the [Mb]/[H 2 O 2 ] Ratio— SwMb stock solutions (40–2560 μm) were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and incubated at 25 °C. Suitable volumes of H2O2 solution were added to SwMb to give the desired H2O2/SwMb molar ratio. After a 5-min incubation, the excess H2O2 was removed by adding catalase (52 units). The resulting solutions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h and allowed to stand at 4 °C until subjected to FPLC on a gel filtration column as described below. SDS-PAGE of Protein Samples—Cross-linking experiments were similarly performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, at 25 °C for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were allowed to stand in SDS for 10 min and heated at 100 °C for 2 min prior to loading onto the gels, which were developed and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Separation and Quantification of SwMb Cross-linking Products by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Samples were diluted to a final concentration of 40 μm in heme and subjected to FPLC on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column with detection at 280 nm. The column was equilibrated and run at 0.50 ml/min in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. The yield of cross-linked protein was estimated by comparing the area of earlier eluting peaks (high molecular mass) with that of the peak area obtained for metMb before the addition of H2O2. Control experiments (not shown) established that the total area of the peaks at 280 nm remained unaffected by the polymerization. Since the extinction coefficient of the native form and the degree of polymerization of the cross-linked products were known, it was possible to determine the molar concentration of the products. The relative amounts of cross-linked products were calculated by deconvolution of the FPLC traces using the software Origin™ from Microcal Software, Inc. (Northampton, MA). The deconvolution method relies on curve-fitting the chromatograph with a priori specification of the number of Gaussian peaks contained in the data. Reverse Phase HPLC Analysis of the Cross-linked Heme Species—The reverse-phase HPLC analysis of the cross-linked heme species was adapted from the method of LeBrun et al. (41LeBrun L. Hoch U. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12755-12761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to a final concentration of 20 μm in heme and were analyzed on a Poros R2, 4.6 × 100-mm, perfusive particule column from Perceptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA). The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and solvent B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile), and the column was eluted at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The bound and unbound heme species were separated with a linear stepwise gradient of 30% solvent B for 3 min, 30–50% solvent B from 9.5 to 13 min, and 95% solvent B from 13 to 18 min and then adjusted back to 30% solvent B for 2 min. The free heme eluted at 6.0 min and oxidatively modified polar hemes at 2.8 and 3.2 min and the bound heme at around 7.5 min. The heme group and the protein were monitored at 400 and 214 nm, respectively. Enzymatic Digestion of Monomeric and Oligomeric Forms of SwMb—Since acid and alkaline hydrolysis destroy Trp and some Trp and Tyr derivatives, proteases were used to digest the monomeric and oligomeric forms of SwMb. The enzymatic digestion was adapted from the method of Garner et al. (42Garner M.H. Garner W.H. Gurd F.R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 249: 1513-1518Google Scholar). A 750 μm SwMb stock solution in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was incubated with 1.0 eq of H2O2 for 1 min at 25 °C. The resulting mixture was subjected to FPLC on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column, as described above. The fractions corresponding to monomeric and dimeric forms of SwMb (as assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis) were pooled in two lots. Each lot was desalted over prepacked Sephadex G-25 (PD 10; Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration cartridges and was concentrated to 125 μm by ultrafiltration (Centricon YM 10; Amicon; molecular weight cut-off = 10,000). A 400-μl sample of each concentrated fraction was taken for analysis. After adjustment to pH 8.5, protease type X was added to a final protein/protein ratio of 1:10 (w/w), and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. This step was followed by a treatment at pH 5.2 with carboxypeptidase Y (1:10, w/w) for 8 h at 30 °C and a further treatment at pH 7.2 with leucine aminopeptidase (1:10, w/w) for 8 h at 25 °C. The reactions were stopped by injecting the final mixtures directly onto a reverse phase HPLC column. Reverse Phase HPLC Analysis of SwMb Proteolytic Hydrolysates— Dityrosine and isodityrosine standards or SwMb hydrolysate samples were injected onto a Vydac 218TP54, 4.6 × 250-mm, C18 reverse phase HPLC column. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with a linear gradient rising from 100% solvent A to 10% solvent B in 45 min: solvent A, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. A rapid gradient to 90% solvent B and then back to 100% solvent A was then run in order to regenerate the column. The eluent was monitored with a UV-visible detector set at 216 and 280 nm. Fluorescent compounds were detected with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer (λex = 280 nm, λem = 410 nm) coupled in-line with the HPLC system. Peak quantification was based on peak area relative to peaks of a chromatogram of authentic standards separated under identical conditions. Titration of SwMb with H 2 O 2 —The reaction of SwMb with H2O2 produces a peroxidase-like oxoferryl (FeIV=O) species and a transient protein radical. The relationship between the extent of ferryl"
https://openalex.org/W2020277950,"Mutations in palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) have been found to cause the infantile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, which is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by impaired degradation of fatty acid-modified proteins with accumulation of amorphous granular deposits in cortical neurons, leading to mental retardation and death. Palmitoyl protein thioesterase-2 (PPT2) is a second lysosomal hydrolase that shares a 26% identity with PPT1. A previous study had suggested that palmitoyl-CoA was the preferred substrate of PPT2. Furthermore, PPT2 did not hydrolyze palmitate from the several S-palmitoylated protein substrates. Interestingly, PPT2 deficiency in a recent transgenic mouse model is associated with a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, suggesting that PPT1 and -2 perform non-redundant roles in lysosomal thioester catabolism. In the current paper, we present the crystal structure of PPT2 at a resolution of 2.7 Å. Comparisons of the structures of PPT1 and -2 show very similar architectural features; however, conformational differences in helix α4 lead to a solvent-exposed lipid-binding groove in PPT1. The limited space between two parallel loops (β3-αA and β8-αF) located immediately above the lipid-binding groove in PPT2 restricts the binding of fatty acids with bulky head groups, and this binding groove is significantly larger in PPT1. This structural difference accounts for the ability of PPT2 to hydrolyze an unbranched structure such as palmitoyl-CoA but not palmitoylcysteine or palmitoylated proteins. Furthermore, differences in fatty acid chain length specificity of PPT1 and -2, also reported here, are explained by the structure and may provide a biochemical basis for their non-redundant roles.

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) 1The abbreviations used are: NCL, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; PPT, palmitoyl protein thioesterase. is a family of autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders characterized clinically by impaired vision, mental retardation, ataxia, and seizures. Histopathological findings of NCL include accumulation of autofluorescent material and neuronal depletion of the brain cortex accompanied by astrocytogliosis (1Santavuori P. Brain Dev. 1988; 10: 80-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Traditionally NCLs are classified as infantile, late infantile, juvenile, and adult based on the age of the patient and severity of symptoms at the onset and by differences in morphology of the lysosomal storage material (granular osmiophilic deposits in infantile NCL, curvilinear deposits in late infantile NCL, and fingerprint inclusions in juvenile NCL) (2Peltonen L. Savukoski M. Vesa J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the gene encoding palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) are the cause of infantile NCL, which is the most severe form of NCL (3Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). PPT1 has also been associated with some cases of late infantile and juvenile NCL as well (4Mitchison H.M. Hofmann S.L. Becerra C.H. Munroe P.B. Lake B.D. Crow Y.J. Stephenson J.B. Williams R.E. Hofman I.L. Taschner P.E. Martin J.J. Philippart M. Andermann E. Andermann F. Mole S.E. Gardiner R.M. O'Rawe A.M. Hum. Mol.

Metab. 1999; 66: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Biochemical experiments have revealed that PPT1 possesses thioesterase activity against fatty acid thioesters with 14–18 carbons, including palmitoyl-CoA, and fatty acid-modified proteins, such as H-Ras/p21 and other proteins involved in cell signaling (6Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second lysosomal enzyme with thioesterase activity was identified in our laboratory and was designated palmitoyl protein thioesterase-2 (PPT2). Enzymatic studies revealed that PPT2 has thioesterase activity against palmitoyl-CoA, but it is unable to remove palmitate groups from several S-palmitoylated proteins (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Full-length PPT2 consists of 302 amino acids and is only 26% identical in amino acid sequence to PPT1. Residues 1–27 at the N terminus constitute a signal peptide that is cleaved from the mature protein (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). RNA blot hybridization of human tissues has shown that PPT2 is found in variable amounts with notably high expression in muscle. PPT2 expression is diffuse throughout the brain with particularly high levels in the granular layer of the cerebellum and moderate expression in the pons, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus (9Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). On the other hand, high levels of expression of PPT1 are seen in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the thalamus, and the hippocampus as well as the pons and various nuclei of the medulla. An alternatively spliced form of PPT2, in which 46 novel amino acids replace 47 amino acids from the C terminus, has been identified (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This alternatively spliced version of PPT2 is catalytically inactive because it lacks His-289, which is one of the residues of the catalytic triad. Targeted deletions in either PPT1 or -2 genes in mice cause a neurological disorder closely resembling human NCL (9Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), with PPT1 deficiency showing earlier and more severe manifestations than PPT2 deficiency. By 10 months of age, most PPT1 knockout mice are dead, whereas mortality in the PPT2 knockout mice is only 20%; however, most mice show spasticity by that age. The crystal structure of PPT1 alone and in complex with palmitate solved in our laboratory (10Bellizzi III, J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) showed that PPT1 has an α-β hydrolase fold with an additional lipid binding domain. This information provided the structural basis for understanding the severity of phenotypes associated with different PPT1 mutations. To provide similar insights into PPT2 and more generally into the pathology of NCLs, we solved the crystal structure of PPT2. The atomic structure presented in this report reveals that PPT2 consists of a catalytic core with an α-β hydrolase fold and a lipid-binding pocket. The structure of PPT2 shows that even though the amino acid sequence identity between PPT1 and -2 is only 18%, the two proteins have very similar three-dimensional structures. Variations in the architecture of the α-β hydrolase and the lipid-binding pocket between the two proteins are important factors in determining substrate specificity and catalytic activity. Protein Expression and Purification—Human PPT2 was overexpressed using an insect cell-baculovirus expression system. Protein was secreted into the cell medium at an approximate concentration of 0.5 mg/liter. Cell media was adjusted to 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 2 m NaCl and loaded into a butyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column. A gradient from 2 to 500 mm NaCl was used to elute the protein, which was subsequently dialyzed against a solution containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 50 mm NaCl, and loaded onto an ion exchange (Q-Sepharose, Amersham Biosciences) column. A gradient from 50 to 400 mm NaCl was used to elute the protein, which was subsequently dialyzed against a solution containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. The final PPT2 preparation was assessed to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Crystallization and Structure Determination—PPT2 crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Two microliters of protein (15 mg/ml) were mixed with an equal volume of a solution containing 2 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm sodium cacodylate (pH range 5.5–6.5), and 8% methyl-pentanediol to produce crystals diffracting to a resolution of 2.7 Å. All diffraction experiments were collected using synchrotron radiation at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS). An oscillation step of 1° was used throughout, and the crystal-to-detector distance was set to 200 mm. Raw reflection intensities were reduced using Denzo and Scalepack (22Otwinowsky Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P6(2Peltonen L. Savukoski M. Vesa J. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The structure of PPT2 was solved using PPT1 (Protein Data Bank code 1EI9, Ref. 10Bellizzi III, J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, N-acetylcysteamine in dichloromethane was cooled to 0 °C, triethylamine was added and stirred for 5 min, and palmitoyl chloride was added dropwise under stirring for 30 min at room temperature.

Hydrolysis of the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-S-palmitoyl-β-d-glucoside was performed by the method of van Diggelen et al. (12van Diggelen O.P. Keulemans J.L. Winchester B.

Site-directed Mutagenesis, COS Cell Transfection, and Analysis of PPT2 Mutants—The plasmid pCMV5-hPPT2 (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotides (38-mer) with desired mutations were used in an extension reaction using the vector and Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase in a thermocycler. Wild-type parental strands were digested with DpnI, and mutated DNA was transformed into XL1-Blue-competent cells. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire DNA insert to verify the presence of the mutation and the absence of extraneous mutations. Simian COS-1 cells were maintained in 60-mm dishes and transiently transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA in the presence of 6 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). The cells were harvested 60–72 h post-transfection and were sonicated immediately in homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenates were spun at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were assayed for palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase using [3H]palmitate-labeled palmitoyl-CoA as described by Das et al. (13Das A.K.

Aliquots were also subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-PPT2 antibodies to analyze PPT2 expression levels (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of PPT2—The atomic structure of PPT2 (residues 35–302) consists of three domains: an α-β hydrolase domain, a lipid binding domain (or cap domain), and an accessory domain (Fig. 1). Residues 35–145, 202–240, and 280–308 conform to an α-β hydrolase fold consisting of six parallel β strands, β3–8, arranged in the order β4-β3-β5-β6-β7-β8 (Fig. 1). The numbering of the β strands and α helices corresponds to the nomenclature of the canonical α-β hydrolase fold (14Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. et al.Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). The β strands are partially surrounded by four α helices, αA, αB, αC, αD, and αF. Compared with the canonical α-β hydrolase fold, PPT2 lacks the first two antiparallel β strands β1 and -2. The α-β hydrolase fold constitutes the core of PPT2 and includes the catalytic triad formed by Ser-111, His-283, and Asp-228 (Fig. 1). Two intramolecular disulfide bonds, Cys-109 to Cys-115 and Cys-277 to Cys-295, help stabilize the hydrolase core. The first one, Cys-109 to Cys-115, links β6 to αC, fixing the position of the sharp “elbow” that contains the nucleophile residue Ser-111 (Fig. 1). The second disulfide bond, Cys-277 to Cys-295, secures the position of the catalytic His by linking β8 to αF and fixing the position of the loop joining these two secondary structure elements. Interestingly, the position of the catalytic histidine residue (His-286) in Pseudomonas cepacia lipase (15Nardini M. Lang D.A. Liebeton K. Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) is fixed by an octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ ion bridging helix αE with the loop that contains His-286. The lipid binding domain constitutes an insertion to the α-β fold and is located between strand β6 and helix αD (Fig. 1). This domain consists of a series of small α helices, α4–9 (residues 136–208), which forms a binding pocket for the substrate. The pocket is composed of a groove (α5–9, residues 154–208) covered by a lid (α4, residues 147–153). An intramolecular disulfide bridge, Cys-165 to Cys-176, stabilizes the floor of the groove. The accessory domain (residues 234–280) (Fig. 1) is also an extension of the α-β hydrolase fold and replaces helix αE in the canonical fold. It is formed by helices α10–13 and a β hairpin (βa and -b). The function of this small domain is unknown. The amino acid sequence of PPT2 contains five potential N-linked glycosylation sites at residues Asn-60, -190, -206, -245, and -289. Of these potential sites we can see clear electron density for a molecule of N-acetylglucosamine at residue Asn-190 in the lipid binding domain. The electron density for the rest of the sites is too weak to be interpretable. The Catalytic Triad—The catalytic triad (Fig. 2a) is composed of residues Ser-111, Asp-228, and His-283, which are located at their expected positions within the α-β hydrolase fold. These assignments are consistent with in vitro expression data in COS cells. Mutation of Ser-111, Asp-228, or His-283 to Ala abolished PPT2 activity, whereas mutation of the nearby His-287 had no effect (Fig. 2b). Ser-111 is found at the junction between strand β3 and helix α4 at the so-called “nucleophilic elbow” and has the unfavorable geometry (Ramachandran plot) of φ = 45°, ϕ = -128°, which is a characteristic of this feature. The sequence motif surrounding the nucleophilic serine (Ser-111) shared by most lipases and thioesterases, Ψ-X-Ψ-X-Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly-Gly-X-X-Ψ (where Ψ is any hydrophobic residue), is fairly conserved in PPT2. Two substitutions (indicated in bold), Cys-109 for Gly and Cys-115 for Ψ, allow the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge that plays an important role in stabilizing Ser-111 (see above). The positions of the residues of the catalytic triad with respect to each other are critical for the catalytic activity of the α-β hydrolase fold. A network of hydrogen bonds among the residues of the catalytic triad and with neighboring residues appears to help organize the catalytic site of PPT2. The catalytic triad residues form hydrogen bonds with each other in the fashion expected (Fig. 2a) (Ser-111 (OG)-His-283 (NE2) = 2.71 Å and Asp-228 (OD2)-His-283 (ND1) = 2.95 Å). Among the hydrogen bonds between the catalytic triad residues and the neighboring residues are His-283 (N)-Tyr-110 (OH) (2.61 Å), which cross-links the loop containing His-283 with β5 containing Ser-111. In addition, Ser-111 makes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-133 and the amide nitrogen of Gly-112 (Ser-111 (N)-Leu-133 (O) = 2.94 Å and Ser-111 (N)-Gly-112 (N) = 3.55 Å). Also part of the network with neighboring residues are the hydrogen bonds that the carboxylic oxygen atoms of Asp-228 make with the main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Val-229, Ile-230, and Trp-286 (Asp-228 (OD1)-Val-229 (N) = 3.00 Å, Asp-228 (OD1)-Ile-230 (N) = 2.87 Å, and Asp-228 (OD2)-Trp-286 (N) = 2.51 Å) and with the hydroxyl oxygen atom of Ser-136 (Asp-228 (OD2)-Ser-136 (OG) = 2.73 Å). A water with a low B-factor (16 Å2) forms a hydrogen bond with Ser-111 (OG) (2.86 Å) and with the amide nitrogen atoms of Gln-116 (3.07 Å) and Leu-41 (3.16 Å). This hydrogen bond network has His-283 as the common vertex of two linked triangles. The vertices of the first triangle are Ser-111, Tyr-110, and His-283; the vertices of the second triangle are Asp-228, Trp-286, and His-283. Structure Comparisons between PPT2 and -1—Although the sequence identity between PPT2 and -1 is only 18% (Fig. 3a), their three-dimensional structures are very similar with an overall root mean square difference for Cα atoms of 1.25 Å (Fig. 3b). The spatial relation of the catalytic triad with respect to the elements of the fold and the positions that the residues hold with respect to each other and with other residues is well preserved between the two proteins. The catalytic residues in PPT1, Ser-115, Asp-233, and His-289, have an average root mean square difference for their Cαs of 0.3, 0.7, and 1.08 Å, respectively, with the corresponding residues of PPT2. The hydrogen bonds within the catalytic triad are also present in PPT1. The hydrogen bonds from Ser-115 to the Gly-116 amide nitrogen Ser-115 (O)-Gly-116 (N) (3.2 Å) and to the Val-139 carbonyl oxygen Ser-115 (N)-Val-139 (O) (3.1 Å) are conserved between the two structures. Both PPT1 and -2 have a lipid-binding groove leading away from the active site. This groove, which holds the fatty acid portion of the thioester to be cleaved, is very similar in both proteins (Fig. 4a). Although some residue types are not the same, the positions are very similar. The conserved residues Leu-161, Tyr-178, and Trp-179 have root mean square Cα deviations of 0.9, 0.5, and 0.6 Å, respectively. The Ala-171/Ala-183 pair in PPT1 is substituted in PPT2 by Cys-165/Cys-176 and has root mean square Cα deviations of 0.8 and 0.5 Å, respectively. The two cysteine residues form a disulfide bridge located 3.8 Å below the plane of the palmitate observed in PPT1. The substitution of Ile-175 in PPT2 for the polar residue Gln-182 in PPT1 would not be expected to affect lipid binding because Gln-182 makes contacts with the lipid through its Cβ and Cγ atoms. Despite the fact that we have not yet obtained the structure of PPT2 in complex with a substrate (e.g. palmitate) or an inhibitor, the overlap between the two structures shows that the palmitate in PPT1 fits almost perfectly inside the PPT2-binding groove. Minor rearrangements in the groove would have to occur in the side chain of Leu-161 upon lipid binding. Contrary to the similarities observed in the binding groove, superposition of the two structures at the β6-α4 loop in PPT2 (β6-α4 in PPT1) shows striking differences. As illustrated in Fig. 4b the main chain of loop β6-α4 in both proteins runs almost parallel to the palmitate. At Pro-150 the β6-α4 loop of PPT1 makes a right angle turn in a direction opposite to the binding groove, and as a result it is exposed to solvent. We refer to this as the open conformation (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the position of this loop is stabilized by a disulfide bridge formed by Cys-152 to Cys-160 and by a hydrogen bond Arg-151 (NE)-Thr-234 (OG) (3.02 Å). In contrast, the β6-α4 loop of PPT2 turns roughly 60° (Fig. 4a) toward the binding groove, allowing helix α4 to form the lid of a binding pocket (Fig. 5a). This change to a closed conformation buries a surface area of 1250 Å2. To accommodate a hydrophobic substrate the inner surface of helix α4 is lined with hydrophobic residues and makes weak contacts with residues from the binding groove (Leu-149 (CD1)-Leu-161 (CD1), Leu-152 (CD1)-Ile-175 (CD1), and Phe-153 (CZ)-Phe-173 (CE2)). None of the residues of helix α4 make hydrogen bonds with nearby residues, and helix α4 is described as the lid of the active site. Previous experiments in the laboratory had shown that PPT1 and -2 had thioesterase activity against many palmitate substrates but that there was a group of substrates (palmitate bound to the CAAX box of H-Ras for example) for which PPT2 had no thioesterase activity (8Soyombo A.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27456-27463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To study the substrate specificity more carefully and to find possible PPT2 substrates for which PPT1 has no activity, we performed a series of experiments in which either the fatty acid head group or fatty acid chain length was varied. Probing Thioester Head Groups—The data in Table II show that both PPTs have similar activity against linear molecules such as S-palmitoyl-CoA or S-palmitoyl-N-acetylcysteamine; however, the activity of PPT2 against substrates with “branched” or bulky head groups, such as S-palmitoyl-H-Ras, S-palmitoyl-N-acetyl-O-carboxymethyl-cysteine, or 4-methylumbelliferyl-6-S-palmitoyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, was almost undetectable (Table II). The structures of PPT1 and -2 help explain the head group specificity. In both structures, the β3-αA loop and the β8-αF loop are parallel to each other and are directly above the lipid binding site; therefore, an intact substrate must fit between these two loops. As shown in Fig. 6a, the separation between these loops is larger in PPT1 than in PPT2 by roughly 8 Å (on average). Hence PPT2 cannot bind lipid groups with branched side chains because there is simply not enough space in this region to accommodate them. The presence of a vicinal disulfide bridge (Cys-45 to Cys-46) in the β3-αA loop of PPT1 (Fig. 6a) suggests that the wider separation in PPT1 is enforced by this disulfide bond.Table IIComparisons of structure-activity relationships of PPT1 and -2Fig. 6Fatty acid specificity. a, Corey-Pauling-Koltun and ribbons representation of a superimposition between residues in loops β3-αF and β8-αF in PPT2 (steel blue) and PPT1 (red). The orientation used in this figure is the same orientation used in Fig. 4. The position of the palmitate residue corresponds to the position observed in the crystal structure of PPT1 (for review, see “Results and Discussion”) (10Bellizzi III, J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.Y.

Fatty acyl CoAs of varying chain length were examined. Values shown are the average of three sets of experiments expressed as a percentage of maximum activity using C14:0 as a substrate for PPT1. Absolute maximal values were 1.0 and 2.1 μmol of acyl CoA hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein for PPT1 and -2, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Probing Fatty Acid Chain Length—Previous experiments have shown that PPT1 is able to hydrolyze long chain fatty acyl CoAs with an optimum fatty acid chain length of 14–18 carbons (7Camp L.A. Verkruyse L.A. Afendis S.J. Slaughter C.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 6b, we examined the catalytic activity of PPT1 and -2 as a function of fatty acid chain length (Fig. 6b). First of all, the activity of both proteins against 14–18 carbon fatty acids is similar. More importantly, PPT2 has significantly higher thioesterase activity against lipids with chain lengths of fewer than 10 carbons or lipids with very large chain lengths (18 or more carbon atoms). Comparison of the architecture of the binding site between the two proteins provides the structural basis for these data. Fig. 4a shows that PPT1 cannot bind lipid chains below 10 carbons because they are not long enough to make contacts with Trp-186, Gln-182, and Tyr-185, which probably hold the lipid firmly in the binding site. On the other hand, PPT2 can bind shorter lipids (above six carbons) because the lid has additional contacts that facilitate binding (Figs. 4b and 5b). Conclusions—The crystal structure of PPT2 reveals that the core of the protein possesses an α-β hydrolase fold with a catalytic triad formed by residues Ser-111, Asp-228, and His-283. Two disulfides help fix the position of Ser-111 and His-283. An extension to the α-β hydrolase fold of six small α helices forms a lipid binding domain. The lipid binding domain of PPT2 forms a binding pocket for the fatty acid chain that consists of an α4 and a binding groove formed by α5–9. Residues lining the interior surface of the lid are hydrophobic and make weak contacts (≥3.5 Å) with residues in the binding groove. The presence of a lid in PPT2 is worthy of comment as similar lid subdomains are found in the atomic structures of bacterial lipases. Topologically the bacterial lipases consist of a variant of the α-β hydrolase fold and a cap domain, which includes a lid subdomain (helices α4 and -5). The catalytic triad in bacterial lipases is buried (16Schrag J.D. Li Y. Cygler M. Lang D. Burgdorf T. Hecht H.J. Schmid R. Schomburg D. Rydel T.J. Oliver J.D. Strickland L.C. Dunaway C.M. Larson S.B.

Des. 2000; 8: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (112) Google Scholar); the substrate gains access into the active site when a large hinge motion displaces the lid subdomain sidewise (18Lang D.

Frenken L.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Bacterial lipases with a buried catalytic triad and a buried lipid binding site, on one hand, and PPT1 with an exposed catalytic triad and an exposed lipid binding site represent the extremes. In PPT2, the exposed catalytic triad and buried lipid binding site represent a middle position where the substrate gains access to the lipid-binding groove after displacing the lid subdomain. Fig. 4a shows that a modeled palmitate residue fits fairly well inside the binding groove of PPT2, which is rigidified by a disulfide bridge. As the hydrophobic residues lining α4 (Leu-152, Leu-155, and Phe-156) are located within 1.5–2 Å of the modeled palmitate, it is likely that substrate binding is accompanied by displacement of α4. The comparison of PPT1 and -2 gives an idea of how the lid could move (Fig. 4b). The main chains of PPT1 and -2 diverge at the conserved residue Gly-148 in both structures (β6-α4 loop) to converge again at residue Arg-164 in PPT2 (α4-α5 loop). These two residues might be the hinge residues for the motion of the lid. Because the residues lining helix α4 are hydrophobic the range of motion of the lid is probably small, allowing the lid residues to make contact with the bound substrate. The results of previous transgenic mouse experiments have shown that deletion of either PPT1 or -2 can cause an NCL disorder (9Gupta P. Soyombo A.A. Atashband A. Wisniewski K.E. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13566-13571Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although both enzymes share some common substrates, the fact that there is a distinct phenotype associated with each knockout implies that there are also substrates that are unique to each enzyme. In the current paper, we show that PPT1 hydrolyzes palmitoyl protein substrates, whereas PPT2, because of structural constraints, cannot accommodate palmitoyl cysteine or palmitoylated proteins. Conversely, we show that PPT2 hydrolyzes both long and short chain fatty acyl CoA substrates, whereas PPT1 has a more restricted range of fatty acyl chain lengths. Furthermore, the structure of PPT2 presented in this report provides new insights toward understanding the divergent substrate specificities of PPT1 and -2. It appears that the presence of the lid in PPT2 facilitates the binding of short (<14 carbons) or very large (≥18 carbons) fatty acids. On the other hand, the binding of fatty acids with branched or bulky head groups is possible in PPT1 but not in PPT2 due to the restricted space between the β8-αF and β3-αA loops. In summary, differences in the structures of PPT1 and -2 are shown to lead to unique substrate specificities, a finding that is consistent with the non-redundant roles of the two thioesterases in lysosomal lipid metabolism."

Biochem. 1999; 259: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The increased ATP/ADP ratio results in the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channels) and subsequent cellular depolarization (6Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In turn, depolarization causes the activation of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels that result in the influx of extracellular calcium. This increased intracellular calcium then serves as a trigger for the initial fusion of insulin-containing dense core granules with the plasma membrane (8Heinemann C. Chow R.H. Neher E. Zucker R.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 267: 2546-2557Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). Although the calcium trigger mechanism, trafficking, and fusion of insulin granules have not been fully elucidated, recent studies have suggested that the majority of granules that initially fuse with the plasma membrane are localized beneath the plasma membrane in a bound (docked) state (10Dean P.M. Diabetologia. 1973; 9: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 11Anello M. Gilson P. Henquin J.C. Br. J.

This pool of insulin granules has been referred as the readily releasable pool, and it appears to account for the first phase of stimulus-mediated insulin secretion (13Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This initial release process requires the functional interactions of the t-SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; t-SNARE, target-SNARE; v-SNARE, vesicle-associated-SNARE; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2; RT, reverse transcriptase; SNAP25, synaptosome-associated proteins of 25 kDa; WT, wild type; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. proteins, syntaxin 1 and SNAP25, with the v-SNARE protein, VAMP2. For example, the use of SNARE mutants or various SNARE protein-specific proteolytic toxins prevent regulated insulin secretion (14Wheeler M.B. Sheu L. Ghai M. Bouquillon A. Weller U. Beaudoin A.R.

However, since these endotoxins do not proteolyze complexed SNARE proteins, it is thought that the plasma membrane-bound (docked) insulin granules first undergo a priming step (core SNARE complex formation) followed by SNARE-mediated fusion. During our investigation of SNARE protein complexes, we observed that the regulated insulin-secreting pancreatic β cell line, βHC-9, not only expressed syntaxin 4 but also expressed the specific syntaxin 4-interacting protein, Synip. In this study, we demonstrate that syntaxin 4 also plays a role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and that this process may be negatively regulated by the syntaxin 4-interacting protein Synip. Materials—The FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma, and syntaxin 4 sheep polyclonal and Synip rabbit polyclonal antibodies were prepared and affinity-purified as described previously (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). ECL+plus Western blotting detection system and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The anti-sheep and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Pierce. The VAMP2 antibody was purchased from Calbiochem, and all restriction enzymes, cell culture media, and reagents were from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—βHC-9 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Hanahan (University of California at San Francisco) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 20 mm glutamine, under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Electroporation of βHC-9 Cells—To obtain a high degree of transfection efficiency necessary for insulin secretion assay, immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting of whole cell extracts, βHC-9 cells were electroporated with a total of 300 μg of plasmid DNA at 950 microfarads and 0.2 kV as described previously (20Okada S. Mori M. Pessin J.E. Diabetes Mellitus: Methods and Protocols. 83. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2003: 93-96Google Scholar). Within this condition, ∼70% of the cells were functionally transfected as determined by in situ staining for the expression of β-galactosidase activity. Forty-eight h following transfection, the cells were washed twice in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer composed of 129 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO2, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mm glucose. After washing, the cells were preincubated for 1 h in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and either untreated or incubated for 10 or 30 min in the presence of 30 mm d-glucose prior to the preparation of insulin assay or whole cell extracts. In Situ β-Galactosidase Staining—After 48 h following transfection, βHC-9 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 2.6 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed and incubated with 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) reagent in 10 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 3.3 mm Fe(CN)6, pH 7.0, for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then stored in 70% glycerol and photographed at ×100 magnification. Northern Blot and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)—The 1.67-kb fragment of the Synip cDNA coding sequences was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random hexamer labeling kit, and the probe was purified with a QIAquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). The probe was hybridized to a Northern blot containing 2 μg of purified poly(A)+ RNA isolated from βHC-9 cells and 3T3L1 adipocytes for 16 h at 65 °C. The blot was then extensively washed following the manufacturer's recommendations and subjected to autoradiography at –70 °C. RT-PCR was performed by using a cDNA synthesis system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendation with a pair of oligonucleotides: 5′-GTACTGACCCGGGAATTCGAAAGCATGAGTGATGGTACAGC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACGCGGCCGCTCGAGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGT CCTTGTAGTCG-3′. RT-PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, and a specific single band was extracted from agarose gel. The extracted and purified RT-PCR products were applied on a PRISM model 310 autosequencer (PE Applied Biosynthesis, Tokyo, Japan) for analysis of sequence. Western Blots—Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The samples were immunoblotted with monoclonal or polyclonal specific antibody as indicated in the figures and figure legends. The primary monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies (except for PY20-horseradish peroxidase) for immunoblots were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Pierce). Specific signals were visualized, scanned, and analyzed by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Synip/ΔEF—Deletion of the EF-hand motif of Synip was prepared by designing an upstream primer containing an EcoRI site for just up-stream of ATG. In this case, upstream primer design was 5′-GAATTCATGAGTGATGGTACAGCTTCTGCC-3′, and the lower primer design was 5′-CTTAAGGCGAACAGAAGGATTTAG-3′. To amplify the Synip part of the right after the EF hand motif through the stop codon, we designed 5′-GGAGATTTCGTCCAGGTTGCCAGA-3′ oligonucleotide DNA as the upper primer and 5′-CTCGAGTCAGCTTTTCGGGTCTGTTAGCTC-3′ oligonucleotide DNA as the lower primer. We inserted the FLAG epitope tag before the stop codon and the XhoI site after the stop codon. Thereafter, pcDNA3 vector was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and triple ligation was attempted with amplified two of Synip PCR products. Insulin Secretion under Static Incubation Conditions—Insulin release was determined as described previously with minor modifications (8Heinemann C. Chow R.H. Neher E. Zucker R.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 267: 2546-2557Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Following electroporation and stimulation, the cell medium was collected for analysis by an insulin radioimmunoassay. A total amount of cell protein was determined by extraction of the cells with a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and used to normalize for the amount of insulin release (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were evaluated for statistical significance by analysis of variance and paired Student's t test when appropriate. Insulin Secretion under Perifusion Conditions—The perifusion system was performed as described elsewhere with modifications (13Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In brief, an equal number of electroporated βHC-9 cells were grown on glass coverslips in each experiment; coverslips were then placed in 25-mm Swinnex chambers (Millipore, Bedford, MA) with the cells facing the inside of the chamber. The cells were perifused with Krebs-Ringer buffer and 0.1 mm glucose at 37 °C for a 60-min equilibration period prior to the test periods with 30 mm glucose. Samples were collected at 1- and 2-min intervals for the measurement of insulin secretion. Statistical Analysis—All data expressed as means ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance by analysis of variance or t test. Synip Expression in βHC-9 Cells—Previously, we reported that Synip is expressed in muscle and adipose tissue (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In comparison, Northern blot analysis of RNA from differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes and βHC-9 cells demonstrated the presence of the major 7.5-kb Synip transcript (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, βHC-9 cells expressed a substantially greater amount of Synip mRNA as compared with the differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction also confirmed the presence of the Synip mRNA in both adipocytes and βHC-9 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, consistent with the Northern blot analysis, Synip protein was also more abundant in whole cell extracts from the βHC-9 cells as compared with the differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that the large band above the 70-kDa Synip protein was a non-specific cross-react protein in the 3T3L1 cell extracts. This non-specific cross-react band was not detectable under native conditions but was detectable under denatured conditions, and it is more prominent in 3T3L1 cell extracts as compared with βHC-9 extracts (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In any case, both the 3T3L1 adipocytes and the βHC-9 cells also express syntaxin 4 and VAMP2, although to greatly different extents with syntaxin 4 somewhat more abundant in the adipocytes, whereas VAMP2 was very highly expressed in the βHC-9 cells (Fig. 1B). Transfection of βHC-9 Cells by Electroporation—To establish a rapid transient method to express cDNAs in βHC-9 cells, we developed a modified electroporation procedure as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although the amount of DNA (300 μg) is relatively large, due to the low voltage conditions, this procedure is significantly milder to the cells than standard electroporation conditions. Using this procedure, we routinely procured expression five times higher than the endogenous proteins of interest with greater than 70% protein expression efficiency. As shown in Fig. 2A (panels 2 and 3), 48 h following electroporation with the LacZ cDNA, ∼80% of the cells stained blue for the presence of β-galactosidase activity. Importantly, the electroporated cells are not morphologically different from the non-electroporated cells (Fig. 2A, panel 1). The electroporation of the βHC-9 per se also had no detrimental effect on the ability of these cells to display regulated insulin secretion (see Figs. 5 and 6). Furthermore, expression of a FLAG epitope-tagged Synip demonstrated the co-localization of Synip with endogenous syntaxin 4 by immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 2B, panels 1–3).Fig. 5Overexpression of Synip and a dominant-interfering syntaxin 4 mutant inhibits glucose (Glu)-stimulated insulin secretion. βHC-9 cells were electroporated with the empty pcDNA3 vector, syntaxin 4/ΔTM, Synip/WT, or Synip/ΔEF cDNAs and allowed to recover for 48 h. The cells were then serum-starved for 4 h and left untreated (open bars) or stimulated with 30 mm glucose (solid bars) for 60 min. The amount of insulin released into the medium was determined with an insulin radioimmunoassay. The relative amount of insulin released was compared with the basal level in the empty vector transfected cells. As a control, insulin amount released from non-electroporated cells is also presented.

As shown in A, βHC-9 cells were electroporated with the empty pcDNA3 vector (open circles), the Synip/WT (closed circles), and the syntaxin 4/ΔTM (open squares) cDNAs. The cells were allowed to recover for 48 h and then incubated in serum-free medium for 4 h. The cells were then perifused with 30 mm glucose and samples were removed at various times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The amount of insulin release was determined by insulin radioimmunoassay.

In the basal state (zero time), immunoprecipitation of syntaxin 4 resulted in the co-immunoprecipitation of Synip and VAMP2 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). Glucose stimulation for 10 min resulted in an increase in the amounts of Synip and VAMP2 co-immunoprecipitated with syntaxin 4 (Fig. 3A, lane 2). However, the amounts of Synip and VAMP2 co-immunoprecipitated with syntaxin 4 were reduced following 30 min of glucose stimulation (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The statistical evaluations of Synip and VAMP2 band intensity changes are represented in Fig. 3B. This change associated with syntaxin 4 occurred without any significant effect to the total amount of Synip, syntaxin 4, or VAMP2 protein content in the βHC-9 cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 4–6). In contrast to glucose-stimulated biphasic interaction of VAMP2 with syntaxin 4 in control cells, overexpression of Synip completely prevented any detectable co-immunoprecipitation of VAMP2 with syntaxin 4 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, due to the higher level of Synip expression, glucose was no longer able to induce either an association or a dissociation of Synip with syntaxin 4, suggesting that the majority of functionally available syntaxin 4 is now bound to Synip. Again, glucose stimulation had no significant effect on the amount of expressed Synip or the endogenous syntaxin 4 and VAMP2 proteins (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). As a control, we also expressed a deletion mutant of Synip (Synip/ΔEF) that was unable to significantly bind to syntaxin 4 (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Expression of this mutant had no significant effect on the basal state association of syntaxin 4 with VAMP2 and did not prevent the glucose-stimulated association and subsequent dissociation of VAMP2 from syntaxin 4 (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 and 3). The control total cell extract blots for the constitutive expression of Synip/ΔEF, syntaxin 4, and VAMP2 are shown in Fig. 4B (lanes 4–6). Synip-Syntaxin 4 Interactions Regulate Glucose-stimulated Insulin Secretion—It is well established that the syntaxin 1-SNAP25 complex functions as the primary t-SNARE for the first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (13Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Troitza K. Bratanova-Tochkova T.K. Cheng H. Daniel S. Gunawardana S. Liu Y.J. Mulvaney-Musa J. Schermerhorn T. Straub S.G. Yajima H. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S83-S90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential contribution of syntaxin 4 in this process has not been carefully evaluated. Therefore, to examine the potential physiological role of syntaxin 4 and Synip on insulin secretion, we initially expressed the syntaxin 4/ΔTM. As typically observed in β cell lines, glucose stimulation for 60 min resulted in an approximate 2.0-fold increase of insulin release (Fig. 5, bars 1 and 2). Similarly, glucose stimulation resulted in a 2.2-fold increase of insulin release from empty vector transfected cells (Fig. 5, bars 3 and 4). Although expression of syntaxin 4/ΔTM had no effect on basal insulin release, there was a statistically significant reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 5, bars 5 and 6). Furthermore, expression of Synip/WT inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, whereas expression of Synip/ΔEF had no effect (Fig. 5, bars 7–10). As a control for syntaxin 4 and Synip specificity, we also expressed Synip/WT and examined its binding to syntaxin 1. As reported previously (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the immunoprecipitation of Synip/WT resulted in the co-precipitation of syntaxin 4 but not syntaxin 1 (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that syntaxin 4 and Synip may both play functional roles in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Synip and Syntaxin 4 Have Different Effects on First and Second Phase Insulin Secretion—Although Synip displays high specificity for syntaxin 4, syntaxin 4 is more promiscuous, and in particular, syntaxin 4/ΔTM can also directly interact with VAMP2 (19Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of action of Synip and syntaxin 4/ΔTM to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion may result from different mechanisms. To address this issue, we next examined the effect of Synip and syntaxin 4/ΔTM on first and second phase insulin secretion (Fig. 6A). Empty vector transfected cells displayed a rapid first phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that peaked at ∼3 min and declined over the next 4–5 min. At this time, the second phase was readily apparent with a relative constant rate of insulin secretion over the next 30 min. In contrast, in the case of cells expressing syntaxin 4/ΔTM, there was no significant effect on first phase insulin secretion, but there was a small reduction in second phase secretion (Fig. 6, B and C). However, overexpression of Synip markedly reduced both the first phase as well as the second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (Fig. 6, A–C). Based upon the known binding interactions, these data suggest that syntaxin 4/ΔTM inhibits second phase secretion by binding to VAMP2, which is associated with predocked insulin granules. In contrast, Synip inhibits first and second phase secretion by preventing the initial docking of insulin granules as well as the recruitment of new insulin granules. Thus, Synip appears to regulate first phase insulin secretion as well as the recruitment of new insulin granules through the modulation of syntaxin 4 function. Insulin secretion is a complex regulatory process that can occur through distinct signaling mechanisms and multiple insulin granule pools (21Troitza K. Bratanova-Tochkova T.K. Cheng H. Daniel S. Gunawardana S. Liu Y.J. Mulvaney-Musa J. Schermerhorn T. Straub S.G. Yajima H. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S83-S90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Henquin J.C. Ishiyama N. Nenquin M. Ravier M.A. Jonas J.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S60-S67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the basal unstimulated state, there is a slow constitutive release of insulin that is thought to result from the trafficking and fusion of insulin from the trans-Golgi network and/or immature secretory granules to the plasma membrane (23Palade G.E. Science. 1975; 89: 347-358Crossref Scopus (2341) Google Scholar). However, the majority of insulin is stored in dense core granules within the cell interior and juxtaposed to the plasma membrane (24Barg S. Eliasson L. Renström E. Rorsman P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S74-S82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, glucose stimulation results in a relatively rapid initial release of insulin (first phase) followed by a second slower and more prolonged release of insulin (second phase). It is generally accepted that the first phase of insulin release results from the fusion of plasma membrane predocked insulin granules, termed the readily releasable pool of insulin granules. It is also well established that vesicle fusion first requires the association of granules with the plasma membrane in a process termed tethering (25Cao X.C. Ballew N. Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The tethering process is apparently SNARE-independent but is then converted to a primed or readily releasable state that results from SNARE complex formation (26Whyte R.C.J. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through an unknown mechanism that is calcium-dependent, fusion readily ensues, probably through the formation of SNAREpin complex (27Edwardson J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R390-R393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rothman J.E. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the case of insulin granule fusion, the t-SNARE complex syntaxin 1-SNAP25 directly interacts with the insulin granule v-SNARE protein VAMP2 (29Sadoul K. Berger A. Niemann H. Weller U. Roche P.A. Klip A. Trimble W.S. Regazzi R. Catsicas S. Halban P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33023-33027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This conclusion is based upon the expression of several SNARE protein mutants and the use of various endotoxins that are specific proteases for these proteins (14Wheeler M.B. Sheu L. Ghai M. Bouquillon A. Weller U. Beaudoin A.R. Bennett M.K. Trimble W.S. Gaisano H.Y. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Nagamatsu S. Nakamichi Y. Katahira H.

Although there may be several types of fusion-competent insulin granules, these data suggest that the syntaxin 1-SNAP25-VAMP2 complex plays a predominant role in first phase insulin secretion and is probably responsible for the fusion of the readily releasable pool. Subsequent to the initial single granule fusion event, the SNARE complex must undergo dissociation to recycle and separate the t-SNARE proteins (syntaxin 1-SNAP25) from the v-SNARE protein (VAMP2). In this regard, syntaxin 1 was found to co-immunoprecipitate with VAMP2 prior to glucose stimulation consistent with this complex being responsible for the high affinity association of the releasable pool of insulin granules with the plasma membrane (13Daniel S. Noda M. Straub S.G. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21Troitza K. Bratanova-Tochkova T.K. Cheng H. Daniel S. Gunawardana S. Liu Y.J. Mulvaney-Musa J. Schermerhorn T. Straub S.G. Yajima H. Sharp G.W. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S83-S90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the interaction of syntaxin 1 with VAMP2 was disrupted following glucose stimulation. This latter process appears to be necessary for the recycling of the SNARE proteins to allow for subsequent rounds of insulin granule docking and fusion. The data presented in this manuscript are generally consistent with this model, but our data reveal several important details. First, syntaxin 4 was reported previously not to be involved in the regulation of insulin secretion based upon the overexpression of the full-length syntaxin 4 protein (14Wheeler M.B. Sheu L. Ghai M.

Foster K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18216-18218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the full-length syntaxin 4 protein does not function as a dominant-interfering mutant in other cell systems, and currently, there are no specific endotoxins for the syntaxin 4 isoform. Since β cells also express syntaxin 4 that can interact with VAMP2, it is not unreasonable to expect that syntaxin 4 may play a role, albeit different from that of syntaxin 1. Indeed, we found that expression of a dominant-interfering syntaxin 4 mutant partially inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Second, similar to syntaxin 1, we have observed that the plasma membrane t-SNARE protein syntaxin 4 is also associated with VAMP2 in the basal state. Following glucose stimulation, there was a transient increase in the amount of VAMP2 bound to syntaxin 4 followed by a marked decrease. This dynamic change in the association of VAMP2 with syntaxin 4 occurred independent in any change in either syntaxin 4 or VAMP2 protein levels. Based upon the time frame of these events, we hypothesize that insulin secretory granules utilize the syntaxin 1-SNAP25 complex for the initial membrane fusion and release of insulin. Subsequently, additional granules utilize VAMP2 to associate with syntaxin 4. This accounts for the initial increase in the amount of VAMP2 that co-immunoprecipitates with syntaxin 4. As fusion ensues, the trans-SNARE complexes become cis-SNARE complexes and undergo dissociation and recycling. This then accounts for the decrease in the interaction between VAMP2 and syntaxin 4 at later times. This time frame is also consistent with the function of syntaxin 4 in the second phase of insulin secretion, whereas the syntaxin 1-VAMP2 complex probably functions in the priming and initiation of the first phase insulin secretion. The observation that overexpression of a dominant-interfering syntaxin 4 mutant (syntaxin 4/ΔTM) inhibited second phase but not first phase insulin secretion is consistent with this model. We also found that the syntaxin 4-specific binding protein Synip is highly expressed in βHC-9 cells. Previously, we reported that Synip binding to syntaxin 4 competes for VAMP2 binding and is therefore mutually exclusive (18Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Ceresa B.P. Syu L.J. Noda Y. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of Synip completely prevented the association of VAMP2 with syntaxin 4 before and after glucose stimulation and inhibited glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This effect was unrelated to syntaxin 1 function as Synip did not interact with this t-SNARE isoform. Importantly, overexpression of Synip inhibited second phase insulin secretion consistently with a role for syntaxin 4 in this process. Surprisingly, however, although Synip does not interact with syntaxin 1, overexpression of Synip also reduced first phase insulin secretion. How can Synip inhibit both first and second phase insulin secretion if Synip is a specific syntaxin 4-binding protein? The most likely elucidation is that these are not static complexes but are undergoing successive rounds of docking, fusion, dissociation, and reassociation/docking. Initially, the insulin granules are probably predocked mainly through the syntaxin 1-VAMP2 and partially through syntaxin 4-VAMP2 complex. These complexes may not necessarily be independent as multiple SNARE complexes are required for docking and fusion of a single granule (32Regazzi R. Sadoul K. Meda P. Kelly R.B. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6951-6959Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional complex may be composed of both syntaxin 1-VAMP2 and syntaxin 4-VAMP2 SNAREpins. Following fusion of this readily releasable pool, these core complexes undergo dissociation, allowing for the recycling of the VAMP2 protein. Although this cycle is continuous as part of the first phase of insulin secretion, newly recruited insulin granules or an alternative pre-existing second pool of insulin granules become associated through the syntaxin 4-VAMP2 complex. This secondary pool then fuses with the plasma membrane with the subsequent dissociation of VAMP2. When Synip is overexpressed, this effectively also prevents the reassociation of VAMP2 with syntaxin 4, thereby blocking subsequent rounds of granule docking and fusion. Since first phase secretion is also inhibited after Synip overexpression, these data suggested that the next round of predocking is also dependent on syntaxin 4. Although this model is consistent with the current data, it also implies that Synip must undergo continuous cycling on and off from syntaxin 4. Current studies are now necessary to determine the dynamic reciprocal relationship between VAMP2 and Synip interaction with syntaxin 4. In summary, our data demonstrate that in addition to syntaxin 1, syntaxin 4 also plays a role in the glucose stimulation of insulin secretion. In the basal state, syntaxin 4 is associated with the insulin granule v-SNARE protein, VAMP2. VAMP2 undergoes a glucose-induced dissociation from syntaxin 4. Synip seems to regulate syntaxin 4 readily releasable pool size and affect insulin secretion since overexpression of Synip prevents the association of syntaxin 4 with VAMP2 and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.

RF2a is predicted to include three domains that contribute to its function. The results of transient assays with mutants of RF2a from which one or more domains were removed demonstrated that the acidic domain was essential for the activation of gene expression, although the proline-rich and glutamine-rich domains each played a role in this function. Studies using fusion proteins of different functional domains of RF2a with the 2C7 synthetic zinc finger DNA-binding domain showed that the acidic region is a relatively strong activation domain, the function of which is dependent on the context in which the domain is placed. Data from transgenic plants further supported the conclusion that the acidic domain was important for maintaining the biological function of RF2a. RF2a and TBP (TATA-binding protein) synergistically activate transcription in vitro (Zhu, Q., Ordiz, M. I., Dabi, T., Beachy, R. N., and Lamb, C. (2002) Plant Cell 14, 795–803). In vitro and in vivo assays showed that RF2a interacts with TBP through the glutamine-rich domain but not the acidic domain. Functional analysis of such interactions indicates that the acidic domain activates transcription through mechanisms other than via the direct recruitment of TBP.

Understanding the transcriptional regulation of RTBV is an important factor to elucidate the basis of the disease. RTBV carries a single, vascular tissue-specific promoter with several defined DNA cis-elements (1Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Peng J. Elmer J.S. Laco G. Shen P. Kaniewska M.B. Kononowicz H. Wen F.

Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of RF2a in transgenic plants is sufficient to activate expression of RTBV promoter in other than vascular tissues (6Petruccelli S. Dai S. Carcamo R. Yin Y. Chen S.

Temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression relies largely on the function of gene-specific transcription factors and is achieved by the activity of multiple proteins that bind to regulatory elements and with other proteins to alter basal rates of transcription initiation and/or elongation (7Roeder R.G.

Transacting domains are often characterized as having a high content of specific amino acids, including domains rich in the acidic amino acids, proline or glutamine (14Meshi T. Iwabuchi M.

A. 1994; 91: 11665-11668Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proline-rich and glutamine-rich domains typically act through interactions with TBP, TAFs, and other co-factors (14Meshi T. Iwabuchi M. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 1405-1420PubMed Google Scholar). Although proline-rich and glutamine-rich domains act as activation domains in most of the cases, they can also function as repression domains (23Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher F.J. II I Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 24Licht J.D. Hanna-Rose W. Reddy J.C. English M.A. Ro M. Grossel M. Shaknovich R. Hansen U. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4057-4066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RF2a contains three putative transacting domains, namely proline-rich and acidic domains at the N terminus and a glutamine-rich domain at the C terminus (5Yin Y. Zhu Q. Dai S. Lamb C. Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the function of these domains and their contribution to transcriptional activation by RF2a remain unclear. We reported previously that RF2a interacts with rice TBP and stimulated RTBV promoter activity in an in vitro transcription system (25Zhu Q. Ordiz M.I. Dabi T. Beachy R.N. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Theoretically, each of the three putative functional domains of RF2a has the potential to interact with TBP; however, the role of such interaction(s) in contributing to the transactivating function of RF2a is not clear. To address these questions, the putative functional domains of RF2a were studied by removing one or more domains from RF2a or by fusing individual domains with 2C7 synthetic zinc finger protein, a DNA-binding domain. The abilities of the mutants of RF2a and of the fusion proteins to regulate gene expression were tested. The data of experiments in BY-2 protoplasts and transgenic tobacco plants demonstrate that the acidic domain is the primary activation domain of RF2a. Interactions between mutants of RF2a and rice TBP, in vitro and in vivo, demonstrated that the glutamine-rich domain, rather than the acidic domain, of RF2a directly interacts with TBP. These results support the hypothesis that the acidic domain is critical to the activation function of RF2a and activates transcription through mechanisms other than directly interacting with TBP. Plasmid Constructions for Protein Purification—Mutants of RF2a were created through PCR amplification. A NdeI restriction site was added to 5′ end of all primers, and the ATG in the restriction site was in frame with the His6 tag in vector pET28a (Invitrogen) and served as the transcription start codon for plasmids described under “Plant Expression Constructs with RF2a Deletion Mutants.” A BamHI site was added to all 3′ primers with a stop codon in front of the restriction site. The primers used for amplification of different fragments of RF2a are listed below. The ΔP fragment was amplified using primers RF2a-ΔP5′ and RF2a3′; ΔQ was amplified using primers RF2a 5′ and RF2a-ΔQ3′; ΔPΔA was amplified using primers RF2a-ΔPΔA 5′ and RF2a3′; and ΔPΔQ was amplified using primers RF2a-ΔP5′ and RF2a-ΔQ3′. All of the fragments were restricted with NdeI and BamHI and were cloned into pET28a through the same set of restriction sites. All of the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The derived plasmids were designated pET-RF2a-ΔP, pET-RF2a-ΔQ, pET-RF2a-ΔPΔA, and pET-RF2a-ΔPΔQ. TBP coding sequence was released from pOsTBP2 (25Zhu Q. Ordiz M.I. Dabi T. Beachy R.N. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) through NcoI digestion (made blunt with Klenow DNA polymerase) followed by XhoI digestion. The released fragment was cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) through BamHI (made blunt with Klenow DNA polymerase) and XhoI sites (pGST-TBP) to produce a GST-TBP fusion protein with a thrombin recognition site between GST and TBP. Plant Expression Constructs with RF2a Deletion Mutants—The coding sequences for mutants of RF2a were released from pET28a-derived plasmids and cloned into the plant expression vector pMON999 (a gift from Monsanto company) to place each gene downstream of an enhanced CaMV 35S promoter, followed by a nopaline synthase terminator sequence. The resulting constructs are named p35S:RF2a, p35S: RF2a-ΔP, p35S:RF2a-ΔQ, p35S:RF2a-ΔPΔA, p35S:RF2a-ΔPΔQ, and p35S:RF2a-3Δ. The reporter gene construct, pBII-48Ca:GUS, was built using PCR to introduce the Box II sequence element (4Yin Y. Chen L. Beachy R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) to a minimal CaMV 35S promoter comprising nucleotides –48 to +8 with primers BII-48Ca and GUS 3′ using p35S:GUS plasmid as template. The PCR product was restricted with HindIII and NcoI, and the resulting fragment was inserted into p35S:GUS to replace the 35S promoter. Constructs with RF2a Domains and 2C7 DNA-binding Domain (DBD) Fusion Proteins—To create effectors with RF2a domains fused to the N terminus of 2C7 DBD (26Ordiz M.I. Barbas III, C.F. Beachy R.N. Proc.

BglII and BamHI restriction sites were introduced in the 5′ and 3′ primers. The PCR products were restricted with these set enzymes and cloned into pMON999 through BglII and EcoRI along with the DNA fragment that encodes the 2C7 DNA-binding domain. The latter DNA fragment was released from p35S:2C7 using BamHI and EcoRI (26Ordiz M.I. Barbas III, C.F. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For effectors with RF2a domains at the C terminus of the 2C7 DBD, coding sequences for A, P, Q, and P plus A (PA) domains were released from pET-RF2a-A, pET-RF2a-P pET-RF2a-Q, and pET-RF2a-PA 2I.

The resultant plasmids were named p35S:2C7-A, p35S:2C7-P, p35S:2C7-Q, and p35S:2C7-PA.

The final plasmids were named pGA-E:GUS/P-35S:ΔP, pGA-E:GUS/P-35S:ΔQ, pGA-E:GUS/P-35S:ΔPΔA, and pGA-E:GUS/P-35S:ΔPΔQ.

The pET28a-derived plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for protein expression. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at room temperature for 3 h after the cell density reached A 600 of ∼0.6. His-tagged proteins were purified according to procedures provided by Novagen using nondenaturing conditions. The purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 20% glycerol to remove imidazole and stored at –70 °C. GST-TBP fusion protein was purified using glutathione-cross-linked agarose beads (Sigma). After extensive washing with 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20, GST-TBP fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione and dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline with 20% of glycerol. In some cases, TBP was released from the beads using thrombin (Sigma) digestion. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out essentially as described by Yin and Beachy (2Yin Y. Beachy R.N. Plant J. 1995; 7: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 100 ng of proteins purified from E. coli were incubated with 32P-labeled Box IIm1 DNA probe followed by electrophoresis in a 5% acrylamide gel (4Yin Y. Chen L. Beachy R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For supershift assays, various amounts of TBP were added to the reactions as indicated. The protoplasts were isolated from tobacco cell line BY-2 as described by Watanabe et al. (43Watanabe Y. Meshi T. Okada Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 65-69Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Approximately one million protoplasts were transfected by electroporation with 20 μg of effector DNA, 15 μg of herring sperm DNA, 2.5 μg of reporter gene DNA, and 15 μg of pCat-GFP DNA (constructed by C. Reichel). In samples with reporter gene alone, the total amount of DNA was adjusted by adding 20 μg of herring sperm carrier DNA. The electroporation parameters used were 300 V and 250 microfarads with the Bio-Rad electroporation system. Protoplast samples were cultured in Murashige and Skoog medium with 0.4 m mannitol, pH 5.8, at 28 °C. The protoplasts were collected 24 h after electroporation. Protein samples from protoplasts were prepared using protein extraction buffer (27Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8351) Google Scholar) and quantified using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). GUS activity was measured using 4-methylum-belliferyl-β-d-glucuronide as substrate as described by Jefferson et al. (27Jefferson R.A. Kavanagh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8351) Google Scholar). GFP was quantified by spectrometry with excitation at 460 nm and emission at 510 nm. pGA482-derived plasmids were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 and used for tobacco transformation. Leaf discs from Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi NN were used following the protocol of Horsch et al. (28Horsch R.B. Fry J. Hoffmann N. Neidermeyer J. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: A5Google Scholar). At least 15 independent transgenic lines were produced with each gene construct. Transgenic plants were self-fertilized, and T1 seeds were collected. The T1 seeds were germinated on Murashige and Skoog medium (29Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol.

The transferred proteins were denatured in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for 45 min. The proteins were then renatured by incubation in the same buffer containing decreasing amounts of guanidine hydrochloride (3 m, 1.5 m, 0.75 m, 300 mm, and 100 mm) for 20 min each followed by two washes without guanidine hydrochloride. The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk powder for 1 h before adding 20 μg of GUS-TBP fusion protein to the 3-ml reaction buffer and incubated at 4 °C overnight. After intensive washing with TBST, the membrane was blocked with TBST containing 5% milk for 30 min prior to addition of goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, the membrane was intensively washed with TBST and blocked again with TBST containing 5% milk for another 30 min before adding the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody. The membrane was washed with TBST after 2 h of incubation. The GST was detected by applying Super Signal Substrates for horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. The membrane was then stripped with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 70 °C for 1 h. The membrane-bound proteins of mutants of RF2a were detected through the same Western immunoblot reaction procedure as described below. Protein samples from transgenic tobacco leaf tissues were extracted in buffer (50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.0, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosine) and quantified using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). 40 μg of each protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to monitor protein loading prior to immunodetection. The primary antibody used in the immunodetection was raised in rabbits against full-length RF2a; the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated to goat anti-rabbit antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Whole cell extracts of rice cv. IR72 suspension cultures were used to transcribe a template comprising nucleotides –164 to +45 of the RTBV promoter ligated to the uidA gene as described (5Yin Y. Zhu Q. Dai S. Lamb C. Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Zhu Q. Ordiz M.I. Dabi T. Beachy R.N. Lamb C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein RF2a, mutants of RF2a, and rice TBP2 were added to the reaction mixture 10 min prior to the addition of the whole cell extract. Transcription products were analyzed by primer extension with a primer located in the GUS coding region (2Yin Y. Beachy R.N. Plant J. 1995; 7: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RF2a Mutants with Deletions of Functional Domains Bind to the DNA Target Sequence—In previous studies, we showed that the bZIP protein RF2a enhances transcription in vivo and in vitro (5Yin Y. Zhu Q. Dai S. Lamb C. Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 6Petruccelli S. Dai S. Carcamo R. Yin Y. Chen S. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7635-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Based on the enrichment of amino acids in specific regions of RF2a, we proposed that proline-rich, acidic, and glutamine-rich regions might play specific roles in the function of RF2a (5Yin Y. Zhu Q. Dai S. Lamb C. Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of each region, mutants of RF2a were created by removing one or more of the putative domain(s) (Fig. 1A). The coding sequence for each mutant was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET28a, in which a His6 tag was placed at the N terminus of the fusion protein. The derived plasmids were named pET-RF2a-ΔP, pET-RF2a-ΔQ, pET-RF2a-ΔPΔA, and pET-RF2a-ΔPΔQ. pET-RF2a and pET-RF2a-3Δ were described by Petruccelli et al. (6Petruccelli S. Dai S. Carcamo R. Yin Y. Chen S. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7635-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Proteins from each plasmid are designated RF2a, RF2a-ΔP, RF2a-ΔQ, RF2a-ΔPΔA, RF2a-ΔPΔQ, and RF2a-3Δ, respectively (Fig. 1B). It has been reported that in some cases, protein domains other than the bZIP domain are required for establishing stable protein-DNA complexes (30Haas N.B. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Burch J.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1923-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 4809-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Box IIm1 is a mutant of Box II cis-element with increased binding affinity to RF2a (compared with Box II; 5Yin Y. Zhu Q. Dai S. Lamb C. Beachy R.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5247-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). RF2a and RF2a-3Δ are capable of binding Box IIm1 DNA sequence as either homodimers or heterodimers (6Petruccelli S. Dai S. Carcamo R. Yin Y. Chen S. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7635-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To confirm that each of the mutant proteins bind to the DNA target, gel mobility shift assays were carried out with purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 1B). The data presented in Fig. 1C demonstrate that proteins ΔP, ΔQ, ΔPΔA, ΔPΔQ, and 3Δ of RF2a bind to Box IIm1. Contribution of Sequence Domains to the Function of RF2a— Previous studies demonstrated that phloem-specific expression of the RTBV promoter was retained on a DNA fragment comprising nucleotides –164 to +45 (the “E” fragment) (2Yin Y. Beachy R.N. Plant J. 1995; 7: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Yin Y. Chen L. Beachy R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Tissue specificity of the promoter is governed primarily by Box II, whereas GATA and ASL elements showed strong effects on the level of promoter expression (3He X. Hohn T. Futterer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11799-11808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 4Yin Y. Chen L. Beachy R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To facilitate the analysis of the functions of RF2a and its mutants, a chimeric promoter was developed with a single copy of Box II fused to a minimal CaMV 35S promoter comprising nucleotides –48 to +8. The chimera was ligated to the uidA coding sequence to create the reporter pBII-48Ca:GUS. The activity of this chimeric promoter is about 16% of the activity of RTBV promoter activity and 6.5% of the activity of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter in BY-2 protoplasts (not shown). To analyze the function of domains of RF2a, effectors were created by inserting coding sequences of mutants of RF2a downstream of the enhanced CaMV 35S promoter in pMON999 vector (a gift from Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO). The resultant constructs, p35S:RF2a, p35S:RF2a-ΔP, p35S:RF2a-ΔQ, p35S: RF2a-ΔPΔA, p35S:RF2a-ΔPΔQ, and p35S:RF2a-3Δ, were cotransfected into BY-2 protoplasts with pBII-48Ca:GUS (Fig. 2A). Plasmid pCat-GFP, in which the GFP gene was driven by CaMV 35S promoter, was co-introduced to serve as an internal control. As shown in Fig. 2B, the transactivation function of RF2a was not decreased by removing either the proline-rich (RF2a-ΔP) or glutamine-rich (RF2a-ΔQ) domains or both of the domains (RF2a-ΔPΔQ). In fact, the activation function of each of these mutants was greater than that of full-length RF2a; RF2a-ΔP was significantly different from RF2a at the P 0.05 level, whereas RF2a-ΔQ and RF2a-ΔPΔQ were significantly different from RF2a at the P 0.01 level (Student's t test). Also, the difference between the activity of RF2a-ΔP and RF2a-ΔQ was significant at the P 0.01 level, and there was no difference between RF2a-ΔQ and RF2a-ΔPΔQ. The data suggest that the proline-rich and glutamine-rich domains do not contribute in a positive way to the activation function of RF2a; on the contrary, these domains may reduce the activity of RF2a. In contrast, the activity dropped to near basal level when the acidic domain was removed (RF2a-ΔPΔA and RF2a-3Δ) (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that the acidic domain is responsible for the activation of gene expression by RF2a. Functions of RF2a Domains in Fusion Proteins with 2C7 DBD—To determine whether domains of RF2a can serve as independent modules to regulate transcription, putative functional domains were fused with the synthetic 2C7 protein, a synthetic zinc finger DBD that specifically binds to the 2C7 DNA-binding site (26Ordiz M.I. Barbas III, C.F. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13290-13295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Liu Q. Segal D.J. Ghiara J.B. Barbas C.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5525-5530Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A); domains were placed either at the N terminus or the C terminus of the DBD. The reporter construct pC7er2:GUS carried the uidA coding sequence located downstream of a chimeric promoter comprising 6x2C7-binding sites ligated with the minimal promoter of erbB-2 (26Ordiz M.I. Barbas III, C.F. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13290-13295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). p35S:2C7 encodes the 2C7 protein without an activation domain and served as a control (Fig. 3A) (26Ordiz M.I. Barbas III, C.F. Beachy R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13290-13295Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, when domains of RF2a were placed C-terminal of the 2C7 protein, 2C7-A and 2C7-PA showed significant activation function. When the domains were fused individually at the N terminus of 2C7, the acidic domain (A-2C7) gave stronger activation than the P (P-2C7) or Q (Q-2C7) domains did. The function of the acidic domain in the fusion proteins is consistent with its function in RF2a, although the position of this domain in the fusion proteins affects its activity. The proline- and glutamine-rich domains had no"

In this work, the apical direct biosynthetic route was studied after transfection of polarized enterocyte-like HT-29 5M12 cloned cells with a murine cDNA coding for a soluble form of DPP-IV, which was secreted into the apical medium. A 24-h treatment of transfected cells by GalNAcα-O-bn markedly inhibited the apical secretion and the sialylation of this soluble murine DPP-IV, which became blocked inside the cell. A similar short GalNAcα-O-bn treatment also induced an intracellular distribution of both endogenous transmembrane DPP-IV and proteins involved in the regulation of the apical trafficking such as the apical t-SNARE syntaxin-3 and the raft-associated protein annexin XIIIb, whereas the basolateral t-SNARE syntaxin-4 kept its normal localization. These apical membrane proteins moved efficiently from trans-Golgi network to apical carrier vesicles but failed to be transported from carrier vesicles to the apical plasma membrane. Isolation of membrane microdomains showed that GalNAcα-O-bn induced the formation of abnormal lipid-rich microdomains in comparison to normal rafts, as shown by their lower buoyant density and their depletion in annexin XIIIb. In conclusion, GalNAcα-O-bn blocks the anterograde traffic to the apical surface of polarized HT-29 cells at the transport level or docking/fusion level of carrier vesicles.

In recent years, data of the literature have shown the role of glycosylation in the apical biosynthetic route in polarized epithelial cells. Association of proteins with glycosphingolipids has been proposed for the apical delivery (1Simons K. Van Meer G.

Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). The dynamic clustering of glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains in the TGN would constitute functional rafts for apical delivery of proteins (4Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins of apical destination, such as GPI-anchored proteins, would be specifically recruited in these apical raft carriers. Besides, data obtained by mutation, deletion, or addition of glycosylation sites showed that O- or N-glycosylation could influence the targeting of glycoproteins toward the apical side of the cells (5Danielsen E.M.

The putative role of N- and O-glycans was also shown through the use of drugs affecting their processing, i.e. tunicamycin, deoxymannojirimycin, swainsonine for N-glycans, and 1-benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAc-α-O-bn) for O-glycans (11Alfalah M.

We previously observed that long term treatment of polarized goblet or enterocytic HT-29 cells by GalNAcα-O-bn led (i) to a dramatic inhibition in the secretion of mucins, which are highly O-glycosylated; (ii) to a decrease in the apical membrane expression of brush border markers such as the transmembrane glycoprotein dipeptidylpeptidase-IV (DPP-IV), the GPI-anchored carcinoembryonic antigen, and the mucin-like glycoprotein MUC1; and (iii) to the abnormal presence of these glycoproteins inside the cells (19Huet G.

In contrast, basolateral glycoproteins such as gp120 and gp525 kept a normal localization under GalNAcα-O-bn treatment (19Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A.

These data led us to analyze more deeply the interferences of exogenous GalNAcα-O-bn with the intracellular processes of glycosylation in HT-29 cells. In a previous work, we showed that GalNAcα-O-bn was highly converted into the benzyldisaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAcα-O-bn, which acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal I and involved in the terminal elongation of O-linked glycans (22Delannoy P. Kim I. Emery N. De Bolos C. Verbert A. Degand P. Huet G. Glycoconjugate J. 1996; 13: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thereafter, we reported that GalNAcα-O-bn was extensively metabolized beyond Galβ1–3GalNAcα-O-bn, showing that the glycosylation of endogenous substrates by several glycosyltransferases could be inhibited, and in particular the sialylation of N-glycans by α2,3-sialyltransferase ST3Gal IV (21Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Delmotte P. Steelant W.F.A. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Trugnan G. Delannoy P. Huet G. J.

Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this way, the sialylation of N- and/or O-glycans was found inhibited on the endogenous glycoproteins DPP-IV, MUC1, and GPI-anchored carcinoembryonic antigen, and we suggested that undersialylation of glycoproteins may induce a defect in the direct apical targeting of glycoproteins (19Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J.

Later on, the effect of GalNAcα-O-bn was studied by others using other cell lines, and the induction of a shift from the apical membrane to the basolateral membrane was reported in the targeting of the brush border glycoproteins sucrase isomaltase and DPP-IV using MDCK and Caco-2 cell lines (11Alfalah M.

Trugnan G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the expression of peripheral glycan epitopes is a cell type-specific process that depends on the expression pattern of glycosyltransferases. Interestingly, we and others found that GalNAcα-O-bn treatment of different cell lines in culture did not result in the identical alterations, regarding glycosylation and intracellular trafficking (21Gouyer V.

GalNAcα-O-bn appeared to be an interesting tool to study polarized HT-29 cells, regarding the fact that, in this cell type specifically, (i) the terminal sialylation was identified as the target of inhibition, and (ii) the normal apical localization of brush border glycoproteins was disrupted with intracellular localization. Thus, we investigated the effect of this inhibitor of glycosylation on de novo apical trafficking in enterocyte-like HT-29 cells.

Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 76: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) were cultured as previously described (19Huet G. Hennebicq-Reig S. De Bolos C. Ulloa F. Lesuffleur T. Barbat A. Carriere V. Kim I. Real F.X. Delannoy P. Zweibaum A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 25-cm2 T flasks (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) for cell maintenance and on glass coverslips or 24.5-mm tissue culture-treated Transwell polyester membrane filters (0.4-μm pore size) (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for confocal microscopy and on 6-well culture dishes or 24.5-mm tissue culture-treated Transwell polyester membrane filters for metabolic labeling. GalNAcα-O-bn was used at a concentration of 2 mm in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with fetal bovine serum during a short-term treatment (from 0 to 44 h) starting from confluence. In all experiments, GalNAcα-O-bn had no effect on cell viability, as assessed by the absence of cells in suspension and trypan blue exclusion. For the analysis of cell culture media by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium before collection. Transfection of Soluble Mouse DPP-IV—To generate a secreted mouse DPP-IV (sDPP-IV), the full-length mouse DPP-IV cDNA (29Marguet D. Bernard A.M. Vivier I. Darmoul D. Naquet P. Pierres M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2200-2208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with PvuII restriction enzyme to remove the first 105 nucleotides and was subcloned downstream of a sequence coding for a cleavable peptide signal into the eukaryotic expression vector pTEJ8 that contains the G418 resistance gene (18Ait-Slimane T. Lenoir C. Sapin C. Maurice M. Trugnan G. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HT-29 5M12 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Resistant colonies growing in the presence of 400 μg/ml G148 were isolated using cloning cylinders and screened for secreted DPP-IV activity in the medium. Clone 5M12 Cl2 was selected for further experiments. DPP-IV activity was measured by a kinetic method with the fluorogenic substrate H-Gly-Pro-AMC (Bachem) (21Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Delmotte P. Steelant W.F.A. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Trugnan G. Delannoy P. Huet G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1455-1471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Mouse mAbs 525 against gp525, HBB 3/775/42 against human DPP-IV (30Hauri H.P. Sterchi E.E. Bienz D. Fransen J.A. Marxer A. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 838-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. A. Le Bivic (IBDM, Marseille, France) and Dr. H. P. Hauri (Biocenter of the University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland), respectively. Rat mAbs 1082 and 773 against mouse DPP-IV were obtained from Didier Marguet (Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille Luminy, France). Rabbit antibodies against human syntaxin-3, human annexin XIIIb, and human Munc18-2 were obtained from Dr. A. Le Bivic, Dr. J. Gordon (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) and Dr. M. Kauppi (National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland), respectively. Mouse mAbs against syntaxin-4 (S40220) and against flotillin-1 (clone 1) were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse mAb against human DPP-IV (M-A261) was purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and MALDI Time-of-flight (TOF) Mass Fingerprinting of Tryptic Peptides—HT-29 5M12 Cl2 cells culture media were concentrated and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Amounts used for two-dimensional electrophoresis were normalized to the same amount of cells. Individual 17-cm ReadyStrips IPG strips (Bio-Rad), pH 3–10 or 4–7, were rehydrated with 400 μl of urea buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.4% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Bio-Lytes, 0.28% (w/v) dithiothreitol, 0.2% (v/v) bromophenol blue) containing the sample. Isoelectric focusing was carried out using a Protean IEF Cell according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Prior to the second dimension, the IPG gel strips were equilibrated twice in 10 ml of equilibration solution (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, containing 6 m urea, 3.3% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) SDS) for 20 min, first in the presence of dithiothreitol (65 mm) and then in the presence of iodoacetamide (87 mm). Second dimension gels consisted in a 6–16% acrylamide gradient, cross-linked with piperazine diacrylamide. Gels were run using the Protean II xi Cell (Bio-Rad), at a constant current of 15 mA/gel overnight. The analytical two-dimensional gels were silver-stained and scanned (ImageMaster, Amersham Biosciences). The preparative two-dimensional gels were stained for 4 days in Coomassie Brilliant Blue G solution. Electrophoretically separated proteins were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Gel pieces were reswollen in a trypsin solution containing 0.2 μg of sequence-grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C during 18 h. The protein fragments were extracted with 25 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min. The extracts were pooled, dried, and desalted with micro ZipTip C18 (Millipore) before the MALDI analysis. The peptide mixtures from the tryptic digests were crystallized in a matrix consisting of hydroxycinnaminic acid (Aldrich) prepared in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Spectra were acquired using a PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager-DE STR instrument and were internally calibrated using trypsin-autodigested peptides. The MALDI spectra were explored for database searches using the software Data Explorer (Applied Biosystems). The monoisotopic peptide masses obtained for each protein digest was submitted to Profound software to identify the proteins (prowl.rockfeller.edu/cgi-bin/Profound). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was carried out on HT-29 5M12 cells using a Leica instrument (model TCS-NT) according to Gouyer et al. (21Gouyer V. Leteurtre E. Delmotte P. Steelant W.F.A. Krzewinski-Recchi M.A. Zanetta J.P. Lesuffleur T. Trugnan G. Delannoy P. Huet G. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1455-1471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To detect syntaxin-3, Munc18-2, annexin XIIIb, human DPP-IV, and syntaxin-4, respectively, anti-syntaxin-3 (1/50), anti-Munc18-2 (1/200), anti-annexin XIIIb (1/1000), M-A261 (1/100), or S40220 (1/100) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin/0.2% saponin, were added overnight. Secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody was used. Serial sections of 0.5 μm were performed in z projection. Three xy sections at the top, middle, and bottom of the cell layers, and one xz section, are shown for each experiment. Quantitative analyses were performed by measuring the ratio apical fluorescence/inside fluorescence from confocal images. Fluorescence was quantified on a predefined surface for each section using the quantification program from Leica. The ratio apical fluorescence/inside fluorescence was calculated for the selected sections shown in the illustrations. Vesicle Isolation from Perforated Cells—Isolation of TGN-derived vesicles was carried out according to the procedure described by Wandinger-Ness et al. (31Wandinger-Ness A. Bennett M.K. Antony C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT-29 5M12 cells were seeded on 12 100-mm filters, which were cultured up to day 10. Six filters were treated by 2 mm GalNAcα-O-bn for 18 h before the experiment. After the transfer of filters to 14-cm dishes, cells were perforated using a nitrocellulose acetate filter (HATF, 0.45-μm pore) and carrier vesicles were released by incubation in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system for 1 h at 37 °C. The carriers vesicles were then isolated from the incubation medium by flotation onto a 0.25 m sucrose cushion, pelleted, and purified on a discontinuous density gradient (1.5 m/1.2 m). The perforated cells were collected from the filters. Ultrastructural Immunochemistry—Immunolabeling was carried out on isolated carrier vesicles of HT-29 5M12 cells according to the procedure described by Scheiffele et al. (32Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, the vesicle preparation was laid on parlodion-coated nickel grids and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. Single or double labeling was performed. The grids were incubated with a first primary antibody (polyclonal anti-syntaxin-3 (1/20) or polyclonal anti-annexin XIIIb (1/40)) for one night at 4 °C in PBG buffer (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% gelatin), then with anti-rabbit Ig-coupled 18-nm gold particles (1/20) for 1 h at room temperature in PBG buffer. Subsequently, after a second fixation, grids were incubated with the second primary antibody (monoclonal anti-human DPP-IV antibody (1/20)) for 5 h at room temperature and then with anti-mouse Ig-coupled 12-nm gold particles. The grids were counterstained with 0.3% uranyl acetate and 1.8% methylcellulose. Controls grids were processed without the second primary antibodies and showed the absence of detection of 12-nm gold particles. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of Secreted Mouse DPP-IV and Endogenous Human DPP-IV—For monitoring the secretion of transfected sDPP-IV, HT-29 5M12 Cl2 cells were cultured on filters; otherwise, HT-29 5M12 cells were cultured in 6-well plates. Cells were cultured in standard conditions until day 10. Subsequently, control cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with 200 μCi/well of [35S]methionine (ICN, Irvine, CA) in 1 ml of methionine-free medium, and then chased for the indicated periods of time with 1 ml of 0.01 m methionine in regular medium. A similar protocol was applied in the presence of 2 mm GalNAcα-O-bn throughout the experiment. To follow the secretion of sDPP-IV, we collected the apical medium and we immunoprecipitated sDPP-IV with rat mAbs 1082 and 773. For analyzing the detergent extractability of cellular endogenous human DPP-IV, we used the procedure described by Alfalah et al. (14Alfalah M. Jacob R. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 277: 10683-10690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HT-29 5M12 cells were rinsed in PBS, and cells were solubilized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors for 2 h at 4 °C. The detergent extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the anti-human DPP-IV mAb HBB 3/775/42. The pellets were then solubilized in the same buffer for 20 min at 37 °C and immunoprecipitated with the anti-human DPP-IV mAb HBB 3/775/42. Immunocomplexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose-4B (Sigma), eluted in SDS sample buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol and 30% glycerol) at 60 °C for 15 min, and then analyzed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For autoradiography, gels were fixed in 40% ethanol, 10% glycerol, 10% acetic acid, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min, dried on Whatman paper, and then exposed to Hyperfilm-βmax (Amersham Biosciences). Isolation of Raft Microdomains—Rafts were isolated from series of 12 75-cm2 culture flasks of HT-29 5M12 cells according to the procedure of Fiedler et al. (33Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) slightly modified. The cell pellet equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, with 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 m sucrose, and protease inhibitors, was homogenized by 10 passages in a 1-ml tip, 15 passages in a 22-gauge needle, and 10 passages in a Dounce homogenizer. A total membrane fraction was obtained from a post-nuclear supernatant after ultracentrifugation (38,000 rpm, 20 h) in a SW41 swinging rotor at the interface (1.2 m; 0.8 m) of a discontinuous sucrose gradient, washed in TNE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl and 5 mm EDTA), treated with a mixture of TNE/Triton X-100 at 1% for 30 min on ice, and separated by ultracentrifugation (39,000 rpm, 18 h) on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.15 m; 1.1 m; 1.2 m) in a SW41 rotor. Individual fractions of 1 ml were isolated all over the gradient and examined for their protein content. For Western blotting, half of the entire volume of each fraction was used. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Western Blotting—Samples were separated on a 5–30% SDS-PAGE (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), and the detection of proteins was carried out by luminescence using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences, Aylesbury, UK). In this work, we studied the effect of GalNAcα-O-bn on the direct apical biosynthetic route using a cloned population of HT-29 cells of enterocytic phenotype (HT-29 5M12) and short exposure times to GalNAcα-O-bn. In addition to the study of endogenous transmembrane DPP-IV, which is endocytosed and recycled to the apical membrane, we studied a soluble form of murine DPP-IV, which was expected to be secreted in the medium under a polarized fashion after transfection in HT-29 5M12 cells. Indeed, after transfection of a soluble form of rat DPP-IV in MDCK cells, Weisz et al. (35Weisz O.A. Machamer C.E. Hubbard A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22282-22288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that this soluble form was predominantly secreted into the apical medium, indicating that the lumenal domain of DPP-IV was likely to contain the apical sorting information. Inhibition in the Secretion of a Soluble Murine DPP-IV Form—HT-29 5M12 cells of enterocytic phenotype were stably transfected with an eukaryotic expression vector coding for a secreted mouse DPP-IV, and we selected the clone HT-29 5M12 Cl2 that secreted DPP-IV enzymatic activity in the medium. We first investigated the secreted DPP-IV forms in the apical and basolateral medium using two-dimensional electrophoresis and protein identification by mass spectrometry of tryptic digests (Fig. 1A). Cells were cultured on filters in standard medium up to day 10 and then for 24 h in serum-free medium with or without GalNAcα-O-bn. Apical and basolateral cell culture media were collected, concentrated, and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. The amounts of cell culture media used for two-dimensional electrophoresis were normalized in reference to the same number of cells. In the apical medium of control cells, a train of 5 spots of high intensity was visualized between 80 and 90 kDa with a range of pI (isoelectric point) from 5.5 to 6 approximately. These spots were excised, digested with trypsin and analyzed for their peptidic map by MALDI-TOF. Results showed that these spots corresponded to murine DPP-IV (data not shown). The two-dimensional pattern of the basolateral medium showed that sDPP-IV was not significantly secreted into this medium. This shows that the recombinant sDPP-IV is predominantly secreted in the apical medium of HT-29 5M12 Cl2 cells and confirmed the existence of apical targeting signal(s) in the ectodomain of the molecule, and also indicated the involvement of a specific machinery for its transport toward the apical side. In the apical medium collected after GalNAcα-O-bn treatment, we visualized in the area of sDPP-IV only three spots (spots 1, 2, and 3) with lower intensity. Spots 4 and 5, corresponding to the most acidic forms, were not detected, and spot 3, which accounted for the major spot, showed a marked decrease in comparison to spots 1 and 2. sDPP-IV was not recovered in the basolateral medium of treated HT-29 5M12 cells, although a"

Rat short/branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (SBCAD) are more active toward substrates with longer carbon side chains than human SBCAD, whereas the human enzyme utilizes substrates with longer primary carbon chains. The mechanism underlying this difference in substrate specificity was investigated with a novel surface plasmon resonance assay combined with absorbance and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and kinetics analysis of wild type SBCADs and mutants with altered amino acid residues in the substrate binding pocket. Results show that a relatively few amino acid residues are critical for determining the difference in substrate specificity seen between the human and rat enzymes and that alteration of these residues influences different portions of the enzyme mechanism. Molecular modeling of the SBCAD structure suggests that position 104 at the bottom of the substrate binding pocket is important in determining the length of the primary carbon chain that can be accommodated. Conformational changes caused by alteration of residues at positions 105 and 177 directly affect the rate of electron transfer in the dehydrogenation reactions, and are likely transmitted from the bottom of the substrate binding pocket to β-sheet 3. Differences between the rat and human enzyme at positions 383, 222, and 220 alter substrate specificity without affecting substrate binding. Modeling predicts that these residues combine to determine the distance between the flavin ring of FAD and the catalytic base, without changing the opening of the substrate binding pocket.

These residues, however, are in the same position in rat and human SBCAD indicating that other amino acid residues contribute to the substrate specificity of SBCAD (22Binzak B. Willard J. Vockley J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have begun using SBCAD as a model to study the amino acid residues and motifs important in determining acyl-CoA substrate specificity. The ACD enzyme mechanism is a complicated one consisting of a reductive half-reaction leading to the production of a stable substrate-enzyme intermediate (the charge-transfer complex) that resolves to reoxidized enzyme and product through interaction with electron transferring flavoprotein (ETF) during the oxidative half-reaction (Scheme 1) (23Thorpe C. Schaller R.A. Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Stevenson K.J. Massey V. Williams C.H. The Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenases: Some Mechanistic Aspects.

The manner in which different substrates interact with ACDs is not well understood. Most frequently, the interaction between an ACD and various substrates is studied by monitoring characteristic absorbance changes at 450 and 560 nm following the addition of substrate to enzyme under anaerobic conditions. A decrease in absorbance at 450 nm is characteristic of the reduction of the essential FAD coenzyme, whereas an increase in absorbance at 560 nm is because of a new resonance signal related to the charge-transfer complex in the enzyme reaction (1Beinert H.

In some situations, however, the observed changes at these wavelengths have been multiphasic, leading to difficulty in interpretation of the results. This has been postulated to be due to excess substrate:enzyme ratios in the reaction mixture as shown in Scheme 2 (26Schopfer L.M. Massey V. Ghisla S. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6599-6611Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the change in the 560 nm maximum is reduced or absent when non-optimum substrates interact with an ACD (27Cummings J.G. Thorpe C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To circumvent some of these difficulties, we have developed a real time surface plasmon resonance (SPR) method to measure the overall binding affinity of SBCAD for its natural substrate at low substrate concentrations. In addition, the high sensitivity of SPR makes studies of interaction between ACDs and suboptimal substrates possible.Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Construction of SBCAD Prokaryotic Expression Vectors—The sequences for the mature form of wild type rat and human SBCAD cDNA (11Rozen R.

The sequence of all DNA fragments was confirmed in their entirety through automated DNA sequencing by the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Mayo Clinic. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SBCADs—Expression of the wild type and mutant SBCADs was performed as described previously (29Mohsen A.A. Vockley J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Battaile K.P. Kim J.-J. Vockley J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 57: 175Google Scholar) with minor modifications. SBCAD plasmids were transfected into E. coli strain BL21DE3 (Invitrogen). Eight-liter cultures were grown to mid-log phase in 2× YT broth at 37 °C and then induced overnight with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. SBCAD was purified from the crude cellular extract by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, fractionation with 50–65% ammonium sulfate, and chromatography on Blue-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). Purity of the SBCADs was judged by SDS-PAGE (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the purified samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Enzyme Assays—SBCAD activity was measured with the fluorometric anaerobic ETF reduction assay using an LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer Life Sciences with a heated cuvette block set to 32 °C as described (33Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3922-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Vockley J. Mohsen A.W. Binzak B. Willard J. Fauq A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 241-258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isobutyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA were purchased from Sigma. (S)-2-Methylbutyryl-CoA was synthesized as described previously (22Binzak B. Willard J. Vockley J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1382: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The protein concentration in the reaction mixture was adjusted to give a linear reaction. One milliunit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme necessary to completely reduce 1 nmol of ETF in 1 min. For kinetic analysis, ETF concentration was 1 μm, and substrate concentration was varied as described in the text. K m and V max values were calculated with the Enzyme Kinetics version 1.4.1 software (Trinity Software, Campton, NH) using a Macintosh personal computer and fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression analysis. The K m value measured here could reflect the overall substrate binding affinity only if the oxidative half-reaction was much faster than the reductive half-reaction (Scheme 1). Anaerobic Titration of Wild Type and Mutant SBCADs with Substrate—Wild type and mutant enzymes were titrated with (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA or hexanoyl-CoA as described previously (20Battaile K. Mohsen A.-W. Vockley J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15356-15363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Mohsen A.-W.A. Vockley J.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7720-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Spectral scans were performed using a Beckman DU7400 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a computer. Briefly, 8 μm enzyme sample diluted in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 2 μm pyocynanine (as an indicator dye) was placed in a quartz cuvette at room temperature (35Pellett J.D. Becker D.F. Saenger A.K. Fuchs J.A. Stankovich M.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7720-7728Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cuvette was sealed with a rubber stopper and, using a needle, 10 alternating cycles of vacuum and argon were applied to remove molecular oxygen. Glucose oxidase and catalase were then added as for the ETF reduction assay to remove residual oxygen. Substrate was added in sequential aliquots using a 50-μl Hamilton syringe attached to an automatic dispenser. Concentrations varied as indicated in the text. CD Assay of Charge-Transfer Complexes—CD spectra were recorded in a 10-mm path length cuvette at 4 °C on a Jasco J-720 (Easton, MD) (36Peyser Y.M. Ajtai K. Werber M.M. Burghardt T.P. Muhlrad A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Strickland E.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1974; 2: 113-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Enzyme was diluted in a quartz cuvette to a concentration of 5–15 μm in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol; molecular oxygen was removed as above, and the CD spectrum was measured from 250 to 700 nm. A saturating concentration of anaerobic substrate ((S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA or hexanoyl-CoA; 133–520 μm) was then added, and the CD spectrum was again measured. An average spectrum from five scans was utilized for further calculations. The buffer and free substrate have minimal CD signal. They were measured separately and subtracted from each CD spectra of the SBCADs. Ellipticity (millidegree) was measured at each wavelength {Θ}obs and expressed as the mean residue molar ellipticity {Θ} (deg·cm2·dmol-1), defined as {Θ} = Θobs × MRW/(10 lc), where Θobs is the observed ellipticity in degrees; c is the protein concentration in g/ml, and l is the length of light path in centimeters. MRW is a mean residue molecular weight of 108. Molecular Modeling—Computer modeling of wild type and mutant SBCADs was performed using a Silicon Graphic 02 work station (Mountain View, CA) and the Insight II 2000 software package (BIOSYM Technologies/Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA), as described previously (38Mohsen A.W.A. Navarette B. Vockley J. Mol. Genet. Metabol. 2001; 73: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amino acid sequence alignment of porcine MCAD, human IVD, and rat butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was optimized for structural modeling over a continuous set of overlapping stretches. Regions of structural homology were identified, and coordinates of the areas of conservation were mapped onto the amino acid sequence of SBCAD and energy-minimized the structure using the homology module of the Insight II software. Real Time Surface Plasmon Resonance—Real time surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed on a BIAcore ™ 3000 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Plasmodium falciparum acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP, generously provided by Dr. Terry Smith, Dundee, Scotland, UK) was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21DE3, using vector pET 16b-Plasmodium falciparum (PfACBP), and was purified to greater than 95% purity as judged by SDS-electrophoresis as described (39van Aalten D.M.F. Milne K.G. Zou J.Y. Kleywegt G.J. Bergfors T. Ferguson M.A.J. Knudsen J. Jones T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). ACBP was then directly coupled to a carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip, Biacore AB) through primary amine groups with a 1:1 mixture of N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (BIAcore AB). The running buffer during the immobilization step was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 (Biacore AB), 5% glycerol. All subsequent experiments were performed at 4 °C with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% (v/v), Tween 20 (Bio-Rad), 5% glycerol as running buffer at a constant flow rate of 10 μl/min. Affinity of SBCAD for substrate was determined using a solution competition technique. ACBP was immobilized to maximum density (∼8,000 response units), and various concentrations of (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA or hexanoyl-CoA were first flowed over the surface to measure the K D between ACBP and the substrate. A concentration series of substrate near and below the K D value was then flowed across the ACBP-immobilized sensor chip, and the SPR signal was measured. A calibration curve between the concentration of substrate and its SPR responses at a certain time point was created. A substrate concentration near its K D value for ACBP was chosen and kept constant and then was mixed with a concentration series of SBCAD. The enzyme/substrate mixture was pre-incubated at 4 °C for 30 min before it was flowed over the ACBP sensor chip. The free substrate in the substrate/enzyme mixture bound ACBP on the sensor chip surface, and its SPR response was measured. An unreacted carboxymethylated dextran matrix was used as a reference surface to allow subtraction of the bulk refractive index from the signal of each sample. The nonspecific binding of SBCADs to the active surface was minimal and was measured separately and then subtracted from the measured substrate SPR signal. The concentration of free substrate in the substrate/enzyme mixture was then interpolated from the calibration curve and plotted against the concentration of SBCAD. The curves were fit with the solution competition affinity equation using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software (BIAcore AB): y = 0.5(a - x - K D) + (0.25 (x + a + K D)2 - ax)0.5, where a is the initial substrate concentration, which was kept constant; K D is the overall binding constant between substrate and SBCAD in the solution; y is the concentration of free substrate in the mixture, and x is the concentration of total enzyme in solution. The IC50 was then obtained from the curve, and K D was calculated (40Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 41Karlsson R. Magnusson M.K.

Biochem. 1996; 234: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The ACBP sensor chip surface was regenerated by washing 5–10 min with the running buffer. Western Blotting—10–100-ng samples of wild type and mutant SBCAD proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to Western polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a TE Series Transphore Electrophoresis Unit (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). SBCAD protein was detected by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-SBCAD antibody, followed by a 1:3000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and visualization with an nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color development solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad) as described previously (12Willard J. Vicanek C. Battaile K.P. Vanveldhoven P.P. Fauq A.H. Rozen R. Vockley J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In Vitro Mutagenesis—To explore the structural basis for the differential utilization of substrate by human and rat SBCAD, a structural model of SBCAD was generated based on its homology to the ACDs for which x-ray crystal data are available. The modeling identified 10 amino acids in or near the substrate binding pocket that differ between the rat and human enzymes and thus are candidates to be important residues in modifying substrate specificity (Fig. 1). To characterize the role of these residues in determining substrate specificity, in vitro mutagenesis was used to systematically change each residue in the human enzyme to its rat counterpart in various combinations. The mutant enzymes were then overexpressed in an E. coli system, and the activity in crude cellular extracts made from the induced cultures was measured with various short and branched chain substrates using the anaerobic fluorescent ETF reduction assay. The specific activities of crude cellular extracts from cells expressing the mutant enzymes as measured with (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA as substrate are shown in Table I along with the ratio of the specific activities measured with isobutyryl-CoA and hexanoyl-CoA relative to (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA. Extracts containing the rat and human enzymes had nearly equal specific activities when (S)-2-methylbutyryl-CoA was used as substrate. The human enzyme was more active than the rat enzyme toward hexanoyl-CoA, whereas this pattern was reversed for isobutyryl-CoA. Substitution of all 10 or 7 of 10 residues in the human enzyme with their rat counterparts (M10 and M7 mutants, respectively) led to a dramatic reduction in the ability of"

MMTV-cyclin D1 transgenic mice develop mainly adenocarcinoma, while MMTV-cyclin D2 mice show a lack of alveologenesis during pregnancy and only develop carcinoma at low frequency. The effect of cyclin D3 overexpression in mammary glands remains hitherto unknown. We generated MMTV-cyclin D3 transgenic mice and report here that they develop exclusively squamous cell carcinoma. We show that although cyclin D3 transgene expression was detected early in puberty, postnatal development and mammary gland proliferation were normal in virgin animals. In contrast, multiparous mice develop multiple foci of abnormal growth that correspond to various stages of squamous metaplasia. Therefore, our results support a role for cyclin D3 in squamous differentiation. In addition, we found that p16 expression during involution is abolished, while p27 expression increased in MMTV-cyclin D3 mice, two modifications that have been reported in the other MMTV-D-type cyclin transgenic models. Our observations indicate that despite biochemical redundancy in vitro and in vivo, D-type cyclins promote distinct oncogenic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2007063723,"The CDKN2A gene, which encodes the proteins p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF), is located on chromosome 9p21. Germline mutations at this locus increase susceptibility to cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM). In general, missense and nonsense mutations are primarily responsible for defective p16(INK4a) and possibly p14(ARF) protein function and account for approximately 20% of inherited CMM cases. We report a G>T transversion mutation in the last nucleotide of exon 2, affecting the aspartic acid residue at position 153 of CDKN2A-p16(INK4a) in a proband with melanoma. If splicing were unaffected, this mutation would change Asp to Tyr. RT-PCR analysis, however, revealed that this mutation, which we have termed D153spl(c.457G>T), and a previously described mutation at the next nucleotide, IVS2+1G>T, result in identical aberrant splicing affecting both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). The two main alternate splice products for each of the two normal transcripts includes a 74 bp deletion in exon 2, revealing a cryptic splice site, and the complete skipping of exon 2. The dual inactivation of p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF) may contribute to the CMM in these families."

This unresponsiveness is associated with the constitutive activation of the small G protein, Rap1, and the lack of Ras-dependent activation of ERK. Recent studies suggest that Rap1 can activate the MAP kinase kinase kinase B-Raf that is either endogenously or ectopically expressed. Peripheral T cells generally do not express B-Raf; therefore, to test the hypothesis that ectopic expression of B-Raf could permit Rap1 to activate ERK signaling, we generated transgenic mice expressing B-Raf within peripheral T cells. This converted Rap1 into an activator of ERK, to enhance ERK activation and proliferation following TCR engagement in the absence of costimulation. When T cells were incubated with engineered APCs presenting antigen on I-Ek and expressing low levels of B7, they became anergic, displayed constitutive activation of Rap1, and were deficient in Ras and ERK activation. However, when incubated with the same APCs, T cells expressing the B-Raf transgene proliferated upon restimulation and displayed elevated ERK activation.

One potential mechanism of ERK regulation is the modulation of Ras signaling by the small G protein, Rap1. Rap1, a member of the Ras super-family, was identified as an antagonist of Ras dependent transformation in fibroblasts (4Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 8740-8747Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rap1 is inhibited by the engagement of the CD28 costimulatory receptor (10Reedquist K.A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4944-4949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 12Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1001-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the functions of Rap1 activation may be to limit ERK activation in the absence of costimulation (5Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Schmitt J.M. Baird A.M. Holdorf A.D. Straus D.B. Shaw A.S. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8409-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Indeed, in models of T cell anergy elicited by stimulation through the TCR alone, Rap1 is constitutively active and may limit signaling downstream of Ras (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Recently other functions of Rap1 have been identified, particularly the enhancement of T cell adhesion (14de Bruyn K.M. Rangarajan S. Reedquist K.A. Figdor C.G. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29468-29476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Rap1 can regulate anergy independently of its actions on ERKs. To address this question, we selectively inhibited Rap1 antagonism of ERKs by introducing B-Raf, a non-lymphoid Rap1 effector, into T lymphocytes, and examined the consequence of this change on Rap1 signaling and the development of anergy. B-Raf, unlike Raf-1, is activated by Rap1, and when activated can activate ERK via the ERK kinase, MEK (16Ohtsuka T. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Kuroda S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1258-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S.

Nature. 1998; 392: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that Rap1 activates B-Raf by recruiting B-Raf to the membrane. This recruitment of B-Raf by either Rap1 or Ras results in B-Raf activation. The requirements for Raf-1 activation are more stringent. In addition to recruitment to the membrane, additional phosphorylations are required that occur upon recruitment of Raf-1 to Ras. These phosphorylations of Raf-1 do not occur upon recruitment of Raf-1 to Rap1 (19Carey K.D. Watson D.E. Pessin J.E. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For this reason, Rap1 activity results in ERK activation when B-Raf is expressed, but may prevent Raf-1 activation by sequestering Raf-1 without activating it. Transfection of B-Raf into non-lymphoid cells that do not normally express this Raf isoform has been proposed to allow Rap1 to couple to ERK (17Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S.

Since T cells do not generally express B-Raf, we tested the hypothesis that the transgenic expression of B-Raf in peripheral T cells might have a similar action. Recent studies examining the role of ERK inhibition in T cell anergy have utilized constitutively active or interfering mutants of upstream activators of ERKs (22Crespi D. Massa S. Basso V. Colombetti S. Mueller D.L. Mondino A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 2500-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) as well as the pharmacological inhibition of the ERK kinase MEK (23DeSilva D.R. Jones E.A. Favata M.F. Jaffee B.D. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Scherle P.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4175-4181PubMed Google Scholar). These manipulations result in the activation or inhibition of ERK without mirroring physiological levels of regulation (24Faris M. Kokot N. Lee L. Nel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27366-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Izquierdo M. Bowden S. Cantrell D. J. Exp.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4549-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). By introducing B-Raf into T cells, we hoped to test the hypothesis that B-Raf expression can permit Rap1 to couple positively to ERKs. By selectively enhancing ERK signaling through Rap1 without altering ERK activation through Ras, ectopic B-Raf expression in T cells might provide the opportunity to examine the consequence of enhancing ERK selectively in the absence of costimulation. We show that B-Raf expression in T cells converted Rap1 into an activator of ERKs. Additionally, B-Raf-expressing T cells proliferated in the absence of costimulation. Moreover, these cells could not be anergized by APCs expressing low levels of B7, which were deficient in providing costimulation. Wild-type and B-Raf-expressing cells stimulated with APCs expressing low levels of B7 were characterized by constitutive Rap1 activation and lack of Ras activation. The only detectable biochemical difference between B-Raf-expressing cells and wild-type cells from B-Raf negative littermates was elevated ERK activity, suggesting that elevated ERK activation could prevent anergy in this setting. Cell Lines and Transfections—Cells from the human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat (clone E6–1, from A.T.C.C., Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, NJ) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For transient transfections, 5 × 107 Jurkat T cells were transfected by electroporation (250 V/950 μF) with 10 μg of RapV12 (constitutively active Rap1) and 10 μg of Raf-1 or 10 μg of B-Raf plasmids. All cells were transfected with the reporter constructs, Gal4-Elk1and 5xGal4-E1b/luciferase (3 μg each) and activity was measured by luciferase assay as previously described (17Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The total DNA transfected was made constant with the addition of pcDNA3 (vector). After transfection, cells recovered for 24 h in media. Ltk- fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC and displayed a broad range of endogenous B7.1 (CD80) and no detectable B7.2 (CD86) expression. To generate B7hi and B7lo fibroblasts, Ltk- cells were stained with anti-CD80 FITC (16–10A1, BD PharMingen), sorted on a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen) and cloned at limiting dilution. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate (100 mg/ml), 5 × 10-5m β-mercaptoethanol, essential and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Fibroblasts were transfected with a plasmid encoding an MCC:I-Ek chimera (27Wetzel S.A. McKeithan T.W. Parker D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6092-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The MCC:I-Ek chimera used for the B7lo line included the GyrB domains attached to the cytoplasmic tail, while that used for the B7hi line included green fluorescent protein. These cytoplasmic domains do not affect presentation of the peptide complex on the surface of the APCs to T cells (27Wetzel S.A. McKeithan T.W. Parker D.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6092-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and data not shown. Transfectants were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 active drug, and drugresistant cells were screened for I-Ek surface expression by flow cytometry and cloned by limiting dilution. Transgenic Mice—The cDNA encoding B-Raf was inserted into a unique XhoI site downstream of the CD4 promoter under control of a T cell-specific enhancer element with the cis-acting silencer element deleted (28Sawada S. Scarborough J.D. Killeen N. Lipmann D.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 917-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) (gift from Paul Allen, Washington University). This construct was used to generate transgenic mouse lines in C57BL6/J mice by standard procedures. Potential founders were genotyped using both tail and ear DNA by Southern blot using random-primed probes derived from the full-length cDNA and by PCR analysis using vector specific primers. The founders that were identified by these methods were mated with wild-type C57BL6/J mice and F1 litters genotyped by PCR. Three lines were established and shown to have the same phenotype. One B-Raf-expressing line was chosen to cross to the AD10 TCR transgenic line. Experiments were performed on adult mice, except for thymocyte staining which was performed on thymocytes from 3-week-old mice. For anergy experiments B-Raf transgenic animals were crossed with the TCR transgenic mouse line, AD10 (29Kaye J. Vasquez N.J. Hedrick S.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3342-3353PubMed Google Scholar). T cells from the AD10 TCR transgenic mice express a recombined TCR, which recognizes pigeon cytochrome c (PCC) peptide (amino acids 88–104) or moth cytochrome c (MCC) peptide (amino acids 88–103) presented by MHC class II I-Ek. B-Raf transgenic mice were also crossed with the TCR transgenic mouse line, AND, which also recognizes the PCC and MCC peptides presented by I-Ek (29Kaye J. Vasquez N.J. Hedrick S.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3342-3353PubMed Google Scholar). In all animal studies, experiments were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional guidelines and were approved by the IACUC. Flow Cytometry—The surface expression of CD8 and CD4 molecules on thymocytes was analyzed by direct staining with FITC-labeled anti-CD8 mAb (53–6.7, BD PharMingen) and Cy-Chrome-labeled anti-CD4 mAb (RM4-5, BD PharMingen). CD69 expression was analyzed on CD4+, Vα11+, Vβ3+T cells. Cells were stained with Cy-Chrome-labeled anti-CD4 mAb, PE-labeled anti-Vα11 mAb (RR8-1, BD PharMingen), FITC-labeled anti-Vβ3 mAb (KJ25, BD PharMingen) and biotinylated anti-CD69 mAb (H1.2F3, BD PharMingen) followed by streptavidin APC (BD PharMingen). Intracellular staining for B-Raf expression was performed following fixation and permeabilization with anti-B-Raf antibody (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology Inc.) followed by Cy5-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA). Surface expression of B7.1, B7.2, and I-Ek was determined by surface staining of fibroblasts with FITC-labeled anti-CD80, PE-labeled anti-CD86 (GL1, BD PharMingen) and D-4 mAb, which recognizes I-Ek:MCC (30Reay P.A. Matsui K. Haase K. Wulfing C. Chien Y.H. Davis M.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5626-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), followed by PE-labeled anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotechnology Inc.). The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur. Viable cells were gated using forward and side scatter. Primary T Cell Isolation and Stimulation—CD4+ T cells from the spleen or lymph nodes were purified by negative selection with monoclonal antibodies using SpinSep (17031, Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten million purified T cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (clone 145-2C11, BD PharMingen) and/or 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (clone 37.51, BD PharMingen) at 4 °C for 30 min, washed, then stimulated with the addition of 10 μg/ml of goat anti-hamster immunoglobulin (Southern Biotechnology Assoc. Inc.) for 5 min at 37 °C. T Cell Anergy—The two protocols for the induction of anergy used were modified from the methods of Paul Allen and co-workers (31Sloan-Lancaster J. Evavold B.D. Allen P.M. Nature. 1993; 363: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) and Ronald Schwartz and co-workers (32Jenkins M.K. Chen C.A. Jung G. Mueller D.L. Schwartz R.H. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). T cell blasts were generated from AD10 TCR transgenic and AD10xB-Raf mice by culturing splenocytes for 4–6 days with 2.5 μm PCC peptide in T cell media (RPMI 1640) containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate (100 mg/ml), 5 × 10-5m β-mercaptoethanol, essential and non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin). To initiate anergy via exposure to B7 low APCs, viable cells were recovered over a density gradient (Lympholyte M, Cedarlane, Hornby, Ontario) and 5 × 106 cells/ml were incubated with equal numbers of B7hi or B7lo expressing fibroblasts for 24 h. T cells were separated from fibroblasts by density gradient centrifugation and subsequent culture for 1 h on plates to remove any remaining adherent cells. T cells were then recovered and rested for 4–6 days prior to experimental use. To initiate anergy via antibody stimulation, viable cells were recovered over a density gradient and 5 × 106cells/ml were incubated overnight with plate bound anti-TCRβ antibody (10 μg/ml, H57-957, BD PharMingen) or isotype control. T cells were removed from the plates and rested for 24 h prior to experimental use. For experiments using PD98059 (Sigma), the drug was applied at 20 μm during the initial 24-h incubation with fibroblast APCs. Raf-1 and B-Raf Kinase Assays—T cell blasts were generated from wild-type and B-Raf transgenic mice by culturing splenocytes for 4–6 days with 0.25 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody (clone 145-2C11) in T cell media (as described above). Clones were then rested 24 h prior to use in kinase assays. B-Raf and Raf-1 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 1000 μg of cell lysate with anti Raf-1 (E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-B-Raf antibody (C19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) coupled to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. Kinase assays were performed as previously described (19Carey K.D. Watson D.E. Pessin J.E. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3185-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In Vivo Rap1 and Ras Activation Assays—This assay was performed as previously described (5Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Schmitt J.M. Baird A.M. Holdorf A.D. Straus D.B. Shaw A.S. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8409-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Isolated T cells were stimulated as described above and lysed in ice-cold Rap1 lysis buffer with inhibitors, and the protein content of lysates determined by BioRad assay. 300 μg of total cell lysate was incubated with 40 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Ral-GDS-Ras binding domain (RBD) fusion protein (gift of J. L. Bos, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands) coupled to glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C to recover activated Rap1 (Rap-GTP). Beads were pelleted and washed and the protein eluted from the beads by boiling in Laemmli buffer. Activated Ras (Ras-GTP) was isolated from cell lysates using agarose-coupled GST fused to the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 (GST-Raf-RBD) provided in a Ras activation kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot (see below). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Control and anti-TCR-treated T cells (2.5 × 106/ml) were rested for 48 h, then restimulated at 37 °C for 3 h in 6-well plates coated with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 mAbs. Cells were then collected and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in cytosolic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation, washed once in cytosolic buffer, then lysed in hypertonic buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove the insoluble fraction. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot (see below). Western Blot—Cells were lysed in ice-cold Rap1 lysis buffer with inhibitors and the protein content of lysates determined by BioRad assay as described above (5Carey K.D. Dillon T.J. Schmitt J.M. Baird A.M. Holdorf A.D. Straus D.B. Shaw A.S. Stork P.J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8409-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated in a 10–12% gel, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin and probed with either anti-Rap1 polyclonal antibody (Rap1 (121), Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) or anti-Ras mAb (clone 10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminesence. Phosphorylation of ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, and JNK2 were detected from 30 μg of total cell lysate by immunoblotting with phosophospecific MAP kinase polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and total ERKs and JNKs were detected by immunoblotting with anti-ERK and anti-JNK polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Levels of c-Fos were detected from 4 μg of total nuclear proteins by Western blot using anti-c-Fos antibody (H-125, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CD69 Expression—Anergic and non-anergic AD10 and AD10xB-Raf T cells (106 cells/ml) were stimulated with 2 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 10 μg/ml anti-CD28 plate bound Abs (BD PharMingen) for 18 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested on ice and stained for CD69 expression with biotinylated anti-CD69 mAb (H1.2F3, BD PharMingen) followed by streptavidin APC (see “Flow Cytometry”). T Cell Proliferation Assay—Naïve splenocytes at a concentration of 106 cells/ml were added to 96-well plates (100 μl) in the presence of a range of concentrations of anti-CD3 antibody. Alternatively, purified naïve T cells at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/ml were added to 96-well plates with varying concentrations of B7hi or B7lo fibroblasts. Purified AD10 and AD10xB-Raf T cells that were rested following anergy induction (5 × 105 cells/ml) were added to 96-well plates with 2 × 106 cells/ml irradiated B10.BR splenocytes in the presence of varying concentrations of PCC peptide. Assays were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well for the final 16–18 h of culture. The plates were harvested using a Packard 96-well Filtermate Harvester and counted on a Packard Top Count Scintillation counter. Expression of B-Raf but Not Raf-1 Allows Rap1 to Activate Elk-1—It has been proposed that Rap1 is a potent activator of ERKs in B-Raf-expressing cells (8Schmidt M. Goebeler M. Posern G. Feller S.M.

To test whether a constitutively active mutant of Rap1 (RapV12), could augment ERK signaling in T cells-transfected with B-Raf, we used a transcription-coupled assay monitoring the ERK-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 (17Vossler M. Yao H. York R. Rim C. Pan M.-G. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 33Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The data show that neither B-Raf nor RapV12 activated Elk-1 when transfected alone. However, when transfected together, B-Raf and RapV12 co-operated to activate Elk-1-dependent transcription. This action of B-Raf was specific for this isoform of the Raf family kinases, as co-transfection of Raf-1 with RapV12 did not enhance Elk-1 activity (Fig. 1A). The B-Raf Transgene Is Expressed in Transgenic but Not Wild-type Murine T Cells—To examine the role of ERKs in regulating T cell proliferative responses, we generated transgenic mice expressing the 95-kDa isoform of B-Raf under a modified CD4 promoter (34Sawada S. Littman D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5506-5515Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the thymus and lymph nodes of B-Raf transgenic mice, a 95-kDa band, representing the expressed B-Raf protein, was seen in Western blots, in contrast to wild-type animals, which showed no expression of B-Raf (Fig. 1B). B-Raf was also expressed within splenic T cells (data not shown). Intracellular B-Raf staining was identified in CD4/CD8 double negative (DN), double positive (DP), CD4+/CD8-, and CD4-/CD8+ T cells from the B-Raf-transgenic, but not in the wild-type mice (Fig. 1C). To examine if the introduction of B-Raf had an effect on T cell development, we examined thymocyte development in AD10 TCR transgenic and AD10xB-Raf animals by examining CD4 and CD8 expression. The AD10 TCR is specific for pigeon or moth cytochrome c (PCC or MCC) presented on I-Ek. No differences were seen in positive selection of T cells into the CD4 compartment (Fig. 1D). Similarly, there were no differences in thymocyte development when B-Raf-expressing mice were crossed with AND TCR transgenic mice (Fig. 1D), whose TCR shares specificity with the AD10 TCR. Transgenic Expression of B-Raf Enhances the Proliferation and ERK Activation of T Cells in a Costimulation-independent Manner—To evaluate the functional consequences of B-Raf expression in T cells, we tested the proliferative capacity of splenocytes following CD3 stimulation by cross-linking antibodies. B-Raf-expressing T cells showed an increased proliferation rate following CD3 stimulation compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). Rap1 is activated by TCR stimulation (5Carey K.D. Dillon T.J.

Although cell surface glyconjugates are highly complex and diverse in structure, it is now apparent that specific glycans are responsible for mediating discrete molecular recognition events among cells. These unique carbohydrate epitopes are a reflection of the biosynthetic machinery within the secretory compartments of the cell. Therein, carbohydrate biosynthetic and processing enzymes, organized among the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used in this paper are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BFA, brefeldin A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CGN, cis-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Core1-β3GlcNAcT, Core 1 GlcNAc transferase; Core2GlcNAcT-I, Core 2 GlcNAc transferase I; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FucTVII, fucosyltransferase VII; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GlcNAc6ST, GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase; GlcNAcT-I, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; HEV, high endothelial venule; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MTOC, microtubule organizing center; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sLex, sialyl Lewis x; TGN, trans-Golgi network.1The abbreviations used in this paper are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; BFA, brefeldin A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CGN, cis-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Core1-β3GlcNAcT, Core 1 GlcNAc transferase; Core2GlcNAcT-I, Core 2 GlcNAc transferase I; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FucTVII, fucosyltransferase VII; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GlcNAc6ST, GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferase; GlcNAcT-I, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I; HEV, high endothelial venule; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MTOC, microtubule organizing center; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; sLex, sialyl Lewis x; TGN, trans-Golgi network. and Golgi cisternae, act in an assembly line to generate functional oligosaccharide structures (5Gleeson P.A.

The organization of these enzymes within subcellular compartments can be a key determinant of cell surface glycosylation patterns and, accordingly, cell-cell interactions. The leukocyte adhesion molecule L-selectin mediates the interaction of lymphocytes with endothelial cells of peripheral lymph node high endothelial venules (HEV), a crucial step during constitutive lymphocyte recirculation through lymph nodes (7Rosen S.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A similar process occurs at sites of chronic inflammation, during which many classes of leukocytes extravasate into the diseased tissue. In both cases, L-selectin binds to unique sulfated and fucosylated carbohydrates (depicted in Fig. 1A and termed “sulfoadhesin” herein) that are presented on O-glycosylated, mucin-like endothelial glycoproteins such as CD34 and GlyCAM-1 (7Rosen S.D.

Today. 2001; 6: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Elements of the sulfoadhesin structure have been elucidated during the past decade, beginning with the identification of the 6-sulfo-sialyl Lewis x (sLex) capping group as a major determinant of L-selectin binding (10Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This capping group can be displayed on a Core 2 branch (Fig. 1A), initiated by an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue added by the Core 2 GlcNAc transferase (Core2GlcNAcT-I) (13Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the simplest case, this GlcNAc residue is sulfated at the 6-position and elaborated into the sLex epitope. However, there exist higher order structures containing multiple N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc, Galβ1-4GlcNAc) repeats, which may contain additional sulfate groups and/or fucose residues (10Hemmerich S.

A second major feature of sulfoadhesin was recently elucidated as the antigen for the MECA-79 antibody (11Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). This antibody was originally characterized by its specific binding to peripheral lymph node HEV and HEV-like vessels in chronically inflamed tissues and its ability to block L-selectin-mediated leukocyte adhesion (14Streeter P.R. Rouse B.T. Butcher E.C. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 15Michie S.A. Streeter P.R. Bolt P.A. Butcher E.C. Picker L.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1688-1698PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of MECA-79-reactive mucin-type glycoproteins revealed a novel Core 1 extension (Fig. 1A) initiated by a recently discovered GlcNAc transferase (Core1-β3GlcNAcT) (11Yeh J.C. Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Ellies L.G. Rabuka D. Hindsgaul O. Marth J.D. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Cell. 2001; 105: 957-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As with the Core 2 branch, this Core 1 GlcNAc residue can be elaborated directly into 6-sulfo-sLex or extended with LacNAc repeats. Sulfation of GlcNAc within sulfoadhesin is essential for functional L-selectin binding activity (9Imai Y. Lasky L. Rosen S. Nature. 1993; 361: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 16Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This discovery has directed considerable attention to sulfation as a modulator of chronic inflammation and to its biosynthetic origin. A family of Golgi resident GlcNAc-6-sulfotransferases (GlcNAc6ST-0, -1, -2, -3, -4, and -5) has now been identified, and their endogenous substrates and biological functions are under intense scrutiny (17Hemmerich S. Lee J.K. Bhakta S. Bistrup A. Ruddle N.R. Rosen S.D. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 75-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Grunwell J.R. Rath V.L. Rasmussen J. Cabrilo Z. Bertozzi C.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15590-15600Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). GlcNAc6ST-2 is a likely candidate for sulfoadhesin biosynthesis because of its highly restricted expression in HEV (16Hiraoka N. Petryniak B. Nakayama J. Tsuboi S. Suzuki M. Yeh J.C. Izawa D. Tanaka T. Miyasaka M. Lowe J.B. Fukuda M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 79-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Bistrup A. Bhakta S. Lee J.K. Belov Y.Y. Gunn M.D. Zuo F. Huang C. Kannagi R. Rosen S.D. Hemmerich S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 899-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). GlcNAc6ST-1, by contrast, is expressed in many tissues (including HEV) where it presumably sulfates GlcNAc residues within other glycan structures (20Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22577-22583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, this enzyme can generate 6-sulfo-sLex oligosaccharides in cultured cells (20Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22577-22583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The other GlcNAc6STs are also expressed in tissues lacking sulfoadhesin, such as the intestine (GlcNAc6ST-3) and cornea (GlcNAc6ST-5) (21Akama T.O. Nakayama J. Nishida K. Hiraoka N. Suzuki M. McAuliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16271-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for GlcNAc6ST-2 in sulfoadhesin biosynthesis, mice deficient in this enzyme lack MECA-79 reactivity on the luminal aspect of peripheral lymph node HEV and display significantly reduced lymphocyte homing (22Hemmerich S. Bistrup A. Singer M.S. van Zante A. Lee J.K. Tsay D. Peters M. Carminati J.L. Brennan T.J. Carver-Moore K. Leviten M. Fuentes M.E. Ruddle N.H. Rosen S.D. Immunity. 2001; 15: 237-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). No other defects are evident. However, some residual MECA-79 reactivity is observed on the abluminal aspect of peripheral lymph node high endothelial cells in GlcNAc6ST-2 knockout mice. Although GlcNAc 6-sulfate is found in ubiquitous structures such as keratan sulfate and in other N- and O-linked glycoproteins (23Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Kamerling J.P. Rijkse I. Maas A.A. van Kuik J.A. Vliegenthart J.F.

Biochem. 1992; 209: 883-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), its residence within sulfoadhesin is unique to activated endothelium where GlcNAc6ST-2 is expressed (27Hemmerich S. Butcher E.C. Rosen S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11225-11233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Thus, the other GlcNAc6STs, expressed in extralymphoid sites, presumably sulfate GlcNAc residues within different glycoconjugate structures. This substrate specificity, key to understanding how inflammatory leukocyte adhesion is regulated, may be engendered by a combination of factors. For example, each enzyme may have a preferred local context for the target GlcNAc residue, or the underlying polypeptide may contribute to a composite epitope that directs sulfation by an individual enzyme. To address these possibilities, several groups have studied the in vitro activities of recombinant soluble GlcNAc6STs using defined oligosaccharide substrates (29Seko A. Nagata K. Yonezawa S. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Uchimura K. El-Fasakhany F.M. Hori M. Hemmerich S. Blink S.E. Kansas G.S. Kanamori A. Kumamoto K. Kannagi R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5382-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The surprising conclusion from these studies is that all members of the family prefer a terminal GlcNAc residue, adding sulfate before elaboration to higher order, more specific structures. Moreover, the enzymes are relatively insensitive to the underlying glycan structures. Thus, the specificity of GlcNAc6ST-2 for sulfoadhesin, and the other sulfotransferases for their substrates, must be engendered by factors not reflected in these in vitro biochemical studies. Subcellular and subcompartmental localization play important roles in defining the substrate preference of many enzyme families (32Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 33Klingbeil C.K. Hauck C.R. Hsia D.A. Jones K.C. Reider S.R. Schlaepfer D.D. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Indeed, localization of glycosyltransferases to particular Golgi cisternae can dictate biosynthetic pathways by providing access to substrates in a prescribed order (35Osman N. McKenzie I.F.C. Mouhtouris E. Sandrin M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33105-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Skrincosky D. Kain R. El-Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22695-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that the organization of GlcNAc6STs, specifically GlcNAc6ST-1, -2, and -3, within the Golgi compartment might dictate their biological substrates. Herein we report that these three enzymes have distinct sub-Golgi localization, including a presence in the earliest part of the secretory pathway for GlcNAc6ST-2 and -3. We also show that localization affects their substrate preference and that perturbations to their localization domains can lead to a change in substrate profile. A model is proposed that correlates the distribution of GlcNAc6ST-2 in the Golgi with the process of sulfoadhesin biosynthesis. Cell Manipulations—CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the ATCC and grown in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All transfections were carried out in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) under the manufacturer's standard conditions. Plasmids and Antibodies—The plasmids containing the human sulfotransferase cDNAs, Core2GlcNAcT-I, GlyCAM-1 fused to the heavy chain of human IgG1, and fucosyltransferase VII (FucTVII) were obtained from Drs. Steven Rosen and Stefan Hemmerich. The plasmid encoding TGN38 fused to the heavy chain of human IgG was a gift from Dr. Hsiao-Ping Moore. Mouse anti-BiP mAb was purchased from Stressgen, and mouse anti-GM130 mAb was purchased from Pharmingen. The mAb G72 was a gift from Dr. Reiji Kannagi. Polyclonal rabbit serum against mannosidase II was a generous gift from Dr. Marilyn Farquhar. The anti-human ERGIC-53 monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Hans-Peter Hauri. MECA-79 and biotinylated goat anti-rat IgM were purchased from Pharmingen. Biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgM and streptavidin tricolor were purchased from Caltag. Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-human IgG was obtained from Protos Immunoresearch. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 or Alexa 647, goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 647, and rabbit anti-GFP antisera were purchased from Molecular Probes. Generation of Sulfotransferase GFP, EYFP, and ECFP Fusions and the GlcNAc6ST-1/2 Chimera—The open reading frames for GlcNAc6ST-2 and -3 were amplified by PCR and ligated into pEYFP-N1 (Clontech). The open reading frame for GlcNAc6ST-1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP TOPO (Invitrogen). GlcNAc6ST-1-ECFP was generated by inserting the reading frame of GlcNAc6ST-1 into pECFP-N1 (Clontech) followed by excision of the GlcNAc6ST-1-ECFP fusion using the NotI site located after the stop codon in ECFP. This fragment was then ligated into pIRES puro2 (Clontech). The GlcNAc6ST-1/2 chimera was generated using a megaprimer PCR method adapted from Skrincosky et al. (36Skrincosky D. Kain R. El-Battari A. Exner M. Kerjaschki D. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22695-22702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, the N-terminal region of GlcNAc6ST-1 containing the appropriate localization domain was amplified by PCR using a 3′-primer that contained 21 bp of 5′-nonannealing sequence corresponding to the first seven codons of the N-terminal portion of the GlcNAc6ST-2 catalytic domain. The amplified fragment was gel purified and then used as a 5′-primer along with a 3′-primer appropriate for amplifying GlcNAc6ST-2′s catalytic domain. The amplified fragment contained the gene corresponding to the full-length chimeric protein that was then ligated into pEYFP-N1. The final gene encoded a chimeric protein containing residues 1-114 of GlcNAc6ST-1 and 41-387 of GlcNAc6ST-2 fused to EYFP. This gene was stably expressed in CHO cells using the procedure outlined below. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—The sulfotransferase-EYFP fusion plasmids were linearized using AseI, and the GFP fusion was linearized with PvuI. The linearized plasmids were transfected into CHO-K1 cells. After 48 h of transfection, 1 mg/ml G418 (Mediatech) was added to the medium to select for stable integrants. After 2 weeks of selection, the population of resistant cells was autocloned using a cell sorter, with the fluorescent protein signal used for gating. Individual clones were expanded and used without further subcloning. The stable expression of GlcNAc6ST-1-ECFP in the GlcNAc6ST-3-EYFP cell line was accomplished by transfection of the plasmid GlcNAc6ST-1-ECFP pIRES puro2. After 48 h of transfection the cells were treated with 5 μg/ml puromycin (Clontech). After 2 weeks of selection, individual foci were selected with cloning rings, expanded to confluence in a 6-well plate, and then cloned by limiting dilution. Cells expressing TGN38 human Ig were selected using the hygromycin resistance gene encoded on the plasmid and were treated with 300 μg/ml hygromycin for 2 weeks. Cells expressing this construct were not cloned. Flow Cytometry—Cells (2 × 106) were seeded in a 10-cm dish 24 h prior to transfection. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were lifted with trypsin/EDTA and then replated. After another 24 h, the cells were lifted with 1 mm EDTA in PBS, washed twice with FACS buffer (0.1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS), and then counted. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on 500,000 cells. All antibodies were used at a concentration of 1 μg/106 cells except for G72 hybridoma supernatant, which was used at a 1/10 dilution. The primary antibody was applied in 50 μl of FACS buffer and incubated with the cells on ice for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and then incubated in 50 μl of diluted secondary reagent for 30 min. The cells were washed twice and then incubated with streptavidin tricolor conjugate. The cells were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Enzyme Treatments—Approximately 300,000 cells were plated in a 12-well dish 24 h prior to treatment. Heparinase II (Sigma) and keratanase (ICN Biomedicals) were used at 0.1 unit/ml. Cells were washed twice with PBS. Wells that were incubated with heparinase were filled with 200 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 4 mm CaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. Keratanase-treated wells were filled with 200 μl of PBS. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, lifted with EDTA, and then analyzed by flow cytometry as above. Small Molecule Inhibitors of Glycosylation—Cells were plated at ∼300,000 cells/well in a 12-well dish. Tunicamycin (Sigma) was added to the medium at a concentration of 5 ng/ml, and α-BnGalNAc (Sigma) was used at concentrations varying from 1 to 16 mm. The cells were grown in the presence of the inhibitors for 2 days and were then processed for flow cytometry as above. Isolation of GlyCAM-IgG—GlcNAc6ST-3-EYFP-expressing CHO cells were transfected with GlyCAM-IgG, GlyCAM-IgG and Core2GlcNAcT-I, or empty vector. One day after transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with human endothelial serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.25 mCi/ml 35S-labeled sulfate (ICN Biomedicals) for 4 days. The medium was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and then concentrated to 1.5 ml. The concentrate was incubated with 0.5 ml of a slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories) (50% by volume) overnight at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were washed with 10 ml of PBS with 0.05% Tween 20. The GlyCAM-IgG chimera was eluted from the beads with 1.5 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.9, then neutralized with 150 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 8. Each sample was lyophilized and resuspended in water. Half of the purified GlyCAM-IgG was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining to assess the quantity of protein in each lane. The gel was then exposed to a phosphor screen, which was analyzed by phosphorimaging using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Western Blots—Approximately 6 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, then once with cold 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. To lyse the cells, 200 μl of the HEPES buffer containing protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture III, Calbiochem) was added to each plate, and the plates were incubated on ice for 10 min. The cells were scraped from the each plate, and the supernatants were transferred to centrifuge tubes and clarified at 2,500 × g for 5 min. The total protein content of each lysate was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) with BSA as the standard. An aliquot (9 μg) of each lysate was loaded onto a 12% gel and analyzed by Western blot on a nitrocellulose membrane probed with rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal serum (Molecular Probes), followed by goat anti-rabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunolabs). The blot was developed using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) and Kodak film. Microscopy—Cells were seeded on slides mounted with tissue culture wells (LAB-TEK) and allowed to adhere for 2 days. For experiments involving cycling to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), brefeldin A (BFA) (Sigma) was added to the cells at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and then incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed three times with PBS, then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After three washes, the cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times and then blocked in PBS with 1% BSA for 20 min, followed by the addition of the first antibody diluted in blocking buffer. After a 2-h incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed three times and then incubated with the secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h. After three washes, the cells were mounted using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs). A Leica DMIRB/E inverted microscope equipped with a xenon arc lamp using a 63× lens was employed for imaging. Image stacks containing 50-60 sections spaced 0.3 μm apart were acquired using a Quantix CCD camera (Roper Scientific). An 8600 Sedat quad filter set with single band excitation and emission filters (Chroma) was used, allowing the imaging of DAPI, GFP (or EYFP), Cy3, and Cy5 without any concern for register among the different channels. When ECFP was included, a filter set allowing the acquisition of ECFP and EYFP (Chroma) was used along with the appropriate channels of the quad set. Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Solutions) was used to control the microscope and the camera. The image stacks were digitally deconvolved using the nearest neighbor algorithm of Slidebook. Quantitation of Colocalization—Quantitation of colocalization was performed using the software Colocalization 1.2 (Bitplane, Inc., Zürich). Image stacks from individual cells were processed by background subtraction, and individual channels were converted to TIFF format and imported into the software. The pixel intensity values were converted to histograms, and regions of the histograms were chosen which gave cross-correlation values >97%. A binary mask was generated which contained the highly correlated pixels. The plane corresponding to the fluorescence micrograph was displayed. Values for percent colocalization, which denotes the sum of the intensities of colocalized pixels divided by the sum of the intensities of all pixels with nonzero value, were determined using masks giving >97% cross-correlation, according to software protocols. Images of three or four cells from each sample were processed. For comparative purposes, we labeled CHO cells with anti-GM130 mAb followed by a 1:1 mixture of Alexa 568- and Alexa 647-labeled secondary antibody. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using the same conditions as with all other cells in this study. Image processing gave a colocalization value of 80%. We therefore consider this to be the maximum achievable value for percent colocalization. Generation of Cell Lines Stably Expressing Fluorescent Protein-labeled Sulfotransferases and Determination of Preferred Cellular Substrates—We selected CHO cells as the host for these studies based on four considerations. First, all three sulfotransferases in this study have been expressed successfully in either transient or stable form in these cells and their activity demonstrated on either secreted or membrane glycoproteins (16Hiraoka N.

Third, CHO cells have limited ability to elaborate GlcNAc-containing O-linked glycans, which provided a low background environment for the studies herein. Finally, there are no appropriate human cell lines for studying the properties of these enzymes. GlcNAc6ST-2 and -3 are only known to be expressed in two cell lines (the adenocarcinoma lines LS180 and LS174T) (30Uchimura K. El-Fasakhany F.M. Hori M. Hemmerich S. Blink S.E. Kansas G.S.

They bind to the enzyme-NADH complex and are uncompetitive inhibitors against varied concentrations of alcohol. Fourteen new branched chain and chiral formamides were prepared and tested as inhibitors of purified Class I liver alcohol dehydrogenases: horse (EqADH E), human (HsADH1C*2), and mouse (MmADH1). In general, larger, substituted formamides, such as N-1-ethylheptylformamide, are better inhibitors of HsADH1C*2 and MmADH1 than of EqADH, reflecting a few differences in amino acid residues that change the sizes of the active sites. In contrast, the linear, alkyl (n-propyl and n-butyl) formamides are better inhibitors of EqADH and MmADH1 than of HsADH1C*2, probably because water disrupts van der Waals interactions. These enzymes are also inhibited strongly by sulfoxides and 4-substituted pyrazoles. The structure of EqADH complexed with NADH and (R)-N-1-methylhexylformamide was determined by x-ray crystallography at 1.6 Å resolution. The structure resembles the expected Michaelis complex with NADH and aldehyde, and shows for the first time that the reduced nicotinamide ring of NADH is puckered, as predicted for the transition state for hydride transfer. Metabolism of ethanol in mice was inhibited by several formamides. The data were fitted with kinetic simulation to a mechanism that describes the non-linear progress curves and yields estimates of the in vivo inhibition constants and the rate constants for elimination of inhibitors. Some small formamides, such as N-isopropylformamide, may be useful inhibitors in vivo.

The five different human enzymes have broad substrate specificity, oxidizing primary and secondary alcohols and reducing their corresponding carbonyl compounds. Specific inhibitors of these dehydrogenases would be useful for defining substrate specificity, for studying the physiological roles of the enzymes and for preventing the oxidation of methanol and ethylene glycol to toxic products (2Plapp B.V.

We now extend the studies with 14 new branched-chain and chiral formamides in order to explore active site topologies and to make more effective inhibitors for the mouse (MmADH1) and human (HsADH1C*2) enzymes. For comparison, we also studied the potency of five sulfoxides and two 4-substituted pyrazoles with purified MmADH1.We also studied the inhibition by five compounds of ethanol metabolism in mice as a model animal. We used numerically integrated rate equations that describe the non-linear progress curves and provide good estimates of inhibition constants in vivo. The results provide information for optimizing the sizes of inhibitors for maximal efficacy.We determined by x-ray crystallography the structure of the complex of horse liver ADH with NADH and a potent, chiral formamide inhibitor, which binds as an analogue of an aldehyde. The structure shows, for the first time in a ternary complex of a dehydrogenase with NADH, that the reduced nicotinamide ring is puckered, as expected for the transition state for hydrogen transfer. The structure also provides a basis for interpreting the structure-function relationships of the inhibitors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Native crystalline horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (EE isoenzyme), LiNAD+ and Na2NADH were purchased from Roche Applied Science. The plasmid for the expression of HsADH1C*2 was obtained from Dr. Jan-Olov Höög (Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) and that of MmADH1 from Dr. Gregg Duester (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). Amines and other reagents were obtained from Lancaster and Aldrich Chemical Co. Some formamides and sulfoxides were prepared previously (11Chadha V.K. Leidal K.G. Plapp B.V. J. Med.

N-1-Cyclohexylethyl and N-1-(4-methylphenyl)-ethyl formamides were solids and were recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane or dichloromethane. Final yields were 50–70%. Compounds were characterized using a Varian 500 MHz or a Bruker AC 300 NMR spectrometer. Multiple resonances are due to the cis-trans (Z,E) isomerism of the formamide group. The major geometrical isomer was cis (∼70–80%). Mass spectra (MS or high resolution, HRMS) were obtained using a Micromass Autospec M spectrometer. The structure of each compound was confirmed by three different analytical methods.N-1,2-Dimethylpropylformamide— 1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): δ = 8.15 (0.8H, s, CHO), 8.04 (0.2H, d, J = 12 Hz, CHO), 6.16 and 5.98 (1H, 2br s, NH), 3.95 and 3.3 (1H, 2m, CH), 1.71 (1H, m, CH), 1.2 and 1.1 (3H, 2d, J = 6.7 Hz, CH3), 0.93 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, CH3), 0.92 (3H, d, J = 6.6 Hz, CH3); 13C NMR (CDCl3, 75.5 MHz): δ = 164.2 (E-CHO), 160.7 (Z-CHO), 53.7 (E-N-CH), 48.8 (Z-N-CH), 33.8 (E-CH-CH), 32.8 (Z-CH-CH), 18.4, 17.5; Anal.

Chem. 1989; 264: 11112-11116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse ADH1 was purified using the following procedure, which gave better yields than the general procedure suggested by Qiagen. Mouse ADH1 was expressed in Escherichia coli M15 (pREP4) from the full-length cDNA linked to a His6 tag in the pQE-30 plasmid (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C on plates and in starter cultures with LB media containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin and used to inoculate 9-liter cultures of LB without antibiotics. At an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. Cells were allowed to grow at 30 °C for 16 h, collected by centrifugation and stored at –20 °C overnight. Cell paste was thawed and suspended in 3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, per gram of cell paste. Subsequent steps were at 0–4 °C. Lysozyme (1 mg/ml, total volume) was added, and the suspension was stirred for 30 min. The cells were sonicated for 12 cycles of 30 s each with intermittent cooling. Protamine sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.2%, and the mixture was centrifuged after stirring for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column (100 ml), and the enzyme was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The fractions with ADH activity were concentrated with an Amicon concentrator with a YM30 membrane under 40 psi N2 while the buffer was changed to 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 300 mm sodium chloride and 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The enzyme was loaded onto a 15 ml nickel nitrilotriacetate-affinity column, which was washed with 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm sodium chloride, and 20 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0, until the effluent had negligible protein. The column was developed with a 200-ml linear gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole. Fractions with ADH activity were concentrated with an Amicon concentrator with a YM30 membrane under 40 psi N2 while the buffer was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl and 0.25 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, in order to remove imidazole. The enzyme was again loaded onto a DEAE column (15 ml), eluted with the 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, and concentrated and stored at 4 °C.About 100 mg of protein was obtained from 9 L of culture. Electrophoretic analysis using polyacrylamide gel with sodium dodecyl sulfate showed a single band at the position expected for an ADH subunit (40 kDa). The ratio of tyrosine to tryptophan predicted from the sequence (3:2) was confirmed with an UV-absorption spectrum of the protein in 0.1 m NaOH (17Beaven G.H. Holiday E.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1952; 7: 319-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The absorption at 280 for a 1 mg/ml solution was estimated to be 0.37 at neutral pH from the spectrum in alkali. The turnover number was determined to be 0.66 s–1 and 1.07 s–1 based on a standard assay (18Plapp B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1727-1735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C and 37 °C, respectively.X-ray Crystallography—Crystals of wild-type EqADH complexed with NADH and (R)-N-1-methylhexylformamide were prepared as described by the general procedure used previously (19Ramaswamy S. Eklund H. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5230-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recrystallized horse liver enzyme from Roche Applied Science (about 0.5 ml of 9.4 mg/ml) was dialyzed at 4 °C against 10 ml of 50 mm ammonium N-[Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonate, pH 6.7 (measured at 25 °C) with 1 mm NADH and 5 mm (R)-N-1-methylhexylformamide, and the concentration of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol was raised over 24 days to 21%, when crystals formed. The concentration of diol was finally raised to 25% over 17 more days. X-ray data were collected at 100 K at the IMCA-CAT beam line at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratories with a wavelength of 1.000 Å, a crystal to detector distance of 140 nm, an exposure time of 1 s, and an oscillation angle of 0.3 Å, for a total of 600 images. The data were processed with DEN20 and SCALEPACK (20Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (21Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) and the coordinates for the refined wild-type horse ADH-NAD+-2,3,4,5,6-pentaflourobenzyl alcohol complex (PDB entry 1hld) as a model. The structure was refined by cycles of restrained refinement using REFMAC (22CCP4 SuiteActa Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) and model building with the program O (23Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The initial electron density maps were calculated without including the formamide, but after one cycle of refinement, the positions for the formamides in all four subunits were readily apparent. Initially, the dictionary used for NADH maintained planarity of the nicotinamide ring, but the electron density maps clearly showed that the ring was not planar. Therefore, during the final cycles of refinement, the dictionary for NADH was modified to remove the restraints on planarity and torsion angles, as would be appropriate for NADH.Biological Evaluation—The effects of the inhibitors on ethanol metabolism in mice were studied by the following procedure. Fed, male Swiss-Webster mice (20–25 g, obtained from Harlan-Sprague, Indianapolis, IN) were administered intraperitoneal injections of the inhibitor in a dose of 0 to about 1 mmol/kg of body weight. The solutions of inhibitor were 0.1 m or lower in physiological saline. Ethanol (4 m in physiological saline) was administered 20–30 min later, by intraperitoneal injection at 65 mmol/kg of body weight. Blood samples (10 μl) were drawn from the tail at intervals timed from the ethanol injection. The blood alcohol concentration was determined by gas chromatography as previously described (10Chadha V.K. Leidal K.G. Plapp B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).RESULTSEvaluation of Inhibitors with Purified Enzymes—We determined the inhibition constants for the series of N-substituted formamides, sulfoxides, and pyrazoles by initial velocity studies with varied concentrations of the inhibitor and a substrate appropriate for each purified alcohol dehydrogenase. Formamides produce uncompetitive inhibition against varied concentrations of ethanol and competitive inhibition against varied concentrations of cyclohexanone (Fig. 1). Previous studies showed that the Ki values are not dependent on the substrate used and that the inhibition constants determined for the forward or reverse reaction were about (within 2-fold) the same (10Chadha V.K. Leidal K.G. Plapp B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 13Ramaswamy S. Scholze M. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3522-3527Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Schindler J.F. Berst K.B. Plapp B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 1696-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Cho H. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4482-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The simplest kinetic explanation for the inhibition results is the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism where the inhibitor binds only to the enzyme-NADH complex. For this mechanism, the Ki values represent true dissociation constants since the concentrations of coenzyme were saturating, and dissociation of NADH is rate-limiting for turnover (10Chadha V.K. Leidal K.G. Plapp B.V. J. Med. Chem. 1983; 26: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The inhibition constants for EqADH, MmADH1, and HsADH1C*2 are presented in Table I. The Ki values for most of the formamides ranged from about 1 to 100 μm, indicating potent inhibition. These enzymes have a few differences of amino acid residues in the active sites and thus different specificities, which are reflected in Ki values that can differ by 10-fold or more among the enzymes. It is significant, for instance, that the linear N-n-propyl- and N-n-butylformamides ( 1, 2) bind more tightly to EqADH and MmADH1 than to HsADH, whereas the secondary formamides that are branched at the one position ( 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 , and 20) bind more tightly to MmADH1 and HsADH than to EqADH. (R)-N-1-Methylhexylformamide ( 7), its heptyl analogue ( 10) and N-1,5-dimethylhexylformamide ( 11) are particularly potent inhibitors of the human and mouse enzymes, with Ki values less than 1 μm. The methylated cyclohexylformamides are also better inhibitors of MmADH1 and HsADH than of EqADH. It appears that MmADH1 and HsADH have more room in the active site than does EqADH.Table IInhibition of purified liver alcohol dehydrogenases by formamides, sulfoxides, and pyrazolesInhibitorKiEq ADHaInhibition constants were determined with ethanol (0.2-2 mm) as the varied substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation for uncompetitive inhibition.MmADH1aInhibition constants were determined with ethanol (0.2-2 mm) as the varied substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation for uncompetitive inhibition.HsADH1C*2bThe varied substrate was cyclohexanone (1.5-12 mm), and the data were fitted to the equation for competitive inhibition.μ m1N-n-Propylformamide10cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.6.4120cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.2N-n-Butylformamide16cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.12100cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.3N-Isopentylformamide807.6764N-Isopropylformamide2.6cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.6.115cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.5N-1,2-Dimethylpropylformamide4215ND6N-1,4-Dimethylpentylformamide753.7ND7(R)-N-1-Methylhexylformamide150.660.648(S)-N-1-Methylhexylformamide252.34.49N-1-Methylhexylformamide161.61.010N-1-Methylheptylformamide5.4cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.0.420.41cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.11N-1,5-Dimethylhexylformamide170.590.8312N-1-Ethylpropylformamide150315.2cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.13N-1-Ethylhexylformamide1307.72.114N-1-Ethylheptylformamide361.11.315N-Cyclohexylformamide8.7dValue was obtained from Ref. 13.2.55.2aInhibition constants were determined with ethanol (0.2-2 mm) as the varied substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation for uncompetitive inhibition.16N-2-Methylcyclohexylformamide304.30.917N-3-Methylcyclohexylformamide251.92.218(R)-N-1-Cyclohexylethylformamide6001007.819N-Benzylformamide0.74cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.1.74.9cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.20(R)-N-1-(4-Methylphenyl)-ethylformamide189.40.2721Methyl isobutyl sulfoxide340cValues were obtained from Ref. 14.340ND22Methyl hexyl sulfoxide47eValue was obtained from Ref. 10.2611fValues were obtained from Ref. 15.233-Methylthiolane 1-oxide7.5gValues were obtained from Ref. 11.20ND243-Butylthiolane 1-oxide0.56fValues were obtained from Ref. 15.0.400.30fValues were obtained from Ref. 15.253-Hexylthiolane 1-oxide0.19gValues were obtained from Ref. 11.0.120.35fValues were obtained from Ref. 15.264-Methylpyrazole0.013hValues were obtained from Ref. 51.0.150.21iValues from Ref. 52 for the activity of a mixture of isoenzymes.274-Iodopyrazole0.02hValues were obtained from Ref. 51.0.120.12iValues from Ref. 52 for the activity of a mixture of isoenzymes.a Inhibition constants were determined with ethanol (0.2-2 mm) as the varied substrate, and the data were fitted to the equation for uncompetitive inhibition.b The varied substrate was cyclohexanone (1.5-12 mm), and the data were fitted to the equation for competitive inhibition.c Values were obtained from Ref. 14Schindler J.F.

https://openalex.org/W2010031975,"Sialomucin complex (SMC, rat Muc4) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of two subunits, the mucin component ascites sialoglycoprotein ASGP-1 and the transmembrane subunit ASGP-2, which is aberrantly expressed on the surfaces of a variety of tumor cells. Up-regulation of the Muc4/SMC gene in the 13762 sublines of the rat mammary adenocarcinoma correlates with the overexpression of transcription factor PEA3 and the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2.

Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 12051-12059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muc4/SMC consists of a peripheral, O-glycosylated glycoprotein subunit (2Sherblom A.P. Buck R.L. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 783-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ascites sialoglycoprotein-1 (ASGP-1), which is tightly, but non-covalently bound to an N-glycosylated integral membrane glycoprotein ASGP-2 (3Hull S.R. Sheng Z. Vanderpuye O.A. David C. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The latter has two epidermal growth factor-like domains and can act as an intramembrane ligand and modulator of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (4Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Carvajal M.E. Guy P.M. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Muc4/SMC is transcribed from a single gene as a 9-kilobase transcript (5Sheng Z. Wu K. Carraway K.L. Fregien N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16341-16346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and translated into a single ≈300-kDa polypeptide, which is proteolytically cleaved into the two subunits early in its transit to the cell surface (6Sheng Z. Hull S.R. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8505-8510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that the N-terminal amino acid sequence of ASGP-1 and the complete sequence of ASGP-2 from rat SMC are 60-70% identical to the sequence of human MUC4 (7Moniaux N. Nollet S. Porchet N. Degand P. Laine A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Rat SMC differs from human MUC4 by the absence of a 16-amino acid tandem repeat, which was the original identifying characteristic of MUC4 (8Porchet N. Nguyen V.G. Dufosse J. Audie J.P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Gross M.S. Denis C. Degand P. Berheim A. Aubert J.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A number of functions have been attributed to Muc4/SMC. In tumor cells ASGP-1 confers anti-recognition and anti-adhesive properties (9Carraway K.L. Fregien N. Carraway C.A.C. Carraway K.L. II I J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 299-307PubMed Google Scholar), which were demonstrated by the transfection of Muc4/SMC cDNA into A375 melanoma cells. Expression of Muc4/SMC in these cells was found to abolish cell-matrix adhesion and cell-cell interactions (10Komatsu M. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33245-33254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of Muc4/SMC in A375 cells reduces their killing by natural killer cells (11Komatsu M. Yee L. Carraway K.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2229-2236PubMed Google Scholar), which may be important in tumor progression of neoplastic mammary cells. Further, the presence of Muc4/SMC on exposed epithelia such as cornea, vagina, and cervix suggests a protective role for Muc4/SMC (12Price-Schiavi S.A. Meller D. Jing X. Merritt J. Carvajal M.E.

Muc4/SMC is also proposed to modulate cellular signaling through the EGF family of receptors via its interaction with ErbB2 (4Carraway III, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1033-1042PubMed Google Scholar), and the rapid growth of these cells in vivo. The expression patterns of both human MUC4 and rat Muc4/SMC have been studied in detail. MUC4 is expressed in a broad range of secretory epithelial cells. By Northern blotting and/or in situ hybridization, human MUC4 mRNA has been detected in numerous normal tissues such as trachea, colon, stomach, cervix, uterus, prostate, and lung (15Audie J.P.

We have cloned and characterized the 5′-flanking region of the rat Muc4/SMC gene (27Price-Schiavi S.A. Perez A. Barco R. Carraway K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 641-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When compared with the recently published promoter sequence of the human MUC4 (28Perrais M. Pigny P. Ducourouble M.P. Petitprez D. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Van Seuningen I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30923-30933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the rat sequence shows ∼70% homology over the first 464 nucleotides upstream of the first ATG, and then both sequences diverge. Functional studies of the 5′-flanking region of MUC4 in pancreatic cells have shown that two regulatory regions control MUC4 transcription: -219/-145 and -2781/-2572 (28Perrais M. Pigny P.

Analysis of the rat and human MUC4 promoter sequences showed the presence of several Ets regulatory elements, which may bind PEA3 transcription factor (27Price-Schiavi S.A. Perez A. Barco R.

In addition, analysis of the 5′-flanking regulatory of another two mucins MUC2 and MUC5AC shows the presence of several putative binding sites for the transcription factor PEA3 (29Li D. Gallup M.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar). The ets genes, which currently comprise nearly 30 paralogs in mammals, encode transcription factors bearing conserved sequence-related DNA binding domains (the ETS domain) (31Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 751: 1-55Google Scholar). Ets proteins are capable of regulating transcription by binding to sites in the promoters of their cognate target genes. DNA binding is achieved by interaction between the ETS domain and a ∼10-bp sequence element termed the Ets binding site, comprising a highly conserved core sequence, 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′. PEA3 (32Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hasell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) is the founding member of a subfamily of Ets proteins, which also include ER81 (33Brown T.A. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2502-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and ERM (31Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 751: 1-55Google Scholar, 34Chotteau-Lelievre A. Desbiens X. Pelczar H. Defossez P.A. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 937-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Analyses of the transcriptional properties of individual PEA3 subfamily members reveal that they commonly activate transcription (32Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hasell J.A.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1397-1406PubMed Google Scholar). A few PEA3 target genes have been identified; transient transfection studies suggest that PEA3 is capable of regulating transcription of genes whose products facilitate cell motility and invasion (reviewed in Ref. 36de Launoit Y.

PEA3 is overexpressed in the vast majority of human breast tumors and in nearly all of those of the ErbB2-positive subclass (37Benz C.C. O'Hagan R.C. Richter B. Scott G.K. Chang C.H. Xiong X. Chew K.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3037-3042PubMed Google Scholar). PEA3 is similarly overexpressed in transgenic mouse models of this malignancy (38Trimble M.S. Xin J.H. Guy C.T. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3037-3042PubMed Google Scholar, 39Shepherd T.G. Kockeritz L. Szrajber M.R. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Expression of dominant-negative PEA3 in the mouse mammary gland of MMTV-ErbB2 transgenic mice dramatically reduces the incidence of mammary tumors (39Shepherd T.G. Kockeritz L. Szrajber M.R. Muller W.J. Hassell J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1739-1748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that PEA3 plays a role in mammary oncogenesis or tumor progression. To assess the role of the PEA3 gene in Muc4/SMC expression, we measured the ability of PEA3 to affect the transcriptional activity of Muc4/SMC. The transactivation capacity of PEA3 subfamily ets genes has been shown to be dramatically increased by Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPKs ERK-1 and ERK-2 (40Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 41Janknecht R. Monte D. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1745-1754PubMed Google Scholar, 42O'Hagan R.C. Tozer R.G. Symons M. McCormick F. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 18: 6278-6286Google Scholar). The JNK/SAPK pathway is also involved in PEA3 group member activation (42O'Hagan R.C. Tozer R.G. Symons M. McCormick F. Hassell J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 18: 6278-6286Google Scholar). To learn specifically how the Muc4/SMC activity is regulated by PEA3, we inquired whether constitutively activated Ha-Ras (Ha-RasV12) and Ras downstream effectors are capable of enhancing the transcriptional activity of Muc4/SMC by PEA3 in HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. The mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 has been shown to be a good model for studying mammary cell differentiation and gene regulatory mechanisms taking place in mammary cells (43Doppler W. Groner B. Ball R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that ERK and JNK/SAPK pathways independently stimulated PEA3-dependent Muc4/SMC gene expression in HC11 cells. Transcriptionally activated PEA3 stimulates Muc4/SMC expression, thus accounting in part for the increased Muc4/SMC mRNA and protein levels found in 13762 ascites cells compared with normal mammary epithelial cells.

Cells—MAT-B1 and MAT-C1 cells are ascites sublines of the 13762 rat mammary tumor. Both sublines were passaged by weekly transfers into 2-3-month-old female Fischer rats and also maintained as frozen stocks (51Carraway K.L. Fogle D.D. Chesnut R.W. Huggins J.W. Carraway C.A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6173-6178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sublines differ in morphology and in the O-glycosylation of ASGP-1. Cells used in these studies were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline after recovery from the peritoneal cavity. The MAT BIII cultured subline of the 13762 rat mammary adenocarcinoma was obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The normal mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 was a gift from Dr. Jeffrey Rosen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Cell Culture—Primary mammary epithelial cell cultures were established using previously described protocols (52Lee E.Y.-H. Parry G. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 53Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway C.A.C. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, mammary glands excised from virgin, pregnant, or lactating female Fischer 344 rats were minced and resuspended in digestion media comprising 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ), and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in Ham's F-12 medium and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 45 min. Fully and partially digested epithelial cell clusters were pelleted and incubated a second time in digestion buffer at 37 °C with shaking for 45 min. Digested epithelial cell clusters were pelleted, resuspended in PBS, and passed through a 520-μm cell sieve to remove undigested material. Mammary epithelial cell clusters in the resulting filtrate were captured on a 70-μm nylon membrane. Cell clusters were collected by rinsing the membrane with PBS and were subsequently washed three times in PBS prior to plating. Incubating freshly isolated cells on a plastic tissue culture plate for 1 h permitted attachment and removal of fibroblasts. The isolated cell preparations contained >85% epithelial cells (54Seely K.A. Aggeler J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 146: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), as judged by staining for cytokeratins (55Lane E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and Muc4/SMC (21Rossi E.A. McNeer R. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Van den Brande J.M.H. Thompson J.F. Carraway C.A.C.

The HC11 mouse mammary cell line was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 ng/ml EGF. The MAT-B1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS. The 13762 MAT BIII cell line was cultured in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Whole Cell Extracts—Mammary tissue from virgin, pregnant, and lactating rats as well as from ascites and cultured cells, were lysed with PBS plus 0.5% SDS containing protease inhibitors and sonicated. The lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g and pellet discarded. Lysates were stored at -80 °C until used for immunoblot analyses. Northern Blots—Total RNA was isolated using TRI ReagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), and 25 μg were electrophoresed on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. Resolved RNAs were transferred to ZetaProbe positively charged nylon membranes (Bio-Rad) and cross-linked with a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The membranes were prehybridized for at least 2 h at 42 °C in prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). The probe, A2G2-#9 (56Wu K. Fregien N. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11950-11955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 1.7-kb DNA fragment that spans the 5′ unique region and four tandem repeats of Muc4/SMC cDNA, was random primer-labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in prehybridization solution containing 0.1 g/ml dextran sulfate and the labeled probe. Following hybridization, membranes were washed once at room temperature in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 15 min, twice at 50 °Cin2× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 20 min each, and once at 50 °C in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 15 min. Signals were detected by exposure with Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. Immunoblot Analyses—Whole cell and nuclear extracts (1-15 μg of protein) were analyzed in 7% polyacrylamide gels with the Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then probed with primary and secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected by the RenaissanceTM enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase Reporter Constructs—For PEA3 transactivation studies, a fragment containing 335 bases of the Muc4/SMC promoter region was generated by PCR of rat uterine genomic DNA. To 100 ng of genomic DNA, 10 pmol of oligonucleotide primers, Taq polymerase, 1 μlof10mm dNTPs, and 3 μl of 25 mm MgCl2 were added. The primers used were: Left (2003-2024), 5′-GCTCTAGACCTGGCTGCCTTCTACAGTA-3′; and Right (2394-2413), 5′-CGGGATTCCTCAGGAATCTCCACAGCA-3′. The nucleotide positions are given according to the Muc4 promoter sequence (GenBankTM accession no. AF240632). Reactions were temperature-cycled in a Gene Cycler (Bio-Rad) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min (1 cycle); 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles); and 72 °C for 10 min (1 cycle). Oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce an XbaI site at the 5′ end of the 335-bp fragment and a BamHI at the 3′ end. This allowed the successful ligation of the fragment into the pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega). After gel purification, the fragment was digested with XbaI and BamHI. This fragment was then ligated to the pGL3-Basic vector digested with NheI and BglII. The ligation mixture was transformed into XL-1 Blue competent cells (Stratagene), plated, propagated in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and purified using a Maxiprep Kit (Qiagen). Accurate cloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing at the DNA Core Laboratory (University of Miami, Miami, FL). The construct was designated WT-PEA3. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutation of the PEA3 binding site was performed on WT-PEA3 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). 10 ng of WT-PEA3 was combined with complementary mutant oligonucleotide primers (125 ng), 1 μlof10mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. The oligonucleotide primers used were as follows: sense (2167-2102; the nucleotide position is defined according to the sequence of the Muc4 promoter (GenBankTM accession no. AF240632), 5′-GGGGCCGTAGGCAGGTTGGTGCCCTCTCTCACTTCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGAAGTGAGAGAGGGCACCAACCTGCCTACGGCCCC-3′ (the underlined letters represent the bases along the PEA3 binding sequence that were mutated). The reaction mixture was temperature-cycled in a Gene Cycler (Bio-Rad). Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 30 s (1 cycle), then 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 10 min (12 cycles). This series of cycles serves to amplify the MT-PEA3 construct. Cell Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transfections were performed in triplicate using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well 24 h before transfection. Each well was transfected for 3 h using a mixture of 1 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM medium, 1-2 μg of plasmid DNA (including 10 ng of pRL-CMV), and 15 μl of LipofectAMINE. Where necessary “empty” vectors were included to maintain a constant amount of DNA. The media were then changed to the appropriate medium optimum for growth of each cell type. Lysates were prepared 24-48 h after transfection, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual Luciferase Reagent kit (Promega) and a LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold GmbH). Firefly activity was normalized to Renilla activity, and results were expressed as relative light units. For experiments with kinase inhibitor U0126, the HC11 cells were cultured in serum-free RPMI medium for 24 h before transfection followed by 30-min treatment of U0126 at 80 μm and then the transfection was done as described above. Plasmid Constructs—The following plasmids were used for expressing PEA3 derivatives as N-terminal 6-histidine-tagged and C-terminal Myc/6-histidine-tagged proteins in mammalian cell transfections. The pHis-N152PEA3 (encoding mPEA3 amino acids 152-480) was constructed by inserting the EcoRI/XbaI-digested PCR-derived fragment into the same sites in pcDNA3.1/His A (Invitrogen). The primers used for the PCR cloning were: Left (801-818), 5′-GGAATTCCAGAACAGCAGCAGAGCCTCC; and Right (1762-1781), 5′-GCTCTAGAATCCACCTCTGTGGCCGAAGG. The pmyc-His C440 PEA3 (encoding mPEA3 amino acids 1-440) was constructed by inserting the NheI-EcoRI-digested PCR-derived fragment into the same sites in pcDNA3.1/myc-His (-) A (Invitrogen). The primers used for this PCR reaction were: Left (346-367), 5′-GCGGCTAGCCGGATGGAGCGGAGGATGAA; and Right (1645-1665), 5′-GGAATTCCAGCCTTCAGAGCTGGACGTT. Nucleotide position is defined according to the sequence of mPEA3 (GenBankTM accession no. X63190). The PCR reactions were conducted under the following conditions: initial annealing at 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min.

https://openalex.org/W1977791042,"Abstract Blisterase is a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase of nematodes. The enzyme is named after the blistered cuticle found in Caenorhabditis elegans with the bli-4 e937 mutation. The critical role of the enzyme in cuticle production makes it a potential drug target for parasitic nematodes. We have cloned and expressed blisterase from the parasitic nematode Onchocerca volvulus, a major cause of blindness in Africa. The catalytic domain of the protease exhibits 84% identity with the corresponding domain of its closest homologue, C. elegans blisterase. O. volvulus blisterase expressed in insect cells has maximal activity in 1 mm calcium at neutral pH. The protease is inhibited by EDTA, the suicide substrate decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone, α1-antitrypsin Portland and by its own propeptide. Substrate assays with fluorescent peptides show that O. volvulus blisterase requires a P4 arginine and a basic amino acid at P1 for cleavage. The kcat of blisterase on the peptide substrate, t-butyloxycarbonyl-RVRR-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide was determined to be 0.018 s-1. In vitro cleavage studies with the nematode polyprotein antigen demonstrated that blisterase cleaved at tetrabasic (RRKR) but not at dibasic (KR) sites. This report describes the first biochemical characterization of the nematode specific protease, blisterase."
https://openalex.org/W2050725518,"CD28 costimulation, an important second signal for antigen-mediated T cell activation, is known to enhance expression of several genes important for the regulation of CD4+ T cell effector function including interleukin-2 and CD154. Previous studies demonstrate CD28-mediated enhancement of the transcription and expression of Fas ligand (CD95L) in T cell lines, suggesting a regulatory link between CD28 and CD95L expression. These results served as the basis for structure/function analysis of the CD95L promoter to elucidate the mechanism for CD28-mediated enhancement of CD95L. In this report, we describe a novel response element, located at -210 to -201 bp upstream of the transcription start site, that confers CD28 responsiveness to the CD95L gene. This response element is homologous to the CD28 response element (CD28RE) previously identified in the IL-2 promoter and bears structural similarities to a newly identified CD28RE in the CD154 promoter. We further demonstrate that CD28-mediated enhancement of promoter activity correlates with enhanced expression of CD95L mRNA, cell surface expression of CD95L protein, and increased apoptosis of CD95+ target cells. These results demonstrate a direct transcriptional regulatory role for CD28 in CD95L-mediated functional activity in CD4+ T cells. Mutational analysis of the CD95L promoter also reveals a novel transcriptional repressor element located ∼60 bp 5′ of the CD28RE. The repressor element bears sequence homology to an activator protein-1 element, constitutively binds c-Fos but not c-Jun, and is activation-independent.

Ligation of receptors on the surface of T cells induces a series of signaling events culminating in specific gene expression via the activation and translocation of specific transcription factors to the nucleus. Ligation of the T cell receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; CD28RE, CD28 response element; CD95L, CD95 ligand; IL, interleukin; IFNγ, interferon γ; AP-1, activator protein-1; RLU, relative luciferase units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; CD28RE, CD28 response element; CD95L, CD95 ligand; IL, interleukin; IFNγ, interferon γ; AP-1, activator protein-1; RLU, relative luciferase units; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. is known to activate several transacting factors that mediate cytokine induction and proliferation in activated T cells. NF-κB and members of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor of activated T cells play important roles in regulating genes important for T cell-specific proliferation and function (1Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar, 2Villalba M. Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Altman A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5813-5819PubMed Google Scholar). Optimal activation of T cells, however, requires at least two signals: the primary signal transduced via the TCR upon ligation to the antigen-major histocompatibility complex complex and a second signal delivered via “costimulatory” molecules (3Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). Prototypical of these costimulatory molecules is CD28, a 44-kDa homodimer expressed constitutively by most T cells (3Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligands of CD28 include B7.1 (CD80) and B7.2 (CD86), whose expression is restricted primarily to antigen-presenting cells (4Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). Costimulation through CD28 by CD80/CD86 is not only required for optimal T cell activation but also promotes T cell survival (3Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 4Lenschow D.J. Walunas T.L. Bluestone J.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 233-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar). Whereas the scope of cellular alterations induced by CD28 signaling is not clearly defined, CD28-mediated costimulation is known to enhance expression of several genes important in CD4+ T cell effector function, including interleukin-2 (IL-2), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon γ (IFNγ), and CD154 (7Michel F.

Although CD28 costimulation is known to enhance target gene expression both by post-transcriptional stabilization of mRNA and direct transcriptional regulation, the promoter regions of the aforementioned CD28-responsive genes possess a functional CD28RE along with several TCR-responsive elements (3Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell.

CD28-induced transcriptional regulation of gene expression is mediated through the induction of transcription factor complex binding to specific elements in the 5′ regulatory regions of CD28-responsive genes (12Faris M. Kokot N. Latinis K. Kasibhatla S. Green D.R. Koretzky G.A. Nel A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 134-144PubMed Google Scholar, 13Holtz-Heppelmann C.J. Algeciras A. Badley A.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4471-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Originally identified in the IL-2 gene, the CD28 response element (CD28RE) that is located -162 to -153 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site is required for CD28-mediated enhancement of IL-2 mRNA and protein expression in TCR-activated T cells (9Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). CD28 ligation induces the binding of a multiprotein complex to the response element that is capable of increasing transcriptional activity and gene expression in cooperation with TCR-mediated signaling but is not sufficient to transactivate by CD28 ligation alone (6Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A.

Similar dependence of TCR signaling also is seen in the CD28RE identified in the CD154 gene (17Lindgren H. Axcrona K. Leanderson T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4578-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Parra E. Mustelin T. Dohlsten M. Mercola D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2437-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The multiprotein complex that binds to the CD28RE is composed of several transcription factors ubiquitously activated by TCR signaling, including the NF-κB/Rel and AP1 family of proteins (19Matsui K. Xiao S. Fine A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3002-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transcription complex only binds the CD28RE after CD28 costimulation (3Appleman L.J. Berezovskaya A. Grass I. Boussiotis V.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 21Xiao S. Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Widom R.L. Ju S.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3456-3465Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whereas the identified CD28REs in CD28-responsive genes other than IL-2 have some sequence homology with the IL-2 CD28RE, no specific motif has yet been defined. Instead, the response elements in other CD28-responsive genes have been defined empirically, through structure/function analysis of the promoter regions. Fas ligand (CD95L), a type II transmembrane protein expressed by activated T cells, is a potent mediator of apoptosis in cells that express its cognate receptor CD95 (22Brunner T. Yoo N.J. LaFace D. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 23el Khatib M. Stanger B.Z. Dogan H. Cui H. Ju S.T. Cell. Immunol. 1995; 163: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). CD95L is the primary mediator of cytolytic activity in CD4+ T cells and therefore plays a critical role in effector function of CD4+ T cells (14Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Luciani M.F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated CD28-dependent enhancement of transcriptional activity in CD4+ T cells isolated from CD95L promoter/luciferase reporter transgenic mice (16Norian L.A. Latinis K.M. Eliason S.L. Lyson K. Yang C. Ratliff T. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4471-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This observation, when combined with other published studies demonstrating enhanced CD95L-dependent cytotoxic activity of T cell lines after costimulation via CD28, suggests a regulatory link between CD28 costimulation and CD95L expression (34Thilenius A.R. Sabelko-Downes K.A. Russell J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wang R. Rogers A.M. Ratliff T.L. Russell J.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2961-2968PubMed Google Scholar). The focus of this study was to identify the role and mechanism of CD28-mediated enhancement of CD95L expression in CD4+ T cells. Through the use of deletion/mutation mapping of the murine CD95L promoter, we identified a novel response element that conferred CD28 responsiveness to the CD95L gene. This response element is homologous to the CD28RE in the IL-2 promoter and bears structural similarities to a newly identified CD28RE in the CD154 promoter (9Fraser J.D. Irving B.A. Crabtree G.R. Weiss A. Science. 1991; 251: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 18Parra E. Mustelin T. Dohlsten M. Mercola D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2437-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, we demonstrate that CD28-mediated enhancement of promoter activity via this novel CD28RE correlates with enhanced expression of CD95L mRNA, cell surface expression of CD95L protein, and increased CD95L-mediated apoptosis. These results demonstrate a direct transcriptional regulatory role for CD28 in CD95L-mediated functional activity of CD4+ T cells. In addition, during the course of our studies, a response element with sequence homology to an AP-1 binding element was demonstrated to attenuate transcriptional activity of the CD95L promoter, suggesting a dual role for the AP-1 family of transcription factors in the modulation of CD95L. Cell Lines and Antibodies—The T cell hybridoma line A1.1 and the L1210 and L1210-Fas cell lines have been previously described (33Rouvier E. Luciani M.F. Golstein P. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 34Thilenius A.R. Sabelko-Downes K.A. Russell J.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 643-650PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm l-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The antibodies to CD3 (145-2C11) and murine CD95L (mFL3) were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The agonistic CD28 antibody (clone 37.51) was obtained from e-Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Plasmid Constructions—Genomic DNA was isolated from A1.1 cells using DNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A 720-bp PCR fragment corresponding to the promoter region of CD95L (-689 to +65) was generated using the upstream primer 5′-GTACCTCAGTTTTCATCTGGTGACCAGAAG-3′ and the downstream primer 5′-GCACCCAGCCCCAGGAAAGG-3′ in a PCR using platinum Pfx high fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen) and 50 ng of A1.1 genomic DNA template. The resultant 720-bp fragment was gel-purified, an A overhang was generated by treatment with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and dATP for 15 min, and cloned into the Topo-PCR2.1 T/A cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced for orientation and fidelity. This plasmid (PCR2.1–689pCD95L) served as the source of the insert for further plasmid constructions. To make the -689 to +65 luciferase reporter plasmid, the 720-bp insert was excised with SacI and XhoI and ligated into the SstI/XhoI site of pGL-3 Basic luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To make the 5′ truncation mutants, shorter fragments were generated using new upstream primers, and the common downstream primer was used to make the -689 to +65 insert. For the -253 to +65 fragment, the upstream primer 5′-CAGGCAAGCCTGGTTTACCAGCC-3′ and the common downstream primer were used. To generate the -201 to +65 fragment, the upstream primer 5′-CGAAGACTTGTCGTCAGAAATTTCTGGGC-3′ was used. The -168 to +65 fragment was produced using 5′-CTTCCTGGGGTTGCTGTGAGCTTTTTG-3′. The -138 to +65 fragment was produced by using the upstream primer 5′-GCTTCTCAGCTTCAGATGCAAGTGAGTG-3′. The resultant fragments were subcloned into the polylinker site of Topo PCR2.1 T/A vector and sequenced for orientation and fidelity. Luciferase reporter constructs were produced by excising the various fragments with SacI and XhoI and then subcloning the fragments into the polylinker site of pGL-3 Basic. Site-directed mutations to putative elements in the CD95L promoter region for the reporter constructs were produced using the PCR-ligation-PCR method previously described (36Ali S.A. Steinkasserer A. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 746-750PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments flanking the region to be deleted or mutated were produced using specific primers and Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen). The fragments generated were gel-purified, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), mixed, and ligated with T4 ligase (Invitrogen). Finally, full-length fragments containing the internal deletions or mutations were amplified using the 5′ and 3′ distal primers. The fragment was subcloned into Topo 2.1 PCR, sequenced for fidelity and orientation, and then subcloned into pGL-3 Basic. Transfections/Luciferase Assays—A1.1 cells (107) were transfected using DEAE-dextran with 10 μg of the indicated reporter plasmid and 1 μg of the pCMV-βGal control vector. Twenty-four hours following transfection, the cells were replated in duplicate on uncoated 6-well plates or plates coated with either anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) alone or with anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells were harvested by repeated washing with PBS and centrifuged, and extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 70 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was determined by mixing 40 μl of extract with 100 μl of luciferase substrate (Promega) and immediately reading the sample in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by mixing 20 μl of extract with galactolyte β-galactosidase substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA), incubating for 1 h at 25 °C, adding 300 μl of galactolyte accelerator (Tropix), and reading the sample in the luminometer. Luciferase activity was normalized by dividing the mean luciferase RLU by the mean β-galactosidase RLU. The normalized luciferase RLU from the stimulated samples were divided by the normalized RLU of the untreated sample, and values were expressed as “normalized-fold induction.” Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—After stimulation on the antibodycoated plates, cells were harvested by washing with cold PBS and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 5 min to pellet. All subsequent steps were done on ice. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed by passing through a 28-gauge needle four times. The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation for 10 s, and the supernatant was aspirated. The crude nuclei preparation was then extracted by adding 120 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (added fresh just before use) and incubating for 15 min on ice. 120 μl of buffer D was then added (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant was harvested, snap frozen in LN2, and stored at -80 °C. Total protein determinations were done using the BCA protein determination kit from Pierce, using albumin as a protein standard. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and Supershift Analysis—Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to elements in the murine CD95L promoter were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). To make double-stranded oligonucleotides, equimolar quantities of the sense and complementary antisense oligonucleotides were mixed in 1× S1 nuclease buffer (0.05 m sodium acetate, 1 mm zinc acetate, 0.25 m NaCl, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), heated to 100 °C for 3 min, and then allowed to cool to room temperature in a water bath over several hours. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled by mixing 1 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), 8 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in 1× PNK buffer and incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the end-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified from free ATP by passing over a NICK column (Amersham Biosciences). A total of 7 μl of nuclear extract corresponding to 5–10 μg of protein was mixed with 1 μl of radiolabeled oligonucleotide (∼50,000 cpm) in a reaction mix containing 1× binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) as a nonspecific inhibitor in a final volume of 25 μl for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris borate EDTA that has been prerun for 30 min. The gel was visualized on a STORM PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). For the specific and nonspecific competition analyses, equimolar amounts of the cold double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were added to the binding reaction before the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide probe. For the supershift analyses, various amounts of the appropriate polyclonal or nonimmune control sera, purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), were added to the reaction mixtures during the 20-min incubation prior to electrophoresis. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from A1.1 cells following activation on antibody-coated plates using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a reaction using 2 μg of total RNA primed with random hexamers in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Following first strand synthesis, 10% of the reaction volume was used as a DNA template for amplification by PCR. For detection of murine CD95L, the forward and reverse primers were 5′-CTTGGGCTCCTCCAGGGTCAGT-3′ and 5′-TCTCCTCCATTAGCACCAGATCC-3′, respectively. The PCR products generated from the CD95L primers were normalized against PCR products generated from murine β-actin forward (5′-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGTAAAG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATGGAGG-3′), after electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualization of the PCR product with UV light. The band intensity of PCR products was determined using an EpiChemi digital image analysis system (UVP, Upland, CA). Flow Cytometry—Following stimulation, 106 A1.1 cells were harvested by repeated washing with cold PBS and centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting wash (PBS, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.05% sodium azide), containing 1 μl of biotinylated anti-murine CD95L antibody MFL3 (Pharmingen) or 1 μl of biotinylated isotype control antibody, and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cells were washed twice with fluorescence-activated cell sorting wash and resupended in 50 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorting wash and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Sigma) for 10 min on ice. Cells were washed three times and resuspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde. Samples were read on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan (San Jose, CA), and data were analyzed using CellQuest software (Becton-Dickinson). Cytotoxicity Assays—The functional activity of CD95L expressed by antibody-stimulated A1.1 and primary CD4+ T cells was determined by the ability of stimulated, costimulated, or nonstimulated cells to induce apoptosis in Fas+ L1210 target cells. Briefly, L1210 and L1210-Fas cells were labeled with 200 μCi/ml 51Cr (1 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 37 °C and washed three times in complete medium. A1.1 cells or recently activated primary T cells were incubated for 4 h on flat bottom 96-well microtiter plates (BD Biosciences) coated with anti-CD3 antibody, anti-CD28 antibody, both, or neither before the addition of the radiolabeled target cells. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h before the supernatants were harvested using Skatron supernatant harvesting frames (Sterling, VA) and counted on a Cobra II γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). The percentage of specific release was calculated as follows: 100 × (cpm of experimental - cpm of spontaneous release/cpm of maximum release - cpm of spontaneous release). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of triplicate wells per assay and are representative of at least four similar analyses. Preparation of Primary T Cells—Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were obtained from D011.10 TCR transgenic mice following red blood cell lysis. CD4+ T cells were enriched to greater than 96% CD4+ as determined by flow cytometry using a negative selection/magnetic bead CD4+ T cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotech (Sunnyvale, CA). The CD4+ T cells were stimulated and expanded for 2 weeks in coculture with a 10-fold excess of irradiated splenocytes (30 grays) obtained from BALB/c mice that were pulsed with OVA323–339 peptide (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). The medium was supplemented with 100 units/ml recombinant murine IL-2 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Following co-culture, dead cells were removed by Ficoll density centrifugation, and the remaining viable cells were rested by placing them back in culture for 24 h in complete medium containing 100 units/ml IL-2. For the cytotoxicity assays, the recently activated, rested T cells were harvested and replated on antibody-coated plates as described above. Activity of the CD95L Promoter Is Induced by TCR Ligation and Enhanced by CD28 Costimulation—To define the CD28-responsive sequence elements within the CD95L promoter, we utilized deletion/mutation mapping of the 5′ regulatory region of murine CD95L using reporter constructs and transient transfection. The readily transfectable A1.1 T cell hybridoma served as an in vitro cell model for this objective. This line has been used extensively in studying the regulation of CD95L expression and activation-induced cell death, and these cells are sensitive to nonphysiological stimuli that mimic TCR-mediated stimulation, including agonistic antibodies to both CD3 and CD28, phorbol esters, and calcium ionophore (14Kasibhatla S.

Exposure to appropriate hormonal inducers resulted in the differentiation of >80% of the immortalized brown preadipocytes derived from both types of mice into mature adipocytes. Introduction of the Cre recombinase with the use of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer induced a dose-dependent decrease in the abundance of PDK-1 in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes but not in the wild-type cells. In Cre-expressing PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes in which the abundance of PDK-1 was reduced by ∼85%, the insulin-induced phosphorylation both of Akt on threonine 308 and of p70 S6 kinase on threonine-389 was markedly inhibited. The phosphorylation both of Akt on serine 473 and of p42 and p44 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase induced by insulin was not affected by Cre expression, indicating that the latter specifically inhibits PDK-1-dependent signaling. Both glucose uptake and the translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the plasma membrane induced by insulin as well as glucose uptake induced by a constitutively active form of phosphoinositide 3-kinase were also greatly inhibited by Cre expression in PDK-1lox/lox adipocytes. Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and glucose uptake induced by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) were not affected by Cre expression in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes.

Invest. 2002; 110: 1483-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Downstream of PI3-K, the insulin signal is likely mediated by protein kinases whose activities are regulated by PI3-K, including Akt (also known as protein kinase B), p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K), and the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes PKCλ and PKCζ (2Shepherd P.R.

Although the mechanism by which the insulin signal is transmitted from PI3-K to these downstream kinases is not fully understood, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) is implicated in this process. PDK-1 was first identified as a protein kinase that phosphorylates a threonine residue in the kinase activation loop of Akt in a 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent manner in vitro (9Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was subsequently shown to phosphorylate and activate several members of the AGC family of protein kinases, including p70 S6K (10Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated-kinase (13Kobayashi T. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), as well as atypical PKC and novel PKC isoforms (14Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation and activation of Akt and p70 S6K normally induced by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were found not to occur in embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking the PDK-1 gene (15Williams M.R.

Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), demonstrating directly that PDK-1 plays a key role in PI3-K-mediated signaling. Despite such evidence for the function of PDK-1 in PI3-K-dependent signaling, the role of PDK-1 in the biological effects of insulin remains unclear. The insulin-induced uptake of glucose in adipocytes, which is achieved as a result of the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (16Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), is important not only for carbohydrate metabolism in these cells but also for insulin sensitivity in other organs (17Abel E.D.

Overexpression of PDK-1 was shown to stimulate translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of rat isolated adipocytes, and insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation was inhibited by a kinase-defective PDK-1 mutant and by a mutant lacking the pleckstrin homology domain of this kinase (18Bandyopadhyay G.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, these observations have been challenged by other studies showing that overexpression of wild-type, kinase-deficient, or pleckstrin homology domain-deleted mutants of PDK-1 did not affect glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes (20Yamada T. Katagiri H. Asano T. Tsuru M. Inukai K. Ono H. Kodama T. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Egawa K. Maegawa H.

Moreover, genetically engineered mice in which the activity of PDK-1 throughout the body is reduced by >80% exhibit normal activation of Akt and p70 S6K by insulin in insulin-sensitive tissues, including skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue (22Lawlor M.A. Mora A.

Disruption of the PDK-1 gene throughout the body results in embryonic death in mice (22Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To determine whether PDK-1 indeed contributes to the metabolic effects of insulin, we have therefore made use of homologous recombination to generate mice that harbor a PDK-1 gene containing LoxP sites. We have established a brown preadipocyte cell line from neonates of these “floxed” PDK-1 transgenic mice and, with the use of an adenoviral vector, introduced the Cre recombinase into brown adipocytes differentiated from this cell line in vitro. Our application of this conditional gene-targeting approach has now revealed that PDK-1 is required for insulin-induced glucose uptake.

Polyclonal antibodies to Akt phosphorylated on Thr308 or Ser473, to phospho-p70 S6K (Thr389), to p70 S6K, to phosphorylated (Thr202, Tyr204) p42 or p44 isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), to MAPK, to phosphorylated (Thr172), to phosphorylated aPKC (Thr410 and Thr403 of PKCζ and PKCλ, respectively), to phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), or to AMPK were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). A mouse monoclonal antibody to GLUT4 (1F8) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) and wortmannin were from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada) and Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), respectively.

Cell Isolation and Culture—Mice heterozygous for a floxed PDK-1 gene in which exons 3 and 4 are flanked by LoxP sequences (PDK-1 lox/+ mice) were generated by homologous recombination. 2A. Nishizawa, W. Ogawa, K. Furukawa, H. Sakaue, T. Noda, and M. Kasuga, manuscript in preparation. Breeding of the PDK-1 lox/+ animals generated mice homozygous for the floxed allele (PDK-1lox/lox) and mice homozygous for the wild-type allele (PDK-1 +/+, wild type). Brown preadipocytes were isolated from PDK-1 lox/lox and wild-type mice and immortalized essentially as described (27Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In brief, interscapular brown adipose tissue was removed from newborn mice and subjected to collagenase digestion for 30 min. The digested tissue was filtered and preadipocytes were collected by centrifugation. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml). Immortalization was performed by infection with the pBabe retroviral vector encoding SV40 T antigen and containing the puromycin resistance gene; the vector had been amplified with the plat-E retroviral packaging cell line. Cells resistant to puromycin (1 μg/ml) were selected, and the immortalized brown preadipocytes were maintained under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), referred to hereafter as culture medium. They were induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described (27Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications: The cells were grown to confluence in culture medium supplemented with 20 nm insulin and 1 nm triiodothyronine (T3), and were then incubated first for 72 h in culture medium supplemented with 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 0.5 μm dexamethasone, 0.125 mm indomethacin, 20 nm insulin, and 1 nm T3 and then for 48 h in culture medium supplemented with 20 nm insulin and 1 nm T3. The cells were then maintained in culture medium until experiments. All experiments were performed with cells subjected to <15 passages after immortalization.

Eight days after the onset of differentiation induction, immortalized brown adipocytes were infected with adenovirus vectors at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI), expressed in plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell, essentially as described (3Sakaue H.

Glucose Uptake, GLUT4 Translocation, and Immunocytofluorescence Analysis—Immortalized brown adipocytes cultured in six-well plates were assayed for insulin-induced glucose uptake by measurement of the incorporation of 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose into the cells as described previously (3Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane was measured by the plasma membrane lawn assay as described (8Kotani K. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Miyake K. Sano W. Akimoto K. Ohno S. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6971-6982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunocytofluorescence detection of phosphorylated Akt, immortalized brown adipocytes plated on glass cover slips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, washed, and incubated first with polyclonal antibodies to phospho-Akt and then with Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cover slips were mounted on glass slides and examined with a Zeiss LSM5 PASCAL confocal laser-scanning microscope. Disruption of the PDK-1 Gene with the use of an Adenoviral Vector Encoding Cre Recombinase in Immortalized Brown Adipocytes—We established immortalized brown preadipocytes derived from PDK-1 lox/lox and PDK-1 +/+ (wild type) neonates by transforming the cells with SV40 T antigen. Within 8 days after exposure to inducers of differentiation, >80% of the immortalized cells had differentiated into adipocytes, as revealed by the accumulation of lipid droplets (data not shown), consistent with previous observations (26Klein J. Fasshauer M. Klein H.H. Benito M. Kahn C.R. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Klein J. Fasshauer M. Ito M. Lowell B.B. Benito M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34795-34802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The extent of differentiation was similar for both genotypes (data not shown). To disrupt the PDK-1 gene in brown adipocytes harboring the floxed allele, we introduced Cre recombinase into the cells with the use of an adenoviral vector. Infection of the differentiated PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes with the AxCANCre vector resulted in an MOI-dependent decrease in the abundance of PDK-1 without an affect on the amount of other proteins such as Akt (Fig. 1A). At an MOI of 30 PFU/cell, the amount of PDK-1 was reduced by ∼85%. The expression of PDK-1 in wild-type adipocytes was not affected by infection with AxCANCre, indicating that the down-regulation of PDK-1 in PDK-1 lox/lox cells was not attributable to a nonspecific effect of viral infection, but rather to excision of the floxed segment of the PDK-1 gene by Cre recombinase. Inhibition of Insulin-induced Phosphorylation of Various Proteins by Depletion of PDK-1—To confirm that the disruption of the PDK-1 gene specifically prevented signaling downstream of PDK-1, we next examined the effects of insulin on the phosphorylation of various signaling molecules in the PDK-1-deficient cells with the use of antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of these proteins. Immunoblot analysis revealed that insulin induced marked phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308, a residue that is phosphorylated directly by PDK-1 (9Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in both wild-type and PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes (Fig. 1B). Infection with AxCANCre at an MOI of 30 PFU/cell almost completely inhibited the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308 in PDK-1lox/lox adipocytes but had no such effect in wild-type adipocytes. In contrast, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473, which is mediated in a PDK-1-independent manner (15Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), was not affected by infection with AxCANCre in cells of either genotype. Immunofluorescence analysis also revealed that insulin induced a pronounced increase in immunoreactivity with the antibodies to the phospho-Thr308 form of Akt in both wild-type and PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes (Fig. 1C). Infection with AxCANCre markedly reduced the effect of insulin on immunoreactivity with these antibodies in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes but not in wild-type cells. The insulin-induced increase in immunoreactivity with the antibodies to the phospho-Ser473 form of Akt was unaffected by infection with AxCANCre in cells of either genotype (Fig. 1D). PDK-1 also phosphorylates Thr229 of p70 S6K (10Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Given that antibodies specific for the phospho-Thr229 form of this kinase are not available and that prior phosphorylation of Thr229 appears to be required for phosphorylation of p70 S6K on Thr389 (11Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), we examined phosphorylation of Thr389 to monitor PDK-1 signaling to p70 S6K. The insulin-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6K on Thr389 was virtually abolished by infection with AxCANCre in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes but was unaffected in wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, although the abundance of p70 S6K was not altered, the insulin-induced shift in the electrophoretic mobility of this kinase, which reflects its phosphorylation status, was also prevented by infection with AxCANCre only in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes. PDK-1 has been shown to participate in the phosphorylation of the kinase activation loop of aPKC (30Balendran A Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of aPKC assessed by antibodies that recognize phospho-Thr410 and phospho-Thr403 forms of PKCζ and PKCλ, respectively, was slightly increased in response to insulin in both wild-type and PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes (Fig. 2B). Infection of PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes with AxCANCre reduced the phosphorylation of aPKC to the level lower than that in non-infected non-insulin treated cells. In contrast to these results, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of MAPK (Fig. 2C) and the AICAR-induced phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 2D) were not affected by infection of PDK-1 lox/lox cells with AxCANCre. These data indicate that PDK-1-dependent signaling was specifically inhibited in Cre-expressing PDK-1lox/lox cells. Inhibition of Insulin- or Myr-p110-induced, but Not AICAR-induced, Glucose Uptake, and GLUT4 Translocation by PDK-1 Depletion—Treatment with insulin resulted in a 6-7-fold increase in glucose uptake in both wild-type and PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes (Fig. 3A). Infection of PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes with AxCANCre resulted in marked inhibition of glucose uptake induced by insulin, whereas basal glucose uptake (in the absence of insulin) remained unaffected. Neither insulin-induced nor basal glucose uptake was affected by AxCANCre infection in wild-type adipocytes. To confirm that the inhibition of insulin-induced glucose uptake by AxCANCre infection in PDK-1 lox/lox cells was attributable to prevention of GLUT4 translocation, we performed the plasma membrane lawn assay. Whereas plasma membrane lawns prepared from wild-type or PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes under basal conditions showed a low level of reactivity with antibodies to GLUT4, prior treatment of the cells of either genotype with insulin resulted in a marked increase in GLUT4 immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). Infection with AxCANCre greatly inhibited the insulin-induced increase in GLUT4 immunoreactivity in the plasma membrane of PDK-1lox/lox adipocytes but had no such effect in wild-type adipocytes. These results indicate that PDK-1-dependent signaling is required for the insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and the consequent increase in glucose uptake. AICAR also stimulates glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of GLUT4 in cultured adipocytes and myotubes (31Kurth-Kraczek E.J. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Winder W.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 32Salt I.P. Connell J.M. Gould G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1649-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), an effect that is likely mediated through the activation of AMPK (33Corton J.M. Gillespie J.G. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). AICAR induced an ∼3-fold increase in glucose uptake in both wild-type and PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes (Fig. 4A), and this effect was not sensitive to wortmannin, a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3-K. AICAR-induced glucose uptake was also not inhibited by AxCANCre infection in either wild-type or PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes, consistent with the observation that AICAR-induced phosphorylation of AMPK was not affected by expression of Cre recombinase in these cells (Fig. 2C). Myr-p110, a constitutively active form of PI3-K comprising the 110-kDa catalytic subunit fused with a myristoylation signal sequence at its NH2 terminus, mimics several of the metabolic actions of insulin (4Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Kitamura T. Ueno H. Sano W. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Infection of wild-type or PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes with an adenoviral vector encoding Myr-p110 (AxCAMyr-p110) resulted in stimulation of glucose uptake to an extent similar to that observed with insulin (Fig. 4B). Glucose uptake in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes infected with both AxCAMyr-p110 and AxCANCre was greatly reduced compared with that apparent in PDK-1 lox/lox cells infected with AxCAMyr-p110 alone. In contrast, infection with AxCANCre did not affect Myr-p110-induced glucose uptake in wild-type adipocytes. These results suggest that PDK-1 contributes to glucose uptake by acting downstream of PI3-K. Disruption of the PDK-1 gene in mice results in early embryonic death (22Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), making it impossible to study the role of PDK-1 in the metabolic actions of insulin in such PDK-1 knockout animals. To clarify the contribution of PDK-1 to insulin signaling, we therefore produced mice that harbor a PDK-1 gene containing LoxP sites and established an immortalized brown preadipocyte cell line from these animals. Immortalized brown preadipocytes have previously been established from many genetically engineered mice and have proved informative in dissecting signaling pathways of adipocytes (26Klein J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), we introduced Cre recombinase into fully differentiated PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes in order to avoid complicating effects of PDK-1 depletion on the differentiation process. Disruption of the PDK-1 gene in ES cells prevented the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and p70 S6K (15Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, whereas both ES cells expressing a hypomorphic PDK-1 allele (generated by insertion of the neomycin resistance gene together with LoxP sequences in introns of the PDK-1 gene) as well as mice generated from these ES cells exhibited a >80% reduction in PDK-1 activity, the effects of insulin or IGF-1 on Akt and p70 S6K activity appeared normal in these cells and animals (22Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that cells contain an excess of PDK-1 and that a small proportion of cellular PDK-1 molecules is sufficient for effective signal transmission, at least to Akt and to p70 S6K. Infection of differentiated adipocytes derived from PDK-1lox/lox mice, but not of those from wild-type mice, with AxCANCre at an MOI of 30 PFU/cell resulted in an ∼85% reduction in the abundance of PDK-1. The insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt (on Thr308) and of p70 S6K (on Thr389) was markedly inhibited in these PDK-1-deficient cells, suggesting that infection of PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes with AxCANCre did not result in an ∼85% reduction in the amount of PDK-1 in each cell, but rather in a complete (or almost complete) loss of PDK-1 in ∼85% of the cells. Insulin-induced glucose uptake and translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane were both greatly inhibited by Cre expression in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes. Given that AICAR-induced glucose uptake was not affected by Cre expression in these cells, the inhibition of the effects of insulin was likely due to specific disruption of the insulin signaling pathway, not to impairment of the general machinery for glucose uptake. Indeed, infection of PDK-1 lox/lox cells with AxCANCre did not affect the overall abundance of GLUT4 in total cell lysates (data not shown). These results demonstrate that PDK-1 is essential for insulin-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes. Given that endogenous PDK-1 appears to be present in amounts in excess of the requirements for insulin signaling, it is not surprising that overexpression of the wild-type enzyme was previously found not to enhance insulin-induced glucose uptake (20Yamada T. Katagiri H. Asano T. Tsuru M. Inukai K. Ono H. Kodama T. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: 1385-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Egawa K. Maegawa H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38863-38869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although PDK-1 participates in a phosphorylation cascade downstream of PI3-K, the phosphorylation of p90 RSK induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which is insensitive to an inhibitor of PI3-K, was also prevented in ES cells lacking PDK-1 (15Williams M.R.

PDK-1 therefore likely contributes not only to PI3-K-dependent signaling but also to pathways that are independent of PI3-K. Furthermore, although a large body of evidence indicates that PI3-K is required for insulin-induced glucose uptake (16Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a PI3-K-independent mechanism, mediated by CAP-Cbl-TC10 signaling, also appears to contribute to this action of insulin (38Baumann C.A.

We have now shown that the stimulation of glucose uptake by a constitutively active mutant of PI3-K (Myr-p110) in PDK-1 lox/lox adipocytes was prevented by Cre expression. These data suggest that PDK-1 mediates signals to the glucose uptake machinery by acting downstream of PI3-K, but they do not exclude the possibility that PDK-1 also contributes to insulin-induced glucose uptake through a PI3-K-independent pathway. Although mutant proteins that prevent a specific signaling event, possess increased catalytic activity, or are targeted to a specific intracellular compartment have proved useful for dissecting complex signaling networks, experiments with such mutant proteins sometimes yield contradictory results (18Bandyopadhyay G.

Conditional gene disruption in cultured cells, such as that described in the present study, provides an alternative approach that circumvents many, if not all, of the limitations and problems associated with mutant protein expression.

FasΔTM, as well as transmembrane Fas antigen, can be either monomeric or oligomeric, and both its forms are efficient in blocking Fas-mediated apoptosis, although the cytotoxic activity is exhibited solely by the latter. An in vivo analysis of soluble Fas antigen showed that unlike in healthy controls, nearly the total FasΔTM present in sera of rheumatoid arthritis patients was oligomeric. This resulted in suppression of cell proliferation in the experimental sera and in its promotion in controls.

Some of these functions are realized through ligand-induced activation of transmembrane receptors with subsequent signal transduction to the receptor-expressing cell. The molecular mechanisms of this kind of transduction are well studied and described in many reviews (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Curr. Opin.

Other functions performed by the TNF receptor-ligand system are realized through the so-called “reverse signaling”, with transmembrane ligand acting as a receptor, i.e. a molecule that receives and delivers the signal, and the receptor (soluble or transmembrane) serving as a ligand, i.e. the signaling molecule.

It was shown that human recombinant soluble Fas (FasΔTM) is capable of inducing cell death by apoptosis with an efficiency dependent on the level of FasL expression on the target cells. Anti-Fas antibodies blocked FasΔTM-induced cell death. The cytotoxic activity of recombinant soluble Fas proved to result from Fas oligomerization. Moreover, soluble Fas in sera of rheumatoid arthritis patients was shown to be oligomeric. This finding suggests that in blood serum, soluble Fas antigen activity is regulated not only by the level of Fas expression but also by its oligomarization/depolymerization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Cultures and Reagents—The following cell cultures were used: human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U-937, human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells, and human Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cells. All cell lines were from Specialist collection of continuous cell lines of vertebrates (Institute of Cytology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St-Petersburg, Russia). Antibodies to Fas antigen and Fas ligand were from Bioarsenal (Moscow), to caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase from Pharmingen BD. Fas ligand exhibiting cytotoxic activity and inactive FasL-FLAG were a gift from Prof. D. Wallach.Generation of rhFasΔTM and FasFc—The cDNA fragment FasΔTM was a product of reverse transcription followed by PCR in the presence of specific primers. mRNA isolated from human HeLa cells was used as a template. The amplified cDNA FasΔTM was cloned into vector pET30b(+). Expression and purification of the protein from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were performed using the Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.The cDNA fragment Fas corresponding to amino acids 1–156 was amplified with specific primers and cloned into the vector Signal pIg-plus (Ingenius). COS-1 cells were transfected with the obtained vector, the FasFc-containing incubation medium was collected, and the protein was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ingenius).Western Blot Analysis—Protein expression was studied using cell extracts yielded by cell lysis in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml solutions of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The protein concentration was aligned according to Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis in 12% PAGE in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar), the samples were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. For immunoblotting, murine monoclonal antibodies were used as primary antibodies, and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies. The antigen-antibody complex staining was performed using the ECLplus kit or diaminobezidine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.Cytotoxic Assays—Cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (2–3×105 cells/ml). After treatment with cytotoxic agents the cells were incubated for 24 h. Viability of suspension cells was determined by staining with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45551) Google Scholar). Adherent cell viability was determined by the neutral-red uptake method (24Wallach D. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 2464-2469PubMed Google Scholar). The cell viability value was estimated as percentage of viable cells after treatment (untreated cells were taken as 100%).DNA and RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase PCR Analysis— Total DNA and RNA were isolated essentially as described earlier (25Ausubel F.M.

Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1992: 4-5-4-6Google Scholar). Expression of mRNA in the cells was determined by the reverse transcriptase PCR analysis (27Kinoshita T. Imamura J. Nagai H. Shimotohno K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The following set of primers was used (forward and reverse, respectively) to estimate gene expression: for Fas antigen, 5′-ACTGTATGTGAACACTGTGACCCT-3′ and 5′-CACTGTTTCAGGATTTAAGGTTGG-3′; for Fas ligand, 5′-AGAAGGCCTGGTCAAAGGAGGC-3′ and 5′-TTAGAGCTTATATAAGCCGAAAAACG-3′; for β-actin, 5′-TATGTGGGTGACGAGGCCCAGAG-3′ and 5′-TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC-3′.PCR products and DNA fragments of apoptotic cells were analyzed by 1% agarose or 8% acrylamide electrophoresisSerum Analysis—Blood was drawn from 28 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and from 11 healthy controls at the Moscow Medical Academy Hospital. Sera were harvested by centrifugation at 1500 × g and thereafter stored at -70 °C until further processing. A commercially available ELISA kit (Bioarsenal, Moscow, Russia) recognizing recombinant and natural sFas was used for quantification of sFas according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, serum samples were diluted 10-fold and thereafter applied to a polystyrene multiplate precoated with murine monoclonal anti-Fas antibodies 2F3. After 2 h of incubation, plates were washed and thereafter incubated with monoclonal anti-Fas antibodies 10F10 conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Staining by hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine was performed for detection of bound antibodies and their subsequent quantifying with a microtiter plate reader at 490 nm. Standard curves were constructed using serial dilutions of recombinant sFas. Each serum sample was tested in triplicate.Gel Filtration of sFas—Samples of FasΔTM or serum were applied to Toyopearl HW-55 or Superose 12 gel filtration columns using fast protein liquid chromatography equipment. The columns were equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The absorption of the eluent was monitored at 280 nm. Fractions were collected, and the amount of sFas was determined by sandwich-ELISA (see above). Molecular masses were determined by comparison with a standard curve of cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and dextran blue.RESULTSCytotoxic Activity of Soluble Fas Antigen—In the cell, there are transmembrane and soluble forms of Fas (28Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 29Liu C. Cheng J. Mountz J.D. Biochem.

Among the latter, the highest expression is characteristic of FasΔTM (generated by alternative splicing of the intact exon 6) that encodes the Fas transmembrane domain. For the purpose of cloning, FasΔTM mRNA isolated from HeLa cells was used. The recombinant protein was expressed and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in accordance with the instructions by equipment manufacturers.The molecular mass of FasΔTM isolated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was about 40 kDa, and it could be recognized by specific anti-Fas antibodies (Fig. 1A).When added to various human cell cultures, FasΔTM exhibited the cytotoxic activity (Fig. 1B) to which the cells were sensitive to a variable degree. Antibodies to the extracellular, but not intracellular, portion of Fas blocked the FasΔTM-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 1C), thereby demonstrating specificity of FasΔTM as a cell killer.No effect of FasΔTM on cell distribution over the cell cycle phases was observed (data not shown). As revealed by Western blotting and analysis of DNA from apoptotic cells, FasΔTM induced cell death by apoptosis (Fig. 2A). Caspase-3 that was formed in the cells 4 h after treatment cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase to trigger internucleosome fragmentation of the DNA (31Kawahara A. Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, prior to the DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells, FasL expression decreased with increasing amount of Fas mRNA (Fig. 2B). Because inhibition of RNA synthesis by actinomycin D enhances FasΔTM-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B), it can be believed that a change in expression of FasL and Fas mRNA is a protective response to the treatment by target cells.Fig. 2Rh FasΔTM induces cell death by apoptosis. A, Western blotting analysis of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation as assayed by electrophoresis. HeLa cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml rhFasΔTM for the indicated time. B, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of Fas and Fas ligand mRNA expression in HeLa cells treated with 2 μg/ml rhFasΔTM for the indicated time. The bottom panel shows β-actin-specific nucleic acid fragments, the level of which was determined as a control for reverse transcriptase-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A reason for variable degrees of FasΔTM sensitivity shown by cell cultures could lie in different levels of expression of acceptor molecules mediating the action of FasΔTM. Among potential FasΔTM targets, there could be FasL, Fas receptor, or probably other proteins (30Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G.m Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar, 32Papoff G. Hausler P. Eramo A. Pagano M.G. Di Leve G. Signore A. Ruberti G. J. Biol.

An analysis of expression of FasL and Fas receptor in the studied cell cultures showed that the level of expression of Fas antigen was nearly the same in all the samples, whereas FasL expression was higher in HeLa and U-937 cells as compared with Raji (Fig. 3A). However, HeLa and U-937 cells were more sensitive to FasΔTM cytotoxicity than Raji cells (Fig. 1B). To verify the correlation between the FasL expression level and efficiency of FasΔTM-induced cell death, FasΔTM cytotoxicity was assayed using HeLa cells transiently transfected with FasL cDNA-bearing vector in the antisense orientation. As found, inhibition of FasL expression led to an increased cell resistance against FasΔTM (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3rhFasΔTM induces cell death through reverse signaling via Fas ligand. A, Western blotting analysis of Fas and Fas ligand proteins in HeLa, U-937, and Raji cells. B, HeLa cells transfected with “empty” vector (•) and with pcDNA3 bearing Fas ligand cDNA in the antisense orientation (clones 1 (▴) and 2 (▪) were incubated with the indicated concentrations of FasΔTM for 24 h). Cell viability was determined by the neutral-red assay. The results are presented as mean ± S.E. of triplicate cultures of three experiments. C, assay for rhFasΔTM binding specificity. rhFasΔTM was incubated with HeLa cell lysate (lane 1), and the obtained complexes were precipitated using FasΔTM-binding resin. The pellet was washed with buffer (lane 2) and eluted using imidazole buffer (lane 3). FasΔTM-binding resin incubated with HeLa cell lysate in the absence FasΔTM was washed with buffer and eluted using imidazole buffer too (lane 4). The obtained samples were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies to Fas ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A direct evidence for FasL contribution to FasΔTM-induced cell death came from an analysis of the specificity of interactions between recombinant FasΔTM and Fas ligand. In the experiment, protein extracts of FasΔTM-sensitive cell cultures passed through a FasΔTM-containing column. After eluting, the FasΔTM-bound proteins were subjected to Western blotting with specific anti-FasL antibodies (Fig. 3C). FasL was detected in the protein fraction bound to FasΔTM. Hence, the obtained FasΔTM was able to bind FasL.Taken together, these results suggest that it is FasL that serves as a target for FasΔTM.Oligomerization of Soluble Fas Antigen—Further studies of the FasΔTM sample showed that after its separation by gel filtration, the protein was contained by the fraction corresponding to a molecular mass of about 150 kDa (Fig. 4). This demonstrated the ability of FasΔTM to be oligomeric, which was in good agreement with earlier findings by other researchers (32Papoff G. Hausler P. Eramo A. Pagano M.G. Di Leve G. Signore A. Ruberti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38241-38250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Siegel R.M. Frederiksen J.K. Zacharias D.A. Chan F.K. Johnson M. Lynch D. Tsien R.Y. Lenardo M.J. Science. 2000; 288: 2354-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that only samples containing a high molecular fraction of FasΔTM displayed the FasΔTM cytotoxic activity.Fig. 4Active rhFasΔTM is oligomeric. A, samples of cytotoxically active (solid line) and inactive (dashed line) rhFasΔTM were separated using a column with Toyopearl HW-55. The absorption of the eluent was monitored at 280 nm. The collected fractions were assayed for the presence of rhFasΔTM by Western blotting with anti-Fas antibodies. B shows the results for fractions 8, 12, and 16 yielded by separation of active rhFasΔTM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To verify the suggestion that the cytotoxic activity of FasΔTM depends on its oligomerization, we used FasFc, a COS cell-derived combination of the extracellular portion of Fas and the Fc fragment of human IgG. When added to cell cultures, FasFc exhibited no notable cytotoxicity, although its cross-linking with the use of anti-Fc antibodies induced cell death (Fig. 5A). Note that both monomeric and cross-linked FasFc efficiently blocked Fas ligand-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Thus, interactions of both cross-linked FasFc and recombinant oligomeric FasΔTM with transmembrane Fas ligand induce apoptosis of target cells. Binding of both oligomeric and monomeric Fas to soluble Fas ligand suppresses the cytotoxic activity of the latter.Fig. 5Cross-linked FasFc, but not monomeric FasFc, induces cell death. A, HeLa cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of FasFc in the absence (filled bars) or presence (hatched bars) of anti-Fc antibodies for 24 h. The cytotoxic activity of anti-Fc antibodies alone is shown as open bars. Cell death was determined by the neutral-red assay. The results are given as percentage of dead cells against the entire cell population. Error bars represent S.D. values of data from three independent experiments. B, monomeric and cross-linked FasFc suppress FasL-dependent cell death. HeLa cells were incubated with soluble FasL (1 μg/ml) alone (open bars), with 2.5 μg/ml monomeric or cross-linked FasFc (hatched bars), or with soluble FasL combined with 2.5 μg/ml monomeric or cross-linked FasFc (filled bars) for 24 h. Cell death was determined by the neutral-red assay. Error bars represent S.D. values of data from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Thus, cytotoxicity of FasΔTM comes from its oligomerization. The reasons for FasΔTM oligomerization are still unclear. It may be believed that spontaneous self-association of FasΔTM results from interactions between CRD1/PLAD regions of the extracellular portion of Fas and/or the “death domains” of the Fas intracellular region at high concentrations of FasΔTM (33Siegel R.M.

Specifically, a high concentration of soluble Fas was reported for blood drawn from patients with autoimmune disease (36Jodo S. Kobayashi S. Kayagaki N. Ogura N. Feng Y. Amasaki Y. Fujisaku A. Azuma M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Koike T. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 107: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 37Hasunuma T. Kayagaki N. Asahara H. Motokawa S. Kobata T. Yagita H. Aono H. Sumida T. Okumura K. Nishioka K. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to be characterized by a higher concentration of soluble Fas in the blood of a patient, a question arises as to whether Fas is monomeric or oligomeric in sera from RA patients. For this purpose, the sera were separated by gel filtration, and the obtained fractions were assayed for the Fas presence using sandwich ELISA.In RA sera with 3–5-fold Fas expression (up to 10 ng/ml) as compared with controls, the major part of Fas antigen was found to belong to high molecular fractions with a molecular mass of 150–200 kDa (Fig. 6A). Confirmation of the presence of Fas antigen in these fractions came from their immunoprecipitation with anti-Fas antibodies (Fig. 6B). In healthy controls, no soluble Fas was detected in high molecular fractions, and no other Fas but monomeric was observed (data not shown). However, it cannot be ruled out that this was a result of a low concentration of the receptor.Fig. 6Soluble Fas from RA patients is oligomeric and determines the anti-proliferation activity of host sera. A, samples (100 μl) of sera from RA patients 2-fold diluted with phosphate-buffered saline were applied to a Superose 12 gel filtration column. The absorption of the eluent was monitored at 280 nm (solid line). Fractions were collected, and the elution of sFas was determined by sandwich ELISA (dashed line). The inset shows the results of Western blotting with anti-Fas antibodies for fractions 15 and 30 yielded by RA serum separation. B, HeLa cells were incubated with 20% solutions of sera from RA patients (columns 1–3) and from healthy donors (columns 4–6) in the absence (open bars) or presence (filled bars) of non-cytotoxic FasL-FLAG for 24 h. Cell proliferation was determined by the neutral-red assay. Typical results of one of the four experiments are presented.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since oligomeric recombinant Fas exhibited the cytotoxic activity, we assayed some sera containing oligomeric soluble Fas at high concentrations (6–10 ng/ml) for such an activity. As was expected, addition of 20% healthy control to HeLa cell culture resulted in a higher proliferation of the cells. Note that non-cytotoxic FasL-FLAG capable of interacting with Fas produced no effect on the proliferation-stimulating activity of normal sera (Fig. 6C). Unlike cultivation with controls, that with RA sera containing soluble Fas at a high concentration resulted in a suppressed proliferation of HeLa cells, and the cytotoxicity was notably down-regulated by FasL-FLAG. Hence, cytotoxicity of RA sera is determined, at least partially, by oligomeric soluble Fas antigen. Besides, the suppression of proliferation of transformed cells by sera from autoimmune disease patients suggests that Fas is a key signaling molecule providing a link between cancero- and autoimmune genesis.DISCUSSIONHere we report that (a) FasΔTM is capable of inducing death of transformed cells; (b) in vivo there exists oligomeric soluble Fas antigen, e.g. in RA sera; and (c) cytotoxicity of soluble Fas antigen results from its oligomerization.We believe that FasΔTM cytotoxicity is indicative of a novel functional role of soluble Fas antigen. Taken together, the literature data and our results suggest that functionally, soluble Fas antigen not only inhibits Fas ligand cytotoxicity and hence, Fas-mediated apoptosis (28Cheng J. Zhou T.

Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar), but also triggers cell death through reverse signaling via transmembrane Fas ligand. This requires more attention to the cases of higher expression of soluble Fas with distinction as to its apoptosis-inhibiting and apoptosis-stimulating activities. Specifically, inhibition of apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes by soluble FasL in hepatocellular carcinoma patients described by Nakamoto et al. (38Nakamoto Y. Kaneko S. Buttner S.W. Matsushita E. Kobayashi K. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 733-739PubMed Google Scholar) may be a result of neutralization of cytotoxic soluble Fas antigen whose high level of expression in hepatocellular carcinoma samples has been reliably documented (39Lee S.H.

However, the specific mechanisms responsible for these events remain elusive. A screen designed to identify trans-acting factors involved in these mechanisms in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified a temperature-sensitive mutant that displayed phenotypes consistent with a role in transcription termination. The complementing gene was identified as GRS1, which encodes the S. cerevisiae glycyl-tRNA synthetase. This result, although unusual, is not unprecedented given that the involvement of tRNA synthetases in a variety of cellular processes other than translation has been well established. A direct role for the synthetase in transcription termination was determined through several in vitro assays using purified wild type and mutant enzyme. First, binding to two well characterized yeast mRNA 3′ ends was demonstrated by cross-linking studies. In addition, it was found that all three substrates compete with each other for binding to GlyRS enzyme. Next, the affinity of the synthetase for the two mRNA 3′ ends was found to be similar to that of its “natural” substrate, glycine tRNA in a nitrocellulose filter binding assay. The effect of the grs1-1 mutation was also examined and found to significantly reduce the affinity of the enzyme for the three RNA substrates. Taken together, these data indicate that not only does this synthetase interact with several different RNA substrates, but also that these substrates bind to the same site. These results establish a direct role for GRS1 in mRNA 3′ end formation. Transcription termination and 3′ end formation are essential processes necessary for gene expression.

Taken together, these data indicate that not only does this synthetase interact with several different RNA substrates, but also that these substrates bind to the same site. These results establish a direct role for GRS1 in mRNA 3′ end formation. The formation of a eukaryotic mRNA 3′ end is a complex process involving factors that recognize, cleave, and process the pre-mRNA as well as those that facilitate the dissociation of RNA polymerase II from the DNA template. Although many of these factors have been identified, a comprehensive model of how the termination event interfaces with the processing activities remains elusive. The favored model suggests that termination is dependent on the recognition of a polyadenylation signal that then triggers a change in the polymerase, resulting in dissociation of the enzyme, followed by the termination event(s) (1Orozco I.J. Kim S.J. Martinson H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42899-42911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The most likely alteration in the actively transcribing enzyme would be a result of the “offloading” of 3′ end processing factors that associate with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNAP II. 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase.1The abbreviations used are: RNAP II, RNA polymerase II; GlyRS, glycyl-tRNA synthetase. In addition to factors involved in RNA processing interacting with the transcription machinery, recent data demonstrate that transcription factors may also be part of the polyadenylation machinery (2Takahashi A. Sasaki H. Kim S. Tobisu K. Kakizoe T. Tsukamoto T. Kumamoto Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4233-4237PubMed Google Scholar, 3Howe K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 308-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, this apparent cross-talk of both complexes reinforces the notion that the transcription and processing reactions are tightly coupled in vivo.The requirement for coordination of termination and processing suggests the involvement of additional factors that are likely to influence one or both events. As noted, changes to the polymerase, including dephosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain are likely to influence the processivity of the enzyme (4Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In addition, there may be other termination factors that either (i) directly alter the actively transcribing complex to elicit dissociation from the template or (ii) are involved in alternative mechanisms to promote termination, such as chromatin remodeling (5Alen C. Kent N.A. Jones H.S. O'Sullivan J. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For example, mutations in a proly isomerase gene, ESS1, have resulted in defects in transcription termination (6Morris D.P. Phatnani H.P. Greenleaf A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31583-31587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The termination region may also have inherent properties that contribute to the termination event, as indicated by the fact that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNAP II elongation complex, like those of Escherichia coli, are destabilized an RNA hairpin structure (7Komissarova N. Becker J. Solter S. Kireeva M. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Finally, co-transcriptional cleavage at the poly(A) site does not seem to be an absolute requirement for termination (8Osheim Y. Proudfoot N. Beyer A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Tran D.P. Kim S.J. Park N.J. Jew T.M. Martinson H.G. Mol. Cell.

Chromosoma. 2002; 111: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that while passage through the poly(A) site may affect the processivity of the enzyme, it does not dissociate from the complex until it is well past the poly(A) site.While transcription complexes as well as cleavage and polyadenylation reactions can be reconstituted from purified components, the complexity of factors suggests the possibility of additional interactions in vivo. Further attempts to define the mechanism of transcription termination have led to the identification of additional interactions between components of the transcriptional machinery as well as the involvement of unexpected trans-acting factors. One such factor, the S. cerevisiae GRS1 gene, was identified in a genetic screen for mutations that cause RNAP II to read through an otherwise functional 3′ end signal (11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar). GRS1 encodes both the cytoplasmic and mitrochondrial glycyl-tRNA synthetase (12Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Cells containing only the grs1-1 allele display both a termination defect and a slow growth phenotype at the non-permissive temperature. The grs1-1 mutation was identified as a proline to phenylalanine change at amino acid 552, located in the COOH-terminal domain of the protein (11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar).That a tRNA synthetase can function in an activity distinct from its role in translation is not unprecedented, as tRNA synthetases have been shown to be present in the nucleus and to bind substrates other than their cognate tRNA (13Lund E. Dahlberg J. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Martinis S.A. Plateau P. Cavarelli J. Florentz C.

Further support for the notion that the synthetase may participate in interactions with the 3′ end of mRNAs was demonstrated by the presence of putative tRNA-like structures at the 3′ end of several yeast mRNAs (11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar). Again, this is not an uncommon finding as a tRNA-like motif is a common structure found in different types of RNA as a regulatory element (16Gallie D.R. Walbot V. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 17Pan T. Gutell R. Uhlenbeck O. Science. 1991; 254: 1361-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We carried out a series of experiments to elucidate the role of GRS1 in transcription termination. The 3′ end signals from two yeast genes were examined and found to interact directly and specifically with GlyRS in vitro, indicating that GlyRS may play a direct role in promoting efficient termination of transcription. In addition, GlyRS-P552F was found to have a reduced affinity for its cognate tRNA as well as the two other RNA substrates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Culture and media components were obtained from Difco.

Briefly, two oligonucleotides (LEH 418, LEH 419) were annealed and ligated into the KpnI/EcoRI sites of Yep181/GRS1 and Yep181/grs1-1.pBEVY/GRS1(His6) and pBEVY/grs1-1(His6) were constructed by amplifying the His6-GRS1 and His6-grs1-1 genes from Yep181/GRS1-1(His6) and Yep181/grs1-1(His6), respectively, using primers LEH 510/LEH 511. The resulting products were digested and cloned into the BamHI/PstI sites of pBEVY-Leu.pD16tRNAGly was generated by first annealing two oligonucleotides (LEH 506, LEH 507) to create the DNA sequence encoding S. cerevisiae glycyl-tRNA flanked by KpnI and SalI sites. The resulting product was ligated into the KpnI/SalI sites of pT7T319u to give pT7T3 tRNAGly. This plasmid was then digested with SmaI/SphI and ligated into D16.ADH2(G18A) was amplified from T7T3ADH2(G18A) using primers LEH 482/LEH 106 and subcloned into the KpnI/XhoI sites of D16. A similar procedure was followed using T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A) and T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G) as template with primers LEH 497/LEH 498 to create pD16ADH2(G18A,G19A) and pD16ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G) respectively.Yeast Strains and Methods—All strains used are derivatives of W303, and yeast cells were cultured using standard techniques (23Sherman F.

Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar).Yeast strains used for protein expression and purification are haploid derivatives of a grs1Δ/GRS1 strain (11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar). The grs1Δ//GRS1 strain was transformed with pBEVY/GRS1(His6) and sporulated. This procedure was repeated with pBEVY/grs1-1(His6) to generate the strains grs1Δ/pBEVY/GRS1(His6) and grs1Δ/pBEVY/grs1-1(His6).Protein Purification—The purification procedure for GlyRS was modified from (12Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). His6-GlyRS and His6-GlyRS-P552F were purified from yeast cells using nickel-nitriloacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted with buffer containing 20 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole.Active Site Assay—Isolation of the E-[Gly.AMP] product was performed as modified from (26Austin J. First E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). His6-GlyRS was incubated with excess MgATP and [U-14C]glycine in buffer A (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 50 μl. The resulting protein complex was isolated on 0.45-μ HA-type nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) and washed with buffer B (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl). The filters were dried and added to 10 ml of scintillation mixture (Sigma) for counting. To determine the total cpm added, 5 μl of each reaction was spotted on a dry filter and counted. For each sample, cpm bound was converted to μmol of bound glycine (8.9E07 cpm = 1 μmol of glycine).Aminoacylation Assay—A standard aminoacylation assay was performed as modified from (27Kern D. Dietrich A. Fasiolo F Renaud M. Giege R. Ebel J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1977; 59: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). His6-GlyRS was incubated in buffer A with the addition of 200 μm total yeast tRNA (Sigma) in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and then spotted on Whatman No. 3MM filter paper. The filters were washed first in 300 ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min, followed by two washes in 300 ml cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min, and finally a 2-min wash in 100% EtOH. The filters were dried and added to a 10-ml scintillation mixture for counting. The total cpm added was determined as described above. Cpm bound was converted to μmol of tRNA charged for each sample (9.6E07 cpm = 1 μmol of charged tRNA).RNA Synthesis—The template for tRNAGly was prepared by PCR, using the primers LEH 563/LEH 564 on D16tRNAGly to generate T7-tRNAGly. T7-CYC1 and T7-cyc-512 were generated in a similar manner using primers LEH 546/LEH 547 on pGCYC1 and pGcyc-512, respectively. Digesting T7T3ADH2 and T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G) with NheI generated the T7 template for ADH2 and ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G), respectively.Transcription reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Labeled transcripts were purified using P-30 Micro Bio Spin columns (Bio-Rad). Unlabeled transcripts were first digested with 10 units of DNase for 30 min at 37 °C before precipitation.Cross-linking—20 nm RNA was incubated with 1 nm His6-GlyRS for 10 min at 30 °C in a buffer C (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mg/ml salmon sperm). Reactions were UV cross-linked at 120 mJ for 90 s and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Competition assays were performed by preincubating the protein with varying amounts of unlabeled RNA for 10 min at 30 °C before adding labeled RNA. The cross-linking reaction was then continued as described above. All cross-linking gels were dried and exposed to film (Fuji).Filter Binding—Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were based on a previously described method (28Carey J. Lowary P. Uhlenbeck O. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4723-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 nm His6-GlyRS was incubated with varying amounts of RNA at 30 °C for 10 min in buffer C, with the addition of 40 units of RNasin, in a total volume of 50 μl. Reactions were filtered through a presoaked 0.45-μ HA-type nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and washed with 5 ml of buffer B. Filters were dried and counted. Total cpm added was determined as described above. The amount of bound RNA in each reaction was determined by comparing the amount of cpm bound to the total cpm present in each reaction. Points used to generate binding curves were the average of three independent experiments. Binding curves were fit to a quadratic equation (F = (A/E)*((E + X + K)2 - ((E + X + K)2) - (4* E * X))0.5)/2 with E = 1) using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). The dissociation constant (K d) is the concentration at which 50% of the RNA bound at saturation is retained on the filter.Site-directed Mutagenesis—T7T3AHD2(G18A), T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A), and T7T3ADH2 (G18A,G19A,C101G) were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange kit. Primers LEH 426/LEH 427 were used in a mutagenic PCR reaction with T7T3ADH2 to generate T7T3ADH2(G18A). Primers LEH 477/LEH 478 were used with template T7T3ADH2(G18A) to generate T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A), which was then used as template with LEH 252/LEH 509 to generate T7T3ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G). Mutations in ADH2 were confirmed by DNA sequencing.RESULTSPurification and Characterization of GlyRS and GlyRS-P552F—To examine the interaction of GlyRS with the 3′ end of mRNA, it was first necessary to obtain active protein to use in the in vitro assays. The addition of a His6 tag to the COOH-terminal domain of GlyRS and GlyRS-P552F proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”) facilitated purification from yeast cells. The addition of the COOH-terminal His6 tag does not interfere with the function of the enzyme (12Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and His6-GlyRS is able to complement the growth defect of the grs1-1 strain (data not shown). The purified enzymes were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomasie stain (Fig. 1A). The yield for each purification was determined by comparing the intensity of the GlyRS band with a known quantity of bovine serum albumin run on the same gel. The calculated yield was then verified by measuring the OD280 of the GlyRS fraction. Activity of the purified His6-GlyRS and His6-GlyRS-P552F proteins was then determined by testing the ability of the enzyme to carry out both steps of the two-part aminoacylation reaction (Fig. 1, B and C). First, the ability of His6-GlyRS to form the glycine-AMP intermediate was determined through an active site assay (26Austin J. First E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14812-14820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of GlyRS and GlyRS-P552F bind similar amounts of glycine in an ATP-dependent manner, indicating that both enzymes are functional (Fig. 1B). The amount of glycine bound can then be used to calculate the amount of active protein in each reaction assuming each monomer of GlyRS binds one molecule of glycine. The amount of active protein was compared with the total yield and both GlyRS and GlyRS-P552F preparations were found to contain 90% active protein. The active site assay was also performed with a protein extract made from cells transformed with empty vector (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and, as expected, does not have a significant amount of glycine binding activity (Fig. 1B).Next the full aminoacylation reaction was performed (Fig. 1C). Due to differences in the concentration of the enzymes, the amount of tRNA charged in each assay was normalized to the amount of active protein added to the reaction (as determined from the active site assay). After a 20-min incubation, the GlyRS reaction produced an increased amount of charged tRNA as compared with the mutant. These data establish that both the His6-GlyRS and His6-GlyRS-P552F proteins are active in vitro, although GlyRS-P552F is less efficient at charging tRNA.GlyRS Protein Cross-links Directly to the 3′ End of ADH2 and CYC1—To explore the mechanism by which GlyRS is involved in transcription termination, His6-GlyRS was examined for its ability to interact directly with the 3′ end of yeast mRNAs through UV cross-linking. The ADH2 and CYC1 sequences are well characterized with regard to 3′ end formation (29Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 30Chen, S. (1998) Characterization of Cis-acting Elements and Trans-acting Factors Involved in mRNA 3′ End Formation in the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis, Tulane University, New OrleansGoogle Scholar). The region of ADH2 and CYC1 proceeding the poly(A) site (160 and 150 bp, respectively) was transcribed in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and cross-linked to GlyRS. In addition, a mutant of the CYC1 3′ end, cyc-512, was also tested. The cyc-512 3′ end contains a 38-bp deletion and is unable to direct proper transcription termination (29Zaret K.S. Sherman F. Cell. 1982; 28: 563-573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The known substrate of GlyRS, tRNAGly, was also tested in the cross-linking assay to determine the effectiveness of the assay. For each sample, the reaction was cross-linked in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 1 nm GlyRS. A cross-linked product can be seen only in the presence of the GlyRS protein, which cross-links to its own tRNA as well as to the 3′ end of ADH2 and CYC1 (Fig. 2). The migration of these products is consistent with the expected size of in a SDS-PAGE gel of a GlyRS-RNA cross-link. For example, the cross-link product observed with tRNAGly migrates at about 100 kDa, which is consistent with the molecular mass of a GlyRS monomer (72 kDa) plus the RNA (28 kDa) (Fig. 2A). The ADH2 (Fig. 2B) and CYC1 (Fig. 2C) RNAs migrate at 53 and 50 kDa, respectively, and the resulting cross-link products migrate above the 120-kDa marker, which is also consistent with a 72-kDa increase. The cross-link products are specific as they are not observed with a version of the ADH2 3′ end containing three point mutations or with the substrate cyc-512 (Fig. 2, B and C). GlyRS was also unable to cross-link to the ADH2 complement sequence (data not shown).Fig. 2GlyRS cross-links to the 3′ end of mRNA. His6-GlyRS was incubated with labeled tRNAGly (A) or the 3′ ends of ADH2 (B) and CYC1 (C). The reactions were subjected to UV cross-linking and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Each reaction contains 1 nm protein and 20 nm labeled RNA. Cross-linking reactions were performed in the absence (-) or presence (+) of GlyRS. Protein-RNA complexes are visible only in the presence of GlyRS and are indicated by the top arrow (*). Unbound RNA is indicated by the bottom arrow. A mutated ADH2 3′ end (B) as well as a deletion mutant of CYC1, cyc-512 (C), are unable to produce a cross-link product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Sequences in the ADH2 3′ End Are Important for the GlyRS Interaction—A previous study identified tRNA-like structures at the 3′ end of several yeast mRNAs (11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A illustrates this potential structure in the ADH2 3′ end. Although the validity of these structures has not been tested, this region was found to interact directly with GlyRS (Fig. 2). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to further explore the importance of this 3′ end region to the GlyRS interaction.Fig. 3Mutations in the tRNA like structure of ADH2 inhibit GlyRS binding. A, a graphic representation of the potential tRNA like structure of the ADH2 3′ end as modified from Ref. 11Magrath C. Hyman L. Genetics. 1999; 152: 129-141PubMed Google Scholar. Regions modified through site-directed mutagenesis are indicated by the circles (G18, G19, and C101). B, mutations in the ADH2 3′ end increase transcriptional readthrough as measured by a reporter assay. Wild type and mutant ADH2 3′ ends were cloned into the D16 plasmid and transformed into W303. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the following mutants: G18A, G18A,G19A, and G18A,G19A,C101G. The presence of a functional termination signal prevented transcription of the lacZ gene and downstream β-galactosidase expression. After growth in galactose containing medium, β-galactosidase levels were measured to determine percent readthrough as compared with empty vector (100%). The triple mutant (G18A,G19A,C101G) demonstrated the highest percent readthrough as compared with wild type ADH2. C, the ADH2 triple mutant is unable to compete with wild type ADH2 for GlyRS binding. 1 nm GlyRS was preincubated with 0.200 μm (lanes 1 and 4), 2.0 μm (lanes 2 and 5), and 20 μm (lanes 3 and 6) unlabeled ADH2 (left) or ADH2(G18A,G19A,C101G) (right) for 10 min at 30 °C before adding 20 nm labeled ADH2. Reactions were then UV cross-linked and resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The top arrow indicates cross-linked complexes; the bottom arrow indicates unbound, labeled ADH2. At the highest concentration of competitor, wild type ADH2 is able to compete for binding, while the triple mutant is not (compare lanes 3 and 6, top arrow).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The mutated versions of the ADH2 3′ end were cloned into a reporter construct (Fig. 3B) (18Hyman L.E. Seiler S.H. Whoriskey J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2004-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that measures the efficiency of a particular sequence to direct transcription termination. Normal termination results in a truncated transcript with no β-galactosidase expression, while defective termination leads to readthrough into the lacZ gene and expression of β-galactosidase. The effect of each of the ADH2 mutations on termination efficiency was measured by comparing the β-galactosidase activity for each construct and expressed as percent readthrough as compared with the reporter lacking a terminator sequence (100% readthrough). The C101G mutation increases readthrough by more than 6-fold as compared with the wild type ADH2 3′ end (22Magrath, C. (1999) The Role of GRS1 in Transcription Termination by RNA Polymerase II. Ph.D. thesis, Tulane University, New OrleansGoogle Scholar). Additional mutations in the first half of this region (G18A and G18A,G19A) did not increase transcriptional readthrough significantly. However, a construct containing all three mutations increased the level of readthrough to almost twice that of the C101G mutation alone, indicating that this region of the ADH2 3′ end is important for normal transcription termination (Fig. 3B).To determine whether the decrease in termination efficiency seen in the in vivo assay co"

The hydrophobic fluorescent probe 1,1′-bis(anilino)-4,4′-bis(naphthalene)-8,8′-disulfonate (bis-ANS) was found to be a potent inhibitor of LPL. ApoCII prevented the inhibition by bis-ANS, and was also able to restore the activity of inhibited LPL in a competitive manner, but only with triacylglycerols with acyl chains longer than three carbons. Studies of fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance indicated that LPL has an exposed hydrophobic site for binding of bis-ANS. The high affinity interaction was characterized by an equilibrium constant Kd of 0.10–0.26 μm and by a relatively high on rate constant k ass = 2.0 × 104m–1 s–1 and a slow off-rate with a dissociation rate constant k diss = 1.2 × 10–4 s–1. The high affinity binding of bis-ANS did not influence interaction of LPL with heparin or with lipid/water interfaces and did not dissociate the active LPL dimer into monomers. Analysis of fragments of LPL after photoincorporation of bis-ANS indicated that the high affinity binding site was located in the middle part of the N-terminal folding domain. We propose that bis-ANS binds to an exposed hydrophobic area that is located close to the active site. This area may be the binding site for individual substrate molecules and also for apoCII.

The enzyme is bound to heparan sulfate proteoglycans at the vascular endothelium and hydrolyzes triacylglycerols and phospholipids in plasma lipoproteins so that lipolysis products can be taken up in adjacent cells for metabolic purposes. In addition and independent of catalysis, the LPL protein functions as a mediator for binding and uptake of lipoproteins by cells by bridging between the lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans or receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family.LPL belongs to the family of mammalian triglyceride lipases together with pancreatic lipase, hepatic lipase, and endothelial lipase (2Wong H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Based on sequence homology with pancreatic lipase, models of the 55-kDa subunit of LPL have been created (4van Tilbeurgh H. Roussel A. Lalouel J.-M. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4626-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi Y. Nakajima T. Inoue I. Eur. J.

A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LPL can engage in a number of interactions with heparin/heparan sulfate, receptors, lipid/water interfaces, the activator apolipoprotein CII (apoCII), and perhaps with other apolipoproteins. Fatty acids with long acyl chains have been shown to bind to LPL with high affinity (10Edwards K. Chan R.Y.S. Sawyer W.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13304-13311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and to inhibit the catalytic activity of LPL as well as binding of LPL to lipid/water interfaces (lipoproteins, emulsion droplets) (11Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and to heparin (12Peterson J. Bihain B.E. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Deckelbaum R.J. Carpentier Y.A. Olivecrona T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, fatty acids exert strong control over the activity of LPL. Their removal by uptake in tissues or by binding to albumin is essential to allow the action of the enzyme to proceed unabated.ApoCII, a 79-amino acid residue peptide belonging to the apoC family of exchangeable apolipoproteins, is a necessary activator for LPL in vivo (13LaRosa J.C. Levy R.I. Herbert P. Lux S.E. Fredrickson D.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 41: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 14Narayanaswami V. Ryan R.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Deficiency of apoCII leads to massive accumulation of lipids in blood and symptoms similar to what is seen on LPL deficiency (15Breckenridge W.C. Little J.A. Steiner G. Chow A. Poapst M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Systematic mutagenesis of residues in the LPL binding domain of apoCII and studies of the three-dimensional structure of apoCII by NMR strongly suggest that the basis for the activation is formation of a complex between apoCII and LPL at the surface of a lipid droplet (16Shen Y. Lookene A. Nilsson S. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4334-4342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Zdunek J. Martinez G.V. Schleucher J. Lycksell P.O. Yin Y. Nilsson S. Shen Y. Olivecrona G. Wijmenga S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1872-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the region of apoCII responsible for the interaction with LPL has been localized to the C-terminal part of the peptide (18Kinnunen P.K.J. Jackson R.L. Smith L.C. Gotto Jr., A.M. Sparrow J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4848-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), it is still unclear which part(s) of LPL interacts with apoCII. From studies of chimeras of LPL with the related hepatic lipase it has been concluded that apoCII may interact across the anti-parallel LPL dimer with binding sites both on the N-terminal and C-terminal folding domains of LPL (19Hill J.S.

By computer modeling of the molecular docking of a C-terminal fragment of apoCII, spanning residues 50–79, to the LPL monomer, the binding site(s) for apoCII was suggested to be located at the interface between the N-terminal and C-terminal folding domains of LPL and also engaging the lid region that covers the active site (6Razzaghi H. Day B.W. McClure R.J. Kamboh M.I. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2001; 19: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A different interaction site was recently reported by McIlhargey et al. (20McIlhargey T.T. Yang Y. Wong H. Hill J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23027-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) based on experiments with cross-linking and mutagenesis. They proposed that LPL residues 65–68 and 73–79 are involved in the activation by apoCII. In the model of LPL these residues are part of a helix located in close proximity to the active site pocket.The molecular mechanism for the activation of LPL by apoCII is still unresolved. Both proteins bind independently to lipid droplets (21Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22McLean L.R. Jackson R.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4196-4201Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, apoCII is not needed for interfacial binding of LPL. ApoCII has effects on LPL activity only with triacylglycerols and phospholipids that contain acyl chains longer than seven carbons (23Rapp D. Olivecrona T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Shinomiya M. Jackson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The level to which apoCII activates LPL in vitro depends not only on the substrate molecules but also on components like surfactants and other proteins that are present in the system (21Bengtsson G. Olivecrona T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The conditions when apoCII has effects on LPL activity, i.e. in the presence of emulsified lipids, are not easily compatible with biophysical techniques for studies of protein structure and interactions. Therefore, most information comes from indirect studies of enzyme kinetics and from studies of mutants of apoCII and LPL.In the present study we have used the aromatic hydrophobic probes 1,1′-bis(anilino)-4,4′-bis(naphthalene)-8,8′-disulfonate (bis-ANS), 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS), and triiodothyronine (T3) to investigate the mechanism of LPL action. Bis-ANS and ANS are often used as sensitive probes to detect hydrophobic sites and conformational changes in proteins (26Primm T.P. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 281-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Chatterjee S. Ghosh K. Dhar A. Roy S. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Chem. 2001; 276: 62-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An additional advantage with these compounds is the possibility of studying irreversible inhibition after photoincorporation by irradiation with UV light (29Seale J.W. Brazil B.T. Horowitz P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We show that bis-ANS and ANS can be used to obtain specific information about the interaction of LPL with substrates and apoCII. Our results suggest that bis-ANS binds to an exposed hydrophobic site at or close to the binding site(s) for apoCII and for individual substrate molecules. A similar site is not present in pancreatic lipase or bile salt-stimulated lipase. We propose that apoCII binds close to the substrate binding site on LPL and that the activator may play an important role for the alignment of individual substrate molecules into the active site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LPL was purified from bovine milk as described (30Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 345-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Bis-ANS and ANS were from Molecular Probes. Mutants of apoCII were expressed and purified as described in a previous study (16Shen Y. Lookene A. Nilsson S. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4334-4342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The apoCII fragment spanning residues 50–79 was synthesized for a previous study (31Lycksell P.-O.

Bile salt-stimulated lipase purified from human milk was a kind gift from Dr. Lars Bläckberg, Umeå University. Tributyrin, tripropionin, triacetin, tricaprylin p-nitrophenyl butyrate, bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and gum arabic were obtained from Sigma. 125I-LPL was prepared by the lactoperoxidase method and purified on heparin-Sepharose (34Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Inactive, monomeric LPL was prepared by treatment with 1 m guanidinium chloride as previously described (8Osborne Jr., J.C. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lee N.S. Olivecrona T. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5606-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 34Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The concentration of bis-ANS was determined by absorbance at 394 nm using A 394 = 16000 cm–1m–1 (35Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Conditions for Pretreatment of Lipases by Bis-ANS—Incubations with LPL were made under conditions when the enzyme was as stable as possible. Depending on the purpose for the experiment this was done either at 10 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, or at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 4 mm sodium deoxycholate. Stock solutions of bis-ANS (5 μm to10 mm) were made in methanol. Pancreatic lipase and bile-stimulated lipase were incubated with bis-ANS at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.5 or 0.15 m NaCl, respectively.Enzyme Assays—Most of the activity measurements with triacylglycerols as substrates were performed by continuous titration of fatty acids released using a pH-stat (Methrome, Herisau, Switzerland) at 25 °C. For these experiments stock solutions of the substrates were prepared by sonication of the triacylglycerols in gum arabic/water solution (MSE Soniprep). The enzymatic activity was recorded at pH 8.5 in 0.15 m NaCl containing 30 mm triacylglycerol and 0.2% gum arabic. In several experiments the reaction medium also contained bovine serum albumin as specified in the figure legends to Figs. 1 and 3.Fig. 3Effect of apoCII on reactivation of LPL previously inhibited by bis-ANS. A, effects of different substrates on reactivation. The substrates used were tributyrin (▾), tricaprylin (○), tripropionin (•), and triacetin (▿). The activity measurements were performed in solutions that contained 0.7 mg of BSA/ml, 15 IU heparin/ml, and 0.15 m NaCl. LPL (10 nm) was mixed with substrates (30 mm), and the reaction proceeded for 10 min before the addition of bis-ANS (8 μm final concentration). After 10 min, apoCII was added to the incubation mixtures from a stock solution in 6 m guanidine chloride (0.55 mm). B, reactivation by mutants/fragment of apoCII. Conditions were the same as in panel A but with the variants of apoCII mutants Y63F (▾) or Q70E (○) and the insertion mutant 63A (•), peptide spanning residues 50–79 from the C terminus of apoCII (▿). C, effects of apoCII at different concentrations of bis-ANS. Emulsified tricaprylin was used as substrate (30 mm). Reactivation was measured in the absence (•) as well as in the presence of 18 μm (○) or 30 μm (▾) bis-ANS. In all panels 100% corresponds to the LPL activity measured in the absence of apoCII and bis-ANS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The activity of LPL against p-nitrophenyl butyrate was measured at pH 7.4 at room temperature in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 15 IU heparin/ml and 0.15 m NaCl. The concentration of substrate ranged between 0.1 and 0.5 mm. The release of p-nitrophenol was continuously monitored at 400 nm.Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—For determination of the aggregation state of LPL·bis-ANS complexes, sedimentation was performed at 10 °C in linear gradients of sucrose (5–20%). The gradients (3.6 ml) were made in 20 mm Tris, 1.5 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4. Samples of LPL in the same buffer (0.5 μm, 200 μl total volume) were preincubated with bis-ANS in a 2- and 20-fold molar excess for 1 h and then applied on top of the gradients, which also contained the corresponding concentrations of bis-ANS. Centrifugation was for 18 h in a Beckman Coulter SW 60 rotor, and fractions of 0.24 ml were collected from the bottom of the tubes. In this case, activity measurements were made using [3H]triolein-labeled Intralipid (10%) as substrate (kindly prepared by The Upjohn Co., and the assay contained in addition to the long chain triacylglycerols 1 mm BSA and 5% rat serum as a source of apoCII to promote regain of activity of the inhibited enzyme (16Shen Y. Lookene A. Nilsson S. Olivecrona G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4334-4342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—This was carried out at 4 °C on a small column (2 ml of gel) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10% glycerol. After application of the sample and washing with buffer without NaCl, LPL was eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1.5 m. The salt gradient was determined by conductivity using known concentrations of NaCl made up in the same buffer as a standard.Measurements of Fluorescence and Circular Dichroism—Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Spex FluoroMax-2 fluorometer. The experiments were done either at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 4 mm sodium deoxycholate or at 10 °C in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 15 IU heparin/ml and 0.15 m NaCl. Stock solutions of bis-ANS were prepared in methanol. LPL concentrations varied between 30 and 100 nm. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out using a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter. The experiments were performed at 10 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 m NaCl.Binding Studies on BIAcore—The binding studies were performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument using sensorchips CM5. Most of the experimental details concerning immobilization of heparin and kinetic analyses of data are described in previous studies (36Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Ostergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 37Lookene A. Savonen R. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5267-5275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The binding experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. To estimate how many bis-ANS molecules that bound per LPL, we used the established relationship that for proteins a surface density of 1 ng/mm2 increases the response by about 1000 units. We assumed that this relationship was valid also for bis-ANS (38Davis T.M. Wilson W.D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).Photoincorporation of Bis-ANS—This was carried out according to Seale et al. (29Seale J.W. Brazil B.T. Horowitz P.M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of LPL in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, or in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 4 mm deoxycholate in the presence of various concentrations of bis-ANS were irradiated at 4 °C by UV light (250 nm). For comparison, samples of LPL without bis-ANS, were given the same treatment. After irradiation, unbound bis-ANS was removed by extensive dialysis against 0.05% SDS or against the deoxycholate-containing buffer, depending on the purpose for the experiment. For determination of the amount of bis-ANS bound by spectrophotometry, the LPL·/bis-ANS complexes were precipitated in 50% ice-cold acetone. Control experiments showed that free bis-ANS was not precipitated by this treatment.Fragmentation of LPL by Proteinases or CNBr—Limited proteolysis of complexes of LPL (0.3 mg/ml) and bis-ANS with trypsin or chymotrypsin was done at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-Cl, 4 mm deoxycholate, pH 8.5. After 15 min with the proteinases (1.5 μg/ml), SDS was added, and the samples were heated to 95 °C before analyses by SDS-PAGE (39Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

Treatment with CNBr was carried out as previously described (41Nykjær A. Nielsen M. Lookene A. Meyer N. Roigaard H. Etzerodt M. Beisiegel U. Olivecrona G. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31747-31755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Determination of Kinetic Parameters—The kinetic parameters Ki and Ar , characterizing the inhibitory efficiency (explained below under “Results”), were obtained from the equation, A=Ar+B×KiKi+C(Eq. 1) where A is the measured activity, Ar is a calculated constant describing the activity of the LPL·bis complex, C is the concentration of bis-ANS, Ki is the inhibition constant, and B is a proportional constant.Fluorescence titration curves were analyzed by the equation, F=a×CKd+C+b×C(Eq. 2) where F is fluorescence intensity, a and b are proportional constants, and C is the concentration of bis-ANS. The program SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for the determination of the kinetic parameters.RESULTSEffects of Bis-ANS on the Activity of LPL against Different Lipid Substrates—Preliminary experiments showed that bis-ANS inhibited LPL both with water-soluble and with emulsified substrates. The efficiency of the inhibition was dependent on the substrate and the assay system used. There was no detectable inhibition of LPL when the assays were run in the presence of high concentrations of BSA and apoCII. In contrast, in the presence of low concentrations of BSA (<2 mg/ml) and in the absence of apoCII, inhibition was observed already at micromolar concentration of bis-ANS. These concentrations were 500–2000 times lower than the substrate concentrations used in the assay systems. The inhibition of LPL was very rapid, and kinetics were not possible to analyze by the methods used here. In the following sections we focus mainly on the LPL-bis-ANS interaction and present data obtained in systems with low concentrations of BSA (1 mg/ml) and no apoCII.The most pronounced effects of bis-ANS were observed when emulsified short chain triacylglycerols (tributyrin or tripropionin) were used as substrates (Fig. 1). The residual activity was close to 0 already with 10–15 μm bis-ANS. Somewhat higher concentrations of bis-ANS were needed for inhibition of activity against the medium chain triacylglycerol tricaprylin, the long chain triacylglycerol triolein, or the water-soluble short chain triacylglycerol triacetin. With p-nitrophenyl butyrate the activity dropped to 50% already in the presence of 0.08 μm bis-ANS but remained unchanged at higher bis-ANS concentrations (data not shown).The inhibition curves could be fitted to simple decay hyperbolas, indicating that there was no cooperativity in the inhibition mechanism. Two parameters, Ki and Ar , were calculated for characterization of the inhibition efficiency. The Ki values represent the apparent affinity of bis-ANS for LPL, and the Ar values correspond to the residual activity of the bis-ANS/LPL complex. A high Ki value represents a weak binding of bis-ANS to LPL. The Ki values varied more than 10-fold with different substrates. It is, therefore, likely that the Ki depends not only on the affinity of LPL for bis-ANS, which is probably the same in all systems, but also on the interaction of LPL with the substrate. With emulsified substrates with acyl chains containing 3, 4, 8, and 18 carbons the Ki values increased in parallel with increasing length of the acyl chains, suggesting that bis-ANS and the substrates competed for a hydrophobic area on the enzyme. With emulsions of triacylglycerols with long acyl chains, the action of LPL occurs at the lipid/water interface in a two-dimensional heterogeneous environment where only a small fraction of the total amount of substrate and inhibitor are accessible to the enzyme. Emulsified systems are therefore not suitable for detailed examination the inhibition mechanism. By using the soluble triacetin we were able to demonstrate partial competition between bis-ANS and individual substrate molecules (Fig. 1B). At higher triacetin concentrations, more bis-ANS was needed for the inhibition, indicating that bis-ANS impaired the substrate-LPL interaction.The other parameter was residual activity (Ar). This characterizes the remaining activity of the bis-ANS·LPL complex. As seen in Table I, the calculated Ar values were clearly greater than zero with smaller substrates like p-nitrophenyl butyrate and triacetin, whereas for more hydrophobic substrates with longer acyl chains, the Ar values were close to zero. These results suggested that bis-ANS may sterically hinder the binding of individual substrate molecules to the active site of LPL.Table IParameters characterizing the inhibition of LPL by bis-ANS in different substrate systemsSubstrateKiAr (%)μmTriacetin3.10 ± 0.197.02 ± 1.30Tripropionin0.28 ± 0.030.12 ± 1.30Tributyrin0.38 ± 0.040Tricaprylin1.65 ± 0.340Triolein4.67 ± 0.201.50 ± 1.43pNPB0.04 ± 0.0128 ± 5 Open table in a new tab Other hydrophobic probes with chemical structures similar to bis-ANS, but smaller, like ANS and T3, also inhibited LPL. Their Ki values with tributyrin as substrate were, however, much higher than those for bis-ANS (Table II, compare with Table I), indicating a 10–50-fold lower affinity of LPL for ANS and T3 than for bis-ANS. Complexes of LPL with ANS or T3 retained more activity than complexes with bis-ANS (Table II, Ar values, compare with Table I).Table IIParameters characterizing the inhibition of LPL by ANS and T3 with tributyrin as substrateInhibitorKiArμm%ANS23.1 ± 3.414.8 ± 3.1T34.0 ± 0.912.8 ± 6.2 Open table in a new tab Bis-ANS Had No Effect on the Interaction of LPL with Heparin or Lipid Particles or on the Dimeric Structure of LPL—One possible reason for the inhibition caused by bis-ANS was impaired binding of LPL to the emulsion particles. To test this, we mixed 125I-labeled LPL with emulsified tributyrin and added increasing amounts of bis-ANS. The ratio of free/bound LPL was determined after sedimentation of the emulsion by centrifugation. We found that relatively low concentrations of bis-ANS, which were sufficient for complete inhibition of LPL activity, did not affect the binding of LPL to the lipid droplets (Table III). However, at very high concentrations of bis-ANS (>75 μm), binding of LPL to the emulsion particles was decreased. Because we were focused mainly on the effects of the high affinity binding of bis-ANS to LPL, we did not further investigate the effects at high concentrations of the inhibitor.Table IIIEffects of bis-ANS on binding of LPL to emulsion droplets of tributyrinConcentration of bis-ANSDistribution of LPLμmfree/bound02.0 ± 0.30.42.2 ± 0.23.03.0 ± 0.28.02.4 ± 0.122.02.8 ± 0.242.03.2 ± 0.175.07.9 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Another possible explanation for the inhibition was that bis-ANS caused dissociation of active LPL dimers to inactive monomers. Ultracentrifugation in sucrose density gradients in the presence of bis-ANS at a molar excess of 2:1 or 20:1 over LPL demonstrated that the remaining LPL activity (measured against triolein) sedimented corresponding to dimeric enzyme (Fig. 2A). LPL monomers have lower affinity than LPL dimers for heparin, and separation can therefore also be achieved by chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (42Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2116036578,"A33 antigen is a membrane-bound protein that is expressed only in intestinal epithelium and in most human colon cancers. Thus, A33 antigen has been explored as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colon cancers. However, little is known about the mechanism responsible for the tissue-specific pattern of its expression. In this report, we demonstrate that gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor (GKLF) binds to the promoter region of A33 antigen gene in colonic carcinoma cells and that mutations in the GKLF binding sequence in this region lead to diminished expression of A33 antigen. In addition, the expression of GKLF is linked to the expression of A33 antigen and blocking the expression of GKLF leads to the abolishment of A33 antigen expression. These results suggest that GKLF is a critical regulator in inducing the expression of A33 antigen in intestinal epithelium. While it has been suggested that GKLF is a regulator in inducing cell growth arrest and differentiation of the intestine, our observation that A33 antigen gene is a downstream target for GKLF suggests a more complex and diverse role for GKLF in the gut."

The RDH-S gene localizes to chromosome 10D3 with the SDR subfamily that catalyzes metabolism of retinoids and 3α-hydroxysteroids. RDH-S has no activity with prototypical retinoid/steroid substrates, despite 92% amino acid similarity to mouse RDH1. This afforded the opportunity to analyze for functions of non-catalytic SDR residues. We produced RDH-SΔ3 by mutating RDH-S to remove an “additional” Asn residue relative to RDH1 in its center, to convert three residues into RDH1 residues (L121P, S122N, and Q123E), and to substitute RDH1 sequence G208FKTCVTSSD for RDH-S sequence F208-FLTGMASSA. RDH-SΔ3 catalyzed all-trans-retinol and 5α-androstane-3α,17α-diol (3α-adiol) metabolism 60–70% as efficiently (Vm /Km) as RDH1. Conversely, substituting RDH-S sequence F208FLTGMASSA into RDH1 produced a chimera (viz. C3) that was inactive with all-trans-retinol, but was 4-fold more efficient with 3α-adiol. A single RDH1 mutation in the C3 region (K210L) reduced efficiency for all-trans-retinol by >1250-fold. In contrast, the C3 area mutation C212G enhanced efficiency with all-trans-retinol by ∼2.4-fold. This represents a >6000-fold difference in catalytic efficiency for two enzymes that differ by a single non-catalytic amino acid residue. Another chimera (viz. C5) retained efficiency with all-trans-retinol, but was not saturated and was weakly active with 3α-adiol, stemming from three residue differences (K224Q, K229Q, and A230T). The residues studied contribute to the substrate-binding pocket: molecular modeling indicated that they would affect orientation of substrates with the catalytic residues.

SDR family members do not always share substantial amino acid identities and have relatively few strictly conserved residues. Animal SDR catalyze intermediary metabolism and activation/inactivation of nuclear receptor ligands such as prostaglandins, retinoids, and steroid hormones. SDR tend to have multifunctional catalytic abilities: they can catalyze reactions with dissimilar substrates and/or can recognize functional groups in different loci of the same substrates. An apparent subgroup of the SDR superfamily consisting of phylogenetically related enzymes catalyzes dehydrogenation of all-trans-retinol, cis-retinols, and androgens or reduction of retinals. Functions of this subgroup could include serving in the visual cycle, generating the endocrine factors all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid, reducing retinal produced by carotenoid metabolism, and/or reactivating 5α-androstane-3α,17α-diol (3α-adiol) into dihydrotestosterone (4Napoli J.L.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5275-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Other mouse SDR such as CRAD1 and CRAD3 catalyze 9-cis-retinol dehydrogenation much more efficiently than all-trans-retinol dehydrogenation and have weak, if any, activity with all-trans-retinol (8Chai X.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). CRAD2 has very low efficiency for all-trans-retinol and even lower efficiency for 9-cis-retinol (10Su J. Chai X. Kahn B.

RDH4 catalyzes all-trans-retinol dehydrogenation at least 2 orders of magnitude less efficiently than RDH1 (11Gamble M.V. Shang E. Zott R.P. Mertz J.R. Wolgemuth D.J. Blaner W.S. J.

Therefore, although an array of SDR catalyze retinoid metabolism, RDH1 represents the only SDR thus far in the mouse with high catalytic efficiency for all-trans-retinol dehydrogenation and widespread tissue expression, with expression initiating early during embryogenesis.Here we report cDNA cloning of a novel mouse SDR gene and determination of its mRNA expression pattern and its chromosomal localization. This SDR, termed retinol dehydrogenase-similar (RDH-S), shares 92–95% amino acid similarity with mouse RDH1, CRAD1, and CRAD3, but does not have enzyme activity with their prototypical substrates. This afforded the opportunity to investigate the residues that influence substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency for retinoids and androgens. We prepared RDH1/RDH-S chimeras and mutants of RDH-S and RDH1 and determined their catalytic activities with retinoids and steroids. We show that minor alterations activate RDH-S, that one-residue changes in RDH1 have a large impact on efficiency for retinol, and that relatively limited changes alter the specificity and/or catalytic efficiency for either retinol or 3α-adiol. These data provide new insight into the amino acid residues that contribute to the substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of SDR and present the possibility that RDH-S may have a regulatory rather than an enzymatic function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Cloning of Mouse RDH-S (mRDH-S)—Mouse E17 poly(A+) RNA (Sigma) was subjected to reverse transcription at 42 °C for 60 min using random hexamers. PCR was done with primers 5′-TTYATHACNGGNTGYGAYTCNGGNTTYGGN (forward) and 5′-RTCNGARAANGCYTCNANNCCRWAYTTNGA (reverse) for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The 468-bp products were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega), sequenced, and analyzed using NTI Vector Suite 5.5 (InforMax). Mouse E17 cDNA (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA, Clontech) was used as template for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to extend the 5′- and 3′-ends of one product. 5′-RACE was done with antisense primer R1 (5′-GACGTTGACTACACGGCCCCTT) with PCR conditions of one cycle at 94 °C for 1.5 min, five cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 3 min, five cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 70 °C for 3 min, and 25 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 68 °C for 3 min, followed by 68 °C for 5 min. Antisense primer R2 (5′-AGTTCTGTTTGTTCATCCACTGAC) was used for nested PCR with the first RACE products as templates. PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 1.5 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 40 s and 61 °C for 1 min, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. Antisense primers R3 (5′-TGAAGACATACTTGTCTTGGAGG) and R4 (5′-TGTCCACAGTCCCACCAGTGGTA; nested for primer R3) were used to extend the 5′-region further. 3′-RACE was done with sense primers F1 (5′-TCTCCGTCCCCTTGGGTCTCAGTC) and F2 (5′-CATCATGGGTCGAGTGTCACTTCA; nested for primer F1) using the PCR conditions described above for primers R1 and R2, respectively. Further extension was achieved with sense primers F3 (AGTGTCACTTCATGGTAA) and F4 (GGGGTTCTTCATTCACACAT) with PCR conditions of 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 52 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. To extend the 3′-untranslated region even further, sense primers F4 and F5 (GTGTCCCTTCTCTGAAACCAGA; nested with primer F4) were used. Adapter-specific primer AP1 (CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) was used with primers R1, R3, F1, and F3; adapter-specific primer AP2 (ACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAGCGGC) was used with primers R2, R4, F2, F4, and F5. RACE products were gel-purified, cloned into pGEM-T, and sequenced. We amplified a 1.1-kb cDNA containing the coding region with sense primer F6 (5′-AACCATGTGGCTCTACCTAGTAC) and antisense primer R5 (5′-AATGAGATGAAATGTGTGAATGA) using mouse e17 cDNA. This PCR product was used as template with sense primer F7 (; underlining indicates an EcoRI site, and double underlining indicates a Kozak sequence) and antisense primer R6 (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGAGGGCTTTCTCA; underlining indicates an XhoI site). The PCR product was gel-purified, digested with EcoRI/XhoI, and cloned into pcDNA3 to construct pcDNA3/RDH-S.Radiation Hybrid Mapping—A mouse radiation hybrid panel was purchased from Research Genetics. A forward primer (CCCTGGGTAGGAGGTTCAGTCCCT) and a reverse primer (ACAGGTAAATTCTGTTCATGGGCTT) were selected from the 3′-untranslated sequence of the mRDH-S cDNA for amplification. PCR was done for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The radiation hybrid PCR experiment was repeated, and the sequence of the amplified 350-bp fragment was confirmed by sequencing. The PCR results were sent for analysis to the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research. 2Available at www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/mouse_rh/rhmapauto/rhmapper.cgi.Northern Blotting—A probe from the 3′-untranslated region of mRDH-S was amplified from the cDNA with the primers used for radiation hybrid mapping. The PCR product was cloned into vector pGEM-T, sequenced, and labeled with [32P]dCTP using the RadPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). The probe was hybridized overnight at 68 °C with a mouse multiple-tissue blot (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse β-actin cDNA was used as a control. Blots were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at –70 °C for 1 day.Mouse RDH1 (mRDH1) Mutants—mRDH-S and mRDH1 cDNAs were amplified using forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCACCATGTGGCTCTACCT-3′, with an engineered BamHI restriction site and a Kozak sequence, and reverse primer 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGAGGGCTTTCTCAGGCT-3′, containing an EcoRI site. PCR products were digested with BamHI and EcoRI and cloned into pcDNA3. We used restriction sites to create chimeras/mutants A7P, C1, C2, C2+N, C4, and C6. Chimeras C3 and C5 were made by PCR mutagenesis. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutagenesis was done using the BamHI/XbaI sites of pcDNA3/mRDH1. Splicing by overlap extension was used in PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase of an mRDH1 region with primers containing the desired mutation (17Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The primers were 18 or 21 nucleotides long with the mutation located centrally: K210L, 5′-CACACAAGTTAGGAAGCCGCC-3′ (forward) and 5-GGCGGCTTCCTAACTTGTGTG-3′ (reverse); C212G, 5′-ACTTGTCACGCCAGTCTTGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCAAGACTGGCGTGACAAGT-3′ (reverse); V213M, 5′-ACTACTTGTCATACAAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTTGTATGACAAGTAGT-3′ (reverse); T214A, 5′-ACTACTAGCCACACAAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACTTGTGTGACAAGTAGT-3′ (reverse); and D217A, 5′-TGATAGCCTAGCACTACTTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAAGTAGTGCTAGGCTATCA-3′ (reverse). After the first round of PCR, amplified fragments were gel-purified, and each was used as template for overlapping PCR extension using forward primer 5′-GCTCTAGATCAGAGGGCTTTCTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGGATCCCCACCATGTGGCTC-3′. BamHI/XbaI digestions were done on the PCR fragments from the second round. The fragments were gel-purified and ligated into pcDNA3. PCR was done with 30 cycles of 92 °C for 45 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression of RDH—CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with pcDNA3 constructs (8 μg/100-mm plate) with LipofectAMINE, harvested 24 h later, and lysed as described (6Zhang M. Chen W. Smith M.S. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44083-44090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The supernatant obtained from centrifuging the lysates at 800 × g for 10 min was used for enzyme and Western blot analyses. Supernatants from CHO-K1 cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pFLAGCMV5a (Sigma) served as controls. Protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding method (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar).Enzyme Assays—Protein amounts and reaction times were used in the linear range to obtain initial velocity values. Kinetic analyses were done with two to three replicates per point at 37 °C in 0.25 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm NAD+ (pH 8.0) with 2–4 μg of protein for 8–15 min for all-trans- and 9-cis-retinol. Analyses of 3H-labeled steroids (20,000 dpm/reaction) were done with 1–3 μg of protein for 1.5–2 min. Each curve was obtained at least twice. Retinoids were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. 3H-Labeled steroids (40–101 Ci/mmol) were separated by thin-layer chromatography, detected by autoradiography, and quantified using liquid scintillation counting as described (6Zhang M.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Kinetic data were fit by nonlinear regression analysis with Prism Version 3.0 (GraphPAD Software, Inc).FLAG-tagged Fusion Proteins—To produce FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK)-tagged RDH, expression vectors were used as templates with forward primer 5′-CGGAATTCCACCATGTGGCTCTACCTGGTT (containing a Kozak sequence) and reverse primer 5′-GGGGTACCGAGGGCTTTCTCAGG, which moved the stop codon to place the FLAG sequence in-frame at the C terminus. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and KpnI and cloned into pFLAGCMV5a.Western Blotting—Ten μg of cell lysate protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-mRDH1 antibody (1:5000 (v/v); raised against RDH1 peptide D217RLSSNTKMIWDKASSEVK) in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. For FLAG-tagged proteins, mouse anti-FLAG tag monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) was used at a dilution of 1:5000 (v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween. Blots were incubated with either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Bands were visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.Molecular Modeling—mRDH1 was modeled using Swiss-Model Version 36.0002. Details of the modeling procedure have been described, including global alignment, model relaxation for possible steric overlaps of the side chains, and energy minimization (19Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9464) Google Scholar, 20Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 21Peitsch M.C. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 658-660Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The BLASTP2 program found all similarities using pairwise alignment of mRDH1 with sequences of three-dimensional structures from the ExNRL-3D Database. The SIM program selected all templates with amino acid sequence identities above 25% and projected model size larger than 20 residues. This step also detected domains that could be modeled based on unrelated templates. This generated ProModII (Version 3.5) input files. Global alignment was done using the loaded templates. ProModII then generated all models using the ExPDB Database. Energy minimization of all models was done with the Gromos96 program.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONcDNA Cloning of RDH-S—We sequenced 14 clones encoding SDR after reverse transcription-PCR of mouse E17 embryo mRNA using primers from conserved regions (F33ITGCDSGFG and S179K(Y/F)G(I/V/L/F/M)EAFSD) of retinoid/steroid-metabolizing SDR. Eight encoded CRAD2 (10Su J. Chai X. Kahn B. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17910-17916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); two encoded 17β-HSD9 (7Su J. Lin M. Napoli J.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5275-5284Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); three encoded an orphan SDR (22Chen W. Song M.-S. Napoli J.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); and one encoded a novel SDR, similar to RDH1, which we named RDH-S. 5′- and 3′-RACE generated the full-length coding sequence of mRDH-S. The 3′-untranslated region was extended further with two rounds of 3′-RACE to generate a cDNA of 1890 bp (Fig. 1). The open reading frame encodes a deduced protein of 318 amino acid residues with high homology to other SDR that catalyze retinoid/steroid metabolism (Table I). mRDH-S differs in only 33 residues from RDH1, many of them conservative substitutions (Fig. 2). Notably, RDH-S has the six peptide motifs characteristic of retinoid/steroid-metabolizing SDR (1Bailey T.L. Baker M.E. Elkan C.P. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 62: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Nineteen of the 23 amino acid residues conserved in ∼70% of SDR occur within these six motifs. Conserved residues include the cofactor-binding sequences T35GX 3GXG and N111NAG in the first and second motifs, the catalytic sequence S164 X 11YX 3K in the fourth and fifth motifs, part of the substrate-binding domain in the sixth motif, and the oligomerization domain in the third motif. An additional amino acid, Asn, occurs in RDH-S between residues 173 and 174 (RDH1 numbering), which potentially could change the secondary/tertiary structure relationship between catalytic residues Ser164, Tyr176, and Lys180.Table INuclcotide and amino acid sequences of RDH-S and related SDRSpeciesSDR (gene)Nucleotide identityAmino acid homologyGenBank™/EBI accession no.IdentitySimilarity%%MouseRDH-S100100100AY046408MouseCRAD1 (Rdh6)949193AF030513MouseCRAD3 (Rdh9)939095AF372838MouseRDH1 (Rdh1)928992AY028928RatRoDH2908590U33500MouseCRAD2 (Rdh7)868088AF056194RatRoDH3858086U33501RatRoDH1857986U18762HumanRDH-E/RDH4787081NM003708/AF086735HumanHSE/RDH716593U89281/AF223225Mouse17β-HSD9 (Rdh8)706675AF103797Rat17β-HSD6706373U89280MouseSDR-O635165AY04434Mouse9,11-cis-RDH (Rdh4)605065AF013288Human9,11-cis-RDH (Rdh5)604863U43559Human3α-HSD/RDH-TBE554764AF343729/AY017349MouseretSDR1452232AF061743HumanretSDR1442132AF061741Humanpr-RDH441933AF229845MouseRRD421628AB045132 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2mRDH-S and mRDH1 amino acid sequences.

The RDH-S gene maps close to seven other members of the subfamily (Fig. 4).Fig. 4mRDH-S chromosomal locus. mRDH-S localizes to mouse chromosome 10D3 near the genes that encode the other members of the SDR subfamily that recognize retinoids and steroids as substrates.

These include all-trans-retinol, 9-cis-retinol, 3α-adiol, and androsterone (data not shown). The lack of RDH-S activity was surprising because none of the residue differences occurred in obviously crucial sections (see above), and many were conservative substitutions. These limited differences between RDH1 and RDH-S afforded the opportunity to distinguish the residues in SDR that contribute to activity with retinoids and steroids.Distinct Requirements for Steroid Versus Retinoid Activity— The non-conservative differences provide obvious starting points for evaluating the effects of substituting RDH-S residues into RDH1. The RDH1 mutant A7P behaved enzymatically similar to RDH1; therefore, no further analysis was done with this mutant. Substituting the section of RDH-S from residues 117 to 147 into RDH1 produced chimera C1, with nine total and eight non-conservative residue differences from RDH1 (Figs. 2 and 5). C1 had no detectable activity with all-trans-retinol or 3α-adiol (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 4). C1 mutant L121P/S122N/Q123E, i.e. C1/PNE, was made because sequence L121SQ in C1 differs substantially from P121NE conserved in mRDH1, rat RoDH1–3, and the human ortholog RDH-E. C1/PNE had partial activity with all-trans-retinol and 3α-adiol (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 5). Mutating any two of the three C1 residues produced chimeras/mutants without activity (C1/PN, C1/PE, and C1/NE) (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 6–8). Chimera C2 differs from RDH1 in four residues, with one non-conservative change. C2 had partial activity with both substrates (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 9). Chimera C2 with Asn inserted between residues 173 and 174 of RDH1, i.e. C2+N, was inactive with both substrates (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 10). Chimera C3 differs in six residues from mRDH1, with three non-conservative changes. C3 was not active with all-trans-retinol, but catalyzed 3α-adiol metabolism at a higher rate than RDH1 (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 11). Chimera C4, which includes the RDH-S residues of C3 as well as six additional differences, four of which are non-conservative, was inactive with both all-trans-retinol and 3α-adiol (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 12). Consequently, only all-trans-retinol activity requires the specific C3 area residues of RDH1, but 3α-adiol activity requires the residues in the C-terminal part of C4, i.e. Lys224, Lys229, and Ala230. Chimera C5, which partially overlaps with C4, had activity with both all-trans-retinol and 3α-adiol, but not as high as that of RDH1 (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 13), indicating compensation for the deleterious effects of the residues in the C terminus of C4. Chimera C6, which has the C-terminal 76 residues of RDH-S substituted into RDH1, catalyzed a higher rate of metabolism with all-trans-retinol and a lower rate with 3α-adiol (Fig. 6, A and B, bars 14). This is intriguing because, with one exception (N249S), the nine residue differences are conservative in the C6 sections of RDH1 and RDH-S.Fig. 5Schematic of RDH1 and RDH-S chimeras. The open bars indicate amino acid residues from RDH1; the filled bars indicate residues from RDH-S. The numbers above the bars (other than 1 and 317) indicate the beginning of the inserted sequence followed by the return to the RDH1 or RDH-S template sequence, e.g. in C1, 117 indicates the first residue of the RDH-S section inserted into RDH1, and 148 indicates the return to RDH1 sequence. Therefore, the insertion in this case represents RDH-S residues 117–147. In C1/PNE, 121 indicates the beginning of RDH1 residues 121–123 inserted into the section of RDH-S represented in C1, and 124 indicates the return to RDH-S residues. In C1/PE, 122 indicates Ser122 of RDH-S inserted between Pro121 and Glu123 of RDH1.View Large Image"
