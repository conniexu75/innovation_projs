https://openalex.org/W2011916250,"Evidence for a major meteorite impact on the earth 65 million years ago is shown by the presence of meteoritic debris in the ""fish clay"" from Denmark representing the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Noble metals (iridium, osmium, gold, platinum, rhenium, ruthenium, palladium, nickel, and cobalt), which are sensitive indicators of meteorites and are normally depleted on the terrestrial surface by factors of 10(4) to 10(2) relative to cosmic abundances, are enriched in this boundary clay by factors of 5 to 100 over the expected abundances. With the exception of rhenium, all the enriched noble metals in the clay are present in cosmic proportions, indicating that the impacting celestial body had not undergone gross chemical differentiation. The major extinction of life on the earth at the end of the Cretaceous Period may be related to the meteorite impact."

The former type is exemplified chiefly by the eye-elevation hypothesis in the work of Boring and his colleagues; the latter, by the apparent-distance hypothesis based on the superior cues to distance provided by the terrain. Boring had rejected the apparent-distance hypothesis on the grounds that the horizon moon is reported as nearer, not farther away, by most observers. He then performed experiments which supported the eye-elevation hypothesis."

The 2 x 10(5)-year-long ""punctuation"" may represent parapatric speciation. Commonness of depth-related clines before, during and after this event suggests that short-term adjustment to local conditions was important in long-term evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2042663234,"In a series of experiments where iron was added to natural waters and photosynthesis was measured by the radiocarbon method, we found that inorganic precipitation of carbon-14, presumably by mechanisms of occlusive coprecipitation, resulted from additions of 100 or more micrograms of iron per liter. Low levels of iron and prefiltered controls are suggested as correction measures."

This value is similar to the sulfur dioxide emissions of other Central American volcanoes but less than those measured at Mount Etna, an exceptionally strong volcanic source of sulfur dioxide."

https://openalex.org/W2018874128,"High-sensitivity x-ray measurements with the recently launched Einstein Observatory are having a major impact on wide areas of astronomical research. The x-ray luminosity of young O, B, and A stars and late K and M stars is found to be several orders of magnitude greater than predicted by current theories of coronal heating. Detailed x-ray images and spectra of supernova remnants are providing new information on the temperature, composition, and distribution of material ejected in supernova explosions as well as of the material comprising the interstellar medium. Observations of galaxies are yielding insights on the formation and evolution of stellar systems and galaxies over a wide range of variables. X-ray time variations are being used to probe the underlying energy source in quasars and active galactic nuclei. The distribution of mass in clusters of galaxies is being traced through detailed x-ray images, and the data are being used to classify clusters and trace their formation and evolution. Substantial progress is being made in several areas of cosmological research, particularly in the study of the diffuse x-ray background."

https://openalex.org/W1982702539,"In concluding this discussion it may be appropriate to return to the theme introduced earlier and raise the question once again of the deeper, and possibly philosophical, meaning of the term ""elementary"" particle. As we have seen, the proton and neutron, which were once thought to be elementary particles, are now seen to be highly complex bodies. It is almost certain that physicists will subsequently investigate the constituent parts of the proton and neutron-the mesons of one sort or another. What will happen from that point on? One can only guess at future problems and future progress, but my personal conviction is that the search for ever-smaller and ever-more-fundamental particles will go on as long as man retains the curiosity he has always demonstrated (29)."

https://openalex.org/W1972158729,"France's commitment to the Super-Phenix, a fast breeder reactor under construction on the bank of the Rhone River, is a model of vitality for nuclear development. A comprehensive program to cover each stage of the fuel cycle was prompted by a need for energy independence. A small amount of domestic uranium, long-standing competence in nuclear science and technology, and a political consensus have enabled the program to have continuity in spite of some controversy and public opposition. France's nuclear facilities include, besides the Super-Phenix, a variety of nuclear power reactors, fuel reprocessing plants, and enrichment facilities. (DCK)"

https://openalex.org/W2090116565,"If the United States is to sustain a fairly high level of economic growth, seven functional needs must be met: transportation, communication, power, innovation, human resources, financialbegal institutions, and capital goods. Attention to these elements amounted for the successful development of the infrastructure and the capital goods sector during America's first industrialization, roughly from the 1820s to the 1920s, providing the foundation for a strong economy able to mass-produce consumer goods and services. In the decades following World War II, however, roughly from 1950 to the late 1970s, insufficient resources were dedicated to maintaining and adapting these seven elements, and in varying degrees all but one deteriorated. The result was economic underdevelopment. For the United States to regain i t s economic vitality, steps must now be taken to serve these basic needs of economic development more effectively."

The groups will take air samples and estimate impact of acid rain on the environment, determine the precise origin of acid rain, and develop a strategy for abatement. Some constraints on the negotiations are costs (potentially $400-500 million for Canada and 5 to 8 times that for the US between now and 2000), the relative independence of Canada's provinces, and the US utility lobby."
