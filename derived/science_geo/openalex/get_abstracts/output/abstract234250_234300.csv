https://openalex.org/W2088890452,"DURING an investigation into the relationship between acetylcholine synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism in the central nervous system, it became important for us to study the inhibitory action of glucose and fructose on the rate of acetyl-choline formation by extracts of acetone-dried brain powder. Acetylcholine synthesis in such extracts and in homogenates proceeds rapidly under anaerobic conditions provided adenosinetriphosphate is present 1 2. Feldberg and Mann1 also reported an inhibitory action of hexoses on this process. They made the suggestion that the sugars exercised their effects by being phos-phorylated at the expense of adenosinetriphosphate, the quantity of the latter thus being diminished and the rate of acetylcholine synthesis being correspondingly decreased."

https://openalex.org/W1987456191,"A SEARCH has been made for new radioactive isotopes produced by (γ,n) and (γ,p) reactions in various elements irradiated with 23-MeV. X-rays from a synchrotron. Whenever possible, a chemical identification of the element responsible for the radioactivity was made. A thin-window (1.7 mgm. cm.−2) Geiger counter was used for measuring the decay of the activities. The activities were usually too small and short-lived to permit any accurate measurement of the β-particle or positron energies."

They became abundant in all tents and vehicles over an area of not less than 75 square miles. They then became scarcer and disappeared after three or four days, when no further specimen could be found."

https://openalex.org/W2075230306,"THE feeding mechanism and mode of feeding of tadpoles of Xenopus lævis have been described, notably by Bles1 and by Weisz2. These workers agree in postulating a ciliary mechanism; but their accounts of the nature and functioning of this mechanism differ widely. Bles recognized a ciliated pharyngeal groove lying along the outer margin of the branchial chamber on each side as the main food-collecting channel. Weisz, on the other hand, holds that food particles never reach the branchial chambers, and makes no mention of the ciliated paths which lie at their outer margins and converge on the œsophagus. He states that the middle region of the pharyngeal floor (called by him the “pharyngobranchial tract” and said to be ciliated) is responsible for creating ciliary currents by which food particles pass backwards into the alimentary canal."

https://openalex.org/W2012144520,"THE in vitro effects of hormones on animal hexokinase described by Colowick, Cori and Slein1 suggested the possibility of using the hexokinase reaction as a test system for the investigation of hormonal levels in human blood. Smith2 recently reported an unsuccessful attempt to isolate hexokinase inhibitors from fractions of diabetic plasma. In our own experiments an inhibition of hexokinase by unfractionated diabetic plasma, reversible by insulin in vivo, though not regularly in vitro, could be observed in seven out of fourteen cases investigated so far."

https://openalex.org/W2094776173,"FOR the synthesis of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols or phenols, it is customary to heat the reactants for several hours in the presence of a strong mineral acid catalyst, or else to proceed via the acid chloride or the acid anhydride. We now report a method of esterifleation which obviates the necessity of a two-stage process and, at the same time, enables a rapid direct reaction to occur between the acid and the hydroxy-compound under mild conditions. The new method, which entails the use of the anhydride of trifluoracetic acid, gives the purified esters in yields of 60–90 per cent."

https://openalex.org/W2000500126,"THE substrate specificity of the yeast carbohydrases has been studied by many authors1–3. It has been concluded4,5 that standard industrial yeasts—brewers', distillers' and bakers' yeasts—contain carbohydrases the substrate specificity of which is determined qualitatively only by the nature of the glucosidic terminal unit of the sugar substrate. On this basis, distinction has been made between the following: (1) a beta-fructofuranosidase which catalyses the removal by hydrolysis of the fructofuranosidic terminal from sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, gentianose and beta-methylfructofuranoside, (2) an alpha-glucosidase which catalyses the removal by hydrolysis of the alpha-glucosidic terminal from maltose, sucrose, turanose, melezitose and suitable synthetic alpha-alkyl glucosides and alpha-aryl glucosides, and (3) an alpha-galactosidase, which catalyses the hydrolyses of the alpha-galactosidic terminal from melibiose, raffinose and alpha-phenyl galactoside."
https://openalex.org/W2035350396,"THE favourable nature of amphibian material has permitted the unequivocal demonstration, by both histological1,2 and experimental3,4 techniques, of the neural crest origin of most of the splanchnocranium and of the anterior portion of the trabeculæ cranii in these animals. In no other vertebrates is the position so clear; but in selachians5 and birds6 a similar origin has been claimed for the visceral bars as a result of studies of normal developmental stages. In cyclostomes the fate of the neural crest and the origin of the head skeleton is of particular interest in view of the doubt cast by Balfour on the homology of the visceral skeleton of lampreys with that of gnathostomes, and the suggestion of Sewertzoff and of de Beer7 that the ‘trabeculæ cranii’ of these animals are not visceral elements but are more properly regarded as anterior parachordals."

https://openalex.org/W2080589288,"IN the course of some investigations on the minute cuticular hairs of certain insects1, a replica technique was devised which, by virtue of its simplicity, may be of general interest. The medium of which these replicas were formed was a strong solution of glycerine in gelatin, obtained by steeping powdered gelatin in glycerine for some hours at 50–60° C. until homogeneous. The strength found to be most effective was about 50 per cent w/w; but the exact amounts to be employed are probably best determined by trial, since the nature of the sample of gelatin used probably has an effect. A very small quantity of water added to the mixture was found to hasten and improve the homogenizing process; but too much water should be avoided as it appears to reduce the quality of the replicas by rendering them too soft and plastic. The solution should normally be of such strength as to gelate at about 40–50° C., and set instantaneously below 30° C.; when in use it is conveniently kept liquid by means of a hot-water bath."

It is now apparently causing serious concern in Great Britain. Repeated attempts at transmission by the staff at this laboratory have so far failed. A few months ago we came across a reference by Kurnick3 to a condition in the human characterized by œdema which was thought to be due to a protein deficiency. In July 1949, Dr. Mitchell, Dominion Pathologist, Canada, visited this laboratory, and he directed our attention to the work carried out by Gwatkin and his associates4 on the protein fraction in the diet of the pig."
