https://openalex.org/W3216448540,"Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and the tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to responses to cytotoxic therapy2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy with or without HER2 (encoded by ERBB2)-targeted therapy before surgery. Pathology end points (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted a pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an area under the curve of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning. This approach could be used to develop predictors for other cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4200022103,"Abstract Immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity and facilitates an accelerated and enhanced immune response upon re-infection with the same pathogen 1,2 . Since the outbreak of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a key question has focused on which SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells stimulated during acute infection give rise to long-lived memory T cells 3 . Here, using spectral flow cytometry combined with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and T cell receptor sequencing, we longitudinally characterized individual SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells of patients with COVID-19 from acute infection to 1 year into recovery and found a distinct signature identifying long-lived memory CD8 + T cells. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8 + T cells persisting 1 year after acute infection express CD45RA, IL-7 receptor-α and T cell factor 1, but they maintain low expression of CCR7, thus resembling CD45RA + effector memory T cells. Tracking individual clones of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8 + T cells, we reveal that an interferon signature marks clones that give rise to long-lived cells, whereas prolonged proliferation and mechanistic target of rapamycin signalling are associated with clonal disappearance from the blood. Collectively, we describe a transcriptional signature that marks long-lived, circulating human memory CD8 + T cells following an acute viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W4200050535,"While intestinal Th17 cells are critical for maintaining tissue homeostasis, recent studies have implicated their roles in the development of extra-intestinal autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which tissue Th17 cells mediate these dichotomous functions remain unknown. Here, we characterized the heterogeneity, plasticity, and migratory phenotypes of tissue Th17 cells in vivo by combined fate mapping with profiling of the transcriptomes and TCR clonotypes of over 84,000 Th17 cells at homeostasis and during CNS autoimmune inflammation. Inter- and intra-organ single-cell analyses revealed a homeostatic, stem-like TCF1+ IL-17+ SLAMF6+ population that traffics to the intestine where it is maintained by the microbiota, providing a ready reservoir for the IL-23-driven generation of encephalitogenic GM-CSF+ IFN-γ+ CXCR6+ T cells. Our study defines a direct in vivo relationship between IL-17+ non-pathogenic and GM-CSF+ and IFN-γ+ pathogenic Th17 populations and provides a mechanism by which homeostatic intestinal Th17 cells direct extra-intestinal autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W4200231439,"The lung is the primary organ targeted by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), making respiratory failure a leading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality. However, our cellular and molecular understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infection drives lung pathology is limited. Here we constructed multi-omics and single-nucleus transcriptomic atlases of the lungs of patients with COVID-19, which integrate histological, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Our work reveals the molecular basis of pathological hallmarks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in different lung and infiltrating immune cell populations. We report molecular fingerprints of hyperinflammation, alveolar epithelial cell exhaustion, vascular changes and fibrosis, and identify parenchymal lung senescence as a molecular state of COVID-19 pathology. Moreover, our data suggest that FOXO3A suppression is a potential mechanism underlying the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition associated with COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. Our work depicts a comprehensive cellular and molecular atlas of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 and provides insights into SARS-CoV-2-related pulmonary injury, facilitating the identification of biomarkers and development of symptomatic treatments. Wang et al. analysed post-mortem samples of the lungs of patients with COVID-19 by bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing along with proteomics and discovered lung senescence as a feature of COVID-19 pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4200574769,"Determining the spatial organization and morphological characteristics of molecularly defined cell types is a major bottleneck for characterizing the architecture underpinning brain function. We developed Expansion-Assisted Iterative Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (EASI-FISH) to survey gene expression in brain tissue, as well as a turnkey computational pipeline to rapidly process large EASI-FISH image datasets. EASI-FISH was optimized for thick brain sections (300 μm) to facilitate reconstruction of spatio-molecular domains that generalize across brains. Using the EASI-FISH pipeline, we investigated the spatial distribution of dozens of molecularly defined cell types in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), a brain region with poorly defined anatomical organization. Mapping cell types in the LHA revealed nine spatially and molecularly defined subregions. EASI-FISH also facilitates iterative reanalysis of scRNA-seq datasets to determine marker-genes that further dissociated spatial and morphological heterogeneity. The EASI-FISH pipeline democratizes mapping molecularly defined cell types, enabling discoveries about brain organization."
https://openalex.org/W4200475530,"Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) is an emerging healthcare burden. The risk factors associated with PACS remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of new or persistent symptoms in COVID-19 patients post hospital discharge and identify associated risk factors.Our prospective cohort comprised of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia between May and July 2020. The patients were interviewed through phone calls by trained physicians from 6 weeks up to 6 months post hospital discharge. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models were used to examine for predictors associated with persistence of symptoms and non-return to baseline health.222 COVID-19 patients responded to follow-up phone interviews after a median of 122 days post discharge. The majority of patients were men (77%) with mean age of 52.47 (± 13.95) years. 56.3% of patients complained of persistent symptoms; 66 (29.7%) experiencing them for >21 days and 64 (28.8%) reporting not having returned to their baseline health. Furthermore, 39 patients (17.6%) reported visiting an emergency room post discharge for COVID-19-related symptoms while 16 (7.2%) had required re-hospitalization. Shortness of breath (40.1%), cough (27.5%) and fatigue (29.7%) were the most frequently reported symptoms at follow-up. After multivariable adjustments, female gender, pre-existing hypertension and length of hospital stay were associated with an increased risk of new or persistent symptoms. Age, pre-existing lung disease and emergency room visits increased the likelihood of not fully recovering from acute COVID-19. Patients who were treated with interferon β-1b based triple antiviral therapy during hospital stay were less likely to experience new or persistent symptoms and more likely to return to their baseline health.COVID-19 survivors continued to suffer from dyspnea, cough and fatigue at 4 months post hospital discharge. Several risk factors could predict which patients are more likely to experience PACS and may benefit from individualized follow-up and rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W4200263842,"The regenerative capacity of neurons is limited in the central nervous system (CNS), with irreversible neuronal loss upon insult. In contrast, microglia exhibit extraordinary capacity for repopulation. Matsuda et al. (2019) recently reported NeuroD1-induced microglia-to-neuron conversion, aiming to provide an ""unlimited"" source to regenerate neurons. However, the extent to which NeuroD1 can exert cross-lineage reprogramming of microglia (myeloid lineage) to neurons (neuroectodermal lineage) is unclear. In this study, we unexpectedly found that NeuroD1 cannot convert microglia to neurons in mice. Instead, NeuroD1 expression induces microglial cell death. Moreover, lineage tracing reveals non-specific leakage of similar lentiviruses as previously used for microglia-to-neuron conversion, which confounds the microglia-to-neuron observation. In summary, we demonstrated that NeuroD1 cannot induce microglia-to-neuron cross-lineage reprogramming. We here propose rigid principles for verifying glia-to-neuron conversion. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Matsuda et al. (2019), published in Neuron."
https://openalex.org/W4200080731,"Simultaneous imaging of various facets of intact biological systems across multiple spatiotemporal scales is a long-standing goal in biology and medicine, for which progress is hindered by limits of conventional imaging modalities. Here we propose using the refractive index (RI), an intrinsic quantity governing light–matter interaction, as a means for such measurement. We show that major endogenous subcellular structures, which are conventionally accessed via exogenous fluorescence labelling, are encoded in three-dimensional (3D) RI tomograms. We decode this information in a data-driven manner, with a deep learning-based model that infers multiple 3D fluorescence tomograms from RI measurements of the corresponding subcellular targets, thereby achieving multiplexed microtomography. This approach, called RI2FL for refractive index to fluorescence, inherits the advantages of both high-specificity fluorescence imaging and label-free RI imaging. Importantly, full 3D modelling of absolute and unbiased RI improves generalization, such that the approach is applicable to a broad range of new samples without retraining to facilitate immediate applicability. The performance, reliability and scalability of this technology are extensively characterized, and its various applications within single-cell profiling at unprecedented scales (which can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses) are demonstrated. Jo et al. develop a broadly applicable deep-learning approach to predict fluorescence (FL) based on label-free refractive index (RI) measurements, ‘RI2FL’ (RI to FL). The trained model can be used across cell types without retraining."
https://openalex.org/W4200201434,"Circadian rhythms align physiological functions with the light–dark cycle through oscillatory changes in the abundance of proteins in the clock transcriptional programme. Timely removal of these proteins by different proteolytic systems is essential to circadian strength and adaptability. Here we show a functional interplay between the circadian clock and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), whereby CMA contributes to the rhythmic removal of clock machinery proteins (selective chronophagy) and to the circadian remodelling of a subset of the cellular proteome. Disruption of this autophagic pathway in vivo leads to temporal shifts and amplitude changes of the clock-dependent transcriptional waves and fragmented circadian patterns, resembling those in sleep disorders and ageing. Conversely, loss of the circadian clock abolishes the rhythmicity of CMA, leading to pronounced changes in the CMA-dependent cellular proteome. Disruption of this circadian clock/CMA axis may be responsible for both pathways malfunctioning in ageing and for the subsequently pronounced proteostasis defect. Juste, Kaushik and co-workers show that the circadian regulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy orchestrates the degradation of clock components and contributes to the circadian remodelling of the proteome."

https://openalex.org/W4200460998,"Research suggests that smoking may compound the risk of serious health problems to smokers who contract COVID-19. This study examines whether and how exposure to news stories reporting the severe COVID-19 risk to smokers may influence smokers' emotional responses (fear, anxiety, and sadness) and intentions to take measures to quit smoking. Current smokers in the US participated in an online experiment (N = 495) and were randomized to read smoking risk news stories or news stories reporting the combined risk of smoking and COVID-19. We found that combined risk news stories lead to participants feeling more fearful and sadder than when they viewed smoking risk news stories (M = 5.74; SD = 2.57 vs. M = 5.20; SD = 2.74; p < .05). Fear fully mediated the effect of news exposure on intentions to take measures to quit smoking (ß = .09; SE = 05; 95% CI [.010, .200]). Moreover, moderated-mediation analyses revealed that the mediating effect of fear was conditioned on the levels of comparative optimism, such that the association between fear and intentions to take measures to quit smoking was only significant among smokers whose comparative optimism was at the mean score (ß = .16; SE = 05; 95% CI [.071, .250]), and for those whose comparative optimism was high (ß = .27; SE = .06; 95% CI [.146, .395]). These results suggest that fear of the pandemic and optimism might play important roles in predicting and explaining the association between exposure to news stories and intentions to take measures to quit smoking. Messages about heightened risk of COVID-19 complications for smokers that increase fear might be an effective strategy to motivate smokers to quit. Such messages should be used to turn the adversity of COVID-19 pandemic into an intervention opportunity to reduce tobacco-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W4200184228,"Somatic mutations have a central role in cancer but their role in other diseases such as common autoimmune disorders is not clear. Previously we and others have demonstrated that especially CD8+ T cells in blood can harbor persistent somatic mutations in some patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis. Here we concentrated on CD8+ cells in more detail and tested (i) how commonly somatic mutations are detectable, (ii) does the overall mutation load differ between MS patients and controls, and (iii) do the somatic mutations accumulate non-randomly in certain genes? We separated peripheral blood CD8+ cells from newly diagnosed relapsing MS patients (n = 21) as well as matched controls (n = 21) and performed next-generation sequencing of the CD8+ cells' DNA, limiting our search to a custom panel of 2524 immunity and cancer related genes, which enabled us to obtain a median sequencing depth of over 2000x. We discovered nonsynonymous somatic mutations in all MS patients' and controls' CD8+ cell DNA samples, with no significant difference in number between the groups (p = 0.60), at a median allelic fraction of 0.5% (range 0.2-8.6%). The mutations showed statistically significant clustering especially to the STAT3 gene, and also enrichment to the SMARCA2, DNMT3A, SOCS1 and PPP3CA genes. Known activating STAT3 mutations were found both in MS patients and controls and overall 1/5 of the mutations were previously described cancer mutations. The detected clustering suggests a selection advantage of the mutated CD8+ clones and calls for further research on possible phenotypic effects."
https://openalex.org/W4200240829,"Because no currently available vaccine can prevent HIV infection, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretrovirals (ARVs) is an important tool for combating the HIV pandemic1,2. Long-acting ARVs promise to build on the success of current PrEP strategies, which must be taken daily, by reducing the frequency of administration3. GS-CA1 is a small-molecule HIV capsid inhibitor with picomolar antiviral potency against a broad array of HIV strains, including variants resistant to existing ARVs, and has shown long-acting therapeutic potential in a mouse model of HIV infection4. Here we show that a single subcutaneous administration of GS-CA1 provides long-term protection against repeated rectal simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) challenges in rhesus macaques. Whereas all control animals became infected after 15 weekly challenges, a single 300 mg kg-1 dose of GS-CA1 provided per-exposure infection risk reduction of 97% for 24 weeks. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a correlation between GS-CA1 plasma concentration and protection from SHIV challenges. GS-CA1 levels greater than twice the rhesus plasma protein-adjusted 95% effective concentration conferred 100% protection in this model. These proof-of-concept data support the development of capsid inhibitors as a novel long-acting PrEP strategy in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3172422226,"Strategies adopted globally to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 have primarily involved lockdown measures with substantial economic and social costs with varying degrees of success. Morbidity patterns of COVID-19 variants have a strong association with age, while restrictive lockdown measures have association with negative mental health outcomes in some age groups. Reduced economic prospects may also afflict some age cohorts more than others. Motivated by this, we propose a model to describe COVID-19 community spread incorporating the role of age-specific social interactions. Through a flexible parameterisation of an age-structured deterministic Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) model, we provide a means for characterising different forms of lockdown which may impact specific age groups differently. Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact matrices, which can be trained using available data and are thus locally adapted. This framework is easy to interpret and suitable for describing counterfactual scenarios, which could assist policy makers with regard to minimising morbidity balanced with the costs of prospective suppression strategies. Our work originates from an Irish context and we use disease monitoring data from February 29th 2020 to January 31st 2021 gathered by Irish governmental agencies. We demonstrate how Irish lockdown scenarios can be constructed using the proposed model formulation and show results of retrospective fitting to incidence rates and forward planning with relevant ""what if / instead of"" lockdown counterfactuals. Uncertainty quantification for the predictive approaches is described. Our formulation is agnostic to a specific locale, in that lockdown strategies in other regions can be straightforwardly encoded using this model."
https://openalex.org/W4226248064,"Reactions to danger have been depicted as antisocial but research has shown that supportive behaviors (e.g., helping injured others, giving information or reassuring others) prevail in life-threatening circumstances. Why is it so? Previous accounts have put the emphasis on the role of psychosocial factors, such as the maintenance of social norms or the degree of identification between hostages. Other determinants, such as the possibility to escape and distance to danger may also greatly contribute to shaping people's reactions to deadly danger. To examine the role of those specific physical constraints, we interviewed 32 survivors of the attacks at 'Le Bataclan' (on the evening of 13-11-2015 in Paris, France). Consistent with previous findings, supportive behaviors were frequently reported. We also found that impossibility to egress, minimal protection from danger and interpersonal closeness with other crowd members were associated with higher report of supportive behaviors. As we delved into the motives behind reported supportive behaviors, we found that they were mostly described as manifesting cooperative (benefits for both interactants) or altruistic (benefits for other(s) at cost for oneself) tendencies, rather than individualistic (benefits for oneself at cost for other(s)) ones. Our results show that supportive behaviors occur during mass shootings, particularly if people cannot escape, are under minimal protection from the danger, and feel interpersonal closeness with others. Crucially, supportive behaviors underpin a diversity of motives. This last finding calls for a clear-cut distinction between the social strategies people use when exposed to deadly danger, and the psychological motivations underlying them."
https://openalex.org/W4200275329,"Defective silencing of retrotransposable elements has been linked to inflammageing, cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we implicate the histone H3.3 chaperone Daxx, a retrotransposable element repressor inactivated in myeloid leukaemia and other neoplasms, in protection from inflammatory disease. Loss of Daxx alters the chromatin landscape, H3.3 distribution and histone marks of haematopoietic progenitors, leading to engagement of a Pu.1-dependent transcriptional programme for myelopoiesis at the expense of B-cell differentiation. This causes neutrophilia and inflammation, predisposing mice to develop an autoinflammatory skin disease. While these molecular and phenotypic perturbations are in part reverted in animals lacking both Pu.1 and Daxx, haematopoietic progenitors in these mice show unique chromatin and transcriptome alterations, suggesting an interaction between these two pathways. Overall, our findings implicate retrotransposable element silencing in haematopoiesis and suggest a cross-talk between the H3.3 loading machinery and the pioneer transcription factor Pu.1."
https://openalex.org/W4200338362,"The automobile industry contributes significantly to global energy use and carbon emissions. Hence, there are significant economic and environmental benefits in recovering materials from end-of-life vehicles (ELVs). Here, the remanufacturing of waste steel sheet (WSS) from ELVs into useful mesh steel sheet (MSS) for metal forming applications was evaluated based on its technological, economic, and environmental feasibility. A remanufacturing plant with a dismantling capacity of over 30,171 ELV/year and a recovery capacity of 1000 m 2 /d of WSS was used as a case study. Remanufacturing can achieve a total reduction of ~3800 kg CO 2 /ELV and an economic benefit of ~775 USD/ELV compared with conventional recycling. The calculated feasibility indexes were similar to or exceeded standard feasibility thresholds, indicating that WSS remanufacturing is a viable sustainable development route and has synergistic benefits when combined with existing recycling plants, especially in developing countries as small-to-medium enterprises."
https://openalex.org/W4200498978,"This article proposes a study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread and the efficacy of public policies in Brazil. Using both aggregated (from large Internet companies) and fine-grained (from Departments of Motor Vehicles) mobility data sources, our work sheds light on the effect of mobility on the pandemic situation in the Brazilian territory. Our main contribution is to show how mobility data, particularly fine-grained ones, can offer valuable insights into virus propagation. For this, we propose a modification in the SENUR model to add mobility information, evaluating different data availability scenarios (different information granularities), and finally, we carry out simulations to evaluate possible public policies. In particular, we conduct a case study that shows, through simulations of hypothetical scenarios, that the contagion curve in several Brazilian cities could have been milder if the government had imposed mobility restrictions soon after reporting the first case. Our results also show that if the government had not taken any action and the only safety measure taken was the population's voluntary isolation (out of fear), the time until the contagion peak for the first wave would have been postponed, but its value would more than double."
https://openalex.org/W4200308595,"Objective Despite those efforts in expanded programs of immunization, nearly one fifth of children in developing countries miss out basic vaccines. Moreover, many children who started vaccination fail to complete immunization.Identifying associated factorswhich is scarce in the study area, is crucial for interventions. This study assessed full-immunization and associated factors among children aged 12–23 months in Somali region, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from October 1–30, 2018, in selected rural and urban kebeles in Somali regionamong 612 children. Cluster sampling was employed and data was collected using structured questionnaire. Full-immunization was measured by maternal recall and vaccination card.Data entry and analysis was done by EpiData3.1 and SPSSversion.20 respectively. Binary logistic regression with Bivariate and Multivariable model was usedto identify predictors of full-immunization. Odd ratios were computed and P-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Based on maternal recall plus vaccination card 249(41.4%) of children were completed immunization, while vaccination only by card was 87(29.7%). Only 238(39.5%) of participants had good knowledge about vaccination. Not knowing to come back for next visits 197(55.8%) were the major reason for dropout. Residing in urban (AOR = 2.0, 95%CI: 1.0, 3.9),primary educated mothers(AOR = 2.2, 95%CI: 1.0, 5.0), married mothers (AOR = 4.2, 95%CI:1.0, 18), higher average monthly income (AOR = 2.5, 95%CI 1.1, 5.2)and delivered at health facilities (AOR = 3.8, 95%CI 1.9, 7.3)were significantly associated with full-immunization. Conclusion Coverage of full immunization was found to be low compared to the targets set in the Global Vaccine Action Plan(2011–2020).Two-third of the participants has poor knowledge about vaccination. Urban residence, mother education, higher family income, male child and institutional delivery were factors. This study suggests that awareness creation, behaviour change on vaccination and enhancing utilization of maternal health service including delivery service, should be stressed."
https://openalex.org/W4200078707,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects almost 2% of the population above the age of 65. To better quantify the effects of new medications, fast and objective methods are needed. Touchscreen-based tapping tasks are simple yet effective tools for quantifying drug effects on PD-related motor symptoms, especially bradykinesia. However, there is no consensus on the optimal task set-up. The present study compares four tapping tasks in 14 healthy participants. In alternate finger tapping (AFT), tapping occurred with the index and middle finger with 2.5 cm between targets, whereas in alternate side tapping (AST) the index finger with 20 cm between targets was used. Both configurations were tested with or without the presence of a visual cue. Moreover, for each tapping task, within- and between-day repeatability and (potential) sensitivity of the calculated parameters were assessed. Visual cueing reduced tapping speed and rhythm, and improved accuracy. This effect was most pronounced for AST. On average, AST had a lower tapping speed with impaired accuracy and improved rhythm compared to AFT. Of all parameters, the total number of taps and mean spatial error had the highest repeatability and sensitivity. The findings suggest against the use of visual cueing because it is crucial that parameters can vary freely to accurately capture medication effects. The choice for AFT or AST depends on the research question, as these tasks assess different aspects of movement. These results encourage further validation of non-cued AFT and AST in PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W4200299387,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common feline endocrinopathy, which is similar to human type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in terms of its pathophysiology. T2DM occurs due to peripheral insulin resistance and/or β-cell dysfunction. Several studies have identified genetic and environmental factors that contribute to susceptibility to human T2DM. In cats, environmental factors such as obesity and physical inactivity have been linked with DM, although to date, the only genetic association that has been demonstrated is with a polymorphism in the feline MC4R gene. The aim of this study was to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify polymorphisms associated with feline DM. Illumina Infinium 63k iSelect DNA arrays were used to analyse genomic DNA samples from 200 diabetic domestic shorthair cats and 399 non-diabetic control cats. Data was analysed using PLINK whole genome data analysis toolset. A linear model analysis, EMMAX, was done to test for population structure and HAPLOVIEW was used to identify haplotype blocks surrounding the significant SNPs to assist with candidate gene nomination. A total of 47,497 SNPs were available for analysis. Four SNPs were identified with genome-wide significance: chrA2.4150731 (praw = 9.94 x10-8); chrUn17.115508 (praw = 6.51 x10-8); chrUn17.394136 (praw = 2.53 x10-8); chrUn17.314128 (praw = 2.53 x10-8) as being associated with DM. The first SNP is located within chromosome A2, less than 4kb upstream of the dipeptidyl-peptidase-9 (DPP9) gene, a peptidase involved in incretin inactivation. The remaining three SNPs are located within a haplotype block towards the end of chromosome A3; within this region, genes of interest include TMEM18 and ACP1, both previously associated with T2DM. This study indicates a polygenic component to susceptibility to DM in cats and has highlighted several loci and candidate genes worthy of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4200046226,"Candida albicans is the leading cause of life-threatening bloodstream candidiasis, especially among immunocompromised patients. The reversible morphological transition from yeast to hyphal filaments in response to host environmental cues facilitates C. albicans tissue invasion, immune evasion, and dissemination. Hence, it is widely considered that filamentation represents one of the major virulence properties in C. albicans. We have previously characterized Ppg1, a PP2A-type protein phosphatase that controls filament extension and virulence in C. albicans. This study conducted RNA sequencing analysis of samples obtained from C. albicans wild type and ppg1Δ/Δ strains grown under filament-inducing conditions. Overall, ppg1Δ/Δ strain showed 1448 upregulated and 710 downregulated genes, representing approximately one-third of the entire annotated C. albicans genome. Transcriptomic analysis identified significant downregulation of well-characterized genes linked to filamentation and virulence, such as ALS3, HWP1, ECE1, and RBT1. Expression analysis showed that essential genes involved in C. albicans central carbon metabolisms, including GDH3, GPD1, GPD2, RHR2, INO1, AAH1, and MET14 were among the top upregulated genes. Subsequent metabolomics analysis of C. albicans ppg1Δ/Δ strain revealed a negative enrichment of metabolites with carboxylic acid substituents and a positive enrichment of metabolites with pyranose substituents. Altogether, Ppg1 in vitro analysis revealed a link between metabolites substituents and filament formation controlled by a phosphatase to regulate morphogenesis and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W4200067218,"Introduction The attitudes of healthcare staff towards patients’ safety, including awareness of the risk for adverse events, are significant elements of an organization’s safety culture. Aim of research To evaluate nurses and physicians’ attitudes towards factors influencing hospitalized patient safety. Materials and methods The research included 606 nurses and 527 physicians employed in surgical and medical wards in 21 Polish hospitals around the country. The Polish adaptation of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) was used to evaluate the factors influencing attitudes towards patient safety. Results Both nurses and physicians scored highest in stress recognition (SR) (71.6 and 80.86), while they evaluated working conditions (WC) the lowest (45.82 and 52,09). Nurses achieved statistically significantly lower scores compared to physicians in every aspect of the safety attitudes evaluation (p&lt;0.05). The staff working in surgical wards obtained higher scores within stress recognition (SR) compared to the staff working in medical wards (78.12 vs. 73.72; p = 0.001). Overall, positive working conditions and effective teamwork can contribute to improving employees’ attitudes towards patient safety. Conclusions The results help identify unit level vulnerabilities associated with staff attitudes toward patient safety. They underscore the importance of management strategies that account for staff coping with occupational stressors to improve patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W4200162530,"This cross-sectional study sought to identify gender differences in individual behavioral attitudes, personal traits, and entrepreneurial education based on planned behavior theory. The Smart partial least squares (PLS) structural equation model and PLS path modeling were used. A survey design was used to collect data from 309 samples using quantitative measures. The model was tested for validity and reliability and showed variance (full, R2 = 58.9% and split, R2 = 62.7% and R2 = 52.7%) in male and female model predictive power, respectively. Subjective norms (SN), personality traits (PT), and entrepreneurial education (EE) significantly impacted the male sample's intention. Females' intentions toward entrepreneurship was less affected by attitude toward behavior (ATB), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and entrepreneurship education (EE). Further, attitudes, social norms, and behavioral controls as mediation variables indicate a significant and positive role of male and female intentions. These findings imply that behavioral beliefs (ATB, PBC, and SN) influence entrepreneurial intention-action translation. The results significantly supported the designed hypotheses and shed light on individual personality traits (PT) and entrepreneurship education (EE) underpinning enterprise intention. The study determined that EE and PT are the strongest predictors of intention, thus highlighting the role of these motives in the entrepreneurial process. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on youth entrepreneurs, expands our understanding of entrepreneurship as a practical career choice, and offers a novel account differentiating male and female PT. The drive to evaluate the effects of entrepreneurial intention among budding disparities in Pakistan requires a more profound knowledge of the aspects that endorse entrepreneurship as a choice of profession and enhances youth incentive abilities to engage in entrepreneurial activities based on exploitation."

Here, we first explored changes in coral juvenile abundance across three locations (lagoon, seaward west and east) at remote Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles) between 2015 and 2019, which spanned the 2015/16 global coral bleaching event. Secondly, we measured variation in coral recruit abundance on settlement tiles from two sites (lagoon, seaward reef) during August 2018-August 2019. Juvenile abundance decreased from 14.1 ± 1.2 to 7.4 ± 0.5 colonies m-2 (mean ± SE) during 2015-2016 and increased to 22.4 ± 1.2 colonies m-2 during 2016-2019. Whilst juvenile abundance increased two- to three-fold at the lagoonal and seaward western sites during 2016-2018 (from 7.7-8.3 to 17.3-24.7 colonies m-2), increases at the seaward eastern sites occurred later (2018-2019; from 5.8-6.9 to 16.6-24.1 colonies m-2). The composition of coral recruits on settlement tiles was dominated by Pocilloporidae (64-92% of all recruits), and recruit abundance was 7- to 47-fold higher inside than outside the lagoon. Recruit abundance was highest in October-December 2018 (2164 ± 453 recruits m-2) and lowest in June-August 2019 (240 ± 98 recruits m-2). As Acroporid recruit abundance corresponded to this trend, the results suggest that broadcast spawning occurred during October-December, when water temperature increased from 26 to 29°C. This study provides the first published record on coral recruit abundance in the Seychelles Outer Islands, indicates a rapid (2-3 years) increase of juvenile corals following a bleaching event, and provides crucial baseline data for future research on reef resilience and connectivity within the region."
https://openalex.org/W4226138377,"Structural characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 full length nsp1 protein will be an essential tool for developing new target-directed antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 and for further understanding of intra- and intermolecular interactions of this protein. As a first step in the NMR studies of the protein, we report the 1 H, 13 C and 15 N resonance backbone assignment as well as the Cβ of the apo form of the full-lengthSARS-CoV-2 nsp1 including the folded domain together with the flaking N- and C- terminal intrinsically disordered fragments. The 19.8 kD protein was characterized by high-resolution NMR. Validation of assignment have been done by using two different mutants, H81P and K129E/D48E as well as by amino acid specific experiments. According to the obtained assignment, the secondary structure of the folded domain in solution was almost identical to its previously published X-ray structure as well as another published secondary structure obtained by NMR, but some discrepancies have been detected. In the solution SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 exhibited disordered, flexible N- and C-termini with different dynamic characteristics. The short peptide in the beginning of the disordered C-terminal domain adopted two different conformations distinguishable on the NMR time scale. We propose that the disordered and folded nsp1 domains are not fully independent units but are rather involved in intramolecular interactions. Studies of the structure and dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 mutant in solution are on-going and will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4200205877,"Endothelial cells play an essential role in inflammation through synthesis and secretion of chemoattractant cytokines and expression of adhesion molecules required for inflammatory cell attachment and infiltration. The mechanisms by which endothelial cells control the pro-inflammatory response depend on the type of inflammatory stimuli, endothelial cell origin, and tissue involved. In the present study, we investigated the role of the transcription factor c-Myc in inflammation using a conditional knockout mouse model in which Myc is specifically deleted in the endothelium. At a systemic level, circulating monocytes, the chemokine CCL7, and the extracellular-matrix protein osteopontin were significantly increased in endothelial c-Myc knockout (EC-Myc KO) mice, whereas the cytokine TNFSF11 was downregulated. Using an experimental model of steatohepatitis, we investigated the involvement of endothelial c-Myc in diet-induced inflammation. EC-Myc KO animals displayed enhanced pro-inflammatory response, characterized by increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte infiltration, and worsened liver fibrosis. Transcriptome analysis identified enhanced expression of genes associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in EC-Myc KO mice relative to control (CT) animals after short-exposure to high-fat diet. Analysis of a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset of human cirrhotic livers indicated downregulation of MYC in endothelial cells relative to healthy controls. In summary, our results suggest a protective role of endothelial c-Myc in diet-induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Targeting c-Myc and its downstream pathways in the endothelium may constitute a potential strategy for the treatment of inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W4200214537,"Programs referred to as Fast-Track/Rapid Recovery/Enhanced Recovery After Surgery have proven both effective and safe in joint replacement surgery, to the degree where same-day discharge (SDD) has been attempted in carefully selected cases at specialized outpatient units. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate a same-day surgery protocol regarding safety using the minor partial knee replacement (PKR) procedure by non-selectively recruiting patients at a public hospital for one consecutive year.33 unselected PKR cases were included in this open clinical trial. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were solely based on logistics, as all the procedures were medial PKRs, designated the first morning slots, and performed by one single-surgeon. Strict postoperative criteria based on vital parameters, urinary function, bleeding, and mobilization had to be met before discharge was considered. SDD rate, patient satisfaction, number of outpatient visits, adverse events and readmissions within 90 days were evaluated. A predetermined subgroup analysis was also conducted where patients <80 yrs. and with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification <III was compared with those aged ≥80 yrs. and/or ASA class ≥III.29 of 33 (88%) successfully achieved SDD. In a univariate comparison, 100% of the patients <80 yrs. and ASA class <III achieved SDD, whereas a corresponding 43% applied for those aged ≥80 yrs. and/or ASA class ≥III (p = 0.001). A 93% overall satisfaction rate was reached. Only 8% extra outpatient visits were required, all occurring within the first 2 weeks (well in line with routine practice.) One plausible transient ischemic attack and one readmission caused by a penetrating trauma not affecting the knee were identified, both of which happened 10 weeks after surgery. No adverse events or readmissions occurred within the first 48 hours of surgery.When following strict criteria for discharge, same-day partial knee replacement surgery may be both feasible and safe, even without preselection of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4200225065,"Understanding how textual information impacts financial market volatility has been one of the growing topics in financial econometric research. In this paper, we aim to examine the relationship between the volatility measure that is extracted from GARCH modelling and textual news information both publicly available and from subscription, and the performances of the two datasets are compared. We utilize a latent Dirichlet allocation method to capture the dynamic features of the textual data overtime by summarizing their statistical outputs, such as topic distributions in documents and word distributions in topics. In addition, we transform various measures representing the popularity and diversity of topics to form predictors for a rolling regression model to assess the usefulness of textual information. The proposed method captures the statistical properties of textual information over different time periods and its performance is evaluated in an out-of-sample analysis. Our results show that the topic measures are more useful for predicting our volatility proxy, the unexplained variance from the GARCH model than the simple moving average. The finding indicates that our method is helpful in extracting significant textual information to improve the prediction of stock market volatility."
https://openalex.org/W4200357366,"Analysis of consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable foods produced using new agri-food technologies is required to enhance the uptake of innovations that accelerate the transition towards sustainable food systems. Consumers’ willingness to buy new food products, with no or limited consumption experience, mainly depends on their food choice motivational orientations (promotion- vs prevention-orientation). The objective of this study was to elicit consumers’ WTP for foods that are produced with microbial applications during the plant production phase with the aim to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals in crop farming, as well as to understand the associations of food choice motives, personal and socio-demographic factors with the WTP. We used contingent valuation to elicit consumers’ WTP for three food products (wheat bread, consumer potatoes and tomato sauce) through online surveys. Data were collected from 291 consumers, primarily from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Descriptive statistics, latent variable modelling and logistic regression were used to analysis data. Results show that more than two-third of the respondents are willing to pay premiums of at least 0.11 euro per kg of food products for reductions in synthetic chemical use by at least 50% due to microbial applications. The amount of WTP increases with the level of reductions in synthetic chemical use. The majority of the respondents are promotion-oriented consumers in relation to their food involvement, and are more likely to pay premiums for the sustainably produced food products. Environmentally concerned consumers are also more likely to pay premiums, whereas health concerned consumers are not. This study contributes to understanding of consumers’ attitude and perceived health risks towards foods obtained using microbial applications, and the heterogeneity of their preferences. Results provide insights for identifying potential buyers of foods produced using microbial applications, and to set prices according to the levels of consumers’ WTP."
https://openalex.org/W4200385940,"Previous studies have revealed that gypenosides produced from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino are mainly dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins with diverse structures and important biological activities, but the mechanism of diversity for gypenoside biosynthesis is still unclear. In this study, a combination of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) proteome analysis and RNA sequencing transcriptome analysis was performed to identify the proteins and genes related to gypenoside biosynthesis. A total of 3925 proteins were identified by proteomic sequencing, of which 2537 were quantified. Seventeen cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 11 uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, UGT) candidate genes involved in the side chain synthesis and modification of gypenosides were found. Seven putative CYPs (CYP71B19, CYP77A3, CYP86A7, CYP86A8, CYP89A2, CYP90A1, CYP94A1) and five putative UGTs (UGT73B4, UGT76B1, UGT74F2, UGT91C1 and UGT91A1) were selected as candidate structural modifiers of triterpenoid saponins, which were cloned for gene expression analysis. Comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing and proteome sequencing showed that some CYPs and UGTs were found at both the transcription and translation levels. In this study, an expression analysis of 7 CYPs and 5 UGTs that contributed to gypenoside biosynthesis and distribution in G. pentaphyllum was performed, providing consistent results that will inspire more future research on vital genes/proteins involved in gypenoside biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4200545972,"Objective Conditions defined by persistent “medically unexplained” physical symptoms and syndromes (MUS) are common and disabling. Veterans from the Gulf War (deployed 1990–1991) have notably high prevalence and disability from MUS conditions. Individuals with MUS report that providers do not recognize their MUS conditions. Our goal was to determine if Veterans with MUS receive an ICD-10 diagnosis for a MUS condition or receive disability benefits available to them for these conditions. Methods A chart review was conducted with US Veterans who met case criteria for Gulf War Illness, a complex MUS condition ( N = 204, M = 53 years-old, SD = 7). Three coders independently reviewed Veteran’s medical records for MUS condition diagnosis or service-connection along with comorbid mental and physical health conditions. Service-connection refers to US Veterans Affairs disability benefits eligibility for conditions or injuries experienced during or exacerbated by military service. Results Twenty-nine percent had a diagnosis of a MUS condition in their medical record, the most common were irritable colon/irritable bowel syndrome (16%) and fibromyalgia (11%). Slightly more Veterans were service-connected for a MUS condition (38%) as compared to diagnosed. There were high rates of diagnoses and service-connection for mental health (diagnoses 76% and service-connection 74%), musculoskeletal (diagnoses 86%, service-connection 79%), and illness-related conditions (diagnoses 98%, service-connection 49%). Conclusion Given that all participants were Gulf War Veterans who met criteria for a MUS condition, our results suggest that MUS conditions in Gulf War Veterans are under-recognized with regard to clinical diagnosis and service-connected disability. Veterans were more likely to be diagnosed and service-connected for musculoskeletal-related and mental health conditions than MUS conditions. Providers may need education and training to facilitate diagnosis of and service-connection for MUS conditions. We believe that greater acknowledgement and validation of MUS conditions would increase patient engagement with healthcare as well as provider and patient satisfaction with care."
https://openalex.org/W4225641529,"Studies of the hippocampus use smaller voxel sizes and smoothing kernels than cortical activation studies, typically using a multivoxel seed with specified radius for connectivity analysis. This study identified optimal processing parameters for evaluating hippocampal connectivity with sensorimotor cortex (SMC), comparing effectiveness by varying parameters during both activation and connectivity analysis. Using both 3mm and 4mm isovoxels, smoothing kernels of 0-10mm were evaluated on the amplitude and extent of motor activation and hippocampal connectivity with SMC. Psychophysiological interactions (PPI) identified hippocampal connectivity with SMC during volitional movements, and connectivity effects from multivoxel seeds were compared with alternate methods; a structural seed represented the mean connectivity map from all voxels within a region, whereas a functional seed represented the regional voxel with maximal SMC connectivity. With few exceptions, the same parameters were optimal for activation and connectivity. Larger isovoxels showed larger activation volumes in both SMC and the hippocampus; connectivity volumes from structural seeds were also larger, except from the posterior hippocampus. Regardless of voxel size, the 10mm smoothing kernel generated larger activation and connectivity volumes from structural seeds, as well as larger beta estimates at connectivity maxima; structural seeds also produced larger connectivity volumes than multivoxel seeds. Functional seeds showed lesser effects from voxel size and smoothing kernels. Optimal parameters revealed topography in structural seed connectivity along both the longitudinal axis and mediolateral axis of the hippocampus. These results indicate larger voxels and smoothing kernels can improve sensitivity for detecting both cortical activation and hippocampal connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4200092047,"Humor is crucial for social development. Despite this, very few studies have examined the neurodevelopment of humor in very young children, and none to date have used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study this important cognitive construct. The main aim of the current study was to characterize the neural basis of humor processing in young children between the ages of 6–8 years. Thirty-five healthy children (6–8 years old) watched funny and neutral video clips while undergoing fNIRS imaging. We observed activation increases in left temporo-occipito-parietal junction (TOPJ), inferior-parietal lobe (IPL), dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior parietal lobe (SPL) regions. Activation in left TOPJ was positively correlated with age. In addition, we found that coherence increased in humor viewing compared to neutral content, mainly between remote regions. This effect was different for boys and girls, as boys showed a more pronounced increase in coherence for funny compared to neutral videos, more so in frontoparietal networks. These results expand our understanding of the neurodevelopment of humor by highlighting the effect of age on the neural basis of humor appreciation as well as emphasizing different developmental trajectories of boys and girls."
https://openalex.org/W4200340486,"Nuanced public responses to droughts and other chronic environmental crises reflect today's increasingly complex communication ecosystem. At once global and infinitely customizable, this vast array of media and information channels requires existing theory to address the implications of interactions among social media, ""traditional"" mass media outlets, and information-seeking tools such as search engines. How do these channels intervene in public conversation? What might the agenda-setting perspective have to say? Data collected during peak years of the California drought, 2013-2015, indicate that California residents responded to worsening drought conditions Twitter first, which was the only media behavior directly stimulated by environmental stressors. Google searches stimulated newspaper coverage and Twitter activity, revealing the centrality of search behaviors in this environmental crisis. The findings suggest significant changes to the communication landscape as individual and collective users become increasingly dependent on non-mainstream media channels for information in chronic crisis situations."
https://openalex.org/W4200352404,"Introduction Work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD) is a leading causes of occupational injury and disability among drivers and workers in the transport industry. This study evaluated the ergonomically assessed WMSD and its determinants among Nigerian commercial mini bus drivers (BD) and mini bus conductors (BC) Method A total of 379 participants (BD = 200, BC = 179) were purposively sampled for this exploratory cross-sectional study. Participants’ WMSD and work related variables were respectively assessed using the standardized Nordic questionnaire and a content-validated, Driving Work Station Assessment (DWSA) form. Data were analyzed descriptively and inferentially using chi-square and logistic regression. The level of significance was set at α = 0.05. Results The participants were aged between 20 and 66 years, with a mean age of 33.26±10.76years (BD = 38.42±10.22years, BC = 27.50±8.13years); most of whom consumed alcohol (84.4%) and experienced severe job stress (73.4%). There was a high prevalence (95.8%; BD = 94.5%, BC = 97.8%) of WMSDs, the lower back (66.8%) and upper back (54.1%) had the highest regional prevalence of WMSD. The BC (BC vs BD) had significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher prevalence of Neck (47.7% vs 21.5%) and upper back (80.4% vs 30.5%) WMSDs. Conversely, the BD (BD vs BC) had significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher prevalence of low-back (85.0% vs 46.4%), knee (25.0% vs 9.5%), elbow (11.5% vs 3.9%), and wrist (10.5% vs 3.4%) WMSD. There was a significant association between WMSD and each of work duration (X 2 = 11.634, p = 0.009), work frequency (X 2 = 8.394, p = 0.039), job dissatisfaction (X2 = 10.620, p = 0.001) and job stress (X 2 = 16.879, p = 0.001). Working beyond 4days/week (OR = 10.019, p = 0.001), job dissatisfaction (OR = 1.990, p = 0.031), constrained working postures (OR = 5.324, p = 0.003) and fatigue (OR = 4.719, p = 0.002) were the predictors of WMSD. Conclusion Job stress, work duration and work frequency, posture and fatigue are important determinants of WMSDs among mini bus drivers and their assistants in Nigeria. Ergonomics training intervention for this population is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4200391262,"Studies suggest that transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (TransPRK) with the all-surface laser ablation (ASLA)-SCHWIND platform is effective and safe for both low-moderate myopia and high myopia. In most studies, mitomycin-C is administered immediately after surgery to prevent corneal opacification (haze), which is a significant complication of photorefractive keratectomy in general. However, there is evidence that adjuvant mitomycin-C induces endothelial cytotoxicity. Moreover, a recent study showed that omitting adjuvant mitomycin-C did not increase haze in low-moderate myopia. The present case-series study examined the efficacy, safety, and haze rates of eyes with high myopia that underwent ASLA-SCHWIND TransPRK without adjuvant mitomycin-C.All consecutive eyes with high myopia (≤-6 D) that were treated in 2018-2020 with the SCHWIND Amaris 500E® TransPRK excimer laser without adjuvant mitomycin-C in a tertiary-care hospital (France) and were followed up for 6 months were identified. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), and spherical equivalent (SE) were recorded before and after surgery. Postoperative haze was graded using the 4-grade Fantes scale. Efficacy rate (frequency of eyes with 6-month UCVA ≤0.1 logMAR), safety rate (frequency of eyes that lost <2 BSCVA lines), predictability (frequency of eyes with 6-month SE equal to target SE±0.5 D), efficacy index (mean UCVA at 6 months/preoperative BSCVA), and safety index (BSCVA at 6 months/preoperative BSCVA) were computed.Sixty-nine eyes (38 patients) were included. Mean preoperative and 6-month SE were -7.44 and -0.05 D, respectively. Mean 6-month UCVA and BSCVA were 0.00 and -0.02 logMAR, respectively. Efficacy rate and index were 95.7% and 1.08, respectively. Safety rate and index were 95.7% and 1.13, respectively. Predictability was 85.5%. Grade 3-4 haze never arose. At 6 months, the haze rate was zero.ASLA-SCHWIND TransPRK without mitomycin-C appears to be safe as well as effective and accurate for high myopia."
https://openalex.org/W4200463131,"Although there has been extensive research on pharmaceutical industry payments to healthcare professionals, healthcare organisations with key roles in health systems have received little attention. We seek to contribute to addressing this gap in research by examining drug company payments to General Practices in England in 2015. We combine a publicly available payments database managed by the pharmaceutical industry with datasets covering key practice characteristics. We find that practices were an important target of company payments, receiving £2,726,018, equivalent to 6.5% of the value of payments to all healthcare organisations in England. Payments to practices were highly concentrated and specific companies were also highly dominant. The top 10 donors and the top 10 recipients amassed 87.9% and 13.6% of the value of payments, respectively. Practices with more patients, a greater proportion of elderly patients, and those in more affluent areas received significantly more payments on average. However, the patterns of payments were similar across England's regions. We also found that company networks-established by making payments to the same practices-were largely dominated by a single company, which was also by far the biggest donor. Greater policy attention is required to the risk of financial dependency and conflicts of interests that might arise from payments to practices and to organisational conflicts of interests more broadly. Our research also demonstrates that the comprehensiveness and quality of payment data disclosed via industry self-regulatory arrangements needs improvement. More interconnectivity between payment data and other datasets is needed to capture company marketing strategies systematically."

Renal infarction (RI) is a very rare disease, and many RI patients complain of flank pain. However, there is no definitive predictor of RI when patients complain of flank pain. This study aimed to identify the clinical factors for predicting RI in patients with flank pain.This retrospective single-center study was conducted on patients complaining of flank pain from January 2016 to March 2020 at a South Korean tertiary care hospital. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography, age < 18 years, and trauma. Demographic and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of RI occurrence.In all, 2,131 patients were enrolled, and 39 (1.8%) had RI. From a multivariable logistic regression analysis, an age ≥ 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.249; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.366-7.725; p = 0.008), male sex (OR, 2.846; 95% CI, 1.190-6.808; p = 0.019), atrial fibrillation (OR, 10.386; 95% CI, 3.724-28.961; p < 0.001), current smoker (OR, 10.022; 95% CI, 4.565-22.001; p < 0.001), and no hematuria (OR, 0.267; 95% CI, 0.114-0.628; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with the occurrence of RI.Five clinical factors, i.e., age ≥ 65 years, male sex, atrial fibrillation, current smoker, and no hematuria, were significantly associated with the occurrence of RI in patients with flank pain."
https://openalex.org/W4225820077,"We recently identified a nuclear-encoded miRNA (miR-181c) in cardiomyocytes that can translocate into mitochondria to regulate mitochondrial gene mt-COX1 and influence obesity-induced cardiac dysfunction through the mitochondrial pathway. Because liver plays a pivotal role during obesity, we hypothesized that miR-181c might contribute to the pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. Therefore, we used miR-181c/d -/- mice to study the role of miR-181c in hepatocyte lipogenesis during diet-induced obesity. The mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, during which indirect calorimetric measurements were made. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. We found that miR-181c/d -/- mice were not protected against all metabolic consequences of HF exposure. After 26 weeks, the miR-181c/d -/- mice had a significantly higher body fat percentage than did wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d -/- mice. miR-181c/d -/- mice fed the HF diet had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels than did WT mice fed the same diet. qPCR data showed that several genes regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were more upregulated in miR-181c/d -/- liver than in WT liver. Furthermore, miR-181c delivered in vivo via adeno-associated virus attenuated the lipogenesis by downregulating these same lipid synthesis genes in the liver. In hepatocytes, miR-181c regulates lipid biosynthesis by targeting IDH1. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of miR-181c can be beneficial for various lipid metabolism disorders."

Adequate and regular perinatal care is essential through the continuum of pregnancy to mitigate pregnancy and birth complications. The aim of this study is to determine the association between IPV and male alcohol use and the receipt of perinatal care in Nepal. This study used pooled data from 2011 and 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). A total of 3067 women who interviewed for domestic violence module and had most recent live birth 5 years prior surveys were included in the analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between IPV and male alcohol use and the receipt of perinatal care. Of the total women interviewed, 22% reported physical violence, 14% emotional violence, and 11% sexual violence. Women who were exposed to physical violence were significantly more likely to report non-usage of institutional delivery [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 1.30 (95% Cl: 1.01, 1.68)] and skilled delivery assistants [aOR = 1.43 (95% Cl: 1.10, 1.88)]. Non-attendance of 4 or more skilled antenatal care visits was associated with a combination of alcohol use by male partner and exposure to emotional [aOR = 1.42 (95% Cl: 1.01, 2.00)] and physical violence [aOR = 1.39 (95% Cl: 1.03, 1.88)]. The negative association between IPV and perinatal care suggests it is essential to develop comprehensive community-based interventions which integrates IPV support services with other health services to increase the uptake of perinatal care through the continuum of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4200084039,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a critical role in the planning and monitoring of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) treated with locoregional therapies, in order to assess disease progression or recurrence. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI sequences offer temporal data on tumor enhancement characteristics which has strong prognostic value. Yet, predicting follow-up DCE-MR images from which tumor enhancement and viability can be measured, before treatment of HCC actually begins, remains an unsolved problem given the complexity of spatial and temporal information. We propose an approach to predict future DCE-MRI examinations following transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) by learning the spatio-temporal features related to HCC response from pre-TACE images. A novel Spatial-Temporal Discriminant Graph Neural Network (STDGNN) based on graph convolutional networks is presented. First, embeddings of viable, equivocal and non-viable HCCs are separated within a joint low-dimensional latent space, which is created using a discriminant neural network representing tumor-specific features. Spatial tumoral features from independent MRI volumes are then extracted with a structural branch, while dynamic features are extracted from the multi-phase sequence with a separate temporal branch. The model extracts spatio-temporal features by a joint minimization of the network branches. At testing, a pre-TACE diagnostic DCE-MRI is embedded on the discriminant spatio-temporal latent space, which is then translated to the follow-up domain space, thus allowing to predict the post-TACE DCE-MRI describing HCC treatment response. A dataset of 366 HCC's from liver cancer patients was used to train and test the model using DCE-MRI examinations with associated pathological outcomes, with the spatio-temporal framework yielding 93.5% classification accuracy in response identification, and generating follow-up images yielding insignificant differences in perfusion parameters compared to ground-truth post-TACE examinations."
https://openalex.org/W4200113600,"Chemotherapy drugs have limited efficacy in breast cancer due to multidrug resistance generated by cancer cells against anticancer drugs. In this study, we developed a novel derivative, 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene (TG1) by modifying 2, 3, 5, 4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (THSG). In-vivo zebrafish embryo tests revealed that TG1 showed low toxicity. The equitoxic combination of DOX or DTX with TG1 in MCF-7/Adr reduced the IC50 of DOX or DTX, and the combination index (CI) showed strong synergistic effects in the 1:3 molar ratio of DTX: TG1 and 1:5 molar ratio of DOX: TG1. Moreover, fluorescence images confirmed the cellular uptake of DOX when combined with TG1 in MCF-7/Adr. Western blotting analysis indicated downregulation of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) after MCF-7/Adr treated with TG1. In conclusion, the combined therapy of DTX or DOX and TG1 increases drug efficacy via suppressing the p-glycoprotein efflux pump. These results suggest that TG1 may have potential use for breast cancer patients, especially those with multidrug resistance."

We therefore conducted a retrospective observational study to detect SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal samples collected from hospitalized patients with a Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) enrolled in the DRIVE (Development of Robust and Innovative Vaccine Effectiveness) study in five Italian hospitals (CIRI-IT BIVE hospitals network) (1st November 2019 - 29th February 2020).To acquire new information on the real trend in SARS-CoV-2 infection during pandemic phase I and to determine the possible early appearance of the virus in Italy.Samples were tested for influenza [RT-PCR assay (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yam, B/Vic)] in accordance with the DRIVE study protocol. Subsequently, swabs underwent molecular testing for SARS-COV-2. [one-step real-time multiplex retro-transcription (RT) PCR].In the 1683 samples collected, no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was found. Moreover, 28.3% (477/1683) of swabs were positive for influenza viruses, the majority being type A (358 vs 119 type B). A/H3N2 was predominant among influenza A viruses (55%); among influenza B viruses, B/Victoria was prevalent. The highest influenza incidence rate was reported in patients aged 0-17 years (40.3%) followed by those aged 18-64 years (24.4%) and ≥65 years (14.8%).In Italy, some studies have shown the early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in northern regions, those most severely affected during phase I of the pandemic. In central and southern regions, by contrast no early circulation of the virus was registered. These results are in line with ours. These findings highlight the need to continue to carry out retrospective studies, in order to understand the epidemiology of the novel coronavirus, to better identify the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with other acute respiratory illnesses (ARI), and to evaluate the real burden of COVID-19 on the healthcare system."

Cisgender-female, cisgender-male, and transmale participants, who were assigned female sex but did not have a female gender identity, were compared in terms of effects that have been observed in cisgender individuals: task-domain effects, in which males perform better than females on spatial tasks and females perform better than males on verbal tasks; and hemisphere-asymmetry effects, in which males show larger differences between the left and right hemispheres than females. In addition, the present research measured participants' intelligence in order to control for potential moderating effects. Participants performed spatial (mental rotation) and verbal (lexical decision) tasks presented to each hemisphere using a divided-visual field paradigm, and then completed an intelligence assessment. In the mental-rotation task, cismale and transmale participants performed better than cisfemale participants, however this group difference was explained by intelligence scores, with higher scores predicting better performance. In the lexical-decision task, cismale and transmale participants exhibited a greater left-hemisphere advantage than cisfemales, and this difference was not affected by intelligence scores. Taken together, results do not support task-domain effects when intelligence is accounted for; however, they do demonstrate a hemisphere-asymmetry effect in the verbal domain that is moderated by gender identity and not assigned sex."

Measurements of donated human milk were performed before fortification as well as at 1 hour, 24 hours, and 48 hours after fortification with CMBF or HMBF. MFG size in each sample of fortified milk was measured by laser light scattering. MFG size in the fortified milks increased gradually over time. At 24 and 48 hours after fortification, MFG size in the milk with CMBF was larger than that in the milk with HMBF (4.8 ± 0.5 vs 4.3 ± 0.3 μm, p<0.01, 5.1 ± 0.7 vs 4.5 ± 0.4 μm, p = 0.03, respectively). HMBF is associated with less alteration of MFG size than CMBF. This may have an impact on feeding tolerance of very preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W4200195696,"Introduction The burden of IgE-mediated food allergy in Australian born children is reported to be among the highest globally. This illness shares risk factors and frequently coexists with asthma, one of the most common noncommunicable diseases of childhood. Findings from a case-control study suggest that compared to immunisation with acellular pertussis vaccine, early priming of infants with whole-cell pertussis vaccine may be associated with a lower risk of subsequent IgE-mediated food allergy. If whole-cell vaccination is protective of food allergy and other atopic diseases, especially if protective against childhood asthma, the population-level effects could justify its preferential recommendation. However, the potential beneficial effects of whole-cell pertussis vaccination for the prevention of atopic diseases at a population-scale are yet to be investigated. Methods and analysis Analyses of population-based record linkage data will be undertaken to compare the rates of admissions to hospital for asthma in children aged between 5 and 15 years old, who were born in Western Australia (WA) or New South Wales (NSW) between 1997 and 1999 (329,831) when pertussis immunisation in Australia transitioned from whole-cell to acellular only schedules. In the primary analysis we will estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the time-to-first-event (hospital admissions as above) using Cox proportional hazard models in recipients of a first dose of whole-cell versus acellular pertussis-containing vaccine before 112 days old (~4 months of age). Similarly, we will also fit time-to-recurrent events analyses using Andersen-Gill models, and robust variance estimates to account for potential within-child dependence. Hospitalisations for all-cause anaphylaxis, food anaphylaxis, venom, all-cause urticaria and atopic dermatitis will also be examined in children who received at least one dose of pertussis-containing vaccine by the time of the cohort entry, using analogous statistical methods. Presentations to the emergency departments will be assessed separately using the same statistical approach."
https://openalex.org/W4200351092,"Genetic molecular studies used to understand potential risks of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are incomplete. Intracellular residual ENMs present in biological samples may cause assay interference. This report applies the high-resolution melt (HRM) feature of RT-qPCR to detect shifts caused by the presence of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). A universal RNA standard (untreated control) sample was spiked with known amounts of AuNPs and reverse transcribed, where 10 reference genes were amplified. The amplification plots, dissociation assay (melt) profiles, electrophoretic profiles and HRM difference curves were analysed and detected interference caused by AuNPs, which differed according to the amount of AuNP present (i.e. semi-quantitative). Whether or not the assay interference was specific to the reverse transcription or the PCR amplification step was tested. The study was extended to a target gene-of-interest (GOI), Caspase 7. Also, the effect on in vitro cellular samples was assessed (for reference genes and Caspase 7). This method can screen for the presence of AuNPs in RNA samples, which were isolated from biological material in contact with the nanomaterials, i.e., during exposure and risk assessment studies. This is an important quality control procedure to be implemented when quantifying the expression of a GOI from samples that have been in contact with various ENMs. It is recommended to further examine 18S, PPIA and TBP since these were the most reliable for detecting shifts in the difference curves, irrespective of the source of the RNA, or, the point at which the different AuNPs interacted with the assay."
https://openalex.org/W4200450636,"Musicians tend to have better auditory and motor performance than non-musicians because of their extensive musical experience. In a previous study, we established that loudness discrimination acuity is enhanced when sound is produced by a precise force generation task. In this study, we compared the enhancement effect between experienced pianists and non-musicians. Without the force generation task, loudness discrimination acuity was better in pianists than non-musicians in the condition. However, the force generation task enhanced loudness discrimination acuity similarly in both pianists and non-musicians. The reaction time was also reduced with the force control task, but only in the non-musician group. The results suggest that the enhancement of loudness discrimination acuity with the precise force generation task is independent of musical experience and is, therefore, a fundamental function in auditory-motor interaction."
