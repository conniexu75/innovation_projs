https://openalex.org/W2030627388,"The method for approximately dating white lead, which is based upon the decay of lead-210 present in recently refined lead, has been modified to circumvent potential interferences. The modified method has been applied to additional samples of known age and finds increased utility through special treatment of the obtained data. The method was also successfuilly applied to a number of interesting problems of authentication."

https://openalex.org/W2046340667,The pulsating radio star reported by Hewish et al. (1) has been studied in the blue region of the optical spectrum and found to have a pulse amplitude less than 10 percent of the photon count expected for 18th magnitude. No upper limit to a sinusoidal oscillation less than or equal to a complete modulation can be set.
