https://openalex.org/W2897689082,"Two winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) populations, i.e. 180 genetic resources and 210 elite varieties, were compared in a field trial to analyse how grain number and grain yield distribution along the spike changed during the breeding process and how this associates to yield-related traits. Elites showed in average 38% more yield compared to resources. This breeding improvement mainly derived from an increase in grains and yield per spike in addition to grains and yield per spikelet. These increments corresponded to 19, 23, 21 and 25%, respectively. Not much gain in thousand grain weight (4%) was observed in elites as compared to resources. The number of spikelets per spike was not, or even negatively, correlated with most traits, except of grains per spike, which suggests that this trait was not favoured during breeding. The grain number and grain yield distributions along the spike (GDAS and GYDAS) were measured and compared by using a novel mathematical tool. GDAS and GYDAS measure the deviation of a spike of interest from the architecture of a model spike with even grain and yield distribution along all spikelets, respectively. Both traits were positively correlated. Elites showed in average only a 1% improvement in GDAS and GYDAS values compared to resources. This comparison revealed that breeding increased grain number and yield uniformly along the spike without changing relative yield input of individual spikelets, thereby, maintaining the general spike architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2897074679,"Huanglongbing (HLB, also known as citrus greening) is considered to be the most devastating disease that has significantly damaged the citrus industry globally. HLB is caused by the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the fastidious phloem-restricted gram-negative bacterium, vectored by the asian citrus psyllid. To date, there is no effective control available against CLas. To alleviate the effects of HLB on the industry and protect citrus farmers, there is an urgent need to identify or develop inhibitor molecules to suppress or eradicate CLas from infected citrus plant. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time an in planta efficacy of two antimicrobial compounds against CLas viz. 2S albumin (a plant based protein; ~12.5 kDa), Nano-Zinc Oxide (Nano-ZnO; ~ 4.0 nm diameter) and their combinations. Aqueous formulations of these compounds were trunk-injected to HLB affected Mosambi plants (Citrus sinensis) grafted on 3-year old rough lemon (C. jambhiri) rootstock with known CLas titer maintained inside an insect-free screen house. The effective concentration of 2S albumin (330 ppm) coupled with the Nano-ZnO (330 ppm) at 1:1 ratio was used. The dynamics of CLas pathogen load of treated Mosambi plants was assessed using TaqMan-qPCR assay every 30 days after treatment (DAT) and monitored till 120 days. We observed that 2S albumin-Nano-ZnO formulation performed the best among all the treatments decreasing CLas population by 96.2%, 97.6%, 95.6%, and 97% of the initial bacterial load (per 12.5 ng of genomic DNA) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 DAT, respectively. Our studies demonstrated the potency of 2S albumin-Nano-ZnO formulation as an antimicrobial treatment for suppressing CLas in planta and could potentially be developed as a novel anti CLas therapeutics to mitigate the HLB severity affecting the citrus industry worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W2896681008,"Hippo signaling pathway is considered a key regulator of tissue homeostasis, cell proliferation, apoptosis and it is involved in cancer development. In skeletal muscle, YAP, a downstream target of the Hippo pathway, is an important player in myoblast proliferation, atrophy/hypertrophy regulation, and in mechano-trasduction, transferring mechanical signals into transcriptional responses. We studied components of Hippo pathway in muscle specimens from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A and type 2B and healthy subjects. Only DMD muscles had decreased YAP1 protein expression, increased LATS1/2 kinase activity, low Survivin mRNA expression and high miR-21 expression. In light of our novel results, a schematic model is postulated: low levels of YOD1 caused by increased inhibition by miR-21 lead to an increase of LATS1/2 activity which in turn augments phosphorylation of YAP. Reduced amount of active YAP, which is also a target of increased miR-21, causes decreased nuclear expression of YAP-mediated target genes. Since it is known that YAP has beneficial roles in promoting tissue repair and regeneration after injury so that its activation may be therapeutically useful, our results suggest that some components of Hippo pathway could become novel therapeutic targets for DMD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2897345449,"In the past few decades, a diverse array of research has emphasized the precocity of technically advanced and symbolic practices occurring during the southern African Middle Stone Age. However, uncertainties regarding the regional chrono-cultural framework constrain models and identification of the cultural and ecological mechanisms triggering the development of such early innovative behaviours. Here, we present new results and a refined chronology for the Pietersburg, a techno-complex initially defined in the late 1920's, which has disappeared from the literature since the 1980's. We base our revision of this techno-complex on ongoing excavations at Bushman Rock Shelter (BRS) in Limpopo Province, South Africa, where two Pietersburg phases (an upper phase called '21' and a lower phase called '28') are recognized. Our analysis focuses on the '28' phase, characterized by a knapping strategy based on Levallois and semi-prismatic laminar reduction systems and typified by the presence of end-scrapers. Luminescence chronology provides two sets of ages for the upper and lower Pietersburg of BRS, dated respectively to 73±6ka and 75±6ka on quartz and to 91±10ka and 97±10ka on feldspar, firmly positioning this industry within MIS5. Comparisons with other published lithic assemblages show technological differences between the Pietersburg from BRS and other southern African MIS5 traditions, especially those from the Western and Eastern Cape. We argue that, at least for part of MIS5, human populations in South Africa were regionally differentiated, a process that most likely impacted the way groups were territorially and socially organized. Nonetheless, comparisons between MIS5 assemblages also indicate some typological similarities, suggesting some degree of connection between human groups, which shared similar innovations but manipulated them in different ways. We pay particular attention to the end-scrapers from BRS, which represent thus far the earliest documented wide adoption of such tool-type and provide further evidence for the innovative processes characterizing southern Africa from the MIS5 onwards."
https://openalex.org/W2895874015,"An increasing number of young girls have attached great importance to their body-image in China. Body-image dissatisfaction has resulted in increased weight loss behavior. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that were associated with underweight body-image in female college students. Self-administered questionnaires were completed by 2,023 young female participants from eight Chinese universities. In addition, 160 participants were involved in a qualitative study. The ideal body-image and the factors that influence weight were determined using descriptive and analytical statistics. We found that 1,484 out of 2,023 participants (73.36%) had taken action to lose weight in the past six months. Among these participants, 618 (30.55%, out of 2023) participants were already underweight, and 1,161 (57.39%, out of 2023) would like to be much thinner, which would lead to more underweight individuals. Moreover, non-scientific physical activity and diets were found to lead participants to the underweight subgroup. The participants' Body Mass Index (BMI), peer advice and western culture influenced the problematic thin-ideal (ideal BMI < 18.5 was considered as the problematic thin-ideal) (P<0.05). Together, western influences leading to the ""problematic thin-ideal"" and ""unhealthy weight-control behavior"" have brought about an increased prevalence of desired underweight body-image among female college students in China, which might be harmful for their health."
https://openalex.org/W2897614356,"Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis, from the Kayenta Formation of Arizona, is one of only three sauropodomorph dinosaurs known from the Early Jurassic of North America. It joins Anchisaurus polyzelus, from the older Portland Formation of the Hartford Basin, and Seitaad reussi, from the younger Navajo Sandstone of Utah, in representing the oldest North American sauropodomorphs. If it is true that sauropodomorphs were absent from North America during the Late Triassic, the relationship among these three dinosaurs offers a test of the mechanisms that drove recovery in North American biodiversity following the end-Triassic extinction event. Here we provide the first thorough description of Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis based on completed preparation and computed tomographic imaging of the holotype and referred specimens. With new anatomical data, our phylogenetic analysis supports the conclusion that Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis is nested within the primarily Gondwanan clade Massospondylidae, while agreeing with previous analyses that the three North American sauropodomorphs do not themselves form an exclusive clade. A revised diagnosis and more thorough understanding of the anatomy of Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis support the view that independent dispersal events were at least partly responsible for the recovery in North American vertebrate diversity following a major extinction event."
https://openalex.org/W2895911577,"Understanding large carnivore occurrence patterns in anthropogenic landscapes adjacent to protected areas is central to developing actions for species conservation in an increasingly human-dominated world. Among large carnivores, leopards (Panthera pardus) are the most widely distributed felid. Leopards occupying anthropogenic landscapes frequently come into conflict with humans, which often results in leopard mortality. Leopards' use of anthropogenic landscapes, and their frequent involvement with conflict, make them an insightful species for understanding the determinants of carnivore occurrence across human-dominated habitats. We evaluated the spatial variation in leopard site use across a multiple-use landscape in Tanzania's Ruaha landscape. Our study region encompassed i) Ruaha National Park, where human activities were restricted and sport hunting was prohibited; ii) the Pawaga-Idodi Wildlife Management Area, where wildlife sport hunting, wildlife poaching, and illegal pastoralism all occurred at relatively low levels; and iii) surrounding village lands where carnivores and other wildlife were frequently exposed to human-carnivore conflict related-killings and agricultural habitat conversion and development. We investigated leopard occurrence across the study region via an extensive camera trapping network. We estimated site use as a function of environmental (i.e. habitat and anthropogenic) variables using occupancy models within a Bayesian framework. We observed a steady decline in leopard site use with downgrading protected area status from the national park to the Wildlife Management Area and village lands. Our findings suggest that human-related activities such as increased livestock presence and proximity to human households exerted stronger influence than prey availability on leopard site use, and were the major limiting factors of leopard distribution across the gradient of human pressure, especially in the village lands outside Ruaha National Park. Overall, our study provides valuable information about the determinants of spatial distribution of leopards in human-dominated landscapes that can help inform conservation strategies in the borderlands adjacent to protected areas."
https://openalex.org/W2898019549,"Objective To study the prognostic value of baseline leukocytosis or neutrophiliain two retrospective cohorts of stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and methods Clinical records of consecutive previously untreated NSCLC patients in our Institution between June 2001 and September 2016 for stage III NSCLC were collected. The prognostic value of pretreatment leucocyte disorders was examined, with focus on patterns of relapse and survival. Leukocytosis and neutrophilia were defined as a leukocyte count or a neutrophil count exceeding 10 and 7 G/L, respectively. Results We identified 238 patients, displaying baseline leukocytosis or neutrophilia in 39% and 40% respectively. Most were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (48%), and stage IIIB NSCLC (58%). 3-year actuarial overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 35% and 27% respectively. Local relapses were reported in 100 patients (42%), and distant metastases in 132 patients (55%). In multivariate analysis, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and induction chemotherapy regimen based on carboplatin/paclitaxel were associated with worse OS and PFS (p<0.05). Neutrophilia independently decreased Locoregional Control (LRC) (HR = 2.5, p<0.001) and Distant Metastasis Control (DMC) (HR = 2.1, p<0.001). Neutrophilia was significantly associated with worse brain metastasis control (p = 0.004), mostly in adenocarcinoma patients (p<0.001). Conclusion In stage III NSCLC patients, treated with concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation, baseline leukocytosis and neutrophilia were associated with worse OS, PFS, LRC, and DMC. In addition with previously available markers, this independent cost-effective biomarker could help to stratify stage III NSCLC population with more accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W2896574520,"The increasing use of terrestrial plant lipids to replace of fish oil in commercial aquafeeds requires understanding synthesis and storage of long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) in farmed fish. Manipulation of dietary fatty acids may maximize tissue storage of LC-PUFA, through increased production and selective utilization. A data synthesis study was conducted to estimate optimal levels of fatty acids that may maximize the production and storage of LC-PUFA in the edible portion of salmonids. Data were compiled from four studies with Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, and steelhead trout (total n = 180) which were fed diets containing different terrestrial-based oils to replace fish oil. LC-PUFA (%) were linearly correlated between diet and muscle tissue (p < 0.001; r2 > 44%), indicating proportional storage after consumption. The slope, or retention rate, was highest for docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at 1.23, indicating that an additional 23% of DHA was stored in the muscle. Dietary saturated fatty acids were positively related to DHA stored in the muscle (p < 0.001; r2 = 22%), which may involve membrane structural requirements, as well as selective catabolism. DHA was found to be optimally stored with a dietary n-3: n-6 ratio of 1.03: 1. These new results provide a baseline of optimal dietary ratios that can be tested experimentally to determine the efficacy of balancing dietary fatty acids for maximum LC-PUFA storage."
https://openalex.org/W2897279342,"Low skeletal muscle mass is frequently observed in cancer patients and is known to be a poor prognostic factor for survival outcomes. The purposes of our study were to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and its relation to mortality in biliary tract cancer. Body composition measurements (skeletal muscle index, total fat mass, bone mineral content) were evaluated by using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in 75 biliary tract cancer patients before chemotherapy. Muscle strength was measured by handgrip strength and gait speed. Overall survival and its associated factors were determined. The mean appendicular muscle mass was 17.8±2.7 kg in men and 14.0±2.1 kg in women (p < 0.05). Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 46 patients (61.3%) and higher proportion of men was classified as sarcopenia than women (69.0% vs 35.3%, p < 0.05). Multivariable analysis adjusted for chemotherapy regimen and age revealed that high appendicular muscle mass independently predicted better survival outcomes (HR 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.88; p = 0.023). Sarcopenia is common in biliary tract cancer patients and low appendicular muscle mass was associated with poor survival outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2897345327,"Introduction Intestinal parasitic infections are a major public health problem in inter-tropical areas. The aim of our study was to describe the situation in Mahajanga, Madagascar with a particular focus on two protozoa, Dientamoeba fragilis and Blastocystis sp. Methods This was a prospective study from February to June 2015. Stool samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients and asymptomatic volunteers were submitted to microscopy and molecular assays in order to detect parasites. Results A wide panel of intestinal parasites were identified among the 265 included subjects, protozoa being the most prevalent with 72.8% whereas the prevalence of helminths and microsporidia was of 7.9% and 4.5%, respectively. Blastocystis sp. was the most prevalent protozoa (64.5% of the entire cohort) followed by various amoebas (35.5%) and flagellates (27,5%). We only detected subtypes 1, 2 and 3 of Blastocystis sp. Among the patients positive for D. fragilis (9.4%), 23 carried genotype 1 and 1 genotype 2. For the first time, we detected in 4 human stools the DNA of a recently described protozoon, Simplicimonas similis. Interestingly, subjects living in urban areas harbored significantly more different parasitic species than subjects living in rural areas with a correlation between sanitary level of neighborhood and protozoan infection. However, there was no difference in prevalence of digestive symptoms between parasite-free and parasite-infected subjects, except for Giardia intestinalis which had more symptomatic carriers. Discussion Our study reveals a high overall parasite prevalence, similar to what had been found in 2003 in the same city and to other prevalence studies conducted in Africa. The poor access of the population to sanitary infrastructures may explain this result. Data from our study provide valuable key for sanitation programs and prevention of fecal-related infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2896688242,"Oil bodies are the unique feature of most liverworts. Their shape, color and distribution pattern in leaf and underleaf cells are important taxonomic features of the genus Calypogeia. Most species of the genus Calypogeia have pellucid and colorless oil bodies, whereas colored, including gray to pale brown, purple-brown or blue oil bodies, are rare. To date, C. azurea was the only species with blue oil bodies to have been considered as a species of the Holarctic range. This species has been noted in various parts of the northern hemisphere–from North America, through Europe to the Far East. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of C. azurea from different parts of its distribution range and to ascertain whether blue oil bodies appeared once or several times in the evolution of the genus Calypogeia. The phylogenetic analyses based on four plastid regions (rbcL, trnG, trnL, trnH-psbA) and one nuclear region (ITS2) revealed that C. azurea is presently a paraphyletic taxon, with other Calypogeia species nested among C. azurea accessions that were clustered into four different clades. Based on the level of genetic divergence (1.03–2.17%) and the observed morphological, ecological and geographical differences, the evaluated clades could be regarded as previously unrecognized species. Four species were identified: C. azurea Stotler & Crotz (a European species corresponding to the holotype), two new species from Pacific Asia—C. orientalis Buczkowska & Bakalin and C. sinensis Bakalin & Buczkowska, and a North American species which, due to the lack of identifiable morphological features, must be regarded as the cryptic species of C. azurea with a provisional name of C. azurea species NA."
https://openalex.org/W2897862634,"Aerobic exercise improves cognitive function and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. However, the effects of aerobic exercise combined with strength exercise on cognitive function and adult hippocampal neurogenesis are still unknown. In this study, we established exercise paradigms in rats to mimic aerobic exercise combined with low- and high-intensity strength exercise. We found that aerobic exercise improved spatial learning and memory as well as adult hippocampal neurogenesis, whereas strength exercise suppressed aerobic exercise-induced cognitive improvements and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an intensity-dependent manner. Furthermore, the levels of β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) and its downstream effector brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were increased in the aerobic exercise group, and strength exercise impaired the aerobic exercise-induced increases in β-HB and BDNF mRNA levels. Taken together, these results demonstrated that strength exercise weakened aerobic exercise-induced cognitive improvements and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2897072723,"Onapristone is a type I progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist, which prevents PR- mediated DNA transcription. Onapristone is active in multiple preclinical models and two prior studies demonstrated promising activity in patients with breast cancer. We conducted a study of extended release (ER) Onapristone to determine a recommended dose and explore the role of transcriptionally-activated PR (APR), detected as an aggregated subnuclear distribution pattern, as a predictive biomarker.An open-label, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, phase 1 study (target n = 60; NCT02052128) included female patients ≥18 years with PRpos tumors. APR analysis was performed on archival tumor tissue. Patients were randomized to five cohorts of extended release (ER) onapristone tablets 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 mg BID, or immediate release 100 mg QD until progressive disease or intolerability. Primary endpoint was to identify the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary endpoints included safety, clinical benefit and pharmacokinetics.The phase 1 dose escalation component of the study is complete (n = 52). Tumor diagnosis included: endometrial carcinoma 12; breast cancer 20; ovarian cancer 13; other 7. Median age was 64 (36-84). No dose limiting toxicity was observed with reported liver function test elevation related only to liver metastases. The RP2D was 50 mg ER BID. Median therapy duration was 8 weeks (range 2-44), and 9 patients had clinical benefit ≥24 weeks, including 2 patients with APRpos endometrial carcinoma.Clinical benefit with excellent tolerance was seen in heavily pretreated patients with endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer. The data support the development of Onapristone in endometrial endometrioid cancer. Onapristone should also be evaluated in ovarian and breast cancers along with APR immunohistochemistry validation."
https://openalex.org/W2897084197,"Helium, a minor component of natural gas and radioactive minerals, is most commonly used as a carrier in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Its scarcity leads to limited availability and higher costs. In this experiment, hydrogen from a safe source of a hydrogen generator was tested as a substitutive carrier gas for the detection of adulterant in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and food supplements by GC-MS analysis. We found that the limits of detection (LODs) of using hydrogen were from 10 to 1000 μg/g. The levels of LODs tested among 170 drugs remain the same whether hydrogen or helium was used as a carrier gas with the exception of 7 drugs-benzbromarone, estradiol benzoate, bezafibrate, mefenamic acid, oxymetholone, piperidenafil and cetilistat. The real sample analysis results using hydrogen were as satisfactory as those using helium. In addition, the retention time was shortened after the chromatographic performance was optimized. In summary, it is worth considering hydrogen as a carrier gas due to its affordable costs, energy efficiency, carbon reduction and chromatographic advantages to detect adulterated drugs in TCM and dietary supplement using GC-MS."
https://openalex.org/W2896597937,"Based on carbon spot prices selected from seven carbon pilots, we assess the financial performances related to carbon volatility in China on the overall perspective. According to the results, the Chinese carbon market fluctuated severely at the beginning of carbon trading, but has stabilised in general, despite several dramatic changes related to 'yearly compliance events'. Long-term memory exists in the volatility series. Moreover, asymmetry exists in the Chinese carbon market, and volatility reacts more severely to good news than to bad news. Finally, we discuss our empirical results, and make certain suggestions regarding firms' awareness, international cooperation and individual investors not only for policy makers in China but also for other developing countries who are contemplating either commencing carbon trading or improving the current market."
https://openalex.org/W2897256944,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a severe genetic disorder that manifests in progressive neuromuscular degeneration. SMA originates from loss-of-function mutations of the SMN1 (Survival of Motor Neuron 1) gene. Recent evidence has implicated peripheral deficits, especially in skeletal muscle, as key contributors to disease progression in SMA. In this study we generated myogenic cells from two SMA-affected human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines with deletion of SMN1 bearing two copies of the SMN2 gene and recapitulating the molecular phenotype of Type 1 SMA. We characterized myoblasts and myotubes by comparing them to two unaffected, control hESC lines and demonstrate that SMA myoblasts and myotubes showed altered expression of various myogenic markers, which translated into an impaired in vitro myogenic maturation and development process. Additionally, we provide evidence that these SMN1 deficient cells display functional deficits in cholinergic calcium signaling response, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Our data describe a novel human myogenic SMA model that might be used for interrogating the effect of SMN depletion during skeletal muscle development, and as model to investigate biological mechanisms targeting myogenic differentiation, mitochondrial respiration and calcium signaling processes in SMA muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2897581545,"Fibroblasts are a major component of cancer tissue and known to contribute to cancer progression. However, it remains unknown whether they are derived from local fibroblasts or of other origin. This study was designed to identify the contribution of local stromal cells to cancer stroma in human epithelial ovarian cancer. Seventy-six cases of surgically resected primary ovarian carcinoma (48 cases confined to the ovaries and 28 cases with distant metastases) and 17 cases of secondary ovarian tumor (e.g. colon cancer metastasized to the ovary) were enrolled in this study. The tissues were immunostained for forkhead box protein L2 (FOXL2), a transcription factor crucial for ovarian development and function, and markers for cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and inflammatory cells. Under normal condition, FOXL2 expression was restricted to ovarian stromal cells and some other types of cells in female genital tracts and never found in other sites of the body. FOXL2-positive cells were found in all primary and secondary tumors in the ovary, and were the dominant stromal cells in most cases. In contrast, only a few FOXL2-positive cells were found in peritoneal seeding sites of four serous carcinoma cases, and all the other tumors at extraovarian sites had no FOXL2-positive cells. FOXL2-positive cells in the ovarian lesion variably expressed CAFs markers, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin and fibroblast activating protein, as determined by double immunostaining. Background inflammation, but not histological subtype or origin of the neoplasm seemed to correlate with the proportion of FOXL2-positive cells. These results suggest that ovarian stromal cells are the main source of cancer stroma in the ovary but do not seem to move to distant sites via circulation together with tumor cells. Our results also support the hypothesis that cancer-associated fibroblasts may originate locally, which was previously demonstrated using animal models."
https://openalex.org/W2896912123,"Navigation plays an essential role for many animals leading a mobile mode of life, and for central place foragers in particular. One important prerequisite for navigation is the ability to estimate distances covered during locomotion. It has been shown that Cataglyphis desert ants, well-established model organisms in insect navigation, use two odometer mechanisms, namely, stride and optic flow integration. Although both mechanisms are well established, their mode of interaction to build one odometer output remains enigmatic. We tackle this problem by selectively covering the ventral eye parts in Cataglyphis fortis foragers, the eye regions responsible for optic flow input in odometry. Exclusion of optic flow cues was implemented during different sections of outbound and inbound travel. This demonstrated that the two odometers have separate distance memories that interact in determining homing distance. Possible interpretations posit that the two odometer memories (i) take on different relative weights according to context or (ii) compete in a winner-take-all mode. Explanatory values and implications of such interpretations are discussed. We are able to provide a rough quantitative assessment of odometer cue interaction. An understanding of the interaction of different odometer mechanisms appears valuable not only for animal navigation research but may inform discussions on sensor fusion in both behavioural contexts and potential technical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2897268244,"Development and maturation of submandibular salivary glands are influenced by intrauterine diabetic environment. Several studies investigated the effects of diabetes on the salivary glands. However, the effects of maternal diabetes on the submandibular glands of the offspring was not properly examined. Therefore, the present study was designed to describe the changes in the development of the submandibular glands of the offspring of diabetic mothers. The submandibular glands of the offspring of Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic female rats were examined at two and four weeks after birth. Detection of mRNA demonstrated that maternal diabetes affects the level of different indicators. The reduction of expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF); a protein mitogen, cytokeratin 5 (CK5); an epithelial cell progenitor, CK7 and aquaporin 5 (AQP5); differentiation markers and B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2); an antiapoptotic marker were found. Increase in Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax); an apoptotic marker was detected. These changes indicate their effects on saliva secretion, glands tumorigenesis, growth of normal oral flora and oral microbes, with decreased protein synthesis and production of xerostomia and dental caries. Loss of normal glandular architecture, significant increase in fibrosis, by the detection of collagen fibers, and stagnation of secretory granules were found with atrophic changes in the acinar cells. Marked defect of polysaccharides in the acinar cells, denoting functional changes, was manifested by significant reduction of the intensity of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. The positive immunoreactivity of caspase-3, denoting cellular apoptosis, and minimal reaction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α SMA) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evident in the offspring of diabetic mothers. We conclude that maternal diabetes produces degenerative effects in the structure and function of the submandibular salivary glands of the offspring, reflecting possible influences on their secretory activity affecting oral and digestive health."
https://openalex.org/W2896158907,"It is currently not well understood whether people experience themselves to be located in one or more specific part(s) of their body. Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as a tool to study aspects of bodily perception and self-consciousness, due to its strong experimental control and ease in manipulating multi-sensory aspects of bodily experience. To investigate where people self-locate in their body within virtual reality, we asked participants to point directly at themselves with a virtual pointer, in a VR headset. In previous work employing a physical pointer, participants mainly located themselves in the upper face and upper torso. In this study, using a VR headset, participants mainly located themselves in the upper face. In an additional body template task where participants pointed at themselves on a picture of a simple body outline, participants pointed most often to the upper torso, followed by the (upper) face. These results raise the question as to whether head-mounted virtual reality might alter where people locate themselves making them more “head-centred”."
https://openalex.org/W2897763144,"Twelve experimental diets with three levels of energy densities (11.25, 12.38 and 13.50 MJ/kg) and fours levels of starch to lipid ratios (14:1, 12:1, 7:1, 4:1) were offered to 288 male Ross 308 broiler chickens. All the diets were formulated to contain consistent digestible lysine to metabolisable energy ratios (0.87 g digestible lysine/MJ AMEn) and ideal amino acid ratios. Growth performance was monitored from 7 to 27 days post-hatch and parameters of nutrient utilisation (AME, AMEn, AME:GE ratios, N retention) were determined from 24 to 26 days post-hatch. Apparent protein (N) and starch digestibility coefficients, carcass yield and composition were determined at 27 days post-hatch. There were no interactions between energy densities and starch to lipid ratios on growth performance and carcass weights (P > 0.05). Feed intake was reduced with increased energy densities (P < 0.001). Weight gain and FCR were improved with increased dietary energy densities (P < 0.0001). Starch to lipid ratios linearly increased weight gain (r = 0.448, P = 0.001) and feed intake (r = 0.509, P < 0.001) without influencing FCR (P > 0.75). Both nutrient densities and starch to lipid ratios significantly impacted on carcass weight and yield. Heavier carcass weights and higher yields were observed in broiler chickens offered diets with high nutrient density (P ≤ 0.001). Carcass weight (r = 0.441, P < 0.005) was positively correlated with starch to lipid ratios and this tended to be the case for carcass yield (r = 0.277, P = 0.057) too. However, there were interactions on lipid concentrations in carcass (P < 0.001) as broiler chickens offered diet containing the lowest nutrient density and the highest starch to lipid ratio had the highest lipid carcass concentration of 12.94%. In conclusion, protein and energy need to be considered in tandem in practical diet formulation, especially in diets containing high crystalline amino acid inclusions. The impact of lipid on feed intake and starch on carcass lipid concentrations should also be taken into consideration."

Monitoring their presence in environmental samples is an important but complex task that has attracted the attention of many research groups.

This probe, designed on the base on the internal repeats of the human histidine rich glycoprotein, shows a turn on response to Zn2+ and a turn off response to Cu2+. Other heavy metals (Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+) do not interfere with the detection of Zn2+ and Cu2+. Here we report that dH3w has an affinity for Hg2+ considerably higher than that for Zn2+ or Cu2+, therefore the strong fluorescence of the Zn2+/dH3w complex is quenched when it is exposed to aqueous solutions of Hg2+, allowing the detection of sub-micromolar levels of Hg2+. Fluorescence of the Zn2+/dH3w complex is also quenched by Cu2+ whereas other heavy metals (Mn2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Sn2+ and Cr3+) have no effect. The high affinity and selectivity suggest that dH3w and the Zn2+/dH3w complex are suited as fluorescent sensor for the detection of Hg2+ and Cu2+ in environmental as well as biological samples."
https://openalex.org/W2897903789,"This study aimed to investigate prevalence and associated factors of influenza vaccination (IV) among children aged 12–23 months. Our cross-sectional survey interviewed 489 parents of children aged 12–23 months anonymously at twelve maternal and child health centers in Hong Kong. Results showed that only 11.5% of the children had ever received IV (64.3% being subsidized). Adjusted for the child’s age, significant factors of the children’s IV included parental knowledge about governmental policy/recommendation (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.64, 95%CI = 1.09,6.40), knowledge about annual IV requirement (AOR = 2.30, 95%CI = 1.21,4.38), perceived safety-related barrier (AOR≥0.14, 95%CI = 0.06,0.33), cue to action (AOR = 7.79, 95%CI = 3.45,17.58), and subjective norm (AOR = 4.59, 95%CI = 2.34,9.00). IV prevalence of children aged 12–23 months remained low despite a subsidization scheme. The higher IV prevalence of older children reported by other studies suggested that parents postponed action. Promotion campaigns should shift emphases from cost reduction and mass media approaches to dissemination of knowledge about IV policy and safety, enhancement of health professionals’ advice, and creation of supportive subjective norm."
https://openalex.org/W2897979723,"Endothelial cells have been considered the central regulators of cytokine storm in the respiratory system during influenza virus infection. Studies have found that elevated autophagy could be an essential component of viral pathogenesis in influenza infection. However, few studies have been performed to examine whether autophagy occurs in human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPMECs). In addition, specific mechanisms about how inflammatory responses are regulated in the endothelial cells remain unclear. We hypothesized that infection of influenza A viruses subtypes H1N1 and H9N2 triggered autophagy, which played an important role in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines, both in human lung epithelial A549 cells and in HPMECs. In this report, we showed our evidence that blockage of autophagy significantly inhibited influenza virus-induced proinflammatory responses and suppressed viral replication. Our data indicated that the inhibition of the cytokine response and viral replication was affected by increasing the expression of endothelial sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1), which might be through the regulation of NF-κB signaling. Overexpression of S1PR1 decreased p65 phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, we demonstrated that S1PR1 stimulation inhibited Akt-mTOR signaling, which might contribute to activation of autophagy in HPMECs. Thus, our study provides knowledge crucial to better understanding novel mechanisms underlying the S1PR1-mediated attenuation of cytokine amplification in the pulmonary system during influenza virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2895843172,"Emergence agitation (EA) is a frequent phenomenon in children recovering from general anaesthesia and increases the risk of self-injury. Previously, our group reported that stimulating the heart 7 (HT7) acupuncture point bilaterally using two neuromuscular transmission monitoring devices (NTMs) decreased the incidence of EA. However, bilateral stimulation is a barrier to clinical use because two NTMs are needed for one patient.The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of unilateral electrical stimulation of HT7 using an NTM to prevent EA in children.Prospective, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial.Kanagawa Children's Medical Centre, Yokohama, Japan.One hundred children (ages 18-96 months) with ASA-PS I or II, who were scheduled to undergo inguinal hernia repair or orchiopexy under sevoflurane anaesthesia.Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: (1) HT7 group: unilateral (right side) stimulation of the HT7 acupuncture point using a single-twitch electrical stimulus (1 Hz, 50 mA) throughout the surgery, and (2) control group: electrodes alone were attached to the HT7 point on the right side; an electrical stimulus was not applied.The primary outcome was the incidence of EA evaluated using the pediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scale. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of EA evaluated using Aono's scale, the severity of EA, PACU stay duration, and postoperative pain.There was no statistical difference between the incidence of EA in the HT7 and the control group (28.0% and 24.0%, respectively; P > 0.99). The risk ratio was 1.17 (95% confidence interval: 0.60-2.27).We observed that there was no effect of unilateral single-twitch electrical stimulation to the HT7 on the incidence of EA, contrary to the findings with bilateral HT7 stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2896270600,"Letter identification is an early metric of reading ability that can be reliability tested before a child can decode words. We test the hypothesis that early speech production will be associated with children’s later letter identification. We examined longitudinal growth in early speech production in 9 typically developing children across eight occasions, every 3 months from 9 months to 30 months. At each occasion, participants and their caregivers engaged in a speech sample in a research lab. This speech sample was transcribed for a variety of vocalizations, which were then transformed to calculate consonant-vowel ratio. Consonant-vowel ratio is a measure of phonetic complexity in speech production. At the age of 72 months, children’s letter knowledge was measured. A multilevel model including fixed quadratic age change and a random intercept was estimated using letter identification as a predictor of the growth in early speech production from 9–30 months, measured by the outcome of consonant-vowel ratio. Results revealed that the relation between early speech production and letter identification differed over time. For each additional letter that a child identified, their consonant-vowel ratio at the age of 9 months increased. As such, these results confirmed our hypothesis: more robust early speech production is associated with more accurate letter identification."
https://openalex.org/W2897009725,"The causes of seasonal variability in pathogen transmission are not well understood, and have not been comprehensively investigated. In an example for enteric pathogens, incidence of Escherichia coli O157 (STEC) colonization in cattle is consistently higher during warmer months compared to cooler months in various cattle production systems. However, actual mechanisms for this seasonality remain elusive. In addition, the influence of host (cattle) behavior on this pattern has not been thoroughly considered. To that end, we constructed a spatially explicit agent-based model that accounted for the effect of temperature fluctuations on cattle behavior (direct contact among cattle and indirect between cattle and environment), as well as its effect on pathogen survival in the environment. We then simulated the model in a factorial approach to evaluate the hypothesis that temperature fluctuations can lead to seasonal STEC transmission dynamics by influencing cattle aggregation, grazing, and drinking behaviors. Simulation results showed that higher temperatures increased the frequency at which cattle aggregated under shade in pasture, resulting in increased direct contact and transmission of STEC between individual cattle, and hence higher incidence over model simulations in the warm season. In contrast, increased drinking behavior during warm season was not an important transmission pathway. Although sensitivity analyses suggested that the relative importance of direct vs. indirect (environmental) pathways depend to upon model parameterization, model simulations indicated that factors influencing cattle aggregation, such as temperature, were likely strong drivers of transmission dynamics of enteric pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2896235210,"Today, many complex tasks are assigned to teams, rather than individuals. One reason for teaming up is expansion of the skill coverage of each individual to the joint team skill set. However, numerous empirical studies of human groups suggest that the performance of equally skilled teams can widely differ. Two natural question arise: What are the factors defining team performance? and How can we best predict the performance of a given team on a specific task? While the team members’ task-related capabilities constrain the potential for the team’s success, the key to understanding team performance is in the analysis of the team process, encompassing the behaviors of the team members during task completion. In this study, we extend the existing body of research on team process and prediction models of team performance. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of historical team performance over a series of tasks as well as the fine-grained patterns of collaboration between team members, and formally connect these dynamics to the team performance in the predictive models. Our major qualitative finding is that higher performing teams have well-connected collaboration networks—as indicated by the topological and spectral properties of the latter—which are more robust to perturbations, and where network processes spread more efficiently. Our major quantitative finding is that our predictive models deliver accurate team performance predictions—with a prediction error of 15-25%—on a variety of simple tasks, outperforming baseline models that do not capture the micro-level dynamics of team member behaviors. We also show how to use our models in an application, for optimal online planning of workload distribution in an organization. Our findings emphasize the importance of studying the dynamics of team collaboration as the major driver of high performance in teams."
https://openalex.org/W2897018598,"In Europe, brown hare (Lepus europaeus) populations have been declining steadily since the 1970s. Gamekeepers can help to support brown hare wild populations by releasing cage-reared hares into the wild. Survival rates of cage-reared hares has been investigated in previous studies, however, survival times in relation to seasonality, which likely plays a crucial role for the efficacy of this management strategy, has not been evaluated. Here we examine the survival duration and daytime home ranges of 22 hares released and radio-tracked during different periods of the year in East Bohemia, Czech Republic. The majority of hares (82%) died within the first six months after release, and 41% individuals died within the first 10 days. Significant differences were found in the duration of survival with respect to the release date. Hares released in the summer months (July and August) survived the longest (on average 103.2 days, SD ± 23.8) and hares released throughout all other months of the year survived for significantly shorter periods of time (on average 20.4 days, SD ± 11.5). The most likely cause of death was red fox predation (38.9%) followed by disease (coccidiosis and other health problems) (27.8%). Three hares (16.6%) were killed by automobile traffic. After six months of radiotracking, we found the average survival time of all hares released was 58 (SD ± 70.9) days. Hares in this study preferred to remain in the vicinity of the release area and the average distance from release point to the center of the home range was 471 m."
https://openalex.org/W2897062281,"Glutathione S‒transferases (GSTs) are multifunctional enzymes that play an important role in detoxification, cellular signalling, and the stress response. Camelus dromedarius is well-adapted to survive in extreme desert climate and it has GSTs, for which limited information is available. This study investigated the structure-function and thermodynamic properties of a mu-class camel GST (CdGSTM1) at different pH. Recombinant CdGSTM1 (25.7 kDa) was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Dimeric CdGSTM1 dissociated into stable but inactive monomeric subunits at low pH. Conformational and thermodynamic changes during the thermal unfolding pathway of dimeric and monomeric CdGSTM1 were characterised via a thermal shift assay and dynamic multimode spectroscopy (DMS). The thermal shift assay based on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence revealed that CdGSTM1 underwent a two-state unfolding pathway at pH 1.0–10.0. Its Tm value varied with varying pH. Another orthogonal technique based on far-UV CD also exhibited two-state unfolding in the dimeric and monomeric states. Generally, proteins tend to lose structural integrity and stability at low pH; however, monomeric CdGSTM1 at pH 2.0 was thermally more stable and unfolded with lower van't Hoff enthalpy. The present findings provide essential information regarding the structural, functional, and thermodynamic properties of CdGSTM1 at pH 1.0–10.0."
https://openalex.org/W2897111944,"Rapid cooling and re-warming has been shown promising to cryopreserve living cells, which cannot be preserved by conventional slow freezing methods. However, success is limited by the cytotoxicity of highly concentrated cryoprotective agents. Recent results have shown that cryoprotective agents do not need to suppress intracellular ice crystals completely to allow for survival after cryopreservation. Cryoprotective agents like DMSO or ethylene glycol can also lead to a tolerance of cells towards intracellular ice. It is however unclear by which mechanism this tolerance is achieved. These substances are also known to modulate properties of cellular membranes. It is shown here that cryoprotective DMSO and ethylene glycol have a clear influence on the mobility of lipids in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. To isolate changes of the properties of plasma membranes from effects on ice formation, the membrane properties were modulated in absence of cryoprotective agents. This was achieved by changing their sterol content. In cells with elevated sterol content, an immobile lipid fraction was present, similar to cells treated with DMSO and ethylene glycol. These cells showed also significantly increased plasma membrane integrity after rapid freezing and thawing in the absence of classical cryoprotective agents. However, their intracellular lysosomes, which cannot be enriched with sterols, still got ruptured. These results clearly indicate that a modulation of membrane properties can convey cryoprotection. Upon slow cooling, elevated sterol content had actually an adverse effect on the plasma membranes, which shows that this effect is specific for rapid, non-equilibrium cooling processes. Unraveling this alternative mode of action of cryoprotection should help in the directed design of novel cryoprotective agents, which might be less cytotoxic than classical, empirically-found cryoprotective agents."
https://openalex.org/W2897495883,"Background It is still unknown whether the excessive length of the first ray is a risk factor for hallux valgus recurrence. The purpose of this study is to clarify the relationship between the excessive length of the first ray and the recurrence of hallux valgus. Methods Between 2008 and 2011, a total of 186 feet (left 105, right 81) who underwent chevron osteotomy combined with distal soft tissue procedure in our foot and ankle center were retrospectively reviewed. A postoperative hallux valgus angle(HVA) ≥20° was defined as recurrence. Patients were divided into two groups: recurrence and non-recurrence group. Weight-bearing radiographs were evaluated preoperatively and at the time of last follow-up for both groups. Radiographic parameters including the length of the great toe(P1), the length of the second toe(P2), the length distance between the first and second metatarsal(D), the hallux valgus angle(HVA) were obtained. The excessive length of the first ray(EL) was calculated using the equation of EL = P1-P2-D. Results A total of 45 patients (24.2%) had hallux valgus recurrence at the time of last follow-up with a mean follow-up of 83.7 ±12.1 months (range, 66–110). The mean postoperative P1 was 5.06±0.39cm for recurrence group and 4.84±0.34cm for no recurrence group(p<0.001). The mean post operative EL was 5.71±5.01mm for recurrence group and 1.61±4.09mm for no recurrence group(p<0.001). The predictive cutoff value of postoperative P1 and postoperative EL for hallux valgus recurrence was 4.9cm [odds ratio (OR) = 8.67, p = 0.03] and 0.4cm (OR = 6.79, p = 0.001) respectively. Conclusions Significant relationships between postoperative P1, postoperative EL and hallux valgus recurrence were identified according to our radiographic results. A postoperative P1>4.9cm and postoperative EL>0.4cm can be risk factors for hallux valgus recurrence. The appreciation of the excessive length of the first ray prior to surgery may help to improve the surgical outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2897630582,"Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a preclinical oral prophylaxis education program by examining the effectiveness of the teaching module on changes to the students’ attitudes towards their individual hygiene behaviors with interdental brushes (IDBs). Methods As being part of a new didactic program on oral interproximal prophylaxis, all preclinical third-year students (n = 96) enrolled in the 2014/15 academic year received theoretical, preclinical, and clinical lessons on interproximal prophylaxis. The evaluation of educational outcomes was linked to observed changes in students' hygiene behaviors using interdental brushes. Knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, competence and performance were also explored. The evaluation interviews were recorded at each recall, i.e., 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 1 year after baseline. Results Motivation to use IDBs is clearly related to the perception of the effectiveness of the brushes and the perception of bleeding reduction. At one week, 89.6% of subjects reported using IDBs. Individual use decreased significantly from one week to one month (-26%, p = 0.006) while a non-significant upward trend occurred between one month and three months. Among students reporting usage of IDBs at 1 year (20.8%), only 2.0% used IDBs daily. Most students would recommend IDBs to other people at the beginning (69.8%). However, this share dropped to 50% at 3 months. IDB-users prescribed more than non-users. Discussion and public health implications The implementation of a module on interdental hygiene practices in the oral health program is strongly recommended. However, corrective measures should be considered regarding the organization and frequency of recall periods in order to improve the performance of the curriculum."
https://openalex.org/W2897658927,"Vibrational communication is known in some subterranean insects. Except for their use in sexual signaling, vibration behavior has rarely been reported. We report here four distinct types of substrate-based vibration behaviors in the mole cricket, Gryllotalpa orientalis, which are not associated with sexual signaling because of the occurrence of these behaviors in nymphs: (1) scraping with the forelegs; (2) foreleg taps (tapping with the forelegs); (3) palpal taps (tapping with the maxillary palpi); and (4) tremulation (back-and-forth movement of the whole body). Scraping is hypothesized to be used for the inspection of borrows. Foreleg taps are possibly informing nearby individuals of their presence, because it is never observed in solitary conditions. Palpal taps are rarely observed and its function is unknown. Tremulation is possibly related to avoidance of conspecific individual approaching and touching. The combination of the four vibration behaviors in the mole cricket may be unique among insects."
https://openalex.org/W2895864967,"Biobotics investigates the use of live insects as biological robots whose locomotion can be controlled by neurostimulation through implanted electrodes. Inactivity in the biobots (biological robots) can sometimes be noticed following extended neurostimulation, partly owing to incompatibility of implanted electrodes with the biobotic application or gradual degradation of the tissue-electrode interface. Implanted electrodes need to sufficiently exhibit consistent, reliable, and stable performance during stimulation experiments, have low tissue-electrode impedance, facilitate good charge injection capacity, and be compact in size or shape. Towards the goal of finding such electrodes suitable for biobotic applications, we compare electrochemical performances of five different types of electrodes in vitro with a saline based electrolytic medium. These include stainless steel wire electrodes, microfabricated flexible gold electrodes coated with PEDOT:PSS conductive polymer, eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) in a tube, and “hybrid” stainless steel electrodes coated with EGaIn. We also performed accelerated aging of the electrodes to help estimate their longitudinal performance. Based on our experimentation, microfabricated electrodes with PEDOT:PSS and stainless steel electrodes coated with EGaIn performed remarkably well. This is the first time conductive polymer and liquid metal electrodes were studied comparatively for neurostimulation applications. These in vitro comparison results will be used in the future to provide a benchmark for subsequent in vivo tests with implanted electrodes in cockroach biobots."
https://openalex.org/W2897337985,"Background and purpose The astroglial protein GFAP is a blood biomarker indicative of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with acute stroke. Due to its brain specificity and the necessity of brain damage for its detectability in blood, we hypothesized that GFAP could be an interesting marker in cases with primary cerebral cause of death, e.g., traumatic brain injury. Methods All corpses scheduled for an autopsy in the Frankfurt Department of Forensic medicine within a 15-month period were included in the study. Cases with a known history of brain disease in the 3 months before death were excluded. During autopsy, blood was collected and GFAP serum levels were determined using a commercially available ELISA. The autopsy protocols were reviewed for the presence of a primary cerebral or a primary non-cerebral cause of death. Agony time was also determined. Results A total of 129 autopsy cases were included. GFAP concentrations did not differ between cerebral (median 0.96 μg/l, IQR 5.03) and non-cerebral causes of death (1.21 μg/l, 3.58). GFAP levels were found to be unaffected by hemolysis or post-mortem interval. GFAP levels were found to be increased in cases with prolonged agony times (median 1.76 μg/l [IQR 4.70]) compared to short (0.58 μg/l [0.58]; p<0.001) and ultra-short agony times (0.21 μg/l [0.12]; p = 0.002). Conclusion Post-mortem GFAP serum concentrations correlate with agony time and might therefore be useful for the evaluation of the severity of brain damage in prolonged death. Elevated GFAP serum levels do not indicate a primary cerebral cause of death."
https://openalex.org/W2895910030,"Objectives Clinical practice guidelines have the potential to improve care, but are often not optimally implemented. Improving guideline use in clinical practice may improve care. The objective of this study was to identify the barriers and facilitators (determinants) of guidelines use among neurologists and to propose a strategy to improve guideline implementation. Methods This was a mixed-methods study design. A quantitative, population-based, cross-sectional survey of Canadian neurologists was conducted. Associations between guidelines use and determinants of guidelines use were examined. Focus groups and interviews were conducted using purposeful sampling of the population. Determinants of guideline use were mapped to interventions to establish a strategy for guideline implementation among neurologists. Results 38.7% (n = 311) of neurologists responded to the survey. Typically, respondents had been practicing for 16.6 years and worked in an academic institution in an urban setting. Being male and having an academic affiliation was associated with guideline use. Determinants of guideline use differed between guideline users and non-users; non-users consistently rating determinants lower than users, especially applicability. Two focus groups and one interview (n = 11) identified six main themes of determinants of guideline use: Credibility, knowledge, applicability, resources, motivation, and target audience; which was congruent with the quantitative data. The proposed knowledge translation strategy contains three pillars: guidelines development, dissemination, and interventions. Conclusions Several determinants of guideline use not commonly discussed in the literature were identified (applicability, target audience, credibility). The proposed implementation strategy is a valuable resource for guideline developers and policy/decision-makers to improve knowledge translation of guidelines among neurologists."
https://openalex.org/W2896281991,"This study examined the effect of changes in body temperature during exercise on signal transduction-related glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic rats. Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats (25 weeks of age), which have type 2 diabetes, were divided into the following four weight-matched groups; control (CON, n = 6), exercised under warm temperature (WEx, n = 8), exercised under cold temperature (CEx, n = 8), and heat treatment (HT, n = 6). WEx and CEx animals were subjected to running on a treadmill at 20 m/min for 30 min under warm (25°C) or cold (4°C) temperature. HT animals were exposed to single heat treatment (40-41°C for 30 min) in a heat chamber. Rectal and muscle temperatures were measured immediately after exercise and heat treatment, and the gastrocnemius muscle was sampled under anesthesia. Rectal and muscle temperatures increased significantly in rats in the WEx and HT, but not the CEx, groups. The phosphorylation levels of Akt, AS160, and TBC1D1 (Thr590) were significantly higher in the WEx and HT groups than the CON group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase, ACC, and TBC1D1 (Ser660) were significantly higher in rats in the WEx and CEx groups than the CON group (p < 0.05) but did not differ significantly between rats in the WEx and CEx groups. Body temperature elevation by heat treatment did not activate the AMPK signaling. Our data suggest that body temperature elevation during exercise is essential for activating the Akt signaling pathway in the skeletal muscle of rats with type 2 diabetic rats."
https://openalex.org/W2896846134,"Due to the significant role of rotational properties for normal knee function, this study aimed to investigate transverse plane kinematics and kinetics in total knee arthroplasty and unicondylar knee arthroplasty patients during activities of daily living compared to a healthy control group, including stair ascent and descent. The study participants consisted of a total knee arthroplasty group including posterior cruciate retaining and posterior stabilized designs as well as a unicondylar knee arthroplasty group and a healthy control group. Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were captured using a Vicon system and two Kistler force plates embedded in the floor and another two in a staircase. Inverse dynamics of the lower limbs was computed in Anybody™ Modeling System. Transverse plane joint angles and joint moments were analyzed utilizing the statistical non-parametric mapping approach, considering the entire curve shape for statistical analysis. The patients with total knee arthroplasty exhibited significantly reduced knee internal rotation of the operated knee compared to the control group and the patients’ unimpaired limb, especially during the stair climbing tasks. Both unicondylar and total knee arthroplasty patients were found to have similar reduced internal rotation motion time series in stair descent. In conclusion, potential kinematic and kinetic benefits of unicondylar knee arthroplasty over total knee arthroplasty could not be proven in the current study. Aside from the usually mentioned reasons inducing constrained knee internal rotation in total knee arthroplasty patients, future studies should investigate to what extent co-contraction may contribute to this functional impairment in patients after knee arthroplasty surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2895988511,"Marine managers routinely use spatial data to make decisions about their marine environment. Uncertainty associated with this spatial data can have profound impacts on these management decisions and their projected outcomes. Recent advances in modeling techniques, including species distribution models (SDMs), make it easier to generate continuous maps showing the uncertainty associated with spatial predictions and maps. However, SDM predictions and maps can be complex and nuanced. This complexity makes their use challenging for non-technical managers, preventing them from having the best available information to make decisions. To help bridge these communication and information gaps, we developed maps to illustrate how SDMs and associated uncertainty can be translated into readily usable products for managers. We also explicitly described the potential impacts of uncertainty on marine zoning decisions. This approach was applied to a case study in Saipan Lagoon, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Managers in Saipan are interested in minimizing the potential impacts of personal watercraft (e.g., jet skis) on staghorn Acropora (i.e., Acropora aspera, A. formosa, and A. pulchra), which is an important coral assemblage in the lagoon. We used a recently completed SDM for staghorn Acropora to develop maps showing the sensitivity of zoning options to three different prediction and three different uncertainty thresholds (nine combinations total). Our analysis showed that the amount of area and geographic location of predicted staghorn Acropora presence changed based on these nine combinations. These dramatically different spatial patterns would have significant zoning implications when considering where to exclude and/or allow jet skis operations inside the lagoon. They also show that different uncertainty thresholds may lead managers to markedly different conclusions and courses of action. Defining acceptable levels of uncertainty upfront is critical for ensuring that managers can make more informed decisions, meet their marine resource goals and generate favorable outcomes for their stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W2896664235,"The protozoan Phytomonas serpens (class Kinetoplastea) is an important phytoparasite that has gained medical importance due to its similarities to Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. The present work describes the first proteome analysis of P. serpens. The parasite was separated into cytosolic and high density organelle fractions, which, together with total cell extract, were subjected to LC-MS/MS analyses. Protein identification was conducted using a comprehensive database composed of genome sequences of other related kinetoplastids. A total of 1,540 protein groups were identified among the three sample fractions. Sequences from Phytomonas sp. in the database allowed the highest number of identifications, with T. cruzi and T. brucei the human pathogens providing the greatest contribution to the identifications. Based on the proteomics data obtained, we proposed a central metabolic map of P. serpens, which includes all enzymes of the citric acid cycle. Data also revealed a new range of proteins possibly responsible for immunological cross-reactivity between P. serpens and T. cruzi."
https://openalex.org/W2896955691,"Objectives and study This study aimed at measuring the effect in normal to restricted protein diets with specific 15N natural isotopic abundance (NIA) given during gestation and/or lactation on the 15N NIA of fur, liver and muscle in dams and their offspring from birth to adulthood. The secondary aim was to study the effect of growth on the same parameters. Methods Female Balb/c mice were fed normal protein diet containing 22% protein or isocaloric low protein diet containing 10% protein throughout gestation. Dam’s diets were either maintained or switched to the other diet until weaning at 30 days. All animals were fed standard chow thereafter. Offspring were sacrificed at 1, 11, 30, 60, 480 days and a group of dams at d1. Growth was modeled as an exponential function on the group followed up until 480 days. Fur, liver and muscle were sampled at sacrifice and analyzed for bulk 15N NIA. Fixed effects and interactions between fixed effects and random elements were tested by three-way ANOVA. Results Higher 15N NIA in the diet resulted in higher organ 15N NIA. Switching from one diet to another changed 15N NIA in each organ. Although dam and offspring shared the same isotopic environment during gestation, 15N NIA at day 1 was higher in dams. Growth rate did not differ between groups after 10 days and decreased between 1 and 5 months. 15N NIA differed between organs and was affected by growth and gestation/lactation. Conclusion Dietary 15N NIA is a major determinant of the 15N NIA of organs. 15N NIA depended on organ and age (i.e. growth) suggesting an effect of metabolism and/or dilution space. Post-natal normal-protein diet of lactating dams could reverse the effect of a protein-restricted diet during gestation on the offspring growth. Measuring 15N NIA in various matrices may open a field of application particularly useful in studying the pre- and post-natal origins of health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2792165983,"A freight train service network generally involves two categories of trains: unscheduled trains, whose operating frequencies fluctuate with the freight demand, and scheduled trains, which are operated based on regular timetables similar to passenger trains. The timetables for scheduled trains are released to the public once determined, and they are not influenced by the freight demand. Typically, the total capacity of scheduled trains can satisfy the predicted average demand of express cargos. However, in practice, the demand always changes. Therefore, a method to assign the shipments to scheduled and unscheduled train services has become an important issue faced in railway transportation. This paper focuses on the coordinated optimization of rail express cargo assignment in a hybrid train services network. On the premise of fully utilizing the capacity of scheduled train services, we propose a car-to-train assignment model to reasonably assign rail express cargos to scheduled and unscheduled trains. The objective aims to maximize the profit of transporting the rail express cargos. The constraints include the capacity restriction on the service arcs, flow balance constraints, transportation due date constraints and logical relationship constraints among the decision variables. Furthermore, we discuss a linearization technique to convert the nonlinear transportation due date constraint into a linear constraint, making it possible to solve by a standard optimization solver. Finally, an illustrative case study based on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Line is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solution approach."

In this study, we first establish a punishment mechanism that substantially enhances honest behavior and trust in a sender-receiver game: the possibility to impose severe sanctions that are cost-free for enforcers. Adopting this effective mechanism, we investigate how variations in the probability of detecting lies affect sender and receiver. We find that high honesty levels persist under such punishment mechanism even when the detection probability is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the relationship between monitoring and honesty does not follow a linear trend, as a moderate monitoring level proves to be less effective in enhancing honesty than high or very low levels. The punishment mechanism has an even more robust effect on receivers, showing similarly high levels of trust independently of the detection probability. Our analysis of subjects’ beliefs provides further insights into the mechanics behind these behavioral patterns."

Stabilometry can provide insights about postural control and guide preventive interventions in immature perceptual and musculoskeletal systems as those seen in children with CMT. This cross-sectional study aimed to identify and interpret stabilometric variables that reflect the postural control of children with CMT. 53 subjects (age 6-17) were assigned to one of the two groups: CMT (15 males and 14 females with CMT) or Control (13 males and 11 females healthy). Quiet standing was tested in different conditions: with open and closed eyes on regular surface (open-regular, closed-regular) and foam surface (open-foam, closed-foam) using a force platform. The minimum of 2 and maximum of 3 trials of 30 seconds for each test condition provided the classical stabilometric variables and Romberg Quotient (RQv). CMT group showed increase of confidence ellipse area, mean velocity, mediolateral and anteroposterior velocities associated with decreased mean body oscillation frequency, as the complexity of tasks increased. CMT postural deficit was identified by greater and faster sway associated with these lower frequencies, when compared to Control."

Material and methods We treated with SBRT 3 patients (pts) affected by a cholangiocarcinoma and 3 patient presenting liver metastases (3x15 Gy, 4 pts; 5x8 Gy, 1 pt; 6x5 Gy, 1 pt). All patients received HBS before and 3 months after SBRT, which were co-registered with the simulation CT-scan. Structures corresponding to isodoses from 10–90 Gy were created, with intervals of 10 Gy. Finally, the variations of the mean activity (MBq) in each isodose structure have been calculated. Then, a linear regression analysis was performed. Results We showed a linear reduction of the activity, significantly related to the delivered dose (p<0.01), and a reduction of the perfusion of 0.78% for each delivered Gy. The linear equation has predictive value of the loss of the function of 96% (R2 = 0.9605). Conclusions HBS could improve treatment plans for liver SBRT, by allowing the identification of the liver function variations after SBRT and, potentially, the prediction of remnant liver function after SBRT. These preliminary results should be confirmed on long-term prospective data and larger population."
https://openalex.org/W2895917791,"It is estimated that two million new dental implants are inserted worldwide each year. Innovative implant materials are developed in order to minimize the risk of peri-implant inflammations. The broad range of material testing is conducted using standard 2D, terminal, and invasive methods. The methods that have been applied are not sufficient to monitor the whole implant surface and temporal progress. Therefore, we built a 3D peri-implant model using a cylindrical implant colonized by human gingival fibroblasts. In order to monitor the cell response over time, a non-toxic LIVE/DEAD staining was established and applied to the new 3D model. Our LIVE/DEAD staining method in combination with the time resolved 3D visualization using Scanning Laser Optical Tomography (SLOT), allowed us to monitor the cell death path along the implant in the 3D peri-implant model. The differentiation of living and dead gingival fibroblasts in response to toxicity was effectively supported by the LIVE/DEAD staining. Furthermore, it was possible to visualize the whole cell-colonized implant in 3D and up to 63 hours. This new methodology offers the opportunity to record the long-term cell response on external stress factors, along the dental implant and thus to evaluate the performance of novel materials/surfaces."
