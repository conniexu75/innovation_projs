https://openalex.org/W1970203885,"The oxygen of anhydrous, high-temperature minerals in carbonaceous meteorites is strongly depleted in the heavy stable isotopes 17O and 18O. The effect is the result of nuclear rather than chemical processes and probably results from the admixture of a component of almost pure 16O. This component may predate the solar system and may represent interstellar dust with a separate history of nucleosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999850900,"The principal raw material of modern U.S. agriculture is fossil fuel, whereas the labor input is relatively small (about 9 hours per crop acre). As agriculture is dependent upon fossil energy, crop production costs will also soar when fuel costs increase two- to fivefold. A return of 2.8 kcal of corn per 1 kcal of fuel input may then be uneconomical. Green revolution agriculture also uses high energy crop production technology, especially with respect to fertilizers and pesticides. While one may not doubt the sincerity of the U.S. effort to share its agricultural technology so that the rest of the world can live and eat as it does, one must be realistic about the resources available to accomplish this mission. In the United States we are currently using an equivalent of 80 gallons of gasoline to produce an acre of corn. With fuel shortages and high prices to come, we wonder if many developing nations will be able to afford the technology of U.S. agriculture. Problems have already occurred with green revolution crops, particularly problems related to pests (57). More critical problems are expected when there is a world energy crisis. A careful assessment should be made of the benefits, costs, and risks of high energy-demand green revolution agriculture in order to be certain that this program will not aggravate the already serious world food situation (58). To reduce energy inputs, green revolution and U.S. agriculture might employ such alternatives as rotations and green manures to reduce the high energy demand of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. U.S. agriculture might also reduce energy expenditures by substituting some manpower currently displaced by mechanization. While no one knows for certain what changes will have to be made, we can be sure that when conventional energy resources become scarce and expensive, the impact on agriculture as an industry and a way of life will be significant. This analysis is but a preliminary investigation of a significant agricultural problem that deserves careful attention and greater study before the energy situation becomes more critical."
https://openalex.org/W2036215206,"Probably in early 1967, a piscivore from South America, Cichla ocellaris, was introduced to Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal Zone. As this predator population spread through the lake, the initial effect was dramatic reductions in almost all secondary consumers. These species reductions produced, in turn, second- and third-order changes at other trophic levels of the ecosystem. The resulting changes in the lake community can be seen best by examining the general Gatun Lake food web. The decrease in numbers of the important planktivore Melaniris has resulted in changes within the zooplankton community, as illustrated by the cladoceran Ceriodaphnia. The tertiary-consumer populations, such as tarpon, black terns, kingfishers, and herons, formerly dependent on small fishes for food, appear less frequently in the Cichla areas of the lake. There has also been, possibly, a resurgence of the local mosquito populations (which are malaria vectors), caused by the reduction in the populations of insect-eating fishes. Even the primary producers may be affected by this introduction. Although at present the Gatun Lake ecosystem is undergoing rapid changes, we anticipate an eventual return to some form of equilibrium. However, it will be some time before we can evaluate the permanence or transience of the many changes produced in the trophic levels by the introduction of a single, top-level predator to this lake system."

https://openalex.org/W2008411088,"The mandibular gland secretions of the ponerine ants Odontomachus hastatus, O. clarus, and O. brunneus contain alkylpyrazines. These compounds, 2,5-dimethyl-3-isopentylpyrazine in O. hastatus and O. clarus, and 2,6-dimethyl-3-pentyl-, -butyl-, -propyl-, and -ethyl-pyrazines in O. brunneus, have previously not been found as animal natural products. These compounds function as powerful releasers of alarm behavior for Odontomachus workers and are probably also utilized as defensive compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2044533384,The magnitude of the temperature increase that occurred in continental regions following the termination of the last glaciation has been determined from the degree of racemization of aspartic acid in fossil bones of known age. The results indicate an increase of 4°C for the Mediterranean coast and 5° to 6°C for East Africa. These estimates are believed to be reliable within 1°C.
https://openalex.org/W1984318938,"The residual frost caps of Mars are probably water-ice. They may be the source of the water vapor associated with seasonal polar hoods. A permanent reservoir of solid CO(2) is also probably present within the north residual cap and may comprise a mass of CO(2) some two to five times that of the present atmosphere of Mars. The martian atmospheric pressure is probably regulated by the temperature of the reservoir and not by the annual heat balance of exposed solid CO(2) (37). The present reservoir temperature presumably reflects a long-term average of the polar heat balance. The question of a large permanent north polar cap is reexamined in light of the Mariner 9 data. The lower general elevation of the north polar region compared to the south and the resulting occurrence in the north of a permanent CO(2) deposit are probably responsible for the differences in size and shape of the two residual caps. The details of the processes involved are less apparent, however. It might be argued that the stability of water-ice deposits depends on both insolation and altitude. The present north and south residual caps should be symmetrically located with respect to such a hypothetical stability field. However, the offset of the south cap from the geometrical pole, the non-symmetrical outline of the north cap, and the apparently uniform thickness of the thin, widespread water-ice all argue against control by simple solid-vapor equilibrium of water under present environmental conditions. We think that the present location of the water-ice may reflect, in part, the past location of the permanent CO(2) reservoir. The extreme stability of polar water-ice deposits increases the likelihood that past environmental conditions may be recorded there. Detailed information on elevations in the vicinity of the residual caps is needed before we can further elucidate the nature and history of the residual caps. This, along with measurements of polar infrared emission, should be given high priority in future missions to Mars. Two conclusions follow from the limitation of the mass of solid CO(2) on Mars at present to two to five times the mass of CO(2) in the atmosphere. If all of this CO(2) was entirely sublimated into the atmosphere as a result of hypothetical astronomical or geophysical effects, the average surface pressure would increase to 15 to 30 mbar. Although such a change would have considerable significance for eolian erosion and transportation, there seems to be little possibility that a sufficiently earthlike atmosphere could result for liquid water to become an active erosional agent, as postulated by Milton (38). The pressure broadening required for a green-house effect requires at least 10 to 20 times more pressure (39). If liquid water was ever active in modifying the martian surface, it must have been at an earlier epoch, before the present, very stable CO(2)/H(2)O system developed. There can be no intermittent earthlike episodes now. Furthermore, the present abundance of CO(2) on Mars may be an indicator of the cumulative evolution of volatiles to the surface of the planet (40). Thus, even the possibility of an earlier earth-like episode is dimmed. On Mars, the total CO(2) definitely outgassed has evidently been about 60 +/- 20 g/cm(2). On the earth, about 70 +/- 30 kg/cm(2) of CO(2) have been released to the surface (41). Hence, the total CO(2) devolved by Mars per unit area is about 0.1 percent of that evolved by the earth. Thus, the observational limits we place on solid CO(2) presently located under the north residual cap also may constitute considerable constraints on the total differentiation and devolatilization of the planet. If they are valid, it would seem unlikely that Mars has devolatilized at all like the earth, or ever experienced an earthlike environment on its surface."
https://openalex.org/W2052985633,"Data from a traverse connecting Byrd Station, Antarctica, with the local ice divide allow calculation of the mean volume flux at points along the traverse. This is compared with current rates of surface accretion upstream from each point. Near the ice divide the ice sheet seems to be in equilibrium, but near Byrd Station the volume flux is in excess of that needed for ice sheet equilibrium by at least 15 percent. The discrepancy may exist because the traverse does not follow the ice flow exactly or because ice flow at depth is very complex. Although neither of the foregoing possibilities can be disproved, it seems most likely that the discrepancy is due to ice sheet thinning, as has previously been suggested by work on oxygen isotope ratios and temperature in the boreholes at Byrd Station. This thinning probably started at the end of the Wisconsin/Würm glaciation. Causes for the thinning are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1996197080,The very-high-resolution radiometer on the NOAA-2 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite has recently obtained imagery in the visible channel containing sunglint over a major portion of the coastal waters off the eastern seaboard of the United States. An abrupt change in surface roughness has been observed at the shoreward edge of the Gulf Stream Current from Florida to Cape Hatteras that results from the opposition of waves propagating against the flow of the Gulf Stream.

https://openalex.org/W2008835252,"A report released on 10/15/73 by the National Academy of Sciences' Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface-Mined for Coal in the Western United States indicates that enough water is available for mining and rehabilitation at most sites, but not enough for large-scale power generation and coal gasification. The North Central Power Study, published in Oct. 1971 by 25 utilities, proposed the coal-fired generation of up to 50,000 MW at 42 sites by 2000; they would consume up to 855,000 acre-ft/yr of water. With gasification and liquefaction plants, water demands would rise to 2.6 million acre-ft/yr. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reported in Apr. 1972 that 3.2 million acre-ft/yr (about one-third of the average flow) could be diverted from the Yellowstone River and its tributaries in Wyoming and Montana. Groups concerned for irrigation, wildlife, recreation, and industries other than coal feel that most of the surplus water upon which future developments depend has been quietly tagged for coal development without regard for long-range economic consequences, and have filed a suit to void such water options."
