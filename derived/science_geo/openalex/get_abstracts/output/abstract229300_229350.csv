https://openalex.org/W2051393367,"Biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1 (BLOC-1) is a ubiquitously expressed multisubunit protein complex required for the normal biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules. The complex is known to contain the coiled-coil-forming proteins, Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin. The genes encoding these proteins are defective in inbred mouse strains that serve as models of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), a genetic disorder characterized by hypopigmentation and platelet storage pool deficiency. In addition, mutation of human Dysbindin causes HPS type 7. Here, we report the identification of another four subunits of the complex. One is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein previously characterized as a binding partner of synaptosomal-associated proteins 25 and 23 and implicated in the regulation of membrane fusion events. The other three are previously uncharacterized proteins, which we named BLOC subunits 1, 2, and 3 (BLOS1, -2, and -3). Using specific antibodies to detect endogenous proteins from human and mouse cells, we found that Snapin, BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3 co-immunoprecipitate, and co-fractionate upon size exclusion chromatography, with previously known BLOC-1 subunits. Furthermore, steady-state levels of the four proteins are significantly reduced in cells from pallid mice, which carry a mutation in Pallidin and display secondary loss of other BLOC-1 subunits. Yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest a network of binary interactions involving all of the previously known and newly identified subunits. Interestingly, the HPS mouse model strain, reduced pigmentation, carries a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding BLOS3. As judged from size exclusion chromatographic analyses, the reduced pigmentation mutation affects BLOC-1 assembly less severely than the pallid mutation. Mutations in the human genes encoding Snapin and the BLOS proteins could underlie novel forms of HPS.

The biogenesis of specialized organelles of the endosomal-lysosomal system, such as melanosomes and platelet dense granules, is controlled by a number of genes that are defective in various forms of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) 1The abbreviations used are: HPS, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; 3AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; BLOC, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex; BLOS, BLOC subunit; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcriptase. 1The abbreviations used are: HPS, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; 3AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; BLOC, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex; BLOS, BLOC subunit; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ORF, open reading frame; RT, reverse transcriptase. in humans and inbred mouse models of the disease (1Huizing M.

Consistent with the roles of melanosomes in melanin synthesis and storage and of platelet dense granules in activation of platelet aggregation, the clinical manifestations common to all forms of HPS are hypopigmentation of hair, skin, and eyes and extended bleeding times due to storage pool deficiency (1Huizing M. Boissy R.E. Gahl W.A. Pigment Cell Res. 2002; 15: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 2Starcevic M. Nazarian R. Dell'Angelica E.C. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Both melanosomes and platelet dense granules are referred to as “lysosome-related organelles” based on genetic and morphological evidence that supports the idea of a common biogenesis pathway with lysosomes (4Dell'Angelica E.C.

Other lysosome-related organelles include azurophil granules (in neutrophils), lytic granules (in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells) and lamellar bodies (in type II lung epithelial cells). Interestingly, additional manifestations observed in subsets of HPS patients and mouse HPS models can be ascribed to defects in lysosomes or related organelles other than melanosomes and platelet dense granules. These manifestations include defective lysosomal enzyme secretion reported for kidney and thrombin-stimulated platelets of several HPS mouse models (reviewed in Ref. 7Swank R.T. Novak E.K.

Examples include those encoding the β3A and δ subunits of the AP-3 complex, which recognizes sorting signals of integral membrane proteins for transport to lysosomes and related organelles (17Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and the gene encoding Vps33a, an ortholog of the yeast Vps33 protein implicated in membrane fusion events within the endosomal-lysosomal system (18Banta L.M.

A. 2000; 97: 9402-9407Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). On the other hand, most genes known to be associated with HPS encode polypeptides that display no homology to any characterized protein. Biochemical analyses of these polypeptides revealed that they are associated into at least three distinct multisubunit complexes, named BLOC-1, -2, and -3. Thus, BLOC-1 is known to contain Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin (16Li W. Zhang Q. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Gautam R. O'Brien E.P. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. Spritz R.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

The possible existence of BLOC-4 and BLOC-5 complexes, sharing some BLOC-3 subunits, has been suggested by one group (25Chiang P.-W. Oiso N. Gautam R. Suzuki T. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. J. Biol.

The genes encoding the Pallidin, Muted, Cappuccino, and Dysbindin subunits are mutated in the pallid, muted, cappuccino, and sandy mouse strains, respectively, which display the most severe coat color dilution phenotypes among known mouse models of HPS (16Li W.

In addition, a nonsense mutation in human Dysbindin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HPS type 7 (16Li W. Zhang Q. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Gautam R. O'Brien E.P. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. Spritz R.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Amato D. Roe B.A. Starcevic M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Elliott R.W. Mishra V. Kingsmore S.F. Paylor R.E. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that the complex exists in soluble (cytosolic) and peripheral membrane protein pools (20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Moriyama K. Bonifacino J.S. Traffic. 2002; 6: 666-677Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the basis of its hydrodynamic properties, the soluble form of bovine and mouse BLOC-1 was predicted to be asymmetric (frictional ratio >2) and to have a native molecular mass of about 200 kDa (16Li W. Zhang Q. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Gautam R. O'Brien E.P. Tinsley C.L. Blake D.J. Spritz R.A. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Amato D. Roe B.A. Starcevic M. Dell'Angelica E.C. Elliott R.W. Mishra V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Importantly, immunoprecipitation of the complex under nondenaturing conditions suggested the possible existence of additional subunits (20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C.

Whereas the molecular function of BLOC-1 remains unknown, some clues have stemmed from the description of potential binding partners of known function. These binding partners include Syntaxin 13 (a SNARE family member involved in membrane fusion at early stages of the endocytic pathway), the α- and β-dystrobrevins (two dystrophin-related proteins that, like Dystrophin, are components of large membrane-associated complexes implicated in membrane stability and signaling events), and actin filaments (20Falcón-Pérez J.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 24232-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report identification of four previously unknown subunits of BLOC-1. One of them is Snapin, a coiled-coil-forming protein originally described as a binding partner of SNAP-25 and SNAP-23, two closely related SNARE proteins implicated in membrane fusion events (31Ilardi J.M. Mochida S. Sheng Z.-H. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 32Burton P. Zhang X.-M. Walsh B. Sriratana A. Schenberg I. Manickam E. Rowe T. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 433-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other three are novel proteins herein referred to as BLOC subunits 1, 2 and 3 (BLOS1, BLOS2, and BLOS3). We also provide evidence that the mouse gene encoding BLOS3 is mutated in the HPS model strain, reduced pigmentation (rp) (33Gibb S. Håkansson E.M. Lundin L.-G. Shire J.G.M. Genet. Res. 1981; 37: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), for which the defective gene had not been identified.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—Yeast two-hybrid plasmids encoding human Pallidin or Muted proteins fused in frame to Gal4 DNA-binding or activation domains have been described previously (20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The cDNA segments comprising the complete ORFs of human Dysbindin (GenBank™ AY265460), Snapin (GenBank™ AF086837), BLOS1 (GenBank™ D64007), and BLOS2 (GenBank™ AY531265) as well as cDNA segments encoding residues 79–125 of BLOS1 (referred to as BLOS1ΔN) and residues 224–351 of Dysbindin were amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA from HeLa cells. The BD Advantage™-GC 2 PCR kit (BD Biosciences) was used to amplify the complete ORF and the region encoding residues 87–202 of human BLOS3 (GenBank™ AY531266) from I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 3627463 and the complete ORF of Cappuccino (GenBank™ NM_018366) from I.M.A.G.E. cDNA clone 5226416 (American Tissue Culture Collection). The resulting cDNA segments were cloned in-frame into the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET-30a(+) (Novagen) vectors to generate GST- and histidine-tagged fusion proteins, respectively. For yeast two-hybrid analysis, the cDNA segments described above, as well as the segment encoding residues 1–273 of human HPS1 (GenBank™ NM_000195), were cloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of the pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors (Clontech) to obtain in-frame fusions with Gal4 DNA-binding and activation domains, respectively. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments—The plasmid encoding full-length human Pallidin fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (in the pGBT9 vector) was transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 (mating type a), and the resulting yeast transformant was allowed to mate with S. cerevisiae strain Y187 (mating type α) pretransformed with a MATCHMAKER cDNA library (in the pGADT7 vector) derived from HeLa cells (Clontech). The resulting diploid cells were selected on SD minimal medium (0.7% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, pH 5.5) supplemented with appropriate auxotrophic requirements except for leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and containing 5 mm 3AT. Colonies that developed within 3 days of culture at 30 °C were transferred to fresh SD medium supplemented as above or modified to contain 10 mm 3AT or to lack 3AT and adenine. Colonies that were able to grow on all of these media were selected, and the cDNA inserts in the activation domain plasmid were PCR-amplified and sequenced.Yeast two-hybrid assays aimed at testing specific interaction pairs were carried out by double transformation of haploid S. cerevisiae strain AH109, as described previously (20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids encoding GST- and histidine-tagged proteins were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α (Invitrogen) and BL21-CodonPlus-(DE3)-RP (Stratagene), respectively. GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant histidine-tagged proteins were purified on TALON® Superflow resin (Clontech). Purified recombinant proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 8.0).Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to Pallidin and Muted were described previously (20Falcón-Pérez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against Dysbindin, BLOS2, and BLOS3 were raised by immunizing rabbits with purified GST-Dysbindin224–351, GST-BLOS2, and GST-BLOS387–202, respectively, and then affinity-purified using the corresponding histidine-tagged versions of the immunogens covalently coupled to Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad). Antibodies to Snapin and BLOS1 were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-Snapin and GST-BLOS1, respectively, affinity-purified using the same proteins coupled to Affi-Gel 15, and then immunoadsorbed using immobilized GST protein. Anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences.Purification of BLOC-1—Frozen bovine liver was purchased from PelFreez (Rogers, AR). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. A portion of a bovine liver (0.8 kg) was homogenized in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/liter leupeptin, 5 mg/liter aprotinin, and 1 mg/liter pepstatin A), using a tissue blender (4 × 15 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min, filtered through gauze, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for another 15 min. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 90 min to obtain a cytosolic extract, which was incubated overnight with DEAE-cellulose resin (Sigma) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (about 50 ml of resin/g of cytosolic protein). Following extensive washing with Buffer A, bound proteins were eluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing the protease inhibitor mixture. A saturated aqueous solution of (NH4)2SO4 was added slowly to the eluted sample to reach a final concentration of 40% saturation. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min, washed twice with (NH4)2SO4 at 40% saturation, and resuspended in Buffer B (300 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing the protease inhibitor mixture. The resuspended material was cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 30 min and loaded onto a Superose 6 column (2.6 × 32 cm) connected to a Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in Buffer B. Elution was performed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Collected fractions (4 ml) were analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of the Pallidin subunit of BLOC-1, and those containing significant amounts of the complex (fractions 23–27) were pooled. The pooled sample was cleared by passage through a column containing Protein A-Sepharose fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) and then applied to an immunoaffinity column that was prepared by cross-linking affinity-purified anti-Pallidin antibody (0.3 mg) to Protein A-Sepharose fast flow beads (0.7 ml) using 40 mm dimethylpimelimidate in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.0). Subsequently, the column was washed with 70 column volumes of Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide) followed by 15 column volumes of Buffer C containing 0.01% (w/v) SDS and 30 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were eluted in 0.1 m triethanolamine (pH 11.5) and collected into a tube containing 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Eluted proteins were concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation (34Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3127) Google Scholar).Protein Identification—Partially purified BLOC-1 was fractionated by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli system) on a 4–20% gradient gel. One part of the gel, containing small aliquots of the purified sample, was silver-stained (35Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 7: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar). The remainder of the gel, containing the bulk of the purified sample, was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and portions of interest were excised. The excised gel portions were submitted to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (Harvard University, Boston, MA) for in-gel tryptic digestion followed by microcapillary reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan CLQ DECA XP Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Proteins in the gel sample were identified by correlating the tandem mass spectrometry spectra with known sequences in public protein data bases, using the Sequest algorithm (36Eng J.K.

Liver cytosolic extracts from the mouse strains C57BL/6J (wild type), pallid (B6.Cg-Pldnpa/J, formerly C57BL/6J-pa), and reduced pigmentation (C57BL-rp/J, purchased from Jackson Laboratories) were prepared by homogenization of minced tissue in Buffer B with protease inhibitors followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min and at 120,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. For size exclusion chromatography, liver cytosol (0.2 ml, ∼6 mg of total protein) was applied to a Superose 6 column (1 × 60 cm) equilibrated and eluted at 4 °C with Buffer B with protease inhibitors at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. The column was calibrated using blue dextran (to determine exclusion volume) and the following standard proteins purchased from Sigma (Stokes radii in parentheses): bovine thyroglobulin (85 Å), bovine serum albumin (36 Å), carbonic anhydrase (24 Å), and horse heart cytochrome c (17 Å).Mutation Analysis and Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from liver and cultured skin fibroblasts (26Nazarian R.

The ORF of BLOS3 was amplified by RT-PCR using the TITANIUM™ one-step RT-PCR kit (BD Biosciences). The RT-PCR product was subsequently gel-purified and sequenced at the UCLA Sequencing and Genotyping Core. For real time PCR analysis, specific primer sets were designed to amplify a fragment of BLOS3 and of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (primer sequences are available upon request). Total RNA isolated from fibroblasts was treated with the TURBO DNA-free™ kit (Ambion) to minimize contamination by genomic DNA and subsequently subjected to reverse transcription using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed on an iCycler™ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) using the iQ™ SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed using the MyiQ software package (Bio-Rad). The signal obtained for BLOS3 was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (as a housekeeping control).RESULTSIdentification of Candidate Subunits of BLOC-1—In order to identify previously unknown subunits of BLOC-1, both biochemical and yeast two-hybrid approaches were undertaken.The biochemical approach involved purifying BLOC-1 by column chromatography and identifying candidate components by mass spectrometry. Bovine liver cytosol was chosen as the starting material, in part due to the availability of large quantities of tissue from a commercial vendor. By quantitative immunoblotting using our antibody to Pallidin, we estimated that the complex may need to be enriched up to ∼18,000 times to achieve biochemical purity. This led us to design a purification scheme in which immunoaffinity chromatography (using our antibody to Pallidin) would be the last, an"

N-Acetylated peptides AcVYK-amide (AcVYK), AcIVYK-amide (AcPHF4), AcQIVYK-amide (AcPHF5), and AcV-QIVYK-amide (AcPHF6) rapidly formed straight filaments in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl, each composed of two laterally aligned protofilaments ∼5 nm in width. X-ray fiber diffraction showed the omnipresent sharp 4.7-Å reflection indicating that the scattering objects are likely elongated along the hydrogen-bonding direction in a cross-β conformation, and Fourier transform IR suggested the peptide chains were in a parallel (AcVYK, AcPHF6) or antiparallel (AcPHF4, AcPHF5) β-sheet configuration. The dipeptide N-acetyl-YK-amide (AcYK) formed globular structures ∼200 nm to 1 μm in diameter. The polymerization rate, as measured by thioflavin S binding, increased with the length of the peptide going from AcYK → AcPHF6, and peptides that aggregated most rapidly displayed CD spectra consistent with β-sheet structure. There was a 3-fold decrease in rate when Val was substituted for Ile or Gln, nearly a 10-fold decrease when Ala was substituted for Tyr, and an increase in polymerization rate when Glu was substituted for Lys. Twisted filaments, composed of four laterally aligned protofilaments (9–19 nm width, ∼90 nm half-periodicity), were formed by mixing AcPHF6 with AcVYK. Taken together these results suggest that the core of PHF6 is localized at VYK, and the interaction between small amphiphilic segments of tau may initiate nucleation and lead to filaments displaying paired helical filament morphology.

The neurofibrillary tangles are composed of straight filaments and paired helical filaments (PHFs), and the morphology of the PHFs is characteristic of the disease pathology. For example in AD, the PHFs appear either as twisted ribbons or pairs of protofilaments wound around one another in a left-handed helical sense with a width alternating between 10 and 20 nm and a half-periodicity of 80 nm, whereas in Pick's disease, the PHFs are slightly wider and have a half-periodicity near 200 nm (4Feany M.B.

Temperature was controlled at 20 °C by using an electrothermal cell holder. Spectra were scanned between 250 and 180 nm with a spectral resolution of 1 nm and an averaging time of 2 s per data point. The spectra reported represent an average of four acquisitions and have been smoothed using boxcar averaging (5-data point average). FTIR Measurements—Lyophilized samples, except for AcPHF6KE, were dissolved in deuterium oxide (D2O) to a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml and allowed to stand at room temperature for 2–14 days prior to spectral acquisition. This aging period allowed for deuterium exchange of the amide backbone hydrogens and formation of filaments. Spectra were obtained by placing 25 μl of sample between two CaF2 plates separated by a 20-μm Teflon spacer. IR spectra of AcPHF6KE, a peptide insoluble in D2O, were obtained by dissolving the peptide in HFIP and allowing the solution to dry onto the CaF2 plates. All FTIR spectra were acquired on a Nicolet Avatar 360 FTIR at 2 cm–1 resolution by averaging 128 transients and subtracting a background spectrum of D2O. Spectra were fit by Gaussian functions using nonlinear deconvolution software (Peakfit®, Systat, Richmond, CA). Kinetics—Polymerization of tau peptides in solutions containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, and 0.15 m NaCl was measured by following the increase in fluorescence of thioflavin S (ThS) upon its binding to aggregated peptide species (45LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar, 46Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E.

A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Polymerization was initiated by the addition of 1–5 μl of 1 m NaCl to a solution containing 2.2 μm peptide and 10 μm ThS. Fluorescence was followed at 480 nm with excitation at 440 nm using 5 nm excitation and emission slit widths. All measurements were carried out at 21 °C with an LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a 75-μl quartz cell. Data points were collected at 1-s intervals over the course of the experiment (1200–7000 s). Apparent first-order rate constants were estimated by fitting the base-line corrected data to a single exponential, consistent with a seeded nucleation-elongation mechanism (45LeVine III, H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar, 46Friedhoff P. Schneider A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E.

A two-parameter fit was carried out by using Equation 1, It−I0If−I0=(1−e−k1t) (Eq. 1) where It and If are the fluorescence intensities at time t and at equilibrium; k1 is the apparent first-order rate constant. If and k1 were treated as adjustable parameters and fit to the first 2000 data points. X-ray Diffraction—The sample peptides were analyzed under different conditions: lyophilized, vapor-hydrated, and solubilized then dried. For the first condition, the lyophilized peptide was gently packed into a thin-walled siliconized glass capillary (0.7 mm diameter; Charles A. Supper Co., South Natick, MA) to form a disk. The vapor-hydrated sample was prepared by equilibrating lyophilized peptide against water vapor in a sealed capillary tube. For preparing solubilized/dried peptide assemblies, lyophilized peptide was dissolved at ∼5–10 mg/ml in water, loaded into capillary tubes, and then allowed gradually to dry at ambient temperature and humidity while in a 2-Tesla permanent magnet (Charles A. Supper Co.), which can promote fibril alignment by diamagnetic anisotropy of peptide bonds and aromatic groups (49Oldenbourgh R. Phillips W.C. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1986; 57: 2362-2365Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 50Makowski L. Sweet R.M. Woodhead A.D. Brookhaven Symposium: Synchrotron Radiation in Biology. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 341-347Google Scholar). After the peptide solution dried to a small, uniform disk, the capillary tube was removed from the magnetic field and transferred to the sample holder for x-ray diffraction. The x-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by using nickel-filtered, double-mirror focused CuKα radiation from an Elliott GX20 rotating anode x-ray generator (GEC Avionics, Hertfordshire, UK) with a 200-μm focal spot, operated at 35 kV and 35 mA. A helium tunnel was placed in the x-ray path to reduce air scatter. Patterns were recorded on DEF films (Eastman Kodak). The known Bragg spacing of calcite (3.035 Å) was used to calibrate the specimen-to-film distance (87.4 mm). The Bragg spacings of reflections were measured directly from the film or from densitometer tracings of the x-ray films. Tau-related Peptides Used in This Study—The peptides studied were analogs of PHF6 (VQIVYK), a peptide homologous to a segment within the third MTBR of tau (30von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). PHF6-related hexapeptides having single amino acid substitutions (Ile → Val, Tyr → Ala, and Gln → Val) and N-terminal truncated analogs were prepared in order to study the filament-forming potential of these related structures. Because charge distribution has been shown to have a profound effect on the propensity of peptides to aggregate into filaments (51Lopez de la Paz M. Goldie K. Zurdo J. Lacroix E. Dobson C.M. Hoenger A. Serrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16052-16057Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 52Caplan M.R. Schwartzfarb E.M. Zhang S. Kamm R.D. Lauffenburger D.A. Biomaterials. 2002; 23: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the peptides studied were prepared as N-acetylated peptide amides. In the absence of N- and C-terminal charges, the blocked peptides closely mimic peptide segments within the protein structure. Primary structures and molecular weights of peptides used are shown in Table I. Aggregation Kinetics—AcPHF6KE, an analog of AcPHF6 with its positively charged C-terminal lysine replaced by a negatively charged glutamate, spontaneously formed a gel in distilled water or in the presence of strong hydrogen bond-breaking solvents (i.e. 99% formic acid or HFIP). All other N-acetylated peptide amides studied appeared soluble in distilled water but rapidly formed viscous solutions following the addition of NaCl. We used the change in fluorescence upon binding of ThS to monitor the polymerization of peptide initiated by the addition of NaCl to the buffered medium. Under these conditions unblocked PHF6 showed no aggregation within the experimental time frame. Initial polymerization kinetics for the remaining acetylated peptide amides (as shown in Fig. 1A) followed a single-exponential approach to equilibrium, consistent with a seeded nucleation-elongation mechanism (48Inouye H. Kirschner D.A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar kinetic behavior has been observed for polymerization of short amyloidogenic peptides and for heparin or arachidonic acid-catalyzed polymerization of tau constructs at high protein concentrations (18Abraha A.

At later times there was a deviation from single-exponential kinetic behavior for AcPHF4, likely as a result of the formation of higher order aggregates, and AcPHF6IV continued to show an increase in fluorescence, in a manner similar to that observed previously for transthyretin polymerization (56MacPhee C.E. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1203-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Apparent first-order rate constants are summarized in Table II. The results show that AcPHF6 had the most rapid aggregation rate and that the rate was decreased by N-terminal truncation. A plot of the logarithm of the apparent first-order rate constant as a function of the number of residues in the peptide (Fig. 1B) yielded a linear relationship (r2 = 0.93). Changing Ile → Val or Gln → Val in the AcPHF6 sequence decreased the polymerization rate nearly 3-fold in comparison to AcPHF6, whereas changing Tyr → Ala decreased the rate nearly 10-fold.Table IIParameters obtained from best fit of kinetic dataPeptideIf - Iok1 × 103 s-1AcPHF615.96 (±0.04)8.54 (±0.07)AcPHF546.39 (±0.05)3.19 (±0.02)AcPHF47.46 (±0.03)2.64 (±0.02)AcVYK2.29 (±0.05)0.34 (±0.01)AcYK0.99 (±0.02)0.31 (±0.01)PHF6IV31.80 (±0.03)2.34 (±0.01)PHF6YA25.44 (±0.02)0.86 (±0.01)PHF6QV4.17 (±0.02)2.95 (±0.02) Open table in a new tab CD of Tau-related Peptides—Fig. 2 shows the CD spectra of tau-related peptides in 5 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.2. The CD spectra displayed by these peptides were of three types. Type A spectra, which had an intense negative band between 195 and 200 nm and a weak negative shoulder near 220 nm, are typical of proteins with a high fraction of random coil or polyproline II structure or of some βII proteins having a high fraction of truncated or twisted β-sheet structure (57Woody R.W.

Their analysis suggests that the maintenance of the balance between stability and flexibility is crucial for proteins to function at their environmental temperatures, and it is achieved by the modification of intramolecular interactions in the process of temperature adaptation. There has recently been an increase in the discovery, isolation, and investigation of organisms inhabiting extreme environments (extremophiles) (1Rothschild L.J. Mancinelli R.L. Nature. 2001; 409: 1092-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Among these, organisms living at low and high temperatures (psychrophiles and thermophiles, respectively) have been of particular interest since proteins isolated from these organisms can function and remain stable at or near extreme temperatures (2Deming J.W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Jaenicke R. Böhm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). These proteins have potential in industry directly or as models for engineering proteins from organisms living at moderate temperatures (mesophiles) because their unique properties such as activity at extreme temperatures and inactivity or instability at moderate temperatures are often desirable for industrial processes (4Demirjian D.C. Moris-Varas F. Cassidy C.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5Bruins M.E. Janssen A.E. Boom R.M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2001; 90: 155-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). They have also drawn attention from academia because they provide a unique opportunity to study relationships between stability, dynamics, and function of proteins (6D'Amico S. Marx J.C. Gerday C. Feller G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7891-7896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 7Lonhienne T. Gerday C. Feller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Therefore, research efforts have focused on comparative studies using proteins from temperature extremophiles and their mesophilic counterparts to illustrate a mechanism for temperature adaptation of proteins. Because of the relative ease of crystallizing thermophilic proteins, many structural studies have been performed to identify the molecular basis of heat adaptation by comparing thermophilic proteins with their mesophilic homologs. Several unique structural features in thermophilic proteins have been observed (8Szilágy A. Závodszky P. Structure. 2000; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The modification of subtle intramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonding (9Tanner J.J. Hecht R.M. Krause K.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2597-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), electrostatic interactions of ion pairs (10Perl D. Mueller U. Heinemann U. Schmid F.X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and hydrophobic interactions (11Criswell A.R. Bae E. Stec B. Konisky J. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 1087-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was proposed to be responsible for the increased thermal stability. On the other hand, the molecular mechanism of cold adaptation in psychrophilic proteins is still relatively unknown due to the limited number of available structures. In fact, only a handful of crystal structures have been solved for psychrophilic proteins presumably because their thermolability and flexibility cause difficulties in handling and crystallizing (12Russell N.J. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, a general feature of cold adaptation has begun to appear. Almost all the psychrophilic protein structures seem to contain fewer intramolecular interactions of the type involved in stabilization of thermophilic proteins at high temperatures (13Aghajari N. Feller G. Gerday C. Haser R. Structure. 1998; 6: 1503-1516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Kim S.Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim S.H. Sung H.C. Han Y.S. Cho Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7531-7539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Each protein uses different specific structural strategies for cold adaptation (16Gianese G. Bossa F. Pascarella S. Proteins. 2002; 47: 236-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is understood in terms of maintaining appropriate flexibility to ensure physiological activity at different temperatures (17D'Amico S. Claverie P. Collins T. Georlette D. Gratia E. Hoyoux A. Meuwis M.A. Feller G. Gerday C. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Fields P.A. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 129: 417-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is that directed thermal motion is needed for catalysis, and thus, psychrophilic enzymes have to increase their flexibility at low temperatures by decreasing stability. According to this hypothesis, mesophilic enzymes essentially become too inflexible to perform a catalytic cycle at low temperatures, and the same phenomenon happens even at moderate temperatures for thermophilic enzymes. Despite a growing abundance of comparative studies on temperature adaptation of proteins, most have been criticized because the proteins compared are often from distantly related organisms (19Sheridan P.P. Panasik N. Coombs J.M. Brenchley J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1543: 417-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These organisms probably experienced different evolutionary pressures that may or may not be related to temperature adaptation. Differences between protein structures may result from other sources than environmental temperatures. To minimize the phylogenetic noise, it is desirable to compare proteins from organisms that are closely related but inhabit different temperatures. In this work we use adenylate kinases from the psychrophile Bacillus globisporus (AKglo) 1The abbreviations used are: AKglo, adenylate kinase from B. globisporus; AKsub, adenylate kinase from B. subtilis; AKste, adenylate kinase from B. stearothermophilus; AK, adenylate kinase; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Tm, thermal denaturation midpoint; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AKglo, adenylate kinase from B. globisporus; AKsub, adenylate kinase from B. subtilis; AKste, adenylate kinase from B. stearothermophilus; AK, adenylate kinase; Ap5A, P1,P5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; Tm, thermal denaturation midpoint; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)-ethanesulfonic acid.

Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. 2. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1986: 1105-1139Google Scholar). They come from organisms in the same genus and exhibit a high level of similarity to ensure conservation of the structural features responsible for temperature adaptation. Adenylate kinase (AK), originally named myokinase because of its discovery in muscle, has been well studied over several decades (24Noda L. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, Inc., New York1973: 279-305Google Scholar). It undergoes substantial dynamic events during a catalytic cycle (25Vonrhein C. Schlauderer G. Schulz G.E.

It has a LID domain that closes over the site of phosphoryl transfer and an AMP binding domain that closes on AMP when it is bound. Structures have been solved of various states of the enzyme from various species (11Criswell A.R. Bae E. Stec B. Konisky J. Phillips Jr., G.N. J. Mol.

By having a set of three highly dynamic targets with high sequence identity (about 70%) and differing temperature/activity and stability profiles we feel we have a special opportunity to explore the structure/dynamics/function relationships involved in the temperature adaptation of proteins. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—AKglo and AKsub were commercially cloned by ATG Laboratories. To clone the unknown AKglo gene, 5′ and internal primers were designed based on other Bacillus AK sequences and the AKglo partial amino acid sequence provided by Dr. A.-M. Gilles and Dr. O. Bârzu. Amplification with these primers produced the 5′ end fragment. The sequence of the 3′ end of the gene was obtained using the inverse PCR strategy. The final sequence was confirmed by cloning and sequencing the full-length AKglo. The AKsub gene was cloned based on the known sequence. These genes were subcloned into Escherichia coli expression vectors, which were subsequently transformed into E. coli expression strain BL21[DE3]. The E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.7. Protein expression was then induced for 6 h by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm (final concentration). The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and lysed mechanically. The cell lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected for purification. The proteins were purified at room temperature by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. After applying the crude extract to a column containing Bio-Rad Affi-Gel blue resin and washing with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2), absorbed proteins were eluted by using a NaCl step gradient. The pooled fractions containing the enzymes were concentrated and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration column from Amersham Biosciences. The fractions were collected by monitoring UV absorbance at 280 nm and were dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and concentrated for crystallization. The proteins were judged to be pure by SDS-PAGE, and their concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm. AKste was purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—To study thermal stability of AKs and their complexes with inhibitor Ap5A, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a MicroCal MCS DSC instrument at a scanning rate of 1 °C/min. The samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and diluted with the buffer so that protein concentration in the sample would be 1 mg/ml. Buffer-buffer scans were also performed and subtracted from sample-buffer scans to minimize the background noise. Data were analyzed using MicroCal Origin provided by MicroCal. Activity Assays—The enzyme activity of AKs was determined at various temperatures in the direction of ATP formation by an end-point method. AK (0.0001 mg/ml final concentration) was added to a 1-ml mixture containing 1 mm glucose, 0.4 mm NADP+, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). This assay solution was incubated at the desired temperature for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding ADP (2.5 mm final concentration). The reaction was allowed to proceed at the same temperature for 3 min and then stopped by adding Ap5A (1 mm final concentration) and cooling on ice for 2 min. The amount of ATP produced by AK was determined using the ATP-dependent reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. After adding 10 units of hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the reaction was allowed to complete at room temperature for 10 min, and then absorbance at 340 nm was measured. The experiments were repeated several times at each temperature. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of AKglo were grown by the small scale batch method (31Rayment I. Structure (Camb). 2002; 10: 147-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) by mixing 4 μl of 20 mg/ml AKglo, 5 mm Ap5A with 6 μl of 2.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, 50mm Hepes (pH 7.0). Crystals with hexagonal rod shape were grown to 0.5 mm long with a 0.04-mm edge of hexagon in 3 weeks at 20 °C. AKglo crystals were equilibrated for 30 s in 23% (v/v) glycerol, 2.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3, 50mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and then flash-frozen by transferring into cold liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data for AKglo were collected on a MARCCD-165 detector at the BioCARS 14-ID-B beamline of the Advanced Photon Source. Crystals of AKsub were grown by the hanging-drop method. The drops were made by mixing 6 μl of 18 mg/ml AKsub and 3.5 mm Ap5A with 6 μl of the crystallization solution containing 35% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500, 50 mm CaCl2, 50 mm CHES (pH 9.0). Crystals with rectangular block shape grew to dimensions of 0.1 × 0.05 × 0.05 mm in 5 days at 20 °C. AKsub crystals were flash-frozen in a cold liquid nitrogen stream directly from the drops without any cryoprotectant. Diffraction data for AKsub were collected on an ADSC Q-4 detector at the BioCARS 14-BM-D beamline of the Advanced Photon Source. Data Processing, Molecular Replacement, and Refinement—The data for AKglo and AKsub were processed with the HKL program package (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar). A molecular replacement solution for AKsub was found using SOMoRe (33Jamrog D.C. Zhang Y. Phillips Jr., G.N.

After refinement steps, the new AKsub model was used to solve the AKglo structure by molecular replacement. Both AK structures were refined with CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar) and XtalView (35McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). The refinement with cycles of energy minimization, temperature factor fitting, manual rebuilding, and solvent addition continued until no improvement was observed in R and Rfree. No restraints were used between metal ions and their coordinated atoms in the refinement. Structure Analysis—Structure quality was evaluated using PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Structure superposition was performed with Sequoia (37Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderström M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Two oppositely charged residues were identified as an ion pair if their closest oppositely charged atoms were within 4 Å. The carboxylic oxygen atoms of Asp, Glu, and the C-terminal residue were considered as negatively charged atoms, and the amino nitrogen atoms of Arg, Lys, His, and the N-terminal residue were considered as positively charged atoms. Hydrogen bonds were defined by using HB2 options in WHAT IF (38Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3363) Google Scholar). In the HB2 options the total hydrogen bonding energy is optimized to find the best positions for all hydrogen atoms simultaneously, and hydrogen bonds are determined from the donor/acceptor types, the H-acceptor distance, the donor-H-acceptor angle, and the position of the hydrogen with respect to the acceptor. Polar and apolar-exposed and buried surface areas were calculated with WHAT IF using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms were considered polar, and carbon and sulfur atoms were considered apolar. All properties were analyzed for residues 1–212 and averaged over multiple conformations. Among three structures of AKste, the Mg2+Ap5A-bound form (PDB entry 1ZIO) was used for analysis. All figures with molecular structures have been generated using RIBBONS (39Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Sequence Comparison—Newly sequenced AKglo has been aligned with AKsub and AKste in Fig. 1. They have the same number of amino acids and could be aligned without any gap. As expected, they share high amino acid sequence identity; 67% for AKglo and AKsub, 74% for AKsub and AKste, and 66% for AKste and AKglo. The N-terminal region is well conserved, including the completely conserved P-loop region (residues 7–15), whereas the C-terminal region is the most variable. As in other AKs from Gram-positive bacteria, AKglo contains the sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X16-Cys-X2-Cys/Asp, which is involved in zinc coordination (20Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Perrier V. Meier A. Longin R. Sebald M. Maignan L. Pistotnik E. Barzu O. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 520-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AKglo has Asp-153 at the last position of the motif identical to AKsub. Thermal Stability and Temperature Optimum—Thermal denaturation midpoints (Tm) of AKglo, AKsub, and their Ap5A complexes were determined by DSC experiments (Table I). The scans were performed from 5 to 85 °C. The resulting data clearly showed a single peak for each scan and, therefore, can be well approximated by a two-state transition model. The Tm of AKsub (47.6 °C) is similar to the previously reported value (50.7 °C) considering that different conditions were used for DSC in the previous study (21Perrier V. Surewicz W.K. Glaser P. Martineau L. Craescu C.T. Fabian H. Mantsch H.H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9960-9967Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Ap5A complexes of AKglo and AKsub have higher Tm values than the free AKs, but the Tm difference between AKglo and AKsub is maintained between AKglo·Ap5A and AKsub·Ap5A complexes. No attempt to measure Tm values for AKste and the AKste·Ap5A complex was made because in preliminary temperature scans they started to precipitate at about 60 and 80 °C, respectively. This does not mean that they are not stable below the temperatures where precipitation takes place. To show stability of AKste and the AKste·Ap5A complex before precipitation, temperature scans for the DSC experiments were performed to 55 and 70 °C, respectively, and no signal for transition was observed. Considering this observation and the previously reported Tm for AKste of 74.5 °C (22Glaser P. Presecan E. Delepierre M. Surewicz W.K. Mantsch H.H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3038-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it would be reasonable to assume that Tm values of AKste and its Ap5A complex are at least higher than 55 and 70 °C, respectively, indicating that AKste is the most stable among the three AKs, and the AKste·Ap5A complex is more stable than the AKglo·Ap5A and AKsub·Ap5A complexes.Table IThermal denaturation midpoint (Tm) of Bacillus AKsEnzymeTmTm of Ap5A complex°C°CAKglo43.360.4AKsub47.666.0AKsteaTemperature scans for AKste and AKste·Ap5A complex were ended at 55 and 70 °C, respectively, and no signal for transition was observed.>55.0>70.0a Temperature scans for AKste and AKste·Ap5A complex were ended at 55 and 70 °C, respectively, and no signal for transition was observed. Open table in a new tab AKglo, AKsub, and AKste have disparate optimal temperatures for their AK activity, which reflect temperature optima of their psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic source organisms (Fig. 2). The three temperature profiles have similar shapes and could be overlapped by shifting toward high or low temperatures, indicating temperature adaptation. Psychrophilic AKglo showed the lowest temperature optimum as well as higher relative activity at lower temperatures than AKsub and AKste. Thermophilic AKste displayed its maximum activity at high temperatures, where AKglo and AKsub are completely inactive. In the assays, altering the preheating time before starting the reactions caused changes in the temperature optimum (data not shown). Longer incubation of AKs resulted in shifting of the temperature profiles toward low temperatures, indicating that at temperatures even below their denaturation temperatures (Tm values), long exposure of AKs to heat caused continuous gradual denaturation. However, the ordering in temperature optima of AKglo, AKsub, and AKste was always observed with different preheating times. Therefore, the data presented here, which were obtained with 10-min preheating times should be interpreted to illustrate different relative temperature-activity profiles of the three AKs rather than used to give a specific optimal temperature for each AK. Structure Overview—The crystal structures of AKglo and AKsub were solved to resolutions of 2.25 and 1.90 Å, respectively. A summary of data collection and refinement statistics is presented in Table II. Both AKs were crystallized with a bound inhibitor, Ap5A, in their active sites. Residues 213–217 of AKsub are missing from the model due to disorder of the C terminus, whereas the AKglo model contains all 217 residues. Ramachandran plots indicate that for AKglo and AKsub, 90.8 and 92.7% of non-Gly and non-Pro residues fall in the most favored regions, and 9.2 and 7.3% fall in the allowed regions, respectively.Table IICrystallographic data statisticsAKgloaValues in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.AKsubaValues in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.AKstebRef. 29.Space groupP3121P21P21Cell constants65.3 Å × 65.3 Å × 94.4 Å32.8 Å × 73.2 Å × 38.1 Å, β = 101.6°41.2 Å × 62.3 Å × 42.1 Å, β = 117.1°Resolution (Å)2.25 (2.33-2.25)1.90 (1.97-1.90)1.96Unique reflections11,384 (1112)13,641 (1084)12,454Completeness (%)99.2 (99.4)96.8 (76.3)93.1Rmerge (%)5.7 (59.3)5.0 (16.6)10.6R (%)22.319.716.1Rfree (%)28.824.622.8r.m.s.d.cRoot mean square deviation. from idealityBonds (Å)0.0170.0210.012Angles (°)1.21.22.0Average B-factors (Å2)Main chaindCalculated for residues 1-212.49.527.710.9Side chaindCalculated for residues 1-212.53.036.219.4Solvent49.837.528.0Ap5A37.721.38.7Wilson plot B-factors (Å2)32.619.28.0a Values in parentheses represent the highest resolution shell.b Ref. 29Berry M.B.

Open table in a new tab The chain folds of AKglo and AKsub are essentially identical to those of other AKs. Both structures are composed of a central β-sheet and surrounding α-helices and possess the three characteristic AK domains CORE (residues 1–30, 60–127, and 160–217), AMP binding (residues 31–59), and LID (residues 128–159). The structures of the three Bacillus AKs are very similar except for the position of the LID domain (Fig. 3). AKglo and AKsub have their LID domains fully closed, but AKste has a partially opened LID domain, which was previously attributed to packing contacts within the AKste crystal (29Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 275-288Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Alignments of the three LID domains confirm that the LID domain of AKste has moved as a rigid body (Table III).Table IIIRoot mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values for Cα atoms between Bacillus AKsDomains aligned (residues)Structures comparedr.m.s.d.Residues not structurally equivalentaDefined by the program Sequoia with the default distance cutoff (4.5 Å).ÅAKglo-AKsub0.73NoneAll (1-212)AKglo-AKste1.65132-135, 145-155AKsub-AKste1.76132-135, 145-155AKglo-AKsub0.40NoneLID (128-159)AKglo-AKste0.43NoneAKsub-AKste0.40NoneAKglo-AKsub0.63NoneCORE and AMP-binding (1-127, 160-212)AKglo-AKste0.61NoneAKsub-AKste0.66Nonea Defined by the program Sequoia with the default distance cutoff (4.5 Å). Open table in a new tab AKglo and AKsub were known to have a Zn2+ atom in their LID domains (20Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Perrier V. Meier A. Longin R. Sebald M. Maignan L. Pistotnik E. Barzu O. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 520-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both AKglo and AKsub, the bound Zn2+ atom is very obvious in the LID domain and is coordinated to Cys-130, Cys-133, Cys-150, and Asp-153 (Fig. 4), whereas in AKste the zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to four Cys residues. They are the first protein structures to show zinc coordinated by three Cys and one Asp/Glu. The carboxylate of Asp-153 in both AKglo and AKsub shows bidentate coordination to the Zn2+ atom, and one of the connections between the Zn2+ and the carboxylic oxygens is longer than the other, as is usually found in bidentate arrangements within zinc binding sites in protein and small molecule structures (40Alberts I.L. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Ap5A binding in both AKglo and AKsub exhibits the same general conformation as in AKste. The bound Ap5A occupies both ATP/ADP and AMP/ADP sites, and the side chains interacting with Ap5A are essentially the same in all three AKs. The AKglo structure does not have Mg2+ with the bound Ap5A, as is the case with other AK structures crystallized in ammonium sulfate solution (28Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 29Berry M.B. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 32: 275-288Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but does not display alternative conformations of the δ phosphate seen in other structures having Ap5A without bound Mg2+. The AKsub structure has Mg2+ with Ap5A and demonstrates hexagonal coordination with two phosphate oxygens in Ap5A and four water molecules as in the AKste structure. Comparison of Structural Features—To reveal a molecular basis of low and high temperature adaptation, several structural features were compared between the three AK structures (Table IV). Ion pairs were identified using a distance cutoff of 4 Å. The thermophilic AKste has the most ion pairs among all three AKs, whereas the mesophilic AKsub has one less ion pair than the psychrophilic AKglo, which makes sense considering that ion pairs contribute to protein stability mostly at elevated temperatures (41Elcock A.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To make a more precise comparison of ion pairs rather than just counting the numb"
https://openalex.org/W2141321445,"One of the major physiological roles of potassium channels in glial cells is to promote “potassium spatial buffering” in the central nervous system, a process necessary to maintain an optimal potassium concentration in the extracellular environment. This process requires the precise distribution of potassium channels accumulated at high density in discrete subdomains of glial cell membranes. To obtain a better understanding of how glial cells selectively target potassium channels to discrete membrane subdomains, we addressed the question of whether the glial inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 associates with the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC). Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Kir4.1 is associated with the DGC in mouse brain and cultured cortical astrocytes. In vitro immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays demonstrated that Kir4.1 can bind directly to α-syntrophin, requiring the presence of the last three amino acids of the channel (SNV), a consensus PDZ domain-binding motif. Furthermore, Kir4.1 failed to associate with the DGC in brains from α-syntrophin knockout mice. These results suggest that Kir4.1 is localized in glial cells by its association with the DGC through a PDZ domain-mediated interaction with α-syntrophin and suggest an important role for the DGC in central nervous system physiology.

The inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 is a tetrameric transmembrane protein expressed in the central nervous system. Within the central nervous system, this channel is found primarily in glial cells, including astrocytes within the brain (1Poopalasundaram S. Knott C. Shamotienko O.G. Foran P.G. Dolly J.O. Ghiani C.A. Gallo V. Wilkin G.P. Glia. 2000; 30: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and Müller cells of the retina (2Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glial Kir channels are involved in the process known as potassium spatial buffering, which helps to regulate the extracellular K+ concentration. This process ensues when K+ released from neurons is absorbed from the extracellular space by glial cells and redistributed to areas where the extracellular K+ concentration is low (3Amédéé T. Robert A. Coles J.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 4Kofuji P. Connors N.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2003; 28: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Kir4.1 channels are highly enriched in astrocytic processes that surround blood vessels (5Higashi K. Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C922-C931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in the end-feet and perivascular processes in Müller cells (6Kofuji P. Ceelen P. Zahs K.R. Surbeck L.W. Lester H.A. Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5733-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that this unique distribution within glial cells helps to facilitate the potassium buffering process by producing subcellular domains of high K+ conductance (7Odette L.L.

The subcellular distribution of proteins such as Kir4.1 in glial cells implies an underlying mechanism for these discrete localization patterns. One possible mechanism includes the binding to proteins that contain PDZ (PSD-95/Discs large/ZO-1) domains. These domains are responsible for a wide array of protein-protein interactions in the central nervous system and elsewhere (11Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Kir4.1 harbors a consensus type I PDZ domain-binding region at its C terminus, and in vitro studies have shown that Kir4.1 can interact with proteins that possess these domains (12Horio Y. Hibino H.

One specific group of proteins shown to include this motif are the syntrophins, which are found as part of a multiprotein complex known as the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) (13Adams M.E.

The DGC is a membrane-spanning group of proteins (14Michele D.E. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

A notable proportion of muscular dystrophy patients exhibit non-progressive cognitive deficits, suggesting a link between the DGC and brain function (18Anderson J.L. Head S.I. Rae C. Morley J.W.

Recent evidence also suggests that the DGC confers subcellular clustering and localization of signaling molecules and transmembrane proteins in the brain (30Hashida-Okumura A. Okumura N. Iwamatsu A.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the preceding evidence, we hypothesized that Kir4.1 is associated with the DGC in brain and astrocytes. Moreover, we propose that the interaction between Kir4.1 and the DGC may be mediated by a direct PDZ domain-dependent interaction with α-syntrophin. Based on our results and other recent data, we propose a model in which Kir4.1 and AQP4 may be co-associated via their respective interactions with the DGC. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Kir4.1 were as characterized and described previously (6Kofuji P. Ceelen P. Zahs K.R. Surbeck L.W. Lester H.A. Newman E.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5733-5740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal antibodies against Kir4.1 were generated against the peptide sequence CLREQAEKEGSALSVRISNV by Bethyl Laboratories, Inc. (Montgomery, TX). Guinea pig anti-α-syntrophin antibodies were generated against the peptide sequence CRQPSSPGPQPRNLSEA by Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO). Rabbit anti-α-syntrophin polyclonal antibody was obtained from Sigma. Mouse anti-β-dystroglycan monoclonal antibody (clone 43DAG1/8D5) was from Novacastra (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). Rabbit polyclonal antibody HA.11 was obtained from Babco (Richmond, CA). Mouse anti-dystrophin C terminus monoclonal antibody (clone 6C5) and mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein monoclonal antibody (clone GA5) were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10) was obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-guinea pig, or anti-goat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). Cell Cultures—Mouse cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (33McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3398) Google Scholar). Astrocytes were allowed to grow in culture for 2 weeks, during which time they were split twice. Cells were grown to confluence prior to use in biochemical experiments. These cells were verified to be astrocytes by immunostaining with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein, which revealed positive staining in >95% of all cells. COS-7 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cross-linking and Lysis—Cross-linking solution was prepared by first dissolving 2 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce) in Me2SO, which was then added at a 10-fold dilution (final [DSP] = 200 μm) to buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 7.5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). For astrocyte cultures, plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in cross-linking solution with gentle agitation for 30 min at room temperature. The cross-linking reaction was then quenched by the addition of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °Cin500 μl of lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm EGTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100 plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were spun at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were recovered and utilized immediately. Brain tissue lysates were prepared from adult C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) or from α-syntrophin null mice as described previously (5Higashi K. Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C922-C931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were killed, and brains were removed and homogenized using a mechanical tissue homogenizer in buffer consisting of 250 mm sucrose, 7.5 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenate was then supplemented with 200 μm DSP predissolved in Me2SO and agitated at room temperature for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) for 15 min, and proteins were extracted by the addition of 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 under gentle agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were then spun at top speed in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants collected and spun again. The final supernatant was collected and used immediately. For COS-7 cells, 24 h after transfection, each plate was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Lysates were then centrifuged at 1000 × g, and supernatants were collected and utilized immediately. It should be noted that the cross-linking reagent was not used for co-immunoprecipitations in COS-7 cells or for any of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays. Immunoprecipitation—Mouse brain lysates were precleared of immunoglobulin by incubation for 1–3 h at 4 °C with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), which were then removed by centrifugation. Brain and cell lysates were incubated with 1–15 μg of the pull-down antibody overnight at 4 °C on a mechanical rotator. Recombinant protein G- or A-Sepharose beads preblocked in 2% bovine serum albumin were then added for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and samples were subjected to gel electrophoresis and Western blotting either as described previously (21Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or using NuPAGE BisTris 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen), followed by subsequent transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Constructs—GST fusion constructs were engineered by PCR. Template DNA consisted of rat Kir4.1 cDNA in a pcDNA3.1 vector previously modified to contain an EcoRI restriction site immediately downstream of the stop codon. An internal PCR primer containing a 5′-EcoRI restriction site was synthesized and used concurrently with the bovine growth hormone pcDNA3.1 reverse primer to amplify a DNA fragment to encode the last 87 amino acids of the channel protein. For the truncation mutant (GST-Kir4.1Δ), prior to the PCR described above, a stop codon was introduced at Ser377 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting PCR products were digested with EcoRI and ligated to the pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). Myc-α-syntrophin was constructed using mouse α-syntrophin cDNA in pBluescript SK, which was digested with BssHII and SmaI to extract a fragment containing all except for the first five codons of the open reading frame. The resulting sticky ends were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase, and the fragment was ligated to the pCMV-Tag3B vector (Stratagene) predigested with EcoRV, resulting in a Myc tag at the N terminus of the protein. For the α-syn- construct, pCMV-Tag3B/Myc-α-syntrophin was used as a template for PCR using a forward primer complementary to a sequence immediately downstream of the α-syntrophin PDZ domain and tagged at the 5′-end with an Eco47III restriction site, used concurrently with a 3′-T7 primer. The resulting PCR fragment and full-length construct were digested with Eco47III and SmaI, and the PCR fragment was ligated to the vector. The resulting cDNA encoded a Myc-tagged α-syntrophin construct lacking the PDZ domain. Synthesis of GST Proteins—GST fusion constructs were transformed into BL21 Codon Plus-RP cells (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single colonies were used to inoculate 10 ml of 2XYT medium + 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight in a 37 °C shaking water bath. The next morning, 1 ml of the overnight culture was used to inoculate a fresh 100-ml culture of 2XYT medium + 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown to A600 = 0.7, and then 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. After 2 h, cultures were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and then sonicated for 4 × 15 s at 1-min intervals. The sonicates were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was added to 100 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Following incubation, the beads were washed extensively, aliquotted, and stored at -80 °C until needed. GST Pull-down Assay—Cell lysates were incubated in 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads previously conjugated to the GST fusion protein of interest. Samples were incubated on a mechanical rotator overnight at 4 °C. The next morning, the samples were washed extensively with lysis buffer, resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (21Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Brain-specific DGC Forms a Complex with Kir4.1—To date, the mechanisms that underlie the targeting and subcellular localization of Kir4.1 in astrocytes remain unknown. Our recent data showing the essential role of the short dystrophin isoform Dp71 in the localization of Kir4.1 channels in Müller cells of the retina (21Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest an interaction between these proteins in glial cells. To verify whether proteins of the DGC interact with Kir4.1, we performed a series of immunoprecipitation experiments using mouse brain lysates. The cross-linking reagent DSP has been previously used to stabilize interactions involving the DGC (23Neely J.D. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Ottersen O.P. Froehner S.C. Agre P. Adams M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14108-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 34Zhu T. Dahan D. Evagelidis A. Zheng S. Luo J. Hanrahan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29102-29107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and was used to stabilize protein-protein interactions in our studies (see “Materials and Methods”). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. We first asked whether the glial dystrophin isoform Dp71 and the Kir4.1 channel proteins co-associate in brain. We used rabbit polyclonal antibodies to immunoprecipitate Kir4.1 from brain and recovered the immunocomplexes with protein A-Sepharose beads, which were then used for Western blotting. Fig. 1A (IP:Kir4.1 lane) shows that we were able to detect a band at ∼71 kDa when we probed the resulting Western blot with anti-dystrophin antibodies. These data indicate that Kir4.1 channels and the dystrophin isoform Dp71 form a macromolecular complex in brain. Specificity of the immunoprecipitation was verified by running a mock immunoprecipitation lacking the anti-Kir4.1 antibody, which did not bring down the Dp71 protein (Fig. 1A, pA lane). We also tested the interactions of Kir4.1 channels with other components of the DGC, viz. α-syntrophin and β-dystroglycan. Within the DGC, α-syntrophin is localized to the intracellular compartment and binds directly to dystrophin (35Yang B. Jung D. Rafael J.A. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4975-4978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). When we performed immunoprecipitation assays with anti-α-syntrophin antibody and probed the precipitate for the presence of Kir4.1, we detected a band at ∼200 kDa, the expected size for the tetrameric form of Kir4.1 (Fig. 1B). Once again, our blotting antibody did not show a positive result when the pull-down antibody was excluded from the reaction. We next attempted to demonstrate an interaction between Kir4.1 and β-dystroglycan. This component of the DGC spans the cell membrane and binds directly to Dp71, but not to α-syntrophin (36Matsumura K. Ervasti J.M. Ohlendieck K. Kahl S.D. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 360: 588-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 37Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Upon immunoprecipitation with monoclonal antibodies against β-dystroglycan and subsequent probing for Kir4.1, we detected the expected band of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 1C). To verify the specificity of the coprecipitation, we performed the reciprocal experiments in which Kir4.1 and β-dystroglycan were coprecipitated using an antibody against Kir4.1 (Fig. 1D). In both experiments, the identified bands were quite faint, although there appears to be a band present in the immunoprecipitation lane (IP:Kir4.1 lane) that is not present in the protein A-Sepharose-only lane (pA lane), demonstrating the ability of Kir4.1 (Fig. 1C) and β-dystroglycan (Fig. 1D) to co-immunoprecipitate. A major concern in using cross-linking reagents is the chance that artifactual interactions are formed in the cross-linking reaction. When we tested for this possibility, we failed to detect interactions between Kir4.1 channels and other glial transmembrane proteins such as the gap junction protein connexin-43, as shown in Fig. 1E. The DGC in Cultured Cortical Astrocytes Forms a Complex with Kir4.1—To verify whether interaction between Kir4.1 and the DGC can occur specifically in astrocytes, we cultured cortical astrocytes from neonatal mice (postnatal days 1–3) and conducted a series of co-immunoprecipitation assays using these cells. Fig. 2A (IP:Kir4.1 lane) shows that when we immunoprecipitated Kir4.1 from cultured astrocytes, we detected a positive band at ∼71 kDa in the immunoprecipitated sample when probed with anti-dystrophin antibodies. This result indicates the macromolecular assembly of Dp71 and Kir4.1 channels in astrocytes. Interactions of Kir4.1 channels with other proteins of the DGC were also detected in this cell type. For example, when α-syntrophin was immunoprecipitated and the resulting Western blot was probed with anti-Kir4.1 antibodies, a positive band at ∼200 kDa was seen (Fig. 2B, IP:α-syn lane), indicating the recovery of Kir4.1 in the immunocomplex, and the same result was seen when we used anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, when Kir4.1 was immunoprecipitated from astrocytes, an immunopositive band of 43 kDa was revealed after probing the blot with anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies (Fig. 2D). Together, these results indicate that Kir4.1 interacts with the DGC components Dp71, α-syntrophin, and β-dystroglycan in astrocytes. Kir4.1 Associates with α-Syntrophin in a PDZ Domain-dependent Manner—Based on our data demonstrating that Kir4.1 can associate with proteins of the DGC, our next goal was to identify which of the DGC components can directly associate with the channel. Because α-syntrophin harbors a type I PDZ domain and because the C-terminal sequence of Kir4.1 (-SNV-COOH) has a consensus motif for binding to this domain, we sought to determine whether these proteins can directly associate by this mechanism. To this end, three approaches were used. First, we performed a pull-down assay using fusion proteins of GST and the C terminus of Kir4.1 incubated with lysates from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Myc-α-syntrophin. The results from this experiment revealed an anti-c-Myc immunoreactive band when lysates were incubated in the presence of the recombinant GST-Kir4.1 protein, but not with GST alone or recombinant GST-Kir4.1Δ, which lacks the extreme C terminus of the channel (Fig. 3, upper panel). Second, we performed an in vitro binding assay using the same immobilized fusion proteins incubated with lysates from either whole brain or astrocyte cultures as sources for α-syntrophin. The results in both circumstances were similar and are summarized in Fig. 3, confirming direct in vitro PDZ domain-dependent binding between Kir4.1 and α-syntrophin. The latter interactions were also confirmed to be highly specific, as recombinant GST-Kir4.1Δ or GST alone failed to bring down the endogenous α-syntrophin. Third, we performed immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells transfected with Kir4.1 and α-syntrophin cDNAs to show that these proteins can interact in situ. In our first experiment using this approach, Myc-α-syntrophin was cotransfected with either hemagglutinin (HA)-Kir4.1 or HA-Kir4.1Δ in COS-7 cells, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies. When these samples were then probed with anti-Myc antibodies, an immunopositive band at ∼60 kDa, corresponding to Myc-α-syntrophin, was present in cells cotransfected with HA-Kir4.1, but not with HA-Kir4.1Δ (Fig. 4A). We then cotransfected HA-Kir4.1 with either full-length Myc-α-syntrophin or a truncated version lacking the PDZ domain (Myc-α-syn-). When HA-Kir4.1 was immunoprecipitated, we were able to recover the full-length Myc-α-syntrophin in the precipitated complex, and although we were also able to detect the Myc-α-syn- construct, it was to a drastically reduced degree (Fig. 4B). Together, these results indicate that Kir4.1 is able to bind directly to α-syntrophin and that this interaction is PDZ domain-dependent.Fig. 4Kir4.1 and α-syntrophin interact in a PDZ domain-dependent manner in situ.A, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with Myc-α-syntrophin (α-syn) and either full-length HA-Kir4.1 or a truncated version lacking the last three amino acids (HA-Kir4.1Δ). After protein expression, the cells were lysed and incubated with antibodies against HA. Recovered complexes were processed by Western blotting and probed with anti-c-Myc antibody. The first two lanes were loaded with lysates from Myc-α-syntrophin/HA-Kir4.1 or Myc-α-syntrophin/HA-Kir4.1Δ, as indicated, to demonstrate that Myc-α-syntrophin was expressed under both conditions. The last two lanes show that when samples were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-HA antibody, the lysates expressing full-length HA-Kir4.1 resulted in the recovery of Myc-α-syntrophin, whereas the lysates expressing HA-Kir4.1Δ did not. When Myc-α-syntrophin/HA-Kir4.1-expressing cells were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads only (pG; third lane), Myc-α-syntrophin was not recovered. B, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with HA-Kir4.1 and either full-length Myc-α-syntrophin (α-syn) or a Myc-α-syntrophin construct from which the PDZ domain had been removed (α-syn-). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and recovered with protein G-Sepharose, and the Western blot was probed for c-Myc. The first two lanes show that when lysates from each of these conditions were directly loaded onto the gel, they both expressed their respective Myc-α-syntrophin constructs; the full-length construct migrated at 59 kDa, whereas the removal of the PDZ domain is reflected by a lower molecular mass band (second lane). The fourth lane shows that when a sample cotransfected with HA-Kir4.1 and Myc-α-syntrophin was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, Myc-α-syntrophin was recovered. The fifth lane shows that when the immunoprecipitati"

Mammalian telomere length is regulated by a number of proteins including human repressor activator protein (hRap1), a known association factor of TRF2. To further delineate hRap1 function and its associated proteins, we affinity-purified and identified the hRap1 protein complex through mass spectrometry analysis. In addition to TRF2, we found DNA repair proteins Rad50, Mre11, PARP1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase), and Ku86/Ku70 to be in this telomeric complex. We demonstrated by deletional analysis that Rad-50/Mre-11 and Ku86 were recruited to hRap1 independent of TRF2. PARP1, however, most likely interacted with hRap1 through TRF2. Interestingly, knockdown of endogenous hRap1 expression by small hairpin interference RNA resulted in longer telomeres. In addition, overexpression of full-length and mutant hRap1 that lacked the BRCA1 C-terminal domain functioned as dominant negatives and extended telomeres. Deletion of a novel linker domain of hRap1 (residues 199–223), however, abolished the dominant negative effect of hRap1 overexpression. These results indicate that hRap1 negatively regulates telomere length in vivo and suggest that the linker region of hRap1 may modulate the recruitment of negative regulators of telomere length.

In yeast, RAP1 is a negative regulator of telomere length as well as a regulator of transcription (for review, see Refs. 8Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H.

De Lange T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5060-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has yet to be fully determined, however, whether endogenous hRap1 is a negative or positive regulator of telomere length. scRAP1 contains two Myb domains and binds telomeric DNA (18Konig P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D. Cell. 1996; 85: 125-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19Longtine M.S. Wilson N.M. Petracek M.E. Berman J. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 225-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). scRAP1 has been shown to recruit Rif1, Rif2, and Sir proteins to regulate telomere length, structure, and transcriptional silencing (11Grunstein M.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Whether similar proteins, as found with yeast RAP1, are complexed with hRap1 remains unknown. In contrast, spRAP1 has only one Myb domain and is recruited to telomeres through Taz1, a yeast homologue of TRF2 (15Kanoh J. Ishikawa F. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1624-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Similar to spRAP1, hRap1 also contains a single Myb domain without detectable DNA binding activity (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 21Hanaoka S. Nagadoi A. Yoshimura S. Aimoto S. Li B. de Lange T. Nishimura Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to the Myb domain, hRap1 has three putative protein-protein interaction domains; they are a BRCT domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a TRF2 interacting RCT domain (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The function of the hRap1 BRCT and coiled-coil domains has yet to be described. TRF2 has been shown to associate with the MRN complex (Rad-50, Mre-11, and NBS1) (22Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the MRX complex (equivalent of MRN in mammals) has exonuclease activity, is a positive regulator of telomeres, and is responsible for telomere end processing (23Trujillo K.M. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35458-35464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Curr.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although both scRAP1 and the MRX complex localize to the telomere, the MRX complex does so independent of scRap1 (24Diede S.J. Gottschling D.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1336-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 25Tsukamoto Y. Taggart A.K. Zakian V.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1328-1335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is possible that hRap1 may interact with the mammalian MRN components, and this association may be necessary for telomere length control. Alternatively, hRap1 and TRF2 may recruit proteins other than the MRN complex to modulate telomere length. To address these questions, we undertook biochemical approaches to isolate and study protein complexes that are involved in telomere maintenance. We found several DNA repair proteins in addition to TRF2 to be in the hRap1 complex through affinity purification experiments. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of hRap1 via RNA interference (26Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar, 27Tuschl T. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and deletion experiments suggest that hRap1 negatively modulates telomere length in vivo and that multiple proteins may be required for hRap1 function. Generation of Constructs and Cell Lines of hRap1 and Its Deletion Mutants—Full-length hRap1 was amplified from a HeLa cDNA library and cloned into the pBabe-puro retroviral vector. hRap1 truncations were generated by PCR using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from full-length hRap1 and cloned into the pBabe retroviral vector. Constructs were named hRap1 (full-length, amino acids 1–399), ΔMyb (amino acids 1–132 and 192–399), ΔLink (amino acids 1–198 and 224–399), ΔRCT (amino acids 1–290, with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal PRRK), ΔRΔC(ΔRCT/ΔCoil-Coil, amino acids 1–227, with an N-terminal nuclear localization signal PRRK), and ΔBRCT (amino acids 129–399). Full-length and mutant hRap1 are tagged with FLAG epitopes at both the N and C termini. The retroviral vectors were used to transfect BOSC23 cells by the calcium phosphate method to produce retroviruses for subsequent infection of HeLa S3, HT1080, or HTC75 cells (28Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). To generate cells stably expressing hRap1 and its mutants, human HeLa S3 and HT1080 cells were infected with the hRap1 retroviruses. These cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin after infection for 3 days to obtain cells stably expressing hRap1 and its mutants. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—HeLa S3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hRap1 or mutants were grown in suspension up to 1 × 106 cells/ml. A total of 1–6 × 109 cells were collected for nuclear extract preparation. Briefly, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), allowed to swell for 15 min in hypotonic buffer, and homogenized until cell membrane lysis was ∼80% complete. Cells were resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and homogenized briefly to break the nuclear membrane. An equal volume of high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) was added followed by agitation for 30 min at 4 °C, and the samples were spun down at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed in BC0 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.3, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 3 h and centrifuged again. The cleared supernatant was then separated into aliquots, quickly frozen, and stored at -80 °C. Immunoprecipitation and Mass Spectrometry—For large scale affinity purification, ∼70 mg of nuclear protein extract was thawed gently and centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to spin down denatured protein. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (3.3 mg/ml, Sigma) for 3 h at4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times with NETN (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA), and the bound protein was eluted twice with 100 μl of 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK) (Sigma) in NETN. The eluant and bead fractions were boiled in SDS loading buffer, separated on a precast 8–12% SDS-PAGE gradient gel (BioRad), and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Bands were excised, digested in trypsin and subjected to ion trap mass spectrometry as previously described (29Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schiltz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Peptides were identified using PROWL (prowl.rockefeller.edu). For small scale immunoprecipitation experiments, 1–3 mg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads or 10 μg of anti-hRap1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) and 15 μl of protein A/G agarose beads. Ethidium bromide was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. The beads were then washed four times with 0.5 ml NETN, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and separated on 8 or 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Antibodies and Western Blotting Analysis—For Western analysis, immunoprecipitates and nuclear extract controls were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The primary antibodies mouse monoclonal anti-Rad50 (Gene Tex, MS-Rad 10-PX1), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, F-3165), mouse monoclonal anti-TRF2 (Oncogene, OP129–100UG), and goat anti-PARP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-1561). The secondary antibodies included anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz, SC-2354), anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad, 170–6516), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling). The rabbit polyclonal anti-hRap1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories) was generated against glutathione S-transferase-tagged full-length hRap1 fusion protein. The anti-hRap1 antibody was affinity-purified and shown to be able to Western blot, immunoprecipitate, and immuno-stain endogenous hRap1 (see Figs. 2, 3, 4).Fig. 3Deletional analysis of the interaction of the hRap1 complex.A, a schematic representation of various hRap1 deletion mutant constructs. Each construct was FLAG-tagged (see “Materials and Methods” for details). L stands for the linker region. B, nuclear extracts of HeLa S3 cells stably expressing full-length and mutant hRap1 were collected. The nuclear extracts were then immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-Rad50, anti-Ku86, anti-TRF2, and anti-FLAG antibodies.

The mU6 promoter was then linked to EM7-Zeo (Zeocin resistance, Invitrogen) flanked by BamHI and HindIII sites to generate the mU6-Zeo cassette. EM7-Zeo was used as stuffer DNA to facilitate cloning. To construct a retroviral vector (pCL-puro-mU6) for expression of shRNA, the cytomegalovirus promoter was first cloned into the 5′ long terminal repeat of pBabe-puro. Then the BamH1 and HindIII sites on pCL-puro were destroyed before the mU6-Zeo cassette was cloned between the NheI and XbaI sites of the 3′ long terminal repeat region. For the hRAP1 shRNA vector, oligo 1 (GATCTTTgagagccctcctgattttgaaTTCAAGAGAttcaaaatcaggagggctctcTTTTTG-GA) and oligo 2 (AGCTTCCAAAAAgagagccctcctgattttgaaTCTCTTGAAttcaaaatcaggagggctctcA-AA) were annealed and ligated between the BamH1 and HindIII sites of pCL-puro-mU6. Quantification of Telomere Length—HT1080 and HTC75 cells stably expressing hRap1 or shRNA constructs were passaged and harvested at different population doubling time points for DNA extraction (DNeasy Tissue Kit, Qiagen). Telomere restriction fragment length analysis was performed as described (2Okabe J. Eguchi A. Masago A. Hayakawa T. Nakanishi M. Hum. Mol.

Quantification of telomere length was performed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) and TELORUN (31Ouellette M.M. Liao M. Herbert B.S. Johnson M. Holt S.E. Liss H.S. Shay J.W. Wright W.E.

Immunofluorescence—The localization of telomere-associated proteins was visualized through indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Cells were grown overnight on coverslips, permeabilized in the Triton X-100 solution (0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized again in the Triton X-100 solution containing 300 mm sucrose. The cells were subsequently blocked for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% goat serum, stained with various primary and fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h each at 37 °C, and then visualized under a Nikon TE200 fluorescence microscope. Primary antibodies used are polyclonal anti-hRap1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories), polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and monoclonal anti-TRF2 antibody (Oncogene Science). Secondary antibodies are Alexfluo 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit antibody (Rockland). Identification of the hRap1 Protein Complex—To identify the hRap1 complex, an affinity purification method was utilized (see “Material and Methods”). HeLa S3 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hRap1 were first generated. Similar to endogenous hRap1, FLAG-hRap1 remained co-localized with endogenous TRF2 in these cells (see Fig. 5B), suggesting that FLAG-tagged hRap1 was targeted to the telomeres in the same fashion as endogenous hRap1 (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins were then extracted from these cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody that was conjugated to agarose beads. The precipitated proteins were eluted with FLAG peptides and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Distinct bands (compared with uneluted fractions) were subsequently excised, trypsin-digested, and sequenced by mass spectrometry.Fig. 1Analysis of the hRap1 complex by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Nuclear extracts of HeLa S3 cells stably expressing FLAG-hRap1 were collected, immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG conjugated agarose beads, and eluted with the FLAG peptide. The eluants were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE, and the individual bands were identified by ion trap mass spectrometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We found hRap1 to co-purify with TRF2 (band 6) (Fig. 1 and Table I), in agreement with previous findings that hRap1 associates with TRF2 (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In addition, Rad50 (band 1) and Mre11 (band 4) were detected. Both Rad50 and Mre11 are subunits of the MRN complex, which has been shown to interact with TRF2 (22Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). NBS1, the other subunit of the MRN complex, was not detected in our large scale immunoprecipitation experiments of hRap1. NBS1 has been shown, however, to associate with TRF2 only in S-phase (22Zhu X.D. Kuster B. Mann M. Petrini J.H. de Lange T. Nat.

The p110 band (band 2) turned out to be poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) (32Ziegler M. Oei S.L. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Two other PARPs, namely tankyrase 1 and 2, interact with TRF1 and are known regulators of telomere length in mammalian cells (10Morse R.H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 51-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 33Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T.

These two proteins heterodimerize and are required for double-strand DNA break repair (37Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 759-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Previous studies have found that Ku70 and Ku86 associate with telomeres (38Hsu H.L. Gilley D.

Blasco M.A. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the Ku70/86 heterodimer may be alternatively recruited to the telomeres through its interaction with the hRap1 complex. Endogenous hRap1 Associates with Ku86 and Rad50—We next examined the interaction between endogenous hRap1 and the proteins identified in the hRap1 complex through immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-hRap1 and anti-TRF2 antibodies. Ethidium bromide was added in the reactions to rule out the possibility that some proteins might associate with hRap1 through double-stranded DNA. As shown in Fig. 2, immunoprecipitation of endogenous hRap1 from HeLa cell nuclear extracts was able to specifically pull down TRF2, Ku86, Rad50, and hRap1. Similarly, hRap1, Ku86, and Rad50 were also detected in the immunoprecipitates of endogenous TRF2. This result suggests that hRap1 as well as TRF2 interacts with Ku86 and the MRN complex in vivo. Structural Organization of the hRap1 Protein Complex—To delineate how different regions of the hRap1 protein may interact with other proteins in the hRap1 complex, FLAG-tagged hRap1 deletion mutants lacking each of the four predicted domains or the linker region between the Myb and coil-coil domains were constructed (Fig. 3A). HeLa S3 cells that stably expressed these mutants were then generated. The expression levels of hRap1 mutants were about 1–5-fold of the endogenous protein (Fig. 3D). The different hRap1 mutant proteins were subsequently immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG antibody, and their associations with TRF2 and Rad50 were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 3B, hRap1 mutants lacking the RCT domain (ΔRCT) or both the coiled-coil and RCT domains (ΔRΔC) failed to immunoprecipitate TRF2. These results suggest that the hRap1 RCT domain mediates hRap1 association with TRF2 in vivo. This is consistent with previous findings that the hRap1 RCT domain could bind TRF2 through yeast-two-hybrid studies (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We showed above that members of the MRN complex can associate with hRap1 in vivo. This interaction may occur through TRF2, as previously hypothesized (6Kim Sh S.H. Kaminker P. Campisi J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 503-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If this is the case, the hRap1 ΔRCT mutants that have lost the TRF2 binding abilities should fail to bind the MRN complex. To our surprise, both the ΔRCT and ΔRΔC hRap1 mutants still retained their binding activity with Rad50 and Mre11 (Fig. 3B). In fact, none of the mutations tested ablated or diminished the association of hRap1 with members of the MRN complex. Interestingly, Ku86 association was not abolished among the Rap1 mutants (Fig. 3B), albeit a reduction of Ku86 association was detected for two of the hRap1 mutants (ΔMyb and ΔBRCT). Because the interactions between hRap1 and Rad50/Mre11 or Ku86 were maintained even in mutants that failed to bind TRF2, it is therefore likely that hRap1 can recruit Rad50, Mre11, and Ku86 independent of TRF2. It also suggests that multiple domains of hRap1 may be involved in binding of these proteins. We next examined the interaction of PARP1 with the various hRap1 mutants. In contrast to the proteins examined above, PARP1 no longer co-purified with the hRap1 ΔRCT mutant (Fig. 3C). This was not the case, however, for the hRap1 ΔMyb, ΔLink (Fig. 3C), and ΔBRCT mutants (data not shown). Therefore, PARP1 likely binds hRap1 either directly to the RCT domain or indirectly through TRF2. hRap1 Negatively Regulates Telomere Length—Overexpression of full-length hRap1 was shown to extend telomeres in HT1080-derived HTC75 cells (7Li B. Oestreich S. de Lange T. Cell. 2000; 101: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 17Li B. De Lange T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 5060-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Whether endogenous hRap1 is a positive or negative regulator of telomere length, however, remains unknown. In addition, if hRap1 does regulate telomere length in vivo, which protein(s) may be necessary for such activity remains to be determined. To address the role of hRap1 in telomere length control, we first generated HTC75 cells in which hRap1 levels were stably reduced using shRNA (26Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar, 27Tuschl T. Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 41Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8162) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses indicated that endogenous hRap1 levels decreased significantly (50.0 ± 10.0%) in hRap1 shRNA cells (Fig. 4A). This inhibition of hRap1 expression was sustained for weeks, allowing for relatively long term studies of telomere length in these cells. We then compared the telomere length of these hRap1 knockdown cells to that of control cells at different cell passages. As shown in Fig. 4B, knockdown of hRap1 resulted in detectable extension of telomeres (∼500 bp) as early as population doubling 10. This finding not only implicates hRap1 in negatively regulating telomere length but also suggests that this activity is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to human. Telomeric Localization of hRap1 Mutants and Their Modulation of Telomere Length—We have thus far shown that hRap1 can bind TRF2, PARP1, Ku86, and the MRN complex. To determine which of these proteins may be responsible for hRap1 activity, we test"

Previous studies have suggested alternative mechanisms responsible for this process. We examined initiation mechanisms of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway using human neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells. Results indicated that translocation of cytochrome c does not require prior activation of caspases but rather depends on activation of specific BCL-2 family members, depending upon the type of death signal. Thus, DNA damage-induced apoptosis requires new protein synthesis, accumulation of p53 tumor suppressor protein, and p53-dependent induction of BOK and NOXA genes, while a role for BAX in this pathway is not essential. In contrast, apoptosis induced by staurosporine does not require protein synthesis but is characterized by translocation of BAX. Based on these findings, we propose a model of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade induced by DNA damage where proapoptotic BOK substitutes for a function of BAX.

Apoptosis plays an important role in normal development as well as in diverse human disorders including cancer, autoimmunity, and neurodegeneration. It has often been characterized as an active process that depends on activation of “death” genes and new protein synthesis (1Oppenheim R.W. Prevette D. Tytell M. Homma S. Dev.

The difference in requirements of gene activation and protein synthesis for cell death has been clarified in part with the discovery of alternative apoptotic pathways (4Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S.

It has become clear that the extrinsic pathway regulated by extracellular death factors does not typically require gene activation, whereas the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway may depend on it (7Schuler M.

However, other studies demonstrate that initiation of Cyto-c release occurs prior to caspase activation (11Schuler M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldstein J.C. Fitzgerald P. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7337-7342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) where BCL-2 family proteins play a major role. The BCL-2 family includes antiapoptotic proteins BCL-2, BCL-xL, BCL-w, A1, and MCL-1; proapoptotic BAX, BAK, and BOK; and BH3-only members (12Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). Initiation of Cyto-c release depends on oligomerization of multidomain BAK and BAX on mitochondrial membranes (13Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3384) Google Scholar). Members of the prosurvival BCL-2 group inhibit cell death induced by a variety of cytotoxic stimuli. It appears that different members of this group can specifically protect different cell types (12Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). A role for individual BH3-only proteins in controlling apoptosis also appears to be cell type-specific (12Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). These proteins are believed to bind to and neutralize BCL-2-like family members (14Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Induction of BH3-only genes can trigger activation of proapoptotic BAK and BAX (15Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). An essential role in apoptosis induced by BH3-only proteins has been attributed to p53 tumor suppressor protein (7Schuler M. Green D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 684-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is activated in response to DNA damage. Recent reports demonstrate that DNA damage leads to rapid accumulation of this transcription factor, which can regulate transcription of proapoptotic BAK, BAX, NOXA, and PUMA genes (16Pearson A.S. Spitz F.R. Swisher S.G. Kataoka M. Sarkiss M.G. Meyn R.E. McDonnell T.J. Cristiano R.J. Roth J.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 887-890PubMed Google Scholar, 17Igata E. Inoue T. Ohtani-Fujita N. Sowa Y.

The extent of p53-dependent induction of these genes varies significantly in different cell types, and a role for individual proapoptotic members of BCL-2 family in DNA damage-induced p53-dependent apoptosis remains to be clarified. In this study, we examined a role for caspases and new protein synthesis in induction of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and identified an essential role for BOK and NOXA proteins in p53-dependent cell death induced by DNA damage. Cell Culture—SH-SY5Y and MCF7 cells were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Repository at Georgetown University Lombardi Cancer Center (Washington, D. C.). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The cultures were maintained in a logarithmic phase by passage every 2–3 days. Transfection experiments were performed using Mirus TransIT-100 reagent (Panvera). To obtain stably transfected cells, selection was performed during 2–3 weeks in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). In control experiments, cells were transfected with an empty corresponding expression vector. Apoptosis was induced in cultured cells by incubation with 0.5 μm staurosporine or 50 μm etoposide in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX). Assessment of Cell Viability—Cell viability was measured by retention and deesterification of calcein AM (20Eldadah B.A. Yakovlev A.G. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, culture media in 96-well plates were replaced with 5 μm calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in Locke's buffer containing 154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer (PerSeptive Biosystems) at 485 nm excitation and 560 nm emission wavelengths. In some experiments, cell viability was measured by direct counting of apoptotic cells after staining with Hoechst 33258. At least 100 cells were counted in each of three independent experiments. Apoptosome Activation Assay—Pellets of control or treated cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 250 mm sucrose. Homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and stored at -80 °C until used. Protein concentration was estimated using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) according to recommendations by the manufacturer. Twenty-microgram aliquots of the cytosolic extracts were incubated in the absence or presence of 1 mm dATP and 10 μg/ml Cyto-c at 37 °C for 1 h in a final volume of 20 μl of caspase activation buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm phosphocreatinine, 150 μg/ml creatine kinase). At the end of the incubation, aliquots of reaction mixtures (20 μg of protein in 100 μl of caspase activity assay buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) were mixed with equal volumes of 40 μm fluorescent tetrapeptide substrate (Ac-DEVD-AMC, Bachem) in the same buffer solution. Caspase activity was measured using a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer (Applied Biosystems) as described below. Caspase Activity Assay—Aliquots of cytosolic extracts (20 μg of protein in 100 μl of caspase assay buffer) were mixed with equal volumes of 40 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC in the same buffer. Free aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) accumulation, which resulted from cleavage of the aspartate-AMC bond, was monitored continuously in each sample over 30 min in 96-well microtiter plates using a CytoFluor 4000 fluorometer at 360 nm excitation and 460 emission wavelengths. The emission from each well was plotted against time. Linear regression analysis of the initial velocity (slope) of each curve yielded an activity for each sample. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. To analyze a total protein content, cells were lysed on ice in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. To obtain cytosolic fractions, cells were lysed for 5 min on ice in a solution consisting of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 250 mm sucrose, and 200 μg/ml digitonin. After removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, a portion of the lysate (30–50 μg of protein) was then fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was stained with Ponceau S to confirm equal loading and transfer of samples and was then probed with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). A polyclonal rabbit antibody to active caspase-3 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (New England Biolabs, 9661); a monoclonal mouse antibody to caspase-9 was from Medical and Biological Laboratories (MBL, clone 5B4); a monoclonal rat antibody to APAF-1 was from Alexis Biochemicals (804-348-C100); a monoclonal mouse antibody to β-actin was from Sigma (A5441), polyclonal rabbit antibodies to BAK and BAX were from Upstate Biotechnology (06-536 and 06-499); polyclonal rabbit antibodies to procaspase-3, BCL-2, and BCL-xL were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-7148, sc-783, and sc-1690); a polyclonal rabbit antibody to BOK was from Abgent (AP1310a); a mouse monoclonal antibody to Cyto-c was from BD Biosciences (556433); a mouse monoclonal antibody to NOXA was from Imgenex (IMG-349); a mouse monoclonal antibody to p53 was from Oncogene Research Products (OP43); rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PUMA were from Oncogene Research Products (PC686) and Axxora (PSC-3043-C100); and a monoclonal rat antibody to caspase-2 was from Apotech (APO-20A-053-C100). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Abundance of mRNAs encoding proapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family was examined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total cellular RNA was isolated by acidic phenol extraction (50Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar) and treated with DNase I. RT was performed using 10 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcription reaction (Invitrogen). One-tenth of the resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR. PCR primers were as follows (sense and antisense, respectively): BAD, 5′-GGCGATGAGCTGGAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-ACATTTGGTAGTGAGCACGG-3′; BAK, 5′-AGAGCTGTCTGAACTCACGT-3′ and 5′-TTACACTGTGCCAGAGCCAT-3′; BAX, 5′-AAGAAGCTGAGCGAGTGT-3′ and 5′-GGAGGAAGTCCAATGTC-3′; BID, 5′-ACCCTAGAGACATGGAGAAG-3′ and 5′-AGCTATCTTCCAGCCTGTCT-3′; BIK, 5′-TCATGGACGGTTTCACCACA-3′ and 5′-CAGTGTTCCAGCACTATCTC-3′; BIM, 5′-ATGAGAAGATCCTCCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-AATGCATTCTCCACACCAGG-3′; BOK, 5′-GGCGATGAGCTGGAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-ACACTTGAGGACATCAGTCC-3′; HRK, 5′-CAGGCGGAACTTGTAGGAAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGATTTCCAAAGGGCTT-3′; NOXA, 5′-GTGCCCTTGGAAACGGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCGCCCAGTCTAATCA-3′; PUMA, 5′-CAGACTGTGAATCCTGTGCT-3′ and 5′-ACAGTATCTTACAGGCTGGG-3′; and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCTGCCCCCTCTGCTGATGC-3′ and 5′-CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTAG-3′. Amplification profiles included denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 15 s at 55 °C, and primer extension for 60 s at 72 °C. Numbers of cycles were estimated to be optimal to provide a linear relationship between the amount of input template and the amount of PCR product generated over a wide concentration range from 1 to 20 μg of total RNA as described in detail previously (21Yakovlev A.G. Knoblach S.M. Fan L. Fox G.B. Goodnight R. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7415-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The identity of specific PCR products was confirmed by subcloning in the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and sequencing of the inserts. Real Time Multiplex PCR—RT was performed as described above. Fluorophore-labeled LUX forward and unlabeled reverse PCR primers were as follows: BAX, 5′-CACAGGTGGTGCTCAAGGCCCTG5G-3′ and 5′-GGGTGAGGAGGCTTGAGGAGT-3′; BOK, 5′-CACGTTCAGCGTCTACCGCAACG5G-3′ and 5′-CGCATACAGGGACACCACCT-3′; NOXA, 5′-GACGCTTCGTGTTCAGCTCGCG5C-3′ and 5′-CTCGGTTGA GCGTTCTTGC-3′; PUMA, 5′-CACCTTGGACTCAGCATCGGAAGG5G-3′ and 5′-GCACCAGCACAACAGCCTTT-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CACCCATTTGGCTACAGCAA CAG5-G-3′ and 5′-GGACTGAGTGTGGCAGGGACT-3′. Multiplex PCRs combined pairs of primers to amplify each experimental and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Fifty-microliter reactions contained 5 μl of cDNA, a 200 nm concentration of each gene-specific primer, 1× Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen), and 1× ROX reference dye. PCR was conducted in a 96-well spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system, Applied Biosystems). Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 2 min and subjected to 50 cycles of amplification. Amplification profiles included denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C, annealing for 15 s at 55 °C, and primer extension for 30 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence was automatically monitored during every PCR cycle and during the post-PCR temperature ramp. Changes in gene expression were calculated according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen) and previous reports (22Lowe B. Avila H.A. Bloom F.R. Gleeson M. Kusser W. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 315: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transverse Alternating Field Electrophoresis (TAFE)—Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0), mixed with 150 μl of agarose solution (1% agarose in lysis buffer kept at 42 °C), and poured into a plug mold. After solidification, plugs were incubated twice for 24 h each in 5 volumes of lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mg/ml Proteinase K (Sigma) and 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (Sigma) at 50 °C. Plugs were then incubated for at least 24 h in 100 volumes of Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C with at least two changes of buffer and then stored at 4 °C until usage. DNA was subjected to TAFE in 1% agarose in 1× TAFE buffer (20× TAFE: 0.2 m Tris, 7.8 mm EDTA, and 0.5% glacial acetic acid) at 170 V for 30 min with 4-s pulses followed by 150 V for 18 h with 35-s pulses. This program allowed for resolution of DNA molecules up to 1000 kb. λ DNA ladders (50–1000 kb) were used as standards. DNA fragments were visualized by staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Confocal Laser Scanning Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were plated on glass coverslips (1943-10012, Bellco Glass Inc., Vineland, NJ) in 24-well plates. Control and etoposide-treated cell cultures were fixed by incubating with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times for 3 min each time with PBS followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (10% normal goat serum (S-1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA), 0.1%Triton X-100 in PBS). The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. A polyclonal rabbit antibody to BAX was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (06-499), a polyclonal rabbit antibody to BOK was from Oncogene Research Products (PC627), and a mouse monoclonal antibody to NOXA was from Imgenex (IMG-349). To establish subcellular localization we used antibodies against mitochondrial markers such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (A-6403, Molecular Probes) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-110, Stressgen). The coverslips were washed three times for 3 min each time with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer solution (a combination of goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (2 μg/ml, A-11034, Molecular Probes) with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 546 (2 μg/ml, A-11030, Molecular Probes)). The coverslips were washed two times for 3 min each time with PBS followed by mounting on microscope slides with the ProLong Antifade kit (P7481, Molecular Probes). The imaging was performed using a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META). The visualization of the fluorophores was achieved using the argon ion laser emitting at 488 nm and helium-neon laser emitting at 543 nm, respectively. RNA Interference—Complementary hairpin oligonucleotides were designed using the “siRNA Converter” Internet tool (Ambion), 2See www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html. annealed, and cloned between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites in pSilencer™ 3.1-H1/neo (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows (sense and antisense, respectively): human BAX, 5′-GATCCCGCGCATCGGGGACGAACTGTTCAAGAGACAGTTCGTCCCCGATGCGCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGCGCATCGGGGACGAACTGTCTCTTGAACAGTTCGTCCCCGATGCGCGG-3′; human BOK, 5′-GATCCCGGTGGTGTCCCTGTATGCGTTCAAGAGACGCATACAGGGACACCACCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGGTGGTGTCCCTGTATGCGTCTCTTGAACGCATACAGGGACACCACCGG-3′; and human NOXA, 5′-GATCCCGTCGAGTGTGCTACTCAACTTCAAGAGAGTTGAGTAGCACACTCGACTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGTCGAGTGTGCTACTCAACTCTCTTGAAGTTGAGTAGCACACTCGACGG-3′. Inhibitory effects of RNA interference on expression of specific genes were tested in transiently transfected MCF7 cells by Western blotting or RT-PCR. Induction of Apoptosis by Etoposide and Staurosporine—Treatment of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with etoposide or staurosporine caused a rapid increase in caspase-3-like activity and cell death (Fig. 1, A and B). To evaluate specific pathways of apoptosis induced by these drugs, we used SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the dominant negative (DN) forms of human procaspase-8 or procaspase-9. Cells transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA3.1) served as a transfection control. Previous studies have shown that expression of these DN procaspases specifically inhibits activation of their endogenous counterparts (23Pan G. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5841-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Expression of the recombinant caspases in pooled clones was confirmed using the antibodies that recognized a FLAG epitope fused at the C termini of the DN mutants (data not shown). In accord with previous reports (24Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Williams R.S. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 25Karpinich N.O. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16547-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of procaspase-9 DN inhibited DEVDase activation and cell death after treatment with etoposide or staurosporine. Overexpression of procaspase-8 DN mutant did not affect caspase activation or cell death induced by these drugs (Fig. 1, A and B). Inhibition of caspase-8 or -9 by their DN forms did not inhibit the release of Cyto-c to the cytosol as shown by results of immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 1C). Western immunostaining of protein extracts from etoposide-treated SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated specific activation of caspase-2 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, cleavage of procaspase-2 was almost completely inhibited in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing procaspase-9 DN and was not detected in MCF7 cells that do not express procaspase-3 (26Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Induction of apoptosis by staurosporine in this MCF7 cell line and MCF7 cells stably transfected with human procaspase-3 resulted in cytosolic accumulation of Cyto-c with no significant difference between the cell lines (Fig. 1E). In contrast, treatment with etoposide failed to induce the release of Cyto-c in nontransfected or transfected MCF7 cells (Fig. 1E). An ability of recombinant procaspase-3 to undergo activation in MCF7 cells was demonstrated after treatment with 30 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor α and 10 μg/ml CHX (Fig. 1F). Requirement of Protein Synthesis for Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—A role for new protein synthesis in initiation of apoptosis was addressed by treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with staurosporine or etoposide in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml CHX. The extent of cell death was measured by direct counting of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2A). Caspase activity was assessed using the fluorogenic substrate assay (Fig. 2B). Specific cleavage of procaspase-3 and procaspase-9 was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). In the absence of CHX, treatment with each of the drugs resulted in activation of caspase-9 and -3 followed by manifestation of apoptotic morphology in ∼95% of cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis by CHX did not affect the extent of apoptosis induced by staurosporine but markedly inhibited activation of caspase-9 and -3 as well as chromatin condensation in cells treated with etoposide (Fig. 2C). Progression of caspase-9-dependent apoptosis is mediated by the release of Cyto-c from mitochondria to cell cytosol. Therefore, we examined whether pretreatment with CHX inhibited this process, and levels of cytosolic Cyto-c were analyzed in SH-SY5Y cells treated with etoposide or staurosporine in the absence or presence of CHX. Cyto-c content in cell cytosol was examined by immunoblotting. Results showed that both drugs induced the release of Cyto-c within 5 h. CHX blocked this effect of etoposide but did not inhibit Cyto-c release induced by staurosporine (Fig. 2C). Inhibition of protein synthesis could potentially weaken proapoptotic effects of etoposide by decreasing expression levels of topoisomerase 2, thus leading to inhibition of DNA damage. Alternatively it could decrease apoptotic potential by reducing expression levels of essential proapoptotic proteins. To test these possibilities, we examined effects of CHX on the extent of DNA damage and expression levels of cytochrome c, APAF-1, procaspase-9, and procaspase-3. DNA damage was assessed using transverse alternating field electrophoresis. This method detected an appearance of 1000-kb DNA fragments as early as 1 h in etoposide-treated but not in control cells. Inhibition of protein synthesis did not affect the extent of DNA degradation at least during the first 6 h of treatment (Fig. 3A). Results of Western analysis showed that protein levels of none of the examined components of the apoptosome changed significantly in the presence of CHX (Fig. 3B). Furthermore cytosolic extracts isolated from control or CHX-treated SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in the presence of Cyto-c and dATP to evaluate an overall apoptosome potential. In these experiments caspase-3-like activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate assay. Results demonstrated that inhibition of protein synthesis during 6 h had no effect on apoptosome-mediated caspase-3 activation (Fig. 3C). Requirement of p53 Induction for Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—DNA damage leads to stabilization and activation of p53 tumor suppressor protein and results in Cyto-c release (7Schuler M. Green D.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 684-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the actual connection between p53 activation and initiation of apoptosis remains to be clarified. Western blot analysis revealed that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with etoposide resulted in a marked increase in p53 protein level. Treatment with staurosporine had a much weaker effect. Accumulation of p53 was blocked in the presence of CHX (Fig. 4A). To assess a potential link between induction of p53, Cyto-c release, and consequent caspase activation, we inhibited endogenous p53 by overexpression of its DN mutant (R175H) (27Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 28Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar) in SH-SY5Y cells. R175H-mediated inhibition of p53 blocked the release of Cyto-c induced by etoposide; however, it did not inhibit this process after treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of this p53 DN mutant also inhibited etoposide-induced activation of caspase-3 but did not affect activation of this caspase in cells treated with staurosporine (Fig. 4B). Furthermore inactivation of p53 significantly increased viability of SH-SY5Y cells after treatment with etoposide but not after treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 4C). p53-dependent Expression Profiles of Proapoptotic BCL-2 Family Members—p53 is an essential transcription factor that regulates g"
https://openalex.org/W2049193842,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity and Ca(2+) signaling led to a turnover of focal adhesions (FAs) required for cell spreading and migration. We used yellow Cameleon-2 (Ycam), a fluorescent protein-based Ca(2+) sensor fused to FAK or to a FAK-related non-kinase domain, to measure simultaneously local Ca(2+) variations at FA sites and FA dynamics. Discrete subcellular Ca(2+) oscillators initiate both propagating and abortive Ca(2+) waves in migrating U87 astrocytoma cells. Ca(2+)-dependent FA disassembly occurs when the Ca(2+) wave reaches individual FAs, indicating that local but not global Ca(2+) increases trigger FA disassembly. An unexpectedly rapid flux of FAK between cytosolic and FA compartments was revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies. The FAK-Ycam recovery half-time (17 s) at FAs was slowed (to 29 s) by Ca(2+) elevation. FAK-related non-kinase domain-Ycam had a faster, Ca(2+)-insensitive recovery half-time (11 s), which is consistent with the effect of Ca(2+) on FAK-Ycam dynamics not being due to a general modification of the dynamics of FA components. Because FAK association at FAs was prolonged by Ca(2+) and FAK autophosphorylation was correlated to intracellular Ca(2+) levels, we propose that local Ca(2+) elevations increase the residency of FAK at FAs, possibly by means of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, thereby leading to increased activation of its effectors involved in FA disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W2130704889,"Both pro- and antiapoptotic activities of NF-κB transcription factor have been observed; however, less is known about the mechanism by which NF-κB induces apoptosis. To elucidate how NF-κB regulates proapoptotic signaling, we performed functional analyses using wild-type, ikk1-/-, ikk2-/-, rela-/- murine fibroblasts, MDAPanc-28/Puro, MDAPanc-28/IκBαM, and HCT116/p53+/+ and HCT116/p53-/- cells with investigational anticancer agent doxycycline as a superoxide inducer for generating apoptotic stimulus. In this report, we show that doxycycline increased superoxide generation and subsequently activated NF-κB, which in turn up-regulated p53 expression and increased the stability and DNA binding activity of p53. Consequently, NF-κB-dependent p53 activity induced the expression of p53-regulated genes PUMA and p21waf1 as well as apoptosis. Importantly, lack of RelA, IKK, and p53 as well as expression of a dominant negative IκBα (IκBαM) inhibited NF-κB-dependent p53 activation and apoptosis. The doxycycline-induced NF-κB activation was not inhibited in HCT116/p53-/- cells. Our results demonstrate that NF-κB plays an essential role in activation of wild-type p53 tumor suppressor to initiate proapoptotic signaling in response to overgeneration of superoxide. Thus, these findings reveal a mechanism of NF-κB-regulated proapoptotic signaling.

The mammalian Rel/NF-κB 1The abbreviations used are: NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PUMA, p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; ROS, reactive oxygen species. family, which consists of RelA (p65), Rel (v-rel), RelB, p50 (p105), and p52 (p100), plays a key role in the regulation of immune response, inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (1Verma I.M.

NF-κB is activated through a complex network of kinase signaling cascades in response to various stimuli (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

Recently we have demonstrated the mechanism by which pro-inflammatory cytokines induce biphasic NF-κB activation (9Schmidt C. Peng B. Li Z. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Niu J. Schmidt-Supprian M.

IKK1 and IKK2 are the essential kinases in signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB proteins and subsequent activation of NF-κB, which in turn induces a large number of genes to affect the subsequent response and phenotype of a cell (5Karin M.

RelA, the p65 subunit of Rel/NF-κB transcription factors has been shown to play a key role in protecting cells from proapoptotic stimuli (14Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar, 15Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). Similarly, radiation-, daunorubicin-, or TNF-α-induced apoptosis is potentiated in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma and Jurkat cell lines transfected with dominant negative IκBα (16Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar, 17Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that proapoptotic signals can induce Rel/NF-κB, which in turn induces expression of the genes involved in suppressing apoptotic signals (4Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) (18Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of apoptosis c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 and Bcl-2 family members Bcl-xL and Bfl1/A1 have been proposed to mediate NF-κB-dependent antiapoptotic signaling (19Javelaud D. Besancon F.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6510-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, a proapoptotic aspect of RelA activity has also been reported (24Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 25Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For example, the induction of apoptosis by glucocorticoids is promoted by inhibition of NF-κB, whereas apoptosis induced in the same cells by stimulation with phorbol ester and ionomycin for mimicking T-cell activation requires NF-κB (28Lin B. Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that NF-κB induces cell death following T-cell receptor engagement or DNA-damaging agents (24Kasibhatla S. Brunner T. Genestier L. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 543-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 25Kasibhatla S. Genestier L. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473PubMed Google Scholar). Other reports have shown that NF-κB activation is required for the onset of apoptosis induced by alphavirus or kainic acid (27Nakai M. Qin Z.H. Chen J.F. Wang Y. Chase T.N. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 29Lin K.I. DiDonato J.A. Hoffmann A. Hardwick J.M. Ratan R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1479-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These studies further emphasize that the function of NF-κB can be proapoptotic or antiapoptotic, depending on cell type, extent of NF-κB activation, and nature of the apoptotic signals. However, how NF-κB induces apoptosis and which proapoptotic downstream target genes is induced by NF-κB still remains unclear. The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in regulating expression of genes that mediate cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in response to genotoxic insults (30Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar, 31Rowan S. Ludwig R.L. Haupt Y. Bates S. Lu X. Oren M. Vousden K.H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 827-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are some of the potent activators of p53 and they appear to be key factors generated in chemotherapeutic agents induced p53 activation (32Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). The important function of p53 in mediating hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis is demonstrated in p53-null cells, suggesting that loss of the function of p53 is a contributing factor to the chemotherapeutic resistance in tumors (33Yin Y. Terauchi Y. Solomon G.G. Aizawa S. Rangarajan P.N. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Barrett J.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34Kitamura Y. Ota T. Matsuoka Y. Tooyama I. Kimura H. Shimohama S. Nomura Y. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Taniguchi T. Glia. 1999; 25: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Following environmental insults, p53 is activated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation that increase its protein stability and enhance its DNA binding activity (35Mitani K. Nippon Rinsho. 2001; 59: 2316-2321PubMed Google Scholar, 36Colman M.S. Afshari C.A. Barrett J.C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 37Sionov R.V. Haupt Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6145-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how these posttranslational mechanisms that modulate p53 activity are regulated by ROS. Activated p53 up-regulates expression of several of its downstream target genes, including p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) (38Nakano K. Vousden K.H. Mol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5239) Google Scholar), and thus the high levels of p53 activity can either result in cell cycle arrest or directly promote cell death (42Yonish-Rouach E. Grunwald D. Wilder S. Kimchi A. May E. Lawrence J.J. May P. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1415-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 43Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). A number of factors including the cell type, the specific insults, and the extent of the damage may contribute this decision for apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. In response to many inducing agents, the activity of a well documented antiapoptotic transcriptional factor, NF-κB, and proapoptotic factor, p53, are simultaneously activated (44Del Rio M.J. Velez-Pardo C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 45Yang C.R. Wilson-Van Patten C. Planchon S.M. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Davis T.W. Cuthill S. Miyamoto S.

Immunol. 1999; 93: 152-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The functional NF-κB and p53 activity may modulate each other, which in turn would affect the subsequent responses (47Webster G.A. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3485-3495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Teragonkar V. Pando M. Vafa O. Wahl G. Verma I.

Doxycycline and the newly developed chemically modified tetracycline derivatives COL-3 have been evaluated in preclinical cancer models and early clinical trials because these agents inhibit various zinc-dependent enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinase family and induce apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines (49Gilbertson-Beadling S.

However, the mechanism by which doxycycline induces apoptosis remains unclear. Kroon and co-workers (53Kroon A.M. Holtrop M. Fries H. Melis T. van den Bogert C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 54van den Bogert C. Dontje B.H. Wybenga J.J. Kroon A.M. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1943-1947PubMed Google Scholar) showed that tetracycline acts as an anticancer agent by preferentially inhibiting mitochondrial protein synthesis, including cytochrome c oxidase, the key components of electron transport chain, and decrease of its synthesis may lead to a disruption of electron transport function and lead to electron leakage from the respiratory chain to O2, thus resulting elevated levels of superoxide radicals. In this study, we performed functional analyses using ikk1-/-, ikk2-/-, and rela-/- fibroblasts and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM and HCT116/p53-/- cells to decode the role of NF-κBin regulating p53-dependent proapoptotic signaling in response to doxycycline-induced ROS. Our study reveals a mechanism by which NF-κB functions as a proapoptotic factor by activating the p53 signaling pathway for initiating cell apoptosis. Reagents—Doxycycline was purchased from Sigma. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Genosys. A stock solution of 8 mg/ml doxycycline was prepared immediately before its use in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with a pH of 7.4. Stock solutions were diluted in PBS to allow a 1% volume addition of diluted solutions to the experimental wells. Control wells were added with 1% volume with PBS. Primary antibodies for immunoblotting (IκBα, IκBβ, and β-actin) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Antibodies for p53 immunoblotting and EMSA were purchased from Calbiochem. The proteasome inhibitor PS-341 was reconstituted in PBS and used in 100 nm final concentrations. Radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Culture—The human pancreatic tumor cell line MDAPanc-28, which was originally established by Frazier et al. (55Frazier M.L. Fernandez E. de Llorens R. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Cleary K.R. Abbruzzese J.L. Berry K. Olive M. Le Maistre A. Evans D.B. Int. J. Pancreatol. 1996; 19: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and HCT116 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-incubated fetal bovine serum. The wild-type, ikk1-/-, ikk2-/-, and rela-/- cells were grown on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter of glucose, glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids and supplemented with 12% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were grown at a concentration of 106 cells/ml in 6-well Costar plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 6 days in a 95% O2, 5% CO2 incubator. Aliquots of cells and medium were removed at 2-day intervals. Cultures containing 40 μg/ml of doxycycline were examined, and cell numbers were counted at each time interval with a Coulter Z1 particle counter (Beckman) after the cells were harvested by trypsinization. Subconfluent cells remained untreated or were treated with 40 μg/ml of doxycycline for 12 and 24 h. Cells were then harvested and fixed with ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol for 24 h. After centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), Triton X-100 (0.1%, v/v), 0.1% sodium citrate, and DNase-free RNase (1 μg/ml). Cells were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Measurement of Cellular Superoxide—Superoxide was measured using hydroethidine (HEt, Molecular Probes). Hydroethidine emits light blue fluorescence and, on interaction with O2, is converted to ethidium, which intercalates into the DNA and emits a red fluorescence. After doxycycline treatment, cells were labeled with HEt (100 ng/ml, 60 min) and then analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (56Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using the BD Biosciences CellQuest Pro software package. DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation in apoptotic cells was determined by gel electrophoresis. The cells (50 × 106) treated with doxycycline for the specified times were collected and washed with PBS, followed by incubation with extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0; 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS; and 20 μg/ml of RNase) at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, 100 μg/ml of proteinase K was added, and the sample was incubated at 50 °C for 3 h. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform. The aqueous phase was precipitated with two volumes of 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate for 30 min on ice. The DNA pellet was then washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of Tris-EDTA buffer. The absorbance of the DNA solution at 260 and 280 nm was determined by spectrophotometry. The extracted DNA (40 μg/lane) was subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and then photographed. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—IκBαM expression plasmid and control plasmid containing puromycin-resistant gene were transfected into HCT116 tumor cells by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen) as described (57Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Retroviral Infections of Cell Lines—The CMV-FLAG- IκBαM/puromycin, RelA, and puromycin-alone control retroviruses were generated, and infections were performed as described previously (58Naviaux R.K. Costanzi E. Haas M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5701-5705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants containing the viruses were harvested 48 h later, and filtered supernatants were used to infect cells. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were seeded in a 100-mm dish at a density of 5 × 105 cells in medium containing 500 μg of puromycin (Clontech). Puromycin-resistant cells were pooled for subsequent analysis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—EMSA and preparation of nuclear extracts were performed as described (59Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 60Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeled DNA probes (wild-type κB: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, mutant κB: 5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′, p53: 5′-GTCAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGAGCTC-3′, Sp-1: 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′, and Oct-1: 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′) were mixed with 10 μg of nuclear extract in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 75 mm NaCl; 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 1.5 mm EDTA; 1.5 mm dithiothreitol; 25% glycerol; 20 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin; and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 40 min, and 20 min at 25 °C, and applied to a 4% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25 × TBE (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm borate, 0.5 mm EDTA; pH 8.0) buffer. Equal loading of nuclear extracts was monitored by Oct-1 binding. For competition assays, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides was added to the binding reaction. For antibody supershift assays, 2 μl of the polyclonal antibodies against p65, p50, p52, c-Rel, and p53 were preincubated for 45 min on ice before the probe was added. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried for 1 h at 80 °C and exposed to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -80 °C. Northern Blot Analysis and RT-PCR—For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Fifteen micrograms of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane in the presence of 20× SSC, and UV cross-linked. The blots were hybridized with human p53, PUMA, or p21waf1 cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]deoxycytidine triphosphate using a random labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Equal loading of mRNA samples was monitored by hybridizing the same membrane filter with the cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as described previously (61Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using a pair of PUMA primers (sense primer CCGCCACTGCAGTTAGAGC and antisense primer CATGGTGCAGAGAAAGTCCC) and separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Western Blot Analysis—Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (59Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar, 60Wang W. Abbruzzese J.L. Evans D.B. Larry L. Cleary K.R. Chiao P.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 119-127PubMed Google Scholar) and were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE by electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Osmonics) electrophoretically. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 and incubated with affinity-purified monoclonal antibodies against p53 (Calbiochem); Ser20-phosphorylated p53, which recognizes only Ser20 phosphorylated p53 (New England Biolabs); β-actin and FLAG M2 (Sigma); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against IκBα and IκBβ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were washed in PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 and probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The Lumi-Light Western blot substrate (Roche Applied Science) was used for detection. For determining half-life for p53, MDAPanc-28/Puro, or MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells were treated with 50 μg/ml of doxycycline for 24 h, followed by cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) addition. The cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts were isolated 2, 4, and 8 h after addition of cycloheximide. p53 levels were examined by Western blot analysis with the monoclonal antibody against p53 (Calbiochem). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Pulse chase experiments with [35S]methionine labeling were carried out by culturing the cells in methionine-free medium including 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum for 1 day, followed by adding 300 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in 8 ml of methionine-free medium for 24 h with simultaneous stimulation either with PBS or 50 μg/ml of doxycycline, washing with PBS twice, and further incubating in a medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10 mm non-labeled methionine for the indicated time. To equilibrate detection of p53, 200 and 25 μg of crude cell extracts from PBS- and doxycycline-treated cells were used for p53 immunoprecipitation, respectively, and separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by phosphorimaging and autoradiography. NF-κB Activation Induced p53 Activity in Response to Doxycycline Stimulation—To provide a better understanding of the molecular basis of doxycycline-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells, we first determined the effect of doxycycline on NF-κB activation using MDAPanc-28/Puro and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells. MDAPanc-28/IκBαM human pancreatic tumor cells were generated by pooling puromycin-resistant cells after infection with a retrovirus with or without expression of a FLAG-tagged, phosphorylation-defective mutant of IκBα (IκBαM) (23Dong Q.G. Sclabas G.M. Fujioka S. Schmidt C. Peng B. Wu T. Tsao M.S. Evans D.B. Abbruzzese J.L. McDonnell T.J. Chiao P.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6510-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results showed that the expression of IκBαM efficiently inhibits not only constitutive or high basal NF-κB activity but also cytokine-dependent NF-κB activation in MDAPanc-28 cells (Fig. 1, A-C). The κB-DNA binding specificity and subunit composition were confirmed by competition, supershifting, and κB reporter gene assays, (data not shown). The dose-dependent activation of NF-κB and p53 by doxycycline are shown in Fig. 1D. These results suggested that 20 μg/ml of doxycycline induced a detectable NF-κB and p53 activities and 40 and 60 μg/ml of doxycycline stimulated the peak level of NF-κB and p53 activities. As shown in Fig. 1E, DNA binding activity of the RelA/p50 heterodimer was induced at 12 h and lasted up to 24 h in MDAPanc-28/Puro cells (Fig. 1E, lanes 1-3); the expression of IκBαM inhibited doxycycline-induced NF-κB activation in MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells (Fig. 1E, lanes 4-6). Additional experiments for time-dependent NF-κB activation by doxycycline showed that NF-κB activity was barely detectable at 8 h (data not shown). Consistent with NF-κB activation, the level of IκBα protein, but not the level of IκBαM protein, was substantially decreased at 12 h and the effect was persistent until 24 h after doxycycline stimulation (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these results suggested that doxycycline activated NF-κB. Since both p53 and NF-κB are activated in response to various anticancer agents such as DNA-damaging agents and UV- and γ-irradiation (62Fritsche M. Haessler C. Brandner G.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6203-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we next investigated the p53-DNA binding activity with a specific p53 probe containing the p53 binding site of the p21waf1 promoter using MDAPanc-28/Puro and MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells in the presence and absence of doxycycline stimulation. While the basal p53 DNA binding activity in unstimulated MDAPanc-28/Puro was very low, p53 DNA binding activity was induced after 12 and 24 h of doxycycline stimulation (Fig. 1G, lanes 1-3) but was undetectable in MDAPanc-28/IκBαM cells (Fig. 1G, lanes 4-6). Competition with a wild-type or a control probe (Sp-1) and supershift with anti-p53 antibody showed that the detected DNA binding complex was p53-specific (Fig. 1H). Thus, these results suggested that NF-κB activity is required for doxycycline-mediated p53 activation.

https://openalex.org/W1978125887,"Microcin E492 (MccE492, 7886 Da), the 84-amino acid antimicrobial peptide from Klebsiella pneumoniae, was purified in a post-translationally modified form, MccE492m (8717 Da), from culture supernatants of either the recombinant Escherichia coli VCS257 strain harboring the pJAM229 plasmid or the K. pneumoniae RYC492 strain. Chymotrypsin digestion of MccE492m led to the MccE492m-(74–84) C-terminal fragment that carries the modification and that was analyzed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance at natural abundance. The 831-Da post-translational modification consists of a trimer of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-l-serine linked via a C-glycosidic linkage to a β-d-glucose moiety, itself linked to the MccE492m Ser-84-carboxyl through an O-glycosidic bond. This modification, which mimics a catechol-type siderophore, was shown to bind ferric ions by analysis of the collision-induced dissociation pattern obtained for MccE492m-(74–84) by electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry experiments in the presence of FeCl3. By using a series of wild-type and mutant isogenic strains, the three catechol-type siderophore receptors Fiu, Cir, and FepA were shown to be responsible for the recognition of MccE492m at the outer membrane of sensitive bacteria. Because MccE492m shows a broader spectrum of antibacterial activity and is more potent than MccE492, we propose that by increasing the microcin/receptor affinity, the modification leads to a better recognition and subsequently to a higher antimicrobial activity of the microcin. Therefore, MccE492m is the first member of a new class of antimicrobial peptides carrying a siderophore-like post-translational modification and showing potent activity, which we term siderophore-peptides.

Microcins are low molecular weight antibacterial peptides secreted by enterobacteria, mostly Escherichia coli. As they are active against phylogenetically related Gram-negative bacteria, it has been suggested that they balance the intestinal microbial flora (1Baquero F. Moreno F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1984; 23: 117-124Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although many antimicrobial peptides of microbial origin are produced by large multidomain enzyme complexes, the peptide synthetases, microcins are synthesized through the ribosomal pathway. The microcin genetic systems include a series of genes encoding the microcin precursor, modification enzymes, secretion factors, and immunity proteins. These gene clusters give rise to a broad diversity of microcin structures and mechanisms of action (2Pons A.M. Lanneluc I. Cottenceau G. Sable S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 3Destoumieux-Garzón D. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Microcin E492 (MccE492) was found for the first time in the culture medium of the Klebsiella pneumoniae RYC492 fecal strain (4de Lorenzo V. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was shown to be chromosomally encoded, and the genetic determinants necessary for its production, secretion, and immunity were cloned into the pJAM229 plasmid (5Wilkens M. Villanueva J.E. Cofre J. Chnaiderman J. Lagos R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4789-4794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lagos R. Villanueva J.E. Monasterio O. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 212-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MccE492 was expressed in the recombinant E. coli VCS257 strain harboring the pJAM229 plasmid (5Wilkens M. Villanueva J.E. Cofre J. Chnaiderman J. Lagos R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4789-4794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and characterized as an 84-residue peptide (GETDPNTQLLNDLGNNMAWGAALGAPGGLGSAALGAAGGALQTVGQGLIDHGPVNVPIPVLIGPSWNGSSSGYNSATSSSGSGS) of 7886 Da (7Pons A.M. Zorn N. Vignon D. Delalande F. Van Dorsselaer A. Cottenceau G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 229-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MccE492 is a membrane-active antibacterial peptide (8Lagos R. Wilkens M. Vergara C. Cecchi X. Monasterio O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which depolarizes the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol.

However, this membrane activity alone is not believed to account for the peptide antibacterial properties, which are thought instead to rely on a receptor-mediated mechanism (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol.

In agreement with this hypothesis, enterobactin (12Pollack J.R. Neilands J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 38: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), also named enterochelin (13O'Brien I.G. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 215: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), was shown to be an MccE492 antagonist (14Orellana C. Lagos R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 136: 297-303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enterobactin is an iron-chelating compound (siderophore) produced by enterobacteria (15Payne S.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 16: 81-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and also by some Streptomyces species (16Fiedler H.P. Krastel P. Muller J. Gebhardt K. Zeeck A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 196: 147-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tricatechol derivative of a cyclic triserine lactone (cyclic trimer of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-l-serine, DHBS)1 as well as its breakdown products, the linear DHBS trimer, dimer, and monomer, are able to transport ferric ions into enterobacteria (12Pollack J.R.

FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1990; 55: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). The catecholate iron-siderophore receptors involved, Fiu, Cir, and FepA, have been suggested to recognize MccE492 (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Braun V. Patzer S.I. Hantke K. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 365-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In addition, this recognition was found to be TonB-dependent (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). From the first description of the MccE492 structure (7Pons A.M. Zorn N. Vignon D. Delalande F. Van Dorsselaer A. Cottenceau G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 229-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was thought that together with ColV, MccH47, and MccL, MccE492 belonged to a class of unmodified microcins (2Pons A.M. Lanneluc I. Cottenceau G. Sable S. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the lack of post-translational modification in the MccE492 structure (7Pons A.M. Zorn N. Vignon D. Delalande F. Van Dorsselaer A. Cottenceau G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 229-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was questionable because of the presence within the large genetic system of MccE492 of several genes, three of which displayed homologies with genes encoding glycosyltransferases (mceC), acyltranferases (mceI), and enterobactin esterases (mceD), whereas no homology was found for mceJ and mceE (21Lagos R. Baeza M. Corsini G. Hetz C. Strahsburger E. Castillo J.A. Vergara C. Monasterio O. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In recent work, inactivation of the mceC, mceI, or mceJ genes was shown to result in loss of MccE492 antibacterial activity. Because such inactivation did not result in any modification of the primary structure, the genes concerned were proposed to encode molecular chaperones involved in the acquisition of the MccE492 active conformation rather than modification enzymes (11Corsini G. Baeza M. Monasterio O. Lagos R. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this study, we report for the first time the isolation and characterization of a modified form of MccE492. The structure of this post-translational modification was determined by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. It consists of a sugar moiety carrying a linear trimer of DHBS that is shown to bind a ferric ion. The antibacterial activity of MccE492m was examined against wild-type and mutant strains, and the membrane receptors involved in the microcin recognition at the outer membrane of the sensitive strains were determined. We show here the advantage in terms of activity of the modification carried by MccE492, which thus appears as the first member of a new class of post-translationally modified antibacterial peptides that we name siderophore-peptides. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—Microcin production was performed in E. coli VCS257 (Stratagene), E. coli C600, E. coli C600 aroB– harboring the pJAM229 plasmid (5Wilkens M. Villanueva J.E. Cofre J. Chnaiderman J. Lagos R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4789-4794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and K. pneumoniae RYC492 (4de Lorenzo V. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The bacteria used to establish the spectrum of antibacterial activity were those described previously (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Micrococcus luteus CIP5345 was from the Pasteur Institute collection (Paris, France). Studies of the MccE492m mechanism of action included a series of wild-type and mutant E. coli strains listed in Table I. Complementation of E. coli W3110-KP1344 (tonB–) was performed with the pMS7 plasmid (KanR, encoding TonB) (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B.

Similarly, complementation of E. coli C600 was performed with the pHX405 plasmid (AmpR, encoding FhuA) (22Moeck G.S. Letellier L. J.

Open table in a new tab Large Scale Purification of MccE492 and MccE492m—The microcin-producing strains E. coli VCS257 and E. coli C600 harboring the pJAM229 plasmid as well as K. pneumoniae RYC492 were grown for 16 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking in 2 liters of M63 minimum medium containing 0.25 g/liter MgSO4 and 1 mg/liter thiamine. Alternatively, glucose or trisodium citrate (0.25%) was used as a source of carbon, and casamino acids (Difco) or bactotryptone (BD Biosciences) was used at 1 g/liter as a source of amino acids. After cell removal by centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was loaded onto a Sep-Pak C8 cartridge (Waters) previously equilibrated with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2). The cartridge was washed once with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and three stepwise elutions were performed with 30, 35, and 40% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance was monitored at 226 nm, and the fractionation was performed at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. The 40% ACN Sep-Pak fraction was concentrated under vacuum (Rotavapor, Büchi Labortechnik) before being lyophilized. The lyophilized fraction was resuspended in 40% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and subjected to RP-HPLC on an analytical Inertsil ODS2 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Interchim, France). Isocratic elution with 39% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min allowed successive elution of MccE492 and MccE492m. Absorbance was monitored at 226 nm. Chymotrypsin Digestion and Isolation of the MccE492m-(74–84) Fragment—MccE492 or MccE492m (150 nmol) dissolved in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8) was digested with chymotrypsin (Sigma) at an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) for 90 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by acidification with glacial acetic acid, and samples were dried under vacuum (SpeedVac, Savant). The proteolytic fragments were separated on an Inertsil ODS2 column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm), with a linear gradient of 0–60% ACN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid over 90 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was monitored at 226 nm. SDS-PAGE—Purified MccE492 and MccE492m were loaded onto a 16.5% SDS-Tricine polyacrylamide gel (23Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) without boiling and detected by silver staining. The molecular weight marker was the ultra-low range color marker (Sigma). Amino Acid Composition and Microsequence Analysis—Peptides (0.5 nmol) were hydrolyzed under vacuum for 24 h at 110 °Cin6 m constant boiling HCl (Sigma). Separation by ion-exchange HPLC of the resulting amino acids and post-column derivatization with ninhydrin were performed as described previously (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Lyophilized purified samples (10 nmol) of MccE492 and MccE492m and of selected chymotrypsin digest fragments of MccE492 and MccE492m were resuspended in MilliQ™ water (Millipore) or methanol. Each sample was loaded and argon-dried on a Biobrene-coated filter and then subjected to N-terminal sequencing according to Edman degradation on a Procise 492 automatic protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Liquid Growth Inhibition Assay—Antibacterial assays were performed as described previously (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, serial dilutions of MccE492 or MccE492m (10 μl) were incubated in a 96-well microtiter plate with a 90-μl suspension of bacteria in midlogarithmic growth phase diluted in poor-broth nutrient medium (1% bactotryptone (BD Biosciences), 0.5% NaCl) to a starting absorbance of 0.001 at 620 nm. Inhibition of growth was determined by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm with a Ceres 900 microplate recorder (Bioteck Instruments) after a 16-h incubation at 30 °C. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were defined as the lowest concentrations that cause 100% growth inhibition and were determined in triplicate. Mass Spectrometry—The purified MccE492, MccE492m, and the chymotryptic peptides were analyzed for molecular mass determination by MALDI-TOF MS with a Voyager-de-Pro spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operating in the linear or reflectron mode with positive ion detection. Samples were loaded on matrix crystals obtained by rapid evaporation of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% ACN. The dry droplet method was chosen for target preparation. Bovine insulin (MH+ at m/z 5734.59), thioredoxin (MH+ at m/z 11674.48), and apomyoglobin (MH+ at m/z 16952.56) were used for calibration. Sequencing of the purified MccE492-(74–84) and MccE492m-(74–84) and analysis of the structure of the modification were performed by using hybrid ESI-Qq-TOF (Q-Star, Applied Biosystems) and nano-ESI-IT (ESQUIRE 3000, Bruker Daltonics) instruments operating in the positive and negative ion detection modes. Peptide samples (10 pmol/μl) were prepared in 50% ACN. Formic acid (0.5%) was added for positive ion mode analysis. In Fe3+/peptide binding experiments, a solution of FeCl3 was added to obtain metal to peptide ratios varying from 1:1 to 8:1. CID experiments (MS2 and MS3) were performed from selected ions submitted to resonant excitation amplitude from 0.5 to 1.5 VP-P. 2 μl of sample were loaded into Proxeon (Odense, Denmark) nano-electrospray tips. Accurate mass measurement was performed on the ESI-Qq-TOF instrument. Internal calibration was applied from the theoretical m/z ratio of identified b ions. The Roepstorff nomenclature (24Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar) was used to describe peptide fragmentations. NMR Spectroscopy—MccE492m-(74–84) was dissolved at a final 2.5 mm concentration either in CD3OH/H2O (50:50, v/v) or CD3OD/D2O (50:50, v/v). One- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 400 and DRX 800 spectrometers (Wissembourg, France) using a BBI probe and a TXI cryoprobe, respectively, both equipped with shielded gradients z. 1H and 13C chemical shifts were measured using the methanol methyl resonance as internal reference taken at 3.313 and 49.3 ppm, respectively. Conventional two-dimensional experiments 1H-1H double quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy, TOCSY (an 80-ms z-filtered DIPSI-2 sequence was used for Hartmann-Hahn mixing), incredible natural abundance double quantum transfer, NOESY (200 ms mixing time), as well as natural abundance 1H-13C HSQC (using adiabatic decoupling during acquisition) and HMBC (containing a low-pass filter) were performed for each sample. In both spectrometers, solvent suppression was obtained either by presaturation or by means of pulsed field gradients used in a water suppression by gradient tailored excitation scheme (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) or for coherence selection. Data were processed with the XWINNMR 3.1 software. Typically, matrixes were zero filled and forward linear prediction at the indirect dimension was applied prior to square sine bell apodization (shifted by π/3) and Fourier transformation. E. coli VCS257 harboring pJAM229 was grown in M63 minimal medium containing either glucose or citrate as a source of carbon and casamino acids or bactotryptone as a source of amino acids. No major difference in terms of antibacterial activity was observed upon carbon source replacement (data not shown), glucose thus being maintained for subsequent cultures. Conversely, significantly higher activities were detected in the supernatants of cultures using bactotryptone instead of the conventionally used casamino acids-supplemented medium (data not shown). This correlated with a much faster growth of the MccE492-producing strain in the bactotryptone-containing medium, as compared with the casamino acids strain (Fig. 1A). Therefore, when the cultures were stopped after a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, the bacteria were at the end and beginning of the exponential phase of growth, respectively. MccE492 was purified by RP-HPLC from both supernatants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified fractions were both active against E. coli ML35p. Surprisingly, although the microcin purified from the casamino acid-containing medium showed the expected electrophoretic behavior (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) on a silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 1B), the peptide issued from the bactotryptone-containing medium exhibited a higher apparent molecular mass (Fig. 1B). MALDI-TOF MS measurements showed that this peptide exhibited a molecular mass 831 Da higher (MH+ at m/z 8718) than the expected value (MH+ at m/z 7887) (Fig. 1C). Both peptides displayed an identical 37-residue N-terminal amino acid sequence by automatic Edman sequencing and a similar amino acid composition, with the exception of three extra serine residues in the higher molecular weight peptide (Table II). These results indicated the unknown peptide was a modified MccE492 bearing an 831-Da post-translational modification. It was consequently named MccE492m. Both the unmodified and modified peptides were obtained in high yield, using their optimized culture medium (2.1 mg/liter MccE492 and 9.5 mg/liter MccE492m for M63-casamino acids and M63-bactotryptone media, respectively). MccE492m was also purified from the culture supernatant of the wild-type K. pneumoniae RYC492 and was characterized by MALDI-TOF MS.Table IIAmino acid composition of MccE492, MccE492m, and their chymotryptic fragments MccE492-(74–84) and MccE492m-(74–84)Amino acidMccE492MccE492-(74-84)MccE492mMccE492m-(74-84)Asx10.01.110.11.1ThraValues corrected by extrapolation to zero time hydrolysis.3.91.03.91.0SeraValues corrected by extrapolation to zero time hydrolysis.9.86.012.68.9Glx4.24.2Pro6.06.0Gly19.02.119.12.1Ala9.81.09.91.1Val4.14.0Met0.90.9Ile3.03.0Leu9.19.0Tyr1.01.0His1.11.1TrpNDbND, not determined.NDa Values corrected by extrapolation to zero time hydrolysis.b ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab The antibacterial activity of MccE492m was compared with that of the unmodified microcin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Like MccE492, MccE492m was highly active against all the E. coli and the Salmonella enteritidis strains tested, with MIC values in the 40–80 nm range and at 150 nm, respectively (Table III). Moreover, MccE492m was 4–8 times more active than MccE492 against these strains. In addition, MccE492m was active against Enterobacter cloacae and K. pneumoniae, whereas no activity could be detected for the unmodified microcin in the range of 0.02–10 μm (Table III). As observed previously for MccE492 (9Destoumieux-Garzón D. Thomas X. Santamaria M. Goulard C. Barthelemy M. Boscher B. Bessin Y. Molle G. Pons A.M. Letellier L. Peduzzi J. Rebuffat S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), MccE492m was inactive in the same concentration range against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria not belonging to enterobacteria, such as Vibrio species. Therefore, MccE492m is a more potent antibacterial peptide than MccE492, characterized by a broader spectrum of activity against enterobacteria and by lower MICs.Table IIIComparative antibacterial activity of MccE492 and MccE492mMicroorganismsMICaMeasured in triplicate.MccE492MccE492mμmμmGram-negative bacteriaE. coli B0.300.04E. coli F0.300.08E. coli ML35p0.300.08S. enteritidis1.250.15E. cloacaeNAbNA, not active in the range of 0.02-10 μm.0.60K. pneumoniaeNA2.50Vibrio alginolyticusNANAVibrio harveyiNANAVibrio penaeicidaNANAGram-positive bacteriaM. luteus CIP5345NANAStaphylococcus aureusNANAStaphylococcus haemolyticusNANABacillus megateriumNANAa Measured in triplicate.b NA, not active in the range of 0.02-10 μm. Open table in a new tab In order to localize the modification in the MccE492 sequence, both MccE492 and MccE492m samples were subjected to chymotrypsin digestion. The RP-HPLCs of the resulting digests were identical (data not shown), with the exception of (i) one fast eluting peak present in the MccE492 digest exclusively, and (ii) a group of three slower eluting peaks observed in the MccE492m digest, which was absent from the MccE492 chromatogram. The MALDI-TOF and ESI-Qq-TOF mass spectra in positive mode of the corresponding fractions showed similar [M + H]+ ions at m/z 1772.6 and [M + 2H]2+ ions at m/z 886.8 for the three MccE492m-specific peaks, whereas the MccE492-specific peak led to an [M + H]+ ion at m/z 941.4, which appeared shifted to lower m/z ratios consistent with a mass difference of 831.2 Da (data not shown). An identical amino acid sequence (NSATSSSGSGS), corresponding to the 74–84 C-terminal residues of MccE492, was determined by Edman degradation for all the MccE492- and MccE492m-specific peptides. Because the three peaks in the MccE492m digest showed identical MS and Edman sequencing results, they were assumed to be three isomers or conformers. Therefore, further analyses were performed with the most abundant peptide form. The calculated mass for the 11-residue peptide sequence perfectly matched the 940.4-Da molecular mass determined for the MccE492-specific peptide, which was termed MccE492-(74–84). Because the molecular mass of the peptide isolated from the MccE492m digest (1771.6 Da) was 831.2 Da higher than that of MccE492-(74–84), it was deduced that the whole post-translational modification was carried by the 74–84 C-terminal peptide, which was named MccE492m-(74–84). CID of both MccE492-(74–84) and MccE492m-(74–84) was performed by ESI-MS in the positive ion mode (Fig. 2), generating two independent series of acylium (b-type) and ammonium (y-type) ions. The b ion series of both peptides, as well as the y ion series of MccE492-(74–84), unambiguously described the NSATSS-SGSGS sequence. By contrast, the MccE492m-(74–84) y ion series was shifted to upper m/z ratios consistent with a mass increase of 831.2 Da as compared with the MccE492-(74–84) y ion series (Fig. 2A). The ion at m/z 937.2, which is consistent with a protonated serine with an additional m/z ratio of 831.2, was attributed to the MccE492m-(74–84) y1 ion. The y2 to y8 ion series showed systematically this same shift in m/z ratio. Altogether, these results unambiguously indicated that the entire modification of MccE492m was carried by the microcin Ser-84 C-terminal residue. Characterization of a DHBS Trimer—In addition to the b- and y-type ion series observed as positive product ions, the CID spectrum of MccE492m-(74–84) obtained with the Qq-TOF instrument showed an intense ion at m/z 224, indicative of DHBS (data not shown) (26Berner I.

https://openalex.org/W2105149214,"Cyanobacteria contain several genes, annotated ndh, whose products show sequence similarities to subunits found in complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of eubacteria and mitochondria. However, it is still unclear whether the cyanobacterial ndh gene products actually form a single large protein complex or exist as smaller independent complexes. To address this, we have constructed a strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in which the C terminus of the NdhJ subunit was fused to an His6 tag to aid isolation. Three major NdhJ-containing complexes were resolved by blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with approximate apparent molecular masses of 460, 330, and 110 kDa. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry revealed that the 460-kDa complex contained ten annotated ndh gene products. Detergent-induced fragmentation experiments indicated that the 460-kDa complex was composed of hydrophobic (150 kDa) and hydrophilic (110–130 kDa) modules similar to that found in the minimal form of complex I found in Escherichia coli, except that the electron input module was not conserved. The difference in size between the 460- and 330-kDa complexes is attributed to differences in the stoichiometry of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic modules in the complex, either 2:1 or 1:1, respectively. We have also detected the presence of two new Ndh subunits (slr1623 and sll1262) that are unrelated to subunits in the eubacterial complex I but which have homologues in the closely related chloroplast Ndh complex of maize (Funk, E., Schäfer, E., and Steinmüller, K. (1999) J. Plant Physiol. 154, 16–23). The presence of these additional subunits might reflect the use by the NDH-1 and Ndh complexes of a different, so far unidentified, electron input module.

An interesting feature of cyanobacteria is that the thylakoid membrane contains both photosynthetic and respiratory complexes (1Ohkawa H. Sonoda M. Shibata M. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4938-4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Analysis of the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and other cyanobacteria has led to the hypothesis that it contains a type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, designated NDH-1, similar in function to complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) found in mitochondria and eubacteria (2Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar).Based on sequence comparisons, genes encoding 11 potential Ndh subunits have been identified in the Synechocystis 6803 genome (ndhA–K) (2Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). Evolutionary considerations suggest that complex I consists of three distinct structural elements or modules: an NADH-oxidizing sub-complex, an interconnecting hydrophilic fragment containing a number of Fe-S redox centers, and a hydrophobic membrane domain possibly involved in the pumping of protons (3Friedrich T. Weiss H. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 187: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). By analogy, the cyanobacterial ndh gene products could form the interconnecting hydrophilic fragment (NdhH, -I, -J, and -K) and the membrane domain (NdhA–F) (6Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) of a putative NDH-1 complex. However, Synechocystis, like the related Ndh complex in chloroplasts (7Nixon P.J. Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1541-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), does not have obvious homologues to the NuoE, -F, and -G subunits of Escherichia coli, which are responsible for binding and oxidizing NADH. It is possible that subunits of the bidirectional hydrogenase might act as substitutes (8Appel J. Schulz R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Schmitz O. Bothe H. Naturwissenschaften. 1996; 83: 525-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or that there might be a different type of electron input module, which may or may not oxidize NAD(P)H. Alternatively, the putative NDH-1 complex might act as a ferredoxin:plastoquinone oxidoreductase and lack a specific electron input module (6Friedrich T. Steinmüller K. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As yet the substrate specificity of the putative NDH-1 complex is unclear with NADH (10Berger S. Ellersiek U. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 286: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 11Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar), NADPH (11Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar, 12Matsuo M. Endo T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and reduced ferredoxin (11Mi H. Endo T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1995; 36: 661-668Google Scholar) all implicated.Most attention has so far focused on the construction and physiological characterization of various ndh mutants. For instance, the ndhB insertion mutant, M55, is impaired in dark respiration and shows slower rates of re-reduction of P700+, the oxidized primary electron donor of photosystem one, in the dark in intact cells (13Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Mi H. Endo T. Schreiber T. Ogawa T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 1233-1238Google Scholar). This has led to the assumption that a putative NDH-1 complex functions in respiration and cyclic electron flow around photosystem one by acting as a plastoquinone reductase. However, the impaired rates of plastoquinone reduction seen in the ndh mutants might actually be due to low levels of succinate in these strains, which limit the respiratory activity of the thylakoid succinate:plastoquinone oxidoreductase (15Cooley J.W. Vermaas W.F. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4251-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).The lack of a consistent phenotype for various ndh mutants has led to suggestions that there might be various types of NDH-1 complex in vivo each with different activities (16Badger M. Price G.D. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). For instance, although an ndhC insertion mutant can grow in air, ndhB and ndhK mutants require high levels of CO2 for growth (13Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4275-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Ogawa T. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1604-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the ndhH gene appears to be absolutely required for cell viability even at high concentrations of CO2 (18Pieulle L. Guedeney G. Cassier-Chauvat C. Jeanjean R. Chauvat F. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Some of the ndh genes are also found as multigene families. According to CyanoBase, there are six copies of the ndhD gene and three copies of the closely related ndhF gene (19Nakamura Y. Kaneko T. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tabata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies indicate that NdhD1 and NdhD2 are important for cyclic electron flow, whereas NdhD3/NdhF3 and NdhD4/NdhF4 are important for the inducible and constitutive transport, respectively, of inorganic carbon into the cell (20Klughammer B. Sültemeyer D. Badger M.R. Price G.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Ohkawa H. Pakrasi H.B. Ogawa T. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 11789-11794Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Whether the NdhD3/NdhF3 and NdhD4/NdhF4 subunits are part of larger NDH-1 complexes or exist as independent complexes is again unclear, although recent evidence supports the latter possibility (24Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A. Sirpiö S. Paakkarinen V. Aro E.-M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Attempts to isolate and characterize the subunit composition of the putative NDH-1 complex have so far met with little success. Only hydrophilic sub-complexes of various degrees of purity have been isolated (12Matsuo M. Endo T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Berger S. Ellersiek U. Kinzelt D. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Steinmüller and colleagues (25Berger S. Ellersiek U. Kinzelt D. Steinmüller K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) used antibodies raised against NdhK to immunoprecipitate an additional seven subunits from detergent-solubilized membrane extracts. N-terminal sequencing identified the presence of NdhH, NdhK, NdhI, and NdhJ. At the time the identity of the remaining subunits was unclear but comparison of their partial N-terminal sequences to the more recently acquired genome sequence now suggests that 21- and 18-kDa subunits are actually ribosomal proteins (L5 and L9, respectively) and that a 14-kDa subunit is encoded by the open reading frame slr1623. Given that the ribosomal proteins are presumably contaminants, it remains uncertain whether slr1623 is part of the NDH-1 complex.More recently a 380-kDa complex showing NADPH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity was isolated from Synechocystis 6803 (12Matsuo M. Endo T. Asada K. Plant Cell Physiol. 1998; 39: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE indicated the presence of at least nine protein bands with sizes ranging from 120 to 10 kDa. NdhH was found by immunoblotting to be present in the preparation, but the hydrophobic NdhA and NdhB subunits were absent. Although the NADPH:ferricyanide oxidoreductase activity was assumed to be due to the NDH-1 sub-complex, definitive evidence for this assignment was lacking.A major question that needs to be addressed, therefore, is whether the ndh gene products actually assemble into a large protein complex. Given current ideas on the modular evolution of complex I, it is conceivable that the ndh gene products could form distinct modules or sub-complexes that do not interact (4Friedrich T. Scheide D. FEBS Lett. 2000; 479: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 5Brandt U. Kerscher S. Dröse S. Zwicker K. Zickermann V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 545: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This is highlighted by recent studies that have suggested that the NdhB and NdhH subunits are differentially expressed (26Deng Y. Ye J. Mi H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and are not members of the same complex (18Pieulle L. Guedeney G. Cassier-Chauvat C. Jeanjean R. Chauvat F. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus the major aims of this work were to investigate whether the ndh gene products assemble into structural modules within a larger complex, and if so, whether there were additional hitherto unidentified Ndh subunits that might give clues to the nature of the electron input module.To help achieve these goals, we have generated a strain of Synechocystis 6803 in which the NdhJ subunit contains a His tag at its C terminus. The choice of the NdhJ subunit was guided by tagging experiments involving its closest relative in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (27Kashani-Poor N. Kerscher S. Zickermann V. Brandt U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A combination of anion-exchange chromatography and immobilized Ni-affinity chromatography plus blue native (BN-PAGE) 1The abbreviations used are: BN-PAGE, blue native PAGE; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; β-DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MS, mass spectrometry; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; WT, wild type. 1The abbreviations used are: BN-PAGE, blue native PAGE; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; β-DM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; MS, mass spectrometry; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; WT, wild type. has allowed us to characterize different NdhJ-containing complexes from Synechocystis 6803.Our results provide the first evidence that the Ndh subunits are indeed organized into hydrophobic and hydrophilic subcomplexes, as observed for other types of complex I, and do associate to form large complexes. Importantly we have identified two new Ndh subunits in Synechocystis 6803 that are not found in E. coli complex I. By comparison to earlier N-terminal sequence data, we conclude that closely related proteins found in higher plants are the first examples of nuclear-encoded components of the chloroplast Ndh complex. The module or subunit that feeds electrons into both types of complex still remains unclear. We discuss the possibility that it might be related to the electron input device found in archaebacterial coenzyme F420H2 dehydrogenases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of His-tagged NdhJ Strain—Overlap-extension PCR was used to insert a His6 tag at the C terminus of NdhJ (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). Primers used were ndhJfor (5′-GGG GGA TCC AGG ATA CCC GTA ACC CGG AAG-3′), ndhJrev (5′-GGG CTC GAG CAG CCA TCC TTC AAA ACC CGT-3′), Hisfor (5′-CAT CAC CAT CAC CAT CAC TAG TCC CGG TCG CAC ACG GCA AAA-3′), and Hisrev (5′-CTA GTG ATG GTG ATG GTG ATG ATA GGC ATC CTG GAG TTC-3′). Briefly, two DNA fragments were generated using Synechocystis 6803 genomic DNA as a template and the primer combinations ndhJfor/Hisrev and Hisfor/ndhJrev. The purified fragments were then used as templates in a new PCR reaction using primers ndhJfor and ndhJrev to amplify the final fused product, which was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, UK) to generate plasmid pNdhJ-His. Overall a 1.24-kb fragment was amplified extending from bases 1,876,591 to 1,877,809 of the genome sequence (2Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). A chloramphenicol-resistance cassette was inserted into a HincII site, 102 bp downstream of the stop codon of ndhJ, to generate plasmid pNdhJ-Hiscam. Plasmids were sequenced to confirm no unwanted base changes. The glucose-tolerant strain of Synechocystis 6803 was transformed with pNdhJ-Hiscam according to Ref. 29Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar, and chloramphenicolresistant colonies were analyzed by PCR to confirm incorporation of His-tagged ndhJ into the chromosome. One such strain, NdhJ-His, was used for isolation of the NDH-1 complex.Purification of the His-tagged NdhJ Preparation from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—Strain NdhJ-His was grown in BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm glucose at constant light (20 μmol.m–2.s–1) and with air bubbling (29Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Cultures (16 liters) were harvested in their exponential growth phase by centrifugation at 8,000 × g (JA21 rotor, BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice in 500 ml of washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaCl). The cells were broken by resuspending the pellet in 50 ml of washing buffer (containing 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm aminocaproic acid, 1 mm Pefabloc, and 50 μg/ml DNase) and by two consecutive passages through a French Press at 2,000 p.s.i. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 3,000 × g (JA14 rotor, BD Biosciences). The thylakoids were collected from the supernatant by centrifuging at 100,000 × g for 20 min (Ti-70 rotor, BD Biosciences), and the resulting thylakoid pellet was resuspended in UnoQ buffer (5 mm MgSO4, 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.03% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM)) to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll. Membranes were stored at –80 °C. Thylakoids were solubilized using β-DM (Calbiochem). A 10% (w/v) stock solution of β-DM in UnoQ buffer was added dropwise to the thylakoid membrane suspension (typically 20 mg of chlorophyll) at a chlorophyll concentration of 0.5 mg/ml to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v) β-DM and 0.45 mg/ml chlorophyll. This process was performed for 10 min in the dark at 4 °C with gentle stirring. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g (Ti-70 rotor, BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove unsolubilized membranes. The solubilized thylakoid extract was applied at a flow rate of 2 ml/min to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose™ High Performance (Amersham Biosciences) vertical column, previously equilibrated with UnoQ buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of UnoQ buffer, and the column was eluted with an MgSO4 gradient (5–200 mm) in the same buffer over 16 column volumes. The unbound fraction and the fractions containing the eluted protein were collected and kept at –80 °C for further analysis. Immunoblots revealed that NdhI and NdhJ were co-eluted, peaking at a salt concentration of ∼100 mm MgSO4. His-tagged NdhJ was purified by affinity chromatography using Ni2+-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen). Ni2+-NTA-agarose was incubated with Binding Buffer (20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 60 mm MgSO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2, 25% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.03% (w/v) β-DM). Pooled fractions from the Q-Sepharose column (∼40 ml) were added to the column material, and binding was achieved by mixing in a 50-ml tube (using a rotator mixer) at 4 °C for 2 h. Approximately 0.3 ml of resin was used per milliliter of pooled fraction. The column material was resettled and washed with Binding Buffer containing imidazole (5 and 10 mm) to remove weakly bound proteins. The His-tagged NdhJ protein was eluted using Binding Buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The purified proteins were then diluted 50-fold with Binding Buffer to reduce the imidazole concentration and concentrated using Amicon® Ultra-15 units (100-kDa molecular mass cut-off) and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, and chlorophyll was determined according to a previous study (30Wellburn A.R. Lichtenthaler H. Sybesma C. Advances in Photosynthesis Research. II. Nijhoff/Junk, The Hague1984: 9-12Google Scholar). Approximately 1.5 mg of the final His-tagged NdhJ preparation was obtained from 250 mg of thylakoid protein.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were electrophoresed through 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels fused to a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel, using a Tris-Tricine buffer system (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). Pre-stained and unstained protein markers were purchased from Bio-Rad Ltd. UK and Invitrogen, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (32Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) using the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate detection system (Pierce Biotechnology, Perbio Science Ltd., UK). Antibodies specific for NdhI and NdhJ are described in a previous study (32Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Anti-peptide antibodies specific for NdhF3 are described in a previous study (24Herranen M. Battchikova N. Zhang P. Graf A.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and were kindly made available by Professor Eva-Mari Aro (University of Turku, Finland). Silver staining was performed according to a previous study (33Blum H. Beier H. Gross H. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar).N-terminal Protein Sequencing—The samples for protein sequencing were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad Ltd., UK) according to a previous study (34Dunn S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The membrane was washed three times with water and stained with 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R250 in 40% (v/v) methanol/H2O. The membrane was destained in 50% (v/v) methanol/H2O and dried. The protein spots of interest were cut out and sequenced by Dr. Jeff Keen at the School of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Leeds using the Edman degradation method.Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry and Data Analysis— Samples for tandem mass spectrometry were prepared by tryptic in-gel digestion of excised protein bands/spots according to a previous study (35Mortz E. Vorm O. Mann M. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 23: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The samples were dried and stored at –80 °C until further use. For MS/MS analysis the dried samples were diluted in 10 μl of buffer A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, 95% (v/v) water) and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant (5 μl) was transferred into an autosampling vial. Analyte sampling, chromatography, and production and acquisition of MS/MS data were performed on line using fully automated instrumentation as described in a previous study (36Stauber E. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Double distilled water and HPLC-grade solvents were used throughout the procedure. Analyses of MS/MS data were performed with the Finnigan Sequest/Turbo Sequest software (Rev. 2.0 ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) using the parameters described in a previous study (36Stauber E. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For MS/MS data evaluation, the Synechocystis data base from Kazusa (available at ftp.kazusa.or.jp/pub/cyanobase/Synechocystis) was downloaded (on October 27, 2003) and used.Blue Native (BN)-PAGE—BN-PAGE through 5–15% (w/v) gradient gels was performed according to a previous study (37Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). For analysis of the His-tagged NdhJ preparation, 2 μl of a Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) G-250 stock solution (5% (w/v) in 500 mm aminocaproic acid) was added to 30 μl of sample, containing ∼25 μg of total protein, in Binding Buffer. For analysis of thylakoid membranes in Fig. 2c, 30 μl of thylakoid membranes, at 0.5 mg/ml chlorophyll in UnoQ buffer, were solubilized by addition of a 10% (w/v) β-DM in UnoQ buffer to give a final concentration of 1% (w/v). The sample was left on ice for 10 min, then unsolubilized membranes were removed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Just prior to BN-PAGE, CBB G-250 was added from a 5% (w/v) stock in 500 mm aminocaproic acid to give a detergent/Coomassie ratio of 4:1 (w/w). For analysis of solubilized thylakoid extracts the cathode buffer contained 0.02% (w/v) CBB G-250, whereas for the NDH-1 preparation, a concentration of 0.002% (w/v) was used. Protein markers used to calibrate the gel were: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (69 kDa). For denaturing electrophoresis in the second dimension, a lane from a blue-native gel was incubated at room temperature in 1% (w/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h, briefly washed twice with water to remove excess β-mercaptoethanol, then placed on top of a 12% (w/v) gel for SDS-PAGE using a Tricine buffer system (31Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). In the case of Fig. 2d, thylakoids were prepared and analyzed by BN-PAGE as described in a previous study (38Tichý M. Lupínková L. Sicora C. Vass I. Kuviková S. Prášil O. Komenda J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1605: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Fragmentation of NDH-1 complexes was accomplished using similar conditions to a previous study (39Holt P.J. Morgan D.J. Sazanov L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43114-43120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly 30 μl of the His-tagged NdhJ sample in Binding Buffer was adjusted to pH 7.5 using HCl and made 0.3 m in NaCl. Triton X-100 was then added from a 10% (v/v) stock solution in Binding Buffer to give a final concentration of 0.15% (v/v). The sample was left on ice for 10 min, then analyzed by BN-PAGE as described above.NADH and NADPH Dehydrogenase Assays—NADH and NADPH: ferricyanide (FeCN) oxidoreductase activities were assayed at room temperature according to a previous study (40Galante Y.M. Hatefi Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The decrease in absorbance at 420 nm was assumed to be due to reduction of FeCN. A Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer was used for all measurements. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) β-DM, 0.1 mm NADH or NADPH, and 0.5 mm FeCN.Bioinformatic Tools—Searches for similar sequences were performed using BLAST programs (41Altschul S.F.

Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). The following databases were consulted: The Institute for Genomic Research at www.tigr.org/tdb/, The Arabidopsis Information Resource at www.arabidopsis.org/index.jsp, and CyanoBase at www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Synechocystis/index.html.RESULTSIsolation of His-tagged NdhJ Preparation—Strain NdhJ-His was constructed by overlap extension PCR so that a His6 tag was fused to the C terminus of the NdhJ subunit, which is predicted to be a subunit in the interconnecting fragment linking the electron input module to the membrane module (“Experimental Procedures”). Preliminary experiments indicated that Ni-NTA chromatography of a β-DM-solubilized thylakoid membrane extract led to considerable contamination of the NdhJ preparation (data not shown). To help reduce this contamination, the solubilized thylakoid extract was first subjected to anion-exchange chromatography, and pooled fractions containing NdhJ were then purified by Ni-NTA chromatography using imidazole to elute bound NdhJ-containing complexes (“Experimental Procedures”). As the immunoblotting experiment in Fig. 1 shows, both His-tagged NdhJ and the NdhI subunit, which is also predicted"
https://openalex.org/W2068022034,"Dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R/D3R), which have similar structural architecture as well as functional similarities, are expressed in the same brain dopaminergic neurons. It is intriguing that two receptor proteins with virtually the same functional roles are expressed in the same neuron. Recently we have shown that D2R and D3R possess different regulatory processes including intracellular trafficking properties, which implies that they might employ different signaling mechanisms for regulation of the same cellular processes. Here we studied the signaling pathways of ERK activation mediated by D2R and D3R in HEK-293 cells and corroborated them with concomitant studies in COS-7 cells and C6 cells. Our results show that Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and atypical protein kinase C were commonly involved in D2R-/D3R-mediated ERK activation. However, β-arrestin and sequestration of D2R/D3R were found not to be involved. ERK activations mediated by D3R, but not D2R, were blocked by βARK-CT, AG1478 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, and by dominant negative mutants of Ras and Raf, suggesting the involvement of the Gβγi pathway. The α-subunit of Go (Gαo) was able to couple with D3R to mediate ERK activation. We conclude that D3R mainly utilizes the βγ pathway of Gi protein, which involves the transactivation of EGFR in HEK-293 cells. In contrast, the α-subunit of the Gi protein plays a main role in D2R-mediated ERK activation. Our study suggests one example of intricate cellular regulations in the brain, that is, dopaminergic neurons could regulate ERK activity more flexibly through alternative usage of either the D2R or D3R pathway depending on the cellular situation.

Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PKC, protein kinase C; PI, phosphatidylinositol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PTX, pertussis toxin; PLC, phospholipase C; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. and ERK2 (p44ERK and p42ERK) are key cellular components that control cell proliferation and differentiation (1Gutkind J.S. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The regulation of ERK through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a complicated process. Various signaling components play different roles in ERK activation depending on the GPCR and cell types involved (2Lefkowitz R.J. Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There has been substantial progress in the understanding of cellular events that link the activation of GPCR and ERK (for review, see Ref. 1Gutkind J.S. Sci. STKE. 2000; 2000: RE1Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These signaling events can be classified into several distinct pathways. They include: (i) Ras-dependent activation of ERK via transactivation of receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR, (ii) Ras-independent ERK activation via protein kinase C (PKC) that converges with RTK signaling at the Raf level (iii) activation or inhibition of ERK via the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, in which the direction of regulation depends on the type of Raf involved, and (iv) the recently substantiated β-arrestin-mediated pathway proven in certain classes of GPCRs (3Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, it should be mentioned that these signaling pathways are deduced from the limited sets of individual receptors or cell types, and more extensive and systemic studies are needed for these signaling models to be generalized (4Liebmann C. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Brain dopamine receptors differ in their pharmacological profiles and in brain distribution. Based on their structural, pharmacological, and functional characteristics, the dopamine receptors have been classified into two pharmacological subfamilies: D1- and D2-like dopamine receptors. With the advent of molecular biological techniques, the D1-like receptors were subdivided into the D1 and D5 receptors, while the D2, D3, and D4 receptors comprise the D2-like receptors. Among all the dopamine receptor subtypes characterized, it is generally accepted that D2R and D3R are related to schizophrenia. Possibly because of high similarity in their amino acid composition (46% overall amino acid homology and 78% identity in the transmembrane domains) (5Giros B. Martres M.P. Sokoloff P. Schwartz J.C. C. R. Acad. Sci. III. 1990; 311: 501-508PubMed Google Scholar), D2R and D3R share most signaling pathways such as adenylyl cyclase, extracellular acidification, mitogenesis, ERK activation, inhibition of dopamine synthesis, and ion channel regulation (K+, Ca2+) (for review, see Ref. 6Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies show that although D3R is more densely expressed in the limbic area, mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons express both D2R and D3R (7Sokoloff P. Giros B. Martres M.P. Bouthenet M.L. Schwartz J.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (2425) Google Scholar, 8Diaz J. Pilon C. Le Foll B. Gros C. Triller A. Schwartz J.C. Sokoloff P. J.

Because D2R and D3R are virtually the same in functional aspect and are expressed in the same cells, it can be speculated that signaling routes or regulatory mechanisms for functions of effectors could be different. To address this issue, we decided to focus on a specific cellular function and conduct a detailed study on signaling mechanisms in order to see if their signaling or regulatory pathways differ. ERK activation was selected as a model experimental system, because GPCR-mediated ERK regulation consists of multiple complex steps, which are relatively well established. D2R-mediated ERK activation has been reported from different cell types. It is pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and partially blocked by the dominant negative mutant of Ras, N17Ras, in C6 cells (10Luo Y. Kokkonen G.C. Wang X. Neve K.A. Roth G.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 980-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and CHO cells (11Welsh G.I. Hall D.A. Warnes A. Strange P.G. Proud C.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is involved in CHO cells, where the platelet-derived growth factor receptor mediates this through a pathway other than the Gβγ pathway (11Welsh G.I. Hall D.A. Warnes A. Strange P.G. Proud C.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2139-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Oak J.N. Lavine N. Van Tol H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Even though molecular details are not yet characterized, it has been reported in CHO cells that the D3R-mediated ERK activation, which involves the same signaling pathways as D2R, is PTX-sensitive, and PI 3-kinase and atypical PKC are involved (13Cussac D. Newman-Tancredi A. Pasteau V. Millan M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, there has not been a single comparative study for signaling mechanisms addressing differences in the D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation in the same cell type. Considering that signaling of GPCR-mediated ERK activation could greatly vary depending on the cell types involved, it is necessary to conduct well controlled comparative studies of D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation in the same cell type to understand the details of the signaling mechanism. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which D2R and D3R activates ERK1/2, side by side in the same cell types. In this regard, we designed our experiments to determine: (i) which isotype of G proteins are involved in these processes, (ii) the putative signaling mediators involved using various specific inhibitors and dominant negative mutants, (iii) whether internalization of D2R or D3R is a prerequisite for activation of ERK1/2, (iv) whether transactivation with receptor-tyrosine kinase is involved in the activation of ERK1/2, (v) whether β-arrestin plays a role in ERK activation, and (vi) whether D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation accompany the internalization of EGFR.

Bunnett (University of California at San Francisco), and EGFR-GFP was from A. Sorkin (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center). Dominant negative p21Ras, RasN17, was from Drs. D. Aultschuler and M. Ostrowski (University of Ohio). Sos-Pro was from Dr. R. J. Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center). Dominant negative p74Raf-1, ΔNRaf was from Dr. L. T. Williams (University of San Francisco). The cDNA of pertussis toxin-insensitive C351I-Gαo was provided by Dr. De Vries (Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre). ERK Measurement—After transfection, cells were cultured in 6-well plates. If necessary, they were starved overnight in a serum-free culture medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were treated with dopamine dissolved in 10 μm ascorbic acid, medium was aspirated, and SDS sample buffer was directly added to culture wells. After incubating 20 min at 65 °C, samples were sonicated to shear genomic DNA. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% running gel, 5% stacking gel) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk or 4% BSA, followed by 1 h of incubation with antibodies to phospho-ERK (1:1,000 dilution) and 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000) in 2% nonfat dry milk. Blots were visualized with chemiluminescent Western blotting kit. The same samples were processed as in phospho-ERK detection except that the membranes were probed with antibodies for ERK. Immunocytochemistry—The same experimental procedures were used as previously reported (Tohgo et al., Ref. 45Tohgo A. Pierce K.L. Choy E.W. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9429-9436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For the co-localization studies between β-arrestin and phospho-ERK, HEK-293 cells transiently expressing D2R or D3R and β-arrestin 2-GFP were grown in collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (confocal dishes). Following dopamine stimulation for 5 min, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with absolute methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA, 5% fetal bovine serum for 2 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescent labeling of endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 was done with a 1:500 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% BSA, 1% fetal bovine serum for 18 h at room temperature, followed by a 1:500 dilution Texas Red®-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG antibody in 1% BSA, 1% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope dual line switching excitation (488 nm for GFP and 568 nm for Texas Red®) and emission (515–540 nm for GFP and 590–620 nm for Texas Red®) filter sets. EGFR Sequestration Assay Using Confocal Microscopy—HEK-293 cells were transfected with the EGFR-GFP with or without D2R or D3R. One day after transfection, cells were seeded onto confocal dishes and allowed to recover for 1 day. Cells were treated either with 10 ng/ml EGF or 1 μm dopamine for 30 min in 2 ml of MEM containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and viewed on a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope. Receptor Sequestration Assay—Three different strategies were used as described previously (18Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Characterization of D2R- and D3R-mediated Activation of ERK1/2 in HEK-293 Cells—The time course and dose response relationship of D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation were studied in HEK-293 cells, which were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding D2R or D3R (because D2SR was mainly used in this study, D2R refers to D2SR unless specified). As shown in Fig. 1, the phosphorylation of p44 and p42 forms of ERK (ERK1/2) was transient and dose-dependent. It reached a maximum at 1 μm dopamine at around 5 min, returning to basal levels after 30 min. Pretreatment of cells with haloperidol (10 μm) or sulpiride (10 μm, data not shown) abolished both D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that the activation of ERK1/2 is truly mediated by D2RorD3R (Fig. 1C). Involvement of PTX-sensitive G Protein in the D2R- and D3R-mediated Activation of ERK—Although D2R and D3R couple to PTX-sensitive G proteins for the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, it is possible that GPCRs could couple to different G proteins for different effector proteins. For example, the β2-adrenergic receptor couples to Gs to activate adenylyl cyclase but couples to Gi for the activation of ERK in HEK-293 cells (20Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). PTX is known to catalyze ADP-ribosylation of α-subunits in the Gi and Go subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins, and this covalent modification prevents the Gi/o proteins from interacting with receptors (21Stryer L. Bourne H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 391-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 22Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). Overnight treatment with PTX (100 ng/ml) completely blocked the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, suggesting the involvement of Gi and/or Go proteins in D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained from transiently transfected COS-7 cells and C6 cells that stably express D2LR or D3R (data not shown). It has been reported that both D2R and D3R couple with Go. Co-expression of the α-subunit of Go (Gαo) increased the G protein coupling of D2R and D3R about six times (data not shown), suggesting that both receptors could effectively couple to Go. To test whether Gi or Go is involved in the activation of ERK, the PTX-insensitive Gα-subunit, Gαo-C351I (23Diverse-Pierluissi M.A. Fischer T. Jordan J.D. Schiff M. Ortiz D.F. Farquhar M.G. De Vries L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14490-14494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), was co-expressed and tested for ERK activation. D3R-mediated ERK activation from the cells co-transfected with Gαo-C351I was less effectively blocked by PTX treatment than ERK activation from cells not expressing Gαo-C351I (lower two panels in Fig. 2, B1, compare lane 3 versus 4 and 7 versus 8; also see Fig. 2, B2), suggesting the involvement of Gαo for ERK activation. On the other hand, the PTX sensitivity of D2R-mediated ERK activation was not significantly altered by co-expression of C351I-Gαo (upper two panels in Fig. 2, B1, compare lane 3 versus 4 and 7 versus 8; also see Fig. 2, B2). These results suggest that even though Go is able to couple to both D2R and D3R effectively, D2R mediates ERK activation mainly through the Gi protein, whereas both Gi and Go could mediate ERK activation by D3R in HEK-293 cells. The involvement of βγ-subunits of G proteins in the activation of ERK has been reported for various GPCRs including D2R in CHO cells (24Choi E.Y. Jeong D. Won K. Park Baik J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The carboxy terminus of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1-CT) contains the binding domain for Gβγ, which has allowed βARK1-CT to be used to distinguish the Gα and Gβγ signaling pathways (25Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, C1, phosphorylation of co-expressed GFP-ERK2 (upper panel) was effectively attenuated by βARK1-CT in cells expressing D3R but not in cells expressing D2R (compare lane 1 versus 2 and 3 versus 4 for D2R; lane 5 versus 6 and 7 versus 8 for D3R). Statistical analyses of these results are shown in Fig. 2, C2. Receptor Sequestration Is Not a Requirement for ERK Activation by D2R and D3R—Recently, it has been suggested for certain GPCRs that receptor internalization may be required for the activation of the ERK cascades under certain conditions (26Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Della Rocca G.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31648-31656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). On the other hand, receptor sequestration is not necessary for ERK activation of some GPCRs (28DeGraff J.L. Gagnon A.W. Benovic J.L. Orsini M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11253-11259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We wanted to test whether receptor internalization is required for D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation. We examined the relationship between receptor internalization and ERK activation by blocking receptor internalization using dynamin dominant negative mutant K44A and sucrose. In addition, we modulated the receptor sequestration by co-expressing GRK/β-arrestins, and tested their effect on ERK activation. Dynamin is a critical component involved in the clathrincoated pit formation. It pinches off vesicles from the plasma membrane, and inhibition of this process by K44A blocks receptor internalization (29van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A1, in HEK-293 cells, D2R sequestered about 8% in response to agonist treatment (10 μm, 1 h), and this was potentiated by a co-expression of GRK2 up to 23%. Co-expression of the dominant negative V53D β-arrestin 1 or dynamin I K44A reduced the sequestration of D2R, suggesting that D2R sequesters in a clathrin-dependent manner. In COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, B1), sequestration of D2R did not occur in the absence of GRK or β-arrestin but could be increased with the co-expression of β-arrestin 2 up to 12.6 ± 1.2% for the short splice variant (D2SR) and 22.4 ± 3.2% for the long splice variant (D2LR) (data not shown). Co-expression of GRK3/β-arrestin 2 increased the sequestration up to 39 and 54% for D2SR and D2LR, and dynamin I K44A significantly blocked the sequestration of both splice variants of D2R (Fig. 3, B1). On the other hand, D3R sequestered less than 10% in both HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells, only in the presence of exogenous GRK (18Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). ERK activation was still observed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, B2, lanes 2 and 6) in which D2R or D3R does not undergo agonist-induced receptor sequestration (Fig. 3, B1, Mock). In addition, D2R- or D3R-induced ERK activation was not significantly reduced by co-expression of dynamin I K44A (lane 2 versus 4 and lane 6 versus 8 in Fig. 3, A2 and B2). This was further confirmed by HEK-293 cells that were treated with sucrose (Fig. 3, A3), which is one of the nonspecific but strong inhibitors of receptor sequestration. Sucrose treatment did not affect D2R- or D3R-mediated ERK activation (lane 2 versus 3 and lane 5 versus 6). These results suggest overall that agonist-induced receptor sequestration of D2R or D3R is not the main determinant for ERK activation. Roles of Phospholipase C and Protein Kinase C in the D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK Activation—In HEK-293 cells, one or more isoforms of PLC are involved in the α1B-AR- and α2A-AR-mediated ERK activation via the Gβγ-subunit (30Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19125-19132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which induces the activation of protein kinase C and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. These second messengers subsequently activate a number of cellular processes leading to the modification of cell proliferation and differentiation (31Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1984; 312: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (4254) Google Scholar). There have been studies that showed the regulation of inositol phosphate production by D2-like receptors (32Pizzi M. D'Agostini F. Da Prada M. Spano P.F. Haefely W.E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1987; 136: 263-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 33Rasolonjanahary R. Gerard C. Dufour M.N. Homburger V. Enjalbert A. Guillon G. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and we tested whether PLC activation was required for D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK phosphorylation using the pharmacological PLC inhibitor, U-73122. As shown in Fig. 4A, U-73122, did not have a significant effect on D2R- and D3R-mediated activation of ERK (compare lane 3 versus 5 and lane 8 versus 10). The involvement of PKC in D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation was tested by either depletion of endogenous PKC by overnight pretreatment with phorbol ester (PMA, 1 μm) or by treatment with specific PKC inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4B, overnight PMA treatment abolished the subsequent activation of ERK by PMA (30-min treatment), suggesting that PKC depletion was successful. However, D2R- or D3R-mediated ERK activation was not affected by overnight PMA treatment (Fig. 4B, left and right panels, compare lanes 1 and 2 versus lanes 5 and 6), and an additional 30-min PMA treatment did not overshadow agonist effects (compare lanes 5 and 6 versus 7 and 8). These results exclude the involvement of PMA-sensitive PKCs in the D2R- or D3R-mediated activation of ERK. This was further confirmed by studies using the PKC inhibitors, Gö6976 and Gö6983 (34Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Gö6983, which inhibits the atypical PKC isoform (aPKC) PKC-ζ (IC50, 60 nm), blocked both D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activations (Fig. 4C, left and right panels, lanes 6–8). In contrast, Gö6976, which inhibits typical PKCs did not have any effect at 5 μm (Fig. 4C, left and right panels, lanes 3–5). Together, these results suggest that PMA-insensitive atypical PKCs are involved in the D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK activation, which is characteristic of ERK activation mediated by Gi but not Go (36van Biesen T.

Also it is known that PKC-ζ directly phosphorylates and activates MEK (37Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Dent P. Lozano J. Municio M.M. Berra E. Hay R.T. Sturgill T.W. Moscat J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Roles of PI 3-Kinase and Src in D2R- and D3R-mediated ERK Activation—It is known that the atypical PKC subtype, PKC-ζ, is activated by PIP3 and PIP2 (39Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are products of PI 3-kinase. We next determined the involvement of PI 3-kinase on D2R- and D3R-mediated activation of ERK because D2R and D3R may mediate aPKC activation through PI 3-kinase. Wortmannin blocked both D2R- and D3R-induced ERK activations in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). These results agree with the signaling of other receptors, such as Gi-coupled LPA receptor, which activates ERK through PI 3-kinase/atypical PKC in CHO cells (40Takeda H. Matozaki T. Takada T. Noguchi T. Yamao T. Tsuda M. Ochi F. Fukunaga K. Inagaki K. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 386-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Src is a cytosolic tyrosine kinase that is involved in the initiation of receptor-tyrosine kinase activation. Src is activated by interaction with Ca2+-dependent kinase, Pyk2 (related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase), which is identified as a component of the Gi/o-coupled receptor pathway in ERK activation (41Dikic I. Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Obermeier A."
https://openalex.org/W2111999563,"In response to certain cytokines and inflammatory mediators, the activity of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase enzyme is primed for enhanced superoxide production when the cells receive a subsequent oxidase-activating stimulus. The relative role of p38 MAPK in the priming and activation processes is incompletely understood. We have developed a 2-step assay that allows the relative contributions of p38 MAPK activity in priming to be distinguished from those involved in oxidase activation. Using this assay, together with in vitro kinase assays and immunochemical studies, we report that p38 MAPK plays a critical role in TNFalpha priming of the human and porcine NADPH oxidase for superoxide production in response to complement-opsonized zymosan (OpZ), but little, if any, role in neutrophil priming by platelet-activating factor (PAF) for OpZ-dependent responses. The OpZ-mediated activation process per se is independent of p38 MAPK activity, in contrast to oxidase activation by fMLP, where 70% of the response is eliminated by p38 MAPK inhibitors regardless of the priming agent. We further report that incubation of neutrophils with TNFalpha results in the p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of a subpopulation of p47(phox) and p67(phox) molecules, whereas PAF priming results in phosphorylation only of p67(phox). Despite these phosphorylations, TNFalpha priming does not result in significant association of either of these oxidase subunits with neutrophil membranes, demonstrating that the molecular basis for priming does not appear to involve preassembly of the NADPH oxidase holoenzyme/cytochrome complex prior to oxidase activation."
https://openalex.org/W1965650841,"In response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, cells launch homeostatic and protective responses, but can also activate cell death cascades. A 54 kDa integral ER membrane protein called Herp was identified as a stress-responsive protein in non-neuronal cells. We report that Herp is present in neurons in the developing and adult brain, and that it is regulated in neurons by ER stress; sublethal levels of ER stress increase Herp levels, whereas higher doses decrease Herp levels and induce apoptosis. The decrease in Herp protein levels following a lethal ER stress occurs prior to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death, and is mediated by caspases which generate a 30-kDa proteolytic Herp fragment. Mutagenesis of the caspase cleavage site in Herp enhances its neuroprotective function during ER stress. While suppression of Herp induction by RNA interference sensitizes neural cells to apoptosis induced by ER stress, overexpression of Herp promotes survival by a mechanism involving stabilization of ER Ca2+ levels, preservation of mitochondrial function and suppression of caspase 3 activation. ER stress-induced activation of JNK/c-Jun and caspase 12 are reduced by Herp, whereas induction of major ER chaperones is unaffected. Herp prevents ER Ca2+ overload under conditions of ER stress and agonist-induced ER Ca2+ release is attenuated by Herp suggesting a role for Herp in regulating neuronal Ca2+ signaling. By stabilizing ER Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial functions, Herp serves a neuroprotective function under conditions of ER stress.

Various conditions, including oxidative and metabolic stress and Ca2+ overload can interfere with ER functions leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins. Cells sense and respond to such ER stress by activating a signaling cascade termed the unfolded protein response, which results in the transcriptional up-regulation of stress proteins including members of the glucose-regulated protein (grp) family and other protein chaperones (calnexin, calreticulin, ERp72) that enhance the protein folding capability of the ER (1Patil C. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). ER stress has been documented in neurons in a variety of acute pathological conditions including cerebral ischemia and severe epileptic seizures (2Paschen W. Frandsen A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). However, despite the fact that disruption of cellular Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to the death of neurons in these conditions, it is not known how molecular responses to ER stress modify cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the cell death process. Studies of cultured cells suggest that ER stress can stimulate the expression of cytoprotective genes such as protein chaperones (3Yu Z. Luo H. Fu W. Mattson M.P. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 155: 302-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) but may also trigger a form of programmed cell death called apoptosis (4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat.

A better understanding of ER stress and its links to cell survival/death decisions is therefore needed. Recent findings suggest that ER stress is also implicated in several chronic neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's (5Katayama T. Imaizumi K. Sato N. Miyoshi K. Kudo T. Hitomi J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A novel 54 kDa protein called Herp (homocysteine-induced ER protein) was recently identified and characterized as a stress-responsive protein localized in the ER membrane; Herp contains a ubiquitin-like domain and resembles the human DNA excision repair protein hHR23 (13Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The function of Herp is unknown. Sai et al. (14Sai X. Kawamura Y.

Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler E. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In the present study we demonstrate a role for Herp in stabilizing cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and preventing neuronal death following ER stress. Neuronal Cell Cultures—Hippocampal and cortical cell cultures were established from 18 day Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described previously (16Mattson M.P. Barger S.W. Begley J.G. Mark R.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 187-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Briefly, intact hippocampi and neocortical fragments were trypsinized, and cells were dissociated by mild trituration using a Pasteur pipette with a fire-polished tip. Cells were seeded into polyethyleneimine-coated plastic 35- or 60-mm diameter plastic dishes or 22 mm2 glass coverslips, and maintained at 37 °C in Neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplements (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.001% gentamycin sulfate and 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). All experiments were performed using 7–8-day-old cultures; greater than 90% of the cells in these cultures were neurons. Generation of DNA Constructs and Stably Transfected PC12 Cell Lines—Plasmids containing the full-length human Herp cDNA or full-length human Herp with an N-terminal c-Myc tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag were constructed as described previously (13Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate by a PCR-based primer overlap extension method. In brief, same pair of flanking primers and two different mutant overlapping primers were synthesized. The flanking primers are 5′-CGCGGATCCTTTTTTAAAATGGAGTCCGAGACC-3′(forward) and 5′-CCGGAATTCTCAGTTTGCGATGG-3′(reverse) (the start and stop codons are underlined). To produce the mutant Herp D266E construct the overlapping mutant primers were 5′-AATCGAGATTGGTTGGAATGG-3′(forward) and 5′-TCCATTCCAACCAATCTCGATTTA-3′ (reverse). The PCR products that contained the mutant sequence were subcloned into the PCR4 TOPO TA cloning vector (Stratagene), which was then amplified and digested with BamHI and EcoRII and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer). Transfection of PC12 cells was carried out using the LipofectAMINE reagent using the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Stably expressing clones were obtained after selection for growth in the presence of geneticin (500 mg/liter) and characterized for Herp expression by immunoblot analysis. Experimental Treatments—To induce ER stress, undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, homocysteine, or 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) for various time points as indicated. At the end of each treatment, cultures were processed for biochemical analyses of levels of cytoplasmic and ER stress proteins, and for evaluating the extent of cell death. The caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Bio-Mol) was prepared as a 500× stock in dimethyl sulfoxide. Amyloid β-peptide-(1–42) (Bachem) was prepared as a 1 mm stock in water, which was incubated overnight at room temperature prior to dilution into culture medium. siRNA Preparation and Nucleofection—Several 19-base pair (bp) sequences were selected from the rat Herp sequence and synthesized with an additional 2-bp overhang using the siRNA Construction kit (Ambion). siRNA duplexes targeting Herp (siRNAHerp) were prepared as described. Briefly, 100 nm sense primers (5′-AAACAACCGGCTCTTCGTCdTdT-3′ for siRNAHerp1;5′-AAUCCUGACUUCCGGGAAAdTdT-3′ for siRNAHerp2; 5′-AAUCCUGACUUCCGGGAAAdTdT-3′ for siRNAHerp3) and corresponding antisense primers were mixed in 50 μl of water with 5 μlof10× annealing buffer (0.1 m potassium acetate, 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 2 mm magnesium acetate). The mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to 25 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. The siRNA duplexes were diluted in RNase-free water and stored at -80 °C in multiple aliquots. Non-silencing control siRNA duplexes (siRNACTRL) were synthesized using scrambled sequences as described above. GenBank™ search revealed no other known genes exhibiting sequence homology to these selected target sequences. After thorough mixing of the cells and 0.5–1 μg of siRNA duplexes, transfection was immediately carried out using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V according to Amaxa's optimized protocol for PC12 cells. Mock-transfected cells were nucleofected with vehicle (water). RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from primary neuronal cultures using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 2 μg of RNA was used for synthesis of cDNA using random primers and a first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). 200 ng of the cDNA was used in the PCR reaction using the following pairs of primers: Herp 5′-GAAGAAGATGAAATAAATCGAGAT-3′(forward) and 5′-TCAGTTTGCGATGGCTGGGGGG-3′ (reverse); β-actin 5′-TGTGATGGACTCCGGTGACGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACAGCTTCTCTTTGATGTCACGC-3′ (reverse). The optimized PCR conditions were 2 min at 94 °C, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized using a Fuji 3000 PhosphorImager. Immunoblot Analysis—Methods for protein quantitation, electrophoretic separation, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes were as described previously (17Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated in blocking solution (5% milk in Tween Tris-buffered saline; TTBS) overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h in secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and bands were visualized using a chemiluminiscence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies included: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Grp78, Grp94, and Hsp60 (StressGen), β-tubulin, and α-actin (Sigma), Herp (13Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), JNK (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser63, Cell Signaling); mouse monoclonal antibodies against Hsp70 (Sigma), PS1 (Chemicon), p-JNK (G7, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cytochrome c (PharMingen), and Bcl-2 (StressGen); chicken antibody against calreticulin (ABR); rat monoclonal antibody against caspase 12 (gift from J. Yuan, Harvard University); goat antibody against c-Jun (sc-45, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitation—Aliquots of cell lysates or brain homogenates containing 100 μg of total protein were incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc, anti-FLAG tag, or rabbit polyclonal anti-Herp antibodies in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein A or G for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times in immunoprecipitation buffer, and solubilized by heating in Laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min. In Vitro Protein Synthesis and Caspase Cleavage—Two oligonucleotides, 5′-GGGGTACCATGGAGTCCGAGACCGAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGTTTGCGATGGCTGGG-3′, were used to PCR amplify the entire open reading frame of Herp. The product, digested with KpnI and EcoRI, was ligated into the corresponding site of a plasmid vector, pZeoSV2(+) (Invitrogen), with a T7 priming site. Using the resultant plasmid DNA, pZeoSV2Herp, as a template, Herp was synthesized in vitro by the TnT T7 quick-coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega). [35S]Met-labeled full-length Herp protein was obtained by in vitro transcription and translation using the Promega Coupled kit (Promega) and subjected to cleavage by purified caspase-3 (gift from G. Salvesen, The Burnham Institute) as described (18Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Propp S.S. Ellerby H.M. Rabizadeh S. Cashman N.R. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Wellington C.L. Salvesen G.S. Hayden M.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Following experimental treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by a 30-min incubation in the presence of 5% nonimmune horse serum, and incubation in the presence of primary antibodies for 2 h or overnight. The primary antibodies included rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Herp (1:1000), Grp94, and Hsp60 (1:1000, StressGen), and mouse monoclonal antibodies against c-Myc (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and PS1 (1:500, Chemicon). Cells were then incubated for 1 h in PBS containing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled horse anti-mouse IgG or Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:50 dilution in PBS; Vector Laboratories). Cells were then washed with PBS, and images of fluorescence were acquired using the Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Analyses of Cell Death and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Cell viability was assessed using the fluorescent DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 or by the trypan blue exclusion method as described previously (18Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Propp S.S. Ellerby H.M. Rabizadeh S. Cashman N.R. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Wellington C.L. Salvesen G.S. Hayden M.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the fluorescent probe TMRE (Molecular Probes). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 100 nm TMRE, washed three times in fresh culture medium, and confocal images of cellular TMRE fluorescence were acquired using a confocal microscope (488 nm excitation and 510 nm emission). The average pixel intensity in individual cell bodies was determined using the software supplied by the manufacturer (Zeiss). Triplicate cultures were used for each condition, and all images were coded and analyzed without knowledge of experimental treatment history of the cultures. Cytochrome c Release—Cytochrome c release was analyzed by Western blotting. Proteins were extracted in lysis buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease mixture inhibitor set (Roche Applied Science). Homogenates were centrifuged twice at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to isolate the mitochondrial fraction. The resulting supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The remaining supernatant represents the cytosolic fraction. Both the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Caspase Activity Measurement—Caspase activity was assessed using a method described previously (11Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after exposure of cells to tunicamycin for designated time periods, cell membranes were permeabilized by incubation of cells in a solution of 0.01% digitonin in PBS for 5 min. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in PBS containing biotinylated DEVD-CHO (a substrate for caspase 3 as well as caspases 6, 7, 8, and 10) for 30 min. Cells were then fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, incubated for 5 min in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and then incubated for 30 min in PBS containing Oregon green-streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Images of fluorescence were captured using a confocal laser-scanning microscope, and the average pixel intensity in individual cell bodies was measured using software supplied by the manufacturer. Calcium Imaging—Levels of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were quantified by fluorescence imaging of the calcium indicator dye fura-2 as described previously (18Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Propp S.S. Ellerby H.M. Rabizadeh S. Cashman N.R. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Wellington C.L. Salvesen G.S. Hayden M.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 2 μm acetoxymethylester form of fura-2 (Molecular Probes) and then washed twice in Locke's buffer (mm: NaCl, 154; KCl, 5.6; CaCl2, 2.3; MgCl2, 1.0; NaHCO3, 3.6; glucose, 10; Hepes 5, pH 7.2) and allowed to incubate an additional 20–30 min to allow complete deesterification of the dye. Measurement of ER Ca2+ content was performed by washing and imaging the cells in Ca2+-free Locke's buffer upon addition of 1 μm thapsigargin. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (×40 oil immersion objective) coupled to an Attofluor imaging system. The average [Ca2+]i in 40–60 cells per microscope field was quantified in four separate cultures per treatment condition. Subcellular Fractionation—Pellets of frozen PC12 cells and cortical brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold fractionation buffer pH 7.4 (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclei were pelleted by a 10-min spin at 750 × g, and the supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in fractionation buffer, and the supernatant was recentrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The resulting supernatant contained the soluble cytosolic fraction, and the pellet constituted the microsomal fraction. The purity of the microsomal fraction was confirmed by the presence of grp94, an ER lumen protein. Herp Is Present in the ER in the Developing and Adult Brain and Its Levels Are Markedly Increased in Neurons Subjected to ER Stress—We first examined Herp protein levels in the mouse brain during development. Herp was present at relatively high levels in the cerebral cortex during embryonic development from ages E11 to E15, but levels decreased between E15 and postnatal day 2, and were decreased further in adult mice (Fig. 1A). A developmental decrease in constitutive expression of Herp similar to that seen in the cerebral cortex also occurred in the hippocampus and cerebellum (data not shown). The differential expression of Herp from E11 to postnatal day 2 suggests that Herp may play an important role during CNS development. In the adult rat and mouse, Herp protein levels were similar in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum (Fig. 1B). Next, we investigated the subcellular localization of Herp in adult brain cells. Brain homogenates were fractionated into nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Herp was predominantly found in the microsomal fraction along with grp94 suggesting that, as is the case in non-neuronal cells (13Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), Herp is also an ER-resident protein in neural cells. To determine whether Herp is induced by ER stress in neurons, we examined the time course of increase in Herp mRNA and protein levels in cultured primary rat cortical neurons after treatment with agents that induce ER stress. Basal levels of Herp mRNA and protein were very low in the cultured cortical neurons, but increased rapidly within 6 h of exposure to a subtoxic concentration tunicamycin (an agent that inhibits N-glycosylation) or thapsigargin (an inhibitor of the ER Ca2+-ATPase that induces depletion of ER Ca2+) (Fig. 1, D and E). Homocysteine (Fig. 1D) and 2-mercaptoethanol (data not shown), agents that modify the redox environment of the ER, also induced an elevation in Herp protein within 6 h. The up-regulation of Herp was specific for ER stress, because Herp levels did not increase in neurons subjected to serum deprivation, which induces apoptosis (data not shown). Overexpression of Herp Protects PC12 Cells against ER Stress-induced Cell Death—To determine the consequences of an increase in Herp protein levels during the ER stress response, we overexpressed Herp, or Herp-tagged with an N-terminal c-Myc tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag, in PC12 cells (Fig. 2A). Several clones stably overexpressing Herp were selected, and the level of Herp overexpression and its subcellular localization were analyzed by immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. The levels of Herp and tagged Herp (t-Herp) proteins in extracts of stably transfected PC12 were 4–8-fold higher than the endogenous level of Herp in VT cells (Fig. 2B). Confocal images of Herp immunoreactivity revealed localization to reticular structures in the cytoplasm, which were also stained with the anti-grp94 antibody demonstrating that Herp was mainly localized in the ER (Fig. 2C) as previously reported (13Kokame K. Agarwala K.L. Kato H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32846-32853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The tags did not affect protein localization, because the staining pattern of t-Herp was identical to that of the untagged protein. The levels of ectopic expression of Herp protein were approximately 2–6-fold higher than the total inducible Herp protein levels achieved in cells following exposure to 5 and 20 μg/ml tunicamycin, respectively, for 12 h (Fig. 2D), a time point at which greater than 80% of the cells exposed to 20 μg/ml tunicamycin were still viable (see also Fig. 3A). The effect of increased Herp levels on the vulnerability of cells to ER stress-induced death was determined by exposing Herp-overexpressing and VT cells to increasing concentrations of tunicamycin. Compared with VT cells, Herp-overexpressing cells were significantly more resistant to death induced by tunicamycin (Fig. 3A). After 24 h of exposure to a toxic concentration of tunicamycin (20 μg/ml), 77% of the VT cells were apoptotic compared with 42% of cells overexpressing Herp. Herp-overexpressing cells were also more resistant to ER stress-induced apoptosis following a prolonged exposure to a subtoxic concentration of tunicamycin (5 μg/ml). Similar results were obtained when thapsigargin (100 nm) was applied as the ER stressor (Fig. 3B). We also tested several other clones overexpressing Herp, and they were consistently more resistant to cell death induced by ER stress but were not more resistant to death induced by serum withdrawal (data not shown).Fig. 3Herp protects neural cells against ER stress-induced apoptosis.A and B, overexpression of Herp protects against ER stress-induced apoptosis. Cultures of vector-transfected (VT) and Herp-overexpressing PC12 cells were treated for various time points with (A) tunicamycin (Tun; 5 and 20 μg/ml) or (B) thapsigargin (100 nm), and the percentage of cells exhibiting condensed or fragmented nuclei in each culture was quantified.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (for sequences and target mRNAs for each siRNA targeting Herp (siRNAHerp) or nonsilencing control siRNA (siRNACTRL) see “Experimental Procedures”) were delivered in naive PC12 cells by nucleofection. One day after nucleofection, PC12 cells were exposed to 5 μg/ml Tun for the indicated time points and subsequently harvested for detection of endogenous levels of Herp, Grp78, and Grp94 by immunoblotting analysis (C) or fixed for quantitation of apoptotic cell death (D).

https://openalex.org/W2078269233,"Tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) is a disintegrin metalloproteinase that processes tumor necrosis factor and a host of other ectodomains. TACE is biosynthesized as a zymogen, and activation requires the removal of an inhibitory pro domain. Little is known about how the pro domain exerts inhibition for this class of enzymes. To study the inhibitory properties of the pro domain of TACE, we have expressed it in isolation from the rest of the protease. Here we show that the TACE pro domain (TACE Pro) is a stably folded protein that is able to inhibit this enzyme. TACE Pro inhibited the catalytic domain of TACE with an IC50 of 70 nm. In contrast, this inhibitory potency decreased over 30-fold against a TACE form containing the catalytic plus disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains (IC50 greater that 2 μm). The disintegrin/cysteine-rich region in isolation also decreases the interaction of TACE Pro with the catalytic domain. Surprisingly, we found that the cysteine switch motif located in TACE Pro was not essential for inhibition of the enzymatic activity of TACE; the pro domain variant C184A showed the same inhibitory potency against both TACE forms as wild type TACE Pro. X-ray absorption spectroscopy experiments indicate that binding of TACE Pro to the catalytic domain does include ligation of the catalytic zinc ion via the sulfur atom of its conserved Cys184 residue. Moreover, the binding of TACE Pro to the catalytic zinc ion partially oxidizes the catalytic zinc ion of the enzyme. Despite this, the nature of the interaction between the pro and catalytic domains of TACE is not consistent with a simple competitive model of inhibition based on cysteine switch ligation of the zinc ion within the active site of TACE.

TACE is a member of a family of proteases known as the ADAMs (adisintegrin and metalloproteinase). ADAMs are multidomain proteins typically comprising a pro domain, metalloproteinase domain, a disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain, transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail (4Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Google Scholar, 5Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Google Scholar). ADAMs are synthesized as latent precursors and later converted to the mature enzyme, lacking the pro domain, by furin or a furin-like enzyme in the secretory pathway (6Endres K. Anders A. Kojro E.

It has been shown previously that the pro domain of TACE seems to act as an inhibitor of this enzyme, because the activity of TACE was only recovered upon its removal (8Milla M.E.

TACE Pro includes a cysteine switch box (PKVCGY186), a feature present in most metzincins, including matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMs. It has been proposed that the pro domains of metzincins act as inhibitors of their catalytic domains through a mechanism that involves ligation of the cysteinyl thiol within the cysteine switch box to the zinc ion in the active site (9van Wart H. Birkedal-Hansen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5581Google Scholar, 10Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Google Scholar, 11Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1316-1322Google Scholar). The cysteine switch present in TACE Pro did appear to be important for inhibition of this enzyme, because thiol-modifying reagents such as 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and octylthioglucoside promoted pro domain release from the catalytic domain and, therefore, enzyme activation (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). TACE Pro also serves a second function: it is essential for the secretion of functional enzyme. In insect cells, a recombinant form of this enzyme lacking the pro domain failed to be secreted and was extensively degraded intracellularly (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). Similar results have been reported for other members of the ADAM family (12Anders A. Gilbert S. Garten W. Postina R. Fahrenholz F. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1837-1839Google Scholar, 13Loechel F. Overgaard M.T. Oxvig C. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13427-13433Google Scholar). At first approximation, this is similar to the secreted bacterial serine proteases subtilisin and α-lytic protease, in which the pro domain accelerates the folding of the catalytic domain by several orders of magnitude, apparently by lowering the conformational energy barrier between the unfolded and native states (14Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Google Scholar, 15Cunningham E.L. Jaswal S.S. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11008-11014Google Scholar, 16Strausberg S.

Here we show that the isolated pro domain of TACE is a potent inhibitor of the catalytic domain of this enzyme. TACE Pro is a less effective inhibitor of a form of TACE comprising the catalytic plus disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains, suggesting a role for the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain in pro domain removal and enzyme activation. We also show that the cysteine switch of TACE, although present in the zymogen form, is not required for the interaction between the pro and catalytic domains of TACE. Plasmid Constructs—A plasmid for expression of the pro domain of TACE in Escherichia coli, lacking the signal peptide, was constructed using the vector pRSET B (Invitrogen). A DNA fragment encoding residues Asp22 to Arg214 with an NdeI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using a previously reported pFastBac1 TACE plasmid as a template (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). The fragment was inserted at the BamHI and NdeI sites of pRSET B to obtain TACE Pro. TACE Pro C184A was made by cassette mutagenesis. The cassette was designed with EcoRV- and AccI-compatible ends for insertion into TACE Pro and carried a Cys to Ala mutation at position 184. Additional constructs for expression of double alanine mutants in the TACE Pro cysteine switch region (PKVCGYLKDVD190) were made by the same cassette mutagenesis approach. They carried a Cys to Ala mutation in position 184 and an additional alanine substitution at each individual position in the cysteine switch region. Expression of Recombinant TACE Pro Proteins—E. coli BL21(DE3) electrocompetent cells were transformed with the corresponding TACE Pro plasmid and plated on LB plates containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were resuspended in 1 liter of LB with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an optical density of 0.6 and harvested 3 h after induction. Purification and Refolding of Wild Type and Mutant TACE Pro—The cell pellets were washed once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and twice with the same buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Washed pellets were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 6 m Gdn-HCl and centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a 20-ml Ni+2-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 m Gdn-HCl and then with the same buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 m Gdn-HCl, 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against water. Under these conditions, the protein formed a white precipitate that was then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 6 m Gdn-HCl to a concentration of 6 mg/ml. 50 μl of this protein solution were incubated with 950 μl of refolding buffer (FoldIt Screen Formulation 16; Hampton Research) with addition of 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione, and 3 mm lauryl maltoside for 4 h at 4 °C with gentle stirring. After refolding, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. Finally, it was dialyzed against 250 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, with 150 mm NaCl (buffer A). The final protein concentration obtained after this procedure was 4–6 μm (0.09–0.14 mg/ml). Expression and Purification of TACE Truncates R473 and R651— The construction of TACE truncates R473 (Met1–Arg473) and R651 (Met1–Arg651) and production of baculovirus in Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) cells for protein production in insect cells have been described previously (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing Trichoplusia ni cells were infected with baculovirus strains encoding R473 or R651 at a multiplicity of infection of 1. The cultures were harvested 48 h after infection, and the proteins were purified as described previously (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). TACE Activity and Inhibition Assays—The inhibitory activity of TACE Pro was determined by an high performance liquid chromatography-based assay using the synthetic peptide dinitrophenyl-SPLAQAVRSSSR-NH2 as the substrate. TACE (R473 and R651), at a final concentration of 1 nm, was incubated with a series of TACE Pro concentrations ranging from 0 to 6 μm in buffer A. The incubation took place for 20 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate at a final concentration of 20 μm. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking, quenched by the addition of an equal volume of 1% heptafluorobutyric acid, and filtered using polyvinyl difluoride membrane filters. The quenched reaction mixtures were applied to a 150-mm C18 column (Vydac) and resolved using a gradient of 0.1% heptaflurobutyric acid in water and 0.1% heptaflurobutyric acid in acetonitrile. The ratio of product/substrate was obtained by integration of the absorbance of the resolved peaks at 350 nm. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded in an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter. Protein stocks were maintained at a concentration of 180 μm in buffer A containing 6 m Gdn-HCl. Those stocks were rapidly diluted 60-fold in buffer A to reach a final concentration of 3 μm of refolded protein. The spectra were taken between 208 and 260 nm using a 1-cm-path fused quartz cuvette. Scans were done in triplicate. For denaturation studies, the protein stocks were diluted into buffer A containing Gdn-HCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 7.5 m. The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded for four independent protein dilutions at each Gdn-HCl concentration. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The fluorescence emission scans were obtained using an AVIV ATF-105 spectrofluorometer. The samples were prepared in the same way as for CD spectroscopy. The protein samples were excited at 280 nm, and the intrinsic tryptophan emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm using a 3-mm-path cuvette. The photomultiplier tube was preset to 50% of the maximum output at a fixed excitation wavelength of 280 nm and an emission wavelength of 350 nm. For denaturation studies, the protein stocks were also diluted in buffer A containing a range of Gdn-HCl concentrations from 0 to 7.5 m. The emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm, and the center of mass of each spectrum (νc) was calculated using the equation, νc=Σ νiFi/Σ Fi where Fi is the fluorescence emitted at wave number νi. Sample Preparation for X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy Studies—The catalytic domain of TACE was concentrated by ultra filtration using Vivaspin 6-ml units (Vivascience AG; 10-kDa cut-off) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm (2.92 mg/ml). The samples were loaded into copper sample holders (10 × 5 × 0.5 mm) precovered with Mylar tape, which is transparent to X-rays, immediately followed by freezing in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then mounted inside a Diplex closed cycle helium cryostat, and their temperature was maintained at 30 K to minimize thermal disorder in the XAS data. XAS Data Collection—Data collection was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, beam line X9B. The spectra were recorded at the zinc K-edge (zinc absorption edge energy in which a 15-core electron is excited by the x-ray beam) in fluorescence geometry at a low temperature (30 K). The beam energy was defined using a flat Si (111) monochromator crystal. The incident beam intensity I0 was recorded using an ionization chamber. The fluorescence intensity was recorded using a 13-element germanium detector. The transmission signal from a zinc foil was measured with a reference ion chamber simultaneously with fluorescence to calibrate the beam energy position throughout all measurements. Five or six scans of each sample were collected. The samples were checked for burning marks after each scan, and the beam position on the sample was changed before each scan to minimize radiation damage. The enzyme integrity was checked before and after exposure to X-rays. In these experiments, TACE was found to be intact and fully active. XAS Data Processing and Analysis—The average zinc K-edge absorption coefficient μ(E), was obtained after averaging 5–13 independent XAS measurements for each sample. Each data set was aligned using the first inflection point of a reference zinc metal foil (9659 eV). Subsequently, the absorption coefficients for different samples were shifted in x-ray energy until their first inflection points were aligned at the same energy. The smooth atomic background was then removed with the AUTOBK program of the UWXAFS data analysis package, developed at the University of Washington at Seattle (18Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Physica B. 1995; 209: 117-120Google Scholar). For background removal, the energy shift, E0, was chosen as the edge shift of the processed data for each sample and used as the origin of the photoelectron energy. The R space region for minimizing the signal below the first shell was chosen between 0.6 and 1.2 Å. Upon background removal, the useful k range (energy range used in fitting procedure, in wave units) in the resultant k2-weighted (k) was between 0 and 10.0 Å-1. Model data for fitting procedures were constructed by extracting the structural zinc site coordinates (in a radius of 4 Å from the zinc) of gelatinase A (Protein Data Bank code 1CK7) and stromelysin-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1SLM). The theoretical photoelectron scattering amplitudes and phase shifts were calculated for each zinc ligand (path), using the computer code FEFF7 (19Rehr J.J. Mustre de leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5138Google Scholar, 20Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Ankudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 52: 2995-2999Google Scholar). The total theoretical signal (k) was constructed by adding the most important partial k values that contributed to the R range of interest. The theoretical XAFS signal was fitted to the experimental data using the nonlinear least squares method, implemented in the program FEFFIT 2.98 (18Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Physica B. 1995; 209: 117-120Google Scholar) in R space, by Fourier transforming of both theoretical and experimental data. The experimental data and theoretical values were weighted by k and multiplied by a Hanning window function in Fourier transforms. The Pro Domain of TACE Can Be Expressed in Isolation—It has been shown previously that the pro domain of TACE displays inhibitory activity against this enzyme (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar). To characterize the role of TACE Pro as an enzyme inhibitor, we attempted its expression in E. coli. TACE Pro was expressed at high levels and accumulated as inclusion bodies. The purification protocol involved a nickel chelate chromatography step under denaturing conditions followed by refolding via dialysis. Refolding of TACE Pro was the limiting step in obtaining large amounts of the protein, because of its tendency to aggregate at concentrations over 8 μm. Nevertheless, the final yield for this refolding step was typically 31–48%. After refolding, TACE Pro was over 95% pure judging by reducing SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein partitioned between two forms: a free monomer and a disulfide-linked dimer (Fig. 1). The free monomer constituted 40% of the purified protein, as determined by densitometric analysis of gels ran at different total protein concentrations. TACE Pro appeared to be folded according to both our fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy data. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission of TACE Pro after excitation at 280 nm showed a maximum at 325 nm, suggesting that its two tryptophan residues (Trp111 and Trp153) were in an environment of low polarity (Fig. 2A). For comparison, when the protein was subjected to chemical denaturation with 6 m Gdn-HCl, the fluorescence emission maximum shifted to the red, indicating the exposure of the tryptophans to bulk solvent in the unfolded polypeptide (Fig. 2A). The circular dichroism spectrum of TACE Pro showed a minimum between 208 and 230 nm, which revealed the presence of significant secondary structure in the protein (Fig. 2B). Upon chemical denaturation with Gdn-HCl, the CD ellipticity in this region was lost (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the pro domain of TACE is stably folded in isolation, we studied its unfolding under equilibrium conditions by monitoring the change in 1) the center of mass of the fluorescence emission and 2) the circular dichroism ellipticity at 222 nm versus denaturant concentration (Fig. 3). Both of these probes reported a single transition between the folded and unfolded states, characteristic of a cooperative, thermodynamically stable native state. The midpoint of this transition was observed at 1 m Gdn-HCl. TACE Pro Is an Inhibitor of TACE—We proceeded to test whether refolded TACE Pro could act as an inhibitor of TACE in vitro. We assayed the inhibitory activity of TACE Pro against two different TACE forms: 1) the catalytic domain of TACE alone and 2) the catalytic and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains of TACE. TACE Pro proved to be a very potent inhibitor of the catalytic domain (IC50 = 70 nm; Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this inhibitory potency dropped over 30-fold against the form containing the catalytic and disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains (IC50 higher than 2 μm; Fig. 4A). The inhibition curve for the mature ectodomain of TACE could not be completed because TACE Pro aggregated at concentrations around 8 μm. The disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain seems to affect the ability of the pro domain to stably bind the catalytic domain. To test whether the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain of TACE promotes dissociation of TACE Pro from the catalytic domain, we preincubated inactive pro-catalytic domain complexes with increasing amounts of disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain and then assayed for enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig. 5, even a short preincubation time (5 min) resulted in significant recovery of the catalytic activity of TACE (for example, at 10 μm of disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain, 38% of activity was observed relative to a control preparation of enzyme devoid of the pro domain; in contrast, only 3.5% of activity was observed with no addition of the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain). Larger increases in activity were observed after 2 h of preincubation (Fig. 5; 58% activity at 10 μm disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain, versus 3.4% in its absence). Therefore, this domain of TACE appears to decrease the affinity of the pro domain for the catalytic domain. The low levels of spontaneous activation in the absence of the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain are in agreement with previous observations showing that the catalytic domain activation of TACE was only promoted efficiently upon the addition of hydrophobic thiol-modifying reagents (8Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.-L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Google Scholar).Fig. 5TACE activation following incubation with the disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain. 100 nm samples of inactive TACE procatalytic domain complexes were preincubated for 5 min (○) or 4 h (•) with isolated TACE disintegrin/cysteine-rich domain in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. After incubation, the samples were diluted and assayed for activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” Activity is expressed as a percentage of control incubations lacking TACE Pro.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitory activity of TACE Pro could potentially be attributed to chelation of the zinc ion in the active site of the enzyme by the C-terminal His6 purification tag in TACE Pro. We addressed this possibility by using a TACE Pro variant that lacked that purification tail. This pro variant proved to have similar inhibitor profiles when tested against both forms of TACE (data not shown). An Intact Cysteine Switch Is Not Required for Inhibition— The pro domain of TACE contains a conserved cysteine residue at position 184 in the context of a cysteine switch consensus motif. This residue was expected to mediate inhibition via coordination to the zinc ion in the active site, as proposed in the cysteine switch model (9van Wart H. Birkedal-Hansen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5581Google Scholar, 10Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Google Scholar, 11Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1316-1322Google Scholar). To study the importance of the cysteine switch motif in the inhibition of TACE, we generated a variant of TACE Pro carrying a cysteine to alanine substitution at position 184 (TACE Pro C184A). The mutant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using the same protocol as for TACE Pro. TACE Pro C184A purified entirely as a monomer (data not shown) and had similar solution properties as its wild type counterpart. The fluorescence emission and CD spectra of TACE Pro C184A were basically indistinguishable from those of the wild type protein (Fig. 2). TACE Pro C184A also had similar equilibrium denaturation profiles to those of TACE Pro (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, the introduction of this cysteine to alanine mutation had only a modest effect in the inhibitory potency of TACE Pro. The IC50 values obtained for TACE Pro C184A were 40 nm against the catalytic domain and higher than 2 μm against the mature ectodomain (catalytic plus disintegrin/cysteine-rich domains). This suggests that the cysteine residue cannot determine by itself the interaction between the pro and catalytic domains of TACE. Other residues within the cysteine switch region (PKVCGYLKVD190) do not appear to be critical for the pro-catalytic domain interaction either, because alanine substitutions at each individual position of the switch region, in the context of TACE Pro C184A, affected the inhibitory ability of TACE Pro modestly, within 2-fold of the IC50 observed with wild type TACE Pro (Table I). Additional sequence elements within the pro domain different from the cysteine switch region, yet to be identified, must mediate the pro-catalytic domain interaction.Table IHalf-inhibitory concentrations (IC50) for a series of alanine mutants scanning the cysteine switch region of TACE in the presence of a C184A mutation Each protein was assayed against the catalytic domain of TACE as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data are the averages of two independent determinations (experimental errors within 15%) and are expressed as the nanomolar concentrations of the respective pro domain double mutant.TACE Pro mutantIC50nmP181A48.55K182A72.58V183A99.71G185A131.7Y186A70.98L187A57.32K188A87.98V189A69.24D190A81.87 Open table in a new tab Conformational Changes within the Active Site of the TACE Zymogen Probed by XAS—We wanted to address whether binding of TACE Pro to the catalytic domain of this enzyme changes the conformation and electronic state of the coordination shells surrounding the catalytic zinc ion. For this, we used x-ray absorption spectroscopy. XAS refers to modulations in x-ray absorption coefficient, μ(E), around an x-ray absorption edge of a given atom. Fig. 6A shows the XANES spectra of active and latent (bound to the pro domain) forms of TACE. The edge energy position of the pro-catalytic complex is shifted to higher energy by ∼0.45 eV in comparison with active TACE (catalytic domain alone). A shift in edge position is often an indication of structural modification at the metal site, such as different ligation (21Kleifeld O. Frenkel A. Martin J.M.L. Sagi I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 98-102Google Scholar). Specifically, this shift reflects a change in the total effective charge of the zinc ion in TA"

By contrast, most bacteria use trehalose solely as a general osmoprotectant or thermoprotectant. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis possess three pathways for the synthesis of trehalose. Most bacteria possess only one trehalose biosynthesis pathway and do not elaborate the disaccharide into more complex metabolites, suggesting a distinct role for trehalose in mycobacteria. We disabled key enzymes required for each of the three pathways in M. smegmatis by allelic replacement. The resulting trehalose biosynthesis mutant was unable to proliferate and enter stationary phase unless supplemented with trehalose. At elevated temperatures, however, the mutant was unable to proliferate even in the presence of trehalose. Genetic complementation experiments showed that each of the three pathways was able to recover the mutant in the absence of trehalose, even at elevated temperatures. From a panel of trehalose analogs, only those with the native α,α-(1,1) anomeric stereochemistry rescued the mutant, whereas alternate stereoisomers and general osmo- and thermoprotectants were inactive. These findings suggest a dual role for trehalose as both a thermoprotectant and a precursor of critical cell wall metabolites.

Trehalose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,1)-α-d-glucopyranoside, Fig. 1) is a non-reducing disaccharide that is abundant in mycobacteria in free form and in glycoconjugates that are found in the cytosol and the cell wall (1Elbein A.D. Pan Y.T. Pastuszak I. Carroll D. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 17R-27RCrossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Free trehalose is a major constituent of the cytosol. For example, in Mycobacterium smegmatis trehalose comprises ∼1.5–3% of the dry weight of the cell (2Elbein A.D. Mitchell M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 863-873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous studies in other organisms have suggested several purposes for the abundance of trehalose in mycobacteria. In Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, trehalose is known to be critical for thermotolerance (3Kandror O. DeLeon A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Free trehalose also acts as an osmoprotectant, and its synthesis is highly up-regulated in times of osmotic stress (6Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Recent work has demonstrated that the fast growing mycobacterium, M. smegmatis, contains a series of trehalose-based glucosyl and galactosyl oligosaccharides in the cytosol (7Ohta M. Pan Y.T. Laine R.A. Elbein A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3142-3149Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Many of these compounds may be biosynthetic precursors of closely related glycolipids found in the cell wall of this and other mycobacteria. Finally, there is a series of phosphorylated mannopyranosyltrehaloses of unknown function found in Mycobacterium bovis BCG (8Narumi K. Tsumita T. J. Biol.

Many of these metabolites are species-specific and have been used to facilitate the typing of mycobacterial strains (9Gautier N. Lopez Marin L.M. Laneelle M.A. Daffe M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 77: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The most widespread trehalose-containing glycolipids are trehalose 6-mycolate (trehalose monomycolate) and trehalose 6,6′-dimycolate (trehalose dimycolate, Fig. 1A). These compounds are loosely associated with the cell wall and may be removed by extraction or simple mechanical treatment (10Ortalo-Magne A. Lemassu A. Laneelle M.A. Bardou F. Silve G. Gounon P. Marchal G. Daffe M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Trehalose monomycolate has been implicated as a carrier of mycolic acid from the site of synthesis in the cytosol to the acceptor arabinogalactan in the cell wall and is ubiquitous among mycobacteria. Trehalose dimycolate has been detected in all mycobacteria with the exception of Mycobacterium leprae (11Dhariwal K.R. Yang Y.M. Fales H.M. Goren M.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 201-209PubMed Google Scholar). A metabolite known as “cord factor” is derived from trehalose dimycolate by modification of its lipid chains and has been associated with virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria (12Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Purified cord factor is a potent antigen and is the sole mycobacterial constituent capable of producing granulomas in animal models without protein antigen (13Hamasaki N. Isowa K. Kamada K. Terano Y.

Other trehalose-containing glycolipids include diacyl trehaloses substituted at the 2- and 3-positions, which have been isolated from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14Besra G.S. Bolton R.C. McNeil M.R.

In M. tuberculosis, a sulfated glycolipid known as sulfolipid-1 (Fig. 1D) has been identified as a putative virulence factor (20Goren M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 210: 116-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recent work is this laboratory has identified another sulfated trehalose metabolite, trehalose 2-sulfate, that may be a precursor of sulfolipid-1 and is presumably located in the cytosol (21Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Senaratne R.H. Leigh C.D. Williams S.J. Riley L.W. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 17037-17042Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Most prokaryotes possess only a single pathway for trehalose biosynthesis, through the action of the enzymes OtsA 1The abbreviations used are: OtsA, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase; OtsB, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase; TreY, maltooligosaccharyltrehalose synthase; TreZ, maltooligosaccharyltrehalose trehalohydrolase; TreS, trehalose synthase; Tre– mutant, trehalose biosynthesis mutant of M. smegmatis; DIG, digoxigenin; cfu, colony forming unit. and OtsB (22Arguelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). otsA encodes trehalose-6-phosphate synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose to form trehalose 6-phosphate. Trehalose 6-phosphate is subsequently dephosphorylated by the action of OtsB, trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, to afford free trehalose. OtsA and OtsB have been studied in detail in both bacteria and yeast (23Gibson R.P. Lloyd R.M. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Recently, a combined biochemical and bioinformatics study determined that some mycobacteria, including M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, possess three pathways for the synthesis of trehalose (26De Smet K.A. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Aside from the OtsA-OtsB trehalose synthase pathway outlined above, these mycobacteria possess two additional pathways (Fig. 2). In the TreY-TreZ pathway, first identified in Rhizobia (27Maruta K. Hattori K. Nakada T. Kubota M. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), Arthrobacter (28Maruta K. Hattori K. Nakada T. Kubota M. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1289: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (29Maruta K. Mitsuzumi H. Nakada T. Kubota M. Chaen H. Fukuda S. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1291: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), α-(1,4)-glucose polymers are converted to trehalose by isomerizing the terminal α-(1,4)-linkage to an α,α-(1,1)-linkage. This is accomplished by the product of the treY gene, maltooligosaccharyltrehalose synthase. The trehalose disaccharide is subsequently hydrolyzed from the polymer by the product of the treZ gene, maltooligosaccharyltrehalose trehalohydrolase. In the third trehalose synthesis pathway, also found in Pimelobacter (30Tsusaki K. Nishimoto T. Nakada T. Kubota M. Chaen H. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Thermus aquaticus (31Tsusaki K. Nishimoto T. Nakada T. Kubota M. Chaen H. Fukuda S. Sugimoto T. Kurimoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the product of the treS gene isomerizes the α-(1,4)-linkage of maltose directly to the α,α-(1,1)-linkage of trehalose. Interestingly, the slow growing mycobacterium M. leprae possesses only two routes for trehalose biosynthesis, the OtsA-OtsB and TreS pathways. M. leprae does possess regions homologous to TreY and TreZ, but these are interrupted with frame shifts and stop codons (26De Smet K.A. Weston A. Brown I.N. Young D.B. Robertson B.D. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Despite the widespread presence of trehalose in mycobacteria, little is known about the biological functions of this disaccharide and its conjugates. The presence of multiple biosynthetic pathways suggests a critical role for trehalose in mycobacteria. Indeed, Corynebacterium glutamicum, which also has multiple pathways, appears to be growth impaired when trehalose synthesis is completely disrupted (32Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Wolf A. Kramer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of trehalose and trehalose-containing metabolites, we constructed a mutant strain of M. smegmatis lacking all three pathways. We demonstrate that trehalose is vital both for growth and for entry into stationary phase and is not simply an osmo/thermoprotectant as in other bacteria. General—Pfu DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Amersham Biosciences. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Amersham Biosciences. Unnatural isomers of trehalose (α,β and β,β) were from Sigma. The xylosyl (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,1)-α-d-xylopyranoside (Glc-(1,1-α,α)-Xyl)) and galactosyl (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1,1)-α-d-galactopyranoside (Glc-(1,1-α,α)-Gal)) trehalose analogs were generated by chemical synthesis as reported previously (36Pratt M.R. Leigh C.D. Bertozzi C.R. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 3185-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid miniprep kits and the QIAquick kit for DNA extraction from agarose gels were from Qiagen. T4 DNA ligase was from New England Biolabs. Plasmids used in this work are shown in Table I, and oligonucleotide primers are shown in Table II. Preliminary sequence data for M. smegmatis were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research website at www.tigr.org. For E. coli, antibiotic concentrations used were the following: ampicillin, 100 mg liter–1; kanamycin, 50 mg liter–1; hygromycin, 200 mg liter–1; spectinomycin, 20 mg liter–1.

Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify 1.6–2-kb regions upstream and downstream of the desired gene. The three delivery vectors contained deletions of the central portions of each gene. In the case of OtsA and TreS, the central portions of the genes were replaced with a hygromycin resistance cassette and a spectinomycin resistance cassette (from pUC19Ω), respectively. In the case of TreY, an in-frame deletion of the middle portion of the treY gene was constructed to generate an unmarked mutant. The upstream regions of OtsA, TreS, and TreY were generated using the primer pairs: OtsA5′,5′f and OtsA3′,5′f; TreS5′,5′f and TreS3′,5′f; TreY5′,5′f and TreY3′,5′f (Table II), which generated PmlI/HindIII, HindIII/PstI, and HindIII/KpnI fragments, respectively. The downstream regions were generated using primer pairs OtsA5′,3′f and OtsA3′,3′f; TreS5′,3′f and TreS3′,3′f; and TreY5′,3′f and TreY3′,3′f (Table II), which generated BamHI/NotI, BamHI/BamHI, and KpnI/PacI fragments, respectively. The hygromycin resistance marker was inserted between the two OtsA fragments into the KpnI restriction site, and the spectinomycin resistance marker was inserted between the two TreS fragments into the BamHI restriction site. The final delivery vectors, p2NIL_MsOtsA, p2NIL_MsTreS, and p2NIL_MsTreY were generated by adding the PacI cassette (PAg85-lacZ Phsp60-sacB) from pGOAL17 to the vector bearing the mutated allele. The triple deletion mutant strain was prepared in three steps by sequentially transforming M. smegmatis mc2155 with the delivery vectors. In the first step the delivery vector p2NIL_MsOtsA was pretreated with UV light (120 mJ cm–2) and used to electroporate M. smegmatis mc2155. The deletion mutant was selected as described previously to afford mc2155::OtsA (34Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). In the second step this strain was transformed with UV light-treated p2NIL_TreS except with spectinomycin in place of hygromycin. After selection the genotype was confirmed as described below, to afford the double mutant containing deletions of OtsA and TreS (mc2155::OtsA/TreS). In the final step this strain was transformed with UV light-treated p2NIL_TreY, and transformants were selected for several rounds in the presence of 1 mm trehalose. The transformants were subjected to genotypic analysis to afford mc2155::OtsA/TreS/TreY. Genotypic Analysis—Genomic DNA was prepared from M. smegmatis by standard methods. Southern blotting analysis was carried using the DIG detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Hybridization probes were generated by PCR using the following pairs of primers: for mc2155::otsA, 5′ probe (OtsAForScreen and OtsA3,5f) and 3′ probe (OtsA3′flank3′end and OtsaRevScreen); for mc2155::otsA treS,5′ probe (TreSScreenFor and TreS3,5f) and 3′ probe (TreS3For and TreSScreen-Rev); and for mc2155::otsA treS treY, 5′ probe (TreY5ProbeFor and TreY5ProbeRev) and 3′ probe (TreY3ProbeFor and TreY3ProbeRev) (Table II) with Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science) using DIG-labeled dNTPs; one probe was specific for the upstream region of the gene (5′ probe), and one probe was specific for the downstream region (3′ probe). Genomic DNA was digested with the restriction enzymes as shown in the legend to Fig. 4, which generated unique bands for the wild type and mutant strains. The digested genomic DNA was separated by electrophoresis on two 0.8% agarose gels (20 V, 12 h), and each was transferred to a HyBond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by capillary action. After cross-linking the DNA to the membrane (UV light, 120 mJ), each blot was hybridized (68 °C) with DIG-labeled probes specific for regions upstream and downstream of the interrupted gene. After washing and blocking, the hybridized bands were detected using an anti-DIG-antibody-alkaline phosphatase fusion and 3-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate as substrate. Identification of M. smegmatis Homologs of OtsA, TreS, and TreY and Design of Trehalose Biosynthesis Mutant—To disrupt the trehalose biosynthesis pathways in M. smegmatis, we chose to target the enzymes OtsA, TreY, and TreS. For the OtsA-OtsB pathway, we elected to delete the gene for the glycosyl-transferase OtsA, as a mutant strain lacking OtsB might exhibit a leaky phenotype due to the action of endogenous nonspecific phosphatases. Similarly, in the TreY-TreZ pathway, we targeted the transglycosylase TreY rather than the hydrolase TreZ as there was potential for compensation of the TreZ deletion by other α-glucosidases in the cell. To confirm the presence of the three target genes in M. smegmatis, the sequences of OtsA, TreS, and TreY from M. tuberculosis were used as BLAST queries to search the unpublished M. smegmatis genome TIGR data base (www.tigr.org). Open reading frames corresponding to each gene were found in M. smegmatis. Additionally, homologs of the M. tuberculosis OtsB and TreZ genes were found, suggesting that these pathways for trehalose biosynthesis are intact in M. smegmatis. Construction and Analysis of OtsA, TreS, and TreY Deletion Mutants—To investigate the importance of trehalose biosynthesis in M. smegmatis, we constructed a series of single, double, and triple deletion strains of genes in each of the pathways. The chromosomal deletion mutants were constructed in sequential order starting with OtsA, followed by TreS and then TreY, using the general method of Parish and Stoker (34Parish T. Stoker N.G. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1969-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Southern analysis of genomic DNA was used to confirm the deletion of the genes. Fig. 3 shows the Southern blots for the OtsA single deletion strain, the OtsA/TreS double mutant, and the OtsA/TreS/TreY triple deletion mutant, hereafter denoted as the “Tre– mutant.” The Tre– Mutant Is a Trehalose Auxotroph and Requires Trehalose for Entry into Stationary Phase—The Tre– mutant was tested for growth in liquid media in the presence and absence of trehalose. The requirement for trehalose was initially difficult to ascertain due to the fact that the mutant must be grown in trehalose-containing media prior to phenotypic analysis and appears to store trehalose in some form. Thus, to test the requirement of the Tre– mutant for trehalose, the bacteria were first cultured in a minimal amount of trehalose required for growth (5 μm) for 1 day to starve them of the disaccharide before monitoring growth in the absence of trehalose. As shown in Fig. 4A, the Tre– mutant is indeed a trehalose auxotroph. The Tre– mutant also has a defect in its ability to enter stationary phase. Wild type and Tre– mutant strains were grown in the presence of 5 μm trehalose to starve them of trehalose and then used to inoculate fresh cultures in the presence or absence of trehalose. The strains were then plated at various dilutions over the next several days, and colony forming units (cfus) were quantified to assess the viability of the original culture. Wild type M. smegmatis showed an increase in cfu/ml through the exponential phase, which plateaus as the bacteria enter the stationary phase. Fig. 4B shows that while the wild type and supplemented Tre– mutant cells maintain their viability, the viability of the unsupplemented mutant drops off precipitously after 1 day. Three Pathways for Trehalose Biosynthesis Are Functionally Redundant for Growth of M. smegmatis in Culture—Complementation vectors were constructed in the plasmid pMS3GS using the M. tuberculosis otsA, treS, and treY genes. This kanamycin-resistant vector contains the promoter region for the M. tuberculosis glutamine synthetase and allows for the constitutive expression of proteins cloned downstream of the promoter region. A complete description of this vector can be found in (35Mougous J.D. Petzold C.J. Senaratne R.H. Lee D.H. Akey D.L. Lin F.L. Munchel S.E. Pratt M.R. Riley R.W. Leary J.A. Berger J.M. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Each complementation vector was independently transformed into the Tre– mutant, and transformants were grown on kanamycin-containing medium in the absence of trehalose. Each gene independently complemented the Tre– mutant to trehalose prototrophy (Fig. 5). In addition, all the single pathway mutants and all possible combinations of the double mutants were tested for growth. All strains showed trehalose-independent growth, and the growth rates of all of these strains was comparable with wild type bacteria (not shown). The level of free trehalose in each single pathway mutant was measured using a procedure similar to that reported by Elbein and Mitchell (2Elbein A.D. Mitchell M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 863-873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No significant differences were observed compared with wild type M. smegmatis (data not shown). We also labeled the single mutants and the Tre– mutant (grown in the presence of 20 μm trehalose as required) with [14C]glucose and characterized the gross metabolite profile by two-dimensional TLC. The major labeled species were similar in all of the strains (see Fig. S1 in supplemental material). The Tre– Mutant Displays a Temperature-sensitive Pheno-type Even When Supplemented with Trehalose—Some organisms up-regulate trehalose during thermal stress to prevent deleterious consequences such as protein aggregation. When trehalose biosynthesis is disrupted, organisms such as E. coli and S. cerevisiae show reduced viability under conditions of thermal stress (3Kandror O. DeLeon A. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9727-9732Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 460-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Interestingly, adding exogenous trehalose does not recover these mutants, suggesting that exogenous trehalose cannot be imported. To address the effects of trehalose biosynthesis disruption on thermal tolerance, we incubated the Tre– mutant at either 43 or 18 °C for 96 h and monitored growth by turbidity. Consistent with previous observations in other organisms, the Tre– mutant demonstrated severely reduced viability at these non-optimal temperatures, even when supplemented with concentrations of trehalose that promote its growth under optimal conditions (Fig. 6). Mutants expressing only one of the three trehalose biosynthesis pathways had similar viability to wild type cells. These results suggest that thermoprotection can only be achieved by endogenously biosynthesized trehalose, while recovery of the Tre– mutant under optimal conditions can be achieved by exogenously supplied trehalose. Rescue of the Tre– Mutant with Trehalose Analogs—To investigate the importance of trehalose's structure for rescue of the Tre– mutant, we assayed growth in the presence of trehalose analogs including the commercially available α,β- and β,β-trehalose isomers and synthetic analogs in which one glucose residue was replaced with either xylose or galactose (36Pratt M.R. Leigh C.D. Bertozzi C.R. Org. Lett. 2003; 5: 3185-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 8A, both α,β- and β,β-trehaloses could not rescue the mutant at concentrations as high as 500 μm, indicating that the α,α-(1,1) linkage is critical to the function of trehalose in M. smegmatis. The xylosyl (Glc-(1,1-α,α)-Xyl) and galactosyl (Glc-(1,1-α,α)-Gal) trehalose analogs were both able to recover the mutant at concentrations of 500 μm (Fig. 8B) but with slightly delayed growth kinetics (not shown). For the xylosyl analog, concentrations as low as 10 μm recovered the mutant as well as native trehalose, whereas the galactosyl analog was inactive at this concentration. Taken together, these data show that structural changes to native trehalose affect its ability to rescue the Tre– mutant.Fig. 8Growth of Tre– mutant with trehalose analogs. Overnight cultures of the Tre– mutant were grown in 5 μm trehalose. Cultures were pelleted and resuspended in fresh media twice before inoculating test cultures at a final A600 = 0.1. A, effect of α,β- and β,β-trehalose on mutant growth. B, effect of xylose- and galactose-containing trehalose analogs on mutant growth.

In the absence of trehalose, the Tre– mutant shows severely impaired growth. However, upon supplementation with trehalose, the mutant strain grows similar to wild type. Independent restoration of intact pathways for trehalose biosynthesis, namely the OtsA-OtsB, TreY-TreZ, or TreS pathways, by the use of complementation plasmids bearing the M. tuberculosis otsA, treS, or treY genes, converts the M. smegmatis Tre– mutant from trehalose auxotrophy to prototrophy. These data suggest that the three pathways for trehalose biosynthesis in M. smegmatis are mutually redundant for growth in the exponential phase. Of the three pathways in mycobacteria, the OtsA-OtsB pathway is the one shared by a majority of prokaryotes. Furthermore, the substrates used in this pathway, glucose 6-phosphate and UDP-glucose, are simpler and likely to be more abundant than the substrates of the other two pathways. These features invite speculation that the OtsA-OtsB pathway may be responsible for a majority of trehalose synthesis. However, the level of free trehalose we measured for the OtsA– mutant was comparable with wild type M. smegmatis. Two other groups have disrupted trehalose production in C. glutamicum. While Morbach and co-workers observed similar results (33Wolf A. Kramer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), Liebl and co-workers noticed a 2-fold decrease in intracellular trehalose levels in the absence of OtsA or TreY (32Tzvetkov M. Klopprogge C. Zelder O. Liebl W. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1659-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus it appears that mycobacteria can regulate trehalose levels in the absence of either OtsA or TreY. Both groups found that disruption of OtsA and TreY or TreZ in C. glutamicum, leaving the TreS pathway as the sole source of trehalose, produced a phenotype similar to the triple knock-out. In stark contrast, we observed that TreS alone, expressed from a complementation plasmid or from the endogenous gene, can support growth of M. smegmatis at wild type levels. This discrepancy may reflect differences in expression levels of TreS between corynebacteria and mycobacteria or abundance of the substrate, maltose. After entry into stationary phase, wild type M. smegmatis is viable for an extended period of time, with some cells surviving for periods up to two years (37Smeulders M.J. Keer J. Speight R.A. Williams H.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 270-283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the Tre– mutant rapidly loses viability after only 1 day in the absence of trehalose, showing a major impairment in stationary phase survival. This defect can be overcome by restoration of any one trehalose biosynthesis pathway. Mechanisms of stationary phase survival of mycobacteria have attracted considerable attention due to the importance of asymptomatic infection in tuberculosis. These data indicate that a supply of trehalose is essential for stationary phase survival in M. smegmatis and is likely to be significant for M. tuberculosis as well. At this stage the precise cause of trehalose auxotrophy in the Tre– mutant in unknown. Our data show that a functional trehalose biosynthesis pathway is required for thermoprotection, while exogenous trehalose does not suffice. In this case, trehalose is biosynthesized in the cytosol and can further be transported outside the bacterium for incorporation into cell wall metabolites. Additionally, M. smegmatis cannot use trehalose as a sole carbon source (data not shown) even though it possesses a cytosolic trehalase (based on genome analysis). Taken together, these results suggest that exogenous trehalose cannot gain entry into the cell. When grown under optimal conditions, the Tre– mutant does not require intracellular trehalose but still requires exogenous trehalose, presumably for critical secondary metabolites generated in the cell wall. As mentioned previously, mycobacteria produce a wide variety of trehalose conjugates and a subset of these are likely required for normal cell growth. Our studies with trehalose analogs support this notion. Derivatives with non-native glycosidic bond stereochemistry were unable to rescue the Tre– mutant despite their physical similarity to trehalose. Analogs in which a single functional group was perturbed were capable of restoring growth, although less efficiently than native trehalose. This is consistent with a scenario in which trehalose is enzymatically modified to more elaborated species that are required for cell proliferation. Trehalose-containing metabolites can differ from species to species; however, both trehalose and trehalose monomycolate are common to all species of mycobacteria that have been investigated. Similarly, trehalose dimycolate has been detected in all mycobacteria with the exception of M. leprae. Thus, it is likely that one or more of these common compounds are the agents that are required for the survival of M. smegmatis. Other groups have reported disruptions of one (38Jackson M. Raynaud C. Laneelle M.A. Guilhot C. Laurent-Winter C. Ensergueix D. Gicquel B. Daffe M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or two (39Armitige L.Y. Jagannath C. Wanger A.R. Norris S.J. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) of the three mycolyl transferases involved the formation of trehalose dimycolate, but there has been no report of a functional deletion of trehalose dimycolate until this work. Interestingly, the Tre– mutant could not be rescued by trehalose dimycolate itself (data not shown), ruling out this compound alone, although it may be required in combination with other trehalose-containing metabolites. An intriguing possibility is that trehalose is essential for cell wall biosynthesis in mycobacteria. It has been suggested that trehalose acts as a carrier for mycolic acid, transporting it from the point of synthesis in the cytosol to the cell wall where it is appended to the growing arabinogalactan chain (11Dhariwal K.R. Yang Y.M. Fales H.M. Goren M.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 201-209PubMed Google Scholar). If so, then the trehalose auxotrophy of the Tre– mutant could be explained by the inability of this strain to construct a functional cell wall. Notably, demonstration of the true carrier of mycolic acid for cell wall biosynthesis has remained elusive. It has also been suggested that polyprenol mannose 1-phosphates may act as carriers for mycolic acid based on the isolation of 6-mycolyl derivatives (40Besra G.S. Sievert T. Lee R.E. Slayden R.A. Brennan P.J. Takayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12735-12739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). If trehalose is acting as a mycolic acid carrier, this provides an explanation for the loss of viability in stationary phase. Recent work on M. smegmatis has shown that stationary phase cultures do not consist of dormant quiescent cells but rather a dynamic population of cells undergoing active growth and cell division (33Wolf A. Kramer R. Morbach S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1119-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this case, active transport of mycolic acid is expected to be essential for the construction of new cell walls. Interestingly, while most bacteria, plants, and insects synthesize trehalose, higher order vertebrates such as mammals do not. Mammals are capable of degrading trehalose through the action of trehalase, an enzyme present in the brush border of the small intestine and the kidney proximal tubule, which catabolizes trehalose into its glucose monomers (22Arguelles J.C. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that inhibitors of trehalose biosynthesis may therefore represent novel antitubercular targets (41Pan Y.T. Carroll J.D. Elbein A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 6091-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, our work suggests that the three pathways are redundant, at least in culture, rendering the trehalose biosynthesis system a complex target for drug development. It would be interesting to study the effects of disruptions in each of the pathways in a virulence model to clarify this point. Download .pdf (.32 MB) Help with pdf files"

The murine polyomavirus is a small, non-enveloped double-stranded DNA virus. It has a natural ability to infect a broad range of eukaryotic cells, which makes it a potentially useful vehicle for gene, protein, or drug delivery. The outer shell is composed of the major capsid protein VP1: 360 VP1 molecules are arranged in 72 pentamers on an icosahedral lattice (1Rayment I. Baker T.S. Caspar D.L.D. Murakami T. Nature. 1982; 295: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which encloses the inner core proteins VP2 and VP3. The latter proved not to be essential for capsid formation, as was shown by formation of virus-like particles after expression of VP1 alone in insect cells (2Montross L. Watkins S. Moreland R.B. Mamon H. Caspar D.L.D. Garcea R.L. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4991-4998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP1 recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (3Leavitt A.D. Roberts T.M. Garcea R.L. J. Biol.

Posttranslational modifications found in the wild-type virus, e.g. phosphorylation, are not required for capsoid formation.Other encapsulation strategies, like the liposome technology, have limited applicability for the delivery of low molecular weight substances such as methotrexate (MTX), 1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; CBD, chitin-binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCS, photon correlation spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP, reverse-phase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; mab, monoclonal antibodies; WW, domain of the formin-binding protein II.1The abbreviations used are: MTX, methotrexate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DMF, N,N-dimethylformamide; CBD, chitin-binding domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; PCS, photon correlation spectroscopy; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP, reverse-phase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SEC, size-exclusion chromatography; mab, monoclonal antibodies; WW, domain of the formin-binding protein II. because of leakage of enclosed but not covalently bound molecules (5Ng K.-Y.

Pharmacol. 2002; 54: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For gene delivery, viral and non-viral vectors are used almost exclusively as vehicles where DNA is either not specifically encapsulated or covalently bound to the surface of the vector (7Michael S.I. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 223-232PubMed Google Scholar). The major techniques for loading viral or non-viral vectors with DNA fragments or low molecular weight substances are assembly in the presence of high concentrations, (8Konigsberg P.J. Godtel R. Kissel T. Richer L.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1370: 243-251Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Krausewicz N. Cox C. Soeda E. Clark B. Rayner S. Griffin B.E.

Res. 2000; 17: 1062-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), or sonication (13Yang Y.W. Chen L.H. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 2000; 32: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).The major advantage of the enclosure of macromolecules, especially proteins, is the protection against enzymatic cleavage. Recently, an anchoring technique to achieve a directed localization to the inward-oriented side of the capsoid-forming subunits prior to assembly has been described. Schmidt et al. (14Schmidt U. Rudolph R. Bohm G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1658-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) employed WW domains, fused to the inward-oriented side of VP1, as small modules interacting specifically with prolinerich regions of the molecules to be encapsulated.In this study, we established a new method to efficiently encapsulate proteins and low molecular weight substances by exploiting the ability of VP2 to bind tightly into the inward-facing VP1 pentamer cavity (15Griffith J.P. Griffith D.L. Rayment I. Murakami T. Caspar D.L.D. Nature. 1992; 355: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We used a conserved stretch of 47 amino acids of VP2 for the attachment of model substances like green fluorescent protein (GFP) and MTX, allowing efficient encapsulation of both substances in VP1 capsoids. Because of the open issue of the hydrophobic interplay between VP1 and VP2 molecules, we analyzed two VP2 derivates for their capacity to encapsulate attached ligands (GFP or MTX). It should be noted that both VP2 derivates have the same affinity for binding to VP1-pentamers.Because of the fixed ratio of one VP2 binding site per VP1 pentamer, the amount of encapsulated molecules was well reproducible, and their concentrations could thus be standardized, which was essential for defined delivery of MTX in cell culture experiments. GFP fluorescence allows easy monitoring of the encapsulation efficiency during capsoid production, as well as of the cellular uptake. MTX is a well known antifolate used in tumor therapy, which is usually taken up into cells by the reduced folate carrier and converted to the intracellularly persistent MTX polyglutamates. MTX and MTX polyglutamates inhibit the folate-dependent enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase, thus abrogating DNA synthesis and cell division and resulting in cell death (16Calvert H. Sem. Oncol. 1999; 26: 3-10PubMed Google Scholar). A major mechanism of resistance to MTX (17Bertino J.R. Göker E. Gorlick R. Li W.W. Banerjee D. Stem Cells. 1996; 14: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) is a transport deficiency of the reduced folate carrier. We wanted to find out whether MTX, when endocytosed inside a macromolecular carrier-like capsoid and delivered to a different cell compartment, exhibits toxicity in the same way as the unconjugated drug and is able to overcome MTX transport resistance of cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was obtained from peqlab (Erlangen, Germany), and kanamycin sulfate was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Amino acid derivatives were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem AG, methotrexate, 2-mercaptosulfonic acid, ethanethiol, O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborat (TBTU), 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimid (EDCI), piperidin, diisopropylethylamin (DIPEA), Me2SO, and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) from Sigma-Aldrich. DNase, water, and acetonitrile were obtained from Merck. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England Biolabs or from MBI Fermentas, and oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by ThermoHybaid.Cloning and Vector Construction—The complete mouse polyoma virus VP1 cDNA, obtained as an EcoRI-SdaI fragment from expression vector pHB17/6 (11Braun H. Boller K. Löwer J. Bertling W.M. Zimmer A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 29: 31-43PubMed Google Scholar), was subcloned into the corresponding restriction sites of Litmus28 (New England Biolabs). After the addition of an NdeI site comprising the start codon of VP1 and removal of a second endogenous NdeI site by site-directed mutagenesis with a modified QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene), the VP1 cDNA was subcloned as an NdeI-BamHI fragment into the expression vector pSG1 (a pBR322 derivative containing an IPTG-inducible tac promoter), resulting in the final vector pSG1/VP1 used for expression of VP1. For construction of the expression vector pTXB1/GFP-VP2A1, the GFP-cDNA was amplified by PCR from pEGFP-N1 (BD Clontech) with primers generating a 5′-NdeI site comprising the start codon and 3′-SapI and EcoRI sites, and cloned into NdeI and EcoRI sites of pTXB1 (New England Biolabs). The resulting construct, termed pTXB1/C-GFP, was used for the fusion of the sequence coding for VP2(B) between the C terminus of GFP and the N terminus of the Mxe intein-chitin-binding domain (CBD) affinity tag by PCR-amplification of VP2(B) from vector pHB1 (11Braun H. Boller K. Löwer J. Bertling W.M. Zimmer A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1999; 29: 31-43PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for PCR amplification of VP2(B) generated inversely arranged terminal SapI sites, allowing directional cloning of the product into the corresponding restriction sites of the vector. The VP2(A) variant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of VP2(B) as described above. The expression vector pTXB1/VP2A8 was obtained by PCR-amplification of the sequence coding for VP2(A), with primers generating 5′-NdeI and 3′-SapI sites, and subsequent cloning into the corresponding restriction sites of vector pTXB1.Preparation of GFP-VP2(A)—GFP-VP2(A) was expressed as an N-terminal fusion with the Mxe intein/CBD from expression vector pTXB1/GFP-VP2A1 in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The expression of GFP-VP2(A) was induced at an A600 of 0.6–1.0 by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mm, and cultivation was continued for 5 h. After harvest, the cells were resuspended in 200 ml of buffer MxeL (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) including 10 μl of benzonase (25 units/μl; Merck) and broken by five passages through a Gaulin LAB 1000 homogenizer at 800 bar. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 70,000 × g and 4 °C for 1 h; the clear supernatant was supplied with 10 ml of chitin beads equilibrated in MxeL and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. After a 10-min centrifugation at 3000 × g, the slurry was transferred to a chromatography column and washed overnight with buffer MxeW1 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m guanidinium-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C and a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. After washing the column with 50 ml MxeW2 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), the gel bed was flushed with MxeC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm DTT) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to ensure complete cleavage of the Mxe intein-CBD moiety. The free GFP-VP2(A) fusion protein was eluted with MxeC buffer, the peak fractions were pooled and concentrated with Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Finally, the protein solution was incubated for another 3 h at 25 °C to allow the complete formation of the GFP chromophore. Homogeneity of the protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, and the concentration was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy.Purification of Recombinant Polyoma VP1—E. coli BL21 cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 70 μg/ml kanamycin. Expression of VP1 was induced by the addition of 1 mm IPTG. After continued cultivation for 5 h, the cells were harvested, resuspended in P-A buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 6 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, pH 8.5) and lysed at 800 bar using a Gaulin LAB 1000 homogenizer. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 2 h and 4 °C, and VP1 was captured from the supernatant by an anion-exchange column (Poros, Applied Biosystems) previously equilibrated with P-A buffer. After elution of VP1 from the column by a linear gradient of NaCl from 5 mm to 1 m, the protein was dialyzed against QS-A buffer (20 mm ethanol amine, 2 mm EDTA, 6 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, pH 10.5) overnight. The VP1-solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted again by a linear gradient of NaCl to 1 m. Afterward, the protein was dialyzed against L1 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 6 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.0). The final step of the VP1 purification was a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) by which aggregates of VP1 were removed. Homogeneity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE, photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy.Expression and Purification of VP2-SEt—VP2-SEt was expressed as an N-terminal fusion with the Mxe intein/CBD from expression vector pTXB1/VP2A8 in E. coli BL21(DE3) as described for GFP-VP2(A). Cells were harvested and the pellets were stored at -80 °C. After thawing the cell pellets (which were obtained from 12 liters of culture volume) on ice, cells were resuspended in 125 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml DNase, pH 6.8) and broken by five passages through a Gaulin LAB 1000 homogenizer at 800 bar. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 45 min, the clarified supernatant was loaded onto a chitin column, washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) and cleaved with buffer C (2% (v/v) ethanethiol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.8) overnight at room temperature. After elution according to the instruction manual, the protein was isolated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent SB C18 column; for solvent system, see above). In an HPLC-MS reanalysis of the product fraction, VP2-SEt was found to be >98% pure.Synthesis of Dipeptide Linker—MTX-Boc-Cys(Trt)-Lys(Fmoc)-OMe was synthesized according to a standard TBTU-peptide coupling protocol. The product could be isolated quite pure from the reaction mixture by precipitation with water, filtration, and lyophilization. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) calculated m/z for C49H53N3O7S [M+Na]+ = 851.0; the found m/z = 850.5. Deprotection of the lysine side chain was accomplished by treatment of 50 mg Boc-Cys(Trt)-Lys(Fmoc)-OMe with 100 μl of 20% piperidin in DMF at room temperature for 20 min. The product was purified by solid phase extraction on an RP-C18-cartridge with H2O/acetonitrile and then lyophilized. After removal of the solvents, the raw product Boc-Cys(Trt)-Lys-OMe was obtained in quantitative yield as a colorless amorphous powder. ESI-MS calculated m/z for C34H43N3O5S [M+H]+ = 606.8; the found m/z = 806.2. A 1.5 molar excess of MTX (23.3 mg) was pre-activated with 8.5 mg of EDCI-HCl and 15.3 μl of DIPEA in 400 μl of DMF for 5 min and then added to a solution of 18.0 mg Boc-Cys(Trt)-Lys-OMe in 400 μl of DMF. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 ml of H2O. The product was centrifuged (20,000 × g for 1 min), purified by preparative reverse-phase (RP)-HPLC and lyophilized to give Boc-Cys(Trt)-Lys(MTX)-OMe as a yellow amorphous powder. The yield was 28.4 mg (95%); ESI-MS calculated m/z for C54H63N11O9S [M+H]+ = 1043.2; found m/z = 1043.3. Both protecting groups of the cysteine were removed by treatment with TFA:EtSH:H2O: TIPS (50:10:4:2) for 5 h at room temperature. The deprotected MTX-dipeptide conjugate was precipitated with ice-cold diethylether. After centrifugation, the raw linker-MTX conjugate was isolated as an orange amorphous solid. ESI-MS calculated m/z for C30H41N11O7S [M+H]+ = 700.8; found m/z = 700.3 Da.Synthesis of VP2-Cys-Lys(MTX)-OMe—15.3 mg of VP2-SEt and a 3-fold molar excess (6.9 mg) of Cys-Lys(MTX)-OMe were dissolved in 2.7 ml of 400 mm phosphate buffer, containing 10 mm EDTA and 10% (v/v) Me2SO. One equivalent of tris-carboxyethyl phosphine was added to establish reductive conditions, and 2-mercaptosulfonic acid (0.1 equivalents) was added as a catalyst. The reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC and showed a quantitative derivatization of VP2-SEt after 18 h. After final reduction by the addition of 2 equivalents of DTT at room temperature for 15 min, the solvents were removed in vacuum, and the raw product was isolated by preparative HPLC (Agilent SB C18 column; for solvent system, see above). The HPLC-MS analysis showed a purity of >98% for the obtained VP2-Cys-Lys(MTX)-conjugate.Formation of Capsoids from VP1 Pentamers and VP2 Anchor Constructs Containing GFP or MTX—For the assembly of capsoids, DTT was removed from the VP1 pentamer solution with a desalting column (HiPrep 26/10, Amersham Biosciences; column volume = 53 ml, flow rate = 2 ml/min) equilibrated with KB1 buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, pH 6.8). Structural integrity and concentration of the desalted pentamers were determined by PCS and UV-visible spectroscopy. VP1 pentamers were incubated with a 7-fold molar excess of GFP-VP2(A) or with a 6-fold molar excess of VP2(B)-MTX for 1 h at room temperature, respectively. Afterward, assembly of the pentamers was initiated by adding KB2 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3 m (NH4)2SO4, pH 8.0) to a final ammonium sulfate concentration of 250 mm. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the formed capsoids were oxidized by the addition of KB3 (400 mm GSSG in KB2) to a final GSSG concentration of 7.2 mm. Afterward, the protein was dialyzed overnight at 25 °C against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Biochrom KG) containing 0.7 mm CaCl2. The excess of non-assembled VP2-anchor construct was removed by SEC using a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences; flow rate = 0.5 ml). A precipitation with polyethylene glycol (10% PEG 3000, Sigma-Aldrich) was performed to concentrate the capsoids for cell-culture experiments.PCS—Particle sizing was performed at 25 °C using a high performance particle sizer (ALV-NIBS). The particle size was calculated by the autocorrelation function of the ALV sizer software.Immunoprecipitation—3.1 μm VP1 pentamers were co-incubated for 4 h at 25 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of GFP-VP2(A) or GFP, respectively. VP1 pentamers, GFP, and GFP-VP2(A) were also incubated and served as controls. Protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with KB1 buffer and monoclonal antibodies (mab) directed against a conformational determinant of VP1-specific pentamers and appropriate capsoids (mab17 was kindly provided by Dr. M. Pawlita, Heidelberg, Germany) or GFP were coupled for 1 h at 25 °C. After washing the Sepharose two times with IP wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), the above described protein samples were added and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Unbound protein was removed by washing three times with IP wash buffer. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by reducing SDS-10% PAGE and Western-blotting.Fluorescence Spectroscopy—To investigate the interaction between VP1 pentamers and the GFP-VP2(A) anchor construct, GFP fluorescence polarization measurements were carried out. GFP-VP2(A) was incubated with an increasing amount of VP1-pentamers for 2 h at 25 °C. GFP fluorescence polarization was measured at 510 nm (excitation = 488 nm) for 10 min in a thermostatically controlled cell using a Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorimeter with autopolarizer (Jobin Yvon, Bensheim, Germany). The average signal was plotted against the VP1 pentamer concentration [M] and the dissociation constant (Kd) calculated according to Equations 1, 2, 3, c=V0+A0+Kd (Eq. 1) VA=c2−(c2)2−V0⋅A0 (Eq. 2) f=S0+(Smax−S0)⋅VAA0 (Eq. 3) V0 is the initial concentration of the VP1 pentamer, A0 is the concentration of the VP2 anchor, and VA is the concentration of the complex. S stands for the starting (S0) and the maximum signal (Smax). In addition, the assembly of capsoids was monitored by measurement of light scatter of the sample at an angle of 90° and a wavelength of 360 nm. Analytical SEC was carried out to follow capsoid formation by using a Superdex 200 h 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences; volume = 23.5 ml; flow rate = 0.5 ml).High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-ESI-MS—HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies 1100 MSD Series system equipped with diode array detector and coupled single-quadrupole MS. HPLC solvents consisted of 1% acetonitrile in H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 90% acetonitrile in H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B). A Polymerlabs PLRP-S (300 Å, 4.6 × 150 mm) column was used at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. The gradient started with a solvent composition of 80% solvent A and 20% solvent B, followed by a linear gradient in 20 min to 0% solvent A and 100% solvent B, after which the column was re-equilibrated.Cell Cultivation—Swiss mouse fibroblasts (Swiss 3T3) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Pan Biotech) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). The human T cell leukemia line CCRF-CEM was cultivated in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 2.5% human serum, 4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES buffer (all obtained from Pan Biotech), and 200 μg/ml human serum albumin (Pharma Dessau GmbH). The MTX transport-resistant CCRF-CEM/MTX cells (18Wright J.E. Rosowsky A. Waxman D.J. Trites D. Cucchi C.A. Flatow J. Frei III, E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2209-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were cultivated in the same medium with additional 1 μm MTX. For experiments, the cells were grown in medium without MTX for seven passages. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination and grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-air humidified incubator.Fluorescence Immunocytochemistry with Swiss 3T3 Cells—Swiss 3T3 cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days. For the attachment of GFP-loaded capsoids or VP2-GFP(A) anchor to the cell surface, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μg/ml GFP-loaded capsoids (∼4 × 106 particles per cell) or 10 μg/ml VP2-GFP(A) anchor, respectively. After 1 h of incubation at 0 °C, some samples were immediately prepared for immunocytochemistry (attachment, 0 h) by washing the cells in ice-cold medium for the removal of unbound GFP-loaded capsoids or VP2-GFP(A) anchor. For the uptake of GFP-loaded capsoids or VP2-GFP(A) anchor after attachment, some samples were washed in pre-warmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, transferred to 37 °C, and incubated for 0.5, 1, and 3 h, respectively. After the indicated time points, all samples were prepared for visualization of VP1 by immunofluorescence. The following steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and incubated with 80 mm glycine (Sigma) in PBS (pH 8) for 10 min to block free aldehyde functions. After washing twice with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 4 min for intracellular staining of VP1, or they remained unpermeabilized for VP1 staining on the cell surface by incubating with PBS only. All samples were rinsed twice with PBS. Blocking of unspecific binding was performed with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (albumin fraction V, Roth, Germany) for 15 min, followed by incubation with a mouse anti-VP1 mab13 (undiluted hybridoma supernatant) for 1 h, washing twice with PBS, and labeling with a Cy3-rabbit-anti-mouse polyclonal antibody (Dianova) diluted 1:300 in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. The anti-VP1 mab13 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Pawlita) recognizes a conformational determinant of VP1 pentamers as well as VP1 capsoids. As shown by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western-blotting analysis (data not shown), denatured VP1 protein could not be detected with anti-VP1 mab13. It should be noted that anti-VP1 mab13 and mab17 could recognize similar epitopes of particulate VP1-structures. 2M. Pawlita, personal communication. Samples were rinsed twice with PBS, and cell nuclei were stained for 5 min with 0.2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS. After washing with PBS and H2O, coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with anti-fading solution (6 g of glycerol, 2.4 g of Mowiol™; Calbiochem) and 0.2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]octane in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Two control conditions were examined: incubation of cells with VP2-GFP(A) anchor and immunofluorescence staining with omission of primary antibody as negative control. None of these conditions resulted in cell staining. GFP fluorescence and the immunofluorescence signal of VP1/Cy3 were observed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) and fluorescence filters F11–013 (DAPI), F41–054 (GFP) and F41–007 (Cy3) (AHF Analysentechnik). Pictures were taken with a digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments model 2.3.0), followed by digital image processing with Metamorph software, version 4.6 (Visitron Systems).Dose-response Assays with CCRF-CEM and CCRF-CEM/MTX Cells—Exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 1.5 × 104 cells in 200 μl of RPMI per well containing different concentrations of MTX-loaded capsoids, MTX (USP grade; Sigma), capsoids (control), VP2(B)-MTX anchor (control), or medium only (untreated control). After 24, 48, and 72 h, a Calcein™ viability assay was performed. 100 μl of medium per well were aspirated, and 100 μl of a 20 μm solution of Calcein™ (Molecular Probes Europe) in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (Biochrom KG) were added to a final Calcein™ concentration of 10 μm. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence was measured at 485 nm/528 nm (excitation/emission) with an FLx800T BIE-microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments GmbH, Bad Friedrichshall, Germany). CCRF-CEM/MTX cells were grown in medium without MTX for seven passages and seeded in 96-well plates with 1.5 × 104 cells in 200 μl of RPMI medium 1640 per well containing different concentrations of MTX-loaded capsoids, MTX, capsoids (control), VP2(B)-MTX anchor (control), or medium only (untreated control). After 48 h of incubation, a Calcein™ viability assay was performed as described above.Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of Capsoids—Capsoids, GFP-loaded capsoids, or MTX-loaded capsoids were attached to formvar carbon-coated grids (300 mesh; Plano GmbH) and contrasted by the single-droplet negative-staining technique modified after Harris (19Harris J.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 117: 13-30PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, grids were wetted for 10 s on a 20-μl droplet of an aqueous solution of 0.1% poly-L-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma), washed on a droplet of 20-μl H2O, and transferred to a droplet of 20-μl PBS containing 100 μg/ml capsoids, GFP-loaded capsoids, or MTX-loaded capsoids. After 2 min of attachment, grids were washed twice with 20 μl of H2O and negative stained for 15 s in 20 μl of an aqueous solution of 5% uranyl acetate (Plano GmbH). After drying for 5 min, samples were ready for immediate TEM study on a Zeiss LEO 906E (LEO Elektronenmikroskopie GmbH) operating at 80 kV.RESULTSExpression and Purification of VP1—The outer shell protein VP1 of murine polyomavirus was expressed in E. coli. The protein self-assembled into soluble pentamers in the cytoplasm of E. coli and was purified by ion exchange and SEC to homogeneity (data not shown). Neighboring VP1 pentamers are covalently linked by disulfide bonds and calcium bridges in the capsoid (20Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 21Stehle T. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), preventing disassembly of the structure in the absence of reducing and chelating agents. To avoid aggregation of VP1 pentamers by unspecific cross-linking, DTT and EDTA were present in all buffers throughout the purification process. Under these conditions, the protein was stable and could be stored at -80 °C for several months.VP2 Anchor Variants—Because of the hydrophobic character of the anchor molecule, we chose different VP2 variants for the expression of the GFP-VP2(A) fusion protein and covalent linkage of MTX to the VP2(B) anchor, to obtain soluble proteins capable of interacting with VP1 pentamers. Variant VP2(A) is based on the VP2 sequence found in the mouse polyoma virus Py-2a strain (22Chen S.X. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 12: 3233-3240Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Variant VP2(B) was derived from polyoma virus strain 3. Both anchor"
https://openalex.org/W2078783287,"Trypanothione reductase is a key enzyme in the trypanothione-based redox metabolism of pathogenic trypanosomes. Because this system is absent in humans, being replaced with glutathione and glutathione reductase, it offers a target for selective inhibition. The rational design of potent inhibitors requires accurate structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes, but this is lacking for trypanothione reductase. We therefore used quinacrine mustard, an alkylating derivative of the competitive inhibitor quinacrine, to probe the active site of this dimeric flavoprotein. Quinacrine mustard irreversibly inactivates Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase, but not human glutathione reductase, in a time-dependent manner with a stoichiometry of two inhibitors bound per monomer. The rate of inactivation is dependent upon the oxidation state of trypanothione reductase, with the NADPH-reduced form being inactivated significantly faster than the oxidized form. Inactivation is slowed by clomipramine and a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (both are competitive inhibitors) but accelerated by quinacrine. The structure of the trypanothione reductase-quinacrine mustard adduct was determined to 2.7 Å, revealing two molecules of inhibitor bound in the trypanothione-binding site. The acridine moieties interact with each other through π-stacking effects, and one acridine interacts in a similar fashion with a tryptophan residue. These interactions provide a molecular explanation for the differing effects of clomipramine and quinacrine on inactivation by quinacrine mustard. Synergism with quinacrine occurs as a result of these planar acridines being able to stack together in the active site cleft, thereby gaining an increased number of binding interactions, whereas antagonism occurs with nonplanar molecules, such as clomipramine, where stacking is not possible.

Parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida are the causative agents of several serious tropical diseases. These comprise Chagas' disease (caused by Trypanosoma cruzi), sleeping sickness (by Trypanosoma brucei spp.), and the leishmaniases, caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania (1Manson-Bahr P.E.C. Bell D.R. Manson's Tropical Diseases. 19th Ed. Baillière Tindall, London, UK1987: 54-113Google Scholar). Despite these infections causing in excess of 120,000 deaths per annum (2Organization World Health The World Health Report 2002: Reducing Risks, Promoting Healthy Life. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2002: 169-232Google Scholar), comparatively little research effort is directed toward these diseases. As a result of this disregard, current chemotherapy is poor and treatment failure is common, because of widespread drug resistance and severe side effects. The development of new drugs to treat these diseases would be aided by the discovery of compounds that interfere with processes that are essential to the parasites but absent from their human hosts. A promising target for the design of such inhibitors is the thiol metabolism of these protozoa. This is dependent upon trypanothione (T[SH]2 or N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine), 1The abbreviations used are: T[SH]2, dihydrotrypanothione (N1,N8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine); QM, quinacrine mustard; TryR, trypanothione reductase; T[S]2, trypanothione disulfide; Mel T, adduct of melarsen oxide with dihydrotrypanothione. a low molecular mass dithiol that is absent from humans but used by the kinetoplastids to maintain their intracellular redox balance (3Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Ulrich P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This thiol acts to counteract environmental stress through a variety of enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions and has been implicated in acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (4Schmidt A. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 1239-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Parasitol. Today. 1993; 9: 150-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Many of these protective reactions oxidize T[SH]2 to trypanothione disulfide (T[S]2), which is then recycled back to T[SH]2 by trypanothione reductase (TryR), an NADPH-dependent disulfide oxidoreductase. TryR is thought to be the key enzyme in the redox metabolism of these organisms, acting as the sole route of reducing equivalents from the NADP+/NADPH couple to thiol-containing species (6Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The fundamental importance of TryR activity to parasite survival has been demonstrated by both genetic manipulations and the discovery that the targets of several of the current antiprotozoal drugs are enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism (7Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Smith A.C.

Burger's Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery: Chemotherapeutic Agents. John Wiley & Sons, New York2003: 1033-1087Google Scholar). In contrast, in the mammalian host, the major low molecular mass thiol is glutathione, with the enzyme glutathione reductase acting to reduce glutathione disulfide (10Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). Although TryR and glutathione reductase are closely related and show ∼40% sequence identity (11Aboagye-Kwarteng T. Smith K. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3089-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), each enzyme is highly specific for its respective substrate (12Henderson G.B. Fairlamb A.H. Ulrich P. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 3023-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of a T. cruzi TryR-T[S]2 complex has been solved, demonstrating that this specific recognition of T[S]2 is mainly determined by the negative charge and hydrophobic surfaces within the large TryR active site (13Bond C.S. Zhang Y.H. Berriman M. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. Structure (Camb.). 1999; 7: 81-89Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The marked differences between the TryR and glutathione reductase active sites therefore make selective inhibition possible, and a large number of TryR-specific inhibitors have already been identified (14Augustyns K. Amssoms K. Yamani A. Rajan P.K. Haemers A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1117-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Many of these TryR inhibitors are tricyclic compounds that are thought to interact with the hydrophobic polyamine-binding site within the active site (15Garforth J. Yin H. McKie J.H. Douglas K.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1997; 12: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized of these inhibitors is quinacrine, an acridine derivative that is an effective and selective inhibitor of TryR (16Krauth-Siegel R.L. Lohrer H. Bucheler U.S. Schirmer R.H. Coombs G.H. North M.J. Biochemical Protozoology. Taylor and Francis, London1991: 493-505Google Scholar, 17Chibale K. Haupt H. Kendrick H. Yardley V. Saravanamuthu A. Fairlamb A.H. Croft S.L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2655-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The development of more potent TryR inhibitors would be facilitated by high resolution structures of TryR-inhibitor complexes. Although one structure of the T. cruzi TryR-quinacrine complex has been solved, the resulting model was unfortunately of low resolution and only showed a single quinacrine molecule bound in one of the four active sites that are present in the asymmetric unit (18Jacoby E.M. Schlichting I. Lantwin C.B. Kabsch W. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Proteins. 1996; 24: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This model is inconsistent with subsequent studies that showed that enzyme inhibition is produced by multiple quinacrine molecules binding to the enzyme (19Bonse S. Santelli-Rouvier C. Barbe J. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These conflicting data encouraged us to extend these studies using quinacrine mustard (QM) as a high affinity probe to characterize the quinacrine-binding sites in TryR. This is an alkylating derivative of quinacrine in which the quinacrine diethylamino group has been replaced by the reactive bis-(2-chloroethyl)amino mustard group (Fig. 1). Here we show that QM is an active site-directed irreversible inhibitor of TryR. A structure of the resulting covalent TryR-QM adduct was obtained that demonstrated that two QM molecules stack in the TryR active site. The kinetics of the inactivation reaction were studied in detail, and these data were found to be entirely consistent with the crystallographic model of the interactions between QM ligands. These results therefore provide a structural explanation for the multisite inhibition of TryR by quinacrine (19Bonse S. Santelli-Rouvier C. Barbe J. Krauth-Siegel R.L. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 5448-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with implications for the future design of tight binding and irreversible inhibitors. Materials—Recombinant T. cruzi TryR was purified as previously described (20Borges A. Cunningham M.L. Tovar J. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Glutathione reductase was purified to homogeneity from outdated human blood donations (21Worthington D.J. Rosemeyer M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Trypanothione was purchased from Bachem. Quinacrine and QM were obtained from Sigma. Cosubstrate NADPH was purchased from Melford Laboratories. All other reagents were standard commercial products and of the highest available purity. Trypanothione Reductase Assay—The concentrations of stock solutions of T[S]2 were determined by titration with TryR and determining the change in NADPH absorption at 340 nm, following total substrate depletion. TryR was quantified spectrophotometrically using the absorption coefficient of 11.3 mm-1 cm-1 at 464 nm (22Shames S.L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3519-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). TryR activity was assayed at 27 °C using either a Shimadzu UV-2401 or a UV-1601 temperature-controlled spectrophotometer in 1-ml assays containing 40 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 μm NADPH, and 100 μm T[S]2 unless stated otherwise. Quinacrine Mustard Inactivation Kinetics—Inactivation reactions were carried out in assay buffer containing 40 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA at room temperature, using 1 μm TryR or NADPH-reduced TryR and varying amounts of QM. The residual activity of inactivation mixtures was determined at various time points by initiating TryR assays with 10-μl samples (100-fold dilution) of this inactivation mixture. The resulting data were then fitted using nonlinear regression to a single exponential decay function using the program GraFit (Erithacus Software Limited) written by R. J. Leatherbarrow. All of the activities are expressed as percentages of the activity of a parallel control lacking QM. Measurement of QM-TryR Stoichiometry—NADPH-reduced TryR (1 μm) was inactivated with 10 μm QM, and the aliquots were removed at intervals. Inactivation was quenched by adding 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 25 mm, and the residual activities were determined as described above. Trichloroacetic acid was added to each sample (20% (w/v) final concentration) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Denatured protein was recovered by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and washed twice with acetone (at -20 °C) to remove residual QM and FAD. The protein pellet was then digested with proteinase K (0.1 mg ml-1) in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA for 4 h at 56 °C, and covalently bound QM was quantified spectrophotometrically using a millimolar absorption coefficient of 7.9 mm-1 cm-1 at 424 nm. Synthesis of the Adduct of Melarsen Oxide with Dihydrotrypanothione (Mel T)—T[SH]2 was produced from T[S]2 by reduction with a 1.5-fold excess of Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine dissolved in Buffer A (10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.8). The melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (Mel T) was prepared by mixing 10 μmol of T[SH]2 with 10 μmol of melarsen oxide in 0.85 ml of buffer A. The resulting mixture was then applied at 1 ml min-1 to a 1 ml (0.5 × 5 cm) Amersham Biosciences Mono S HR 5/5 cation exchange column that had been pre-equilibrated with 5 column volumes of buffer A. After washing the column with 5 column volumes of buffer A, Mel T was eluted by a linear gradient of 0-100% buffer B (500 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.8). Under these conditions, Mel T eluted at ∼100 mm ammonium acetate. The product was then lyophilized, redissolved in 1 mm HCl, and stored at -20 °C Mass Spectrometric Analysis of QM-TryR Adduct—A sample of TryR (20 μm) was reduced with NADPH (150 μm) mixed with 100 μm QM, and inactivation was monitored by enzymatic assay as described above. When 95% inactivation had been achieved, the reaction was stopped by addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 25 mm. Another control sample was run in parallel without QM. Both samples were dialyzed extensively against water, diluted 2-fold with 40 mm NH4HCO3 and digested with trypsin (6.25 μg ml-1) overnight at 30 °C. Aliquots (1 μl) were spotted onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization sample target and allowed to dry before addition of 1 μl of matrix (10 mg ml-1 α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50:50 water acetonitrile, 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid). The dried samples were then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in reflectron mode. The peptide masses identified were then compared with a theoretical digest of the protein. Crystallographic Methods—A sample of 1 mg of TryR (20 nmol of active site) in a volume of 1.2 ml was reduced with 500 nmol of NADPH and inactivated with 40 nmol of QM. Upon complete inactivation, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to 10 mm, and the protein was exchanged into 100 mm (Na+) malate pH 6 and concentrated to 15 mg ml-1. Crystallization experiments concentrated on previously reported conditions (23Zhang Y. Bond C.S. Bailey S. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), namely 13 mg ml-1 TryR-QM adduct in Na+ malate buffer at pH 6.0 and ∼20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 as a precipitant. Only one suitable crystal was obtained, and the rest were twinned or too small for use. Because we were unable to identify cryoprotection conditions for these TryR crystals, the sample was placed in a capillary with a drop of mother liquor for use in diffraction experiments. The data were collected on BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at room temperature from a single crystal (approximate dimensions 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.3 mm) with a MAR image plate as detector, and the x-ray wavelength was set at 1.00 Å. The space group is P43 with unit cell dimensions of a = 93.1 Å, c = 156.6 Å, and the crystal was found to be isomorphous with those previously obtained of the enzyme by itself or in complex with substrate (13Bond C.S.

Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All data were processed, reduced, and scaled using the HKL suite of programs (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar) and then analyzed using the CCP4 software package (25Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Four percent of the diffraction data, 1228 reflections, were reserved for cross-validation using the Rfree parameter (26Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Subsequent positional and temperature factor refinement employing tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, a bulk solvent correction, and anisotropic scaling produced a model suitable for rebuilding in the graphics program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Several rounds of rebuilding, the conservative addition of ordered solvent molecules and refinement produced a model with R and Rfree values less than 0.30. At this point interpretation of omit electron density in each active site was made using the coordinates for quinacrine (reference code QUIANC10, (29Courseille C. Busetta B. Hospital M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1973; 29: 2349-2355Crossref Google Scholar) obtained from the Cambridge Structural Database) (30Fletcher D.A. McMeeking R.F. Parkin D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1996; 36: 746-749Crossref Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Geometric restraints for refinement were generated taking into account the likely protonation state at pH 6.0. Although the electron density clearly indicates the orientation of the tricyclic ring systems, it is not of sufficient clarity to distinguish between S- and R-isomers at C-19, both of which are present in the Cambridge Structural Database entry QUIANC10. Accordingly, the S-isomer was arbitrarily chosen for model building. Minimal residual difference density and temperature factors consistent with those of the rest of the structure were obtained by refining the quinacrine moieties at half-occupancy. The final model contains a TryR dimer, four quinacrine moieties, two FAD molecules, one maleic acid, and 53 ordered water molecules. The average temperature factor for all atoms is consistent with the Wilson thermal parameter derived from the diffraction data processing. The Ramachandran analysis (31Laskowski R.A. Macarthur M.W.

Additional experimental details are presented in Table I. Reaction of Quinacrine Mustard with Trypanothione Reductase—Both oxidized (E) and NADPH-reduced (EH2) forms of TryR show time-dependent inactivation by 20 μm QM (Fig. 2). This effect was specific for TryR because exposure of reduced human glutathione reductase to 100 μm QM for 30 min did not cause any inhibition. Inactivation can be rapidly quenched, but not reversed, by the addition of a large excess of 2-mercaptoethanol to remove any unreacted inhibitor (Fig. 2A, arrow). Moreover, inactivation could not be reversed by dilution of the enzyme-inhibitor complex or by extensive dialysis (not shown). However, QM-inactivated TryR could be readily visualized under ultraviolet light in SDS-PAGE gels because of the intense fluorescence of the acridine moiety (Fig. 3). In addition to a fluorescent band at 55 kDa corresponding to the TryR monomer, a faint band at 110 kDa is visible in NADPH-reduced samples, suggesting that a minor amount of cross-linking between subunits of the native homodimer also occurs. Together these findings indicate that inactivation involves covalent modification of the enzyme.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE of trypanothione reductase inactivated by quinacrine mustard. TryR (0.1 mg ml-1) was incubated with or without NADPH (150 μm) and QM (20 μm) for 10 min, and the reaction was quenched by the addition of excess 2-mercaptoethanol (25 mm). The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and examined under UV illumination followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. A, Coomassie-stained gel.

Inactivation of the EH2 form is about 8-fold faster than that of the E form (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the sulfydryl groups of the redox-active Cys53 and/or Cys58 in the active site could be a preferential target for alkylation. To test this possibility we examined the effects of competitive inhibitors of the T[S]2-binding site on the kinetics of inactivation (Fig. 2B). Mel T, a conjugate of T[SH]2 and melarsen oxide, is a competitive inhibitor of TryR from T. brucei with a Ki value of 9 μm (33Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, Mel T was found to be a linear competitive inhibitor of T. cruzi TryR (Ki = 15.5 ± 0.8 μm). As shown in Fig. 2B, Mel T protects the EH2 form of the enzyme from inactivation by QM. The pseudo-first order rate constants for inactivation of EH2 enzyme in the presence (k′obs = 0.072 ± 0.004 min-1) and absence (kobs = 0.32 ± 0.03 min-1) of Mel T (i = 40 μm) were fitted to the following equation, which describes protection by a simple competitive inhibitor (34Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). k′obs=kobs/(1+i/Ki)(Eq. 1) This yielded a Ki for Mel T of 12 μm, in good agreement with the directly determined value of 15.5 μm. This result suggests that QM alkylates TryR within the T[S]2-binding site. Stoichiometry and Sites of Alkylation by Quinacrine Mustard—To determine the stoichiometry of the inactivation process, samples of TryR were reduced with NADPH and exposed to QM for different time intervals, the reaction was quenched by the addition of excess 2-mercaptoethanol, and the resulting samples were assayed for residual activity. Alkylated protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, washed to remove unbound QM, and redissolved by digestion with proteinase K for spectrophotometric determination of bound QM (Fig. 4). The number of moles of QM bound per mole active site shows a limit of 1.7 ± 0.2, consistent with 2 mol of QM being covalently bound per mole of inactive TryR monomer. Moreover, because 50% inactivation is associated with 1 mol of QM bound per total monomer, it can be deduced that the majority of the inactive EH2 form of the enzyme has 2 mol of QM bound per monomer. To determine the sites of alkylation, protein samples were inactivated as above, quenched with mercaptoethanol, dialyzed, and digested with trypsin. The resulting matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flighty mass spectrometry spectra clearly showed that the peptide fragment C (residues 32-61, 3041.6 Da) bearing Cys53 and Cys58 disappeared on incubation with QM, indicating that this fragment was undergoing modification. However, although a number of new peptide fragments were observed, we were unable to unambiguously identify a predicted product (e.g. monoalkylated peptide C + QM - HCl, mass = 3774 Da; bis-alkylated peptide C + QM - 2HCl, mass = 3437 Da; or a mixed adduct between peptide C from TryR, QM, and 2-mercaptoethanol, mass = 3516 Da). Although modification of this peptide could have suppressed its ionization, another possible explanation for this anomalous behavior is discussed below. Inhibition Kinetics of Quinacrine Mustard—Inactivation of TryR by QM is also dose-dependent for the E and EH2 forms of the enzyme (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). Formation of the QM-TryR covalent adduct could either proceed as a simple bimolecular reaction or through a reversible binary complex. The difference between a general chemical modifier and an active site-directed irreversible inhibitor is that the latter can form significant amounts of dissociable complex with enzyme (EI) prior to irreversible covalent modification of the enzyme (E*I) as shown in the following scheme (35Brocklehurst K. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).E+I↔KiEI↔K2E*ISCHEME 1 The apparent rate of irreversible inhibition (kobs) is described by the following equation, where Ki is the dissociation constant for QM, and k2 is the rate constant for conversion of EI to E*I. This equation takes the same form as the Michaelis-Menten equation, giving a rectangular hyperbola when kobs is plotted against inhibitor concentration (i) (36Carlson G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 789: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 37Jung M.J. Metcalf B.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). kobs=k2·i/(Ki+i)(Eq. 2) When i << Ki Equation 2 reduces to kobs≈k2·i/Ki(Eq. 3) from which the “specificity constant for inhibition” (k2/Ki) can be determined. In the oxidized (E form) of the enzyme, a plot of kobs versus [QM] shows a linear relationship over the range of inhibitor concentrations that we were able to examine (Fig. 5C, closed circles). This result suggests that either no appreciable amount of reversible EI complex is formed or that Ki is greater than 40 μm. The slope of this plot yields k2/Ki = 15.8 m-1 s-1 for the E form. In contrast, the NADPH-reduced TryR (EH2 form) gives a hyperbolic plot (Fig. 5C, open circles), indicating that a reversible TryR-QM complex is formed prior to irreversible chemical modification of the enzyme. Fitting the data to the above equation yields an apparent Ki of 41 ± 8 μm and k2 of 0.69 ± 0.09 min-1 for QM. (k2/Ki = 280 m-1 s-1). Assuming that the residue(s) alkylated in the E form is also available for alkylation in the EH2 form, subtraction of the inactivation rate present in the E form from the EH2 form gives the kinetics of inactivation at the redox-active cysteine site (Fig. 5C, diamond symbols). This yields an apparent Ki of 36 ± 8 μm and k2 of 0.58 ± 0.08 min-1 for QM. (k2/Ki = 269 m-1 s-1), which is 17-fold faster than for the E form of the enzyme. Protection and Acceleration of QM Inhibition by Tricyclic Inhibitors—The observation that an EI complex is formed as an intermediate in the reaction between the EH2 form of TryR and QM suggests that inactivation could be prevented by competition with quinacrine. However, when increasing concentrations of quinacrine were coincubated with NADPH-reduced TryR and 10 μm QM, the rate of inactivation was initially increased over that produced by QM alone (Fig. 6A, open circles). This effect was greatest at a quinacrine to QM ratio"

The proapoptotic effects of tumor necrosis factor-α, hypoxia, and chemotherapeutic drugs were attributed to increased ceramide formation. Here we investigated the protective role of nitric oxide (·NO) during hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated transferrin receptor (TfR)-dependent iron signaling and apoptosis in C2-ceramide (C2-cer)-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs). Addition of C2-cer (5–20 μm) to BAECs enhanced ·NO generation. However, at higher concentrations of C2-cer (≥20 μm), ·NO generation did not increase proportionately. C2-cer (20–50 μm) also resulted in H2O2-mediated dichlorodihydrofluorescein oxidation, reduced glutathione depletion, aconitase inactivation, TfR overexpression, TfR-dependent uptake of 55Fe, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol, caspase-3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Nw-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), a nonspecific inhibitor of nitricoxide synthases, augmented these effects in BAECs at much lower (i.e. nonapoptotic) concentrations of C2-cer. The 26 S proteasomal activity in BAECs was slightly elevated at lower concentrations of C2-cer (≤10 μm) but was greatly suppressed at higher concentrations (>10 μm). Intracellular scavengers of H2O2, cell-permeable iron chelators, anti-TfR receptor antibody, or mitochondria-targeted antioxidant greatly abrogated C2-cer- and/or l-NAME-induced oxidative damage, iron signaling, and apoptosis. We conclude that C2-cer-induced H2O2 and TfR-dependent iron signaling are responsible for its prooxidant and proapoptotic effects and that ·NO exerts an antioxidative and cytoprotective role.

Briefly, 0.2 μCi/ml 55Fe (ferric chloride) was added to the medium for 0–8 h, and its levels were measured as a function of time. Cells were washed twice with DPBS and lysed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the cell lysate was counted in a beta counter.Western Blotting of TfR, PARP, Hsp-70, and Bcl-2—After the treatment with C2-ceramide, the cells were washed with ice-cold DPBS and resuspended in 150 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium fluoride) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin inhibitors. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). The lysate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet out the nuclei. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g. Protein was determined by Lowry method, and 20 μg of the lysate was used for the Western blot analysis. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were washed with TBS (140 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% skim milk to block the nonspecific protein binding. Membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml mouse anti-human transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), mouse anti-bovine poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), mouse anti-human Hsp-70 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) or hamster anti-human Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) in TBST for 2 h at room temperature, washed 5 times, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for TfR, PARP, Hsp-70, and mouse anti-hamster (1:5,000) for Bcl-2 for 1.5 h at room temperature. The band was detected using the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences).Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release—The release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytosol in C2-ceramide-treated BAECs was measured according to the methods as described previously (17Tampo Y.

Atherosclerosis. 2002; 162: 93-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAECs were washed with DPBS and homogenized in PBS supplemented with 40 μg/ml saponin. Lysate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min and followed by 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction to measure the released cytochrome c into the cytosol by Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (BD Pharmingen). Detection was by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody using the ECL method.Measurement of Caspase Activities—Cytosolic enzymatic activities of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were measured as described previously (26Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with DPBS following treatment with C2-ceramide and then lysed with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm CHAPS and 5 mm dithiothreitol. After cytosolic fraction was taken by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, the activities of caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were measured using the substrates of ac-DEVD-pNA (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide), ac-VEID-pNA (acetyl-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp-pNA), ac-IETD-pNA (acetyl-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-pNA), and ac-LEHD-pNA (acetyl-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-pNA) respectively. The absorbance at 405 nm of the released pNA was monitored in a spectrophotometer and quantitated using a pNA standard.Measurement of Apoptosis by TUNEL Assay—The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used for microscopic detection of apoptosis (26Kotamraju S. Konorev E.A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33585-33592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This assay is based on labeling of 3′ free hydroxyl ends of the fragmented DNA with fluorescein-dUTP catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Procedures were followed according to a commercially available kit (ApoAlert) from Clontech. Apoptotic cells exhibit a strong nuclear green fluorescence that can be detected using a standard fluorescein filter (520 nm). All cells stained with propidium iodide exhibit a strong red cytoplasmic fluorescence at 620 nm. The areas of apoptotic cells were detected by fluorescence microscopy equipped with rhodamine and FITC filters. The quantification of apoptosis was performed using the Metamorph image analysis package.Measurement of Intracellular ·NO—Intracellular ·NO levels were monitored using a DAF-2 fluorescence probe (27Kojima H.

Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Maeda D. Imai Y. Irimura T. Nagano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The treated cells were washed with DPBS and incubated in 2 ml of fresh culture medium without FBS. DAF-2 was added at a final concentration of 10 μm, and the cells were incubated for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with DPBS and maintained in 1 ml of culture medium for monitoring the fluorescence using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 610 nm) equipped with an FITC filter. The values of fluorescent intensity were calculated using the Metamorph software.Measurement of Aconitase Activity—BAECs were washed twice with cold DPBS and lysed with buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, and 5 mm citrate in PBS. The activity of aconitase was measured in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm dl-trisodium isocitrate. An extinction coefficient for cis-aconitate of 3.6 mm-1 at 240 nm was used (29Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Measurement of Glutathione—The level of glutathione (GSH) was measured by HPLC as the o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) adduct at pH 8.0 (30Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5502) Google Scholar). BAECs were washed twice with DPBS, suspended in 250 μl of PBS, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min, 200 μl of the clear supernatant was derivatized by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with OPA. An aliquot of sample was injected onto a Kromasil C-18 column and eluted isocratically with a mobile phase consisting of 150 mm sodium acetate:methanol (91.5:8.5, v/v). The OPA-GSH adduct was monitored using a fluorescence detector operating at excitation and emission wavelengths at 250 and 410 nm, respectively. The levels of intracellular GSH were quantified using a GSH solution as a standard.Proteasome Function Assays—For 26 S proteasome, proteasomal activity was measured as previously reported (31Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar, 32Pajonk F. Riess K. Sommer A. McBride W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with buffer I (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4/2 mm dithiothreitol/5 mm MgCl2/2 mm ATP) and homogenized with buffer I containing 250 mm sucrose. Twenty micrograms of 10,000 × g supernatant was diluted with buffer I to a final volume of 1 ml. The fluorogenic proteasome substrates SucLLVY-AMC (chymotrypsin-like) and Z-Leu-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (trypsin-like) were added in a final concentration of 100 and 80 μm, respectively. Proteolytic activity was measured by monitoring the release of the fluorescent group 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (excitation, 380 nm; emission, 460 nm).RESULTSCeramide Induces Intracellular Superoxide and Hydrogen Peroxide—Intracellular ROS levels were measured in BAECs treated with different concentrations of C2-cer for different time periods. The oxidation of DCFH, a nonfluorescent probe, to a fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was used to measure intracellular H2O2-derived oxidants. Although H2O2 itself does not react with DCFH to form DCF, it was proposed that intracellular peroxidases or redox-active metal ions could catalyze the oxidation of DCFH to DCF in the presence of H2O2 (17Tampo Y. Kotamraju S. Chitambar C.R. Kalivendi S.V. Keszler A. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Rota C. Fann Y.C. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28161-28168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Results show that C2-ceramide induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in DCF staining (Fig. 2, A–C). DCF fluorescence was noticeable in cells treated with 20 μm ceramide and reached a maximum in cells exposed to 50 μm C2-ceramide for 8 h (Fig. 2, B and C). The oxidation of the probe gradually increased over a 2- to 8-h time period in cells treated with 50 μm C2-ceramide. Incubation with an inactive form of ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, lacking a double bond did not induce any appreciable DCF green fluorescence (Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the active C2-ceramide induces intracellular oxidant generation as detected by DCF fluorescence.Fig. 2Ceramide-induced superoxide and H2O2 generation in endothelial cells using hydroethidine and dichlorodihydrofluorescein probes.A, BAECs were treated with various concentrations of C2-ceramide (a–d) or 50 μm of C2-dihydroceramide (e) for 8 h. Also cells were treated with 50 μm C2-ceramide for different time periods (f–j). After the treatments the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with DPBS and subsequently incubated with 10 μm DCFH-DA (A) or 10 μm dihydroethidium (D) for 20 min. The cells were then washed with DPBS and maintained in 1 ml of DMEM. The green fluorescence characteristic of DCF (A–C) and red fluorescence caused by ethidium (D–F) were measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine filters, respectively, in a Nikon fluorescence microscope. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Next, we determined the effect of C2-cer in cells treated with dihydroethidium (DHE), a fluorescent probe that reacts with superoxide to form a characteristic red fluorescence. Recent reports indicate that superoxide anion reacts with dihydroethidium to form a product that is distinctly different from ethidium (34Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (D–F), there was a dose- and time-dependent increase in the intensity of red fluorescence with ceramide treatment, indicative of enhanced superoxide generation. Again the inactive form of C2-cer, C2-dihydroceramide, did not induce red fluorescence in cells treated with HE (Fig. 2, D and E).Ceramide-induced 55Fe Uptake and TfR Expression—We determined the role of transferrin iron in ceramide-induced apoptosis and oxidant formation in endothelial cells by measuring TfR levels and 55Fe uptake. BAECs were treated with different concentrations of C2-cer for various time periods as described in Fig. 3C, and TfR levels were measured under these conditions. Results show that ceramide treatment increased TfR levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). TfR levels were found to be significantly increased by 2 h with 50 μm C2-ceramide (Fig. 3B). The inactive analog of C2-ceramide did not appreciably affect TfR levels in BAECs. Consistent with the increase in TfR levels, the uptake of 55Fe was considerably increased in C2-ceramide-treated cells (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment with anti-TfR antibody inhibited ceramide-induced 55Fe uptake (not shown). These results clearly indicate a definite role for Tf-iron in ceramide-induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells.Fig. 3The effect of C2-ceramide on transferrin receptor levels and iron uptake in endothelial cells. BAECs were treated with different concentrations of C2-ceramide (A) and for different time periods either with 50 μm C2-ceramide or 50 μm C2-dihydroceramide (B) and transferrin receptor levels were measured by Western analysis using a monoclonal anti-TfR antibody. C, BAECs were treated with 50 μm C2-ceramide for various time periods along with 0.2 μCi/ml 55Fe, and the uptake of the labeled iron was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are representative of three separate experiments. *, significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with untreated conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Ceramide-induced Apoptosis in Endothelial Cells—To investigate the mitochondrial involvement in ceramide-induced apoptosis, we measured the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Incubation of BAECs with C2-ceramide for 8 h caused a dose-dependent increase in the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol (Fig. 4A). BAECs treated with 50 μm of C2-ceramide induced a decrease in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 located on the outer membrane of the mitochondria (Fig. 4B) as well as in the Hsp-70 protein levels (Fig. 4B). We then identified the actual caspase family (caspases 3, 6, 8, and 9) that was activated during ceramide-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4, only the activity of the effector caspase-3 began to increase as early as 4 h in ceramide-treated cells, reaching a peak value by 8 h. In addition, the increase in caspase-3 activity was detected in cells only when the concentration of C2-ceramide exceeded 20 μm (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the caspase-3 activation was not evident in BAECs treated with an inactive analog of C2-ceramide, namely C2-dihydroceramide (Fig. 1). Although there was a marginal increase in the activation of caspase-6 and caspase-8 (Fig. 4, E and F), their significance in C2-ceramide-induced apoptosis was not apparent, because their activities became noticeable only at 16 h; at this time poin"
https://openalex.org/W2012279880,"Two novel antimicrobial peptides named theromacin and theromyzin were isolated and characterized from the coelomic liquid of the leech Theromyzon tessulatum. Theromacin is a 75-amino acid cationic peptide containing 10 cysteine residues arranged in a disulfide array showing no similarities with other known antimicrobial peptides. Theromyzin is an 86-amino acid linear peptide and constitutes the first anionic antimicrobial peptide observed in invertebrates. Both peptides exhibit activity directed against Gram-positive bacteria. Theromacin and theromyzin cDNAs code precursor molecules containing a putative signal sequence directly followed by the mature peptide. The enhancement of theromacin and theromyzin mRNA levels has been observed after blood meal ingestion and upon bacterial challenge. In situ hybridization revealed that both genes are expressed in large fat cells in contact with coelomic cavities. Gene products were immunodetected in large fat cells, in intestinal epithelia, and at the epidermis level. In addition, a rapid release of the peptides into the coelomic liquid was observed after bacterial challenge. The presence of antimicrobial peptide genes in leeches and their expression in a specific tissue functionally resembling the insect fat body provide evidence for the first time of an antibacterial response in a lophotrochozoan comparable to that of holometabola insects."
https://openalex.org/W2096844175,"Functional N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors are formed from the assembly of NR1 and NR2 subunits. When expressed alone, the major NR1 splice variant and the NR2 subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), reflecting a quality control mechanism found in many complex multisubunit proteins to ensure that only fully assembled and properly folded complexes reach the cell surface. Recent studies have identified an RRR motif in the C terminus of the NR1 subunit, which controls the ER retention of the unassembled subunit. Here we investigated the mechanisms controlling the ER retention of the NR2 subunit and the export of the assembled complex from the ER. We found that Tac chimeras of the C terminus of the NR2B subunit show that an ER retention signal is also present in the NR2B subunit. In assembled complexes, ER retention signals on the individual subunits must be overcome to allow the complex to leave the ER. One common mechanism involves mutual masking of the signals on the individual subunits. Our data do not support such a mechanism for regulating the release of assembled NMDA receptors from the ER. We found that the motif, HLFY, immediately following transmembrane domain 4 of the NR2 subunit, is required for the assembled complex to exit from the ER. Mutation of this motif allowed the assembly of NR1 and NR2 subunits into a complex that was functional, based on MK-801 binding, but it is retained in the ER. These results are consistent with HLFY functioning as a signal that is necessary for the release of the assembled functional NMDA receptor complex from the ER.

Co-assembly of NR1 and NR2 subunits is required to form a functional channel, generally considered to be a tetramer containing two NR1 and two NR2 subunits (1Wenthold R.J. Prybylowski K. Standley S. Sans N. Petralia R.S. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 335-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NR3 subunits can assemble with NR1 alone to form a glycine receptor (2Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S. Sevarino K.A. Nakanishi N. Tong G. Lipton S.A. Zhang D. Nature. 2002; 415: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), and they also can have a modulatory role on NR1/NR2 complexes by associating in a yet undefined fashion (3Das S. Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Takasu M. Crandall J.E. Dikkes P. Conner D.A. Rayudu P.V. Cheung W. Chen H.S. Lipton S.A. Nakanishi N. Nature. 1998; 393: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NR1 is a single subunit that can be expressed in eight splice variants, which have distinct trafficking and functional properties. There are four NR2 subunits, NR2A–D, each of which differs in its distribution and developmental expressions. The type of NR2 subunit present in the complex has a major impact on the functional properties of the channel. For example, NR1/NR2A channels display rapidly desensitizing currents and close association with the synapse compared with NR1/NR2B channels (4Rumbaugh G. Vicini S. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10603-10610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tovar K.R. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4180-4188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors is a major determinant of NMDA receptor-mediated activity and localization in the central nervous system. Several splice variants of NR1 and different subunits of NR2 are present in the same neurons, leading to multiple receptors with different functional and trafficking properties (6Kew J.N. Richards J.G. Mutel V. Kemp J.A. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1935-1943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a neuron that expresses NR2A and NR2B subunits can contain three functionally distinct receptors: NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B, and NR1/NR2A/NR2B. The process by which an NMDA receptor is assembled from its individual subunits and trafficked to synaptic and extrasynaptic sites remains poorly understood. The major NR1 splice variant (NR1-1) and the NR2 subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed alone in heterologous cells, but when expressed together, they assemble to form functional receptors that reach the cell surface (7McIlhinney R.A.

The major splice variant NR1-1 is retained in the ER in its unassembled state because of an RRR motif in its C1 cassette. NR1 subunits with other configurations of their C termini, NR1-2, NR1-3, and NR1-4, are not retained either because they lack the C1 cassette and the RRR motif (e.g. NR1-2 and NR1-4) or because they also contain the C2′ cassette (NR1-3). The C2′ cassette has a PDZ binding domain, which can negate the RRR retention motif found in the C1 cassette. When assembled with NR2, the nature of the NR1 splice variant does affect trafficking of the NR1/NR2 complex with complexes containing the NR1-1 splice variant, resulting in reaching the cell surface more slowly than the other splice variants that are not ER-retained (11Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the ER retention of the NR2 subunit has not been investigated. It is retained in the ER when expressed in the absence of NR1 in heterologous cells (7McIlhinney R.A. Le Bourdelles B. Molnar E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and in neurons lacking the NR1 subunit (13Fukaya M. Kato A. Lovett C. Tonegawa S. Watanabe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with NR2 retention caused by a signal in its cytoplasmic domain, similar to that of the NR1 subunit. For other multisubunit complexes in which individual subunits are retained in the ER in their unassembled forms, such as potassium channels and the GABAB receptor, the retention of the individual subunits is masked by an interaction between the subunits that allows the assembled complex to exit from the ER (14Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 15Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For example, the GABAB receptor contains two subunits, GABABR1 and GABABR2. GABABR1 contains an RXR retention motif in its cytoplasmic C terminus, which is masked by an interaction with the GABABR2 C terminus through a coiled coil interaction. Such a mechanism allows for release of only those complexes that are properly assembled with the correct stoichiometry of subunits. Based on the results of studies from other ion channels and receptors, a similar mechanism may be involved in releasing properly assembled NMDA receptors from the ER.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—Polyclonal anti-Tac (Research Diagnostics) and monoclonal anti-Tac (7G7, ascites) antibodies were used as described previously (8Standley S.

The required portions of the NR2B C terminus were generated by PCR with the XbaI and EcoRV sites engineered at the appropriate ends. The mouse NR2BFLAG construct (17Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used as the background for the mutant NR2B constructs used in this study. Truncations were made by incorporating a stop codon (TGA) in the appropriate place using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Because antibody binding to the FLAG epitope produced relatively weak staining, this could not be used in the measurement of surface expression of NR2 constructs. To address this, the NR2B construct without the FLAG tag was used along with an antibody to the native NR2B subunit (17Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alternatively, an NR2B construct with a GFP tag in its N terminus (20Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was used. NR2B0 and NR2B6 were constructed using the GFP-NR2B construct as well as with the NR2BFLAG construct. The cDNA sequence of rat GABAB receptor was selected (obtained from the GenBank™ data base, accession number AF109405) to make the NR1/GABABR1 chimera. Two primers (5′-gatctaTCTAGAatgcgcaggctgatcacc-3′ and 5′-gatcta TCTAGAtcacttgtaaagcaaatgtac-3′) were designed and used in PCR cloning of the DNA sequence encoding the C-terminal tail for GABABR1 from TM7 to the end, using the rat brain QUICKCLONE cDNA library (Clontech) as a template. An XbaI restriction site was introduced at the end of NR1-1 in an existing pcDNA3.1-based YFP-NR1-1 vector (20Luo J.H. Fu Z.Y. Losi G. Kim B.G. Prybylowski K. Vissel B. Vicini S. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 42: 306-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The XbaI-treated vector and PCR fragment were ligated with T4 ligase. All point mutations were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified using DNA sequencing.Expression in Heterologous Cells—Heterologous cells, including HEK 293, COS7, and HeLa cells, were cultured and transfected using the calcium phosphate method or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The NR1 and NR2B receptor subunit clones in the mammalian expression vector pCIS were transfected at a ratio of 1:3 or 1:5, respectively. Where necessary, the transfected cells were grown in the presence of 1 mm ketamine (Research Biochemicals International) to prevent excitotoxic cell death.Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membrane was blocked overnight in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The primary antibodies were diluted in 2.5% nonfat dried milk/PBS and were applied to the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies were detected using donkey anti-rabbit or mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) (Amersham Biosciences). The secondary antibody was detected using ECL.Immunofluorescence—For cell surface labeling, COS7 or HeLa cells grown on circular coverslips were washed in cold PBS2+ (with calcium and magnesium) and blocked with PBS/bovine serum albumin (PBS2+ with 0.2% bovine serum albumin) on ice for 15 min. This blocking solution was also used in diluting the first and secondary antibodies. After incubation on ice for 30 min in the primary antibody, the cells were briefly washed in cold PBS2+ followed by incubation on ice with the secondary antibody for another 30 min. The stained cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and mounted with ProLong Antifade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes). Intracellular labeling of the heterologous cells was performed in a similar manner as surface labeling, except for fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS before incubation with antibodies. After fixation, cells were treated with 5% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin in PBS2+ followed by incubation with primary and secondary antibodies at room temperature.Immunoprecipitation—Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS 24 h after transfection. Cells were collected by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Cells were lysed using 10 passes of a Dounce glass homogenizer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at (27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in a solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors at 1.5 mg/ml and solubilized by gently agitating for 1 h at 4 °C. After dilution to 1 mg/ml protein in solubilization buffer, the soluble material was collected by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). Samples of 10% of the total volume were taken from the soluble preparation for later analysis. The remaining supernatant was incubated with either 5 μg of the anti-NR1-C2 antibody or 5 μg of IgG overnight at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot of protein A was added and mixed by rotation for 4 h at 4 °C. For experiments using the M2 FLAG-agarose, the pellet was washed three times in solubilization buffer. The precipitated material was eluted from the beads by heating to 75 °C for 8 min in the presence of sample buffer and dithiothreitol. Both the samples of the soluble preparation and the precipitated material were analyzed by Western blotting.Cell Surface ELISA—Cell surface assays using the monoclonal anti-Tac antibody were performed on transfected HeLa cells as described previously (8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For the studies using HEK 293 cells, the following protocol was used. Cells were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates. Twenty-four h post-transfection, cells were washed and fixed for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS. For surface staining, cells were blocked in a 4% nonfat dried milk/PBS solution for 30 min prior to incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h. For permeabilized staining, the blocking stage was preceded by 5 min of incubation with 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS. The primary antibody was detected using donkey anti-rabbit or mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000). After four 10-min washes in 4% milk/PBS, 800 μl of K Blue substrate (Neogene) was added for 25 min. The absorbance was determined within 30 min at 650 nm. The anti-NR2B was used at a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml.Cell Cytotoxicity—HEK 293 cells were transfected with NR1 and NR2B constructs. Twenty hours post-transfection, cell cytotoxicity was determined using the Promega Cytotox 96TM cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (19Chazot P.L. Coleman S.K. Cik M. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24403-24409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Radioligand Binding—[3H]MK-801 binding was performed with cell homogenates prepared from HEK 293 cells transfected with either NR1-1a/NR2B or NR1-1a/NR2BAAAA. The assay was performed in 50 mm Tris citrate, pH 7.1. Aliquots (20 μg) of the cell homogenates were incubated in the presence of 20 nm [3H]MK-801 at room temperature for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was defined using 100 μm thienylcyclohexylpiperidine. The reactions was terminated by rapid filtration through GF/B filters pretreated with 1% polyethyleneimine followed by three washes with phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C using a Brandel cell harvester.RESULTSAn ER Retention Domain Is Present in the C Terminus of the NR2B Subunit—NR2 subunits are retained in the ER in heterologous cells (7McIlhinney R.A. Le Bourdelles B. Molnar E. Tricaud N. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and in neurons (13Fukaya M. Kato A. Lovett C. Tonegawa S. Watanabe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4855-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), in the absence of NR1. Previous studies from several laboratories have shown that the NR1-1 splice variant is retained in the ER in the absence of NR2 because of an RXR retention signal in the C1 cassette of the C-terminal domain. To determine whether a retention signal is also present in the C-terminal domain of NR2B, we constructed chimeras of the NR2B C terminus and the α chain of the interleukin-2 receptor (Tac) (Fig. 1A). Using these chimeras, we could investigate the properties of the NR2B C terminus isolated from the rest of the molecule following an approach used previously for the NR1 subunit (8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Wild type Tac is constitutively expressed on the cell surface, but appending segments of proteins to its cytoplasmic C terminus allows analysis of trafficking information contained within those segments. Chimeras containing the entire C terminus of NR2B completely eliminated surface staining of Tac, suggesting that a retention signal is present in the C terminus of NR2B (Fig. 1, B and C). Immunocytochemical staining of cells transfected with TacNR2B showed extensive co-localization with ER markers (Fig. 1D). A series of deletions of the TacNR2B construct was made to identify the region of the molecule containing the ER retention information. We have shown previously that Tac chimeras of the distal part of the NR2B C terminus (Ala-1315–Val-1482) are trafficked to the cell surface, indicating the absence of an ER retention signal in this region of the molecule (21Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune Ly C. Ehlers M.D. Wenthold R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Truncation at His-1119 showed no surface label, whereas truncations at Tyr-1070 and Tyr-985 showed increasing degrees of surface expression (Fig. 1C). Quantification of surface expression using ELISA, in which the data are expressed as the ratio of surface label to total label, showed increases in surface expression in constructs terminated at Tyr-1070 and Tyr-985 (Fig. 1C). An RRR-(1110–1112) motif, which is the motif shown to be responsible for ER retention of NR1-1 as well as other proteins, is found between His-1119 and Tyr-1070; however, mutation of the RRR motif to AAA did not increase surface expression of the full-length TacNR2B construct (data not shown). Two other potential retention signals, KRRK-(1079–1082) and KKR-(1090–1092), are present in this segment, but mutation of these sites, in addition to mutation of the RRR site, did not change surface expression of the TacNR2B construct (data not shown). The graded increase in surface expression with truncations of TacNR2B and the lack of changes in surface expression with elimination of the leading consensus retention motifs suggest that either multiple sites are involved in retention of the NR2B C terminus or that a more complex structure is responsible for the retention.Export of Assembled NMDA Receptors from the ER Is Not the Result of Interaction of C Termini and Masking of ER Retention Signals on NR1 and NR2—Complex proteins assembled from subunits that contain ER retention signals must use a mechanism to functionally mask the ER retention signals to allow the assembled complex to leave the ER. In some cases, this is done by an interaction of cytoplasmic domains of the subunits that leads to a structural masking of the retention signals. For example, the individual subunits of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels contain ER retention motifs that are masked after the assembly of the subunits, which leads to the correct stoichiometry of the channel (14Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Previous studies of the NR1 subunit (8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 9Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and our present results on NR2B indicate the presence of ER retention signals on the cytoplasmic C termini of both subunits and suggest that C termini of the two subunits may interact and mutually mask their retention signals. Two approaches were used to determine whether mutual masking is involved. We first investigated whether the cytoplasmic domains of NR1 and NR2 interact. This was carried out using a yeast two-hybrid screen by cloning NR1 and NR2B C termini into the vectors pGBT9 and pACT2 and by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using detergent-solubilized (1% Triton X-100) preparations of HeLa cells transfected with TacNR2B1-644 and TacNR1-1a (8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In neither case was any interaction found (data not shown). These findings suggest that the NR1 and NR2B C termini do not directly interact and tend to rule out interaction as a mechanism of masking their retention sites. It is possible, however, that masking is not the result of direct interactions of the cytoplasmic domains but, rather, results from an interaction involving other areas of the molecule. Also, an interaction between the two C termini may depend on the assembly of the two subunits to properly position the C-terminal domains for interaction. Thus, in isolation, the C termini may not interact. To address these points, we constructed a chimera of NR1 and the GABABR1 subunit. The GABAB receptor contains two subunits, GABABR1 and GAB-ABR2, which must assemble to form a functional receptor (15Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 16Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14643-14648Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The GABABR1 subunit contains an RXR ER retention motif, and this motif is masked in the assembled receptor by interaction of the two cytoplasmic C termini through a coiled coil interaction. The NR1/GABABR1 chimera contains the cytoplasmic C terminus of GABABR1, which includes the RXR motif (Fig. 2A). When expressed alone, the chimera is not trafficked to the cell surface following a pattern like that of NR1-1 or GABABR1, indicating that the retention signal is functioning properly. Previous studies have shown that the RRR motif is the only ER retention signal present on the NR1 molecule, and elimination of the motif allows the unassembled subunit to reach the cell surface (8Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). If masking is involved in negating ER retention of the NR1/NR2B complex, the NR1/GABABR1 chimera should not be trafficked to the cell surface because the foreign retention signal will not be masked by the NR2B subunit, which does not contain the coiled coil domain necessary for interaction to occur. We found, however, that the chimera assembles with NR2B and reaches the cell surface to form functional receptors (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that masking of the retention signals is not required for the assembled NMDA receptor to exit the ER and reach the cell surface.Fig. 2Chimeras of NR1/GABABR1 assemble with NR2 and form functional receptors on the cell surface. A, a chimera of NR1 and the C terminus of GABABR1 was transfected into COS7 cells alone or with NR2B. This chimera contained the NR1 molecule through TM4 and four amino acids of its C terminus (bold). Two linker amino acids (SR) were used to make the chimera, and the remaining sequence is from the C terminus of GABABR1. Underlined amino acids represent the coiled coil domain, and italicized amino acids are the ER retention motif. B, the chimera is present on the cell surface when expressed with NR2B but not when expressed alone. C, cell surface receptors are functional based on a cell death assay. Data are expressed as a percentage of cell death relative to that observed with cells transfected with NR1/NR2B. Values are the average of two experiments performed in triplicate (NR2B, 36.0 and 36.3%; NR1-GABAB Chimera/NR2B, 68.1 and 67.5%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)A Motif in the Proximal C Terminus of the NR2B Subunit Is Required for Cell Surface Expression of NR1/NR2B Receptors—To investigate in more detail the role of the NR2B C terminus in the trafficking of NMDA receptors from the ER, we made a series of truncations of the full-length NR2B subunit and studied the effects on the cell surface expression of the assembled receptor. We found that removal of all but six amino acids of the NR2B C terminus still produced receptors that reached the cell surface when co-expressed with NR1 in heterologous cells (Fig. 3A). These subunits form functional ion channels when expressed in cultured cerebellar granule cells (Fig. 3B). These findings are consistent with those of previous studies (22Vissel B. Krupp J.J.

Cells possess antioxidant systems, including intracellular antioxidants and ROS scavenging enzymes, that control the redox state and prevent cell damage. In addition to intracellular antioxidants, certain growth factor receptors can be activated under oxidative stress and trigger downstream cell survival signaling cascades. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) is a primary modulator of lymphatic endothelial proliferation and survival. Here, we provide evidence that activation of VEGFR-3 signaling in response to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promotes endothelial cell survival. Treatment with H2O2 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 and its association with the signaling adaptor proteins Shc, growth factor receptor binding protein 2, Sos, p85, SHP-2, and phospholipase C-γ. Of note, a hereditary lymphoedema-linked mutant of VEGFR-3 was not phosphorylated by H2O2 treatment. Isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), α and δ, were also tyrosine-phosphorylated after H2O2 stimulation. However, only the δ isoform of PKC was required for H2O2-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. The tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 or isoforms of PKC was completely inhibited by treatment with 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine, a specific inhibitor for Src family kinases, indicating that Src family kinases are upstream of PKC and VEGFR-3. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type but not the lymphoedema-linked mutant form of VEGFR-3 in porcine artery endothelial cells significantly enhanced the activation of Akt after H2O2 stimulation. Consistent with these biochemical changes, we observed that expression and activation of the wild-type but not the mutant form of VEGFR-3 inhibited H2O2-induced apoptosis.

Low levels of ROS are regularly produced during physiological metabolism. To control the redox state, cells possess antioxidant systems that comprise intracellular antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, glutathione, α-tocopherol, and several ROS scavenging enzymes including catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. Cells undergo oxidative stress when levels of ROS exceed the counter-regulatory antioxidant capacity of the cells, either generated from elevated production and accumulation of ROS or from a diminution in cellular antioxidant defenses (1Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to oxidative stress can be as different as cell death, growth arrest, proliferation, or transformation, which are dependent on the stress stimuli, dose or time of exposure, cell type, and surrounding cell environment encountered (1Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar, 2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar). ROS-mediated cell damage is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease (2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7425) Google Scholar). Exposure to relatively high doses of ROS, such as H2O2, induces death in many cell types. Oxidative stress-induced cell death involves either necrosis attributable to toxic oxidative damage to cellular lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins or apoptosis resulting from the activation of cell death signaling cascades (1Martindale J.L.

On the other hand, oxidative stress can also trigger the activation of certain signaling pathways that protect against cell death, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (4Wang X. Martindale J.L.

In some cell types, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt in response to ROS appears to be mediated by the stimulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (6Wang X.

The activation of epidermal growth factor receptor thus protects against ROS-mediated cell death induced by oxidative stress (6Wang X. McCullough K.D. Franke T.F. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Oncol. 2001; 18: 461-466PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the activation of growth factor receptors and downstream signaling may serve as another protective mechanism against oxidant-mediated cell damage in addition to oxidative scavenger enzymes. Endothelial cells are primary targets of oxidative stress. Upon exposure to ROS, endothelial cells display a variety of adverse biological effects including the production of inflammatory mediators (18Shono T. Ono M. Izumi H. Jimi S.I. Matsushima K.

Addition of exogenous ROS also induces cell death in endothelial cells. ROS-induced endothelium damage or dysfunction is considered to be a primary pathogenetic mechanism in various cardiovascular diseases (24Lum H. Roebuck K.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 280: C719-C741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ROS may also play a role in angiogenesis. ROS has been reported to induce the production of various angiogenic factors (25Sorescu D. Griendling K.K. Congest. Heart Fail. 2002; 8: 132-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent reports have shown that VEGF stimulation elevates the levels of intracellular ROS in endothelial cells, and that ROS is functional as a second messenger and participates in vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 downstream signaling cascades (26Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 27Colavitti R. Pani G.

VEGFR-3 (VEGFR-3/FLT4) is an orphan receptor for the VEGFRs VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 (28Galland F. Karamysheva A. Pebusque M.J. Borg J.P. Rottapel R. Dubreuil P. Rosnet O. Birnbaum D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1233-1240PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF-C and VEGF-D have been identified as the ligands for VEGFR-3 (29Joukov V. Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Chilov D. Lahtinen I. Kukk E. Saksela O.

VEGFR-3 is predominantly expressed in the lymphatic endothelium of adult tissues and serves as a marker that identifies lymphatic endothelial cells (31Kaipainen A. Korhonen J.

VEGFR-3 is perhaps the most important regulator of lymphatic development and lymphangiogenesis (32Dumont D.J. Jussila L. Taipale J. Lymboussaki A. Mustonen T. Pajusola K. Breitman M. Alitalo K.

In this report, we present evidence that H2O2 can stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGFR-3 receptor, induce its downstream signaling cascade to activate Akt, and thereby promote endothelial cell survival under redox stress. The VEGFR-3 mutants identified in patients with hereditary lymphoedema lack this signaling function, making the lymphatic endothelium especially prone to oxidative damage. Reagents and Antibodies—Recombinant rat VEGF-C, which can activate human VEGFR-3, was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for human VEGFR-3 (FLT4), rabbit polyclonal antibody for human c-Src, and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (PY) monoclonal antibody PY99 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Rottlerin (3′-[(8-cinnamoyl-5,7-dihydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-yl)methyl]-2′,4′,6′-trihydroxy-5′ methylacetophenone) was obtained from Calbiochem. H2O2 was purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membrane were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B and GammaBind plus Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and alpha 1 antitrypsin and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Calcium and potassium-free phosphate-buffered saline was obtained from Invitrogen. [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl]tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was purchased from Sigma. Cells and Cell Culture—HMEC-1, a human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line, was kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from Clonetics Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) and expanded in EGM-2 medium. Five to eight passages were used in the described experiments. Porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs) and culture medium were obtained from Cell Applications, Inc. (San Diego, CA). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Stimulation of Cells by H2O2—Subconfluently cultured endothelial cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 h. Various concentrations of H2O2 were prepared from an 8 m stock solution (Sigma) just before each experiment. Cells were then stimulated with various doses of H2O2 or VEGF-C for different time periods as indicated at 37 °C. In some treatments, cells were incubated with various inhibitors as indicated in each figure legend. After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (37Wang J.F. Zhang X.F. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, identical amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with different primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antibody-antigen complexes was performed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose or GammaBind plus Sepharose. After washing with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Each experiment was repeated at least three times, and the presented blots are representative ones. DNA Constructs, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Transfection—The expression construct of the wild-type VEGFR-3 or the mutant form of VEGFR-3, with a Gly to Arg mutation at the 857 site, was generated as described previously (37Wang J.F. Zhang X.F. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For transient expression of wild-type or mutant VEGFR-3 in PAECs, Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the cell survival assays, cells were trypsinized and replated in 96-well plates and then cultured overnight before the treatment with H2O2. Dominant-negative Src (K296R/Y528F) cDNA in the pUSEamp or control vector was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). For transient expression of dominant-negative Src in HMEC-1 cells, FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 5 h and then stimulated with H2O2. Cell lysates were prepared as described above for the immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Total Cellular Phosphatase Activity Assay—Serum-starved HMEC-1 cells were stimulated with H2O2. Then, cells were lysed in phosphatase lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 30 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (2 μg/ml each)). The protein phosphatase activity was measured by using para-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate with the Phosphatase Assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of para-nitrophenyl phosphate produced in the assay reaction was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Cell Survival Assays—HMEC-1 cells or PAECs were plated in collagen-coated 96-well plates and cultured overnight before treatment with various doses of H2O2. H2O2 or control medium was directly added into the culture medium and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were next washed twice with culture medium and cultured for 24 h. Cell survival was determined by using the MTT assay, which determines mitochondrial activity in living cells. 0.1 mg/ml MTT was incubated with the analyzed cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Dark blue formazan crystals that formed in the living cells were dissolved by adding 100 μl of Me2SO. The optical absorbency was measured at 550–650 nm. Results represent the means of three experiments, and cell survival is expressed as the percentage of control. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. of data obtained from three or more experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. Differences were considered as significant at p of 0.05 or less. H2O2 Induces the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in HMEC-1 Cells and DMVECs—HMEC-1, an immortalized endothelial cell line, was originally derived from dermal microvascular endothelial cells (DMVECs) (38Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMEC-1 cells possess many of the properties of normal primary endothelial cells (38Ades E.W. Candal F.J. Swerlick R.A. George V.G. Summers S. Bosse D.C. Lawley T.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bouis D. Hospers G.A. Meijer C. Molema G. Mulder N.H. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We found that HMEC-1 expressed robust levels of VEGFR-3. To assess whether H2O2 activated VEGFR-3, we first examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in HMEC-1 cells after stimulation with 1.0 mm H2O2 for various times or, in another experiment, used different doses of H2O2 for a set time of 10 min. The tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was measured by precipitation with an anti-VEGFR-3 antibody, followed by Western blotting with an anti-PY monoclonal antibody (PY99). Western blotting with an anti-VEGFR-3 antibody was used to verify equal protein loading. As shown, H2O2 stimulation increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in both a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). A significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was detected with H2O2 concentrations as low as 0.05 mm (Fig. 1B, upper panel). The H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was detected as early as 1 min, reached a maximum at 30 min, and declined thereafter but was still detectable after 60 min (Fig. 1A, upper panel). This was in contrast to the VEGF-C-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3, which peaked at 5 min and declined to basal level 30 min after stimulation (data not shown). To confirm that the H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was attributable to ROS, the stimulation with H2O2 was performed in the presence of catalase or N-acetylcysteine, a scavenger of ROS and precursor of glutathione. As shown in Fig. 1C, both catalase (1000 units/ml) and N-acetylcysteine (4 mm) inhibited the H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. We verified that equal amounts of VEGFR-3 were present in each lane of these blots (Fig. 1, A–D, lower panels). To exclude the possibility that VEGFR-3 phosphorylation induced by H2O2 was mediated through autocrine stimulation by its natural ligands, HMEC-1 cells were stimulated with H2O2 (1.0 mm) or VEGF-C (50 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the recombinant human VEGFR-3/Fc chimera protein (VEGFR-3/Ig). VEGFR-3/Ig has been shown to bind to both VEGF-D and VEGF-C and to block ligand/receptor binding (33Makinen T. Jussila L. Veikkola T. Karpanen T. Kettunen M.I. Pulkkanen K.J. Kauppinen R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 induced by VEGF-C was blocked by VEGFR-3/Ig, whereas the H2O2-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was not inhibited in the presence of VEGFR-3/Ig. These results indicated that the H2O2-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was not mediated by the release of cognate ligands. We then investigated the effect of H2O2 on the activation of VEGFR-3 in primary endothelial cells (DMVECs) exposed to various doses of H2O2 or to VEGF-C for 10 min. We observed that H2O2 induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 in DMVECs in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). In addition, VEGFR-3 also was activated when the receptor was transiently expressed in PAECs, 293 cells, or NIH-3T3 cells (data not shown), indicating that the H2O2-induced phosphorylation was not cell type-dependent. Activation of VEGFR-3 by H2O2 Involves Activation of PKC and SFK and Inhibition of Phosphatase—Previous reports have suggested that ROS can activate PKC in different cell types (40Konishi H.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29986-29994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 induced by H2O2 involved the activation of PKC. Before exposure to H2O2 or VEGF-C stimulation, HMEC-1 cells were pretreated with Go6976, a selective inhibitor for PKCα or rottlerin, a selective inhibitor of PKCδ, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 was then examined. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment with rottlerin but not Go6976 decreased the level of VEGFR-3 phosphorylation in response to H2O2 stimulation as compared with the Me2SO control, whereas neither inhibitor altered the VEGF-C-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3. Pretreatment with GF109203X, a broader selective inhibitor for various isoforms of PKC, also inhibited the H2O2-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 (Fig. 3B). These results suggested that H2O2-mediated receptor activation involved PKC, and most likely the δ isoform but not the α isoform. H2O2 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKC α and δ and activates their kinase activity in a phospholipid-independent manner (40Konishi H. Tanaka M. Takemura Y. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Kikkawa U.

Although the mechanism whereby H2O2 activates PKC isoforms is not clear, it has been demonstrated that PKC, at least the δ isoform, can be activated by SFKs both in vitro and in vivo (42Gschwendt M.

Ca2+ influx through TRPV5 is tightly controlled by modulators of Ca2+ homeostasis, including 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dietary Ca2+. However, little is known about intracellular proteins that interact with TRPV5 and directly regulate the activation of this channel. By the use of cDNA microarrays, the present study identified 80K-H as the first protein involved in the Ca2+-dependent control of the epithelial Ca2+ channel TRPV5. 80K-H was initially identified as a protein kinase C substrate, but its biological function remains to be established. We demonstrated a specific interaction between 80K-H and TRPV5, co-localization of both proteins in the kidney, and similar transcriptional regulation by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dietary Ca2+. Furthermore, 80K-H directly bound Ca2+, and inactivation of its two EF-hand structures totally abolished Ca2+ binding. Electrophysiological studies using 80K-H mutants showed that three domains of 80K-H (the two EF-hand structures, the highly acidic glutamic stretch, and the His-Asp-Glu-Leu sequence) are critical determinants for TRPV5 activity. Importantly, inactivation of the EF-hand pair reduced the TRPV5-mediated Ca2+ current and increased the TRPV5 sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+, accelerating the feedback inhibition of the channel. None of the 80K-H mutants altered the TRPV5 plasma membrane localization nor the association of 80K-H with TRPV5, suggesting that 80K-H has a direct effect on TRPV5 activity.

Furthermore, these two channels possess unique functional characteristics among the highly heterogeneous group of TRP channels (6Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev.

They exhibit a constitutively activated Ca2+ permeability, a high Ca2+ selectivity, and a Ca2+-dependent feedback mechanism regulating channel activity (7Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J.

TRPV5 activity is controlled by various regulatory mechanisms ranging from long-term transcriptional modulations to short-term direct physical interactions with intracellular factors. TRPV5 is regulated at the transcriptional level by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3), dietary Ca2+, and 17β-estradiol (5van Cromphaut S. Dewerchin M. Hoenderop J.G. Stockmans I. van Herck E.

Previous studies have shown that these hormones and dietary Ca2+ normalize the hypocalcemia in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-1α-hydroxylase knock-out mice, which is accompanied by an up-regulation of TRPV5 mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, TRPV5 modulation occurs at the post-translational level by controlling translocation of the channel from intracellular pools to the plasma membrane. Recently, the S100A10-annexin 2 complex was demonstrated to modulate the functional plasma membrane distribution of TRPV5 by direct association to the carboxyl (C)-terminal tail of the channel. Down-regulation of annexin 2 inhibited TRPV5-mediated currents in TRPV5-transfected cells (11van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Finally, the terminal tails of the channel contain potential regulatory motifs, such as protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites, PDZ motifs, and ankyrin repeats (4Hoenderop J.G. Vennekens R. Muller D. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Bindels R.J. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 747-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This suggests a regulatory role for the intracellular tails of TRPV5 in the (in)activation or the trafficking of the channel. In line with this observation, Niemeyer et al. (13Niemeyer B.A. Bergs C. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Trost C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3600-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TRPV6 is competitively regulated by PKC and calmodulin. The aim of the present study was to identify novel regulators of Ca2+ reabsorption via TRPV5. To this end, cDNA microarray experiments were performed to identify candidates that exhibit a similar transcriptional regulation to well known proteins involved in Ca2+ transport. Analysis of the data pointed to a PKC substrate, 80K-H, of which the biological function remains unclear. The putative role of this protein in active Ca2+ reabsorption was investigated by immunohistochemical, biochemical, and electrophysiological analysis of 80K-H interacting with TRPV5. DNA Constructs and cRNA Synthesis—TRPV5 constructs were generated as described previously (11van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of 80K-H wild-type protein was amplified from total mouse kidney cDNA material, cloned into the pCINeo/IRES-GFP vector (14Trouet D. Nilius B. Voets T. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Pflügers Arch. 1997; 434: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) as an EcoRI-NheI fragment, and subsequently subcloned into the pGEX6p-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and the pT7Ts vector (15Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Using in vitro mutagenesis (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), three mutants of 80K-H were generated in the pCINeo/IRES GFP vector: one mutant was generated by alanine substitution of the first two aspartates of each EF-hand structure (80K-HEF), the second mutant was generated by deletion of a stretch containing 21 glutamates (80K-HΔGlu) and the third mutant was generated by deletion of the C-terminal His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) sequence (80K-HΔHDEL). The obtained mutants were subsequently subcloned into the pT7Ts and pGEX6p-2 vectors. All constructs were verified by sequence analysis. pTLN and pT7Ts constructs were linearized, and cRNA was synthesized in vitro using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase, respectively (16Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W.

Real-time Quantitative PCR—80K-H mRNA expression level was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR in kidney of 8-week-old mice (strain C57BL/6) that had received a dietary supplementation with 100 pg/g body weight of 1,25-(OH)2D3 or 2% (w/v) Ca2+ (instead of 1.1% w/v for normal diet) (9Hoenderop J.G.

The primers used were 5′-GTC CCA ATG GCA GCT TTC A-3′ and 5′-CCC GGC TGG AGA GGA TGT A-3′ and the probe 5′-TGC ACC AAC ACT GGG TAC AAG CCC T-3′. Probes were labeled with the quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (3′-ends) and the reporter dye 6-carboxyfluorescein (5′-ends) (Biolegio, Malden, The Netherlands). The expression level of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase was used as an internal control (10van Abel M. Hoenderop J.G. Dardenne O. St-Arnaud R. Van Os C. van Leeuwen J.P. Bindels R.J.

RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA from mouse brain, eye, salivary tissue, thymus, heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, stomach, duodenum, colon, kidney, prostate, testis, uterus, skin, skeletal muscle, and bone was isolated using TRIzol (GIBCO/BRL, Life Technologies, Breda, The Netherlands). Total RNA (2 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and a PCR for 80K-H was performed in a species-conserved region using the primers 5′-TAC GTC TAC CGG CTT TGC C-3′ and 5′-AGG TAC TCA CAG CGA CTG GG-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (17Hoenderop J.G. Hartog A. Stuiver M. Doucet A. Willems P.H. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc.

Briefly, mouse kidney sections were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with affinity-purified guinea pig antiserum against TRPV5 (1:100) and rabbit antiserum against 80K-H (1:500) (18Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To visualize TRPV5 and 80K-H, goat anti-guinea pig Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (1:300), a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated antibodies (1:300) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used. All negative controls, including sections incubated with pre-immune serum or conjugated antibodies solely, were devoid of any staining. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-TRPV5 Fusion Protein and Interaction Assays—pGEX6p-2 constructs were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21 and GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB). [35S]Methionine-labeled 80K-H, 80K-HEF, and 80K-HΔGlu were prepared using a reticulocyte lysate and added to GST or GST-TRPV5 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AB) in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After 2-h incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels, and visualized by autoradiography. Injection of Xenopus Oocytes and Co-immunoprecipitation—Xenopus laevis oocytes were co-injected with 5 ng of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged TRPV5 and 20 ng of 80K-H cRNA; after 48 h, injected and non-injected oocytes were subjected to total membrane isolation by centrifugation (19de Jong J.C.

The membrane fraction was incubated on ice for 60 min in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% (w/v) sucrose). After centrifugation of the lysates, supernatants were incubated with anti-HA antibody (Sigma) or rabbit anti-80K-H antibody immobilized on protein A-agarose beads (Kem-En-Tec A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) in the presence of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 16 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm CaCl2). Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-80K-H (1:10,000) and anti-HA (1:4000) antibodies, respectively. 45Ca2+-binding Assay—To study the direct Ca2+-binding properties of 80K-H, GST-fused 80K-H proteins migrated on SDS-12% PAGE gel and were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Blotted proteins were visualized with Ponceau S staining (Sigma). 45Ca2+ binding was performed as described by Maruyama et al. (20Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were thoroughly washed and incubated for 10 min with 1 μCi/ml 45CaCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After washing, the membrane was dried and 45Ca2+ binding was visualized by autoradiography. Biotinylation Assay—TRPV5, 80K-H, 80K-HEF, 80K-HΔGlu, and 80K-HΔHDEL pCINeo/IRES-GFP constructs were transfected transiently in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) 48 h after transfection; surface biotinylation was performed by incubating the cells twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). Subsequently, cells were incubated for 5 min with quenching solution (50 mm NH4Cl in PBS-CM) at 4 °C and rinsed twice with cold PBS-CM. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 1 h on ice. Lysates were added to 30 μl of Immunopure Streptavidin beads (Pierce). After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with PBS-CM, twice with lysis buffer, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Finally, biotinylated proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel, and analyzed by immunoblotting with guinea pig antiserum against TRPV5 (1:1500) and rabbit antiserum against 80K-H (1:10000). Electrophysiology—The full-length cDNAs encoding TRPV5 and 80K-H mutants were transiently transfected in HEK293, and patch-clamp experiments were performed in the whole-cell configuration, as described previously (11van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1478-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Monovalent cation currents were measured in nominal divalent-free (DVF) solutions, in which Ca2+ and Mg2+ were omitted from Krebs solution. For measuring the Ca2+ currents, Krebs was used with 10 mm CaCl2 instead of 1 mm CaCl2. The internal (pipette) solution contained 10 mm BAPTA, 20 mm CsCl, 100 mm Csaspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 4 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm HEPES-CsOH, pH 7.2. The Ca2+ concentration in the pipette was adjusted to 10 nm, 20 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 250 nm, or 1 μm by adding 0.747, 1.391, 2.880, 4.457, 6.682, or 8.916 mm CaCl2, respectively, in the presence of 10 mm BAPTA, as calculated by the CaBuf program. 2By G. Droogmans, KU Leuven; available on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/CaBuf.zip. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22 °C). Reported current densities were calculated from the current at -80 mV during the ramp protocol for the Na+ currents or at the peak amplitude in the step protocol, respectively. The software package ASCD 3By G. Droogmans, KU Leuven; available on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/winascd.zip. was used for analysis of the whole-cell data. All current amplitudes in the dose-response curves were normalized to -80 mV with 10 mm BAPTA in the pipette solution and fitted with a modified Hill function (using Origin version 7.0 software, OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Statistical Analysis—In all experiments, the data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In case of significance (p < 0.05), individual groups were compared by Student's t test. Identification of 80K-H as a Gene Regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and Dietary Ca2+—Mice, in which the renal D3-1α-hydroxylase enzyme catalyzing the 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis was inactivated, exhibited undetectable levels of 1,25-(OH)2D3, resulting in severe hypocalcemia (21Dardenne O. Prud'homme J. Arabian A. Glorieux F.H. St-Arnaud R. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3135-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We performed a microarray analysis on kidney cDNA of these 1,25-(OH)2D3-deficient mice, which were rescued by 1,25-(OH)2D3 supplementation or by dietary Ca2+ (9Hoenderop J.G. Dardenne O. van Abel M. van der Kemp A.W. Van Os C.H. St-Arnaud R. Bindels R.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1398-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Hoenderop J.G. Chon H. Gkika D.

Analysis of the gene expression data provided information about RNA transcripts important for the maintenance of the Ca2+ balance and pointed to the 80K-H protein, which is a PKC substrate containing two putative Ca2+-binding sites. 80K-H was significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level in the absence of 1,25-(OH)2D3 (79% compared with control values in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3) and up-regulated by dietary Ca2+ supplementation (189% compared with the 1,25-(OH)2D3-deficient mice). The regulation of 80K-H at the transcription level was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR analysis (from 100% to 157 ± 12% and 155 ± 7%, respectively; p < 0.05). Localization of 80K-H in Ca2+-transporting Epithelia—Tissue distribution of 80K-H was first investigated by reverse transcription PCR on mouse tissues using primers located in a species-conserved region within the 80K-H C-terminal tail. The expected 80K-H amplicon of 242 bp was detected in all tissues, including Ca2+-transporting epithelia such as kidney and duodenum (Fig. 1A). Localization of 80K-H was further studied by immunohistochemistry of mouse kidney, where immunopositive staining for 80K-H and TRPV5 was present along the apical membrane of distal convoluted and connecting tubules (Fig. 1B). Interaction of 80K-H with TRPV5—To examine the association of 80K-H with TRPV5, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the X. laevis oocyte expression system. Membrane extracts of X. laevis heterologously expressing TRPV5 and 80K-H were first immunoprecipitated with anti-80K-H antibody, and the precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. The two specific bands of HA-tagged TRPV5, corresponding to the core and the non-glycosylated proteins (23Hoenderop J.G. Voets T. Hoefs S. Weidema F. Prenen J. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 776-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), were detected in the precipitated complex (Fig. 2A). Likewise, this interaction was confirmed in the reverse manner by immunoprecipitation of TRPV5 from membrane extracts using the anti-HA antibody and subsequent immunoblotting with the anti-80K-H antibody (Fig. 2B). Ca2+-dependence of 80K-H association with TRPV5 was investigated by GST pull-down assays in the presence (1 mm CaCl2) and absence (5 mm EDTA) of Ca2+. 80K-H protein bound specifically to TRPV5 in both conditions because no interaction was observed with GST alone (Fig. 2C). Immunoblot analysis of mouse kidney lysates did not result in a specific immunopositive signal (data not shown), which is probably due to the relatively low abundance of these channels (24Nijenhuis T. Hoenderop J.G. van der Kemp A.W. Bindels R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 2731-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Endogenous immunoprecipitation of the two proteins was, therefore, not possible. Mapping of the 80K-H-binding Site in TRPV5—To determine the 80K-H binding site in TRPV5, a series of deletion mutants between positions 598 and 680 of the TRPV5 C-terminal tail was constructed. Truncated forms of TRPV5 were expressed as GST-fusion proteins and tested for their interaction with in vitro translated 80K-H protein using pull-down experiments (Fig. 2D). The interaction between the two proteins was abolished when TRPV5 was truncated at position 603, whereas truncations at positions 680 up to 608 did not disturb the interaction with 80K-H. The sequence of TRPV5 protein corresponding to the binding site of 80K-H was restricted to the short region between the positions 598 and 608. Ca2+-binding Capacity of 80K-H—80K-H contains two putative EF-hand structures and a highly negatively charged glutamate stretch that might be a Ca2+-interacting region (25Baksh S. Michalak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21458-21465Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-binding properties of 80K-H were investigated by performing a 45Ca2+ overlay assay, using 80K-H wild type and mutants of the two putative Ca2+-related regions (Fig. 3A). The first mutant was generated by substitution of the critical aspartates for alanine residues that impair Ca2+ coordination in the two EF-hands (80K-HEF mutant). The second mutant was generated by excision of the glutamate stretch (80K-HΔGlu mutant). Pull-down experiments demonstrated that mutation of 80K-H, in the regions described above, did not disturb binding to the TRPV5 C-terminal tail (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, GST-fused proteins of 80K-H were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by blotting. An equal expression level of 80K-H proteins was verified by Ponceau S staining. After incubation with 45CaCl2, the capacity of the blotted proteins to bind 45Ca2+ was determined (Fig. 4). The amino acid substitutions in the two EF-hands of 80K-H abolished the Ca2+ binding, whereas deletion of the glutamate stretch did not interfere with Ca2+ binding. GST protein alone was used as a negative control.Fig. 4Ca2+ binding analysis of 80K-H mutants. Purified GST-fused 80K-H, 80K-HEF, and 80K-HΔGlu proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted. Equal levels in protein expression were visualized with Ponceau S staining (left panel), and Ca2+-binding capacity was demonstrated by incubation of the blot with 45CaCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” and followed by autoradiography (right panel). GST protein was used as a negative control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cell-surface-associated Expression of 80K-H and TRPV5—TRPV5 plasma membrane expression was examined in HEK293 cells transfected with TRPV5 and 80K-H with a biotinylation method using Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce). TRPV5 was expressed at the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells when transfected alone and together with 80K-H. Co-expression of TRPV5 and 80K-H mutants did not significantly affect the amount of TRPV5 expression on the plasma membrane fraction. Non-transfected cells were used as a negative control (Fig. 5A). In the same experiment, the association of 80K-H with TRPV5 channels located in the plasma membrane was studied. Interestingly, 80K-H and mutants were detected in the biotinylated membrane fraction when co-expressed with TRPV5 (Fig. 5B). The endogenously and heterologously expressed 80K-H was not detected at the plasma membrane fraction in the absence of TRPV5, despite their abundant expression in the cell lysates (Fig. 5B, right panel). Thus, it could be assessed that the expression of 80K-H at the plasma membrane depends on the presence of TRPV5. Effect of Mutations in 80K-H on TRPV5 Channel Activity—The effect of endogenous 80K-HWT and mutants on TRPV5 activity was determined by whole-cell patch-clamp analysis in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 6). In line with previous results, TRPV5 conducted Na+ and Ca2+ currents, including large monovalent currents, strong inward rectification, and high Ca2+ selectivity over Na+ (7Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Prenen J. Stuiver M. Willems P.H. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Bindels R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Cells expressing either TRPV5 alone or in combination with 80K-HWT displayed similar current densities and electrophysiological properties: Na+ current at -80 mV 441 ± 149 pA/pF (n = 4) versus 562 ± 169 pA/pF (n = 6), and Ca2+ peak current 337 ± 109 pA/pF (n = 4), compared with 299 ± 162 pA/pF (n = 4) for cells expressing TRPV5 alone or TRPV5 together with 80K-HWT, respectively. Thus, expression of 80K-HWT did not significantly alter TRPV5 channel activity (p > 0.1). Co-expression of TRPV5 with the 80K-HEF, 80K-HΔGlu, and 80K-HΔHDEL mutants had no significant effect upon the shape or amplitude of the current in a nominally DVF solution (p > 0.8, p > 0.8, and p > 0.1, respectively, compared with 80K-HWT) (Fig. 6, A and C). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, TRPV5 became Ca2+-selective, and the inward Ca2+ currents exhibited pronounced inactivation during hyperpolarizing steps (Fig. 6B). In contrast to endogenous 80K-HWT, the 80K-H mutants had profound effects upon the TRPV5 currents measured in the presence of 10 mm extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 6B). Both 80K-HEF and 80K-HΔGlu reduced the peak inward current by ∼60% (p < 0.05 for both) (Fig. 6, B and D). These mutants had no effect on the extent of Ca2+ current inactivation, which was quantified as the ratio between the peak current and the current at the end of the 3-s voltage step (Fig. 6E). 80K-HΔHDEL did not affect the peak inward current (p > 0.9), but significantly delayed the Ca2+ current inactivation (p < 0.5) (Fig. 6, B, D, and E). Modulation of TRPV5 Sensitivity for Intracellular Ca2+by 80K-HEF—Currents through TRPV5 are inhibited by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (8Nilius B. Prenen J. Vennekens R. Hoenderop J.G. Bindels R.J. Droogmans G. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A 40% reduction was observed in TRPV5 expressing cells dialyzed with a solution containing 50 nm free Ca2+ when compared with an intracellular solution containing 10 mm BAPTA and no added Ca2+ (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the currents of cells co-expressing TRPV5 and 80K-HEF in nominally DVF solution were nearly blocked with 50 nm Ca2+ in the pipette, indicative of a higher sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+ than cells expressing TRPV5 solely (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7C displays normalized inward Na+ currents as a function of [Ca2+]"
https://openalex.org/W1946679440,"Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the first step in the two-step post-translational synthesis of hypusine, which is uniquely present in eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Deoxyhypusine synthase and eIF5A are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, and both are essential for cell proliferation and survival. A previous study (Liao, D. I., Wolff, E. C., Park, M.

These Form I crystals were obtained under conditions of acidic pH and high ionic strength and likely contain an inactive enzyme. Each active-site entrance is blocked by a ball-and-chain motif composed of a region of extended structure capped by a two-turn α-helix. We report here at 2.2 Å a new Form II crystal of the deoxyhypusine synthase:NAD holoenzyme grown at low ionic strength and pH 8.0, near the optimal pH for enzymatic activity. The ball-and-chain motif could not be detected in the electron density, suggesting that it swings freely and thus it no longer obstructs the active-site entrance. The deoxyhypusine synthase competitive inhibitor N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7)is observed bound within the putative active site of the enzyme in the new crystal form (Form II) after exposure to the inhibitor. This first structure of a deoxyhypusine synthase·NAD·inhibitor ternary complex under physiological conditions now provides a structural context to discuss the results of previous biochemical investigations of the deoxyhypusine synthase reaction mechanism. This structure also provides a basis for the development of improved inhibitors and antiproliferative agents. Deoxyhypusine synthase catalyzes the first step in the two-step post-translational synthesis of hypusine, which is uniquely present in eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Deoxyhypusine synthase and eIF5A are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, and both are essential for cell proliferation and survival. A previous study (Liao, D. I., Wolff, E. C., Park, M. H., and Davies, D. R. (1998) Structure 6, 23–32) of human deoxyhypusine synthase revealed four active sites of the homotetrameric enzyme located within deep tunnels. These Form I crystals were obtained under conditions of acidic pH and high ionic strength and likely contain an inactive enzyme. Each active-site entrance is blocked by a ball-and-chain motif composed of a region of extended structure capped by a two-turn α-helix.

This structure also provides a basis for the development of improved inhibitors and antiproliferative agents. Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) 1The abbreviations used are: DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase; eIF5A, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A; GC7, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane; HSS, homospermidine synthase; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. catalyzes the first of two steps in the post-translational modification of a single lysine residue of the precursor eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF5A(Lys)) to the unique amino acid hypusine (Nϵ-(4-aminobutyl-2-hydroxyl)lysine) (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DHS converts lysine to deoxyhypusine (Nϵ-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) by a NAD-dependent transfer of the butylamine moiety of spermidine. In the second step of the modification, deoxyhypusine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of deoxyhypusine, yielding hypusine. A highly interesting aspect of this post-translational modification is the extreme specificity of it. The only known endogenous occurrence of hypusine is a single modified lysine in the mature form of eIF5A. The importance of this post-translational modification is underscored by the conservation of DHS and eIF5A in all eukaryotes and archaea (2Gordon E.D. Mora R. Meredith S.C. Lee C. Lindquist S.L. J.

Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Specific inhibitors of DHS or deoxyhypusine hydroxylase result in cellular growth arrest and alter tumor cell proliferation and differentiation (5Hanauske-Abel H.M. Park M.H. Hanauske A.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2555-2561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and the interaction with exportin 4 (11Lipowsky G. Bischoff F.R. Schwarzmaier P. Kraft R. Kostka S. Hartmann E. Kutay U. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4362-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The multistep reaction catalyzed by DHS requires two substrates, spermidine and eIF5A(Lys), plus the cofactor NAD. It is proposed to proceed in four steps, employing two imine intermediates and a transient hydride (12Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

Evidence for each of these steps has been reported based on biochemical and fluorescence studies (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4793-4799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wolff E.C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9170-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The first two steps can proceed in the absence of eIF5A(Lys) yielding diaminopropane and Δ1-pyrroline. The structure of human DHS complexed with NAD was reported previously by this laboratory (15Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and will be referred to as the Form I crystal. These DHS crystals were grown in the presence of high ionic strength (1.7 m sodium/potassium phosphate) and at an acidic pH (∼4.5) at which DHS is inactive in vitro. This structure revealed that the entrance to each of the four tunnel-like active sites of the DHS homotetramer was sealed from the external milieu by a ball-and-chain motif composed of a two-turn α-helix (residues Ala11–Val17) attached to an extended loop. This compact helix obstructs the active-site entrance with the helical axis approximately perpendicular to the pathway down the tunnel. Furthermore, in the previous study the competitive DHS inhibitor 1,7-diaminoheptane was included in the crystallization mother liquor, but it was not observed in the refined crystal structure. The failure to observe bound 1,7-diaminoheptane was attributed to the obstructed active-site entryway, the acidic pH, and high ionic strength. The inaccessibility of the DHS active site suggests that the Form I structure is unlikely to be the fully active form of the enzyme. This observation prompted continued screening for alternate crystallization conditions. We report here a new crystal form (Form II) of the human DHS:NAD holoenzyme obtained under significantly different crystallization conditions, i.e. low ionic strength and pH 8.0. Importantly, in vitro assays have demonstrated that DHS is enzymatically active at this pH (16Murphey R.J. Gerner E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15033-15036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Dimitriadis E.K. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 18Lee C.H. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 851-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this new Form II crystal, the ball-and-chain motif has undergone a dramatic structural change allowing accessibility to the active sites. This structure is likely to be more representative of the active form of DHS. Furthermore, DHS Form II crystals soaked in the potent DHS competitive inhibitor, N1-guanyl-1,7-diaminoheptane (GC7) (19Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielded the crystal structure of the first DHS·NAD·inhibitor ternary complex. The observation of the spermidine analog GC7 bound in the DHS active site provides a new structural perspective to discuss mutational data, the proposed mode of spermidine binding, and the reaction mechanism. Protein Purification—Recombinant human DHS was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (13Wolff E.C. Folk J.E. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15865-15871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Crystallization—The new crystal form (Form II) of DHS was initially observed while using the Hampton Research 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) grid screen. Optimized crystallization conditions were 4.5–7.0 mg/ml DHS in 3 mm NAD, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, and 100 mm KCl combined in a 1:1 ratio with the reservoir solution (64–70% (v/v) MPD and 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0). A typical initial droplet size was 3.5 μl. The crystallization droplets were equilibrated via vapor diffusion against 1 ml of the reservoir solution at room temperature. Well formed but small crystals (∼0.1-mm maximum each dimension) grew within several days. Selected crystals were soaked in a stabilizing solution containing 64% (v/v) MPD, 2 mm GC7, 0.11 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, for several days to form the inhibitor-enzyme complex. GC7 was synthesized as described previously (19Jakus J. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13151-13159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Form II crystals were washed well with a stabilizing solution devoid of DHS, dissolved in water, and subjected to MALDI-TOF and SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). This analysis confirmed the presence of only full-length DHS in the Form II crystals. Fresh Form I crystals were grown following the published protocol (15Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) excluding 1,7-diaminoheptane. Crystals of both types were grown using DHS from the same sample aliquot. Form II crystals contain two DHS monomers/asymmetric unit, as opposed to the single monomer/asymmetric unit observed within the Form I crystal. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Crystals were flash-cooled using liquid propane. No additional cryoprotectant was required because of the high concentration of MPD. Data collection was conducted at 95 K. Initial diffraction data sets were obtained using CuKα radiation produced from a Rigaku RU-200 rotating anode and a R-Axis IIC detector. Final data sets were collected at Beamline X-9B at the National Synchrotron Light Source using monochromatic x-rays with a wavelength of 0.98 Å and an ADSC Quantum 4 CCD detector. The data were processed with the HKL package (21Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, Orlando1997: 307-326Google Scholar).

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The search model was the DHS·NAD complex from the Form I crystal (PDB code 1DHS) (15Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The unambiguous results from the rotation and translation functions were used to position two copies of the search model within the Form II asymmetric unit. CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13016) Google Scholar) programs were used for refinement and model building, respectively. A test set of reflections (2295, 4.4% of total) was randomly selected prior to refinement to calculate Rfree, to monitor the refinement progress. Bulk solvent correction and an overall anisotropic temperature factor correction were performed. Non-crystallographic symmetry 2-fold restraints were employed, with the weighting scheme guided by Rfree. Initially the noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were strong, and as the model improved, the restraints were weakened to allow the model to reflect structural discrepancies observed in the electron density. Waters were included in the model at later stages of refinement, with positions located based on peaks ≥3σ in Fo - Fc difference maps and possessing reasonable hydrogen bonding geometry. The final model included individual isotropic temperature factors. Crystals of the DHS·NAD·GC7 ternary complex were isomorphous to the Form II crystals that did not undergo the inhibitor soak, and so additional phasing information was not required to calculate an initial electron density map. However, the soaked crystals exhibited weaker diffraction intensities. GC7 molecules were built into the strong (>3σ) Fo - Fc difference density present in each active site of the DHS tetramer. The refinement scheme was similar to that described above. The test data set used to calculate Rfree was composed of reflections having the same indices as those in the test set used in the Form II DHS·NAD binary complex refinement, minimizing the bias in Rfree. No waters were included in the model of the inhibited holoenzyme because of the modest resolution of the data. The Form I DHS crystal structure was refined using newly collected data from crystals grown in parallel with the Form II crystals. This experiment was done to ensure that structural differences between the DHS Form I and the Form II crystal structures were truly because of the dissimilar crystallization conditions (e.g. pH and ionic strength) and not because of the use of different DHS sample preparations. The original Form I structure was the starting model, and refinement commenced using simulated annealing protocols in CNS. DHS in the Form II crystals exhibited several regions of structural disorder as judged by the absence of observed electron density following refinement. These regions include the N terminus (Met1-Glu27) and the C terminus (His364-Asp369) for both monomers within the asymmetric unit, and Ser78-Arg92 within monomer B only. The loop containing Ser78-Arg92 was also disordered in the Form I structure. The geometry of all final models was analyzed with PROCHECK (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were created using RIBBONS (26Carson M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar) and GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Homospermidine Synthase (HSS) Homology Model—A model of the three-dimensional structure of HSS monomer from Senecio vulgaris was constructed by the Swiss-Model Server (28Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar) using DHS as the homology template (58.1% identical, 73.8% similar). Overall Structure—DHS is present as a homotetramer in the new Form II crystal (Fig. 1A) as it was in the Form I crystal (Fig. 1B) (15Liao D.I. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Davies D.R. Structure. 1998; 6: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The only species observed corresponded to the expected molecular mass of a DHS tetramer (164 kDa) in size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering solution studies (1Park M.H. Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Biol. Signals. 1997; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Wolff E.C. Park M.H. Folk J.E. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 2T. C. Umland and D. R. Davies, unpublished data. Thus the tetramer is highly likely to be biologically relevant and not a crystal-packing artifact. The tetramer in the Form II crystal exhibits pseudo-222 symmetry, governed by a single crystallographic 2-fold and two non-crystallographic 2-fold rotational symmetry elements; whereas, the Form I tetramer exhibits strict 222 symmetry. The two unique monomers within the Form II crystallographic asymmetric unit are denoted A and B, respectively. The tetramer may be considered as a dimer of dimers. This distinction is based upon the observation that each catalytic site is comprised of residues from two monomers. Each fundamental dimeric subunit of two closely associated monomers (Fig. 1A, A1 with B1 and A2 with B2) form two complete but antiparallel active sites at their interface, with 2830 Å2/monomer buried in the Form II crystal. These two crystallographically identical dimers form a looser association, creating interfaces between monomers A1 and B2, and between monomers B1 and A2. This second interface buries 2470 Å2/monomer in the Form II crystal. No additional active sites are created by the dimer-dimer interaction. An essential question regarding DHS is why is it present as a tetramer when the fundamental catalytic unit of the enzyme appears to be a dimer? Data indicate the possible presence of negative cooperativity upon the successive binding of ligands, and the DHS tetramer appears to bind only a single eIF5A(Lys) monomer (14Wolff E.C. Wolff J. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9170-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Lee Y.B. Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Dimitriadis E.K. Park M.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fluorescence studies monitoring the conversion between NAD and NADH demonstrated that a certain population of the enzyme-bound NADH may not be readily available to reduce the eIF5A-imine intermediate in the final step of the proposed mechanism (14Wolff E.C. Wolff J. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9170-9177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These data have led to speculation that the DHS tetramer may undergo an asymmetric conformational change upon binding, either singularly or in combination, the cofactor and one or both of the substrates. The relaxed symmetry requirements for the DHS tetramer in the new Form II crystal coupled with the ability of DHS to bind GC7 within these crystals allowed for further analysis of the interplay between monomers within the tetramer. Intimate contacts formed between each monomer with each of the remaining three partners within the DHS tetramer provide additional evidence that the tetramer is required for either a regulatory mechanism or enhanced stability. For example, consider monomer A1. It interacts with monomers B1 and B2, forming the two types of dimer interfaces discussed above. More interestingly, monomer B2 contributes an N-terminal ball-and-chain motif (Fig. 1) that is capable of blocking one of the active sites formed at the A1-B1 dimer interface, as observed in the Form I crystal (Fig. 1B). Monomer A1 lacks extensive contacts with the fourth monomer, monomer A2, but the limited interactions are distinctive. First, monomer A2 contributes a ball-and-chain motif capable of blocking the entrance to the second active site formed at the A1-B1 interface. Secondly, Phe54 of monomer A2 makes extensive contacts to a loop in monomer A1 (Asp313 and Gly314) and a loop in monomer B1 (Asn106), both of which interact extensively with the NAD adenine moiety. Phe54 is present in a hairpin turn connecting two helices, possessing the unusual strained main chain geometry of ϕ ∼ 42° and Ψ ∼ -135° in both crystal forms, and is well defined by electron density. These interactions allow for a potential transmission path for a regulatory conformation change. The root mean squared deviation is 0.17 Å between the Cα atoms of the two independent monomers in the Form II crystal of the DHS:NAD holoenzyme, superimposable by a rotation of 180.0° coupled with a translation of 0.16 Å. Each NAD binding site is occupied to a comparable degree based upon a visual inspection of the electron density and the refined temperature factors. Similarly, the root mean squared deviation between the Cα atoms of the two independent monomers in the Form II crystal of the DHS·NAD·GC7 ternary complex is also 0.17 Å, and each of the NAD and the GC7 binding sites is equally occupied. Furthermore, the Form II crystals exhibited only two limited regions of the main chain possessing significant conformational differences between the two independent monomers. First, there is a lack of electron density to define the position of residues His364-Asp369, and presumably they are highly mobile. Met363 is the last residue of the chain defined by electron density, assuming different conformations in the independent monomers. Second, the loop composed of residues Ser78–Arg92 is observed within monomer A but not within monomer B of the Form II crystals. It is also unobserved within the Form I crystal structure. No function has been identified with either one of these two regions, but both human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae DHS require the presence of the five C-terminal residues for full activity (20Joe Y.A. Wolff E.C. Park M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22386-22392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Kang K.R. Chung S.I. Exp. Mol. Med. 1999; 31: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that the weights of the non-crystallographic symmetry restraints employed during refinement were carefully selected so as not to artificially force the monomers to be similar, and 2Fo - Fc omit maps calculated following a short simulated annealing protocol were used to reduce model bias. Thus, there is no structural indication from the Form II crystals that NAD alone or the combination of NAD and GC7, when present in excess stimulates negative cooperativity within DHS because of an asymmetric conformational change lowering the affinity for the successive binding of ligands. However, any potential conformational changes to the DHS tetramer resulting from the binding of eIF5A(Lys) or from less than equivalent concentrations of NAD or GC7 remains to be addressed. NAD Binding Site—The NAD cofactor binds to a Rossmann dinucleotide-binding motif present within the core of the DHS monomer (Fig. 1C). A subdomain is inserted into this motif following strand β2, partially forming the active site. The DHS polypeptide chain is extended on both the N- and C-terminal sides of the dinucleotide-binding motif. The NAD cofactor is bound in the canonical manner to the Rossmann fold of monomer A but is also subjected to an interaction with monomer B involving a loop (Thr308–Lys329) following strand β5. This loop also contributes crucial residues to the catalytic active site. The NAD buried surface area due to interactions with monomer A and B are ∼476 and ∼294 Å2, respectively. The majority of the NAD-binding interactions are similar to those observed in the Form I crystal. However, in the Form I crystal Oϵ-2 of Glu137 interacts with the amide nitrogen of the nicotinamide ring. In the Form II holoenzyme crystal, this residue assumes a different rotamer in each of the two independent monomers. In monomer A this side chain points away from the nicotinamide ring, hydrogen bonding to Oζ of Tyr176 and several waters, whereas Glu137 of monomer B resembles that seen in the Form I crystal. In the Form II holoenzyme·inhibitor complex, Glu137 of monomer A interacts weakly with both the nicotinamide ring and the hydroxyl group of Tyr176, and again this glutamate residue in monomer B resembles that observed in the Form I crystal.

https://openalex.org/W1979961130,"Ordered assembly of monomeric human β2-microglobulin (β2m) into amyloid fibrils is associated with the disorder hemodialysis-related amyloidosis. Previously, we have shown that under acidic conditions (pH <5.0 at 37 °C), wild-type β2m assembles spontaneously into fibrils with different morphologies. Under these conditions, β2m populates a number of different conformational states in vitro. However, this equilibrium mixture of conformationally different species is difficult to resolve using ensemble techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance or circular dichroism. Here we use electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to resolve different species of β2m populated between pH 6.0 and 2.0. We show that by linear deconvolution of the charge state distributions, the extent to which each conformational ensemble is populated throughout the pH range can be determined and quantified. Thus, at pH 3.6, conditions under which short fibrils are produced, the conformational ensemble is dominated by a charge state distribution centered on the 9+ ions. By contrast, under more acidic conditions (pH 2.6), where long straight fibrils are formed, the charge state distribution is dominated by the 10+ and 11+ ions. The data are reinforced by investigations on two variants of β2m (V9A and F30A) that have reduced stability to pH denaturation and show changes in the pH dependence of the charge state distribution that correlate with the decrease in stability measured by tryptophan fluorescence. The data highlight the potential of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to resolve and quantify complex mixtures of different conformational species, one or more of which may be important in the formation of amyloid.

These amyloid deposits have been linked to various human maladies such as Alzheimer's disease (4Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Joachim C.L. Vickers E.A. Lee G. Fritz L.C. Oltersdorf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7341-7345Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), Huntington's chorea (5Wanker E.E. Biol.

Pathol. 1984; 117: 391-399PubMed Google Scholar). However, for the majority of the ∼20 known amyloid-related proteins, the structural mechanism of amyloid formation is still unclear, and, for several proteins, the role that different aggregated states play in the manifestation of the disease symptoms remains unresolved (7Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). β2m is a small (11,860-dalton) extracellular protein that forms the nonpolymorphic light chain component of the major histocompatibility class I complex. The physiological role of β2m has been likened to a chaperone in that it is required for the heavy chain of the major histocompatibility class I complex to fold into a stable secreted entity (8Bjorkman P.J.

Zhang L. Kozlowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5630-5638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). β2m is an all β-sheet protein, with a seven-stranded β-sandwich structure and a single disulfide bond linking Cys-25 and Cys-80 in the B and F strands (10Saper M.A. Bjorkman P.J. Wiley D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 277-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In healthy individuals, the serum concentration of circulating free β2m is ∼3 mg·liter–1 (11Floege J. Bartsch A. Schulze M. Shaldon S. Koch K.M. Smeby L.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 118: 153-165PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein is removed from the serum by renal catabolism (12Karlsson F.A. Groth T. Sege K. Wibell L. Peterson P.A. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In individuals undergoing renal dialysis, the serum concentration of β2m can rise to around 50 times the levels in healthy individuals (13Mayer G. Thum J. Woloszczuk W. Graf H. Am. J. Nephrol. 1988; 8: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Gejyo F. Homma N. Suzuki Y. Arakawa M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 585-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In these patients, the deposition of predominantly full-length wild-type β2m into amyloid fibrils is inevitable, with all patients who undergo long term hemodialysis eventually developing the systemic condition, dialysis-related amyloidosis (13Mayer G. Thum J. Woloszczuk W. Graf H. Am. J. Nephrol. 1988; 8: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Partial unfolding of monomeric β2m has been shown to be required in vitro for fibrillogenesis to proceed on an experimentally tractable time scale. This can be accomplished by acidification of the solution (15McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), truncation of six amino acids from the N terminus (16Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), or the addition of Cu2+ ions (17Morgan C.J. Gelfand M. Atreya C. Miranker A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Depending on the denaturing conditions used, a number of different fibril morphologies are formed in vitro (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Kad N.M. Myers S.L. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Thomson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For example, short curved fibrils (∼200 nm) are formed at pH ∼3.6 at high ionic strength (0.4 m), whereas under more acidic conditions (pH ∼2.5) and low ionic strength (≤50 mm), longer (∼1 μm) and straighter amyloid-like fibrils are formed. Both fibril types give rise to x-ray fiber diffraction patterns typical of a cross-β structure and bind the histopathological dyes thioflavin-T and Congo red (20Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). At pH ∼3.6, β2m adopts a partially folded state, as indicated by a number of techniques including CD and the fluorescence of 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (15McParland V.J. Kad N.M. Kalverda A.P. Brown A. Kirwin-Jones P. Hunter M.G. Sunde M. Radford S.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8735-8746Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). This species is also weakly protected from hydrogen exchange and gives rise to broad resonances in NMR spectra (21McParland V.J. Kalverda A.P. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, it displays the hallmarks of a partially folded or molten globule state. At more acidic pH (pH 2.5), monomeric β2m is also weakly protected from hydrogen exchange, and, although it retains some residual structure, it is largely disordered, as determined by NMR (22Katou H. Kanno T. Hoshino M. Hagihara Y. Tanaka H. Kawai T. Hasegawa K. Naiki H. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the observed differences in the fibril morphologies formed from β2m at pH 3.6 and pH 2.5 could reflect the different conformational states of the monomeric protein under each condition, although other models, including a kinetic rather than a structural dependence of fibril morphology on pH, are also consistent with the current experimental data (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 21McParland V.J. Kalverda A.P. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A major problem in identifying which of these models is correct is that quantification of the relative concentrations of native, partially folded, and acid-unfolded states, which may be co-populated under conditions in which the protein is fibrillogenic, cannot be obtained using spectroscopic methods. This is because these techniques provide only the population-weight average property under each condition. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), however, has the unique capability of resolving multiple species that are co-populated in solution, provided that these species give rise to different charge state distributions (23Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9012-9013Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 24Mirza U. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Anal.

Matecko I. Muller N. J. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 37: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed to rationalize the observed differences in the charge state distributions of native and nonnative states. Differences in the solvent accessibility of ionizable groups (23Chowdhury S.K. Katta V. Chait B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9012-9013Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 27Ganem B. Li Y.T. Henion J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7818-7819Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar), heightened Coulomb energies of folded compared with unfolded polyprotonated conformations (28Felitsyn N. Kitova E.N. Klassen J.S. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2002; 13: 1432-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Cech N.B. Enke C.G. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2001; 20: 362-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), or the increased protection against charge neutralization offered by native protein conformations (30Grandori R. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) have all been offered as plausible explanations. Whichever mechanism or combination of processes governs this phenomenon, the net result is that conformational species with more open structures carry, on average, more charges and produce broader ion envelopes centered on higher charge states than their more compact native counterparts (31Fenn J.B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 4: 524-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Here we describe the use of ESI-MS, combined with quantitative analysis of the charge state distributions generated, to investigate the population of native, partially folded, and acid-unfolded conformers of β2m as a function of pH. Using this approach, we show that the population of different species can be quantified using ESI-MS and compared with denaturation of the protein followed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. The data are reinforced by similar analyses of two destabilized β2m mutants, V9A and F30A (20Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Jones S. Smith D.P. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These proteins adopt native-like structures at neutral pH but are significantly destabilized at lower pH. Thus, the pH at which the partially folded state first becomes significantly (>5%) populated (named herein as the N-I transition point) occurs at pH 4.8, 5.6, and 5.3 for wild-type, V9A, and F30A β2m, respectively. Similarly, titration with urea results in midpoints of 4.7, 1.6, and 2.9 m urea for wild-type, V9A, and F30A β2m, respectively (20Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Jones S. Smith D.P. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, and by contrast with wild-type and F30A β2m, V9A forms amyloid-like fibrils at neutral pH (i.e. under conditions where the protein is natively folded) (32Jones S. Smith D.P. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both variants were carefully selected from a series of mutants previously constructed as part of a systematic study on the role of global stability in β2m fibrillogenesis (20Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Jones S. Smith D.P. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) on the premise that they should possess pH stabilities significantly different from that of wild-type β2m, without dramatic perturbation of their overall gas phase proton affinities or the upper limit of charges attainable. Thus, they provide ideal controls for systematic deconvolution of the charge state distribution as a function of pH. Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma. To minimize contamination from salts, buffers were prepared in water suitable for trace inorganic analysis (Fluka, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) and acidified with volumetric standard HCl, 1.0 n (Sigma). Buffers—Careful consideration of the buffering system used was required in order to optimize the spread of the charge state distribution of β2m and hence the resolution of the different protein conformers while maintaining ESI-MS-compatible conditions. Thus, all ESI-MS experiments were carried out in a composite buffer containing 5 mm ammonium formate and 5 mm ammonium acetate. HCl rather than a volatile organic acid was used to adjust the pH to the desired value throughout the pH range, because this was found to generate the widest charge state distribution of β2m under the denaturing conditions used. In addition, salt concentrations of >10 mm were avoided, since the number of observed charge states decreased at higher ionic strengths, resulting in the loss of the high m/z ions. Fluorescence experiments and fibril growth experiments were also conducted using this buffer system as well as a higher ionic strength buffer containing 25 mm ammonium formate and 25 mm ammonium acetate. The two buffer systems are referred to as “low salt” (5 mm ammonium formate and 5 mm ammonium acetate) and “high salt” (25 mm ammonium formate and 25 mm ammonium acetate) throughout. ESI-MS—All experiments were performed on a Platform II ESI-MS mass spectrometer (Micromass UK Ltd./Waters Ltd. (Manchester, UK)) operated under MassLynx software control. The source temperature was maintained at 37 °C with capillary and cone voltages of 3.5 kV and 50 V, respectively. Samples were infused using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) at a flow rate of 20 μl·min–1. Recombinant β2m was overexpressed and purified as described previously (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Protein was dissolved in Purite deionized water (Purite Analyst HP 25, Purite Ltd., Thame, Oxfordshire, UK) at a concentration of 200 μm, syringe-filtered (0.2 μm) to remove any potential preaggregated states (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and dialyzed extensively overnight in a 3500 molecular weight cut-off Slide-a-lyser (Pierce) with 5 liters of Purite water at 4 °C. Next, samples were diluted 1:10 (v/v) with the appropriate buffer and then equilibrated at 37 °C for ∼30 min before injection. No significant differences were observed in the charge state distributions of samples infused after an incubation for several hours with the instrumental conditions used. The capillary was pre-equilibrated with 100 μl of buffer at the appropriate pH prior to sample injection. Ten 10-s spectra were acquired in multichannel analysis mode for each sample. Instrument calibration was achieved with a separate introduction of horse heart myoglobin to ensure a mass accuracy to within ±0.01%. Deconvolution of ESI-MS Spectra—All the m/z spectra were processed using a two-point smooth with a Savitsky-Golay algorithm (supplied with the MassLynx software) using a measured 1.0-dalton peak width at half height. These smoothed m/z spectra are shown in Fig. A in the Supplementary Material. Next, each of these spectra was subjected to a centroiding process, which created a centroided (or “stick”) spectrum by measuring the peak area of the top 90% of each peak in the spectrum. Each spectrum showed evidence for the protein primarily as protonated molecular ions with a varying number of charges (i.e. m/z = (M + nH)n+/n). There were also minor signals originating from salt adducts, in particular potassium. In order to account for this, the total ion current between each protonated molecular ion charge state and its corresponding dipotassium adduct ions were summed together (Fig. Aii in Supplementary Material). These new values were normalized to the base peak intensity and expressed in terms of percentage of base peak intensities (BPI). This procedure resulted in a significant improvement in the agreement between the ion currents of observed quasimolecular ions with replicate analysis. This process assumes equivalence in the capacity of different protein conformers to acquire these adducts. To fit the resulting spectra to a series of gaussian distributions, a method similar to that of Dobo and Kaltashov was used (33Dobo A. Kaltashov I.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This method assumes that the total ion current in any given ESI-MS spectrum can be described by a linear combination of a limited number of gaussian functions, each one arising from a different conformational ensemble of the protein at equilibrium. Each charge state was plotted in ASCII-XY format against its recalculated percentage of BPI (above), and the S.D., mean, and amplitude of a limited number of gaussian distributions were allowed to vary freely using PeakSolve (Thermo Electron Corp., Altrincham, UK) so that the residual error between the combined linear contribution of these gaussian functions and the experimental data was minimized. Any remaining error between the experimental data and the gaussian functions was reduced using least squares regression using Solver (Microsoft Corp.) to minimize the squared error between the sum of the gaussian amplitudes at each charge state and the corresponding charge state percentage of BPI by subtle adjustment of the S.D., mean, and amplitude of each gaussian function. The precision of each local fit was continually assessed globally during the deconvolution process. This was necessary because of the limited number of experimental observations arising from this technique (single integer values from the charge states 5+ to 15+) as well as the restricted resolution between the charge state distributions of the partially folded and acid-unfolded states of β2m, which, in some instances, resulted in more than one possible local minimized fit when both of these populations were present. The fitting process assumed that the envelope of peaks observed in each ESI-MS spectrum is made up of several ion abundance patterns I(z), each one representing one or more different protein conformers coexisting at equilibrium, and it is possible to explain each of these by normalized gaussian distribution functions, I(z)=1σ2πe−1/2⋅(χ−μσ)2 where μ and σ represent the mean and the S.D. of the distribution of charges of each of the protein conformers. These values were assumed not to vary significantly for each population throughout the pH titration. By contrast, the relative intensity (amplitude) of each function will vary depending on the extent to which each conformational ensemble is populated at each pH. Furthermore, a relationship was assumed to exist between the width of the charge state distribution (i.e. the gaussian standard deviation of each ion abundance pattern) and each conformational state, such that σ increases in the order native < partially folded < acid-unfolded. Then the population of each conformer was calculated by summation of the height, I(z), of every integer value (charge state) under each gaussian function found in each spectrum. Finally, these values were normalized as a percentage contribution of each conformer to the total ion current. Acid Denaturation of β2m Followed by Tryptophan Fluorescence— Fluorescence experiments were performed on a C-61 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International Inc., Ford, West Sussex, UK) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 327 nm, respectively. Lyophilized protein samples were dissolved in Purite water, filtered (0.2 μm), and then diluted into Purite water to a final protein concentration of 40 μm. Samples were then diluted 1:10 (v/v) into the appropriate low salt buffer and allowed to equilibrate in a 10-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma UK Ltd., Southend on Sea, Essex, UK) contained in a heated Peltier unit at 37 °C for 6 min prior to data acquisition. Under these conditions, the fluorescence signal was constant over the acquisition time. Further, both wild-type and F30A β2m showed no time-dependent signal changes over the total incubation time under these conditions. Fluorescence intensities were measured between pH 6.2 and 2.0 for 60 s and averaged for each sample; then each denaturation curve was normalized to its fluorescence intensity at pH 6.2. Comparison of Acid Denaturation Monitored by Fluorescence and ESI-MS—To compare the pH denaturation profiles of β2m measured by ESI-MS and fluorescence, the fluorescence emission of the protein at 327 nm (λ excitation 280 nm) was measured as a function of pH and compared with data computed directly from the known relative populations of native, partially folded, and acid-unfolded β2m determined by ESI-MS. This process assumes that each conformer has a different fluorescence intensity at pH 6.0 and that each signal varies linearly with pH. In addition, when comparing wild-type and F30A β2m, it was assumed that the fluorescence intensities of the partially folded and acid-unfolded states are identical in the two proteins, although the fluorescence signal of the native state of F30A is greater than that of wild-type β2m(>5% increase in fluorescence signal intensity at pH 6.0) (20Smith D.P. Jones S. Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The fluorescence value at each pH was calculated according to Equation 2, Fc=([N]⋅FlN)+([I]⋅FlI)+([A]⋅FlA) (Eq. 2) where [N], [I], and [A] correspond to the relative populations of native, partially folded, and acid-unfolded species at each pH value determined from deconvolution of the ESI-MS m/z spectra, and FlN, FlI, and FlA represent the fluorescence signals of these states at each pH value. The pH dependence of the fluorescence signal of the partially folded and acid-unfolded conformations was allowed to vary in order to achieve the best fit. Since it was possible to measure directly the fluorescence intensity of the native state of wild-type β2m and F30A β2m over the pH ranges of 6.2 to 5.0 and 6.2 to 5.6, respectively, the pH dependence of the fluorescence signal of this state was determined experimentally for these proteins and held as a constant throughout the fitting procedure. The fluorescence signals for the partially folded and acid-unfolded states were 0.57 and 0.80 at pH 6.0 (normalized to the fluorescence intensity of the native state at pH 6.2) with pH dependences of 0.05 and 0.08 units per pH value, respectively. The native state fluorescence signals at pH 6.0 were 0.99 and 0.98 for wild-type and F30A β2m, respectively, with corresponding pH dependences of 0.06 and 0.01 units per pH value. The fitting process was carried out using least squares regression between the experimentally derived equilibrium denaturation data and Fc, which was achieved using Solver (Microsoft). Fibril Formation from Wild-type β2m—Recombinant wild-type β2m was dissolved in Purite water, syringe-filtered (0.2 μm), and then dissolved 1:10 (v/v) into the appropriate buffer to give a final protein concentration of 0.2 mg·ml–1. A 0.75-ml aliquot of each solution was then placed in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Each sample was incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 6 weeks at 200 rpm. Samples were removed and visualized by electron microscopy. Electron Microscopy (EM)—Formvar carbon-coated copper EM grids were prepared and coated with protein samples as described previously (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All images were taken using a CM10 electron microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, Holland) operating at 100 keV. β2m Fibrillogenesis—In order to determine whether β2m forms amyloid-like fibrils in the volatile buffers required for ESI-MS analysis, the protein was incubated for 6 weeks at 0.2 mg·ml–1 in both the low salt and high salt buffers at pH 2.6 and 3.6 (see “Experimental Procedures”). After this time, an aliquot of each sample was taken and analyzed by negative stain EM. At pH 2.6, fibrils of β2m had formed in both the low salt and high salt buffers (Fig. 2, a and b). In the low salt buffer (Fig. 2a), the fibrils were generally longer (∼5 μm) than those formed under high salt conditions (∼1 μm) (Fig. 2b). Further, in low salt buffers at pH 2.6, the majority of the fibrils observed showed distinct periodicity, whereas in high salt buffers a mixture of single protofilaments and slightly thicker fibrils with some periodicity were observed. The latter resemble type I fibrils previously identified (18Kad N.M. Thomson N.H. Smith D.P. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) in which paired protofilaments twist around each other. At pH 3.6 (Fig. 2, c and d) the yield of fibrils was greater than at pH 2.6. In low salt buffer at pH 3.6 (Fig. 2c), the fibrils exhibited various degrees of lateral association. On average, these fibrils were longer than the fibrils formed at pH 2.6 in high salt buffers yet were shorter than those formed in low salt buffer at pH 2.6. At pH 3.6 under high salt conditions, a mass of aggregated material was observed after 6 weeks (data not shown). However, after an incubation time of 10 days under these conditions, many short fibrils were observed (Fig. 2d). Thus, under the buffer conditions required for ESI-MS, in vitro fibrillogenesis of β2m occurs, producing fibrils with morphologies that generally resemble those observed previously using nonvolatile buffers at low ionic strengths (15McParland V.J.

https://openalex.org/W2151756204,"Cdt1 is a licensing factor for DNA replication, the function of which is tightly controlled to maintain genome integrity. Previous studies have indicated that the cell cycle-dependent degradation of Cdt1 is triggered at S phase to prevent re-replication. In this study, we found that Cdt1 is degraded upon DNA damage induced by either UV treatment or γ-irradiation (IR). Although the IR-triggered degradation of Cdt1 was caffeine-insensitive, the UV-triggered degradation of Cdt1 was caffeine-sensitive. This indicates that the cells treated with UV utilize the checkpoint pathway, which differs from that triggered by IR. A recent study has suggested that Cdt1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitylated, and degraded at the G1/S boundary in the normal cell cycle. Treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, inhibited the degradation of Cdt1 and resulted in the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Cdt1 after UV treatment. In the case of UV treatment, phosphorylation of Cdt1 induced the recruitment of Cdt1 to a SCFSkp2 complex. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of Cdt1 after UV treatment interfered the inhibition of DNA synthesis. These results indicate that Cdt1 is a target molecule of the cell cycle checkpoint in UV-induced DNA damage.

These results indicate that Cdt1 is a target molecule of the cell cycle checkpoint in UV-induced DNA damage. Cdt1 is a licensing factor for DNA replication that is developmentally conserved from yeast to mammals (1Hofmann J.F. Beach D.

Cdt1 is required to form pre-replicative complexes (pre-RC) 1The abbreviation used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complexes; IR, γ-irradiation; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, ATM/Rad3-related kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase. at G1 phase, and the function of Cdt1 is tightly regulated to prevent over-replication of the genome. Thus, Cdt1 is expressed at the exit of M phase and degraded at the boundary of G1/S transition, and geminin, an inhibitor of Cdt1, is expressed from S phase to M phase (4McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W.

Once Cdt1 is aberrantly activated in cells, the cells start to over-replicate the genome, and the integrity of the genome is therefore not preserved (9Yanow S.K. Lygerou Z. Nurse P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4648-4656Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Quinn L.M. Herr A. McGarry T.J. Richardson H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Cdt1 is degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Two E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes have been suggested to play a crucial role in the degradation of Cdt1. One is the E3 ubiquitin ligase, which contains Cul4 and Roc1 (12Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the other is the SCFSkp2 complex (Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein, Skp2) (13Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, the degradation of Cdt1 can be mediated by either a Cul4-containing complex or the SCFSkp2 complex in the progression of the cell cycle. Accumulating evidence indicates that the cell cycle checkpoint plays an important role in maintenance of the genome integrity (14Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). When the genome is damaged, the initial step of the checkpoint is recognition of damaged DNA. In this step, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and ATM/Rad3-related kinase (ATR) play crucial roles. Once ATM or ATR is activated by the damaged DNA, these kinases phosphorylate down-stream substrates, and the triggered signals induce cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, or apoptosis. ATM is primarily activated by IR, which induces DNA double-strand breaks, whereas ATR responds to UV. Although these kinases are activated by different types of DNA damage, they share common substrates, which give similar biological effects. We hypothesized that Cdt1 plays an important role in the cell cycle checkpoint. In this study, we found that Cdt1 is rapidly degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway upon DNA damage induced by either UV or IR treatment. Caffeine, an ATM/ATR inhibitor (15Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), only inhibited UV-induced Cdt1 degradation. This finding implies that cells utilize caffeine-sensitive checkpoint pathways upon UV-induced DNA damage, although IR-induced Cdt1 degradation is caffeine-insensitive. After UV treatment, Cdt1 was phosphorylated, and the phosphorylation of Cdt1 triggered the recruitment of Cdt1 to the SCFSkp2 complex. We conclude that Cdt1 is rapidly degraded in response to DNA damage to prevent cells from replicating the damaged DNA. Plasmid Construction—A cDNA clone (IMAGE 304853) containing human Cdt1 cDNA was purchased from IncyteGenomics. For constructing various Cdt1 deletion mutants, each cDNA was generated by PCR, and a FLAG tag was attached at the C terminus. These mutants lack the following corresponding amino acids: dC139, amino acids 139–546; dC283, amino acids 283–546; dC445, amino acids 445–546; dN52, amino acids 2–52; dN93, amino acids 2–93. Then each cDNA of full-length and mutant Cdt1 with a FLAG tag was cloned into pBabe-Puro for retroviral vectors. For a vector of the tetracycline-inducible system, full-length Cdt1 cDNA was cloned into pTRE (Clontech). For an Skp2 expression vector, full-length Skp2 cDNA was cloned into the pCGT vector, which contains a T7 tag at the N terminus. Cell Culture, Drug Treatment, and DNA Damage—HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HCT-15 cells were obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa Tet-On cells were purchased from Clontech and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml G418. To establish HeLa cells containing a Cdt1 deletion mutant, we used a retrovirus packaging kit Ampho (TaKaRa). HeLa cells were infected with a retrovirus harboring each mutant of Cdt1 and selected with puromycin. HeLa Tet-On/Cdt1 cells were established by co-transfecting pTRE-Cdt1 and a puromycin-resistant gene and selected with both G418 and puromycin. For UV-induced DNA damage, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were treated with 20 J/m2 UV. After UV treatment, the culture medium was added back to the cells. For the treatment of inhibitors of checkpoint kinases or proteasome, the following drugs were added to the culture medium 15 min before the induction of DNA damage: caffeine (15 mm, Sigma), wortmannin (10 μm, Sigma), UCN-01 (200 nm, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo) and MG132 (50 μm, Calbiochem). Antibodies, Immunoblotting, and Immunostaining—Polyclonal antibodies against human Cdt1 and geminin were raised against glutathione S-transferase-fused C-terminal 321–546 amino acids of Cdt1 and full-length geminin, respectively. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody, T7 tag antibody, anti-actin antibody (I-19; catalog number SC-1616), and anti-Skp2 antibody (H-435; catalog number SC-7164) were purchased from Sigma, Novagen, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. For immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5%(v/v) Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) unless otherwise indicated. To analyze the phosphorylation-dependent association between Cdt1 and Skp2, immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were treated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) and then washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). For immunostaining, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and incubated with anti-Cdt1 antibody as a primary antibody and then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For DNA staining, the fixed cells were stained with 4′,6′-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride. In Vitro Ubiquitylation of Cdt1—Recombinant Cdt1 with a FLAG tag was collected by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) from HeLa-derived stable cells as described above. Recombinant Cdt1 was eluted with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5) and concentrated by Centricon YM10 (Millipore). pCGT-Skp2 was transfected into 293 cells, and the cell lysates were collected after 48 h. A pCGT empty vector was used as a negative control. To collect the cell lysates from UV-treated cells, the transfected cells were harvested 15 min after UV treatment. The SCFSkp2 complex was immunoprecipitated with a T7 tag antibody. An in vitro ubiquitylation assay was carried out with the SCFSkp2 complex and recombinant Cdt1 as described previously (17Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 19: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (687) Google Scholar). To analyze the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation, Cdt1 was pretreated with λ-phosphatase for 30 min before the in vitro ubiquitylation reaction. After the in vitro ubiquitylation reaction, the reaction mixture was analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Cdt1 antibody. To confirm that the SCFSkp2 complex was immunoprecipitated, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-Skp2 antibody. Inhibition of DNA Synthesis after DNA Damage—Either HeLa Tet-On or HeLa Tet-On/Cdt1 cells were cultured in a culture medium without doxycycline and irradiated with UV. After UV treatment, the cells were cultured with or without 1 μg/ml doxycycline. The expression level of Cdt1 after UV irradiation in either HeLa Tet-On or HeLa Tet-On/Cdt1 was examined by immunoblotting. The cells were labeled for 6 h with IdU, and the incorporated 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine was analyzed by using a DNA/IdU labeling and detection kit (TaKaRa). Cdt1 Is Rapidly Degraded through a Ubiquitin/Proteasome Pathway upon UV Irradiation—To determine whether Cdt1 plays a role in the cell cycle checkpoint, we carried out an experiment to determine whether the expression of Cdt1 is affected by genotoxic stress. Exponentially growing HeLa cells were treated with UV, and the level of Cdt1 was checked by immunoblotting. Cdt1 disappeared upon UV treatment, and this cellular response was observed within 15 min. We also examined the expression of geminin. Although Cdt1 rapidly disappeared upon UV treatment, the expression level of geminin did not change (Fig. 1A). Thus, the disappearance of Cdt1 is a specific response to UV treatment. By immunostaining with an anti-Cdt1 antibody, Cdt1 was homogeneously stained through the nucleus in most of the exponentially growing cells. After UV irradiation, Cdt1 had mostly disappeared (Fig. 1B). Since Cdt1 is degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway at the entry into S phase in the normal cell cycle (8Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Zhong W. Feng H. Santiago F.E. Kipreos E.T. Nature. 2003; 423: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we assumed that Cdt1 was degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway upon UV treatment. When cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, the degradation of Cdt1 was completely inhibited. Interestingly, the extracts of cells treated with both UV and MG132 showed not only stabilized Cdt1 but also slower migrating forms of Cdt1 (Fig. 1C). These results prompted us to check whether the alteration in electrophoretic mobility is attributed to the phosphorylation of Cdt1. HeLa cells were treated with or without UV in the presence of MG132. Then the cell extracts were subjected to phosphatase treatment. The results showed that the mobility shift of Cdt1 was dependent on UV irradiation and sensitive to λ-phosphatase (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the DNA damage induced by UV triggers phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Cdt1. We also examined the effect of IR upon Cdt1 stabilization. Cdt1 was degraded upon IR, and MG132 inhibited Cdt1 degradation induced by IR, but an electrophoretic mobility shift was not observed (Fig. 1E). Cdt1 Degradation Induced by UV Irradiation Is Caffeine-sensitive—DNA damage activates the cell cycle checkpoint, in which ATM or ATR triggers the signaling cascade. Chk1 and Chk2 are downstream kinases of ATM and ATR that mediate signals to the effectors (18Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar, 19Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Since Cdt1 was phosphorylated by UV irradiation and the degradation of Cdt1 was rapid, we assumed that this response involves the activation of checkpoint kinases. We treated the cells with UV in the presence of inhibitors of checkpoint kinases and examined the effects of the inhibitors. Caffeine is an inhibitor of ATM and ATR, wortmannin is an inhibitor of ATM and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (20Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar), and UCN-01 is an inhibitor of Chk1 (21Graves P.R. Yu L. Schwarz J.K. Gales J. Sausville E.A. O'Connor P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 22Busby E.C. Leistritz D.F. Abraham R.T. Karnitz L.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2108-2112PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that caffeine inhibited Cdt1 degradation but that wortmannin and UCN-01 had no effect (Fig. 2A). In addition, extracts of cells treated with caffeine did not show slower migrating forms (Fig. 2A, lane 3), suggesting that a caffeine-sensitive and wortmannin-insensitive molecule, possibly ATR, plays a role in the modification of Cdt1. These results indicate that Cdt1 is degraded upon UV-induced DNA damage, possibly through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, and that the activities of ATM, DNA-PK, and Chk1 are dispensable for this cellular response. Previous studies have shown that there is redundancy between Chk1 and Chk2 functions and that these kinases share common substrates in the signaling cascade of the cell cycle checkpoint (18Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar, 19Durocher D. Jackson S.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). To check the possibility that the activity of either Chk1 or Chk2 is necessary for the degradation of Cdt1, we used HCT-15 cells, which lack functional Chk2 activity (23Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 24Falck J. Lukas C. Protopopova M. Lukas J. Selivanova G. Bartek J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5503-5510Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We examined the level of Cdt1 in HCT-15 cells after UV treatment in the presence of UCN-01. We found that Cdt1 was still degraded upon UV treatment without the activity of either Chk1 or Chk2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, neither Chk1 nor Chk2 seems to be involved in the pathway for the degradation of Cdt1. We also examined the effect of kinase inhibitors upon IR-induced Cdt1 degradation. All of the kinase inhibitors used, including caffeine, had no effect on the degradation of Cdt1 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the cells utilize caffeine-insensitive checkpoint pathways upon IR-induced DNA damage. Cdt1 Is Recruited to E3 Ubiquitin Ligase, SCFSkp2 Complex, after UV Treatment in a Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—A recent study has suggested that Cdt1 is phosphorylated, ubiquitylated, and subsequently degraded at the G1/S boundary through the SCFSkp2 complex (13Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Since UV treatment induced the phosphorylation of Cdt1, we assumed that Cdt1 is recruited to the SCFSkp2 complex upon UV treatment. Since our anti-Cdt1 antibody was not suitable for immunoprecipitation analysis, we generated a HeLa-derived cell line, HeLa/Cdt1FLAG, which expressed the full length of Cdt1 with a FLAG tag at the C terminus. To prevent the accumulation of the phosphorylated form of Cdt1 in the normal cell cycle, we treated the cells with MG132 for 10 min prior to UV treatment and harvested the cells 10 min after UV treatment. Immunoprecipitation analysis with anti-FLAG M2 antibody showed that UV treatment augmented the association between Cdt1 and Skp2 (Fig. 3A). In addition, λ-phosphatase treatment of the immunoprecipitates abrogated the association, suggesting that the association of Cdt1 and Skp2 is phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 3B). We also performed an in vitro ubiquitylation assay. The SCFSkp2 complex was immunoprecipitated, and we checked that the SCFSkp2 complex ubiquitylates Cdt1 (Fig. 3C). A high molecular weight form of Cdt1 was generated by the SCFSkp2 complex (Fig. 3C, lane 3). Pretreatment of Cdt1 with λ-phosphatase decreased the generation of the high molecular weight form of Cdt1 (Fig. 3C, lane 4). We also checked that UV treatment affects the activity of SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase. The SCFSkp2 complex from the UV-treated cells showed activity of the ubiquitin ligase similar to that of the SCFSkp2 complex from the untreated cells (Fig. 3C, lane 5). Collectively, the results suggest that UV-induced phosphorylation of Cdt1 is crucial for the recognition and subsequent ubiquitylation by the SCFSkp2 complex. To determine which portion of Cdt1 is important for degradation induced by UV treatment, we established HeLa-derived stable cell lines that expressed a series of Cdt1 deletion mutants (Fig. 4A). As was reported previously (13Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), it was found that the N-terminal region of Cdt1 is necessary for association with Skp2. All of the C-terminal deletion mutants retained the ability to associate with Skp2, but two N-terminal deletion mutants lost the ability (Fig. 4B). Immunoblotting analysis showed that the N-terminal deletions, as small as 52 amino acids, totally abolished the UV-induced degradation of Cdt1. In addition, a series of C-terminal deletions showed that 138 N-terminal amino acids is sufficient for the UV-induced degradation of Cdt1 (Fig. 4C). These results are consistent with the ability of the Cdt1 mutants to associate with Skp2.Fig. 4The N-terminal region of Cdt1 is necessary for the association with Skp2 and the degradation of Cdt1 upon UV treatment.A, schematic representation of Cdt1 mutants. Wt, wild type; aa, amino acids. B, the immunoprecipitates (IP) of the cell lysates of each mutant cell line with anti-FLAG M2 antibody were immunoblotted by ant-Skp2 antibody. The deletion of the N-terminal region of Cdt1 abolished the ability to associate with Skp2. C, the N-terminal deletion mutants were not degraded upon UV treatment. Mutant cells were treated with UV, and the expression levels of Cdt1 mutants were examined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ectopic Expression of Cdt1 Interfered with the Inhibition of DNA Synthesis by UV-induced DNA Damage—Once cells suffer genotoxic stress, the cell cycle checkpoint inhibits the synthesis of DNA to prevent the accumulation of mutations. Since Cdt1 is an essential factor for the formation of pre-RC, which is necessary to start DNA synthesis, we assumed that degradation of Cdt1 leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis. Finally, we investigated whether the rapid degradation of Cdt1 upon DNA damage has any physiological effect on DNA synthesis. We established a stable cell line, HeLa Tet-On/Cdt1, in which the expression of exogenous Cdt1 is inducible by the addition of doxycycline (25Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bender G. Muller G. Hillen W. Bujard H. Science. 1995; 268: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (2051) Google Scholar). Using these cells, the level of inhibition of DNA synthesis after DNA damage was examined by determining 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine incorporation into the cells. After UV treatment, the expression of Cdt1 was induced by doxycycline (Fig. 5A). In the absence of doxycycline, parental HeLa Tet-On cells and HeLa Tet-On/Cdt1 cells showed the same extent of inhibition of DNA synthesis after DNA damage. However, in the Cdt1-induced condition, the level of inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by DNA damage was inhibited (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that degradation of Cdt1 is important for the inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by UV-induced DNA damage. The expression of Cdt1 is regulated in the cell cycle, in which Cdt1 is expressed mainly in the G1 phase and degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway after the onset of S phase (7Hodgson B.

Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A recent study has suggested that Cdt1 is phosphorylated and recruited to the SCFSkp2 complex at the G1/S transition (13Li X. Zhao Q. Liao R. Sun P. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30854-30858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Since our results suggest that the phosphorylation and degradation of Cdt1 are also induced by UV-induced DNA damage, the expression level of Cdt1 seems to be regulated by both the cell cycle stage and the cell cycle checkpoint. Once Cdt1 is degraded, it is thought that the cells fail to form pre-RC. Thus, DNA damage impairs the formation of pre-RC and results in inhibition of DNA synthesis. The SCF-Skp2 complex was initially characterized as promoting the transition of G1 phase to S phase, which mediates the ubiquitylation of p27KIP1, p57Kip2, p21CIP1, Rb-related protein p130, and cyclin E in the progression of the cell cycle (26Zhang H.

The SCFSkp2 mediates UV-dependent degradation of p21CIP1, and the degradation of p21CIP1 is essential for DNA repair (34Bendjennat M. Boulaire J. Jascur T. Brickner H. Barbier V. Sarasin A. Fotedar A. Fotedar R. Cell. 2003; 114: 599-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our study showed that Cdt1 is a target molecule of the cell cycle checkpoint that can be degraded through ubiquitylation by the SCFSkp2 complex. Taken together, the results indicate that SCFSkp2 is an essential complex not only for the cell cycle progression but for the checkpoint. It would be interesting to check the possibility that there are substrates of the SCFSkp2 complex other than p21CIP1 and Cdt1 for the checkpoint response. Upon genotoxic stress, ATM and ATR usually act as primary sensors for the damaged DNA (14Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, from our results, although the degradation of Cdt1 induced by UV treatment was inhibited by an ATM/ATR inhibitor, caffeine, it seems that the activities of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK are not essential for the degradation of Cdt1 induced by IR. A recent study has suggested that the Cul4/Roc1 complex plays a crucial role in the IR-induced ubiquitylation of Cdt1 and that degradation of Cdt1 is caffeine-insensitive (35Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). At this point, it is thought that there is an independent pathway for IR-induced DNA damage of ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK to induce the degradation of Cdt1, which should be further characterized. It is also possible that there is a functional relationship and coordination between the SCFSkp2 complex and Cul4/Roc1 complex for Cdt1 degradation in response to DNA damage. It has been reported that overexpression of Cdt1 has oncogenic potential (36Arentson E. Faloon P. Seo J. Moon E. Studts J.M. Fremont D.H. Choi K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1150-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the aberration of Cdt1 degradation may contribute to the cancer development by promoting cell cycle progression and genetic instability. We thank Shiro Akinaga for providing UCN-01."

In addition, GrpE prevented the association of peptide substrates with DnaK through an activity of its N-terminal 33 amino acids. A ternary complex of GrpE, DnaK, and a peptide substrate could be observed only when the peptide binding to DnaK precedes GrpE binding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GrpE slows down the release of a protein substrate, σ32, from DnaK in the absence of ATP. These findings suggest that the ATP-triggered dissociation of GrpE and substrates from DnaK occurs in a concerted fashion.

These findings suggest that the ATP-triggered dissociation of GrpE and substrates from DnaK occurs in a concerted fashion. Central to the chaperone functions of Hsp70 proteins is the transient interaction of their C-terminal substrate-binding domain with short peptide stretches within substrate polypeptides (1Bukau B.

This interaction is controlled by the nucleotide status of the N-terminal ATPase domain of Hsp70, which in turn is regulated by co-chaperones of the DnaJ family and for some Hsp70s by nucleotide exchange factors (4Cheetham M.L.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 5Laufen T. Zuber U. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Fink A.L. Goto Y.

It is still an unsolved question as to why for some Hsp70s nucleotide exchange factors are essential for their activity in vivo and in vitro while for others nucleotide exchange factors are not essential or do not exist (8Burkholder W.F.

Wiederkehr T. Brehmer D. Bukau B. Mayer M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32538-32544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that the nucleotide dissociation rates of Hsp70 proteins vary over a range of almost 3 orders of magnitude (12Brehmer D. Rüdiger S. Gässler C.S. Klostermeier D. Packschies L. Reinstein J. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The exchange rate of the Hsp70 homologue with the highest exchange rate was nearly as high as the exchange rate of the Hsp70 with the lowest basal exchange rate in the presence of saturating amounts of its exchange factor. This demonstrates that the molecular structure of Hsp70s does not have to be limiting for nucleotide exchange rates and suggests that an optimal exchange rate has been evolved for each system. Therefore, the question arises why nucleotide exchange factors exist and whether they have additional functions. For the essential nucleotide exchange factor of Escherichia coli DnaK (GrpE), it was suggested that it also accelerates substrate release in a nucleotide-independent manner (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was conceived first on the basis of the unusual structure of GrpE, the N-terminal part of which forms a long α-helix of 100 Å in length (amino acids 34–106) (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). This helix extends well beyond the limits of the ATPase domain, suggesting that it might interact with the substrate-binding domain of DnaK (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 33 amino acids of GrpE that were unstructured and had to be removed for crystallization were proposed to be responsible for the interaction with the substrate-binding domain of DnaK and for influencing substrate release (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In a later study (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it was claimed that even in the absence of added ATP, GrpE was able to stimulate substrate dissociation and association by 200- and 60-fold under saturating conditions. Whereas Mally and Witt (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) found the GrpE-mediated substrate release in the absence of nucleotide and in the presence of ATP, Han and Christen (15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) claim that the stimulatory effect only occurs in the presence of ADP and not in the absence of the nucleotide. Finally, it has been suggested that GrpE acts as thermometer, because its activity as a nucleotide exchange factor for DnaK is strongly thermosensitive (16Grimshaw J.P. Jelesarov I. Schönfeld H.J.

To further investigate potential novel functions of GrpE in more detail, we analyzed the effect of GrpE on the binding equilibrium and on the association and dissociation kinetics of the interaction of DnaK with peptide and proteins substrates. In addition, we removed the N-terminal 33 amino acids of GrpE (ΔNGrpE) to analyze the effects of the N terminus on peptide binding and release.

Free label was removed by dialysis against buffer T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 20). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford reaction (Bio-Rad protein assay), and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting and the specific activity (0.316 TBq·mmol–1) and labeling efficiency (0.09) was determined. Substrate Binding and Dissociation Kinetics—Peptide dissociation kinetics using fluorescent-labeled and radiolabeled peptides (σ32-Q132-Q144-C-AANS, D-NR, and [3H]VSV-GC) were performed as described previously (11Gässler C.S.

Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) with the exception that GrpE was added to the reaction mixture or included with the quench peptide at the indicated concentrations using either a stopped-flow apparatus (SX.18MV, Applied Photophysics) or a PerkinElmer LS-55 spectrofluorometer for the fluorescence measurements. For determination of association kinetics, fluorescent-labeled peptides (0.5 μm) were added to DnaK (0.5 μm) in HKM buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2) with or without 20 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4 in the absence or presence of GrpE at the indicated concentrations. Equilibrium measurements were performed essentially as described (34Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) by titrating preformed complexes of DnaK (0.5 or 1 μm) with fluorescent-labeled (0.5 μm) or radiolabeled peptides (1 μm) with GrpE. Protein substrate dissociation equilibrium experiments were performed according to a previously published protocol (35Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 2 μm [3H]σ32 and 1 μm DnaK were incubated in the absence or presence of GrpE (0.25–4 μm GrpE2) in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer T at 30 °C for at least 2 h, and then 90 μl of ice cold buffer T was added and DnaK-bound and free [3H]σ32 were separated by gel filtration over a Superdex™ 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated and developed in buffer T. Fractions of 0.5 ml in size were collected, and radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. For dissociation kinetics, 1 μm [3H]σ32 and 1 μm DnaK were incubated in the absence or presence of GrpE (1 μm GrpE2) in a final volume of 20 μl of buffer T at 30 °C for at least 2 h, 5 μm of unlabeled σ32 were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated further at 30 °C for the indicated times before analysis by gel filtration as described above. Refolding of Thermal-denatured Luciferase—Unfolding and refolding were determined as described previously (36Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) using HKM buffer with 20 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, and a DnaK:DnaJ:GrpE2:luciferase ratio of 10:2:0.25:1. Luciferase was denatured in the presence or absence of chaperones for 30 min at 42 °C, and refolding was initiated by shifting the reaction mixture to 30 °C. Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were performed using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter and a cuvette with 0.1-cm path length. Thermal-induced unfolding (15–85 °C) and refolding (85–15 °C) of 1.5 μm GrpE2 or ΔNGrpE2 were followed by continuously monitoring the relative ellipticity at 222 nm (bandwidth, 2 nm) with a scan rate of 30 °C h–1. GdnCl-induced unfolding of 1.5 μm GrpE2 or ΔNGrpE2 was achieved by a stepwise addition of GdnCl up to 5 m final concentration. Refolding experiments with 1.5 μm GrpE2 or ΔNGrpE2 were performed by dilution series from 5 to 3 m GdnCl and 3 to 0.28 m GdnCl. All of the protein samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C before CD measurements took place. For each GdnCl concentration, 10 spectra between 190 and 250 nm (bandwidth, 2 nm) were recorded at a scan rate of 50 nm min–1 and the average of the molar ellipticity at 222 nm was plotted against its corresponding GdnCl concentration. Effects of GrpE on DnaK-Peptide Substrate Complexes at Steady-state Conditions—To investigate the influence of GrpE on the stability of DnaK-substrate complexes, we titrated GrpE to a preformed complex of DnaK·ADP with a peptide, which was labeled at a C-terminal cysteine with 2-(4-(iodoacetamido)anilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (σ32-Q132-Q144-CAANS), and measured the fluorescence at steady-state conditions after equilibration of the reaction. As shown in Fig. 1A, the fluorescence of the peptide decreases with increasing concentrations of GrpE. This phenomenon could have two explanations. Firstly, GrpE could quench the fluorescent dye, or secondly, GrpE could destabilize the DnaK-substrate complex. To test the first possibility, we repeated the experiment with a radiolabeled peptide ([3H]VSV-GC) and separated DnaK-bound and non-bound peptides afterward by size-exclusion chromatography. This experiment clearly showed that the amount of DnaK-peptide complex decreases with increasing GrpE concentrations (Fig. 1B). GrpE Has No Effect on the Dissociation of DnaK-Peptide Substrate Complexes in the Absence of ATP—The GrpE-induced decrease in the equilibrium concentration of the DnaK-substrate complex could result either from an increase in the complex dissociation rate as claimed (13Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or a decrease in the association rate. We therefore determined the dissociation rate constants of the complex of DnaK with σ32-Q132-Q144-CAANS in the absence and presence of GrpE wild type protein and the ΔNGrpE variant and nucleotides. Surprisingly, neither GrpE nor ΔNGrpE did accelerate the substrate dissociation rate in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP, which had been purified from contaminating ATP by high pressure liquid chromatography (Fig. 2, A and B). Only when the DnaK·ADP-substrate complex was mixed with GrpE + ATP + quench peptide, a significant acceleration of the substrate release was measured (Fig. 2A). Identical results were obtained when we used a peptide that was labeled at its N terminus with a dansyl moiety (D-NR) or the radiolabeled peptide [3H]VSV-GC (data not shown). To directly demonstrate the stability of the ternary complex of a GrpE dimer (GrpE2) with DnaK and a peptide, we performed size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR column, which is able to separate DnaK-peptide and GrpE2·DnaK-peptide complexes (Fig. 2C). When GrpE was added to a preformed complex of DnaK with [3H]VSV-GC and then after a 1-min incubation at 30 °C analyzed by gel filtration, comparable amounts of [3H]VSV-GC were found in the ternary complex in the presence of GrpE as in the binary DnaK-peptide complex in the absence of GrpE. When GrpE was present during the incubation of the peptide with DnaK, only minor amounts of radioactivity eluted at the elution volumes of the binary and ternary complexes. GrpE but Not ΔNGrpE Prevents the Association of Peptide Substrates with DnaK—In contrast, the association of the fluorescent σ32-Q132-Q144-C-AANS peptide with DnaK was influenced significantly by the presence of GrpE but not by the presence of ΔNGrpE. As shown in Fig. 3, the absolute amount of fluorescence that was reached in the plateau phase of the association reaction was decreased with increasing GrpE concentrations. At a 0.5:1 molar ratio of GrpE2 to DnaK, the plateau of fluorescence was ∼50% of the value in the absence of GrpE, and at a 1:1 ratio of GrpE2 to DnaK, almost no fluorescence increase was measured. Interestingly, the association rates were not affected by the presence of GrpE (Table I). Similar experiments were repeated with radiolabeled peptides with identical results (not shown). This indicates that GrpE bound to DnaK prevents the association of peptide substrate. It explains why increasing concentration of GrpE led to a decrease in the absolute amount of fluorescence and radioactivity, respectively, observed at equilibrium (see Fig. 1). Together with the gel filtration experiments, these results demonstrate that GrpE significantly slows down peptide association to DnaK and that a ternary GrpE2·DnaK-peptide complex only forms when peptide binds first to DnaK.Table IThe rate of DnaK-peptide association is independent of GrpEDnaK:GrpE2kobs,1kobs,1A1A210-4 s-1%DnaK + F-Pep70 ± 1210 ± 130 ± 470 ± 4DnaK·GrpE2 + F-Pep1:0.556 ± 1711 ± 450 ± 1250 ± 12DnaK·GrpE2 + F-Pep1:1100 ± 248 ± 442 ± 2858 ± 28DnaK·GrpE2 + F-Pep1:248 ± 1234 ± 1624 ± 2476 ± 24DnaK + F-Pep115 ± 169 ± 227 ± 273 ± 2DnaK + GrpE2/F-Pep1:0.564 ± 611 ± 135 ± 465 ± 4DnaK + GrpE2/F-Pep1:179 ± 8asingle exponential fit.DnaK + GrpE2/F-Pep1:270 ± 5asingle exponential fit.DnaK + F-Pep62 ± 115 ± 158 ± 242 ± 2DnaK·ΔNGrpE2 + F-Pep1:0.571 ± 320 ± 144 ± 256 ± 2DnaK·ΔNGrpE2 + F-Pep1:1105 ± 224 ± 132 ± 168 ± 1DnaK·ΔNGrpE2 + F-Pep1:260 ± 0.312 ± 165 ± 135 ± 1a single exponential fit. Open table in a new tab Effects of GrpE on the Interaction of DnaK with Protein Substrates—Our data suggest that in the DnaK·GrpE2 complex, the N termini of the GrpE dimer are located in close vicinity to the DnaK substrate-binding cavity. Because the N-terminal 33 amino acids of GrpE are considered to be unstructured, they may in fact bind like a peptide into the substrate-binding cavity of DnaK. If GrpE binds into the substrate-binding pocket, it may inhibit the association of protein substrates to DnaK as well. To test this hypothesis, we incubated radiolabeled E. coli heat shock transcription factor σ32 with DnaK in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of GrpE2 and analyzed the formed complexes by size-exclusion chromatography. In the absence of GrpE, two peaks of radioactivity were observed, one at the position of free σ32 and one at the position of the σ32·DnaK complex. In the presence of increasing concentrations of GrpE, the peak at the elution volume of the σ32·DnaK complex decreased and an additional peak at lower elution volume appeared (Fig. 4A). This peak corresponds to the ternary complex of a GrpE dimer with DnaK and σ32. The peak representing free σ32 eluted at exactly the same position in the presence and absence of GrpE. Integration of the radioactivity in all of the peaks showed that the total amount of bound σ32 (DnaK·σ32 and GrpE2·DnaK·σ32 complex) decreased albeit not as dramatically as in the case of the peptides (compare Figs. 1B and 4B). We concluded from these results that the affinity of DnaK for σ32 is reduced as well in the presence of GrpE, although not to the same extent as found for peptide substrates. To investigate this theory in more detail, we determined the dissociation rate of the DnaK·σ32 complex in the absence and presence of GrpE. As shown in Fig. 5A, the reduction in affinity of DnaK for σ32 in the presence of GrpE is not the result of an increase in the dissociation rate. On the contrary, GrpE caused a decrease in the dissociation rate of σ32, yielding a half-life of 58 versus 25 min. This increase in half-life was observed independently of the time point when GrpE was added whether it took place at the beginning of the preincubation period together with the labeled [3H]σ32 or at time point 0 together with the unlabeled σ32. The only difference observed was that the starting amount of bound σ32 was lower when GrpE was added at the beginning of the preincubation, consistent with the previous titration experiment. When ATP was added together with the unlabeled quench σ32, no σ32 or very little bound σ32 could be detected independent of whether GrpE was present or absent (Fig. 5B). Substrate Binding to DnaK Does Not Affect the Activity of GrpE as Nucleotide Exchange Factor—Together with the results of the ΔNGrpE variant, these data suggest that the N terminus of GrpE is in close vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket. Therefore, we hypothesized that GrpE would be able to monitor the loading status of the substrate-binding domain and that bound substrate could in this way have an influence on the nucleotide exchange activity of GrpE. To test this hypothesis, we determined the GrpE- or ΔNGrpE-accelerated nucleotide exchange rates in the absence and presence of a peptide or protein substrate. For this purpose, we preincubated DnaK with the fluorescently labeled ADP analogue N8-(4-N′-methylanthraniloyl)adenosine-5′-diphosphate-ADP (29Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of the peptide substrate σ32-Q132-Q144-C or the protein substrate σ32 for 2 h and then rapidly mixed these complexes in a stopped-flow instrument with unlabeled ATP. No significant differences in the nucleotide exchange rates were observed (data not shown), clearly indicating that the loading status of the substrate-binding domain does not influence the nucleotide exchange function of GrpE. The close vicinity of the N terminus of GrpE and the substrate that is bound in the substrate-binding domain of DnaK could have an influence on the chaperone function of DnaK. Therefore, we determined the efficiency of DnaK and DnaJ in refolding the thermally denatured firefly luciferase in the presence of GrpE or ΔNGrpE. Luciferase was denatured for 30 min at 42 °C in the presence of DnaK, DnaJ, and either GrpE or ΔNGrpE and subsequently shifted to 30 °C. The loss of activity during denaturation and the regain of activity due to refolding at 30 °C were monitored. No significant differences between GrpE and ΔNGrpE could be detected (Fig. 6). Expression of grpE-(34–197) Complements the ΔgrpE Temperature Sensitivity Phenotype—To test the functional importance of the N-terminal 33 amino acids in vivo, we tried to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a ΔgrpE strain by ectopically expressing wild type GrpE or ΔNgrpE-encoding genes from an IPTG-inducible promoter (Table II). At 30 °C, the ΔgrpE strains containing the vector alone or the plasmid encoding ΔNGrpE grew well at all of the IPTG concentrations. In contrast, the strain containing the wild type GrpE-encoding gene did not grow at IPTG concentrations of 100 μm and above. At 42 °C, the ΔgrpE strain containing the vector alone did not grow. The strain containing the wild type GrpE-encoding gene grew in the absence of IPTG and not at concentrations of IPTG of 100 μm or above. The strain containing the ΔNgrpE-encoding gene only grew in the presence of 100 μm or more IPTG. To better understand these results, we determined the in vivo concentrations of GrpE and ΔNGrpE in the ΔgrpE strain at the different IPTG concentrations through quantitative Western blotting using GrpE-specific antiserum. We found that GrpE was present even in the absence of IPTG, probably because of contaminations of the media with lactose as previously observed in our laboratory on several occasions. At 100 μm IPTG and above, the GrpE concentrations were increased dramatically by >1000-fold over the GrpE level of the wild type strains. This strong overproduction of GrpE explains the lethal phenotype because an excess of GrpE is detrimental to the chaperone function of the DnaK system (34Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, the level of ΔNGrpE at 500 μm IPTG was even still lower than the level of wild type GrpE in the absence of IPTG. Therefore, the reason for the difference in their ability to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the ΔgrpE strain was attributed to the difference of the amount of produced protein and not due to the differences in their biochemical properties.Table IIComplementation of the temperature sensitivity of a ΔgrpE strainIPTG30 °C42 °C0 μm100 μm250 μm500 μm0 μm100 μm250 μm500 μmVector++++----grpE+---+---ΔNgrpE++++-+++ Open table in a new tab GrpE Folding Is Positively Influenced by Its N-terminal 34 Residues—Because both grpE variants were expressed from the same promoters in identical plasmids and RNA-secondary structure prediction programs did not predict any significant differences in the secondary structure, we hypothesized that the N terminus of GrpE may influence the folding and/or stability of GrpE. To test this hypothesis, we performed thermal and chemical denaturation and renaturation experiments monitoring the folded state of GrpE by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Both methods yielded identical results. The denaturation kinetics of GrpE and ΔNGrpE did not exhibit any significant differences. The renaturation kinetics, however, showed clear differences. Whereas full-length GrpE renatured efficiently under the conditions tested, ΔNGrpE renatured much more inefficiently and only a fraction of the original circular dichroism and fluorescence signal could be regained (Fig. 7 and data not shown). Our findings that GrpE and not ΔNGrpE prevents the association of peptides to DnaK while it is capable of binding to a DnaK·peptide complex to form a ternary complex could be explained in two ways. First, the N terminus of GrpE interacts with the substrate-binding domain in a way that the opening of the substrate-binding pocket is prevented. Second, the 33 N-terminal residues are either located in close proximity or directly interact with the substrate-binding pocket. The first hypothesis is unlikely because GrpE had no influence on the dissociation of prebound peptides, which would be expected if GrpE would hamper the substrate-binding domain in its opening movement. The second hypothesis is supported by the fact that the N terminus of GrpE is unstructured and thereby could mimic an unfolded protein. The published algorithm for the identification of DnaK-binding sites does not identify a high affinity-binding site within the N-terminal region of GrpE, in particular, because this region of the protein is rich in negatively charged residues (37Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). However, a high affinity-binding site might not be necessary because GrpE binds with a Kd of 35 nm to the ATPase domain, and when the N terminus comes in close vicinity of the substrate-binding pocket, even a low affinity-binding site may enter the substrate-binding pocket because of the local high effective concentration of this peptide stretch. Consistent with this hypothesis are the results of a recent publication by Witt and co-workers (38Chesnokova L.S. Slepenkov S.V. Protasevich I.I. Sehorn M.G. Brouillette C.G. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9028-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in which they demonstrate that GrpE but not ΔNGrpE interacts with low affinity with a substrate-binding domain fragment of DnaK (DnaK-(393–507); Kd = 67 μm). This interaction with the substrate-binding domain, however, does not contribute significantly to the overall affinity of the GrpE-DnaK interaction because ΔNGrpE binds with similar affinity to DnaK as wild type GrpE and deletion of an exposed loop in the ATPase domain strongly affects the binding of GrpE to DnaK (25Buchberger A. Schröder H. Büttner M. Valencia A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Chesnokova L.S. Slepenkov S.V. Protasevich I.I. Sehorn M.G. Brouillette C.G. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9028-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whether other nucleotide exchange factors of Hsp70s also interact with the substrate-binding domain of their respective partner protein has not been investigated so far. We and others (35Mayer M.P. Laufen T. Paal K. McCarty J.S. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30534-30539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) show that DnaJ also interacts with the substrate-binding pocket of DnaK, thereby competing with substrates, whereas the main ATPase-stimulating interaction occurs in the ATPase domain (41Gässler C.S.

It is intriguing that both co-chaperones that regulate the ATPase cycle of DnaK also interact with the substrate-binding domain. Because ATP binding and hydrolysis induces conformational changes not only in the ATPase domain of DnaK but also in the substrate-binding domain, an interaction of both regulatory cofactors with both domains of DnaK may contribute to the coordination of these conformational changes. Vice versa, the conformational change of the substrate-binding domain of DnaK upon association of ATP to its ATPase domain may contribute to the rapid release of GrpE. This might be important given the fact that GrpE binds with high affinity to the ATPase domain and, in the ADP state, has a very low dissociation rate (38Chesnokova L.S. Slepenkov S.V. Protasevich I.I. Sehorn M.G. Brouillette C.G. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9028-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The dissociation rate of GrpE from DnaK upon the addition of ATP has not yet been determined. A second intriguing finding of our study was that the dissociation rate of the complex of DnaK with a protein substrate was (approximately 2-fold) slowed down significantly in the presence of GrpE. This means that, under the conditions of high ATP concentrations, the release of the substrate and the release of GrpE are practically always coordinated. Under stress and starvation conditions when the ATP concentration might drop significantly, substrate dissociation is slowed down further through the action of GrpE. Because under these conditions the ATP driven chaperone cycle is not functioning, the release of a misfolded protein substrate would lead to its aggregation with high probability. Similarly, it was shown recently that substrate release from DnaK at a high temperature above 45 °C, when chances for refolding to the native state are also low, is slowed down because of a reversible thermal transition of GrpE, which thereby loses the ability to trigger nucleotide exchange (16Grimshaw J.P.

Biol. 2001; 314: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our findings that the N-terminal 33 amino acids are important for the folding of GrpE are consistent with these studies. Dimerization, which is essential for the nucleotide exchange function of GrpE, may start with an interaction of the N-terminal 33 amino acid of both monomers with each other and then proceed through the long α-helices in a zipper-like fashion. Two recent independent studies claim that GrpE accelerates substrate binding to and the release from DnaK independent of its nucleotide exchange function (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our findings are in contrast to these results. We first suspected that our GrpE preparation might have experienced a partial loss of function. Therefore, we carefully tested the functionality of our protein preparations. First, the structural integrity was studied using circular dichroism spectroscopy including the monitoring of thermal and chemical denaturation curves. Second, the nucleotide exchange activity was determined in direct measurements of the ADP and ATP dissociation rates with increasing GrpE concentrations as described earlier (34Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) or indirectly by determining the steady-state ATPase rates of DnaK in the presence of DnaJ and GrpE. Third, the functionality of GrpE also was shown in chaperone assays by preventing the aggregation and refolding thermally and chemically denatured luciferase. Finally, for our study, we used at least four independent protein preparations. We purified GrpE from ΔdnaK strains to avoid contaminations with DnaK, but we also purified it from a wild type strain in case that DnaK might be important for the folding of GrpE. DnaK was in this case removed by extensive washing with an ATP-containing buffer. To make sure that this GrpE preparation is not contaminated with ATP, we monitored any residual ATP by the very sensitive luciferase assay and found that the contamination is lower than 0.1% of the GrpE concentration. One GrpE preparation was purified in a different laboratory (a kind gift of H.-J. Schönfeld), which also supplied the GrpE that was used in one of the above mentioned studies (15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We could not find any indication that our GrpE preparations are defective and therefore concluded that there must be a different reason for this discrepancy. The two publications (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reporting the substrate release function of GrpE are not completely concordant. Whereas Mally and Witt (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) show that GrpE stimulated peptide release in the absence of nucleotide as well as in the presence of ADP, Han and Christen (15Han W. Christen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) could only find the GrpE stimulation of substrate release in the presence of ADP. Because DnaK has a much higher affinity for ATP (KD = 1 nm) than for ADP (KD = 25 nm) (29Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 46Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), small contaminations of the ADP solutions with ATP could explain the results because GrpE would accelerate ADP release and ATP would preferentially bind to DnaK triggering substrate release. We found that commercially available ADP is contaminated usually with 3–5% ATP and therefore always purify our ADP by high performance liquid chromatography. Such a contamination of ADP with ATP, however, could not explain the results of Mally and Witt (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), showing that GrpE stimulated the substrate release from DnaK in the absence of nucleotide. Mally and Witt (14Mally A. Witt S.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) purified their GrpE by affinity chromatography on immobilized DnaK according to Zylicz et al. (47Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this protocol, GrpE is eluted with a buffer containing 10 mm ATP and dialyzed subsequently. If this final dialyzing step is not carried out extensively as described originally, i.e. with three buffer changes of sufficient volume, significant amounts of ATP can remain in the GrpE preparation, which would then be able to trigger substrate release by DnaK. Based on these considerations and our own data presented here, we must conclude that GrpE does not have the claimed function to trigger substrate release from DnaK even in the absence of nucleotide. Instead, GrpE decelerates the dissociation of protein substrates in the absence of ATP, and it is likely that a coordinated dissociation of GrpE and substrate occurs when ATP binds to the ATPase domain of DnaK. We thank K. Paal for technical assistance and H.-J. Schönfeld for the gift of GrpE."

The structure of the archaeal MCM complex is unclear. The MCM homologues of S. solfataricus (16Carpentieri F. De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The crystal structure of the N-terminal portion of the mtMCM protein suggested a dodecameric structure (19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, electron microscope reconstructions of full-length mtMCM revealed hexameric (20Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or heptameric (21Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) structures, but not larger multimers. The mtMCM, and probably other archaeal MCM enzymes, consists of two main portions. The N-terminal region participates in protein multimerization and ssDNA binding and may also have a regulatory function. The C-terminal portion of the protein contains the helicase catalytic domain(s) (11Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). A high resolution three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal portion revealed a dumbbell-shaped double hexamer. Each monomer folds into three distinct domains (Fig. 1A). Domain A, at the N terminus, is mostly α-helical. Domain B has three β-strands and contains a zinc finger motif. Domain C, positioned between domains A and B (Fig. 1A), contains five β-strands that form an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold. This domain connects the N-terminal portion of the enzyme to the catalytic region. The domain(s) within the N-terminal region responsible for multimerization has not yet been identified. The three-dimensional structure suggested that the zinc finger motif plays a role in double hexamer formation (19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, biochemical analysis of a zinc finger mutant showed that the mutant protein is impaired in ssDNA binding but not double hexamer formation (13Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, studies with the A. fulgidus MCM suggested that domain B, which contains the zinc finger, is not needed for multimerization (18Grainge I. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4888-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but probably for ssDNA binding. A study was therefore initiated to determine the functional roles of each of the three N-terminal domains in the mtMCM protein. In this study it is shown that domain A does not play an essential role in MCM function, because helicase, ATPase, and ssDNA binding activities could be observed in mutant proteins in which the domain had been removed. However, the domain is needed for dsDNA translocation and may play a regulatory role. Domain B is the major contact with ssDNA, and domain C is necessary and sufficient for MCM multimerization and is essential for helicase activity. ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, ssΦX174 DNA was obtained from New England Biolabs, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Center for Advanced Research in Biotechnology DNA synthesis facility. The various MCM proteins were purified as previously described (10Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Generation of MCM Mutants—MCM mutants were generated using a PCR-based approach from plasmid containing the gene encoding the wild-type mtMCM enzyme (12Shechter D.F. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal portion of the molecule (19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) served as the guide for construction of the various mutant proteins. The oligonucleotides and templates used are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. To generate a mutant protein in which the N- or C-terminal portion was deleted (N-ter, Hel, ΔA, ΔAB, AB, AC, BC, A, B, and C), a simple PCR reaction was used. For generating the mutant proteins involving deletions of domains within the polypeptide chain (ΔB, ΔC, ΔBC, ΔAC), a two-step PCR strategy was adopted (schematically described in Supplementary Fig. 1B). The first PCR reaction amplified the smaller fragments of the mutants using their respective forward and reverse primers. The reverse primers designed for these PCRs had a 16–22-bp sequence complementary to the forward primer of the succeeding domain/fragment at the 5′ end. The products of these PCR reactions were then mixed at equimolar concentration, and a second PCR reaction was performed using the forward primer of the upstream fragment (which has a SalI restriction site) and the reverse primer of the downstream fragment (which has an AatII restriction site). This resulted in a product with one or two deleted domains within the wild-type gene that was cloned into pDBLeu and pPC86 vectors (Invitrogen) between the SalI and AatII sites, yielding fusion proteins to the GAL4 DNA binding or activation domains, respectively. These constructs were used in a two-hybrid analysis. To generate the Escherichia coli expression vectors containing the various mtMCM mutants, the pDBLeu vectors with the different truncated proteins were used as templates for PCR with primers containing NdeI (in the forward primer) and XhoI (in the reverse primer) restriction sites (Supplementary Fig. 1). The reverse primer also adds six His residues upstream of the stop codon. The PCR products were cloned into the pET-21a vector (Novagene). All proteins used in the study contain the catalytic domain (except for the N-terminal portion and domain C), and all have a His6 tag at the C terminus. Two-hybrid Analysis—For the two-hybrid analysis, pDBLeu and pPC86 vectors containing the various MCM mutant genes were generated (see above). Plasmids encoding the activation and DNA binding domain fusion proteins were co-transformed into yeast MaV203 cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were plated on complete supplement mixture (CSM) plates without Leu and Trp and grown for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Colonies were streaked on CSM plates without Leu, Trp, and His and containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole to suppress glycerol phosphate dehydratase, an enzyme involved in histidine biosynthesis. Colonies were also streaked on CSM plates without Leu, Trp, and Ura. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Growth on these plates indicates that the proteins fused to the activation and DNA binding domains interact. Gel Filtration Analysis—One hundred fifty micrograms of the various proteins were applied to a superose-6 (HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences) or superdex-200 (HR10/30; Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Columns were run at 22 °C. Fractions (250 μl) were collected and analyzed for the presence of the mtMCM proteins by separation on a 10% SDS-PAGE (except for domain C, which was separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE) and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Glycerol Gradient Sedimentation—Glycerol gradient centrifugation was performed by applying 100 μg of domain C protein to a 5-ml 20–40% glycerol gradient in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm (190,000 × g) for 18 h in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 4 °C, fractions (200 μl) were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of the protein was determined by fractionation on a 12% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Filter Binding Assay—Nitrocellulose filter binding assays were carried out by incubating 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, and 2.7 pmol of proteins (as monomers) at 60 °C for 10 min in 15 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 50 fmol of 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide N120T; 5′-(GTTT)10CGCTGCTCTGCCTCCCGCTGCTCTGCCTCCACTCAGCTCCCTGGCACAGCCTGTCCTGGCACAGGCTGTCCACGTCTGGC-3′ (2500 cpm/fmol). After incubation, the mixture was filtered through an alkaline-washed nitrocellulose filter (HA 0.45 mm; Millipore) (22McEntee K. Weinstock G.M. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which was then washed with 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). The radioactivity adsorbed to the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counter. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Complexes formed between the proteins and ssDNA were detected by a gel mobility shift assay in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 fmol of 32P-labeled N120T oligonucleotide (2500 cpm/fmol), and 1 or 3 pmol of proteins (as monomers). After incubation at 60 °C for 10 min, 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol) was added to stop the reaction. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 200 V through a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 mm magnesium acetate and 5% glycerol in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). ATPase Assay—ATPase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.5 nmol of ATP containing 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and 0.5 or 1.5 pmol of proteins (as monomers) in the presence or absence of 50 ng of ssΦX174 DNA. After incubation at 60 °C for 60 min, an aliquot (1 μl) was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose thin layer plate, and ATP and Pi were separated by chromatography in 1 m formic acid + 0.5 m LiCl. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was quantitated by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. DNA Helicase Assay—The substrate for helicase assays was made as previously described (15Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by annealing a 25-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-GCCATCGGGTGCCTGGCCGCAGCGG-3′, that was prelabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase to a 74-mer oligonucleotide, 5′-GGGACGCGTCGGCCTGGCACGTCGGCCGCTGCGGCCAGGCACCCGATGGC(GTTT)6-3′. The substrate for duplex DNA translocation assays was made as previously described (15Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) by annealing a 49-mer oligonucleotide 5′-(TTTG)6CCGACGTGCCAGGCCGACGCGTCCC-3′ that was prelabeled with [γ-32P]ATP to two other oligonucleotides: a 25-mer 5′-CCGACGTGCCAGGCCGACGCGTCCC-3′ and a 50-mer 5′-GGGACGCGTCGGCCTGGCACGTCGGCCGCTGCGGCCAGGCACCCGATGGC-3′. DNA helicase activity was measured in reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm ATP, 10 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA substrate (3,000 cpm/fmol), and the various MCM mutant proteins as indicated in Fig. 6. After incubation at 60 °C for 1 h, reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of 5× loading buffer (100 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol). Aliquots were loaded onto an 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 200 V. The helicase activity was visualized and quantitated by phosphorimaging. All helicase experiments were repeated three times with almost identical results. Representative gels are shown in Fig. 6. Streptavidin Displacement Assay—The streptavidin displacement assay was performed as previously described (15Shin J.H. Jiang Y. Grabowski B. Hurwitz J. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49053-49062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled 50-mer biotinylated oligonucleotide, 5′-GGGACGCGTCGGCCTGGCACG(Biotin-dT)CGGCCGCTGCGGCCAGGCACCCGATGGC-3′. Ten fmol of the oligonucleotide were incubated with 50 nm streptavidin in a helicase reaction mixture (15 μl) at 30 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of 50 μm free biotin (to trap and sequester streptavidin released during the helicase reaction) and varying amounts of protein. After incubation for 1 h at 60 °C, 5 μl of 5× loading buffer was added to each sample, followed by electrophoretic analysis on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE. The gels were analyzed using phosphorimaging. Multiple Alignment and Surface Conservation—The multiple alignment of the N-terminal portion of the archaeal MCM proteins was constructed by searching the sequence of MCM protein chain A (Protein Data Bank accession number 1ltl) against the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant protein data base using the NCBI Blast PSI-BLAST program. After five rounds of PSI-BLAST, sequence relatives with expectation scores <0.005 from the archaea domain were pooled and aligned using the ClustalW program. The surface conservation shown in Fig. 7 was made by scoring the relative conservation of a given column compared with all other columns in the multiple alignments. The raw score for each column was calculated using standard Shannon's information theory entropy formula (23Schneider T.D. Stephens R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6097-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar) and converted into normalized Z-score distribution by calculating average entropy and S.D. for all columns in the alignment. The molecular surfaces and surface potential were built using the Grasp program. Domain C of the mtMCM N-terminal Region Is Required for Multimer Formation—As a first step in determining the region(s) of the mtMCM needed for multimerization, a two-hybrid analysis was performed. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal portion of the protein participates in hexamer/double hexamer formation (11Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and a high resolution three-dimensional structure of the mtMCM N-terminal portion revealed a three-domain (A, B, and C) structure (Fig. 1A) (19Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Using the three-dimensional structure as a guide, a number of constructs were made to express various deletion mutants of the N-terminal domains. These include the expression of the individual domains and the deletion of single or multiple domains. The genes encoding the deletion proteins were generated using a PCR-based approach (see “Experimental Procedures”) and cloned into the pDBLeu and pPC86 vectors (Invitrogen), resulting in fusion proteins with the GAL4 DNA binding and activation domains, respectively. The various constructs were analyzed for their ability to interact with the full-length protein, the N-terminal portion of the molecule, and for self-interaction (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1B, each protein containing domain C showed interaction with itself, the full-length, and the N-terminal portion of the mtMCM protein. Furthermore, domain C is the only intact domain that demonstrated self-interaction. To confirm the observation made with the two-hybrid analysis, all deletion proteins containing the catalytic domain, the N-terminal region, and domain C alone were expressed and purified from E. coli and analyzed on a superose-6 gel filtration column. As shown in Fig. 2, truncated proteins containing domain C form dodecamers (panels A, B, D, E, and G). All the proteins lacking domain C are monomeric (panels F, H, and I). Several of the mutant proteins that contain domain C, however, are less stable than the full-length protein as is evident from the presence of two peaks (dodecamers and hexamers) or by the “trailing” of the proteins, suggesting that the complex dissociated during fractionation on the sizing column (e.g. panel G). These observations suggest that either additional domains, besides domain C, are involved in double hexamer formation or the deletion of the other domains may affect the overall stability of the mtMCM complex. The data presented in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that domain C is responsible for multimerization of the mtMCM. The superose-6 column, however, is not the most suitable one for the analysis of domain C alone because the domain is only 17.9 kDa in size. Therefore, a superdex-200 column was used to analyze this domain (Fig. 3A). This analysis revealed the presence of a major peak at fractions 58–60. To get a more accurate size determination, a glycerol gradient sedimentation was also performed (Fig. 3B). In the glycerol gradient a major peak was observed at fractions 11 and 12. Combining the S value and Stokes radius in the mass equation (24Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) yields a native mass of 103 kDa for the major peak on gel filtration (Fig. 3A). This is in good agreement with the expected size of a hexameric structure (107.8 kDa). However, a minor peak at fractions 46–48 was also observed following the gel filtration (Fig. 3A). This elution position is consistent with a dodecameric structure (216 kDa). In addition, the glycerol gradient sedimentation shows a trailing of the proteins from the dodecameric to hexameric structures. These results may suggest that although domain C alone can form double hexamers, they are not stable and readily dissociate to hexamers during the gel filtration and glycerol gradient analyses. Domain B of the N-terminal Portion of mtMCM Is Needed for Efficient ssDNA Binding—During DNA unwinding, the helicase translocates along one strand of the duplex and displaces the complementary strand. Hence, all DNA helicases, including mtMCM, have been shown to interact with ssDNA (25Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the zinc finger motif is needed for ssDNA binding by mtMCM (13Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as well as by the eukaryotic helicase (26You Z. Ishimi Y. Masai H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42471-42479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results of these studies, however, suggested that other regions of the proteins are also needed for efficient DNA binding. Thus, the ability of the various mutant proteins to interact with ssDNA was determined using a filter binding assay (Fig. 4A) and gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 4B). As shown in Fig. 4, all truncated proteins show substantially reduced levels of ssDNA binding in comparison to the full-length enzyme. Deletion of domain B has the most severe effect on ssDNA binding, because no ssDNA binding could be detected in a truncated protein in which only domain B was deleted (Fig. 4A, ΔB). This observation suggests that domain B is the major (but probably not the only) region of the mtMCM that contacts ssDNA. The zinc finger motif is located in domain B, and thus these results are consistent with past reports illustrating the need for an intact zinc finger for efficient DNA binding (13Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26You Z. Ishimi Y. Masai H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42471-42479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of domain B in conjunction with another domain (either A or C) resulted in a protein with better ssDNA binding in comparison to a protein in which only domain B was removed. It is possible that removing such a large part of the protein exposed charged regions that may show affinity to the negatively charged DNA. Nevertheless, all these mutant proteins show a substantial reduction in ssDNA binding in comparison to the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, a mutant protein lacking domain C that could not form hexamers (Fig. 2F) retained about 40% of ssDNA binding in comparison to the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4A). These results are consistent with previously reported observations (10Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) that show that monomeric mtMCM protein retains detectable ssDNA binding. This indicates that hexamer/dodecamer formation is not needed for ssDNA binding. The ability of the truncated proteins to interact with ssDNA was also determined using a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 4B). The results are similar to those observed with the filter binding assay. Domain B is most critical for ssDNA binding because proteins lacking the domain (ΔB, ΔBC, and ΔAB) bind poorly to ssDNA (Fig. 4B, lanes 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, and 17) in comparison to the full-length or truncated proteins containing domain B. Proteins deleted for domain C (ΔC, ΔAC) retained ssDNA binding (lanes 10, 11, 14 and 15). Interestingly"

Upon binding of thyroid hormone, the thyroid receptor releases corepressor proteins and undergoes a conformational change that allows for the interaction of coactivating proteins necessary for gene transcription. This interaction is mediated by a conserved motif, termed the NR box, found in many coregulators. Recent work has demonstrated that differentially assembled coregulator complexes can elicit specific biological responses. However, the mechanism for the selective assembly of these coregulator complexes has yet to be elucidated. To further understand the principles underlying thyroid receptor-coregulator selectivity, we designed a high-throughput in vitro binding assay to measure the equilibrium affinity of thyroid receptor to a library of potential coregulators in the presence of different ligands including the endogenous thyroid hormone T3, synthetic thyroid receptor β-selective agonist GC-1, and antagonist NH-3. Using this homogenous method several coregulator NR boxes capable of associating with thyroid receptor at physiologically relevant concentrations were identified including ones found in traditional coactivating proteins such as SRC1, SRC2, TRAP220, TRBP, p300, and ARA70; and those in coregulators known to repress gene activation including RIP140 and DAX-1. In addition, it was discovered that the thyroid receptor-coregulator binding patterns vary with ligand and that this differential binding can be used to predict biological responses.

Utiger R.D. The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. Lippencott, Philadelphia, PA1991Google Scholar, 2Greenspan F.S. The Thyroid Gland, Basic & Clinical Endocrinology. Appleton & Lange, Stamford, CT1997Google Scholar). Most T3 actions are mediated through the thyroid hormone receptors (TR), which regulate transcription of target genes either positively or negatively in response to hormone binding. There are two different genes that express different TR subtypes, TRα and TRβ. Each transcript can be alternatively spliced generating different isoforms (TRα1, TRα2, TRβ1, TRβ2,) (3Lazar M.A. Chin W.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1990; 86: 1777-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Lazar M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 184-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). While most of these isoforms are widely expressed, there are distinct patterns of expression that vary with tissue and developmental stage. In particular, TRβ2 is found almost exclusively in the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and developing ear. In addition, mice deficient in either TRα or TRβ display unique phenotypes, suggesting that the different TR isoforms have unique regulatory roles (5Flamant F. Samarut J. Trends Endocrinol.

Genet. 2001; 27: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The thyroid hormone receptors belong to a superfamily of proteins known as the nuclear hormone receptors (NR). Like other members of the NR superfamily, TR has three functional domains: an N-terminal transactivation domain (NT), a central DNA binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). The DBD of TR recognizes short, repeated sequences of DNA found in T3-responsive genes, termed the thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). TR can bind to a TRE as a monomer, homodimer, or heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (12Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). However, receptor activation from the heterodimer complex is the best characterized to date. Both liganded and unliganded TR bind to TREs. In the absence of T3, TR associates with corepressor proteins at the TRE maintaining the chromatin in a compact state and therefore repressing gene activation. Upon binding of T3, TR undergoes a conformational change releasing corepressor proteins and allowing for the interaction with coactivator proteins that enhance TRE-driven gene transcription. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies have provided a considerable amount of information about NR-coregulator interactions. The best studied coregulators belong to the p160 protein family of steroid receptor coactivators (SRC) (13Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Members of this family include SRC1, SRC2 (GRIP1/TIF2), and SRC3 (AIB1/TRAM1/RAC3/ACTR). These proteins contain several functional domains including the nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID), and two activation domains that interact with other coregulatory proteins CBP/p300 (AD-1) and CARM-1 (AD-2) (Fig. 1A). Within the NID there are three repeated motifs with the consensus sequence LXXLL, often termed the NR box. In addition there is a unique fourth LXXLL motif found in the extreme C terminus of an alternatively spliced variant of SRC1, SRC1-a. Several investigations have shown that the LXXLL motif is necessary and sufficient for interaction with NR (14Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Further structural work with a coregulator NR box peptide and liganded TR has revealed that the LXXLL binds to a hydrophobic groove in the TR-LBD as an α-helix (16Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Other coregulators include CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (17Chrivia J.C.

Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The interaction of these coregulators with nuclear receptors is also mediated by LXXLL motifs. An analogous motif, I/LXXII, has been identified in corepressors such as nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) and silencing mediator of retinoic acid (SMRT), and structural studies have shown that the binding sites for coactivators and corepressors partially overlap (29Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). There is a large pool of coregulators available for interaction with TR. Although there appears to be some functional redundancy within the SRCs, there is also evidence that SRCs have distinct biological regulatory roles. While mice deficient in SRC1 exhibit resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), the phenotypes for mice deficient in SRC2 and SRC3 are distinct with no evidence of RTH (30Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 31Weiss R.E. Xu J. Ning G. Pohlenz J. O'Malley B.W. Refetoff S.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1554-1557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies, along with recent work with the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors, have demonstrated that interaction with specific coregulators can elicit specific biological responses (33Li X. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3763-3773Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how NRs discriminate between different coregulators. In this study we sought to define rules that govern TR-coregulator selectivity. Combinatorial peptide libraries have been used to define NR-coregulator specificity, and have revealed that the sequences immediately flanking the NR box are critical for specificity (34Northrop J.P. Nguyen D. Piplani S. Olivan S.E. Kwan S.T. Go N.F. Hart C.P. Schatz P.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 605-622PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chang C. Norris J.D. Gron H. Paige L.A. Hamilton P.T. Kenan D.J. Fowlkes D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8226-8239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the peptides in these studies were generated from random libraries that do not represent the true NR box sequences. Other investigations focused on defining SRC NR box selectivity using a subset of coregulator NR boxes from the SRCs. This work has shown that ligands can allosterically modulate the coregulator binding pocket and therefore differentially alter specific SRC recruitment and NR box usage (36Bramlett K.S. Wu Y. Burris T.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Geistlinger T.R. McReynold A.C. Guy R.K.

However, to date there has been no comprehensive study of the interactions of TR and natural coregulator NR boxes. To address this issue, we designed an in vitro binding assay to measure the equilibrium binding of TRβ to a library of potential coregulators in a high-throughput manner using fluorescence polarization. With this method, binding constants for TRβ to coregulator NR boxes were determined in a consistent format, including NR boxes from SRCs and nine other known coregulators. In addition the TRβ-coregulator binding patterns for three different ligands including T3, the synthetic TRβ-selective agonist GC-1, and the T3 antagonist NH-3 were defined. This quantitative information can be used to establish rules for TRβ coregulator selectivity, and these rules can be used for predicting biological responses. Ligand Synthesis—GC-1 and NH-3 were synthesized as previously described (39Chiellini G. Apriletti J.W. Yoshihara H.A. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. Scanlan T.S. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 40Nguyen N.H. Apriletti J.W. Cunha Lima S.T. Webb P. Baxter J.D. Scanlan T.S. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—Human TRβ LBD (His6; residues Glu202-Asp461) was expressed from a pET28a construct (Novagen) in BL21(DE3) (20 °C, 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside added at OD600 = 0.6) as previously described (15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 0.025% tween, protease inhibitors, 10 mg of lysozyme, pH 7.5, 30 min on ice), and sonicated for 3 × 3 min on ice. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was loaded onto Talon resin (Clontech). Liganded protein was eluted with 500 mm imidazole plus ligand (3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (Sigma); GC-1; or NH-3). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and HPSEC, and protein concentration measured by the Coomassie protein assay. Peptide Library Synthesis—Coregulator peptides consisting of 20 amino acids with the general motif of CXXXXXXXLXXL/AL/AXXXXXXX were constructed, where C is cysteine, L is leucine, A is alanine, and X is any amino acid. The sequences of all the coregulator peptides were obtained from human isoform candidate genes (SRC1/AAC50305, SRC2/Q15596, SRC3/Q9Y6Q9, PGC-1/AAF19083, TRAP220/Q15648, TRBP/Q14686, TRAP100/Q75448, ARA70/Q13772, ARA55/NP_057011, p300/Q92831, RIP140/P48552, DAX-1/P51843, SHP/Q15466). The peptides were synthesized in parallel using standard fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry in 48 well synthesis blocks (FlexChem System, Robbins) (41Wellings D.A. Atherton E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 289: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Preloaded Wang (Novagen) resin was deprotected with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide. The next amino acid was then coupled using 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (2.38 eq), Fmoc-protected amino acid (2.5 eq), and diisopropylethylamine (5 eq) in anhydrous dimethylformamide. Coupling efficiency was monitored by the Kaiser test. Synthesis then proceeded through a cycle of deprotection and coupling steps until the peptides were completely synthesized. The completed peptides were cleaved from the resin with concomitant side chain deprotection (81% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% thioanisole, 2.5% ethanedithiol, 3% water, 2% dimethylsulfide, 1.5% ammonium iodide), and the crude product was evaporated using a Speedvac (Gene-Vac). Reversed-phase chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/ESI) were used to purify the peptides. The purified peptides were lyophilized. A thiol reactive fluorophore, 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein (Molecular Probes), was then coupled to the N-terminal cysteine following the manufacturer's protocol. Labeled peptide was isolated using reversed-phase chromatography and mass spectrometry. Peptides were quantified using UV spectroscopy. Purity was assessed using LCMS (Supplemental Information). Direct Binding Assay—Using a BiomekFX in the Center for Advanced Technology (CAT), hTRβ-LBD was serially diluted from 70-0.002 μm in binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing 140 μm ligand (T3, GC-1, or NH-3) in 96-well plates. Then 10 μl of diluted protein was added to 10 μl of fluorescent coregulator peptide (20 nm) in 384-well plates yielding final protein concentrations of 35-0.001 μm and 10 nm fluorescent peptide concentration. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Binding was then measured using fluorescence polarization (excitation λ 485 nm, emission λ 530 nm) on an Analyst AD (Molecular Devices). Two independent experiments were assayed for each state in quadruplicate. Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot 8.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Il), and the Kd values were obtained by fitting data to the following equation (y = min + (max - min)/1 + (x/Kd) Hill slope). Coregulator Peptide Library—A library of known coregulator peptides consisting of the LXXLL sequence plus 7-8 additional flanking residues at each terminus was synthesized (Fig. 1B). Previous screens with coactivator peptides established amino acid residues at +6 to +12 as critical for binding (38McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 42Coulthard V.H. Matsuda S. Heery D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10942-10951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To capture these specificity determinants, peptides of 20-amino acid length were generated. Additionally, negative control peptides were made for each coregulator NR box by replacing L+4 and L+5 with alanine (LXXAA), as this substitution has been shown to abolish interactions with NR (38McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A thiol reactive fluorescent probe was covalently attached to each peptide via a cysteine positioned at the N terminus of each peptide. The coregulator peptides are listed in the far left column of Fig. 1B, where SRC1-1, SRC1-2, SRC1-3 represent the first, second, and third NR boxes in SRC1, respectively. This nomenclature, first proposed by O'Malley, is applied to all of the coregulator peptides studied throughout this report (30Xu J. Liao L. Ning G. Yoshida-Komiya H. Deng C. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). All peptide probes were synthesized in parallel using the Fmoc strategy and purified by RP-HPLC. Identity and purity were confirmed using HPLC and MALDI-TOF or LCMS (Supplemental Information). Seven targeted coregulator NR boxes, TRAP100-1, TRAP100-5, RIP140-2, RIP140-4, TRAP220-1(-), TRBP-1(-), and TRAP100-6(-), are omitted as they could not be synthesized or purified after several attempts. Coregulator Peptides Bind to hTRβ-LBD in Four Different Binding Modes—Initial peptide binding studies were carried out with SRC2-2, and the ligand binding domain of the human thyroid hormone receptor β (hTRβ-LBD) in the presence of T3. As shown in Fig. 2A, SRC2-2 binds to TRβ in a saturable dose-dependent manner with a measured Kd of 0.7 μm, consistent with literature reports (0.8 μm) (15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that this interaction was specific by carrying out binding studies with a mutated SRC2-2 peptide (LXXAA, SRC2-2(-)). The trace observed in Fig. 2A reveals that SRC2-2(-) does not interact with TRβ in the presence of T3. To further elucidate the coregulator binding pattern of TRβ in the presence of T3, direct binding assays were carried out with the entire coregulator peptide library. This set of experiments was executed by maintaining a constant concentration of coregulator peptide (10 nm) and varying the TRβ concentration from 0.001-35 μm in the presence of saturating amounts of T3 (90 μm). The results revealed that the 34 different coregulator peptides bound to liganded TR with varying degrees of affinity. Individual Klotz plots were constructed for each coregulator peptide. This analysis revealed four different binding modes. Example equilibrium affinity curves are summarized in Fig. 2 (A-D) and Kd value ranges are reported in Fig. 3A. In no case did the negative peptide controls bind to liganded TRβ. The first binding mode consisted of peptides that bound in a dose dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 2A) where a clear plateau was reached within the protein concentration range studied. Eight coregulator peptides exhibited this mode: SRC2-1, SRC2-2, SRC2-3, TRAP220-1, TRBP-1, p300, RIP140-5, and DAX1-3. The Kd values for this class ranged from 0.7 to 10 μm. The next binding mode included peptides where binding appeared to be reaching saturation but did not have a clear plateau, as defined by at least two points with indistinguishable y-ordinates (Fig. 2B). This assumption is based on previous binding studies conducted with these coregulator peptides where similar changes in polarization values were observed for saturating binding isotherms (data not shown). These peptides bound to TRβ with a Kd range of 10-30 μm and included SRC1-2, SRC1-3, SRC3-2, TRAP220-2, TRBP-2, and ARA70. To accurately obtain Kd values, however, the binding studies would need to be carried out at protein concentrations varying from 1-300 μm as this would give the widest range of polarization values. Working with TRβ protein concentrations higher than 100 μm is problematic due to protein aggregation and decreased protein stability. In order to reflect the inability to obtain an unambiguous Kd value, we report a Kd range,10-30 μm, for coregulator peptides that exhibit this binding mode. The third binding mode is one in which polarization increases with protein concentration but does not seem to be reaching saturation. This mode is exemplified by SRC3-3 (Fig. 2C) where the polarization of SRC3-3 slowly increases with TRβ concentration. Other coregulators included in this category are SRC1-1, SRC3-1, SRC3-3, RIP140-3, RIP140-8, and SHP. The binding isotherms for this group suggest that the coregulator peptides are binding non-specifically or that they bind with a Kd value significantly above the working assay range, (e.g. >30 μm). This class of coregulator peptides is distinguished from the final group of peptides where no binding is observed (Fig. 2D). T3 Recruitment of Coregulators—We report here the first comprehensive investigation of coregulator recruitment to liganded TRβ with 12 different coregulators and 32 unique NR boxes as well as appropriate negative controls (LXXAA). Of the 32 coregulator peptides tested, 20 appear to interact with TRβ in the presence of T3 with varying degrees of affinity. The strongest recruitment observed was with SRC2-2 which exhibited a Kd of 0.7 μm ± 0.2. This was followed by TRBP-1 (Kd = 1.8 μm ± 0.1), RIP140-5 (Kd = 2.5 μm ± 0.4), TRAP220-1 (Kd = 2.7 μm ±1.1), DAX1-3 (Kd = 3.6 μm ± 2.3), SRC2-3 (Kd = 4.5 μm ± 1.5), SRC2-1 (Kd = 6.0 μm ± 2.0), and p300 (Kd = 9.2 μm ± 2.8). The coregulator peptides that clearly did not interact with T3 liganded TRβ included ARA55, all of the TRAP100 peptides, and some of the RIP140 and DAX1 NR box peptides. The remaining coregulator peptides bound to TRβ weakly with Kd values ranging from 10 to 30 μm or > 30 μm as discussed above. The SRCs are a family of coregulators whose interaction with TRβ have been extensively studied using non-quantitative methods (15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J.

Our data are consistent with previously published work where it was determined that TRβ has a strong preference for SRC2 NR box peptides with the overall observed preference being SRC2-2 > SRC2-3 > SRC2-1 (15Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The next family member, SRC1, bound to liganded TRβ to a lesser extent with SRC1-2 ∼ SRC1-3 > SRC1-1. Only weak interactions were observed for SRC3 where affinity has been reported as SRC3-2 > SRC3-1 = SRC3-3. The TRAP coactivator complex has been shown to associate with NRs and help initiate transcription (19Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol.

TRAP220 has two NR boxes and in this report it was determined that the first NR box, TRAP220-1, interacted more strongly than the second NR box, TRAP220-2. This is the opposite of what has been reported for TRα, supporting the notion that TR isoforms can differentially recruit coactivator NR boxes (20Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G.

As previously reported, none of these NR boxes interact with liganded TRβ (19Zhang J. Fondell J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1130-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another coregulator that has been shown to interact with TRβ is TRBP. This coactivator is ubiquitously expressed and appears to be a general coactivator that can associate with NR including TR, ER, PPAR, as well as other transcriptional proteins"

The data in the present study document that transcription from the human C/EBPβ gene is induced in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, such as glucose deprivation, or treatment of cells with tunicamycin or thapsigargin. Transient transfection of C/EBPβ genomic fragments linked to a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that the C/EBPβ promoter plays no major regulatory role. Instead, by deletion analysis it was discovered that a 46-bp region, located at a genomic site that corresponds to the 3′-untranslated region of the C/EBPβ mRNA, harbored an element that was required for the stress response. Mutagenesis demonstrated that a cis-regulatory element located at nt +1614–1621 (5′-TGACGCAA-3′) is responsible for activation of the C/EBPβ gene. Electrophoresis mobility shift analysis revealed that proteins are bound to this element and that the amount of binding is increased following glucose deprivation.

Although C/EBPβ plays a role in a wide range of important cellular processes, such as adipocyte differentiation, carbohydrate metabolism, inflammation, and cellular proliferation, investigation of the transcriptional control of the C/EBPβ gene itself is limited. It has been reported that the cAMP-response element-like sequences, located within the rat C/EBPβ proximal promoter, are required for C/EBPβ expression and IL-6-mediated induction of the gene during the acute phase response (5Niehof M.

Nature. 2002; 415: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2161) Google Scholar). However, at least two ER stress-responsive pathways exist in mammals, and proteolytic activation of the transcription factor ATF6 also plays an important role (14Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 15Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell.

The precursor form of ATF6 is an ER transmembrane protein that is proteolytically cleaved in response to ER stress, and the N-terminal portion is thereby released as an active transcription factor, which translocates to the nucleus. A bipartite mammalian ER stress response element (ERSE), 5′-CCAATN9CCACG-3′, was identified (17Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol.

However, more recently it has been demonstrated that XBP-1 activates a second set of ER stress-responsive genes by binding to a genomic element composed of the consensus sequence 5′-TGACGTG(G/A)-3′ (12Lee K.

Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3014) Google Scholar). Asparagine synthetase (ASNS), which catalyzes asparagine biosynthesis, is transcriptionally regulated in response to a variety of cellular stress signals, including either amino acid limitation or ER stress (20Guerrini L. Gong S.S. Mangasarian K. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3202-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 21Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J.

A cis-element, termed nutrient-sensing response element-1, located within the ASNS proximal promoter at nt –68 to –60 contributes to this induction under the stress conditions mentioned above, and binding of C/EBPβ to the NSRE-1 is increased following activation of these stress pathways. Marten et al. (23Marten N.W. Burke E.J. Hayden J.M. Straus D.S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was the first to document that the mRNA content of C/EBPβ is increased by amino acid deprivation, but regulation of the C/EBPβ gene by ER stress has yet to be examined. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that transcription from the human C/EBPβ gene is induced in response to ER stress and to examine the mechanism of this induction. C/EBPβ mRNA content was increased following ER stress conditions including glucose deprivation, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin treatment. Given that ER stress did not alter the turnover rate of the C/EBPβ mRNA, it was proposed that this increase was due to increased transcription. Transient transfection of genomic fragments linked to a luciferase reporter gene demonstrated that a 46-bp region, located at a genomic site that corresponds to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the C/EBPβ mRNA is required for the induction following ERSR activation, and that the C/EBPβ promoter plays no major regulatory role. Mutagenesis further indicated that a cis-regulatory element located at nt +1614–1621 (5′-TGACGCAA-3′) is responsible for activation of the C/EBPβ gene by ER stress. This element differs from the consensus mUPRE (see above) by 2 nucleotides (19Wang Y. Shen J. Arenzana N. Tirasophon W. Kaufman R.J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27013-27020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but expression of exogenous XPBP1 activated transcription from a C/EBPβ genomic fragment containing this sequence. Cell Culture—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM), pH 7.4, (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA), supplemented to contain 25 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm glutamine, 1× nonessential amino acids, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 μg/ml penicillin G, 28.4 μg/ml gentamycin, 0.023 μg/ml N-butyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Wild type and XBP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, generously supplied by Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher (Harvard School of Public Health) were maintained as described previously (24Lee A.H. Iwakoshi N.N. Glimcher L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7448-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—HepG2 cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and then incubated for the indicated time in complete MEM, glucose-free MEM, complete MEM containing either 300 nm thapsigargin (Tg) or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin. Total cellular RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). 32P-Radiolabeled cDNA probe synthesis and Northern analysis was performed as described by Aslanian et al. (25Aslanian A.M. Fletcher B.S. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe for C/EBPβ was nt +1425–1632, which corresponds to a fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of the human C/EBPβ mRNA. The cDNA probe for human C/EBPα was the entire 3′-untranslated region of the human C/EBPα mRNA. The ribosomal protein L7a cDNA probe was the entire coding sequence obtained from Dr. Tatsuo Tanaka (University of Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan), and the cDNA probe for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was the entire coding sequence obtained from Dr. Anupam Agarwal (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—25–200 ng of HepG2 total RNA was used in each reaction to measure the mRNA content for C/EBPβ, Asns, and GAPDH. SYBR green chemistry was used to detect the products of interest (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA). The primers for amplification were as follows: C/EBPβ, 5′-AGAACGAGCGGCTGCAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-CAAGTTCCGCAGGGTGCTGA-3′; ASNS, 5′-GCAGCTGAAAGAAGCCCAAGT-3′ and 5′-TGTCTTCCATGCCAATTGCA-3′; GAPDH, 5′-TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC-3′ and 5′-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3′. The RT-PCRs were performed and quantified using a DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (MJ Research, Reno, NV). Each RNA sample was measured in duplicate, and three independent RNA samples were collected for each time point. Subcloning of the Human C/EBPβ Gene—A BAC clone (RP11-112L6) containing the human DNA sequence from chromosome 20 was obtained from the Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK). To obtain a C/EBPβ-containing genomic fragment, the BAC clone was digested with EcoRI and PvuI, and fragments were separated by preparative field inversion gel electrophoresis and then ligated into the EcoRI site of the pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Using the C/EBPβ cDNA probe described above, colony hybridization was used to screen the resulting DH5α colonies, and an 11.5-kb C/EBPβ clone was obtained that contained nt –8451 to +3074. Deletion Analysis—C/EBPβ fragments containing nt –8451/+157 and –1595/+157 were obtained by restriction digestion of the –8451/+3074 clone, whereas the C/EBPβ promoter fragment (nt –325/+157) was prepared by PCR. The C/EBPβ sequences +1554/+1646, +1423/+2213, and +1423/+3541, which are 3′ to the coding sequence, were amplified by PCR using either nt –8451/+3074 or the original BAC clone as template. The promoter fragments were ligated into the SmaI site of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which contains the Firefly luciferase gene as a reporter, whereas the C/EBPβ gene downstream sequences were ligated into the BamHI site. To test the C/EBPβ genomic sequences +1554/+1600 and +1601/+1646 with the SV40 promoter, oligonucleotides were synthesized with BamHI linkers (Invitrogen) and ligated into the BamHI site of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis—All site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. For mutagenesis, substitutions were made within the C/EBPβ +1423 to +2213 or the +1601/+1646 sequence, cloned into BamHI site of the firefly luciferase reporter gene, and expressed under the control of either the C/EBPβ promoter –1593/+157 or the SV40 promoter. The specific mutations made are given under “Results.” The C/EBPβ-luciferase constructs were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and the firefly luciferase activity was measured as described below. Transient Transfection and Transcription Factor Overexpression— For each transfection, 1 μg of the pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter construct, driven by either the human GRP78 promoter –132/+7 (a generous gift from Dr. Kazutoshi Mori, Kyoto, Japan) or by the C/EBPβ sequence +1601/+1646 under the control of the SV40 promoter, was co-transfected along with 0.5 ng of a reference Renilla luciferase expression plasmid, phRL-SV40 (Promega). When indicated, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1 vector only (Invitrogen) or pcDNA3.1 containing the cDNA sequence for the active and nuclear form of ATF6α (amino acids 1–373) or the spliced and active form of XBP-1 (both gifts from Dr. Kazutoshi Mori, Kyoto, Japan) was included. HepG2 cells were transfected at ∼50% confluence in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) using the SuperFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). After transfection and a subsequent 18-h recovery in complete MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, cells were then incubated for 12 h in either fresh complete MEM or MEM plus 300 nm Tg, each supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The effect of transcription factor overexpression was measured by luciferase activity. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were transfected with the C/EBPβ-firefly luciferase reporter plasmids described above. The relative transfection efficiency was corrected by co-transfection with Renilla luciferase reporter (phRL-SV40) driven by the SV40 promoter. The firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed by the dual luciferase reporter system according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). The cells were transfected at ∼50% confluence in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) using the SuperFect transfection reagent, as described above. The data are expressed as the averages ± S.D. of 3–4 assays, and each experiment was repeated with multiple batches of cells. Immunoblotting—Total cell extracts (30–60 μg/sample) were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), as previously described (26Pan Y.-X. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with Fast Green Stain to check for equal loading between lanes. Primary antibodies (1:100 to 1:1000 dilution) were rabbit polyclonals against either C/EBPβ (catalog no. sc-150) or XBP-1 (catalog no. sc-7160) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG and was used at a dilution of 1:2000 (XBP-1) or 1:20,000 (C/EBPβ). The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HepG2 cells were seeded on 150-mm dishes (15 × 106 cells/dish). After 16 h of culture, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 18 h in either complete MEM or MEM lacking glucose, both supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The nuclear extraction was performed as previously described (27Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry assay (28Kilberg M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 564-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Singlestranded oligonucleotides were annealed by adding 4.8 nmol of each oligonucleotide, with 20 μl of 10× annealing buffer (100 nm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m sodium chloride, 10 mm EDTA) in a total volume of 200 μl. The oligonucleotide solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and then allowed to gradually cool to 4 °C over 2 h. The oligonucleotides used either as electrophoretic mobility shift assay probes or competitors are listed in Fig. 10. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by extension of overlapping ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. For each binding reaction, 10 μg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with 40 mm Tris-base, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.05 mm EDTA for 20 min on ice. The radiolabeled probe was added at a concentration of 0.004 pmol/reaction (∼20,000 cpm), and where indicated, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added at 0.04 pmol/reaction. The reaction mixture (30-μl final volume), was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The reactions were subjected to electrophoresis as described previously (27Leung-Pineda V. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16585-16591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Fig. 10Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of the human C/EBPβ mUPRE sequence. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HepG2 cells maintained in either complete (MEM) or glucose-deficient (MEM-Glc) MEM medium for 18 h, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The sequence of the 32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes (WT or Mut) and competitor oligonucleotides (WT, Mut, or NS) are shown in the lower panel and correspond to the wild type C/EBPβ sequence or one that has the mUPRE core sequence mutated as shown (Mut). Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were prepared corresponding to the wild type C/EBPβ sequence (WT), the C/EBPβ sequence with the mUPRE core mutated (Mut), or an unrelated, nonspecific sequence (NS). The competitor oligonucleotides were added at 100 times the concentration of the labeled probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Induction of C/EBPβ mRNA by Glucose Deprivation—To examine whether or not C/EBPα or C/EBPβ mRNA content was altered in response to glucose deprivation of HepG2 cells, the cells were incubated in glucose-free MEM for 0–12 h, and Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig. 1A). An initial increase in C/EBPβ mRNA content was observed between 2 and 4 h of glucose deprivation and then reached a maximum of about 7 times the control value (5.5 mm glucose) at 8 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, C/EBPα mRNA content remained relatively steady for 4 h and then declined during the 8–12-h period of glucose deprivation (Fig. 1C). To obtain a quantitative analysis of C/EBPβ regulation by glucose, the mRNA level for C/EBPβ was measured for three independent experiments by real time quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). The induction of C/EBPβ mRNA measured by Northern blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR followed a similar pattern, reaching a comparable degree of induction at 8 h. Induction of C/EBPβ mRNA and Protein by ER Stress—To further investigate whether or not the ERSR pathway was responsible for the increased C/EBPβ mRNA content, HepG2 cells were incubated with known ERSR activators such as thapsigargin (Tg), an ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, or tunicamycin, an inhibitor of protein glycosylation (29Pahl H.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 683-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Consistent with their common mode of action, tunicamycin treatment and glucose deprivation increased C/EBPβ mRNA content over a similar time frame, with the initial increase being observed between 2 and 4 h, and reaching a 7- or 8-fold induction at 8 h (Fig. 2). In contrast, thapsigargin treatment also induced C/EBPβ mRNA content, but the maximal induction of 8-fold was achieved by 4 h. To test whether or not C/EBPβ protein content was also increased, immunoblots of control (MEM-incubated cells) or Tg-treated whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting (Fig. 3). ER stress caused an elevation of full-length (liverenriched activating protein) C/EBPβ protein that was consistent with the rise in mRNA level, although the absolute magnitude of the protein increase was less than that for the mRNA. The peak of C/EBPβ protein occurred at 4 h and stayed relatively high for the remainder of the 12-h period investigated. To show equal lane loading, the blot was stained with Fast Green, and as a negative control, the blot was probed with antibody specific for the bZIP transcription factor ATF2, which did not show increased expression (Fig. 3, upper panel). Induction of C/EBPβ mRNA by the ERSR Is Dependent on de Novo Protein Synthesis—To determine whether or not synthesis of an upstream regulatory protein was required for induction of the C/EBPβ gene, HepG2 cells were incubated with thapsigargin in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm cycloheximide (Fig. 4). Cycloheximide completely prevented the increase in C/EBPβ mRNA content following ERSR activation, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis was required at some unidentified step leading to activation of the C/EBPβ gene. Inhibition of protein synthesis may also have a minor effect on the turnover of C/EBPβ mRNA, as indicated by the small, but consistent elevation in mRNA content in cells treated with cycloheximide in the absence of thapsigargin (Fig. 4). Induction of C/EBPβ mRNA Content by the ERSR Is Not Due to mRNA Stabilization—To test for increased mRNA stability as a possible mechanism for the ERSR induction, HepG2 cells were incubated in glucose-free MEM for 8 h to elevate the C/EBPβ mRNA content and were then transferred to either fresh glucose-free MEM or complete MEM, both containing 5 μm actinomycin D (Fig. 5). The results showed that the half-life of C/EBPβ mRNA with or without glucose was ∼1.5 h, indicating that the ERSR-dependent elevation in C/EBPβ mRNA is probably not the result of mRNA stabilization. C/EBPβ Genomic 5′ Upstream Region Does Not Respond to the ERSR—To investigate the role of genomic 5′ upstream sequences in mediating C/EBPβ transcription in response to ER stress, a fragment corresponding to the human C/EBPβ proximal promoter nt –325/+157 was tested initially (Fig. 6). Compared with the 7-fold induction of endogenous mRNA by glucose deprivation or Tg treatment (Figs. 1 and 2), this promoter fragment did not respond to the glucose-limited condition and resulted in less than a 70% increase in Tg-treated cells (Fig. 6B). To test the possibility that the cis-acting elements required for full induction may be located farther upstream, much longer promoter fragments (–1595/+157 and –8451/+157) were examined, but similar results were obtained (Fig. 6B). C/EBPβ Genomic Sequence 3′ to the Protein Coding Sequence Is Essential for the ERSR—As depicted in Fig. 6A, the human C/EBPβ gene is intronless and relative to the transcription start site, the first of multiple translation start sites is at nt +206, and the single translation stop codon is at +1243 (30Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Although not fully characterized, an apparent polyadenylation signal (5′-AATAAA-3′) is ∼1.8 kb downstream from the transcription start (GenBank™ number NM_005194). Given that a 5′ upstream fragment of nearly 8.5 kbp did not support induction by ER stress, the C/EBPβ genomic region 3′ to the protein coding sequence was investigated (Fig. 7). Sequentially deleted fragments were ligated downstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene, driven by a C/EBPβ promoter fragment containing nt –1595 to +157. To approximate the endogenous location, the C/EBPβ 3′ genomic fragments were inserted downstream of the firefly coding sequence within the reporter plasmid. The C/EBPβ sequence from nt +1423 to +3541, containing the sequence corresponding to the mRNA 3′-untranslated region and some additional 3′ genomic sequence, induced transcription by 17-fold when cells were treated with Tg (Fig. 7). The degree of induction was similar when this 2.1-kb genomic sequence was deleted to an 800-bp DNA fragment covering nt +1423–2213. The ER stress-responsive region was narrowed even further by establishing that a 93-bp DNA fragment containing nt +1554–1646 activated transcription (Fig. 7). The 93-bp sequence yielded an induction level of about 8 times the control, less than the longer fragments but nearly identical in magnitude to the maximal increase in endogenous mRNA content following Tg treatment (Fig. 2). The decline in the relative increase was due to an increase in the basal rate rather than a decline in the absolute transcription rate following ER stress. Taken together, the data of Figs. 6 and 7 indicate that the DNA regulatory element necessary to mediate the ERSR activation of the C/EBPβ gene is located 3′ to the protein coding sequence and within nt +1554–1646. C/EBPβ 3′ Genomic Sequence Can Confer ER Stress Responsiveness to an Otherwise Inert Promoter—To test the hypothesis that nt +1554–1646 of the C/EBPβ gene (Fig. 8A) could confer ER stress-regulated transcription to an unrelated promoter, the C/EBPβ promoter fragment used in the previous experiments was replaced with the SV40 promoter (Fig. 8B). The SV40 promoter alone was inert to Tg treatment, but when a single copy of the 93-bp C/EBPβ genomic sequence was present, transcription was induced to 9 times the MEM control. A UPRE-like Binding Site Is Responsible for the Induction of the C/EBPβ Gene by ER Stress—Computer analysis of the 93-bp region revealed no perfect match for either the ERSE (5′-CCAATN9CCACG-3′) (17Yoshida H.

There is considerable interest in understanding how these metalloclusters are assembled in vivo. It has been presumed that immature iron-molybdenum cofactor-deficient nitrogenase MoFe proteins contain the P-cluster, although no biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of this complex cluster has been identified as yet. Through the comparison by iron K-edge x-ray absorption edge and extended fine structure analyses of cofactor-deficient MoFe proteins resulting from nifH and nifB deletion strains of Azotobacter vinelandii, a novel [Fe-S] cluster is identified in the ΔnifH MoFe protein. The iron-iron scattering displayed by the ΔnifH MoFe protein is more similar to that of a standard [Fe4S4]-containing protein than that of the ΔnifB MoFe protein, which is shown to contain a “normal” P-cluster. The iron-sulfur scattering of the ΔnifH MoFe protein, however, indicates differences in its cluster from an [Fe4S4](Cys)4 site that may be consistent with the presence of either oxygenic or nitrogenic ligation. Based on these results, models for the [Fe-S] center in the ΔnifH MoFe protein are constructed, the most likely of which consist of two separate [Fe4S4] sites, each with some non-cysteinyl coordination. This type of model suggests that the P-cluster is formed by the condensation of two [Fe4S4] fragments, possibly concomitant with Fe protein (NifH)-induced conformational change.

The molybdenum-containing system discussed herein is considered to be the “conventional” nitrogenase. A fourth, unrelated, superoxide-dependent nitrogenase system is found in certain thermophilic bacteria (69Ribbe M. Gadkari D. Meyer O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26627-26633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Substrate reduction occurs within the MoFe protein, an α2β2 heterotetramer that contains two unique metalloclusters, the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco) and the P-cluster. The Fe protein, which is the obligate electron donor to the MoFe protein, is a homodimer containing two nucleotide binding sites (one per subunit) and a single [Fe4S4] cluster at the dimer interface. Nitrogenase catalysis consists of a series of Fe protein-MoFe protein complex formation and dissociation reactions in which electrons are sequentially transferred from the [Fe4S4] cluster in the Fe protein through the P-cluster in the MoFe protein to the ultimate site of substrate reduction (FeMoco) concomitant with ATP hydrolysis by the Fe protein. There is substantial interest in elucidating the mechanism by which the metalloclusters of the MoFe protein are formed in vivo because of their importance in nitrogen fixation and because they are biologically and chemically unprecedented. FeMoco is a heterometallic double cubane consisting of one [Fe4S3] and one [MoFe3S3] partial cubane that are bridged by three sulfides and share a μ6-central atom of which the identity is unknown but is considered to be carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen (see Fig. 1) (6Einsle O. Tezcan F.A. Andrade S.L.A. Schmid B. Yoshida M. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 297: 1696-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Situated entirely in the α-subunit, FeMoco is attached to the protein by only two ligands, a cysteine at the terminal iron and a histidine at the opposite molybdenum, which is also coordinated by bidentate homocitrate. The P-cluster, with a topology similar to that of FeMoco, consists of a symmetric double cubane in which two [4Fe-3S] partial cubanes share a central μ6-sulfur atom (see Fig. 1). It is situated at the αβ dimeric interface and is connected to the protein through six cysteine ligands, two terminal and one bridging cysteine from each subunit. The P-cluster can be reversibly oxidized from this native all-ferrous state, designated PN with indigodisulfonate (IDS) to yield a two-electron oxidized state, designated P2+ or POX. Following redox-dependent conformational change, the [Fe4S4] cube associated with the α-subunit is largely unchanged, whereas the [Fe4S4] cube associated with the β-subunit has been opened concomitant with a decrease in the coordination of the central sulfur atom from six to four (Fig. 1) (7Peters J.W.

The two iron atoms that are no longer coordinated by the central sulfur in the POX state remain four-coordinate by forming new bonds, one with the alkoxy group of a neighboring serine and the other with a backbone amide group of a bridging cysteine (7Peters J.W.

The biosyntheses of these complex metalloclusters and the nitrogenase component proteins are controlled by the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes (reviewed in Refs. 9Dean D.R. Jacobson M.R. Stacey G.

The structural genes nifH, nifD, and nifK encode immature forms of the Fe protein (NifH) and the MoFe protein (NifDK). The MoFe protein is activated by the insertion of independently assembled FeMoco. Association with NifM renders the Fe protein catalytically active. The Fe protein has two independent roles in the biosynthesis of nitrogenase that do not require activation by NifM and that are unrelated to its capabilities for nucleotide hydrolysis and electron transfer (14Jacobson M.R.

FeMoco biosynthesis occurs through the action of the Fe protein (NifH), NifB, and NifEN, which are necessary for assembly of the [Fe-S] core of FeMoco, and NifV and NifQ, which are required for homocitrate and molybdenum attachment, respectively. NifB produces NifB-co, an [Fe-S] cluster that provides the specific source of iron and sulfur in FeMoco (22Shah V.K. Allen J.R. Spangler N.J. Ludden P.W. J. Biol.

It is hypothesized that NifB-co is transferred from NifB to NifEN, a complex homologous to the MoFe protein, where it rearranges to form the [Fe-S] core of FeMoco in a reaction that probably proceeds from the conformational interaction between NifEN and the Fe protein (NifH). Molybdenum and homocitrate may, or may not, be inserted at this point, but they are attached prior to the insertion of FeMoco into the MoFe protein. Insertion of the completed cofactor requires the Fe protein (NifH) as well as NifY in Klebsiella pneumoniae, or the non-nif protein γ (NafY) in Azotobacter vinelandii, and the chaperonin GroEL. Much of the current understanding of nitrogenase biosynthesis comes from studying component proteins grown from nif deletion strains of bacteria. It has been presumed that the immature FeMoco-deficient MoFe proteins produced in the absence of the cluster assembly genes contain the P-cluster (24Hawkes T.R. Smith B.E. Biochem.

The identification of unusual P-cluster features in the ΔnifH MoFe protein as compared with the ΔnifB protein, however, indicates a role for the Fe protein (NifH) in the biosynthesis of this cluster (21Allen R.M.

Biochemical and spectroscopic evidence support the presence of a “normal” P-cluster, similar to the cluster in wild-type proteins, in ΔnifB MoFe protein and identify a novel cluster in ΔnifH MoFe protein (28Christiansen J.

Here we extend the understanding of the P-cluster features in ΔnifH MoFe protein through the use of iron K-edge x-ray absorption (XAS) edge and extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses to assess the electronic and structural properties of the [Fe-S] cluster in this protein and the ΔnifB MoFe protein at two oxidation states. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher, Baxter Scientific, or Sigma. Cell Growth and Protein Sample Preparation—A. vinelandii mutant strains DJ1165 and DJ1143 were grown in 180-liter batches in a 200-liter New Brunswick fermentor on Burke's minimal medium supplemented with 2 mm ammonium acetate. The growth rate was measured by cell density at 436 nm using a Spectronic 20 Genesys Spectrophotometer (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY). After consumption of the ammonia, the cells were de-repressed for 3 h followed by harvesting using a flow-through centrifugal harvester (Cepa). The cell paste was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The FeMoco-deficient His-tag MoFe proteins expressed by A. vinelandii DJ1165 (ΔnifH MoFe protein) and DJ1143 (ΔnifB MoFe protein) were purified as described earlier (29Ribbe M.W. Hu Y. Guo M. Schmid B. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All samples were prepared in a Vacuum Atmospheres argon-filled dry box with an O2 level of less than 4 ppm. As isolated, ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins were in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm Na2S2O4 (dithionite-reduced state). If required, MoFe protein samples were oxidized by incubation with excess IDS for 30 min. IDS was subsequently removed by a single passage over an anion-exchange column, as described previously (32Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29678-29685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). IDS-oxidized and dithionite-reduced samples were concentrated in a Centricon-30 (Amicon) concentrator in anaerobic centrifuge tubes outside the dry box. Samples for XAS measurement (60 μl of 19–33 mg/ml protein in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50% glycerol) were loaded into 70-μl Lucite cells with Kapton tape windows and flash frozen in a pentane/liquid nitrogen slush. XAS Data Collection—XAS data were measured at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory under 30-GeV 60–100-mA beam conditions using the 16-pole 2.0-T wiggler beam line 9-3 with a silicon (220) double crystal monochromator and two rhodium-coated mirrors, one flat pre-monochromator mirror for harmonic rejection and vertical collimation and one toroidal post-monochromator mirror for vertical and horizontal focusing. During data collection, the samples were maintained at 10 K in an Oxford Instruments CF1208 continuous flow liquid helium cryostat. Data were collected as iron Kα fluorescence using a Canberra 30-element solid-state germanium detector. The x-ray energy was calibrated to the inflection point at 7111.3 eV of a standard iron foil measured concurrently with the protein samples between two ionization chambers in line with the cryostat. 22–26 scans to a k value of 17 Å–1 were collected for each sample. The edge position at ∼7119 eV was monitored for evidence of photoreduction; no changes were observed in any of the samples. EPR and UV-visible Spectroscopic Analysis—The following spectroscopic features were used to determine the integrity of the samples following x-ray irradiation: (i) the S = ½ perpendicular mode EPR signal in the g ≈ 2 region exhibited by the dithionite-reduced ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins, (ii) the g = 11.8 parallel mode EPR signal of the IDS-oxidized ΔnifB MoFe protein, and (iii) the absorbance of the IDS-oxidized ΔnifH MoFe protein in the visible region at ∼420 nm (29Ribbe M.W. Hu Y. Guo M. Schmid B. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23469-23476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For UV-visible absorption experiments, samples were prepared in anaerobic cuvettes that were previously blanked. Spectra were recorded on an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. All perpendicular and parallel mode EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 Ez spectrophotometer interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. All spectra were recorded at 10 K using a microwave power of 50 milliwatts, a gain of 5 × 104, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 gauss. Microwave frequencies of 9.62 and 9.39 GHz were used for the perpendicular (10 scans) and parallel (20 scans) mode EPR spectra, respectively. Qualitatively and quantitatively indistinguishable spectra were observed in all cases (i–iii) before and after x-ray irradiation. XAS Data Analysis—The iron K-edge XAS data were normalized using the program XFIT (33Ellis P.J. Freeman H.C. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1995; 2: 190-195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by first subtracting a polynomial background absorbance that was fit to the pre-edge region and extended over the post-edge with weighted control points, followed by fitting a three-segment polynomial spline over the EXAFS region, and finally by normalizing the resulting absorbance spectra to an edge jump of 1.0 at 7130 eV. The EXAFS data between k of 2 Å–1 and 15.5 Å–1 were fit with the program suite EXAFSPAK (34.George, G. N.

Biol. 1999; 292: 871-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and the reduced and oxidized ΔnifH MoFe proteins from the 2.2-Å resolution dithionite-isolated A. vinelandii Fe protein (PDB number1G5P) (36Schlessman J.L. Woo D. Joshua-Tor L. Howard J.B. Rees D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 669-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The iron K-edge absorption spectra for the ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins (Fig. 2) are consistent with spectroscopy on similar [Fe-S] cluster-containing proteins, displaying a 1s→3d pre-edge transition at ∼7112 eV and a rising edge with a shoulder at ∼7119 eV (37Musgrave K.B. Angove H.C. Burgess B.K. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5325-5326Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following treatment with IDS, the change to a higher oxidation state in the ΔnifB MoFe protein is evident by a decrease in the intensity of the absorption edge at 7126 eV and by a 0.6-eV energy shift of the shoulder on the rising edge (Fig. 2A). Because the edge represents the average iron site in an eight iron center, large shifts in energy are not expected. A 0.6-eV energy shift due to a two-electron oxidation, or an average change of 0.25 electrons/iron, is consistent with the shifts of 0.4–0.5 eV seen for one-electron oxidations of the [Fe4S4] cluster of the Fe protein (37Musgrave K.B. Angove H.C. Burgess B.K. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5325-5326Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pre-edge transition does not show an appreciable change in energy but does increase in intensity upon oxidation, indicating that there is a greater amount of 4p mixing into the 3d orbitals in the oxidized protein, consistent with a distortion in the geometry of the iron sites (38Westre T.E. Kennepohl P. DeWitt J.G. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6297-6314Crossref Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). The ΔnifH MoFe protein spectra show little change in the position of either the pre-edge or the rising edge upon oxidation, although oxidation of this species is evident by the observed intensity decrease in the edge at ∼7126 eV (Fig. 2B). An overlay of the dithionite-reduced spectra from both protein mutants (Fig. 2C) shows that the rising edges of the two species differ by 0.8 eV and that the ΔnifH MoFe protein edge has greater intensity at 7126 eV. Upon oxidation, the spectra are more similar (Fig. 2D); the ΔnifH MoFe protein edge is shifted to higher energy by only 0.2 eV compared with that of the ΔnifB MoFe protein. The major difference between the two species at this potential is not in the edge at 7126 eV but in the pre-edge, which is more intense in the spectrum of the ΔnifB MoFe protein. The iron K-edge EXAFS spectra and the corresponding Fourier transforms of the ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins shown in Fig. 3 highlight major structural differences between the protein mutants. Notably, there is a second peak in the Fourier transforms of the EXAFS of the ΔnifH MoFe protein at ∼2.4 Å, which appears as a shoulder in those of the ΔnifB MoFe protein, indicating a more ordered arrangement of Fe-Fe scattering in the former species. The position and intensity of the first peak also differs between the ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins, indicating a difference in the Fe-S distances and potentially in the Fe-S coordination numbers between these species. The changes in the transforms with oxidation reveal the structural impact of the redox reaction. Consistent with the edge data, the ΔnifB MoFe protein transform changes significantly upon oxidation, whereas the ΔnifH MoFe protein transform shows little change between the two potentials. EXAFS curve-fitting analysis was used to determine the structure of the [Fe-S] center in the two mutant proteins. The determination of average coordination numbers for an unknown site by EXAFS analysis is complicated by the high degree of correlation between the coordination number, N, and the σ2 parameter (which provides a measure of thermal and static disorder) in a fit (39Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-459Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To overcome this difficulty, coordination numbers are usually fixed to values established by another method. Because no structural data were available for the ΔnifH MoFe protein, Fe-S and Fe-O/N 3Distinguishing between scatterers of similar atomic number is usually not possible in an EXAFS study. coordination numbers were not fixed but were sequentially tested in intervals of 0.25 over a range of appropriate initial distances, whereas the interatomic distance, R, and σ2 were allowed to float (40Pickering I.J. George G.N. Dameron C.T. Kurz B. Winge D.R. Dance I.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 9498-9505Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This procedure was repeated for each scattering interaction in an iterative fashion until a best fit was obtained. The coordination numbers are thus estimates and may be artificially low because of contributions from static disorder. Despite the uncertainty in the absolute coordination numbers, the relations between scatterers (as in the relative ratio of Fe-S to Fe-Fe scatterers or of short- to long-distance Fe-Fe scattering) are considered to be accurate. Three-component fits to the EXAFS from all four proteins are described in Table I. The data quality, evidenced by the signal-to-noise ratio, varied across the samples due to differences in protein concentration. The primary comparison made here is for fits to a k-range over which all samples could be reasonably analyzed. A detailed study of the developed fitting methodology and full k-range fits, including testing of all components, will be published elsewhere.Table IEXAFS fitting results for ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteinsMoFe proteinFe-SFe-Fe (short)Fe-Fe (long)ΔE0ErrorNRσ2NRσ2NRσ2Reduced, ΔnifB3.252.310.00501.752.530.01021.252.760.0077-11.80.54Oxidized, ΔnifB3.252.310.00601.252.480.00481.252.760.0091-10.00.67Reduced, ΔnifH2.752.280.00501.252.490.00871.752.720.0049-13.10.41Oxidized, ΔnifH3.252.280.00651.002.480.00692.002.720.0066-11.50.81 Open table in a new tab Although the average nature of the EXAFS technique makes it difficult to probe changes at individual iron sites, a redox-dependent structural change between the dithionite-isolated and IDS-treated ΔnifB MoFe proteins is apparent. The overall Fe-Fe interaction number drops from 3 to 2.5 with a specific loss in the number of short Fe-Fe distances. The oxidized protein is fit with an even distribution of short and long Fe-Fe distances at 2.48 and 2.76 Å, each having an average of 1.25 scatterers, whereas the reduced protein is fit with Fe-Fe interactions of 1.75 and 1.25 at 2.53 Å and 2.76 Å, respectively. The sulfur environment, which consists of 3.25 Fe-S interactions at 2.31 Å, is constant for the ΔnifB MoFe protein at the two potentials. Unlike the ΔnifB MoFe protein, the ΔnifH MoFe protein shows little structural change upon oxidation. There is a slight shift in the distribution of Fe-Fe interactions from an environment of 1.25 short and 1.75 long distances in the reduced protein to 1.0 short and 2.0 long distances in the oxidized protein. The Fe-Fe distances of 2.48–2.49 Å and 2.72 Å are virtually identical at the two potentials. The sulfur environment does show some sensitivity to oxidation state; the reduced protein is fit with a lower coordination number (2.75) than the oxidized protein (3.25) for the Fe-S interaction at 2.28 Å. XAS edges and EXAFS confirm the presence of a normal P-cluster in the ΔnifB MoFe protein. The fits to the dithionite-isolated protein are in agreement with the 1.16-Å resolution crystal structure of the wild-type MoFe protein, which reports an average iron environment of 3.25 sulfur atoms at 2.31 ± 0.03 Å, 0.75 sulfur atoms at 2.44 ± 0.03 Å, 1.75 iron atoms at 2.58 ± 0.06 Å, and 1.25 iron atoms at 2.80 ± 0.05 Å for the closest interactions (6Einsle O.

Initial cloning reports implicated HPK1 in the activation of stress kinases (SAPKs/JNKs) (3Hu M.C. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.H.

It has also been shown that physiological concentrations of prostaglandin E2 raise HPK1 kinase activity in T cells and myeloid cells by a yet undefined mechanism, possibly leading to the suppression of fos gene transcription (12Sawasdikosol S. Russo K.M. Burakoff S.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 3687-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, a single report suggests a role for HPK1 in erythropoietin-induced signaling of two cell lines (13Nagata Y. Kiefer F. Watanabe T. Todokoro K. Blood. 1999; 93: 3347-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but this finding remains unconfirmed for primary erythroid progenitor cells. HPK1 is presumed to act as a MAP4K (MAP kinase kinase kinase kinase). Its potential substrates include the mixed lineage kinase MLK3, the mitogenic kinase MEKK1, the transforming growth factor-β activated kinase TAK1 (8Kiefer F. Vogel W.F. Arnold R. Transpl.

HPK1(-/-) mice have been generated by targeted gene disruption but exhibit no obvious phenotype. 3F. Kiefer, personal communication. This may not be entirely surprising, given that HPK1 is just one member of a family of similar kinases with hematopoietic expression (1Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 2Sells M.A. Chernoff J.

Close relatives with overlapping expression patterns include GCK, kinase homologous to SPS1/STE20 (syn. GCKR), HPK1/GCK-like kinase (named NIK in mice) and germinal center-like kinase. The targeted disruption of multiple GCK family kinase genes in mice may eventually shed more light on HPK1 functions. Physical interactions of HPK1 with other intracellular proteins in vitro and in vivo have been reported in numerous studies. The T-cell adaptor SLP-76 and its B-cell relative BLNK, also known as SLP-65 or BASH, are functionally important interaction partners of HPK1 and crucial in the signal transmission of TCR and BCR, respectively (5Liu S.K.

Of these, Mona/Gads binding to HPK1 was clearly demonstrated in mouse T cells by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins (5Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The same study implicated the fourth proline-rich motif in the non-catalytic part of HPK1 as the binding region for Mona/Gads but did not provide details regarding the HPK1 residues crucial for high affinity binding. We and others have recently shown that the SH3C domain of Mona/Gads can interact with nanomolar affinity with a SLP-76 motif, which lacks a typical PXXP motif (23Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T.

In this study, the interaction of HPK1 with Mona/Gads was initially analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Subsequently, a suitable fragment of HPK1 in complex with Mona/Gads SH3C was crystallized and studied by x-ray crystallography. The structure of the Mona/Gads SH3C-HPK1 peptide complex was solved to 1.5-Å resolution. The data show that, different from the interaction of Mona/Gads SH3C with SLP-76, a PXXP motif, which is part of a polyproline type II helix, is essential for complex formation of murine Mona/Gads SH3C and HPK1. Alanine scanning and crystal contacts define the residues PXVPXRXXK as key sites for complex formation. Peptide synthesis as well as expression and purification of murine Mona/Gads SH3C were done as described previously (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G.

Janssen. Expression and glutathione-Sepharose purification of this fusion protein was done under the same conditions as for Mona/Gads SH3C. The functionality of the construct had been previously confirmed in precipitation experiments using Sos-containing cell lysate. ITC was done essentially as described previously (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Briefly, ITC measurements were performed on a VP-ITC MicroCalorimeter (MicroCal, Northhampton, MA). 1.43 ml of 0.05 mm affinity-purified GST-SH3 domain in ITC buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate) was clarified for 10 min at 20,800 × g and degassed for 10 min with Thermovac (MicroCal) before being transferred into the sample chamber. Synthetic peptides were diluted to 0.5 mm in ITC buffer, clarified, and degassed, and ∼300 μl was loaded into the syringe. During the measurements, 5- and 10-μl aliquots of peptide solution were titrated once and 28 times, respectively, into the sample chamber at an equilibrium temperature of 25 °C. The heat of dilution was negligible. Total heat generated and Kd values were calculated in ORIGIN (V5.0). For crystallization, the Mona/Gads SH3C construct at 15 mg/ml was mixed with the 16-residue HPK1 peptide P5 at a 1:3 molar ratio. Crystals were obtained with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C overnight under equilibration conditions of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 m (NH4)2SO4 (Index Screen, Hampton Research). These were cryoprotected through transfer into mother liquor containing 20% glycerol and vitrified. Single wavelength data were collected on BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France (see also Table II). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (25Navaza J. Saludjian P.

Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, HPK1, which also binds to Mona/Gads independently of tyrosine phosphorylation, lacks such a PX2DRX2KP motif (Fig. 1A). Instead, the implicated region in HPK1 contains only an RXXK motif in the mouse protein and a KXXK motif in the human protein. Additionally, HPK1 proteins have a cluster of proline residues N-terminal to the R/KXXK motif, which is not present in SLP-76, and could possibly contribute to Mona/Gads SH3C binding. To test this hypothesis, peptides corresponding to 26 amino acids of the relevant region in mouse and human HPK1 (Table I, P1 and P2) were analyzed for binding by ITC. Both peptides bound to Mona/Gads SH3C with affinities of 4 and 21 μm, respectively. These are typical affinities for known SH3 domain-peptide interactions.Table IBinding affinities of mouse HPK1 peptides for SH3 domains Peptide binding to SH3 domains was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Mouse Mona/Gads SH3C (amino acids 256–322) and Grb2 SH3N (amino acids 3–57; sequence identical between mouse and human) were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. nbd, no binding detectable; tlq, affinity too low for accurate quantification, marginal binding; S.D. = standard deviation for two measurements; HAGBP, high affinity Grb2 SH3N binding peptide, similar to Sos sequence. The PXXPXR motif (arrows) is considered to be crucial for Grb2 SH3N binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Open table in a new tab The essential Mona/Gads SH3C binding region in mouse HPK1 was further mapped by analyzing shorter overlapping HPK1 fragments (Table I, P3–P8). A representative example of an ITC measurement is shown in Fig. 1B. P7, a 14-amino-acid motif, was the shortest sequence with an affinity significantly below 10 μm. Further truncation by 3 amino acids (P8) resulted in a 4–5-fold decreased affinity. An alanine scan through P8 subsequently defined the motif PXVPXRX2K as essential for mouse HPK1 binding to Mona/Gads SH3C (Table I, P9–P19). As discussed above, HPK1 has several proline-rich stretches in the non-catalytic part of the protein. In one study, using human HPK1, a region different from the site implicated in the mouse HPK1 has been suggested as the preferential binding site for Mona/Gads SH3C (6Ma W. Xia C. Ling P. Qiu M. Luo Y. Tan T.H. Liu M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A corresponding peptide (P20) was therefore also tested for binding to Mona/Gads SH3C by ITC. However, the affinity of this peptide was considerably lower than that of P1, and no further studies were performed with it. The Mona/Gads SH3C binding motif identified in mouse HPK1 clearly overlaps with the PXXPXR core consensus motif for binding of the N-terminal SH3 domain of the Mona/Gads-relative Grb2 as defined previously in several studies (Ref. 28Posern G. Zheng J. Knudsen B.S. Kardinal C. Muller K.B. Voss J. Shishido T. Cowburn D. Cheng G. Wang B. Kruh G.D. Burrell S.K. Jacobson C.A. Lenz D.M. Zamborelli T.J. Adermann K. Hanafusa H. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1903-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and references therein). Grb2 appears to be ubiquitously expressed and might therefore compete with Mona/Gads for some binding partners. Consequently, the affinity of the Grb2 SH3N domain for two HPK1-derived peptides (Table IB, P5 and P8) was also determined. Surprisingly only marginal binding was detected, although an ITC measurement with another PXX- PXR-containing peptide (Table IB, P21) clearly showed that the expressed Grb2 SH3N domain is functional. The significant differences between the HPK1 sequence that binds to Mona/Gads SH3C and the well characterized SH3C binding motif in SLP-76 prompted us to further analyze the Mona/Gads SH3C-HPK1 peptide interaction by x-ray crystallography. Structure of the Mona/Gads SH3C Domain in Complex with an HPK1-derived Peptide—Diffracting crystals were obtained from a complex of Mona/Gads SH3C with HPK1-derived peptide P5. Data and refinement statistics are summarized in Table II. The structure of the complex was solved to 1.5-Å resolution by molecular replacement. A schematic overview of the SH3 domain in complex with the HPK1 peptide is shown in Fig. 2. The structure of the SH3C domain itself remains unaffected by HPK1 peptide binding, retaining all the structural characteristics described previously (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The typical β-barrel SH3 domain presents the same binding pocket to the HPK1 peptide as in the case of the SLP-76 peptide (stereo view shown in Fig. 3A), although the interactions between domain and peptide in this structure vary considerably from those established in the previous complex (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Sixteen structured residues comprise the HPK1 peptide in its bound conformation (distinguished from the SH3 domain residues by * in the subsequent text). The distinct structural characteristics within the peptide are a 310 helix from residues Arg-9* to Lys-12* and a polyproline type II (PPII) helix of residues Gln-2* to Pro-7* (Figs. 2 and 3B). Although the 310 helix is also present in the high affinity SLP-76 peptide described previously, the PPII helix within the HPK1 peptide is clearly novel for a Mona/Gads SH3C interaction.Fig. 3Divergent stereo electrostatic potential surface representations of the Mona/Gads SH3C with the docked peptide(s) in stick representation. Negative potential is drawn in red, and positive potential is drawn in blue. A, superposition of a HPK1 peptide P5 (green) and an SLP-76 peptide (yellow) on the Mona/Gads SH3C domain.

C, atom-specific coloring of the P5 residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A multitude of interactions defines the HPK1 peptide-Mona/Gads SH3C domain interface. Starting from the N terminus of the HPK1 peptide (P5), the first 3 residues do not contribute to binding, although Pro-3* engages in a very weak hydrophobic interaction with Tyr-8. Pro-4* appears to be the first residue vital for peptide docking (Fig. 3C). The pyrrolidine ring of this residue rests in a hydrophobic groove formed by Tyr-52 and Tyr-8 stacking against the phenyl ring of the former and positioned at a 90° angle to the latter. This interaction is further reinforced by a hydrogen bond from the backbone carboxyl oxygen of Pro-4* to the hydroxyl of the Tyr-52 side chain. Leu-5* exhibits only a single hydrogen bond docking the peptide main chain to Nδ2 of Asn-51. The next hydrophobic groove along the path of the HPK1 peptide on the domain surface is formed by residues Tyr-52, Pro-59, Phe-10, and Trp-36. Tight hydrophobic interactions in this region maintain the side chains of Val-6*, and to a lesser degree Pro-7*, firmly locked in place, making their presence indispensable for tight peptide binding. The pyrrolidine ring of Pro-8* stacks against the aliphatic portion of the Glu-11* side chain. Hydrogen bonds from the backbone oxygen of Pro-8* to the nitrogen of the indole ring of Trp-36 and the backbone amine of Glu-11* dock the peptide main chain onto the SH3 surface and onto itself, stabilizing the 310 helix of P5, which emerges past this point. The charged interactions of amino acids Arg-9* and Lys-12*, which flank the 310 helix, involve a tight network of hydrogen bonds with residues of the Mona/Gads SH3C. Specifically, Nϵ and Nη1 of Arg-9* form hydrogen bonds to Oϵ1 and Oϵ2 of Glu-17, and Lys-12* Nζ forms hydrogen bonds to Glu-14 Oϵ1, Glu-17 Oϵ2, and Asp-16 Oδ1 in a manner identical to that observed in the binding of the SLP-76 peptide to the same interaction surface (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, Lys-12* further stacks against the indole ring of Trp-36. Lys-10* does not contribute to SH3 domain binding at all, whereas the aliphatic portion of the Glu-11* side chain stacks between Lys-16 and Pro-8*. All residues of the 310 helix contribute hydrogen bonds toward the formation of the secondary structure element itself. The 4 C-terminal residues of P5 do not participate in protein docking and have no direct interaction with any of the Mona/Gads residues in the vicinity. The observed intra-peptide interactions therein only provide structure to this end of the peptide. Data obtained from binding experiments with SH3- and HPK1-derived Ala mutant peptides in solution (Table I, ITC data) and the contact points between SH3 and HPK1 peptide identified in the crystal structure (summarized in Fig. 1A, indicated by arrows) agree in clearly delineating the residues PXVPXRXXK in mouse HPK1 as important for Mona/Gads SH3C binding. This motif differs considerably from the previously identified contact motif PXIDRXXKPXL derived from the SLP-76 protein (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although the RXXK core motif is present in both mouse proteins. Nevertheless, it is evident from the human HPK1 sequence (Fig. 1A) that the arginine can be substituted with a lysine, leaving only a single lysine residue as a strictly conserved position. It is therefore not possible to effectively predict additional candidate binding partners of Mona/Gads SH3C. Comparison of the Mona SH3C-HPK1 Peptide Complex with Other SH3 Domain Complexes—We have previously reported the atomic structure of a SLP-76-derived peptide in complex with Mona/Gads SH3C (24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The HPK1- and SLP-76-derived SH3C binding peptides both share the 310 helical secondary structure, and accordingly, the respective RXXK motifs are positioned in similar spatial arrangements. Strikingly, although the SLP-76 peptide lacks a PPII helical segment, its C-terminal region occupies approximately the same space as the PPII helix on the hydrophobic surface region of the SH3C (Fig. 3A). The buried surface areas at the SH3-peptide interfaces are quite similar, 1048 Å2 for the bound HPK1 peptide as compared with 1143 Å2 for the complexed SLP-76 peptide and therefore do not provide a simple explanation for the considerable differences in binding affinity of the SLP-76 versus the HPK1 peptide (0.181 and 2.4 μm, respectively; Table I, P5, and Ref. 24Harkiolaki M. Lewitzky M. Gilbert R.J. Jones E.Y. Bourette R.P. Mouchiroud G. Sondermann H. Moarefi I. Feller S.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2571-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar. Stable conformational characteristics of the HPK1 peptide can be identified by analysis of the comparative mean square atomic displacement values (〈u2〉), which provide an indication of the positional stability of each atom in the crystal structure (Fig. 4A). Temperature factors (B = 〈u2〉8π2/3) of P5 atoms fluctuate between 9.6 and 30.9 Å2. This variability is introduced by the terminal residues of the peptide, which are not stabilized by binding to any docking regions on the face of the Mona/Gads domain. The core of P5, defined by the bulk of the two secondary structure arrangements present, one 310 and one PPII helix, is extremely stable. Residues 4* to 12*, which are directly involved with SH3 domain binding, exhibit average B values for main chain atoms of 12.6 Å2 with the side chain atoms showing only marginally higher values averaging 13.8 Å2. Although a direct comparison with the previous Mona/Gads SH3C complex with an SLP-76 peptide is not possible due to variability in crystallographic data quality and crystal lattice environment, we can normalize the average B values for the atoms of the peptides implicated in SH3C binding to a common mean value. Comparative values generated thus suggest that the binding stability of"

Here, we demonstrate the role of DGKγ in regulating Rac1-governed cell morphology. We found that the expression of kinase-dead DGKγ, which acts as a dominant-negative mutant, and inhibition of endogenous DGKγ activity with R59949 induced lamellipodium and membrane ruffle formation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts in the absence of growth factor stimulation. Reciprocally, lamellipodium formation induced by platelet-derived growth factor was significantly inhibited upon expression of constitutively active DGKγ. Moreover, the constitutively active DGKγ mutant suppressed integrin-mediated cell spreading. These effects are isoform-specific because, in the same experiments, none of the corresponding mutants of DGKα and DGKβ, closely related isoforms, affected cell morphology. These results suggest that DGKγ specifically participates in the Rac1-mediated signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal reorganization. In support of this, DGKγ co-localized with dominant-active Rac1 especially in lamellipodia. Moreover, we found that endogenous DGKγ was physically associated with cellular Rac1. Dominant-negative Rac1 expression blocked the lamellipodium formation induced by kinase-dead DGKγ, indicating that DGKγ acts upstream of Rac1. This model is supported by studies demonstrating that kinase-dead DGKγ selectively activated Rac1, but not Cdc42.

It is well recognized that a variety of lipid second messengers in low abundance carry out specific tasks for a wide range of biological processes in eukaryotic cells.

DAG is an established activator of conventional and novel protein kinases C (PKCs), Unc-13, and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (2Nishizuka Y.

Thus, DGK can potentially participate in a diverse range of cellular events through modulating the balance between two bioactive lipids, DAG and PA. Mammalian DGK is known to exist as a large protein family consisting of nine isozymes classified into five subtypes according to their structural features (12Sakane F. Kanoh H. Int. J. Biochem.

These subfamilies can be characterized by the presence of a variety of regulatory domains of known and/or predicted functions, clearly indicating their distinct functions and regulatory mechanisms. The type I DGKs, presently consisting of α-, β-, and γ-isozymes (16Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T.

The distinctive tissue- and cell-dependent expression patterns detected for these isozymes suggest that, even belonging to the same subfamily, each member exerts differentiated functions in particular types of cells (12Sakane F.

Moreover, we recently reported that the EF-hand motifs of the type I DGKs have properties distinct from each other with respect to affinities for Ca2+ and to Ca2+-induced conformational changes (24Yamada K. Sakane F. Matsushima N. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Among the type I DGKs, DGKα has recently been the subject of intensive investigations (25Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez A.-C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26San Juan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J.

However, the functions of the type I DGKs other than the α-isozyme have not yet been defined, and it remains unknown to what extent the functions of the three type I DGKs are redundant or distinct. Recently, we provided results suggesting that DGKγ negatively regulates macrophage differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 and U937 cells through its catalytic action (29Yamada K. Sakane F. Imai S. Tsushima S. Murakami T. Kanoh H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that after phorbol ester treatment, DGKγ translocates from the cytoplasm to the cell periphery, resulting in its co-localization with F-actin. In addition, rat brain DGKγ was reported previously as a cytoskeleton-associated isozyme (21Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, the physiological implication of the cytoskeleton association of DGKγ remains to be further explored. In this work, to reveal cytoskeleton-related targets and regulators of DGKγ, we examined the effects of enzyme expression on cytoskeletal changes using NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whose F-actin-driven morphological changes are well characterized. Interestingly, a kinase-dead mutant of DGKγ enhanced lamellipodium/membrane ruffle formation in the cells in the absence of growth factor stimulation. In contrast, the corresponding mutants of DGKα and DGKβ, closely related isoforms, failed to affect cell morphology. Several lines of evidence strongly suggest that DGKγ operates as a novel negative regulator of Rac1. Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, cells were used for further analysis. Plasmid Constructs—The kinase-dead (DGKα-G435D and DGKγ-G494D) and constitutively active (DGKα-(Δ1–192) and DGKγ-(Δ1–259)) versions of pig DGKα and human DGKγ were generated as described previously (22Sakane F.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding DGKβ-(Δ1–232) (constitutively active version) was generated from a rat DGKβ cDNA clone (19Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The kinase-dead version of DGKβ (DGKβ-G495D) was generated by replacing Gly495 with Asp using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The human cdc42, rac1, and rhoA cDNAs were amplified by PCR using human whole brain cDNA (BD Biosciences) as template and then subcloned into the pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences, Tokyo) or pECFP-C1 (BD Biosciences) expression vector. A dominant-active form of Rac1 (Rac1-G12V) was generated by replacing Gly12 with Val using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. A dominant-negative mutant of Rac1 (Rac1-T17N) was generated by replacing Thr17 with Asn. The authenticity of the cDNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fluorescence Microscopy—For immunofluorescence microscopy, NIH3T3 cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with expression plasmids containing cDNAs for DGKγ and Rho family small G-proteins N-terminally fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). After 24 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. When F-actin staining was required, cells were permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were then incubated with phalloidin conjugated with rhodamine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or with Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, OR). The coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were examined using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. For living cell imaging, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids encoding YFP-DGKγ and CFP-small G-proteins and observed in glass bottom chambers (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo). When fluorescence microscopy was carried out, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 without phenol red and buffered with 15 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were examined using the Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope. To assess the extent of lamellipodium/membrane ruffle formation, cells were stained for F-actin using rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. Random fields of the cells were photographed, and >50 cells exhibiting fluorescence were examined. Cells exhibiting clearly discernible lamellipodia/membrane ruffles (in most cases, >10 μm in width) (see Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) were scored positive.Fig. 2Effects of DGKγ and its mutants on lamellipodium/membrane ruffle formation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts.A, fluorescence images of NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing GFP-tagged DGKγ and its mutants. GFP-tagged DGKγ-WT, DGKγ-G494D (kinase-dead), DGKγ-(Δ1–259) (constitutively active), DGKα-G435D (kinase-dead), or DGKβ-G495D (kinase-dead) was expressed transiently in NIH3T3 cells. After 12 h of cDNA transfection, cells were serum-starved for 12 h. The fixed cells were stained for F-actin using phalloidin.

The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The Western blot (WB) was probed with anti-DGKγ serum. With longer exposures, DGKγ was slightly detectable in the Input lane. Input represents 5% of the starting materials (cell lysates). C and D, effects of R59949 on NIH3T3 cell morphology.

After 12 h of cDNA transfection, cells were serum-starved for 12 h. Fluorescence images of the fixed cells were obtained using inverted confocal laser scanning microscopy. Because the patterns of F-actin (phalloidin) staining were almost identical to those of Rac1 and DGKγ mutants at the cell periphery (data not shown; see Figs. 1, 2, and 6), lamellipodium/membrane ruffle formation was expediently judged with CFP and YFP staining patterns in this experiment.

They were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and those coated with fibronectin were blocked with 1% lipid-free and protease-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Transfected cells were detached by trypsinization for 5 min and suspended for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 0.2% lipid-free and protease-free bovine serum albumin, and 0.4% methylcellulose (ICN, Tokyo), which prevented cell-cell aggregation. The suspended cells were replated on the fibronectin- or poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated phalloidin. Cells were examined using a fluorescent microscope. Spreading was quantified by photographing more than six random fields of the cells and counting the transfectants with a spread morphology (see Fig. 5). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and PCR amplification were performed as described (30Sakane F. Imai S. Yamada K. Murakami T. Tsushima S. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43519-43526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). PCR amplification was performed with KOD Plus (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers as follows: mouse DGKγ forward primer, 5′-GATGAGCGAAGAACAATGGG-3′ (nucleotides 32–51); mouse DGKγ reverse primer, 5′-CCTGAGGTCGCCCGGTC-3′ (nucleotides 538–554); mouse DGKβ forward primer, 5′-CCATGACAAACCAGGAAAAATGG-3′ (nucleotides 425–447); and mouse DGKβ reverse primer, 5′-CCTCGGGTCTTCCTCTTTCG-3′ (nucleotides 868–887). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min; and 68 °C for 7 min. As a control, mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was simultaneously amplified. PCR products amplified were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—NIH3T3 cells (∼1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently transfected with p3xFLAG-CMV-DGKγ-WT together with pECFP alone, pECFP-RhoA-WT, pECFP-Rac1-WT, or pECFP-Cdc42-WT. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 500 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Tokyo), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma)). The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates (input). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-GFP antibody was carried out as described previously (31Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35323-35332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In some experiments, anti-DGKγ serum (2 μl) (20Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to precipitate endogenous DGKγ. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates (input) and immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, Tokyo) and blocked with Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Tokyo). The membrane was incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (B-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-DGKγ serum in Block Ace for 1 h. The immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). To measure the relative density of immunoreactive bands, images were scanned and analyzed by NIH Image software. Pull-down Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Rac1, which was bacterially expressed and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), was loaded with either 1 mm GDPβS (Sigma) or 100 μm GTPγS (Sigma) at 30 °C for 2 h. COS-7 cells (∼1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish) expressing (FLAG)3-tagged DGKγ were lysed in 1 ml of buffer A. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates (input). Cell lysates (250 μl) were incubated with 5 μg of the GST fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C with constant rocking. The beads were washed four times with buffer A and once with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The washed beads were then boiled in SDS sample buffer, and the extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG and anti-GST (B-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies. Affinity Precipitation of Activated Rac1—NIH3T3 cells (∼1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish) were transiently cotransfected with pECFP-Rac1-WT and either p3xFLAG-CMV-DGKγ-G494D or p3xFLAG-CMV-DGKγ-(Δ1–259). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 18–24 h and then harvested with 500 μl of buffer A containing 4 μg of GST-fused p21-binding domain (PBD) of p21-activated kinase (PAK), which binds GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 specifically. The mixture was incubated on ice at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to give cell lysates (input). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were added to the lysates and then further incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rocking. The bead pellets were washed five times with 500 μl of buffer A and finally suspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. The proteins extracted were analyzed by immunoblotting. The GTP-bound form of Rac1 thus recovered was detected by Western blotting using anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. In this case, GST-PAK-PBD present in the precipitates and DGKγ mutants in the lysates were detected with anti-GST and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, respectively. When the effect of a DGK inhibitor (R59949) on the activation state of endogenous Rac1 was examined, non-transfected NIH3T3 cells were used. In this case, the GTP-bound form of Rac1 recovered was detected by Western blotting using anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (clone 23A8, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). DGK Activity Assay—The octyl glucoside mixed micellar assay of DGK activity was done as described previously (32Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 50 mm octyl glucoside, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm phosphatidylserine, 1.5 mm DAG, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (10,000 cpm/nmol; ICN). The reaction was initiated by adding cell lysates (5 μg of protein) and continued for 5 min at 30 °C. Lipids were extracted from the mixture, and PA separated by thin-layer chromatography was scraped and counted using a liquid scintillation spectrophotometer. Kinase-dead DGKγ Induces Lamellipodium/Membrane Ruffle Formation in NIH3T3 Fibroblasts—We first examined the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged DGKγ transiently expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2040931402,"Three subfamilies of mammalian Class 1 processing α1,2-mannosidases (family 47 glycosidases) play critical roles in the maturation of Asn-linked glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex as well as influencing the timing and recognition for disposal of terminally unfolded proteins by ER-associated degradation. In an effort to define the structural basis for substrate recognition among Class 1 mannosidases, we have crystallized murine Golgi mannosidase IA (space group P212121), and the structure was solved to 1.5-Å resolution by molecular replacement.

In contrast to an analogous complex previously isolated for Saccharomyces cerevisiae ER mannosidase I, the oligosaccharide in the active site of the murine Golgi enzyme assumes a different conformation to present an alternate oligosaccharide branch into the active site pocket.

A Man6GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide attached to Asn515 in the murine enzyme was found to extend into the active site of an adjoining protein unit in the crystal lattice in a presumed enzyme-product complex.

The processing of Asn-linked oligosaccharides in mammalian organisms is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the action of α-glucosidases and α-mannosidases that cleave the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure primarily to a specific Man8GlcNAc2 isomer (Man8B) 1The abbreviations used are: Man8B, an isomer of Man8GlcNAc2 where the central branch mannose residue had been removed from the standard Man9GlcNAc2 structure (see Fig. 1); dMNJ, 1-deoxymannojirimycin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation; EDEM, ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein; NAG, N-acetylglucosamine; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. (Fig. 1). Following transport to the Golgi complex, further trimming of α1,2-mannose residues results in the production of a Man5GlcNAc2 structure (1Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. II. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 81-117Google Scholar). These trimming reactions are followed by additional modifications, catalyzed by glycosyltransferases and hydrolases, to yield the array of complex structures on cellular and secreted glycoproteins (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). The Class 1 mannosidases (family 47 glycosidases) play several roles in the oligosaccharide-trimming reactions in the ER and Golgi (for reviews, see Refs. 1Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P.

Three subfamilies of mammalian Class 1 mannosidases have been identified; the ER mannosidase I subfamily cleaves a single residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to generate the Man8B structure (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. II. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 81-117Google Scholar), the Golgi mannosidase I subfamily cleaves Man9-8GlcNAc2 structures to Man5GlcNAc2 (Fig. 1, A and C), and the EDEM subfamily of mannosidase-related proteins does not appear to have an intrinsic hydrolase activity but appears to be required for disposal of terminally misfolded glycoproteins by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (8Oda Y.

In comparing the substrate specificities of ER and Golgi mannosidase I, these enzymes were found to have differences in both degree of mannose trimming as well as branch specificity for substrate recognition. ER mannosidase I preferentially cleaves the α1,2-mannose residue on the central branch of the Man9GlcNAc2 structure (residue M10; Fig. 1B) to produce the Man8B isomer (3Herscovics A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20Lipari F. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Puccia R.

In contrast, the Golgi mannosidase I family members (designated IA, IB, and IC) preferentially cleave residue M11 or M9, followed by residue M8 (Fig. 1C (23Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Tremblay L.O. Campbell Dyke N. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). The order of initial mannose removal (M11 versus M9) varies among the Golgi mannosidase I family members, but all of the mammalian family members tested thus far have a relatively poor efficiency for cleavage of the α1,2-mannose designated M10 (the target of ER mannosidase I action). Thus, the ER and Golgi mannosidase I families of enzymes have complementary and largely nonoverlapping substrate specificities, despite their similarities in protein sequence and presumed protein fold (1Moremen K. Ernst B. Hart G. Sinay P. Oligosaccharides in Chemistry and Biology: A Comprehensive Handbook. II. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York2000: 81-117Google Scholar). The structural basis for glycone recognition by Class 1 mannosidases was revealed through the co-crystallization of human ER mannosidase I with the mannose mimics, 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMNJ) and kifunensine (Fig. 1D) (25Vallee F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41287-41298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were found to occupy the -1 mannose site (based on established glycosidase subsite nomenclature (26Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar)) through a direct coordination of the O-2′ and O-3′ hydroxyls to an enzyme-bound calcium ion and a collection of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that stabilized the binding of the inhibitors in the equivalent of an unusual 1C4 sugar conformation. The structural basis for the branch specificity in substrate recognition by ER mannosidase I was previously described for the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Vallee F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of this enzyme revealed an oligosaccharide attached to one protein unit of the crystal lattice extending into the active site of an adjoining protein molecule in a proposed enzyme-product complex. Sugar residues of the oligosaccharide extended from the proposed +1 enzyme subsite, with the -1 mannose subsite unoccupied. A key Arg residue (Arg273), conserved among the ER mannosidase I subfamily of enzymes, was found to interact with several residues in the substrate and contribute to branch specificity. These interactions with Arg273, along with other hydrogen bonding interactions with the glycan across the oligosaccharide binding cleft, resulted in the insertion of residue M7 into the +1 binding site. This enzyme-product complex presumably mimics the insertion of residues M7 and M10 of the nascent Man9GlcNAc2 substrate into the respective +1 and -1 binding sites during a catalytic cycle that would result in glycoside bond cleavage and the production of the Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B (28Romero P.A.

Mutation of Arg273 to Leu resulted in a low efficiency enzyme with a hybrid activity between ER mannosidase I and Golgi mannosidase I; it cleaved Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2 by the removal of M10, M11, M8, and finally M9 (28Romero P.A.

Recent structural studies on Class 1 α-mannosidases from Tricoderma reesei (29Van Petegem F. Contreras H. Contreras R. Van Beeumen J. J. Mol.

In an effort to define the structural basis for substrate recognition among the Golgi mannosidase I subclass of enzymes, we chose to study murine Golgi mannosidase IA (23Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The structure of this enzyme revealed a protein fold and catalytic site that was similar to other Class 1 mannosidases. Surprisingly, the single N-glycan on the murine glycoprotein was found to extend into the +1 mannose position of the enzyme binding site in an adjoining protein unit in the crystal lattice in a presumed enzyme-product complex analogous to the structure of S. cerevisiae ER mannosidase I. In contrast to the yeast enzyme structure, an alternative oligosaccharide conformation was bound to the active site pocket, and a distinct monosaccharide was found in the presumed +1 binding site. A comparison of the geometry and topology of the oligosaccharide binding cleft between the various Class 1 mannosidases indicates that ER and Golgi mannosidases have a high potential for selective substrate binding resulting from substrate interactions in a constricted binding cleft. Comparisons of the glycan structures bound in the active sites of the yeast and murine enzymes provide insights into the structural basis for substrate recognition among these Class 1 mannosidases. Golgi ManIA Purification and Crystallization—The cDNA encoding the soluble catalytic domain of mouse Golgi mannosidase IA (31Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9872-9881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector, pHIL-S1, as a fusion protein with the yeast α-factor signal sequence (23Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The final construct was transformed into the GS115 Pichia host strain by selection for reversion in His auxotrophy as previously described (23Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The strain was grown in a 100-ml shake flask culture in BMGY medium overnight and used to inoculate a 7-liter culture in minimal medium (33Cregg J.M. Vedvick T.S. Raschke W.C. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 905-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) in a New Brunswick BioFlow 3000 fermentor. After growth to a cell density of 300 g/liter using glycerol as a carbon source, the culture was starved for ∼10 h and grown on 0.5% MeOH as an inducing agent and carbon source for 3 days (maintained using a MeOH probe and monitor (Raven Biotech) to control feed rate). The medium was harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 20 min. The enzyme was purified in batches of 2 liters by dialysis against 8 liters of 10 mm sodium succinate (pH 6.5) using 24,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis tubing with two changes of buffer. Prior to column chromatography, the dialysate was adjusted to pH 5.5 with HCl. The dialyzed medium was loaded at 10 ml/min onto an SP-Sepharose column (1.5 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (10 mm sodium succinate, pH 5.5), washed with >100 ml of Buffer A, and eluted with a gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing mannosidase activity were pooled, adjusted to 1.0 m (NH4)2SO4 and pH 6.5 with 0.1 m Na-HEPES buffer. The pooled enzyme sample was then loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1.5 × 20 cm); washed with 1.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 6.5); and eluted using a linear gradient of 1.0 to 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 6.5). Fractions containing enzyme activity were pooled and concentrated using an Amicon YM10 membrane following the addition of NDSB-201 (Calbiochem) to 0.75 m. Aliquots of 5 ml of concentrated enzyme sample were applied to Super-dex-75 column (1 × 100 cm) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Na-MES (pH 6.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.75 m NDSB-201. The final purified enzyme was concentrated to 30 mg/ml in the same buffer and stored at 4 °C. The enzyme was screened for crystallization conditions as previously described (32Vallee F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) using a microbatch technique. The best crystals were obtained using precipitant conditions of 15-20% polyethylene glycol 4000 and pH 4.5-6.5. Co-crystallization of the enzyme in the presence of dMNJ was attempted using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. For crystallization, the above enzyme solution (19 μl) was incubated with 1 μl of a 200 mm stock solution of dMNJ (Oxford Glycosystems) at 37 °C for 2 h. The hanging drop was then prepared by mixing an equal volume of protein/dMNJ solution (1 μl) with a crystallization solution containing 100 mm MES, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 25-35% polyethylene glycol 4000, pH 6.0. Single crystals were formed in 2 days at 18 °C and used for structure determination. Data Collection—Data were collected with a Smart 6000 CCD detector (Bruker AXS) on an FRD rotating copper anode source equipped with HiRes2 optics (Rigaku/MSC). Data collection was carried out in three passes with 600 images collected in each pass (Δω = 0.3°) at a crystal to detector distance of 9 cm. For pass 1, 2θ = 25° and ϕ = 0°; for pass 2, 2θ = 25° and ϕ = 90°; for pass 3, 2θ = 0° and ϕ = 0°. Integration and scaling were performed with the Proteum software suite (Bruker AXS). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the CNS software suite (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar)) was repeatedly iterated with refinement of coordinates and isotropic temperature factors (Refmac5 (37Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A.

Patel P. Acta. Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Anisotropic refinement of temperature factors was introduced once the crystallographic residual was reduced to 17.1% (19.0% for free reflections) and resulted in only a slight drop of the residuals and improved conformance with geometric parameters (39Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar). Protein structural alignments and r.m.s. deviation measurements were generated using Swiss-PdbViewer (version 3.7) (40Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). All protein and glycan structure figures were prepared using MacPymol (version 0.95; Delano, W. L. Pymol Molecular Graphics System (2002) available on the World Wide Web at www.pymol.org) to generate rasterized images. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization of Golgi Mannosidase IA—The soluble catalytic domain (amino acid residues 66-655 (31Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Expression was accomplished by fermentation in minimal medium with initial growth in glycerol as a carbon source followed by growth and induction using methanol as a carbon source once high cell density was achieved (32Vallee F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Optimized fermentation strategies using this recombinant host have routinely yielded as much as 100 mg/liter crude recombinant enzyme in the culture medium. Chromatographic purification using a combination of ion exchange, phenyl-Sepharose, and gel filtration columns resulted in the isolation of the homogeneous enzyme. An important element in the purification strategy was the inclusion of NDSB-201 in all of the buffers following the phenyl-Sepharose step through to protein crystallization. This compound has been found to aid in blocking protein aggregation during in vitro protein folding and crystallization studies (42Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Goldberg M.E. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Significant losses in the recovery of recombinant Golgi mannosidase IA by aggregation and precipitation were avoided by inclusion of NDSB-201 in all of the buffers. Previous purification and crystallization of recombinant mouse Golgi mannosidase IA under different conditions (32Vallee F. Lal A. Moremen K.W. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 571-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) resulted in crystals that diffracted to 2.8 Å (space group P2221, unit cell dimensions a = 54.9 Å, b = 135.1 Å, c = 69.9 Å). The structure of this prior crystal form was not solved. In the present study, the crystals were obtained with a P212121 space group (unit cell dimensions of a = 55.3 Å, b = 72.2 Å, c = 129.6 Å) and diffracted to 1.51 Å (Table I). A single monomer was found in the asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using the human ER mannosidase I structure (25Vallee F. Karaveg K. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W.

The calcium ion and oligosaccharide structure were modeled into the remaining densities following the construction of the protein model. The structure model traces a continuous amino acid sequence from residues 178-644 indicating that 112 NH2-terminal and 11 COOH-terminal amino acids were cleaved from the recombinant protein during expression and purification. NH2-terminal protein sequence data, SDS-PAGE mobility, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of the protein all indicated that proteolysis had occurred, resulting in a protein of similar size to the sequence resolved in the crystal structure (not shown). In addition, the side chains of 18 surface-exposed residues (predominately Lys, Arg, and Glu residues) were not resolved in the final structure, presumably due to flexibility of the side chains in the solvent.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsParameterValueUnique reflections73,142Mean redundancy6.38Resolution (high resolution shell, Å)62.50-1.51 (1.63-1.51)Completeness (%)89.2 (56.8)Rsym (%)6.0 (14.7)Space groupP212121Cell dimensions (Å)a = 55.3 b = 72.2 c = 129.6Resolution range in refinement (Å)62.50-1.51Unique reflections in refinement (free set)65,697 (3,689)Mean B value (from Wilson plot, Å2)12.2 (9.7)R (Rfree, %)17.1 (19.0)r.m.s. bond lengths (Å)0.012r.m.s. bond angles (degrees)1.4 Open table in a new tab Overall Structure of the Molecule—The overall structure of the molecule consists of an (αα)7 barrel (Fig. 2), similar to other family 47 glycosylhydrolases (25Vallee F.

One end of the barrel has hairpin loop crossovers between the alternating inner and outer helices (short connection side (SC side), Fig. 2), and this side of the barrel also contains a COOH-terminal β-hairpin that extends into the mouth of the cylinder to form a plug at the bottom of the cavity. Residue Thr635, at the apex of the β-hairpin in the interior of the barrel cavity, is directly involved in coordination of a calcium ion in the core of the barrel (through the carbonyl oxygen and Oγ). Other conserved acidic residues in the interior of the barrel cavity are involved in forming a hydrogen-bonding network through six water molecules to result in a calcium ion containing an 8-coordinate pentagonal bipyramid geometry common to other family 47 glycosidases (25Vallee F.

https://openalex.org/W1967501036,"Rpn7 is one of the lid subunits of the 26 S proteasome regulatory particle. The RPN7 gene is known to be essential, but its function remains to be elucidated. To explore the function of Rpn7, we isolated and characterized temperature-sensitive rpn7 mutants. All of the rpn7 mutants obtained accumulated poly-ubiquitinated proteins when grown at the restrictive temperature. The N-end rule substrate (Ub-Arg-β-galactosidase), the UFD pathway substrate (Ub-Pro-β-galactosidase), and cell cycle regulators (Pds1 and Clb2) were found to be stabilized in experiments using one of the rpn7 mutants termed rpn7-3 at the restrictive temperature, indicating its defect in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Subsequent analysis of the structure of the 26 S proteasome in rpn7-3 cells suggested that the defect was in the assembly of the 26 S holoenzyme. The most striking characteristic of the proteasome of the rpn7-3 mutant was that a lid subcomplex affinity-purified from the rpn7-3 cells grown at the restrictive temperature contained only 5 of the 8 lid components, a phenomenon that has not been reported in the previously isolated lid mutants. From these results, we concluded that Rpn7 is required for the integrity of the 26 S complex by establishing a correct lid structure.

From these results, we concluded that Rpn7 is required for the integrity of the 26 S complex by establishing a correct lid structure. The 26 S proteasome is a protein complex with a molecular mass of ∼2000 kDa and is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. It is essential not only for eliminating damaged or misfolded proteins but also for degrading short lived regulatory proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, signal transduction, apoptosis, and metabolic regulation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1999; 50: 57-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The proteins must be poly-ubiquitinated before they are recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome. The poly-ubiquitination of a target protein involves the following three enzymes: first ubiquitin (Ub) 1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; CP, core particle; GAD, GAL4 activation domain; GBD, Gal4 binding domain; MALDI/TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame; PCI, proteasome/COP9/initiation factor; RP, regulatory particle; Rpn, regulatory particle non-ATPase; Rpt, regulatory particle triple A-ATPase; Suc, succinyl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; UFD, ubiquitin fusion degradation.1The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; CP, core particle; GAD, GAL4 activation domain; GBD, Gal4 binding domain; MALDI/TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; ORF, open reading frame; PCI, proteasome/COP9/initiation factor; RP, regulatory particle; Rpn, regulatory particle non-ATPase; Rpt, regulatory particle triple A-ATPase; Suc, succinyl; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; UFD, ubiquitin fusion degradation. is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme to produce a ubiquitin-activating enzyme-Ub thioester bond, then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to produce ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-Ub, and finally a ubiquitin-protein ligase transfers the ubiquitin to a Lys residue of the target protein by making an isopeptidyl bond (reviewed in Ref. 1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar). Ubiquitins are linked to each other through isopeptidyl bonds at their Lys-48 to produce a polyubiquitin chain that serves as the degradation signal (3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 4Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M.

Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Some proteins require the activity of an additional chain elongation factor for their poly-ubiquitination (6Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Although primarily the process of ubiquitination has been emphasized in terms of the regulation of proteolysis, it is possible that the 26 S proteasome, the final degradation machinery, plays some regulatory roles in proteolysis. The 26 S proteasome consists of two kinds of subcomplexes, a 20 S core particle (CP) and a 19 S regulatory particle (RP). The CP has a cylinder-like structure composed of a stack of two α rings and two β rings in the order of αββα, each of which consists of seven related subunits. The active sites are sequestered in the cavity of the CP (7Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). Crystallographic study revealed that the gate of the CP allows the entry of substrate proteins only upon binding with the RP (8Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). The RP contains at least 17 subunits and is responsible for the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. The 26 S proteasome has the RP attached on either end of the CP (RP1CP) or at both ends of the CP (RP2CP). The RP can be further divided into two subcomplexes, the base and the lid (9Glickman M.H.

The base consists of six AAA-ATPase subunits (Rpt1–Rpt6) and two non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1 and Rpn2), whereas the lid is made of eight non-ATPase subunits (Rpn3, Rpn5–Rpn9, Rpn11, and Rpn12) (9Glickman M.H.

To understand further the biochemical processes conducted by the 19 S RP, it is necessary to uncover how individual components of the RP are functioning. At present, some components have been studied in detail. Of the 19 S components, Rpn10 and Rpt5 have been suggested to be responsible for the recognition of substrate through its poly-ubiquitin chain (5Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L.

Multiple deubiquitinating enzymes are thought to be involved in ubiquitin recycling, and Rpn11 metalloisopeptidase, one of the lid components, is shown to play an essential role in cleaving off the Ub chain from poly-ubiquitinated substrate proteins (16Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Although functional characterization of the RP has progressed considerably, little is known about the mechanism of its assembly. Interactions among lid (17Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and base components (18Gorbea C. Taillandier D. Rechsteiner M. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1999; 26: 15-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were studied by using yeast two-hybrid analysis. Obviously more information concerning individual subunits of the lid is necessary for a more detailed understanding of the function of the lid as well as the 26 S proteasome in relation to various phenomena. In this study, we focused on Rpn7, whose function has only been poorly understood, by isolating and characterizing temperature-sensitive rpn7 mutants. The data presented below suggest that Rpn7 is essential for the construction of the lid and for the structural integrity of the 26 S proteasome. Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—Yeast strains used in this work are listed in Table I. Cells were cultured in the synthetic complete (SC) medium, rich medium (YPD) (19Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar), or the synthetic medium with 2% raffinose and without uracil (SR-U). Synchronous cultures were prepared by adding α-factor to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml to the BAR1 strain or 1 μg/ml to the bar1Δ strain. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (supE44 ΔlacU169 [ϕ80lacZ ΔM15] hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1) was used for construction and propagation of plasmids. E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain (Novagen) was used for production of the Rpn7-6xHis recombinant protein. Yeast transformations were performed as described previously (20Burk D. Dawson D. Stearns T.

Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2000; 75: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The adenine residue of ATG corresponding to the putative translation initiation codon was defined as the +1 nucleotide. In brief, the RPN7 ORF and the 3′-untranslated region (+1 to +1501) amplified by PCR using a pair of primers, 5′-CCTTGTCGACGTAGACGTGGAAGAGAAAAG-3′ and 5′-CCTTGCGGCCGCTTGCAATTATGTAACTTTC, and genomic DNA of W303-1A as template was cloned between the SalI and NotI site of the YIp vector pRS306 (22Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A BamHI site was introduced at +132–137 in the RPN7 ORF. Mutations were introduced into the RPN7 coding region (+1 to +1501) by random PCR mutagenesis (23Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar) using this plasmid as a template with the same pair of primers shown above. The resulting PCR products were inserted into the SalI-NotI site of pRS306 and used to transform E. coli strain DH5α. Colonies were harvested en masse, and the plasmid DNA recovered from them was stored as the mutation library of RPN7. The library DNA was digested at the BamHI site and was introduced into W303-1B cells to replace the RPN7 gene with the mutated rpn7 gene in the library. About 1,200 colonies were screened on the basis of a growth defect at 37 °C, and six candidates were obtained. These candidates were crossed with W303-1A and were subjected to tetrad analysis. Thus, the linkage between temperature-sensitive growth and the plasmid marker URA3 was established, indicating that the temperature sensitivity was because of the rpn7 mutations incorporated. Cytological Methods—Microscopic photos were taken using an Olympus BX52 with an UplanApo 100X/1.35 objective and a CCD camera (Hamamatsu photonics) attached to CSU21 (Yokogawa). Images were analyzed by the IPLab (Scanalytics) software. DNA was stained with 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. DNA Manipulation—DNA engineering and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed as described elsewhere (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy dye terminating method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) using automated DNA sequencer ABI 310 (Applied Biosystems). Anti-Rpn7 Rabbit Antibody—The ORF of RPN7 without the stop codon was cloned into the BamHI-XhoI site of pET21a (Novagen), and the resulting plasmid, pEK106, was introduced into the E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain (Novagen). Production of Rpn7-6XHis was induced by adding 0.2 mm isopropylthio-β-galactoside to the culture. Cells were harvested from 500 ml of culture after 10 h of induction at 25 °C, and the Rpn7 protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) under a denaturing condition. 2 mg of the purified protein was used to raise antibodies in rabbit. The serum was first purified using the HiTrap Protein G HP (Amersham Biosciences) and further by Rpn7-coupled HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Extraction, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Yeast total proteins were extracted as follows. Cells were grown to late log phase, harvested by centrifugation, and broken with inner diameter, 0.5-mm, glass beads in cold Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) supplemented with Protease Complete Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) using a multibeads shocker (MB501, YASUI KIKAI Corp.). ATP and MgCl2 were added at the final concentrations of 2 and 10 mm, respectively, and a 1× ATP regeneration system was added to the extract for nondenaturing PAGE, gel filtration chromatography, and affinity purification. Protein samples for Western blotting were prepared by the alkali method as described previously (26Kushnirov V.V. Yeast. 2000; 16: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, and Western blotting were performed according to the standard protocol. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Antibodies used for Western blotting were anti-Cdc2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-c-Myc Ab-1 (Oncogene), anti-HA 16B12 (Babco), anti-Rpn9 (27Takeuchi J. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Tanaka K. Toh-e A.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and anti-Rpn7 antibodies. β-Galactosidase Assay—Cells carrying plasmid encoding Ub-Ala-β-galactosidase, Ub-Pro-β-galactosidase, or Ub-Arg-β-galactosidase were grown in 20 ml of SR-U medium to mid-logarithmic phase at 25 °C supplemented with 2% galactose and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Cell extracts were prepared as described above and subjected to β-galactosidase assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as substrate as described previously (31Asakawa K. Yoshida S. Otake F. Toh-e A. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1437-1450PubMed Google Scholar). Nondenaturing PAGE—Protein samples were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE as described previously (9Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Total proteins were extracted as described above, and 5× loading dye (75% glycerol with xylene cyanol) was added to the protein samples prior to loading onto the gels. Electrophoresis was run at 15 mA for 4 h at 4 °C. The gels were overlaid with 0.1 mm Suc-LLVY-MCA in the running buffer with or without 0.05% SDS for 10 min at room temperature, and proteasome bands were visualized upon exposure to 360 nm of UV light and photographed using Polaroid T667 films. Gel Filtration—Yeast total lysates were prepared as described above and filtrated through an inner diameter 0.2-μm syringe filter (Millipore). Samples (4 mg of protein) were applied onto a Superose 6 column (1.0 × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by running Buffer A supplemented with 1 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2, at 0.25 ml/min using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions (500 μl/tube) were collected and subjected to measurement of peptidase activity using Suc-LLVY-MCA as a substrate by a fluorophotometer (F-2000 Hitachi) (excitation at 380 nm; emission at 460 nm). Proteasomal components contained in the fractions were detected by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Affinity Purification of Proteasomes—Yeast strains with one of the following tagged genes, PRE1-3xFLAG, RPN1-3xFLAG, and RPN11-3xFLAG, were constructed as described previously (32Saeki Y. Saitoh A. Toh-e A. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Yeast total lysate was prepared from the indicated strain as described above, and 10 μl of anti-FLAG antibody immobilized M2 beads washed with Buffer A were added to 200 μl of the lysate (20 mg of protein) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with Buffer A, and the purified proteasomes were eluted with 30 μlof0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized with 1 μl of 1.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8. For the affinity purification of the wild type lid, the 26 S proteasome was washed with buffer containing a high concentration of salt as described previously (33Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The 26 S proteasome was first purified from a Rpn11–3xFLAG-tagged Δrpn10 (YYS99) strain, and the beads were treated with 1 m NaCl containing Buffer A for 20 min at room temperature before eluting with 0.2 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptides (Sigma). Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels were photographed using an image analyzer (LAS-3000, Fujifilm), and protein bands were quantified with the Image Gauge (Fujifilm) software. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel, destained, and digested in the gel with 15 μlof10 μg/ml modified trypsin (Promega) in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The resulting peptides were desalted using ZipTipμ-C18 (Millipore) and mixed with 3 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in a 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile mixture. Peptide mass fingerprints of proteins were obtained by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), Voyager DE-PRO (Applied Biosystems). Data base search was performed using the MS-Fit program (prospector.ucsf.edu/ucsfhtml4.0/msfit.htm). Isolation of Temperature-sensitive rpn7 Mutants—We isolated six temperature-sensitive rpn7 mutants as described under “Experimental Procedures,” which were named rpn7-1–rpn7-6 (Fig. 1A). All the mutations were linked to the RPN7 locus. To confirm that their temperature-sensitive growth was because of the mutations in RPN7, a single copy plasmid carrying the wild type allele was introduced into each of the rpn7 mutants, and the ability of a representative transformant to grow at 37 °C was tested. The single copy RPN7 gene complemented the temperature sensitivity of the rpn7 mutants, whereas the vector alone did not restore their growth (Fig. 1B). Rpn7 Protein Levels in rpn7 Mutants—Next we examined whether the temperature-sensitive growth was caused by a reduction in the protein level of Rpn7 in the mutant cells. To test this, total proteins were extracted by the alkaline extraction method from wild type and rpn7-1–rpn7-6 mutant cells cultured either at the permissive (25 °C) or restrictive (37 °C) temperature and subjected to Western blotting using an anti-Rpn7 antibody (Fig. 1C). A slight reduction of the Rpn7 protein level was indeed observed in mutants like rpn7-1 even at the permissive temperature. However, notably rpn7-3 retained a protein level as high as wild type cells both at the permissive and restrictive temperatures. None of the mutants showed the reduction of the amounts of Rpn7 at the restrictive temperature compared with the permissive temperature. Poly-ubiquitinated Proteins Are Accumulated in the rpn7 Mutants at the Restrictive Temperature—The 26 S proteasome is a key mechanism for the degradation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Therefore, poly-ubiquitinated proteins accumulate in mutants defective in the proteasome function in yeast (13van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D.

Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 965-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the rpn7 mutation upon the proteasomal function, we performed Western blotting against total cell extracts using FK2 antibody (30Fujimuro M. Sawada H. Yokosawa H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). For this purpose, overnight cultures of wild type and rpn7-1–rpn7-6 mutants in YPD were diluted into fresh YPD. Each culture was incubated at 25 °C to early log phase, divided into two portions, and grown further at either 25 or 37 °C for 6 h. Total cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 1D). Accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins was observed in samples prepared from rpn7 mutants grown at 37 °C, whereas it was not the case in wild type extracts as well as in rpn7 mutant cells grown at 25 °C. This suggests that proteolysis by the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome system is not properly functioning in the rpn7 mutants under the restrictive conditions. To investigate further the deficiency of rpn7 mutants in protein degradation, we performed two experiments by using the rpn7-3 strain. We chose this allele for detailed analysis because the abundance of Rpn7-3 was comparable with that of Rpn7 (Fig. 1C). First we tested the degradation of model substrates, Ub-Ala-β-galactosidase, Ub-Arg-β-galactosidase, and Ub-Pro-β-galactosidase (41Bachmair A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Science. 1986"
https://openalex.org/W2034933548,"Neprilysin (NEP) is a rate-limiting amyloid β peptide (Aβ)-degrading enzyme in the brain. We demonstrated previously that overexpression of neprilysin in primary cortical neurons remarkably decreased not only extracellular but also intracellular Aβ levels. To investigate the subcellular compartments where neprilysin degrades Aβ most efficiently, we expressed neprilysin chimeric proteins containing various subcellular compartment-targeting domains in neurons. Sec12-NEP, β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase-NEP, transferrin receptor-NEP, and growth-associated protein 43-NEP were successfully sorted to the endoplasmic reticulum, trans-Golgi network, early/recycling endosomes, and lipid rafts, respectively. We found that intracellularly, wild-type neprilysin and all the chimeras showed equivalent Aβ40-degrading activities. Aβ40 was more effectively cleared than Aβ42, and this tendency was greater for intracellular Aβ than for extracellular Aβ. Wild-type and trans-Golgi network-targeted ST-NEP cleared more intracellular Aβ42 than the other chimeras. Wild-type neprilysin cleared extracellular Aβ more effectively than any of the chimeras, among which endoplasmic reticulum-targeted Sec12-NEP was the least effective. These observations indicate that different intracellular compartments may be involved in the metabolism of distinct pools of Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) to be retained or recycled intracellularly and to be secreted extracellularly, and that the endogenous targeting signal in wild-type neprilysin is well optimized for the overall neuronal clearance of Aβ.

Wild-type neprilysin cleared extracellular Aβ more effectively than any of the chimeras, among which endoplasmic reticulum-targeted Sec12-NEP was the least effective. These observations indicate that different intracellular compartments may be involved in the metabolism of distinct pools of Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) to be retained or recycled intracellularly and to be secreted extracellularly, and that the endogenous targeting signal in wild-type neprilysin is well optimized for the overall neuronal clearance of Aβ.

Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5196) Google Scholar). Aβ is a physiological peptide, the steady-state level of which is strictly determined through a balance between the anabolic and catabolic activities. Changes in the metabolic balance are closely associated with Aβ accumulation, because an increase in Aβ anabolic activity causes Aβ deposition in almost all cases of familial AD (2Saido T.C. Neurosci. News. 2000; 3: 52-62Google Scholar, 3Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). In sporadic AD brains, where elevation of anabolism seems to be rare, a reduction in catabolic activity involving Aβ-degrading enzyme(s) has been a candidate cause that may account for Aβ accumulation. Recently, several proteases, such as neprilysin (4Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Hama E. Lee H.J. Saido T.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar), insulin-degrading enzyme (5Farris W. Mansourian S. Chang Y. Lindsley L. Eckman E.A. Frosch M.P. Eckman C.B. Tanzi R.E.

Sambamurti K. Eckman C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2081-2084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), have been identified as Aβ-degrading enzymes in the brain by reverse genetic studies. Deficiencies of these proteases were associated with an elevation of brain Aβ levels in each case, demonstrating that a reduction in the catabolic activity will also contribute to AD development by promoting Aβ accumulation. Although these peptidases are likely to contribute to overall Aβ clearance in the brain by complementing each other in a subcellular, cell type- and/or brain region-specific manner, neprilysin seems to play the primary role among all the Aβ-degrading enzymes thus far examined (8Saito T. Takaki Y. Iwata N. Trojanowski J. Saido T.C. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; (2003 3:PE1)PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saido T.C. Nakahara H. Saido T.C. Aβ Metabolism and Alzheimer's Disease. Landes Bioscience, Georgetown, TX2003: 61-80Google Scholar). It is also important that the in vivo action of neprilysin in the brain is quite selective for Aβ; neprilysin deficiency does not elevate the levels of such “neprilysin substrate” neuropeptides as enkephalin (10Saria A. Hauser K.F. Traurig H.H. Turbek C.S. Hersh L. Gerard C. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 234: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), cholecystokinin, neuropeptide Y, and substance P, 2N. Iwata and T. C. Saido, unpublished data. indicating the presence of redundant buffering mechanisms to metabolize these peptides. Moreover, brain neprilysin expression was selectively reduced not only in aged rodents (11Iwata N. Takaki Y. Fukami S. Tsubuki S. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 70: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) but also in the early stages of sporadic AD cases (12Yasojima K. Akiyama H. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 297: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 13Yasojima K. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Brain Res. 2001; 919: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that up-regulation of neprilysin in the brain may prevent AD development by increasing Aβ clearance. Neprilysin is a type II membrane protein with a catalytic site on the extracytoplasmic side and emerges on the cell surface through the secretory pathway. Aβ is generated in several organelles, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trans-Golgi network (TGN), and endosome (14Echeverria V. Cuello A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Ling Y. Morgan K. Kalsheker N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 1505-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that lipid rafts, in which neprilysin is detectable (16Angelisova P. Drbal K. Horejsi V. Cerny J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1437-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kanemitsu H. Tomiyama T. Mori H. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 23: 113-116Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar), could be involved in Aβ generation (18Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We showed that not only extracellular but also cell-associated Aβ levels were reduced by overexpression of neprilysin in primary cortical neurons using Sindbis viral vector (20Hama E. Shirotani K. Masumoto H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that neprilysin may degrade Aβ through a secretory pathway and possibly on the cell surface. In this study, we constructed several neprilysin chimeric proteins for targeting to particular organelles, such as ER, TGN, and early/recycling endosomes, and lipid raft fractions, and we investigated the sites of neuronal subcellular compartments that might be closely associated with Aβ metabolism. For this purpose, we used well characterized organelle-targeting domains derived from type II transmembrane proteins or a transmembrane-associated protein, which show the same orientation of peptide sequence on the membrane as neprilysin. We replaced the transmembrane domain of neprilysin with that of Sec12p, which is essential for retention in ER (21Sato M. Sato K. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For TGN and endosome targeting, we fused the extracellular domain of neprilysin to the intracellular and transmembrane regions derived from β-galactoside α2,6-sialyltransferase (ST) or transferrin receptor (TfR), which contains the TGN (22Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or early/recycling endosomes (23West A.E. Neve R.L. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6038-6047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) retention motif, respectively. Finally, the N-terminal domain of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) (24Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was fused to the N terminus of neprilysin for delivery to the lipid raft fraction. In addition to these neprilysin chimeric proteins, we expressed wild-type and inactive mutant neprilysin as positive and negative controls, respectively, in primary cortical neurons by use of the Semliki Forest virus (SFV) gene expression system, and we examined their effects on Aβ clearance. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal (56C6) and rabbit polyclonal (H-321) antibodies to the extracellular domain of human neprilysin were purchased from Novocastra Laboratories (Newcastle, UK) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) and anti-adaptin γ mouse monoclonal antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-syntaxin 13 mouse monoclonal antibody was from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (British Columbia, Canada), and fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-rat microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) antiserum was described previously (25Nukina N. Ihara Y. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1983; 59: 284-287Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant SFV Vectors and Infection—Human wild-type and inactive mutant neprilysin cDNAs in pBluescript II KS (+) were prepared as described previously (20Hama E. Shirotani K.

The cDNAs encoding neprilysin chimeric proteins for targeting of neprilysin enzyme activity to a particular organelle or lipid raft fraction, Sec12-neprilysin (NEP) to ER, ST-NEP to TGN, TfR-NEP to early/recycling endosomes, and GAP43-NEP to lipid raft fraction were constructed as follows. Neprilysin cytoplasmic domain fragment encoding amino acid residues 1–27 (NEP/CD1–27) was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGAAGCTTTAGGTGATGGGCAAGTCAGAAAGT-3′ and 5′-GGGGCGCCCAGTGGAGTCCATCGCTGTTTCTT-3′), and then digested with HindIII and NarI. Yeast Sec12p transmembrane domain fragment (Sec12/TMD) encoding amino acid residues 355–373 was made by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides (5′-CGCCTTTTTCACCAACTTCATCCTTATTGTGCTGCTTTCTTACATTTTACAGTTCTCCTAT-3′ and 5′-ATAGGAGAACTGTAAAATGTAAGAAAGCAGCACAATAAGGATGAAGTTGGTGAAAAAGG-3′). Neprilysin extracellular domain encoding amino acid residues 55–750 (NEP/ECD55–750) was constructed by ligation of a PCR product using two oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGCCCGGGATTTGCAAGTCATCAGACTGC-3′ and 5′-TCCAGTGCATTCATAGTAATCTCT-3′) and an XbaI-digested fragment of neprilysin cDNA in pBluescript II, and then digested with HindIII and SmaI. Finally, three DNA fragments, NEP/CD1–27, Sec12/TMD, and NEP/ECD55–750, were ligated, resulting in Sec12-NEP. For ST-NEP construction, rat ST cytoplasmic domain encoding residues 1–38 (ST/CD1–38) was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GGAAGCTTTCCTGTCTGGACCATTCATTATGA-3′ and 5′-GGCAGCTGCAGTGTAAGGGCCTCATAGTC-3′) and rat ST cDNA as a template, digested with HindIII and PvuII, and ligated with NEP/ECD55–750. For TfR-NEP construction, human TfR cytoplasmic domain encoding residues 1–94 (TfR/CD1–94) was amplified by PCR using primers (5′-GGAAGCTTCTGTGTGGCAGTTCAGAATGATGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCCGGGTTCTACCCCTTTACAATAGCC-3′) and human liver cDNA library as a template, digested with HindIII and SmaI, and ligated with NEP/ECD55–750. For GAP43-NEP construction, human GAP43 N-terminal domain encoding residues 1–20 was fused to the N terminus of neprilysin by ligation of a EcoRV-digested fragment of neprilysin cDNA in pBluescript II and two pairs of oligonucleotides (5′-AGGGACGAGACAACCATGCTGTGCTGTATGAGAAGAACCAAACAGGTTGAAAAAAATGAT-3′/5′-TTCAACCTGTTTGGTTCTTCTCATACAGCACAGCATGGTTGTCTCGTCCCT-3′ and 5′-GACGACCAAAAGATTATGGGCAAGTCAGAAAGTCAGATGGATATAACTGAT-3′/5′-ATCAGTTATATCCATCTGACTTTCTGACTTGCCCATAATCTTTTGGTCGTCATCATTTTT-3′). All cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and inserted into a pSFV1 vector (Invitrogen). To prepare a recombinant viral vector, each cRNA was transcribed from the SapI-linearized DNAs with SP6 RNA polymerase and then cotransfected together with pSFV-Helper1 RNA into baby hamster kidney cells using the Gene Pulser electroporation system (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The conditioned medium containing the recombinant viral vectors was collected at 24 h after transfection and stored at –80 °C until use. Primary cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic C57BL/6CrSlc mice as described previously (20Hama E. Shirotani K. Masumoto H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Infection was carried out by adding the viral vector solution to culture medium of cortical neurons (3–4 × 107 cells), which had been cultured for 7–9 days. At 16 h after the infection, the conditioned medium and the cell lysate were subjected to assay. When neurons were moved from in vivo conditions to in vitro conditions, the expression level of neprilysin declined for unknown reasons. Western Blot Analysis and Assay for Neutral Endopeptidase Activity— Infected neurons were extensively washed with PBS, collected, and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. Aliquots of the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using 56C6 and to assay for neutral endopeptidase activity using benzyloxycarbonyl-alanyl-alanyl-leucine-p-nitroanilide (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) as a substrate, as described previously (26Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol.

Shirotani K. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Neprilysin-dependent neutral endopeptidase activity was evaluated from the decrease in the rate of digestion caused by 10 μm thiorphan, a specific inhibitor of neprilysin. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For Western blot-based quantitative analysis, the intensities of immunoreactive bands were measured with a densitometer, LAS-3000 and Science Lab 2001 Image Gauge software (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Primary neurons cultured on coverslips were infected with recombinant viral vectors and processed for double immunofluorescence staining after the cells had been treated with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 as described previously (20Hama E. Shirotani K. Masumoto H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using the following sets of primary antibodies and appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies as follows: 56C6/anti-rat MAP-2 antibody and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, anti-BiP antibody/H-321, anti-adaptin γ antibody/H-321 or anti-syntaxin 13 antibody/H-321, and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG/Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The immunofluorescence signals were observed under an IX70 inverted microscope incorporating a confocal laser scanning system FV300 (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The digital images were captured with Fluoview, version 3.2 software (Olympus Optical), using a ×100 objective. Eight-bit gray scale images were saved as digitized tagged image format files to retain maximum resolution. Colocalized areas of immunoreactive neprilysin and each marker protein in neurons were quantitated using image analysis software, MetaMorph, version 6.1 (Nippon Roper, Chiba, Japan). Each set of experiments was repeated at least two times. Lipid Raft Fractionation—Virus-infected neurons (1 × 108 cells) were extensively washed with PBS, collected, and homogenized in MES-buffered saline (MBS: 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics), and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A (Peptide Institute) through a 22-gauge needle (20 passages) on ice, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, 2 ml of the supernatant was mixed with an equivalent volume of 80% sucrose solution, and overlaid sequentially with 4 ml of 35% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose. The gradient was centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 21 h with an SW41 rotor, and then 12 fractions (1 ml each) were collected from top to bottom. The pellet (fraction 13) was resuspended in 1 ml of MBS by sonication. Aliquots of all fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis to evaluate targeting of GAP43-NEP chimeric protein to the lipid raft fraction. Measurement of Aβ —Extracellular Aβ in conditioned medium and intracellular Aβ extracted with 6 m guanidine HCl from cultured neurons were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (20Hama E.

Expression of Neprilysin Chimeric Proteins in Primary Cortical Neurons—Expression levels and relative molecular masses of wild-type, inactive mutant neprilysin, and the neprilysin chimeric proteins (Fig. 1) in primary neurons were analyzed by Western blotting at 16 h after the transfection with SFV vector (Fig. 2, A and B). Anti-neprilysin antibody 56C6 used here recognizes the extracellular domain of neprilysin, which is shared by all the constructs. Sec12-NEP showed a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, which is similar to that of the wild-type and mutant neprilysin. The molecular masses of ST-NEP, TfR-NEP, and GAP43-NEP were slightly altered from that of the wild type in accordance with the changes in the amino acid residues (see Fig. 1). The mutant, ST-NEP, TfR-NEP, and GAP43-NEP chimeric proteins were expressed at similar levels to the wild-type, but the expression level of Sec12-NEP was 60% lower than those of the others (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Expression of neprilysin and neprilysin chimeric proteins in primary cortical neurons infected with SFV vector. A, cell lysates (5 μg) from cells expressing wild-type neprilysin (wt), inactive mutant neprilysin (mut), Sec12-NEP chimera (Sec12), ST-NEP chimera (ST), TfR-NEP chimera (TfR), and GAP43-NEP chimera (GAP43) were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-neprilysin antibody 56C6. B, quantitative analysis of expression levels of neprilysin and neprilysin chimeric proteins. Intensities of immunoreactive bands shown in A were quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The linearity of the Western blot data has been confirmed.

The efficiencies, defined as the ratio of neprilysin-positive neurons to MAP-2-positive neurons, were 67.8 ± 12.3% for the wild-type, 69.1 ± 11.9% for the mutant, 74.6 ± 14.4% for Sec12-NEP, 54.8 ± 5.4% for ST-NEP, 64.7 ± 19.5% for TfR-NEP, and 62.0 ± 13.2% for GAP43-NEP infectants, indicating that all viral vectors had similar titers. Therefore, the reduced expression of Sec12-NEP was not caused by inefficient infection. We speculate that it probably was a consequence of rapid turnover of the expressed protein retained in ER rather than a reduction in transcription or translation, because Sec12-NEP and wild-type neprilysin share identical N-terminal amino acid sequences (see “Discussion” for further speculation). Levels of thiorphan-sensitive endoproteolytic activity to hydrolyze benzyloxycarbonyl-alanyl-alanyl-leucine-p-nitroanilide were essentially consistent with the protein expression levels of the wild-type or neprilysin chimeric proteins except for Sec12-NEP (Fig. 2C). ST-NEP, TfR-NEP, and GAP43-NEP infectants showed peptidase activities comparable with that of the wild-type infectants. The mutant showed no enzymatic activity, as reported previously (20Hama E. Shirotani K. Masumoto H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Devault A. Nault C. Zollinger M. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Crine P. Boileau G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4033-4040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity in Sec12-NEP infectants was detectable and statistically significant (p < 0.05 as compared with the inactive mutant) but much lower than the others. However, this relatively low activity still seems to be sufficient to clear intracellular Aβ (see below). Localization of Neprilysin Chimeras in Neurons—We performed double immunofluorescence microscopy using organelle markers to confirm sorting of neprilysin chimeric proteins to an appropriate organelle (Fig. 3A). The wild-type neprilysin showed a partial co-localization with each organelle marker protein (Fig. 3A, panels 1, 3, and 5), indicating that wild-type neprilysin is not exclusively transported to or retained in a particular compartment. Expression of our targeting constructs successfully sorted Sec12-NEP, ST-NEP, and TfR-NEP to the expected organelle in neurons as follows. Sec12-NEP was extensively distributed in cell somas, showing localization similar to that of ER marker BiP (Fig. 3A, panel 2). ST-NEP was detected overlapping with a TGN marker adaptin γ appearing as speckles near the nucleus (Fig. 3A, panel 4). TfR-NEP was detected as vesicular structures throughout the cytoplasm, colocalizing with an early/recycling endosomes marker syntaxin 13 (Fig. 3A, panel 6). The distributions of Sec12-NEP, ST-NEP, and TfR-NEP in the target organelles were increased 2.1-, 3.1-, and 2.1-fold, compared with those of wild-type neprilysin, respectively (p < 0.05). We next examined targeting of GAP43-NEP to the lipid raft fraction by using sucrose gradient fractionation after 1% Triton X-100 extraction at 4 °C (Fig. 3B). Flotilin-1, a marker protein of the lipid raft fraction, was detected as Triton X-100-insoluble proteins in fractions 4 and 5 (data not shown). GAP43-NEP as well as wild-type neprilysin were detected in the lipid raft fraction (Fig. 3B). The amount of GAP43-NEP in the raft fraction was 1.3-fold higher, compared with the case of wild-type neprilysin (p < 0.05). We did not employ the raft-targeting strategy described by Cailler et al. (32Cailler F. Howell S. Crine P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1415: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), in which a raft-targeting sequence was added at the C terminus of neprilysin, because such a modification may alter the conformation of the protein and thus may also modify the enzymatic properties of the peptidase. We also investigated whether the expressed proteins appeared on the cell surface or not by performing immunofluorescence in the absence of Triton X-100. Wild-type neprilysin, ST-NEP, TfR-NEP, and GAP43-NEP, but not Sec12-NEP, were observed on the cell surface (data not shown). Effect of Targeting of Neprilysin to Particular Intracellular Compartments on Intracellular and Extracellular Aβ Levels—We measured the amounts of Aβ extracted with guanidine hydrochloride from the primary neurons expressing wild-type neprilysin, inactive mutant neprilysin, and neprilysin chimeric proteins (Fig. 4) in order to assess how much of the endogenously generated intracellular Aβ was degraded. Both Aβ40 and Aβ42 were significantly decreased by the overexpression of wild-type neprilysin but not by that of inactive mutant neprilysin, as reported previously (20Hama E. Shirotani K. Masumoto H. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Aizawa H. Saido T.C. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 721-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All the chimeric proteins degraded Aβ40 to an extent indistinguishable from that of wild-type neprilysin. Aβ42 was much less degraded than Aβ40 in all cases (0–10% versus 50–60%). Our speculation on the reason for the preferential clearance of intracellular Aβ40 as compared with Aβ42 is that Aβ40 may be retained intracellularly for a longer time than Aβ42, for instance through a recycling mechanism. This assumption is supported by the observation that ER-targeted neprilysin degrades Aβ40 as sufficiently as wild type and other chimeras (see “Discussion” for further speculation). Most interesting, only wild-type neprilysin and ST-NEP degraded intracellular Aβ42 to a significant degree. This is presumably because Aβ42 is not generated in or recycled back to the ER (see “Discussion”) and because endosomes are somewhat too acidic for neprilysin, the optimum pH for which is neutral, to more efficiently degrade Aβ than in TGN. We next examined the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the conditioned media of the infected cells (Fig. 5). Overexpression of the wild-type neprilysin, ST-NEP, TfR-NEP, and GAP43-NEP significantly decreased the amounts of extracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42 in a comparable manner (p < 0.01). ST-NEP and TfR-NEP differed from the wild-type neprilysin by clearing Aβ40 in a slightly but significantly less efficient manner (p < 0.01). Again, Aβ42 was cleared to a lesser extent than Aβ40 (∼60 versus 80%), but the difference was smaller than in the case of intracellular Aβ clearance. In contrast, Sec12-NEP, targeted to ER, exhibited much weaker activity to reduce the extracellular Aβ (∼20%). Despite a large number of cell biological studies of Aβ metabolism and transport, it still remains unclear exactly where in neurons Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP). One of the aims of the present study was to obtain a clue to this question by targeting an Aβ-degrading enzyme to particular cellular components. The major technical limitation of our experimental paradigm employed here is that, although we can control the efficiency of infection by altering the amount of the viral vectors, the amount of protein expressed per cell cannot be controlled. This limitation makes it somewhat difficult to interpret the results in a quantitative manner. This assumption probably applies to the overexpression paradigm in most cell biological studies of APP and Aβ metabolism thus far performed. However, because the Aβ clearance in each case, intracellular or extracellular, remained unsaturated (Figs. 4 and 5), the following qualitative considerations should at least be valid. We would like to comment on the difference in the ratio of Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels between the in vitro and in vivo situations. The ratio is ∼7:1 in vitro and 3:1 in vivo (27Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y. Muramatsu S. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Ozawa K. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This difference is presumably due to the difference in the volume of the extracellular space and in the complexity of axo-dendritic structure and connections. Therefore, a simple enzymatic explanation for the observation indicating that Aβ40 was more efficiently degraded than Aβ42 in the present in vitro experimental paradigm (Figs. 4 and 5) is that the affinity of neprilysin for Aβ42 is indistinguishable from that for Aβ40 (26Shirotani K. Tsubuki S. Iwata N. Takaki Y. Harigaya W. Maruyama K. Kiryu-Seo S. Kiyama H. Iwata H. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Saido T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21895-21901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and that the substrate present in a larger amount has a greater chance of encountering the enzyme. In contrast, Aβ40 and Aβ42 are degraded to an essentially identical extent in the brain in vivo as indicated by reverse genetic evidence (4Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Shirotani K. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Hama E. Lee H.J. Saido T.C. Science. 2001; 292: 1550-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Most interesting, infusion of a cell-impermeable neprilysin inhibitor, thiorphan, into the brain elevated Aβ42 but not Aβ40 in the insoluble fraction (33Iwata N. Tsubuki S. Takaki Y. Watanabe K. Sekiguchi M. Hosoki E. Kawashima-Morishima M. Lee H.J. Hama E. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Saido T.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These previous observations, together with the finding that the relative efficiency of Aβ42 degradation versus Aβ40 degradation is greater extracellularly than intracellularly, imply that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are somewhat differentially metabolized in spatial terms. Degradation of Aβ42 seems to be more closely associated with the outside surface of the cell than that of Aβ40. The “outside surface” probably corresponds to the presynaptic membrane in vivo (27Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y. Muramatsu S. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Ozawa K. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Fukami S. Watanabe K. Iwata N. Haraoka J. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Fraser P. Westaway D. St. George-Hyslop P. Saido T.C. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 43: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Among the four chimeric proteins examined in the present study, only Sec12-NEP, targeted to ER, was significantly less abundantly detected than wild-type neprilysin in terms of both protein quantity and enzymatic activity. As discussed under “Results,” this is likely to have been caused by metabolic instability of this chimera, which may be accounted for by premature glycosylation, because Sec12-NEP, but not the others, was sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment (data not shown). Nevertheless, expression of Sec12-NEP reduced intracellular Aβ40 in a manner comparable with that of wild-type neprilysin and the other chimeras. This indicates that the relatively small activity of neprilysin expressed in ER was sufficient to degrade intracellular Aβ40, because wild-type neprilysin and all the other chimeras reside at least transiently in the ER after synthesis. Considering the previous reports describing Aβ generation in ER, TGN, and endosome (14Echeverria V. Cuello A.C. Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 26: 299-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Ling Y.

Snyder E. Gouras G.K. Program No. 667.8. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2003Google Scholar), our observation implies that a certain pool of intracellular Aβ40 is retained in or recycled back to the ER in cultured neurons, as it is unlikely that the ER is a major site of Aβ generation from APP (36Iwata H. Tomita T. Maruyama K. Iwatsubo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21678-21685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). If aging causes such a pool of intracellular Aβ to remain abnormally unmetabolized, pathological intraneuronal Aβ accumulation (37Chui D.H. Tanahashi H. Ozawa K. Ikeda S. Checler F. Ueda O. Suzuki H.

Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) may arise, possibly leading to ER stresses. Part of this ER-resident Aβ may be transported to the cytoplasm and undergo degradation catalyzed by proteosome or insulin-degrading enzyme (40Schmitz A. Schneider A. Kummer M.P. Herzogm V. Traffic. 2004; 5: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the fact that intracellular Aβ42 was cleared significantly only by wild-type neprilysin and TGN-targeted ST-NEP (Fig. 4). This observation is consistent with our speculation that metabolism of Aβ42 takes place somewhat later than that of Aβ40 in the intracellular trafficking processes. In clear contrast to intracellular Aβ, extracellular Aβ was poorly degraded by Sec12-NEP, which did not appear on the cell surface. Because the wild-type neprilysin and all the other chimeras were detected on the outside of neurons, the results indicate that the majority of extracellular Aβ degradation takes place on the cell surface in the present experimental paradigm. It was rather unexpected that GAP43-NEP, targeted to lipid rafts, failed to degrade Aβ more efficiently than wild-type neprilysin, because a number of studies have indicated that Aβ generation takes place in this microdomain (18Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 19Cordy J.M. Hussain I. Dingwall C. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11735-11740Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The results can be accounted for by assuming that the extracellular Aβ was proteolyzed by neprilysin after being secreted into the conditioned medium in the present in vitro paradigm. We would like to draw attention to the fact that that although the ratio of soluble Aβ to insoluble Aβ is ∼400:1 in vitro, the ratio in vivo is 3:1 (27Iwata N. Mizukami H. Shirotani K. Takaki Y. Muramatsu S. Lu B. Gerard N.P. Gerard C. Ozawa K. Saido T.C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Therefore, there still remains a possibility that targeting neprilysin to lipid rafts may improve the efficiency of Aβ degradation under in vivo conditions, in which both neprilysin and Aβ are axonally transported to presynapses (27Iwata N.

The yeast heme-responsive transcriptional activator Hap1 is a native substrate of both Hsp90 and Hsp70. Hsp90 and Hsp70 are critical for the precise regulation of Hap1 activity by heme. Here, to decipher the molecular events underlying the actions of Hsp90 and Hsp70 in heme regulation, we purified various multichaperone-Hap1 complexes and characterized the complexes linked to Hap1 repression and activation by two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis. Notably, we found that in vitro Hap1 is associated continuously with Ssa and its co-chaperones, and this association is not weakened by heme. Heme enhances the interaction between Hap1 and Hsp90. In vivo, defective Ssa, Ydj1, or Sro9 function causes Hap1 derepression in the absence of heme, whereas defective Hsp90 function causes reduced Hap1 activity at high heme concentrations. These results show that continuous association of Hap1 with Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 confers Hap1 repression, whereas enhanced association of Hsp90 with the repressed Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complex by heme causes Hap1 activation.

In particular, the Hsp90 molecular chaperone has been shown to bind and regulate nearly 100 key cellular signal transducers, including transcription factors and protein kinases (for example, steroid receptors, cyclin-dependent kinases, and Src) that control fundamental molecular and cellular processes, which include cell cycle progression, cellular senescence, and apoptosis (7Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The molecular chaperone Hsp70 also plays an indispensable role in the regulation of at least some, if not all, of these Hsp90 substrate proteins, such as steroid receptors and certain kinases (13Johnson J.L.

Hsp90 promotes steroid receptor activation by opening up the steroid-binding cleft and permitting ligand binding and the activation of steroid receptors (7Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol.

Hsp70 may facilitate the formation of the mature Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes that are capable of ligand binding and activation and then exit as in the case of glucocorticoid receptor or remain bound to the substrate protein along with Hsp90 in the activable receptor-Hsp90 complexes as in the case of the progesterone receptor (7Pratt W.B.

These roles of Hsp90 and Hsp70 in heme signaling are different from their roles in steroid signaling (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang L. Mol.

To better understand the molecular basis for the distinct roles of Hsp90 and Ssa in heme regulation, we need to define the chaperone complexes associated with Hap1 repression and activation. Here, by examining various multichaperone-Hap1 complexes by two-dimensional electrophoresis, we found that Hap1 is continuously repressed by binding with Ssa and its co-chaperones Ydj1 and Sro9, whereas Hap1 activation by heme is achieved by enhanced association of the inactive Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complex with Hsp90. These results provide a clear mechanistic description of how Hsp90 and Hsp70 promote heme regulation of Hap1 and may shed light on how they control the activities of many other complex signal transducers.

Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). His6 Pulldown—Yeast cell extracts (∼100 μl, 5-10 mg/ml) prepared from cells expressing high levels of Hap1 (or His6-Hap1) and His6-Ssa1 (or His6-Ydj1, His6-Sro9, or His6-Hsp82) were incubated with 50 μl of Ni-NTA 1The abbreviation used is: Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. beads (Qiagen) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm imidazole. Subsequently, beads were washed extensively with the buffer containing 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted by using buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Eluted proteins from Ni-NTA beads were immediately analyzed by electrophoresis on non-denaturing 3.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.33× Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C by using the ZOOM IPGRunner Cassette electrophoresis apparatus (Invitrogen). In the initial experiments, 100 pmol of synthetic DNA containing a Hap1-binding site was incubated with purified proteins prior to electrophoresis to ensure that the multichaperone-Hap1 complexes could migrate into the gel because of the negative charges of DNA. However, DNA was not found to be necessary for the migration of the protein complexes into the gel and was omitted in subsequent experiments. After the electrophoresis, the gel strips were overlaid on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to electrophoresis in running buffer containing glycine and SDS. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Hap1, Hsp90, Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 were detected by using antibodies against glutathione S-transferase-Hap1 (residues 1-171) (24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), part of Hsp90 (21Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol.

The signals were revealed by using a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA-binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl volume with 5% glycerol, 4 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 ng/μl heme, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 10 μm ZnOAc2, 300 μg/ml bovine serum albumin as described (24Zhang L.

Approximately 0.01 pmol of labeled DNA was used in each reaction. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and then loaded onto 3.5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.33× Tris borate-EDTA for gel electrophoresis at 4 °C. Radioactivity of the interested bands was visualized and quantified using the PhosphorImage™ system (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Pulldown—For DNA pulldown (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7430-7437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), extracts prepared from cells expressing wild-type Hap1 were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Dynal) prebound with the biotinylated DNA containing the high affinity (CGGACTTATCGG) or mutated (CGGACTCATCCG) Hap1-binding site (31Hon T. Hach A. Tamalis D. Zhu Y. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22770-22774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) under the condition described above for electrophoretic mobility shift assays. 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was included in the reaction mixture. The beads were extensively washed and boiled in SDS gel loading buffer to release the bound proteins (32Reddy S.V. Alcantara O. Boldt D.H. Blood. 1998; 91: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting analysis. Hap1 Is Continuously Bound by Ssa and Co-chaperones Ydj1 and Sro9—To define Hap1 complexes responsible for its repression and activation, we purified various Hap1-chaperone complexes and examined their composition. These complexes were purified using His6-tagged proteins that are known to bind to Hap1, including Hsp90, Ydj1, Ssa, Sro9, and Hap1 per se. They were subsequently analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and their components were detected by Western blotting with antibodies to molecular chaperones and Hap1 (Fig. 1A). The first dimension is non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis so that preformed chaperone and Hap1 complexes can be separated but remain intact. The second dimension is denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis so that all proteins can be separated according to their molecular masses. First we analyzed the complexes pulled down by Ni-NTA beads incubated with extracts prepared from cells expressing His6-Ydj1 and a high level of Hap1 from the GAL1 promoter (26Turcotte B. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that one main native complex (Fig. 1A) was pulled down using His6-Ydj1. We detected significant levels of Hap1, Ssa, and Sro9 (Fig. 1A) in the complex, but not Hsp90, by Western blotting with the corresponding antibodies (21Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 33Caplan A.J. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Sobel S.G. Wolin S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3849-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 35Halladay J.T. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4890-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a control, we showed that the lack of a detectable level of Hsp90 was not attributable to low sensitivity of the Hsp90 antibody (Fig. 1B). This result showed that high levels of Hap1, Sro9, Ssa, and Ydj1, but not Hsp90, coexisted in one complex. Similarly, we performed pull-down experiments using extracts prepared from cells expressing high levels of His6-Ssa and Hap1. In this case, two major Ssa complexes were pulled down, and one contained Hap1 (marked by an arrow, Fig. 2A), Sro9, and Ydj1 (not shown), but not Hsp90. The other complex did not contain Hap1 (Fig. 2A). When extracts were prepared from cells expressing His6-Hap1, two Hap1 complexes were pulled down. Both contained Ssa (Fig. 2B) and its co-chaperones, Ydj1 and Sro9 (not shown), but not Hsp90. Given that a previous large scale purification of Hap1 using His6-Hap1 showed that Hsp90 is bound to Hap1 (24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the above results most likely suggest that only a small portion of Hap1 complexes contains Hsp90. Thus Hsp90 is not detected when the purification scale is small; it is not that Hsp90 does not bind to Hap1 at all. To confirm this interpretation, we analyzed complexes pulled down by using extracts prepared from cells expressing a high level of His6-Hsp90. A series of Hsp90 complexes was pulled down (Fig. 2C, αHap1), and at least three (marked by arrows, Fig. 2C) of them contain Hap1 and Ssa and co-chaperones. All complexes containing Hsp90 and Hap1 also contain Ssa and its co-chaperones (Fig. 2). Together, the results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 strongly suggest that all Hap1 is complexed with Ssa and co-chaperones Ydj1 and Sro9, whereas only a small fraction of the Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complex is bound by Hsp90. We examined the in vitro DNA binding activity of the purified (pulled down) complexes containing high levels of Ssa and co-chaperones (Fig. 3A). As expected, these complexes bound to DNA mostly in the form of HMC (Fig. 3A, lane 1), a high molecular weight complex formed in the absence of heme (24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Zhang L. Guarente L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14643-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The HMC binds to DNA with low affinity. The addition of heme disrupted the HMC and allowed Hap1 to bind to DNA with high affinity as DC (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). We also examined the composition of the pulled-down complexes (Fig. 3B). By SDS-PAGE analysis followed by quantification with scanning and NIH Image software, we found that the molar ratio of Hap1 (170 kDa):Ssa (69 kDa):Sro9 (48 kDa) is ∼1:1.5:2.5. Because Hap1 is a preexisting dimer/oligomer in the HMC (31Hon T. Hach A. Tamalis D. Zhu Y. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22770-22774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this result suggests that the purified HMC contains at least two Hap1, three Ssa, and five Sro9 molecules. The intensity of the Ydj1 band was not specific or strong enough for quantification. Heme Enhances the Association of Hsp90 with Hap1—To examine the effect of heme on the Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complexes, we examined chaperone-Hap1 complexes formed in the presence and absence of heme by using purified complexes from extracts prepared from cells expressing high levels of His6-Sro9 and Hap1 (Fig. 4A). The presence of heme altered the mobility of Hap1 complexes (Fig. 4A, see the positions of complexes on the 1st Dimension) as expected, suggesting that heme affects the conformation of Hap1 complexes. Notably, the association of Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 with Hap1 was not affected by heme (Fig. 4A). These results show that Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9, which are responsible for Hap1 repression, remain associated with Hap1 in the presence of heme, although heme altered the conformation of the Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complexes. To reveal how heme may affect the association of Hsp90 with Hap1, we used a previously established DNA pull-down technique. Briefly, extracts prepared from cells expressing high levels of Hap1 from the GAL1 promoter were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads bound by biotinylated DNA containing an optimal high affinity Hap1-binding site (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Hon T. Hach A. Tamalis D. Zhu Y. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22770-22774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of exogenously added heme. Hap1 and associated Hsp90 were subsequently detected by Western blotting with antibodies against Hap1 and Hsp90, respectively (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2) (21Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As a control, streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads bound with a mutated Hap1-binding site, to which Hap1 binds with 20-fold lower affinity (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4) (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 31Hon T. Hach A. Tamalis D. Zhu Y. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22770-22774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Zhang L. Guarente L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2110-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), were incubated with the extracts, and bound proteins were analyzed in parallel. Evidently, heme greatly increased the association of Hsp90 with Hap1 (Fig. 4B, compare lane 2 with lane 1). When the chemiluminescence signal is intensified by extended exposure, the association of Hsp90 with Hap1 is observed in the absence of heme, as shown previously (not shown here) (37Lee H.C. Hon T. Lan C. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5857-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When the mutant Hap1 DNA-binding site was used, only very low levels of Hap1 and Hsp90 were pulled down as expected (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4). In summary, these experiments examining multichaperone-Hap1 complexes revealed three important clues about chaperone-Hap1 interaction. First, all Hap1 is complexed with Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9, whereas only a small portion of Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 is bound by Hsp90. Second, heme does not appear to disrupt the association of Ssa, Ydj1, or Sro9 with Hap1, although the conformation of the Hap1-Ssa-Ydj1-Sro9 complex is altered by heme. Third, heme enhances the association of Hsp90 with Hap1, and Hsp90 and Ssa can coexist in the same Hap1 complexes. In Vivo Functional Effects of Hsp90, Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 Correlate with Their Biochemical Association with Hap1—The above biochemical analyses show that all Hap1 is bound by Ssa and co-chaperones Sro9 and Ydj1, whereas only a small fraction of Hap1 is bound by Hsp90. This suggests that Ssa and co-chaperones bind to and repress Hap1 continuously, whereas Hsp90 transiently associates with Hap1 to promote Hap1 activation. To test this idea, we examined the in vivo functional effects of disrupting Hsp90, Ssa, Ydj1, or Sro9 function on Hap1 activity. As shown in Fig. 5, defective Hsp90 function caused reduced Hap1 activation, whereas defective Ssa, Ydj1, or Sro9 function caused Hap1 derepression in the absence of heme. Specifically, in yeast cells in which Hsp90 is expressed at a low level from a truncated promoter (21Chang H.C. Lindquist S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24983-24988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Hap1 activity was significantly reduced at heme concentrations that permit Hap1 activation (Fig. 5, A and E). In yeast cells (22Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) in which Ssa was expressed at low levels from the GAL1 promoter under partial inducing conditions (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), Hap1 gained high levels of activity in heme-deficient cells, but Hap1 activity at high heme concentrations was not affected (Fig. 5, B and E). In cells in which the YDJ1 (Fig. 5, C and E) or SRO9 (Fig. 5, D and E) gene is deleted, Hap1 gained low levels (but much higher than the basal level) of activity in heme-deficient cells, whereas Hap1 activity at high heme concentrations was not affected. These results show that defective Hsp90 function causes defective Hap1 activation, that defective Ssa function causes virtually full derepression of Hap1 in the absence of heme, and that lack of Ydj1 or Sro9 causes partial derepression of Hap1 in the absence of heme. These in vivo functional data are in complete agreement with the biochemical data suggesting that Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 bind to and repress Hap1 continuously, whereas Hsp90 associates with Hap1 transiently and promotes Hap1 activation. Our biochemical and functional analyses of Hap1 complexes containing Hsp90, Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 provide important insights into how these chaperones promote heme regulation of Hap1 activity. Ssa and co-chaperones Ydj1 and Sro9 appear to bind to Hap1 constantly (Figs. 1 and 2) and are functionally associated with Hap1 repression in the absence of heme (Fig. 5). In contrast, Hsp90 is associated with only a small fraction of Hap1 (Fig. 2). Heme enhances its association with Hap1 in vitro (Fig. 4), and defective Hsp90 function correlates with reduced Hap1 activity at high heme concentrations (Fig. 5). These results suggest a mechanistic model that explains the actions of Hsp90 and Hsp70 (Ssa) and its co-chaperones in promoting heme signaling (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with and can explain all previous functional, biochemical, and genetic data on the roles of Hsp90 and Ssa and co-chaperones in heme signaling (Fig. 6) (18Hon T. Lee H.C.

Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Lee H.C. Hon T. Zhang L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar), we can envision the major steps and molecular complexes mediating the repression of Hap1 and its subsequent activation by heme (Fig. 6). We propose that newly synthesized Hap1 is bound initially and perhaps cotranslationally by Ssa and its co-chaperones Ydj1 and Sro9 (Fig. 6). As a result, a repressed Hap1 complex is formed, and Hap1 is continuously repressed. This is supported by our previous data showing that reduced levels of Ssa cause Hap1 derepression and that lack of Ydj1 or Sro9 function causes partial Hap1 derepression (18Hon T. Lee H.C. Hach A. Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and by previous studies showing the roles of Ssa and Ydj1 in protein folding (1Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 2Shao J. Grammatikakis N. Scroggins B.T. Uma S. Huang W. Chen J.J. Hartson S.D. Matts R.L. J.

A. 1998; 95: 15223-15228Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the idea that Hap1, as a transcriptional activator, needs to be continuously repressed except when activated transiently and that constitutively active Hap1 is toxic to yeast cells (24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Hach A. Hon T. Zhang L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4324-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hsp90 may associate only transiently with Hap1, and the association would cause Hap1 to be activated or activable. When heme concentration increases, heme enhances the interaction of Hsp90 with Hap1 and binds to Hap1, causing conformational changes in the multichaperone-Hap1 complex and leading to Hap1 activation (Fig. 6). The association of Hsp90 with Hap1 is clearly necessary for full Hap1 activation in vivo (Fig. 5A), and heme enhances Hap1-Hsp90 interaction (Fig. 4B). However, high Hap1 DNA binding affinity in vitro did not appear to require high levels of Hsp90 because Hap1 DNA binding activity was significantly increased by heme addition (Fig. 3A) in reaction mixtures that contain no additional source of Hsp90 except that source pulled down by Ni-NTA beads. It is likely that the DNA-Hap1 complexes detected by DNA pulldown in the presence of heme (Fig. 4B) contain only substoichiometric levels of Hsp90. Even in the presence of heme in reaction mixtures containing abundant Hsp90 from whole cell extracts (Fig. 4B), the level of Hsp90 bound to Hap1 might be quite low compared with that of Hap1 because the signals from anti-Hsp90 antibodies were generally much stronger than those from anti-Hap1 antibodies (Fig. 1B). As a positive modulator for Hap1, it is perhaps advantageous to have the association of Hsp90 with the Hap1 complex be transient, dynamic, and substoichiometric so that Hap1 activation is readily reversible and highly responsive to changes of heme concentration. The model shown in Fig. 6 represents a novel mode of action by which Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperones act to promote signal transduction. Thus far, the most well studied mechanism of Hsp90 action is that involved in steroid signaling (7Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Exp. Biol.

Steroid receptor complexes purified from cell lysates or mature complexes reconstituted in vitro contain high levels of Hsp90 but little or substoichiometric levels of Hsp70, although Hsp70 is essential for the formation of Hsp90-steroid receptor complexes capable of ligand binding and activation (3Hernandez M.P.

It is postulated that Hsp90 plays a dual role in the repression of steroid receptors and ligand binding and the activation of receptors (8Picard D. Freedman L.P.

Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Both biochemical and functional studies support such a dual role of Hsp90 in the regulation of steroid receptors (8Picard D. Freedman L.P. Molecular Biology of Steroid and Nuclear Hormone Receptors.

In contrast, here we show that the majority of Hap1 is complexed with Ssa (Hsp70), Ydj1, and Sro9, which cause its repression. Only a low level of Hsp90 is associated with Hap1, although the association is enhanced by heme. These results provide a molecular explanation for the separate roles of Hsp90 and Ssa and co-chaperones in Hap1 activation and repression, respectively, in a two-tier pathway. Notably, contrary to its role in steroid signaling, Hsp90 does not play a role in Hap1 repression but only in Hap1 activation. Indeed, in vivo transient or sustained inhibition of Hsp90 function has never been shown to cause Hap1 activation, whereas defective Ssa function causes Hap1 derepression (19Lee H.C. Hon T. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7430-7437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Zhang L. Hach A. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3819-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 2H. C. Lee and L. Zhang, unpublished results. Although the roles of Hsp90 and Hsp70 in steroid signaling and heme signaling appear to be reversed, the assembly of Hap1- and steroid receptor-multichaperone complexes is analogous in that both Hap1 and steroid receptors become associated first with Hsp70 and then with Hsp90. This is consistent with the well demonstrated roles of Ssa (Hsp70) in the folding of nascent proteins (4Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. Cell. 1997; 90: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar). However, why is Hsp70 needed as a permanent association partner of Hap1 but not of steroid receptors? One possible explanation is that Hap1 is a very complex protein (1483 amino acid residues) with many modules and domains (41Zhang L. Hach A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As a result, Hap1 may need to be constantly bound by Hsp70 and co-chaperones to be properly folded and repressed, whereas steroid receptors, once folded, may be able to maintain their properly folded state in the absence of Hsp70. Notably, the association of Ssa, Ydj1, and Sro9 is not disrupted even upon heme activation, further supporting the idea that Ssa and co-chaperones are continuously required for the function of Hap1. The continued association of the repressive Ssa and co-chaperones with activated Hap1 is not paradoxical. Such continued association with the repressor protein also occurs in the activation of the yeast activator Gal4. The repressor Gal80 still associates with Gal4 even when Gal4 is activated (42Platt A. Reece R.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4086-4091Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 43Leuther K.K. Johnston S.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1333-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another intriguing aspect of Hap1-multichaperone system is that the association of Hap1 and Hsp90 is enhanced by heme. Hsp90 may play a coactivator role in Hap1-mediated transcriptional activation. This effect of ligand on substrate-Hsp90 interaction has not been previously observed. The alteration of the strength of Hsp90-substrate interaction by ligand provides another potential mechanism for the regulation of Hsp90 substrates. This mechanism of Hap1 folding and repression by Ssa (Hsp70) and co-chaperones and activation by Hsp90 and heme may also operate to preserve and control the activities of numerous other complex proteins, including the heme-regulated kinase HRI (2Shao J.

The interaction between HscA and IscU is facilitated by HscB (also designated Hsc20), a J-type co-chaperone protein that binds both IscU and HscA and targets IscU to HscA (3Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J.

Recently, we found that HscA specifically recognizes a conserved LPPVK sequence motif found at positions 99–103 of IscU (12Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

A synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 98–106 (ELPPVKIHC) was found to bind to HscA and to stimulate HscA ATPase activity in a manner similar to IscU, suggesting that the LPPVK region plays a key role in binding to and regulation of HscA. Amino acid replacement studies on IscU and the Glu98–Cys106 peptide 11 The abbreviations used are: Glu98–Cys106 peptide, ELPPVKIHC peptide corresponding to IscU residues 98–106; HscA(Q421C)-bimane, HscA(D422C)-bimane, and HscA(A455C)-bimane, bimane-labeled HscA triple mutants derived from HscA(C315S/C448S); W-97 peptide, WELPPVKI; W-105 peptide, ELPPVKIW. revealed that Pro101 is the most critical position with Val102 and Lys103 also contributing to high affinity binding and regulation (13Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37582-37589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To better understand the interaction of IscU with HscA we used the crystal structure of DnaK bound to the synthetic peptide NRLLLTG (14Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) to construct models of HscA-peptide complexes (13Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37582-37589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These models suggested that the LPPVK region of IscU could be accommodated in the peptide binding cleft of the substrate binding domain of HscA with the peptide backbone in an extended conformation, and the importance of Pro101 could be rationalized by its projection into a hydrophobic pocket in the central position of the cleft. It was not possible, however, to determine the orientation of the peptide based on model analysis, only minor differences in HscA or peptide structure were observed in models in which the peptide was oriented in opposite directions relative to the substrate binding domain (13Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37582-37589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions of HscA with other regions of the IscU protein or with the co-chaperone HscB could impose steric constraints on binding and dictate orientation of the peptide in the complex. In the studies described herein, we have employed site-directed fluorescence labeling and quenching to determine whether HscA binds to IscU-based peptides and the full-length IscU protein in a specific orientation. The results suggest that HscA has a strong directional preference for substrate binding and that the preferred orientation is opposite that previously reported for peptide complexes of other hsp70 proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Site-directed mutants of HscA and IscU were constructed using the QuikChange technique (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Laragen, Inc). The plasmid pTrcHscA(C315S/C448S) was constructed from pTrcHscA (3Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) by mutation of codons for residues Cys315 and Cys448 to encode serine. This plasmid was used as a template to construct the HscA(Q421C), HscA(D422C), and HscA(A455C) mutants such that each would have a single cysteine codon. pTrcIscU (8Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J.

Concentrations of Glu98–Cys106 were determined using Ellman's reagent (15Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar), and concentrations of W-97 and W-105 were determined assuming ϵ280 = 5,600 m-1 cm-1 for tryptophan (16Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

Bimane Labeling—HscA(Q421C), HscA(D422C), and HscA(A455C) were treated with a 10-fold molar excess of monobromobimane (Molecular Probes) in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 25 °C and then overnight at 4 °C, and excess label was removed using G-25 spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling was assessed spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: HscA ϵ280 = 19,600 m-1 cm-1 (3Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); bimane ϵ280 = 3,600 m-1 cm-1, ϵ380 = 5,000 m-1 cm-1 (19Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L. Biochemsitry. 1999; 38: 16383-16393Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The cysteine-free mutant, HscA(C315S/C448S), gave a labeling stoichiometry <0.1:1 indicating a low level of nonspecific label incorporation. The HscA(Q421C), HscA(D422C), and HscA(A455C) mutants gave labeling stoichiometries ≅1:1 (range 0.65–1.1:1 in different experiments) consistent with specific labeling of the single cysteine residue present. Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a SLM 8100 steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (Jobin Yvon). All measurements were recorded at 25 °C using a 4 × 10-mm cuvette. Samples contained bimane-labeled HscA (1–2 μm) in HKM buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). For experiments in the presence of ADP (1 mm) samples were preincubated 30 min to allow hydrolysis of small amounts of contaminating ATP. For experiments in the presence of ATP (5 mm) the slow intrinsic rate of hydrolysis was estimated to reduce ATP concentrations <2% during the time required for measurements. Corrected emission spectra (4-nm band pass) were recorded from 420 to 520 nm at 1-nm intervals using an excitation wave-length of 395 nm (8-nm band pass) and a scan rate of 1 nm/s. Spectral scans were repeated to test for time-dependent effects, and all samples were found to exhibit rapid equilibration. Peptide titrations were carried out by stepwise additions (1.5–130 μl) from 0.6, 3.0, or 5.7 mm stock solutions in HKM buffer. IscU titrations were carried out by stepwise additions (2.5–60 μl) of 1 mm stock solutions in HKM buffer. For experiments in the presence of HscB, emission spectra of bimane-labeled HscA were recorded in the presence of 5 mm ATP before and after the addition of a pre-equilibrated solution of HscB and IscU (each 57 μm final concentration) in HKM buffer. Emission data were integrated by taking the sum of emission intensities from 420 to 520 nm.

This approach takes advantage of the short-range quenching of bimane fluorescence by tryptophan, a process that involves collisional contact between the bimane excited state and the indole ring of tryptophan (22Sato E.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bimane fluorescence displays some variation with environmental parameters (19Mansoor S.E. Mchaourab H.S. Farrens D.L.

Farrens D.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The substrate binding domain of HscA was selectively labeled with monobromobimane, and the ability of IscU-derived peptides having tryptophan at the N or C terminus (W-97 and W-105) to quench bimane fluorescence was measured. Mutant forms of the full-length IscU protein having tryptophan in the corresponding positions (L97W and H105W) were also tested for their ability to quench bimane-labeled HscA. We have recently constructed models of the substrate binding domain of HscA bound to the IscU peptide ELPPVKI (13Hoff K.G. Cupp-Vickery J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The β-sandwich subdomain of HscA exhibits 50% sequence identity to that of DnaK, suggesting that the peptide binding regions are likely to have similar structures. Fig. 2 shows different views of a model of the HscA substrate binding domain complexed with peptide. The peptide is located in a groove in the β-sandwich subdomain with Pro101 projecting downward into a hydrophobic pocket in the central region of the cleft. In this model the peptide is positioned with the N terminus (Glu98) located on the “back” side of the substrate binding domain and the C terminus (Ile104) located on the “front” side. This orientation is opposite that observed for the DnaK-NRLLLTG peptide complex (14Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). We have designated the back to front orientation shown as the “reverse” direction relative to the “forward” direction originally observed for the DnaK-NRLLLTG peptide complex. To identify positions for bimane labeling we inspected the model for surface residues close to the position at which the peptide exits the binding cleft. Gln421 and Asp422, located just below the cleft on the front side, and Ala455, located just below the cleft on the back side, appeared to provide labeling sites that might allow bimane to selectively interact with N- or C-terminal residues of bound peptides. Cysteine Mutants of HscA—Cysteine residues were introduced into HscA at positions 421, 422, or 455 to allow bimane labeling. To ensure specific labeling at these sites the endogenous cysteine residues at positions 315 and 448 of HscA were first changed to serine by mutagenesis. This resulting double mutant, HscA(C315S/C448S), was then used as a template to generate three triple mutants, designated HscA(Q421C), HscA(D422C), and HscA(A455C), containing unique cysteine labeling sites. Each of the mutants behaved similarly to wild-type HscA during purification, suggesting that no gross structural changes resulted from the amino acid replacements. To assess whether the different cysteine substitutions affected functional properties of the proteins, each mutant was assayed for ATPase and chaperone activity as well as for interactions with peptides and IscU. Table I shows the ATPase activity of wild-type HscA, HscA(Q421C), HscA(D422C), and HscA(A455C) in the absence and presence of the different peptides and forms of IscU. The parent HscA(C315S/C448S) mutant displayed an elevated basal ATPase activity compared with wild-type HscA (0.46 versus 0.10 min-1), and a similar increase was observed for the three site-specific cysteine mutants (0.37–0.80 min-1). Each of the mutants exhibited peptide and IscU-stimulated ATPase activity indicating retention of allosteric coupling of ATPase activity with substrate binding. Synergistic stimulation by IscU in the presence of HscB (8Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was also observed indicating that the coupling between substrate and co-chaperone activation was not altered. The effects of the cysteine substitutions on the affinity for IscU were further assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry, and each of the mutants bound IscU with an affinity comparable with that of wild-type HscA: HscA Kd = 3.0 μm, HscA(Q421C) Kd = 2.9 μm, HscA(D422C) Kd = 1.0 μm, and HscA(A455C) Kd = 9.4 μm. All mutants also displayed chaperone activity similar to that of wild-type HscA (20Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as assessed by suppression of aggregation of the model substrate rhodanese (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that HscA(Q421C), HscA(422C), and HscA(455C) represent active HscA mutants without major alterations in their functional properties. Peptide Quenching of Bimane-labeled HscA—The HscA cysteine mutants were labeled with bimane, and initial studies on their interactions with peptides were carried out in the absence of nucleotides. Fig. 3 shows the effects of the wild-type Glu98–Cys108 peptide and the tryptophan containing W-97 and W-105 peptides on the bimane fluorescence emission of both front- and back-labeled HscA. For the front-labeled HscA(D422C)-bimane derivative the Glu98–Cys106 and W-97 peptides gave only weak quenching (≅6%), whereas the W-105 peptide quenched bimane fluorescence ≅21%. The enhanced quenching by W-105 relative to W-97 suggests that the bound peptide is preferentially oriented with the C terminus on the front face of the substrate binding domain proximal to residue 422 (see Fig. 2). The difference in quenching efficiency of W-97 and W-105 indicates that >90% of the peptide is bound in this reverse (back to front) orientation. The effects of the peptides on the fluorescence of the back-labeled HscA(A455C)-bimane mutant were also consistent with preferential binding orientation. For this derivative there was substantial quenching (≅29%) of bimane fluorescence by the Glu98–Cys108 peptide, suggesting that peptide binding itself alters the emission efficiency of the probe at position 455. However, a large difference in quenching efficiency was observed with the tryptophan-labeled peptides. The W-105 peptide produced only marginally greater quenching than Glu98–Cys106 (31 versus 29%), whereas the W-97 peptide was much more effective (≅68%). These results indicate a strong preference (>10:1) for peptide binding in which the N terminus is located on the back side of the substrate binding domain, i.e. the same reverse orientation as observed with the HscA(D422C)-bimane derivative. Whereas it is possible that the failure of specific peptides to quench fluorescence could result from restricted positioning of the tryptophan residue, the agreement of the findings with front- and back-labeled HscA-bimane derivatives argues in favor of a single preferred orientation. The binding affinity of the peptides for the HscA-bimane derivatives was analyzed by integration of the emission curves in Fig. 3 at each concentration of added peptide (Fig. 4). For bimane-labeled HscA(D422C) the extent of quenching by Glu98–Cys106 and W-97 was too low to analyze with confidence, but the data show an approximate fit to a binding curve corresponding to Kd ∼30 μm. Data for the W-105 peptide fit a curve corresponding to Kd ≅10 μm. For bimane-labeled HscA(A455C) each of the peptides displayed a normal saturation curve and bound with similar affinity, Kd ≅ 20 μm. The similarities of the affinities of the W-97 and W-105 peptides to that of Glu98–Cys106 suggest that the presence of tryptophan at the N or C terminus does not dramatically alter binding interactions. The lack of a major effect of the terminal tryptophan residues on binding affinity is consistent with the HscA-peptide model in which residues 97 and 105 are positioned outside of the immediate peptide binding cleft (see Fig. 2). Similar fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out using the HscA(Q421C)-bimane derivative (see Supplemental Materials Fig. 1). As with HscA(D422C)-bimane the Glu98–Cys106 and W-97 peptides had weaker effects (maximal quenching <16%) than the W-105 peptide (≅38% maximal quenching). The finding that similar results are obtained using a different front side labeling position provide additional support for the preferential back to front binding orientation.

To determine whether the bimane-labeled HscA mutants retain this allosteric coupling we monitored peptide-induced quenching in the presence of ADP or ATP. As shown in Fig. 5 binding of W-105 to bimane-labeled HscA(D422C) and W-97 to bimane-labeled HscA(A455C) is nucleotide-dependent. The affinity of HscA(D422C)-bimane for W-105 is ≅17-fold lower in the presence of ATP than in the presence of ADP, and the affinity of HscA(A455C)-bimane for W-97 is reduced ≅6-fold in the presence of ATP compared with the ADP-bound state. In both cases the affinities observed in the presence of ADP are similar to those observed in the absence of nucleotide (compare Fig. 4). These results indicate that neither the mutations introduced in HscA(C315S, C448S, and D422C, or A455C) nor the presence of the bimane probe impair interdomain communication. Quenching by IscU Mutants—To determine whether the preferential binding orientation observed with the W-97 and W-105 peptides occurred with the full-length IscU protein we prepared the corresponding IscU(L97W) and IscU(H105W) mutant proteins.

ColQ subunits, differing mostly by their signal sequences, are encoded by transcripts ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a, which are differentially expressed in slow and fast twitch muscles in mammals. Two distinct promoters, pColQ-1 and pColQ-1a, were isolated from the upstream sequences of human COLQ gene; they showed muscle-specific expression and were activated by myogenic transcriptional elements in cultured myotubes. After in vivo DNA transfection, pColQ-1 showed strong activity in slow twitch muscle (e.g. soleus), whereas pColQ-1a was preferably expressed in fast twitch muscle (e.g. tibialis). Mutation analysis of the ColQ promoters suggested that the muscle fiber type-specific expression pattern of ColQ transcripts were regulated by a slow upsteam regulatory element (SURE) and a fast intronic regulatory element (FIRE). These regulatory elements were responsive to a calcium ionophore and to calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporine A. The slow fiber type-specific expression of ColQ-1 was abolished by the mutation of an NFAT element in pColQ-1.

A single ACHE gene produces several types of catalytic subunits by alternative splicing, but a single splice variant called type T (AChET) is expressed in adult mammalian muscles. AChET catalytic subunits produce amphiphilic monomers and dimers and nonamphiphilic homotetramers as well as heteromeric associations with anchoring proteins, ColQ and PRiMA, which allow their functional localization in cholinergic synapses (2Massoulié J.

The primary structure of ColQ comprises a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain containing a proline-rich motif (PRAD) that associates with four C-terminal T peptides of AChET or butyrylcholinesterase subunits, a collagenous domain with characteristic repeats of glycines every three residues, and a C-terminal region (10Bon S.

In rodents the expression and distribution of AChE forms in muscles depend on age, on the fast or slow type of muscle, on the contact with the motor nerve, and on contractile activity (1Massoulié J.

In rat, the appearance of collagen-tailed forms coincides with the establishment of nerve-muscle contacts (12Sketelj J. Brzin M. J. Neurosci.

In addition, the composition and the distribution of these molecules differ between fast and slow muscles, which vary with activity (12Sketelj J. Brzin M. J. Neurosci.

In slow muscles, the A8 and A4 forms are relatively abundant, and they are found in extra-junctional regions of muscle fibers (12Sketelj J. Brzin M. J. Neurosci.

These differences can be explained by the distribution of AChE and ColQ transcripts in junctional and extra-junctional regions of the muscles (20Çresnar B. Çrne-Finderle N. Breskvar K. Sketelj J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); ColQ is only expressed at the nmjs in fast twitch muscles, but it is uniformly expressed in extra-junctional and junctional regions of slow twitch muscles (21Krejci E. Legay C. Thomine S. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10672-10679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human and rat the COLQ gene (∼50 kb in length) possesses two origins of transcription located ∼23 kb apart, generating alternative exons 1 and 1a which are followed by 17 constitutive exons (21Krejci E.

Exon 1 and exon 1a encode essentially the signal peptides so that the mature ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a subunits possess nearly identical sequences, in particular the PRAD. In rat muscles, the ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a transcripts are expressed differentially in slow and fast twitch muscles. To understand the regulation of collagen-tailed AChE at the nmjs, we analyzed the factors that control transcription of the COLQ gene in slow and fast muscles; we show that the two independent promoters preferentially drive the expression of ColQ-1 transcript in slow muscle and of ColQ-1a in fast muscle. We find that the fiber type-specific expression patterns of ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a are controlled by specific transcription elements, which strongly resemble those previously identified in promoters of other muscle proteins (23Chin E.R.

In addition, we identified elements that control the synapse-specific expression of ColQ.

Deletion of the SURE region in the ColQ-1 promoter was performed with primers 5′-AA GAA TTC GTT TCT GCC CAG TTC C-3′ (-486 to -471) and 5′-AA GAA TTC ACC TTT TGA TTC AAT GCA AG-3′ (-687 to -706) to form pColQ-1ΔSURE-Luc, and deletion of the FIRE region in the ColQ-1a promoter was performed with primers 5′-AA CTC GAG GGC TGC CTA CCC ATT-3′ (-209 to -195) and 5′-AA CTC GAG TGC TCT GGT AAG CCT CAA AG-3′ (-410 to -429) to form pColQ-1aΔFIRE-Luc. The minimum regions corresponding to SURE of rat troponin I slow isoform promoter and FIRE from quail troponin I fast isoform promoter were generated by PCR according to published sequences (30Nakayama M. Stauffer J. Cheng J. Banerjee-Basu S. Wawrousek E. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell.

The SURE region from ColQ-1 promoter was obtained by PCR using the primers 5′-AA GGT ACC TGC AGC TTT TGG AGA GAG-3′ (-686 to -669) and 5′-AA AGA TCT AAC TCT CCT GAT TCA AAC TG-3′ (-487 to -506), and the FIRE region from ColQ-1a promoter was obtained by PCR with primers 5′-AA GGT ACC GTC AAT ACT GCT GTG GTA-3′ (-525 to -508) and 5′-AA AGA TCT CTG CTC CAG CTG CCC-3′ (-340 to -326); these SURE/FIRE regions were subcloned into pTA-Luc to form pSUREColQ-1-Luc and pFIREColQ-1a-Luc, respectively. Mouse ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a cDNAs including exon 1 and 1a were generated from the published sequences (8Krejci E. Thomine S. Boschetti N. Legay C. Sketelji J. Massoulié J. J. Biol.

All cloned sequences were verified before the use. Vectors expressing the luciferase reporter either constitutively under a SV40 promoter (pSV40-Luc) or driven by NFAT elements (p3x(NFAT)-Luc) and expressing wild type Raf-1 (RafWT) and constitutively active Raf (RafCAAX) were purchased from BD Biosciences Clontech. Myogenin cDNA and luciferase reporter for E-box element (p4xRE-Luc) were described previously (27Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol.

Staple J. Adams L. Gnegy M. Chahine K. Goldman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19447-19456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern Blots—Total RNA was prepared by the LiCl method (29Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 6.4-6.11Google Scholar) from myotubes. RT-PCR was used to amplify regions flanking mouse ColQ exon 1 (sense primer, 5′-GGT GGT CCT GAA TCC AAT G-3′) and exon 1a (sense primer, 5′-CTT CTC CTC ATC ATT TCG G-3′) to common exon 3 (antisense primer, 5′-GAA GGT TCT TCA TGT CTG G-3′), with sizes of ∼245 bp for exon 1-exon 3 and ∼191 bp for exon 1a-exon 3, and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-AAC GGA TTT GGC CGT ATT GG-3′ and 5′-CTT CCC GTT CAG CTC TGG G-3′), with size ∼650 bp. All methods for northern blotting were described by Siow et al. (27Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), with detection by a ∼1.4-kb mouse ColQ subunit cDNA 32P-labeled probe (generated by RT-PCR from known sequence) and a ∼1.8-kb probe corresponding to mouse AChE catalytic subunit (27Siow N.L.

Samples of 20 μg of RNA were loaded per gel lane. The consistency of the RNA loading in every lane was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining of the ribosomal RNAs. Ethidium bromide-labeled and 32P-labeled bands were quantified using calibration curves from the same gel (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis of NFAT Binding Site—The NFAT binding site was mutated by using overlapping PCR with mutagenic primers (32Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W.M. Ling K.K.Y. Tung E.K.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overlapping PCR was performed with two PCR fragments containing six nucleotides to be mutated (in bold). The first fragment was developed using primers 5′-AA CCC GGG AAA ATT CAT ATT CTG ACA CC and 5′-AGG AAG GAA GTA GTT TAT GAA TTC AAA CAG CTT TCT CTG TGA AAA A-3′; the second fragment was developed using primers 5′-TTT TTC ACA GAG AAA GCT GTT TGA ATT CAT AAA CTA CTT CCT TCC T-3′ and 5′-AA AGA TCT TGG ATT CAG GAC AAC CAT GC-3′ to give pColQ-1ΔNFAT-Luc. Intramuscular DNA Injection—Intramuscular DNA injection was performed according to the method described by Gramolini et al. (34Gramolini A.O. Bélanger G. Thompson J.M. Chakkalakal J.V. Jasmin B.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 1300-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μg of luciferase-reporter plasmid and 50 μg of CMV promoter-driven β-galactosidase plasmid in 100 μl of 0.9% NaCl was used in each injection. The SV40-driven luciferase, pSV40-Luc, was a control plasmid. The DNAs were intramuscularly injected into the soleus or tibialis muscles of anesthetized 2-month-old SD rats. Rats were from the Animal Care Facility at HKUST. All procedures conformed to the Guidelines of the Animal Research Panel of HKUST for the use and care of laboratory animals in research. A week after injection, the muscles were collected and homogenized (4 ml of ice-cold luciferase lysis buffer/g of tissue) using a Polytron homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T25; Labortecknik) 3 times at 24,000 rpm for 1 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays. cDNA Transfection and Drug Treatment—The purified DNAs encoding various constructs were purified by Maxiprep DNA purification columns (BD Biosciences Clontech), and they were transfected into cultured C2C12 myoblasts or chick myotubes by LipofectAMINE Plus transfection (Invitrogen). G418-resistant stable cell lines were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin) and used in analysis of expression profile during myogenic differentiation. For drug treatments myoblasts were transfected as above, allowed to fuse to myotubes, and treated with cyclosporin A (CsA; Calbiochem), Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (Sigma), recombinant neuregulin (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), or 2-MeSADP (Sigma) for 2 days. For treatment of cultured myotubes with 2-MeSADP, we took care to eliminate free ATP/ADP from the cultures, as described previously (32Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W.M. Ling K.K.Y. Tung E.K.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were collected to perform luciferase, β-galactosidase, and protein assays. Gel Mobility Shift Assay—A nuclear extract of C2C12 myotubes was prepared and used to perform gel shift assay as described by Choi et al. (32Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W.M. Ling K.K.Y. Tung E.K.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear extract (2–5 μg of protein plus 2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) per sample) was preincubated in binding buffer containing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were further incubated for 20 min with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (20-mers; 0.1 pmol) carrying the control NFAT binding site (NFATCon, is underlined) that was synthesized according to the elements found in the promoters of troponin I and myoglobin (23Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar), 5′-GGC GTG GAG GAA AAA CTG TT-3′ and 5′-CCG CAC CTC CTT TTT GAC AA-3′, the NFAT site of the ColQ-1 promoter (NFATColQ-1, underlined), 5′-AAA AAA TTG GAA ATA TAA AA-3′ and 5′-TTT TTT AAC CTT TAT ATT TT-3′ (-642 to -630), and the mutated NFAT site (ΔNFATColQ-1, underlined), 5′-AAA AAA TTG AAT TCA TAA AA-3′ and 5′-TTT TTT AAC TTA AGT ATT TT-3′ (-642 to -630). To obtain a supershift the samples were incubated with an anti-NFATc1 antibody (Santa Cruz, with 1:100 dilution) in binding buffer for 20 min before the addition of the radioactive probe. Finally, the reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Sucrose Density Gradients—Separation of various molecular forms of AChE was performed by sucrose density gradient analysis, as previously described (3Tsim K.W.K. Randall W.R. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1262-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sucrose gradients (5–20%) were prepared on a 0.5-ml cushion of 60% sucrose in 12-ml polyallomer tubes. Sucrose gradients were in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 m NaCl. Cell extract (∼0.1 ml) was loaded onto the gradient. Centrifugation was run for 16 h at 38,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH 641 rotor at 4 °C. Sedimentation markers (catalase, 11.4 S; β-galactosidase, 16 S) were used for calibration of the gradient. About 40 fractions were collected for the determination of AChE enzymatic activity. Other Assays—For Western blot analysis proteins were extracted from cultures and tissues by homogenization; protein (20 μg) was used to perform SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (32Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W.M. Ling K.K.Y. Tung E.K.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ECL detection was carried out according to the manufacturer. Anti-troponin I slow isoform and fast isoform antibodies (1:500) were from Santa Cruz (Delaware Avenue, CA); anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:5,000) was from Sigma. Protein concentrations were measured routinely by the Bradford method (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) with a kit from Bio-Rad. Luciferase assay was performed with a commercial kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). In brief, cell cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). 30 μl of lysate per sample were used in luciferase assay. The luminescent reaction was quantified in a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer, and the activity was expressed as absorbance (up to 560 nm) per mg of protein. The activity of AChE was assayed in medium containing 0.1 mm tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide (iso-OMPA) as an inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (36Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres Jr., V. Feather-Stone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity in the same amount of protein in each sample. Statistical tests were made by the PRIMER program; differences from basal or control values (as shown in the plots) were classified as highly significant (**) where p < 0.001. Two Distinct Promoters Drive the Differential Expression of ColQ Transcripts—The human COLQ gene produces two transcripts (ColQ-1 and ColQ-1a) from two distinct initiation sites; these transcripts differ by their first exons (exons 1 and 1a), which only encode signal sequences of the corresponding ColQ variants (21Krejci E. Legay C. Thomine S. Sketelj J. Massoulié J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10672-10679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Ohno K. Brengman J. Tsujino A. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9654-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The distance between these two transcripts (∼23 kb) and the fact that their expressions differ in their tissue dependence suggest that they are driven from two distinct promoters. To analyze the regulation of ColQ expression, ∼2-kb sequences upstream of the ATG initiation codons of exon 1 and exon 1a were cloned from human genomic DNA using appropriate primers (Fig. 1A). The length of ColQ promoters was arbitrarily chosen to include putative N-box elements. These DNAs were sequenced and showed no difference from those of the corresponding regions of the COLQ gene deposited in GenBank™. The upstream sequences of exon 1 and 1a were subcloned into pGL3 vectors upstream of a luciferase reporter, generating constructs pColQ-1-Luc and pColQ-1a-Luc, respectively (Fig. 1B). Sequence analysis indicated no sequence similarity between the upstream sequences of exon 1 and 1a. We identified consensus sequences for transcriptional factors E-box, NFAT, c-Ets, Elk-1, N-box, and MEF2, which are known to play a role in muscle-specific transcriptional activity (Fig. 1B). In addition, sequence alignment of these identified motifs with the known gene of troponin I revealed putative SURE and FIRE motifs in pColQ-1 and pColQ-1a, respectively. The promoter activities of pColQ-1-Luc and pColQ-1a-Luc were tested in transfected cells. In non-muscle cells, the promoter-driven luciferase activity was as low as that obtained with a pGL3 control construct. In contrast, luciferase was robustly expressed in mouse C2C12 and chick myotubes with either pColQ-1-Luc or pColQ-1a-Luc (Fig. 2A). In addition, the promoter activity was significantly higher for pColQ-1 than for pColQ-1a in the transfected myotubes, particularly in C2C12 myotubes. The differential expression of ColQ promoters in the myotubes could be due to the fiber type of the muscle cultures. Fig. 2B shows a Western blot indicating the levels of slow and fast isoforms of troponin I in rat soleus (a mostly slow muscle), tibialis (a mostly fast muscle), C2C12 myotubes, and chick C2C12 myotubes, expressed predominantly in the slow isoform of troponin I (∼21 kDa), whereas chick myotube expressed both fast and slow isoforms at equal levels. Thus, C2C12 myotubes can be considered to be predominantly of the slow twitch mu"

The activity of NADPH oxidase is dependent on FAD, but the physiological status of FAD in the oxidase is not fully elucidated. To clarify the role of FAD in NADPH oxidase, FAD-free full-length recombinant p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and Rac were prepared, and the activity was reconstituted with these proteins and purified cytochrome b558 (cyt b558) with different amounts of FAD. A remarkably high activity, over 100 μmol/s/μmol heme, was obtained in the oxidase with purified cyt b558, ternary complex (p47-p67-p40phox), and Rac. From titration with FAD of the activity of NADPH oxidase reconstituted with purified FAD-devoid cyt b, the dissociation constant Kd of FAD in cyt b558 of reconstituted oxidase was estimated as nearly 1 nm. We also examined addition of FAD on the assembly process in reconstituted oxidase. The activity was remarkably enhanced when FAD was present during assembly process, and the efficacy of incorporating FAD into the vacant FAD site in purified cyt b558 increased, compared when FAD was added after assembly processes. The absorption spectra of reconstituted oxidase under anaerobiosis showed that incorporation of FAD into cyt b558 recovered electron flow from NADPH to heme. From both Kd values of FAD and the amount of incorporated FAD in cyt b558 of reconstituted oxidase, in combination with spectra, we propose the model in which the Kd values of FAD in cyt b558 is changeable after activation and FAD binding works as a switch to regulate electron transfer in NADPH oxidase.

The phagocyte NADPH oxidase catalyzes the generation of superoxide anions (⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙−) in response to invading microorganisms. Superoxide anions are precursors of a variety of reactive oxygen species that are utilized in killing bacterial and fungal pathogens (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lambeth J.D. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 427-439Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase in host defense is illustrated by the severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections that occur in patients with chronic granulomatous disease whose phagocytes are unable to generate ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− (3Segal B.H.

This NADPH oxidase complex consists of membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558, a heterodimer composed of gp91phox and p22phox, four cytosolic proteins, p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac. In the resting cells, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox exist as a heterotrimeric complex that contains one copy of each protein (5Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Activation of the oxidase is initiated by phosphorylation, which might induce the conformational changes by modulating intra- and intermolecular interactions in the p47-p67-p40phox complex. With these interactions, the activated oxidase is formed via assembly of the cytosolic regulatory proteins with cyt b558. 1The abbreviations used are: cyt b558, cytochrome b558; HTG, N-heptyl-β-thioglucoside; TC, ternary complex of recombinant cytosolic proteins p47-p67-p40phox; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; SH3, Src homolog 3; gp, glycoprotein.1The abbreviations used are: cyt b558, cytochrome b558; HTG, N-heptyl-β-thioglucoside; TC, ternary complex of recombinant cytosolic proteins p47-p67-p40phox; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; SH3, Src homolog 3; gp, glycoprotein.Activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase can be mimicked in a cell-free system reconstituted with cyt b558, p47phox, p67phox p40phox, and Rac. These cytosolic proteins bind to cyt b558 to form an active oxidase complex, which can generate ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− in the presence of NADPH. The activated NADPH oxidase is highly labile because of the dissociation of each subunit of the active complex (6Tamura M. Takeshita M. Curnutte J.T. Uhlinger D.J. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol.

Sedimentation equilibrium and dynamic light-scattering experiments disclosed that the p47-p67-p40phox complex contains one copy of each protein, and the apparent high molecular weight of this complex, as estimated by gel filtration studies, is because of an extended, nonglobular shape (5Lapouge K.

One plausible model is that FAD is involved in ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generation in NADPH oxidase and that exogenous FAD can restore ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activities in the cell-free system reconstructed with FAD-depleted purified cyt b558 and cytosolic proteins. Detailed information on the behavior of FAD molecules at the FAD-binding site of the NADPH oxidase and its physiological status is requisite to elucidate the electron transfer reactions among the two redox centers, but the behavior of FAD in intact cells is still unclear. Therefore, a simplified in vitro experiment excluding unfavorable side reactions and thermal instability of participating proteins is desired and required.In the present work we describe the reconstitution of NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system with FAD-depleted purified cyt b558 and recombinant FAD-free cytosolic regulatory proteins, i.e. the ternary complex (p47-p67-p40phox) and Rac. We report the effects of exogenously added FAD on the reconstituted activity of NADPH oxidase, and we show that enhancement of the activity by FAD is dependent on the assembly process of the reconstituted oxidase. Furthermore, we show that electron transfer from NADPH to heme under anaerobiosis is restored after incorporating exogenous FAD into FAD-depleted cyt b558. These analyses provide the direct evidence that the electron flow from NADPH to heme via FAD observed is directly related to the ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙−-generating reaction in phagocyte NADPH oxidase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Sodium myristate and diisopropyl fluorophosphates were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals.

The plasmid pProRac2 was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and was overexpressed. The cells were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in PBS including 0.1 mm AEBSF, pH 7.4. The protein was applied on a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with PBS and 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. After washing with a 20-fold column volume of PBS and 10-fold column volume of 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, including 5 mm imidazole, the bound protein was eluted with 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing proteins were purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column and eluted with 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl.Preparation of Binary and Ternary Cytosolic Complexes—To obtain binary complexes of p47-p67phox and p67-p40phox, p67phox was mixed with a 2-fold molar excess of p47phox or p40phox. After the mixtures had been incubated for more than 10 min at 4 °C, the binary complexes were purified from excess uncomplexed protein (p47phox or p40phox) by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column using a buffer containing 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing the binary complexes were concentrated by Centriprep YM-50 to around 10 mg protein/ml.Ternary complex of p47-p67-p40phox was obtained by mixing the binary complex p47-p67phox with a 2-fold molar excess of p40phox.

The ternary complex was concentrated by Centriprep YM-50 to around 10 mg of protein/ml.Preparation of Truncated Binary Complex—Fusion protein between truncated p67phox-(1–242) and truncated p47phox-(151–286) (p67-p47phox truncated binary complex) was constructed by a two-step PCR technique. The first step was amplification of the truncated p67phox gene and the truncated p47phox gene. The DNA fragment encoding p67phox-(1–242) was amplified from the full-length p67phox gene by PCR using primers as follows: 5′-primer (primer A) was 5′-GGCCATATGTCCCTGGTGGAGGCCAATCAGC-3′, including NdeI digestion site at the 5′-end, and 3′-primer (primer B) was 5′-CAGGATGATGGGGCCGGTGATGTCCCCTTCCAGAGCCCTGAAGATCTC-3′, including 24 bases at the 5′-end of p47phox-(151–286). The DNA fragment encoding p47phox-(151–286) was amplified from the full-length p47phox gene with PCR using primers as follows: 5′-primer (primer C) was 5′-GACATCACCGGCCCCATCATCCTG-3′, and 3′-primer (primer D) was 5′-GCGCGAATTCATTAGTCTTGCCCCGACTTTTGCAGGTA-3′, including the stop codon TAA and the EcoRI site. Two PCR products had 24 overlapping base pairs (5′-end of p47phox-(151–286)). For fusion of p67phox-(1–242) gene and p47phox-(151–286) gene as the second step, five cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension were carried out at 98 °C (15 s) and 74 °C (30 s). This fused gene was amplified by an additional 25 thermal cycles under the same conditions using primer A and D. The fused gene was then subcloned into the NdeI-EcoRI site of pET28a, and this plasmid was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3), in which the truncated binary complex was overexpressed. The cells were disrupted by sonication at 4 °C in PBS, pH 7.4, and 0.1 mm AEBSF. The protein was applied on a Ni-NTA column equilibrated with PBS, pH 7.4. The bound protein was eluted with 25 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing proteins were purified on a Superdex 75 gel filtration column.Reconstitution of NADPH Oxidase and Assay for ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− Generation— The ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activity of reconstituted NADPH oxidase complex was determined by the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of cytochrome c, as described previously (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained partially or fully purified cyt b558 (1 pmol of heme), TC (250 nm), and Rac2 (400 nm) in a volume of 100 μl of the assay buffer (1 mm NaN3, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and it was treated with 20 μm GTPγS for 1 min. The reaction mixture above was supplemented with an appropriate amount of amphiphile, such as sodium myristate or arachidonic acid, and incubated at 25 °C for 5 min. Unless specified, the activation was carried out in the presence of FAD. The mixture was transferred to a cuvette containing cytochrome c (final concentration, 50 μm), and the ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙−-generating reaction was started by the addition of 150 μm NADPH. ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− production was measured with a Hitachi dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (model 556) at 550 nm due to the reduction of cytochrome c.Reconstitution of Flavin-depleted Cyt b558 with Native FAD and Assay of Noncovalently bound FAD—Purified FAD-depleted cyt b558 (200 pmol) was mixed with TC (80 nmol) and Rac2 (40 nmol) in the presence or absence of 2 nmol of excess FAD and was incubated with sodium myristate (600 nmol) for 5 min at 25 °C. After the above treatment, the mixture was passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.6% HTG, and 10% glycerol to separate FAD-reconstituted cyt b558 from excess free flavin. FAD-reconstituted cyt b558 fractions were pooled and concentrated by freeze-drying and then boiled at 100 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, FAD in boiled extract of purified cyt b558 fractions was quantified either by fluorometry with a Wallac 1420 ARVOsx (24Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal.

Acta. 1992; 1135: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Calibration was performed with standard solutions of FAD.Measurement of Electron Flux through Redox Centers under Anaerobic Conditions—The electron fluxes through two redox centers, FAD and heme, in cyt b558 were examined. The electron flux from NADPH to heme via FAD in reflavinated cyt b558 was measured by following the absorbance at 558 nm with Unisoku Biospectrophotometer US-401. The extent of reduction in cyt b558 was calculated by using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 21.6 at 558–540 nm (27Gabig T.G. Schervich E.W. Santinga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4114-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral changes of cyt b558 were observed continuously over the 400–600 nm range. Strictly anaerobic conditions were achieved by including glucose/glucose oxidase (40 units/ml) in an airtight cuvette (19Fujii H. Kakinuma K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).RESULTSTernary Complex Used in This Study—The soluble fulllength proteins of p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox were obtained in relatively high yields (>20 mg of protein/liter), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1A shows the gel filtration chromatogram of purified proteins; binary (p47-p67phox) and ternary (p47-p67-p40phox) complexes were fractionated without contamination of monomer components. The molecular mass of purified ternary complex was calibrated by the analytical gel filtration, and the obtained value was around 250 kDa, which was similar to that in the previous report (5Lapouge K. Smith S.J.M. Groemping Y. Rittinger K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10121-10128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows silver-stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified proteins. The purity of each sample is demonstrated by SDS-PAGE; full-length p40phox (lane 1), p47phox (lane 2), p67phox (lane 3), binary (p47-p67phox), and ternary (p47-p67-p40phox) complexes are shown in Fig. 1B.Reconstituted Activity of NADPH Oxidase—Cyt b558 was purified from neutrophil membranes without any modification of the heme environment and was used for evaluation of ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activity in the cell-free system. Heme and FAD associated with the cytochrome preparations at each purification step were measured and are summarized in Table I. Crude membrane contained the heme and FAD of cyt b558 in a molar ratio of about 2.5:1. During the purification, the specific content of FAD decreased, whereas that of the heme increased. These purified cyt b558 exhibited high ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activity in the cell-free system with native cytosol, which shows that cyt b558 used in this study was highly purified without any irreversible protein denaturation.Table IPurification of cyt b588 from resting neutrophil membranesHemeFADHeme/FADActivityaSuperoxide generating activity was evaluated in a cell-free system reconstituted with native cytosol and membrane fractions or purified cyt b558 at 25 °Cpmol/mg proteinmol/s/mol hemeCrude membrane238 ± 15 (n = 15)95 ± 13 (n = 15)2.5114.2 ± 2.5 (n = 15)Crude extract1650 ± 123 (n = 15)432 ± 72 (n = 15)3.8264.5 ± 8.3 (n = 15)Purified cyt b55811,600 ± 950 (n = 12)201 ± 94 (n = 12)57.760.8 ± 6.7 (n = 12)a Superoxide generating activity was evaluated in a cell-free system reconstituted with native cytosol and membrane fractions or purified cyt b558 at 25 °C Open table in a new tab The ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activity of the oxidase was reconstituted in the cell-free system with recombinant, full-length FAD-free cytosolic proteins (Rac2, p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox) and purified cyt b558. Incubation of the cytosolic component individually and in combination or the TC with purified cyt b558 was examined, and the purified cyt b558 showed cytosolic proteindependent superoxide production. In the cell-free reconstituted system, the activity was totally dependent on the addition of both FAD and anionic amphiphile activators (such as myristic acid or arachidonic acid). Replacement of FAD with FMN abolished the stimulation of superoxide production. The remarkably high ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− generating activity of the reconstituted oxidase, over 100 μmol of ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− /s/μmol of heme, was obtainable in the system with TC. The reconstituted oxidase activity with TC (p47-p67-p40phox) was compared with the binary complex p47-p67phox. The activity with TC was 9.9 ± 2.8% (p < 0.05) higher than with p47/p67phox, showing that p40phox is not essential for reconstitution of the activity. Previous findings (28Cross A. Biochem.

In the case of the other binary complexes, p47-p40phox or p67-p40phox, any superoxide generating activity was not detected under similar reaction conditions.Stability of the Reconstituted NADPH Oxidase Activity—The purified ternary complex, p47-p67-p40phox, exists at a tight complex of 1:1:1 stoichiometry in solutions (5Lapouge K.

GH-stimulated formation of GTP-bound RhoA requires JAK2-dependent dissociation of RhoA from its negative regulator p190 RhoGAP. Inactivation of RhoA does not affect GH-stimulated JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation nor p44/42 MAPK activity. However, RhoA and ROCK activities are required for GH-stimulated, Stat5-mediated transcription. RhoA-dependent enhancement of GH-stimulated, Stat5-mediated transcription is due to repression of histone deacetylase 6 activity recruited by transcription cofactor p300 that negatively regulates GH-stimulated, Stat5-mediated transcription. We also demonstrate that RhoA is the pivot for cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibition of GH-stimulated, Stat5-mediated transcription as a consequence of cAMP-dependent protein kinase inactivation of RhoA through serine residue 188 of RhoA.

RhoA belongs to the Rho subfamily of the Ras-related, small GTPase superfamily that consists of five groups as follow: Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A.

RhoA has been demonstrated to be involved in diverse cellular processes including cytoskeleton organization, hormone secretion, gene transcription, cell cycle progression, and cell transformation (2Mackay D.J.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34631-34638Google Scholar, 7Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Google Scholar, 8Chen J.C. Zhuang S. Nguyen T.H. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2807-2818Google Scholar). RhoGDIs negatively regulate RhoGTPases activity by their extraction from plasma membrane and subsequent formation of inactive cytosolic complexes with them (9Olofsson B. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Google Scholar). RhoA activity can be modulated by tyrosine kinases or serine kinases. Tyrosine kinase Src negatively regulates RhoA by activation of p190 RhoGAP (7Arthur W.T. Petch L.A. Burridge K. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 719-722Google Scholar). Another kinase modulating RhoA activity is the serine kinase PKA that has been reported to inactivate RhoA through phosphorylation of RhoA on serine 188 (10Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Beliveau R. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 243-254Google Scholar). Upon activation, RhoA interacts with and stimulates effector proteins, including Rho kinase (ROCK), mDia, protein kinase N, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (11Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Google Scholar). As the most important effector, ROCK is implicated in the various cellular functions downstream of RhoA, such as actin cytoskeleton organization, transformation, and regulation of transcription (11Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Google Scholar, 12Aznar B.S. Valeron P.F. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3041-3054Google Scholar). The first demonstrated transcriptional event regulated by RhoA was lysophosphatidic acid- and serum-induced serum response factor-mediated transcription of the c-fos promoter in NIH-3T3 cells (13Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Google Scholar). To date, several other RhoA-regulated transcription factors have been identified, including NF-κB, Stat3, Stat5, ATF2, Max, and CHOP (14Aznar S. Valeron P.F. del Rincon S.V. Perez L.F. Perona R. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Google Scholar). Stats are important regulators in cytokine signaling and are responsible for transcriptional activation of target genes that control proliferation, differentiation, and survival (15Bromberg J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2468-2473Google Scholar). RhoA triggers simultaneous phosphorylation at both tyrosine and serine residues of Stat3 and subsequent activation of Stat3 essential for oncogenic RhoA-mediated transformation (14Aznar S. Valeron P.F. del Rincon S.V. Perez L.F. Perona R. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3282-3294Google Scholar). RhoA also promotes tyrosine phosphorylation and serine dephosphorylation of Stat5A with a concomitant increase in Stat5A activity to mediate morphological transition induced by oncogenic RhoA (16Benitah S.A. Valeron P.F. Rui H. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 40-53Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for RhoA to regulate gene expression remains unclear, recent studies suggest that it is possibly achieved through the modulation of transcriptional cofactor p300/CBP by RhoA. It has been reported (17Rattan R. Giri S. Singh A.K. Singh I. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1037-1050Google Scholar) that RhoA inhibits inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression via negative regulation of the NF-κB-CBP/p300 pathway. The antagonistic relationship between RhoA and the transcriptional cofactor CBP/p300 suggested above is consistent with the previous findings (18Su L.F. Wang Z. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37037-37044Google Scholar) that RhoA inhibited whereas RhoGDI stimulated CBP/p300-mediated estrogen receptor-dependent transactivation. Growth hormone (GH) regulates proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and chemotaxis in various cell types (19Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar). The predominant mechanism by which GH exerts its cellular function is through regulation of gene transcription (19Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar). Stat5, existing as the two isoforms 5A and 5B encoded by different genes, is a major mediator of GH-dependent transcription (19Zhu T. Goh E.L. Graichen R. Ling L. Lobie P.E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 599-616Google Scholar). GH-stimulated activation of Stat5 requires phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue in Stat5 by JAK2 (20Hansen L.H. Wang X. Kopchick J.J. Bouchelouche P. Nielsen J.H. Galsgaard E.D. Billestrup N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12669-12673Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, the transcriptional activity of Stat5 can be regulated by serine phosphorylation, either positively or negatively dependent on promoter context (21Park S.H. Yamashita H. Rui H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2157-2171Google Scholar). Upon activation by GH, Stat5 binds to interferon-γ-activated sequence-like elements (GLE) in the promoter of several genes, such as the serine protease inhibitor Spi 2.1, insulin I, cytochrome P450 3A, and β-casein genes (22Herrington J. Smit L.S. Schwartz J. Carter-Su C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2585-2597Google Scholar). Recently, chromatin remodeling has also been proposed to regulate GH-stimulated Spi 2.1 gene expression (23Simar-Blanchet A.E. Legraverend C. Thissen J.P. Le Cam A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 391-404Google Scholar). Ras-like small GTPases have also been identified to be required for certain transcriptional events stimulated by GH (24Ling L. Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27301-27311Google Scholar, 25Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Google Scholar, 26Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Google Scholar). Ras and RalA are required for GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase activity and subsequent Elk-1-mediated transcription (25Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Google Scholar, 26Winston L.A. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30837-30840Google Scholar). Rap1 constrains the activity of GH-stimulated p44/42 MAP kinase and subsequent Elk-1-mediated transcription through inactivation of RalA (24Ling L. Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27301-27311Google Scholar). GH stimulation of Rap1 also serves as a switch to activate CrkII-enhanced c-Jun-mediated transcription (24Ling L. Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27301-27311Google Scholar). Rac, a Rho subfamily small GTPase, has also been demonstrated to regulate GH-stimulated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility (28Diakonova M. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10669-10677Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation is generally correlated with histone acetylation by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, and repression is correlated with deacetylation by HDAC complexes (29Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 165-172Google Scholar). The transcription cofactor p300 and its closely related protein CBP, which are ubiquitous and critical regulators of transcription, possess intrinsic HAT activity and can activate transcription through histone acetylation-dependent chromatin remodeling or acetylation of transcription activators, general transcription factors, and chromatin-associated proteins (30Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Google Scholar). Alternatively, they serve as adaptors to bridge transcription factors with the basic transcription machinery to facilitate transcriptional initiation (30Chan H.M. La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2363-2373Google Scholar). However, p300 can also repress transcription. It has been reported that p300 down-regulates c-Myc with subsequent cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition (31Baluchamy S. Rajabi H.N. Thimmapaya R. Navaraj A. Thimmapaya B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9524-9529Google Scholar). A recent report (32Girdwood D. Bumpass D. Vaughan O.A. Thain A. Anderson L.A. Snowden A.W. Garcia-Wilson E. Perkins N.D. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1043-1054Google Scholar) has also identified a repression domain in p300 termed CRD1, which mediates repression of p53-dependent transcription by recruitment of HDAC6 to the transcription complex. Here we demonstrate that cellular stimulation with GH results in the activation of RhoA and its substrate ROCK in NIH-3T3 cells. The activation of RhoA by GH is achieved by JAK2-dependent dissociation of RhoA from p190 RhoGAP. We further demonstrate that GH utilizes the RhoA-ROCK pathway to stimulate Stat5-mediated transcription through RhoA-dependent prevention of recruitment of HDAC6 by p300. We also identify PKA as a negative regulator of GH-stimulated, Stat5-mediated transcription, and this cellular effect of PKA requires the PKA phosphorylatable serine residue 188 of RhoA.

All plasmids were prepared with the plasmid maxiprep kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Cell Culture and Treatment—NIH-3T3 cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Unless otherwise indicated, the concentration of hGH was 50 nm. This concentration of GH was within the physiological range for circulating rodent GH (33Gaur S. Yamaguchi H. Goodman H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1478-C1484Google Scholar). RhoA Activation Assay—Serum-starved cells were stimulated with hGH as indicated and then lysed on ice for 15 min in 1× MLB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, 500 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mini mixture per 10 ml). After that the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and the protein concentrations of the supernatants were measured. 800 μg of cell lysates were immediately affinity-precipitated at 4 °C for 1 h with 30 μg of GST-rhotekin-RBD fusion proteins freshly precoupled to glutathione-agarose beads. The precipitates were washed three times with MLB buffer, and the bound RhoA-GTP was eluted in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and detected by monoclonal RhoA antibody. Immunoprecipitation—After treatment as indicated, cells were lysed at 4 °C for 20 min in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 tablet Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture/10 ml). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were precleared by protein A/G plus agarose. The agarose beads were removed by centrifugation, and then the protein concentrations of the resulting supernatants were determined. For each immunoprecipitation, 500 or 1000 μg of protein was incubated with 2 or 4 μg of the corresponding antibody for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G plus agarose for 1 h or overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with PBS or lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and then resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western Blot Analysis—After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at 22 °C. Blots were then immunolabeled with the desired antibodies for 1 h at 22 °C. For reblotting, membranes were stripped at 50 °C for 30 min in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.7% β-mercaptoethanol). Blots were then washed for 30 min with three changes of PBST at 22 °C. Efficacy of stripping was determined by re-exposure of the membranes to ECL. Thereafter, membranes were reblocked and immunolabeled as desired. Immunolabeling was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips in complete medium until 40-50% confluence and then transfected with C3 exoenzyme. At 24 h of post-transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 16 h and treated with GH for 30 min. After that the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed by PBS, and blocked in 2% BBX (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 250 mm NaCl, prepared in PBS). The cells were then incubated with the polyclonal antibody against Stat5 for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed by BBX, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy3. The nonspecifically bound antibody was removed by washing in BBX. Thereafter, DAPI nuclear staining was performed for 5 min. Labeled cells were visualized with a Leica DM RXA2 fluorescent microscope. Images were converted to the tagged information file format and processed with the Adobe Photoshop program. Nuclear Extraction—Cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mini mixture per 10 ml) at 4 °C for 30 or 60 min. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min and then lysed in 40 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 tablet of Complete™ protease inhibitor mini mixture per 10 ml) at 4 °C for 60 min. The samples were then centrifuged and the supernatants collected. The protein concentration were measured and diluted as described below. Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above. The double-stranded Spi-GLE1 probe was labeled by biotin onto the 3′ end according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 5 pmol of each complementary oligonucleotide of the probe DNA was labeled by biotin-N4-CTP in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at 37 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by EDTA. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was extracted by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. Then the two completed end-labeling reactions were annealed at room temperature for 1 h. The binding reactions for gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay were performed by preincubating 10 μg of nuclear extract of each sample with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA) for 15 min on ice. For supershift analysis, the extracts were incubated with the antibodies against Stat5, RhoA, or p300 for another 10 min on ice. 20 fmol of Spi-GLE1-LUC probe was then added. The binding mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer at 120 V at 4 °C, followed by transfer to Hybond-N® membrane at 380 mA for 30 min. After that, the membrane was blocked for 15 min and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for another 15 min. After washing, the biotin-labeled DNA was detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay—p44/42 MAP kinase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were lysed at 4 °C in the lysis buffer provided, and the cell extract containing 200 μg of protein per sample was incubated for 4 h or overnight with 15 μl of immobilized phospho-specific p44/42 MAP kinase (Tyr-202/Tyr-204) monoclonal antibody. Then the pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer and twice with the 500 μl of kinase assay buffer provided. The kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 2 μg of Elk-1 fusion protein and 200 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. Elk-1 phosphorylation was detected by use of a specific phospho-Elk1 (Ser-383) antibody. ROCK Activity Assay—500 μg of cell lysates per sample were prepared and immunoprecipitated as described previously by ROCK polyclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed by lysis buffer and re-suspended in 50 μl of Tris/ATP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm ATP). The kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 1 μg of recombinant MYPT1-(654-880) at 30 °C for 30 min. MYPT1 phosphorylation was detected by use of a specific phospho-MYPT1 (Thr-696) antibody. p300 HAT Activity Assay—500 μg of nuclear extracts were prepared as described above and then subjected to immunoprecipitation by 10 μg of p300 monoclonal antibody or control monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times by PBS and once by assay buffer (50 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The enzymatic reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 μg of core histones and 20 μm acetyl-CoA containing 0.5 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA. 5 μl of each sample was blotted on the P81 paper in triplicate. The paper squares were washed three times in trichloroacetic acid and once in acetone. The radioactivity was measured by scintillation counter. The counts/min of the enzyme sample was subtracted by that of the negative control sample. Site-directed Mutagenesis—RhoA mutation (R188A) was generated by PCR mutagenesis using Quikchange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primer pairs are: 5′-CGTGGGAAGAAAAAAGCTGGTTGCCTTGTCT-3′ and 5′-AGACAAGGCAACCAGCTTTTTTCTTCCCACG-3′. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Either 0.2 μg of the reporter plasmid pFR-Luc and 4 ng of the fusion trans-activator plasmid pFA2-CREB or 0.5 μg of Spi-GLE1-Luc reporter plasmid were transfected with 0.8 μg of the DNA of interest into cells grown in 2% serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium upon 60-80% cell confluence. 0.4 μg of β-galactosidase reporter vector was co-transfected as the control for transfection efficiency. After 36 h, cells were stimulated with 50 nm GH for 6 h immediately or after chemical pretreatment for 30-60 min. Cells were washed by PBS twice and lysed in RLB buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min. The luciferase activity was measured in the presence of RAB buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, pH 7.8, 15 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP) and 200 nmd-luciferin. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in the assay buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.665 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The luciferase activities were calculated as the fold of stimulation after normalized by protein content and the β-galactosidase activity. Statistical Analysis and Presentation of Data—All experiments were performed at least three times. In the case of Western blot analysis, representative data from one experiment are presented. Numerical data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the two-tailed t test or analysis of variance. Results were considered significant at the 5% level. GH Stimulation of NIH-3T3 Cells Increases the Activity of RhoA—We utilized the GST-fused rhotekin-RBD as a specific probe to determine the level of RhoA activation in lysates of NIH-3T3 cells stimulated by GH. The rhotekin-RBD probe recognizes only the active GTP-bound form but not the inactive GDP-bound form of RhoA (34Reid T. Furayashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Google Scholar). We observed a marked increase in the level of GTP-bound RhoA upon cellular stimulation with GH, persisting from 2 to 30 min after initial GH stimulation, followed by a decline to the basal level 60 min after GH stimulation (Fig. 1A). The GH-stimulated formation of RhoA-GTP was also dose-dependent with an increase in GTP-bound RhoA observed at 5-50 nm GH but not at GH concentrations lower than 0.5 nm (Fig. 1C). GH stimulation of NIH-3T3 cells did not alter the total level of RhoA protein over the examined time periods nor under differential dose conditions (Fig. 1, B and D). Thus, RhoA is a small Ras-like GTPase utilized by GH to exert its effect on cellular function. GH-stimulated Activation of RhoA Requires the Kinase Activity of JAK2—GH activates both JAK2 and c-Src kinases independent of the other (25Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that two other small Ras-like GTPases, Ral and Rap, require the activity of both c-Src and JAK2 to be fully activated by GH (25Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Google Scholar). We therefore examined the requirement of JAK2 and c-Src for GH-stimulated activation of RhoA. As observed in Fig. 1E, upon forced expression of the JAK2 kinase-deficient mutant (K882E) (35Rui L.Y. Gunter D.R. Herrington J. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3168-3177Google Scholar), the basal level of RhoA-GTP was diminished, and GH-stimulated formation of RhoA-GTP was completely prevented. In contrast, forced expression of a c-Src kinase-inactive mutant (K295R/Y527F) (36Rahimi N. Hung W. Tremblay E. Saulnier R. Elliott B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33714-33721Google Scholar), under conditions that prevent GH-stimulated activation of c-Src (25Zhu T. Ling L. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45592-45603Google Scholar), did not alter the ability of GH to stimulate formation of GTP-bound RhoA. Co-transfection of both JAK2-K882E mutant and c-Src-K295R/Y527F mutant prevented the ability of GH to stimulate the activation of RhoA identical to that observed with forced expression of JAK2-K882E mutant alone. Forced expression of the kinase-deficient mutants of JAK2 and c-Src was verified by Western blot"
https://openalex.org/W1986936802,"pH effects on the oligomeric structure of giant Glossoscolex paulistus extracellular hemoglobin in the oxyand met-forms have been studied as well as effects of the addition of anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant. A radius of gyration of 110 Å is observed for a macromolecule. At 2 mm surfactant, the radius of gyration diminishes slightly for the oxy-form. However, the extrapolated initial scattering intensity (I(0)) decreases a factor of 2.5, indicating protein dissociation. At 20 mm surfactant, further I(0) decrease is observed, with a reduction of radius of gyration to approximately 30 Å consistent with dissociation into smaller subunits. At pH 9.0, the scattering curves are similar to that obtained for the protein in the presence of 20 mm surfactant at pH 7.0. A radius of gyration of approximately 35 Å shows that the giant hemoglobin dissociation into small subunits also occurs at alkaline pH. From the I(0) value, one can suggest that the tetramer is the main scatter at pH 9.0. At pH 7.0, the met-form dissociates to a larger extent at 2 mm surfactant as compared with the oxy-form, and the main scatters seem to be the 1/12 subunit. At pH 9.0, for the oxy-form, the addition of surfactant does not modify the scattering curve and a radius of gyration approximately 30 Å is obtained, while for the met-form some kind of aggregation is observed. Our results give support to conclude that the iron oxidation state is an important factor modulating the oligomeric dissociation. pH effects on the oligomeric structure of giant Glossoscolex paulistus extracellular hemoglobin in the oxyand met-forms have been studied as well as effects of the addition of anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant. A radius of gyration of 110 Å is observed for a macromolecule. At 2 mm surfactant, the radius of gyration diminishes slightly for the oxy-form. However, the extrapolated initial scattering intensity (I(0)) decreases a factor of 2.5, indicating protein dissociation. At 20 mm surfactant, further I(0) decrease is observed, with a reduction of radius of gyration to approximately 30 Å consistent with dissociation into smaller subunits. At pH 9.0, the scattering curves are similar to that obtained for the protein in the presence of 20 mm surfactant at pH 7.0. A radius of gyration of approximately 35 Å shows that the giant hemoglobin dissociation into small subunits also occurs at alkaline pH. From the I(0) value, one can suggest that the tetramer is the main scatter at pH 9.0. At pH 7.0, the met-form dissociates to a larger extent at 2 mm surfactant as compared with the oxy-form, and the main scatters seem to be the 1/12 subunit. At pH 9.0, for the oxy-form, the addition of surfactant does not modify the scattering curve and a radius of gyration approximately 30 Å is obtained, while for the met-form some kind of aggregation is observed. Our results give support to conclude that the iron oxidation state is an important factor modulating the oligomeric dissociation. Annelid extracellular hemoglobins are giant molecules that have a characteristic hexagonal bilayer appearence in electron micrographs, high cooperativity of oxygen binding, and low iron and heme contents (1Lamy J.N.

The hemoglobin of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (HbLt) 1The abbreviations used are: HbLt, hemoglobin of the earthworm L. terrestris; HbGp, hemoglobin of G. paulistus; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. is the most extensively studied annelid hemoglobin. It consists of about 180 polypeptide chains in an arrangement of two heme-containing subunits (monomer M and disulfide-bonded trimer T) and non-globin linker subunits with molecular masses in the range 24-32 kDa. A model of quaternary structure (bracelet model) explains the properties and subunit structure of HbLt: three copies of monomer subunit and three copies of the trimer subunit form a dodecamer subunit, (abcd)3 of about 200 kDa. Twelve such complexes of heme-containing chains are linked together by 36 heme-deficient linker chains to provide the total mass of about 3500 kDa. The 1/12 subunit of the whole protein is associated then to (abc)3d3L3, where L stands for the linker chains. Since 1996 a significant effort has been devoted by several laboratories to elucidate in more detail the arrangements between the subunits from the structural point of view to better understand the oxygenation of this giant hemoglobin. The three most important contributions in this research are associated with the mass spectrometry determination of the molecular masses of all subunits (3Martin P.D. Kuchumov A.R. Green B.N. Oliver R.W.A. Braswell E.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 154-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), to the three-dimensional reconstructions at a low resolution of 35 Å obtained by cryoelectron microscopy (1Lamy J.N. Green B.N.

Rev. 1996; 96: 3113-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and which were able to give results on the shape and dimensions of the whole protein, and, finally, to the recently reported crystal structure of Hb of L. terrestris obtained at a resolution of 5.5 Å, which allowed us to establish a complicated hierarchy of overall D6 symmetry, in agreement with previous findings, and local D3 symmetry for smaller subunits as well as the location of the linker chains in the whole oligomeric structure (5Royer Jr., W.E. Strand K. Van Heel M. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7107-7111Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The extracellular hemoglobin of Glossoscolex paulistus (HbGp) is a giant hemoglobin, similar to other annelid hemoglobins, especially to L. terrestris Hb, and is also constituted by a large number of subunits containing heme groups with molecular masses in the range of 12-16 kDa forming a monomer of 16 kDa and a trimer and non-heme structures, named linkers, with molecular masses in the range 24-32 kDa, conferring to the whole protein a molecular mass near 3100 kDa and a double layered hexagonal oligomeric structure (6Costa M.C.P. Bonafé C.F.S. Meirelles N.C. Galembeck F. Braz. J. Med. Res. 1988; 21: 115-118PubMed Google Scholar, 7Imasato H. Tinto M.H. Perussi J.R. Tabak M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 112B: 217-226Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1 a schematic model is shown for the hexagonal bilayer structure of HbGp and HbLt based on the available experimental data, mostly for HbLt, as mentioned above. For HbGp the full amino acid sequence is known only for the monomer chain d (8Cabral C.B. Imasato H. Rosa J.C. Laure H.J. Silva C.H.T.P. Tabak M. Garrat R.C. Greene L.J. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 97: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), although evidence exists for a great similarity of its oligomeric structure with that for HbLt. Fluorescence studies of HbGp have shown that the dissociation of the oxy-form of Hb of G. paulistus at alkaline pH 9 is not complete, resulting in the (abcd)2 fraction as the main product. Changes in the fluorescence for the intact oligomer as well as for the monomer, trimer, and the (abcd)2 fractions can be compared, showing quantum yields consistent with data from other hemoproteins, where a significant quenching due to energy transfer from tryptophans to hemes occurs (9Perussi J.R. Imasato H. Tabak M. Meirelles N.C. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1990; 22: 159-168Google Scholar, 10Agustinho S.C.M. Tinto M.H. Imasato H. Tominaga T.T. Perussi J.R. Tabak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The oxidation of the iron with the production of the met-form of hemoglobin leads to a complete dissociation of the oligomer at pH 9 into its constituent small molecular mass subunits (linkers, trimers, and monomers). The met-form at pH 7 maintains its integral oligomeric structure. SDS has been widely used on SDS-PAGE technique to separate and determine the molecular mass of proteins (11Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. Wiley, New York1973Google Scholar). On the other hand, the study of the interaction of globular proteins with surfactants, in particular with SDS, has been also extensively reported with the aim to understand details of the structure and function of proteins (11Tanford C. The Hydrophobic Effect: Formation of Micelles and Biological Membranes. Wiley, New York1973Google Scholar). Two interesting ranges of surfactant concentrations associated with different effects on the interaction with the protein should be mentioned; the first one, at stoichiometric surfactant concentration, is related to the binding that occurs to specific high energy sites on the protein, being the interactions, mainly, of electrostatic nature; the second one is related to higher surfactant concentrations, above the surfactant critical micellar concentration, where a massive increase in binding due to cooperative ligand interactions takes place (12Turro N.J. Ananthapadmanabhan K.P. Lei X.G. Aronson M. Langmuir. 1995; 11: 2525-2533Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 13Jones M.N. Chapman D. Micelles, Monolayers and Biomenbranes. Wiley-Liss, New York1995Google Scholar). Protein denaturation is believed to occur at these concentrations. According to Reynolds et al. (14Reynolds J.A. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5161-5165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some surfactants, as SDS, bind to proteins promoting their denaturation, e.g. the saturation binding of SDS to bovine serum albumin is 1.4 g of SDS/bovine serum albumin. The structure of protein-surfactant complexes has been studied for many years using several low molecular mass globular proteins such as bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, and others by means of several spectroscopic techniques such as UV-visible absorption (5Royer Jr., W.E.

In our case, the studied protein is a giant multi-oligomeric hemoglobin, and the interaction with surfactant molecules may induce distinct effects such as dissociation at low concentrations and protein denaturation at higher concentrations (25Jones M.N.

In this work, the structural conformation of the extracellular hemoglobin of G. paulistus in the oxy- and met-forms in the absence and presence of the anionic SDS surfactant, at pH 7.0 and 9.0, has been studied by means of SAXS to investigate changes produced in the protein structure upon both alkaline dissociation and interaction with the anionic surfactant. Comparisons are made to the results obtained for the homologous oxy Hb of L. terrestris. The SAXS technique has been used as a powerful tool in the study of proteins, since important parameters such as size and shape can be obtained for the macromolecule (29Semisotnov G.V. Kihara H.

Langmuir. 1994; 10: 1690-1694Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Small angle scattering data treatments have been developed for the purpose of extracting the maximum information about the systems, especially in the case of proteins (33Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), where conformation details can be retrieved from the SAXS data by means of different models of densely packed beads. Those are obtained from the correspondent pair distance distribution functions (p(r)). Previous SAXS studies of HbLt have reported the dimensions of the whole molecule as well as the dodecameric subunit (abcd)3, and one of the relevant results was the fact that the oxygenation did not induce shape or dimension alterations (34Krebs A. Zipper P. Vinogradov S.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The hemoglobin of G. paulistus was prepared by a centrifugation at 4 °C (2500 rpm for 15 min) followed by an ultrafiltration (molecular mass cut-off: 30 kDa) and ultracentrifugation at 250,000 × g at 4 °C during 3 h. The Hb is obtained as a pellet and then resuspended in a minimum amount of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, and stored in the oxy-form at 4 °C. Chromatography at pH 7.0 in a Sephadex G-200 column furnished the samples used in the experiments. The met-form of the hemoglobin was obtained adding an aliquot of ferricyanide stock (0.1 m) to oxyhemoglobin solution followed by filtration in a Sephadex G-25 column to remove the excess of ferricyanide. All concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically in a Hitachi U2000 spectrophotometer using the appropriate molar extinction coefficients (9Perussi J.R. Imasato H. Tabak M. Meirelles N.C. Physiol. Chem. Phys. Med. NMR. 1990; 22: 159-168Google Scholar, 10Agustinho S.C.M. Tinto M.H. Imasato H. Tominaga T.T. Perussi J.R. Tabak M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to obtain a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer. The samples used for SAXS experiments were prepared, in general, 24-48 h prior to the measurements. For samples with surfactant, addition of aliquots of concentrated SDS solutions to the 3 mg/ml protein solution was made to give the desired final SDS concentration. Experiments with samples prepared immediately before the measurements resulted in similar scattering curves suggesting that the equilibrium of different species in solution was reached in a relatively short time. SAXS experiments were performed at the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory, Campinas, Brazil, using a detector-sample distance of 731 mm. The scattering vector amplitude q is defined as q = 4πsinθ/λ, 2θ being the scattering angle and λ the x-ray wavelength of 1.608 Å. The experimental intensities were corrected for sample attenuation, detector homogeneity, and blank scattering. For protein samples containing up to 2 mm SDS, the blank contribution consisted of the surfactant-free buffer solution scattering; once up to such surfactant concentration the scattering curves are identical to that of buffer solution. For the 20 mm SDS-containing HbGp sample, the buffer solution scattering curve was also considered as a blank contribution, because the scattering curve for the protein-surfactant system presented the characteristic scattering of SDS micelles with a broad peak positioned at 0.19 Å-1, while such peak appears at 0.15 Å-1 for protein-free SDS micelles solution (35Caetano W. Gelamo E.L. Tabak M. Itri R. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 2002; 248: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For this reason no attempt was made to subtract the scattering curve of 20 mm surfactant, since the difference in peak positions in these two systems, pure micelles and protein micelles, would lead to artifacts in the corrected protein/surfactant scattering. It is well known that the scattering intensity from a set of monodisperse particles randomly distributed, in the absence of interparticle interference function, is given as, I(q)=kP(q) (Eq. 1) where k = γnp(Δρ)2V2; γ is a factor related to the instrumental effects, np corresponds to the particle number density, Δρ is the electron density contrast between the scattering particle and the medium, and V is the scattering particle volume. P(q) in Equation 1 is the normalized particle form factor (P(0) = 1). A Fourier transform connects P(q), and hence I(q), to the p(r); the probability of finding a pair of small elements at a distance r within the entire volume of the scattering particle is given as follows (36Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar, 37Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-rays Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). p(r)=12π2∫0∞I(q)qrsin(qr)dq (Eq. 2) This function provides information about the shape of the scattering particle as well as its maximum dimension, Dmax, accounted for at a certain r value where p(r) reaches zero. Moreover, the particle radius of gyration (Rg) value is defined as follows (37Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-rays Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). Rg2=∫0∞p(r)r2dr2∫0∞p(r)dr (Eq. 3) In this work, we make use of the GNOM program (38Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar) to calculate p(r) from the SAXS curves. The Rg value can also be evaluated from the scattering curve at low q range where the intensity obeys Guinier's law (36Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar), I(q)=kexp(−Rg2q2/3) (q→0) (Eq. 4) so that Rg can be directly calculated from the slope of the linear part of ln I(q) versus q2 plot. This approximation is valid for values of Rg such that q·Rg < 1. It should be remarked that it is possible to measure the intensity in absolute scale in a SAXS experiment (39Wu C.F. Chen S.H. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 1065-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 40Orthaber D. Bergmann A. Glatter O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 218-225Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar; γ is determined) and, hence, to obtain information about the prefactor np(Δρ)2V2 that is directly related to the scattering particle molecular mass at the initial scattering intensity (I(0)) (36Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar, 37Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-rays Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar). In this work, we were just interested in investigating the differences in the macromolecule scattering functions as a function of added surfactant in relation to the system in the absence of SDS, at different pH values. Therefore, no absolute scale measurement was done at this stage, in such a way that k was used as a normalization factor. Nevertheless, a qualitative comparison and interpretation of the extrapolated I(0) values will be offered into the discussion of the results. An interesting procedure was used to determine the protein shape through a model described by densely packed beads (33Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Such a method restores the low resolution of biological macromolecules in solution by using simulated annealing. This program uses as an input file the p(r) function given by the GNOM program. For details see Ref. 33Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar. An initial symmetry for the model is generally required, because according to theoretical analysis of SAXS curves, the information content is limited by the number of degrees of freedom (Shannon channels) contained in the experimental data (41Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 792-797Crossref Google Scholar). The introduction of symmetry constraints increases the number of degrees of freedom and, consequently, leads to the restoration of a better three-dimensional model (42Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2000; 33: 530-534Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the scattering data of the oxy-HbGp at pH 7.0 in the absence and presence of different SDS concentrations. For detergent-free and 0.2 mm SDS-containing (curve not shown) protein solutions at pH 7.0, the SAXS curves are characterized by two well defined shoulders in the q region of 0.04 Å-1 and 0.07 Å-1 and a third one, not so pronounced, in the q region of 0.12 Å-1. These shoulders are characteristic of extracellular giant hemoglobins (4Zipper P. Krebs A. Progr. Colloid Polymer Sci. 2002; 191: 141-148Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Variation of protein concentration in the range 0.8-6.0 mg/ml showed identical SAXS curves normalized by HbGp concentration, suggesting that in this concentration range no protein interference effect is presented. The SAXS curve of oxy-HbGp at pH 7.0 under the influence of 2 mm detergent (Fig. 2A) does not present the characteristic shoulders (they are not so clear), and the extrapolated initial scattering intensity decreases 2.5-fold as compared with the curve of the protein in the absence of SDS (Fig. 2A). These data are compatible with the fact that the whole protein could dissociate separating initially into two hexagonal layers. Fig. 3, A and B, show the scattering data (open symbols) of oxy-HbGp solution at pH 7.0 in the absence and presence of 2 mm SDS, respectively, along with theoretical curves (solid lines) associated with the corresponding p(r) functions (normalized) shown in Fig. 3C. The Rg and the I(0) obtained from p(r) are included in Table I. The values of Rg ≈ 110 Å and Dmax ≈ 300 Å (Fig. 3C) obtained for oxy-HbGp in the absence and presence of 0.2 mm SDS are similar to those obtained through the SAXS technique for the extracellular hemoglobin of L. terrestris, where Rg = 107-114 Å and Dmax = 294 Å (2Krebs A. Lamy J. Vinogradov S.N. Zipper P. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 34Krebs A. Zipper P. Vinogradov S.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1297: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is worthy to emphasize that the normalized p(r) curves present the same value of scattering particle maximum dimension Dmax (Fig. 3C), although I(0) decreases almost a factor of 2.5 when 2 mm surfactant is added to the protein solution. The densely packed bead models are presented in Fig. 3D. It should be remarked that these models were obtained following two steps; in the first one, no symmetry was imposed, and the result showed a figure with 6-fold symmetry. Then, such symmetry was imposed, and the final model converged to the same structure. In the case of the protein solution in the absence of SDS the observed 6-fold symmetry (top view in Fig. 3D) may correspond to an array of protein subunits forming two hexagonal layers (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with the symmetry, extensively revealed in electron microscopy studies (1Lamy J.N.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). From the top and lateral views (Fig. 3D), the estimated dimensions are 272 and 271 Å, respectively. In fact, assuming that the whole protein molecule can be considered as a cylinder-like (height L and radius R) model (Fig. 1A), a radius of gyration (Rg2 = R2/2 + L2/12) (36Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. Wiley, New York1955Google Scholar, 37Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-rays Scattering. Academic Press, London1982Google Scholar) approximately 124 Å is obtained, taking into account the dimensions estimated from the beads model. The experimental Rg value obtained from p(r) analysis is approximately 12% smaller, probably due to the considered theoretical cylinder model that is just an approximation of the protein structure. The latter (Fig. 1A) contains some cavities that must contribute to the reduction of the Rg value. It is worth mentioning that these estimates are quite similar to the dimensions for HbLt obtained from three-dimensional reconstruction of cryo-microscopic images where values of 308 and 288 Å were obtained for the top and lateral views, respectively (44de Haas F. Kuchumov A. Taveau J.C. Boisset N. Vinogradov S.N. Lamy J.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7330-7338Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 mm SDS the top view dimension is maintained, although the 6-fold symmetry is less defined. This must occur due to a substantial loss of mass related to the protein dissociation process, in agreement with a 2.5-fold decrease instead of a 2-fold one. The presence of bound SDS could also smear or deform the 6-fold symmetry. The lateral dimension is reduced to 96 Å, supporting the hypothesis of the initial dissociation of the oligomer upon addition of 2 mm SDS at pH 7.0. Furthermore, Rg = 100 Å is obtained by considering a cylinder-like model when L = 96 Å is accounted for.

DAAO is a stable homodimer with a FAD molecule tightly bound to each 40-kDa subunit. In this work, the urea-induced unfolding of dimeric DAAO was compared with that of a monomeric form of the same protein, a deleted dimerization loop mutant. By using circular dichroism spectroscopy, protein and flavin fluorescence, 1,8-anilinonaphtalene sulfonic acid binding and activity assays, we demonstrated that the urea-induced unfolding of DAAO is a three-state process, yielding an intermediate, and that this process is reversible. The intermediate species lacks the catalytic activity and the characteristic tertiary structure of native DAAO but has significant secondary structure and retains flavin binding. Unfolding of DAAO proceeds through formation of an expanded, partially unfolded inactive intermediate, characterized by low solubility, by increased exposure of hydrophobic surfaces, and by increased sensitivity to trypsin of the β-strand F5 belonging to the FAD binding domain. The oligomeric state does not modify the inferred folding process. The strand F5 is in contact with the C-terminal α-helix containing the Ser-Lys-Leu sequence corresponding to the type 1 peroxisomal targeting signal, and this structural element interacts with the N-terminal βαβ flavin binding motif (Rossmann fold).

Protein folding/unfolding is a highly cooperative process. It has been shown that the folding/unfolding of small globular proteins occurs via a two-state process, whereas the folding/unfolding of larger proteins (>100 amino acids) is complex and often involves the formation of intermediate(s) (1Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 2Englander S.W. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

The most thorough investigations of protein folding and stability have been done with unusually small proteins, which are folded into single domains and display simple two-state unfolding processes. It is of interest, however, to extend studies to larger, more complex, and therefore more typical proteins. d-Amino acid oxidase (DAAO; EC 1.4.3.3) 1The abbreviations used are: DAAO, d-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3); Cm, concentration of urea to give half-unfolded protein; ANS, 1,8-anilinonaphtalene sulfonic acid. has attracted our attention as a suitably more complex subject because it is considered the paradigm of the dehydrogenase/oxidase class of flavoproteins (4Massey V. Hemmerich P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and in particular of those in which the flavin is noncovalently bound. In fact, many proteins in nature require the noncovalent binding of cofactors to perform their biological activity, and these molecules fold in a cellular environment where their cognate cofactors are present. However, the manner in which cofactors affect the folding pathway remains poorly understood, because kinetic folding studies are frequently conducted in the absence of potentially complicating ligands. Furthermore, flavoproteins are often multisubunit proteins constituted either by identical or by different polypeptide chains. Up to now, deep and complete investigations have been restricted to small flavoproteins, such as flavodoxin (5van Mierlo C.P. van Dongen W.M. Vergeldt F. van Berkel W.J. Steensma E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2331-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To have insights on the relationships between cofactor uptake, the stable interaction between identical subunits (and on its significance), folding, and intracellular trafficking, we undertook a study of the stability of structural elements in the peroxisomal flavoenzyme DAAO from the yeast Rhodotorula gracilis. Proteins destined for the peroxisome are synthesized on free ribosomes of the cytoplasm and transported into peroxisomes post-translationally. There are two types of peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS); the first one (PTS1) is the SKL C-terminal sequence (or some conservative variants of it) (6Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Terlecky S.R. Fransen M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proteins belonging to this group are made at their mature size, do not undergo cleavage of the targeting sequence upon transport into peroxisome, and have cytosolic receptors that mediate their association with the peroxisomal import machinery (6Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 7Terlecky S.R. Fransen M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that stably folded proteins are substrates for peroxisomal import (8Walton P.A. Hill P.E. Subramani S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). DAAO catalyzes the dehydrogenation of d-isomers of amino acids, to give the corresponding α-keto acids, ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. DAAOs have been the object of extensive investigation (9Curti B. Ronchi S. Pilone Simonetta M. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. III. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 69-94Google Scholar, 10Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In solution, DAAO from R. gracilis is a stable 80-kDa homodimer, with a molecule of FAD tightly (Kd = 2 × 10-8m) but noncovalently bound to each 40-kDa subunit. The three-dimensional structure of DAAO has been resolved at very high resolution, allowing investigators to find the rationale of its high catalytic efficiency (11Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 12Pollegioni L. Diederichs K. Molla G. Umhau S. Welte W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the “side to tail” model of monomer-monomer interaction (with a high buried surface area, 3049 Å2) (12Pollegioni L. Diederichs K. Molla G. Umhau S. Welte W. Ghisla S. Pilone M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 535-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a large contribution to the interaction between monomers is given by a long (21 amino acids) loop connecting β-strands F5 and F6, that is unique to yeast DAAO. Recently, by rational design and site-directed mutagenesis, a stable monomeric holoenzyme form of DAAO has been obtained by partial elimination of this loop (from Ser308 to Lys321; SPLSLGRGSARAAK) (13Piubelli L. Caldinelli L. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Δ loop mutant DAAO shows slightly altered spectral and kinetic properties, a lower temperature stability, and a 5-fold increase in the Kd for FAD binding compared with the wild-type enzyme. We also demonstrated the possibility of obtaining a monomeric form of yeast DAAO by treatment with 0.5 m NH4SCN, without deletion of the βF5-βF6 loop (14Pollegioni L. Iametti S. Fessas D. Caldinelli L. Piubelli L. Barbiroli A. Pilone M.S. Bonomi F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as well as by removal of the coenzyme to yield the corresponding apoprotein (10Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This latter result suggests a structural relationship between the FAD-harboring domain and the regions involved in dimerization. Recently, temperature ramp experiments following different probes allowed the identification of a clear sequence of events in the course of thermal unfolding of wild-type and Δ loop protein forms (14Pollegioni L. Iametti S. Fessas D. Caldinelli L. Piubelli L. Barbiroli A. Pilone M.S. Bonomi F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Apparently, a first, low temperature energetic domain relates to the unfolding of tertiary structure regions, whereas a second energetic domain relates to the loss of secondary structure elements and to the release of the cofactor at higher temperatures. In this paper, we expand the results obtained until now and report a novel, reversible step in the urea-induced unfolding pathway of R. gracilis DAAO that we believe may be relevant to intracellular trafficking of DAAO. Furthermore, to provide a basis for understanding the structure-function relationships in flavoproteins and the determinants of their stability, we have attempted to compare the chemical unfolding of dimeric DAAO with that of a monomeric form obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. Materials—Recombinant wild-type and Δ loop mutant DAAO were expressed and purified from E. coli cells as described previously (13Piubelli L. Caldinelli L. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Molla G. Vegezzi C. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 14: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Starting from a 10-liter fermentation broth, 180 and 80 mg of pure enzyme with a specific activity of 110 and 86 units/mg protein were obtained for wild-type and Δ loop DAAO, respectively. The enzyme concentration was determined by using extinction coefficients at 455 nm of 12.6 mm-1 cm-1 for wild-type and 11.3 mm1 cm-1 for Δ loop DAAOs (10Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Piubelli L. Caldinelli L. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Urea was from Pierce, and the other reagents were of analytical grade. DAAO Activity Assay—DAAO activity was assayed with an oxygen electrode at pH 8.5, air saturation, and 25 °C, using 28 mm d-alanine as substrate in the presence of 0.2 mm FAD (10Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The effect of urea concentration on enzyme activity of DAAO was determined using the oxygen-electrode assay on protein samples previously incubated at 15 °C for 40 min in the presence of different concentrations of urea. Spectroscopy—All fluorescence measurements were performed by using a 1-ml cell in a Jasco FP-750 instrument equipped with a thermostated cell holder. Tryptophan emission spectra were taken from 300 to 400 nm using excitation wavelengths of 280 and 298 nm. Flavin emission spectra were recorded from 475 to 600 nm using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm; 10- and 20-nm bandwidths were used for excitation and emission, respectively. Steady-state fluorescence measurements were performed at 15 °C and at 0.02 mg/ml protein concentration. All spectra were corrected by subtracting the emission of the buffer. ANS binding experiments were carried out at 15 °C and at 2.5 μm (0.1 mg/ml) protein concentration. Protein samples were incubated for 40 min in buffer containing different concentrations of urea, and ANS was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded in the 450–600-nm range using an excitation wavelength of 370 nm. CD spectra were recorded on a J-810 Jasco spectropolarimeter and analyzed by means of Jasco software. The cell path was 1 cm for measurements above 250 nm and 0.1 cm for measurements in the 190–250-nm region. Proteins were in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA. Equilibrium Unfolding Experiments—The unfolding equilibrium of DAAO was determined by following the changes in flavin and protein fluorescence as detailed above. To establish the time required to reach the equilibrium, the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of time until no further changes were observed (40 min at 15 °C). Each point of the urea denaturation curves was determined on individual samples, prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of protein, 8 m urea in buffer, and plain buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA). Refolding of DAAO—Wild-type and Δ loop DAAOs were incubated at various fixed concentrations of urea for 40 min at 15 °C. The enzymes were refolded by the dilution method (10× dilution at 15 °C) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm EDTA. The refolding yield was determined by monitoring protein and flavin fluorescence, and the recovery of enzymatic activity (which was measured using the values for the native and fully denatured enzymes as reference). Data Analysis—Unfolding curves were usually analyzed using a two-state mechanism. Unfolding curves for the N ↔ D transition were normalized to the apparent fraction of the unfolding form, FD, using the following equation (16Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2435) Google Scholar), FD=(Y−YN)/(YU−YN) (Eq. 1) where Y is the observed variable parameter, and YN and YU are the values characteristic of the native and fully unfolded conformations, respectively. The difference in free energy between the folded and the unfolded state, ΔG, was calculated by the following equation, ΔG=−RTlnK=−RTln[FU/(1−FU)] (Eq. 2) where K is the equilibrium constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The data were analyzed assuming the free energy of unfolding or refolding, ΔG, to be linearly dependent on the urea concentration (denoted here by C), as described in detail previously (17Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), ΔG=ΔGw−mC=m(Cm−C) (Eq. 3) in which ΔGw and ΔG represent the free energy of unfolding or refolding in the absence and presence of urea, respectively; Cm is the midpoint concentration of urea required for unfolding or refolding; and m stands for the slope of the unfolding or refolding curve at Cm. A least-squares curve fitting analysis was used to calculate the values of ΔGw, m, and Cm by a software routine. The same equation accounts for the free energy of formation of partly unfolded folding intermediates from native molecules. The urea-unfolding curves corresponding to a two-state model were analyzed using Equation 4, derived from Ref. 18Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, that incorporates Equations 1, 2, 3.

Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry Analysis after Limited Tryptic Digestion—Following incubation of 1 mg/ml wild-type DAAO with 0.1% trypsin at 15 °C for 30 min in the absence and in the presence of 2 m urea, the reaction mixture (50 μg) was fractionated by high pressure liquid chromatography using an HP 1100 modular system (Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA). Samples were loaded onto a Vydac 218TP52, 5-μm reversed-phase C18, 250 × 2.1-mm column. Solvent A was water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A linear gradient from 5 to 70% solvent B was applied over 90 min, after 5 min of isocratic elution at 5% solvent B, at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. UV detection was carried out at 220 nm. Effluents were directly injected, through a 100-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary, into the electrospray source of a Platform single quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK). The ESI mass spectra were scanned, in the positive ion mode, from 2000 to 800 units at a scan cycle of 4.9 s/scan and 0.1-s interscan delay. The source temperature was 200 °C, and the capillary and orifice voltages were 3.6 kV and 40 V, respectively. Mass scale calibration was performed using the multiple charged ions from a separate injection of horse heart myoglobin (20Iametti S. Rasmussen P. Frøkiær H. Ferranti P. Addeo F. Bonomi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1362-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mass spectra were elaborated using the software MassLynx 2.0, furnished with the spectrometer. Mass values were reported as average masses. Wild-type and Δ loop DAAOs are purified as holoenzymes showing little difference in the visible absorbance spectra (10Pilone M.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1732-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13Piubelli L. Caldinelli L. Molla G. Pilone M.S. Pollegioni L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). On the contrary, spectral properties depending on the protein folding (flavin and protein fluorescence and UV CD spectra) profoundly distinguish the monomeric and dimeric DAAO forms. Tryptophan emission fluorescence at 345 nm (following excitation at 280 nm), a marker of protein conformation, is 2–3-fold higher for native Δ loop than for wild-type DAAO, indicating a lower relevance of quenching interactions between tryptophan side chains (in particular that of Trp243 at the monomer-monomer interface) and nearby side chains in the monomeric form of yeast DAAO with respect to the dimeric form (14Pollegioni L. Iametti S. Fessas D. Caldinelli L. Piubelli L. Barbiroli A. Pilone M.S. Bonomi F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The emission fluorescence of the FAD cofactor at 520 nm, following excitation at 450 nm, is higher for Δ loop than for wild-type DAAOs, pointing to a different microenvironment surrounding the FAD coenzyme in the two proteins (14Pollegioni L. Iametti S. Fessas D. Caldinelli L. Piubelli L. Barbiroli A. Pilone M.S. Bonomi F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the protein and flavin emission fluorescence determined for the urea-unfolded forms of wild-type and Δ loop DAAOs are quite similar at 8 m urea (see Table I). For both proteins, unfolding by urea is accompanied by an increase in both flavin and tryptophan fluorescence.Table IComparison of thermodynamic parameters for urea-induced unfolding of native wild-type and Δ loop DAAOs at 15 °C, monitored by measurement of protein and flavin fluorescence (excitation (exc) at 280 and 450 nm, respectively) and CD DAAO samples were at a 0.02 mg of protein/ml concentration for fluorescence measurements and at a 0.5 mg of protein/ml concentration for CD measurements.ParameterWild typeΔ loopexc 280 nmaValues similar to those reported were also obtained using the protein fluorescence values determined following the excitation at 298 nm.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1116-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar Open table in a new tab Far-UV CD spectra of monomeric and dimeric DAAOs did not reveal any major difference in the features related to the secondary structure of the two proteins, whereas the near-UV CD spectra of the wild-type and Δ loop mutant DAAO were different. The differences have been ascribed to a different contribution from aromatic amino acid residues, which are responsible for most transitions in the near-UV spectral region. Since the deleted portion does not contain aromatic residues, the different spectroscopic features of the two proteins have been explained in terms of an altered mutual relationships between nearby structural elements (14Pollegioni L. Iametti S. Fessas D. Caldinelli L. Piubelli L. Barbiroli A. Pilone M.S. Bonomi F. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Following the addition of ≥6 m urea, the far- and near-UV spectra of both wild-type and Δ loop DAAOs were superimposible. The stability of wild-type and Δ loop DAAO forms was studied at first by equilibrium unfolding measurements. In the experiments reported below, different spectroscopic signals, catalytic activity, and the associative behavior of both proteins were monitored after equilibration in the presence of increasing urea concentration. Protein Fluorescence—Tryptophan emission fluorescence can be considered a sensitive marker of protein conformation and in particular of changes in hydrophobic regions of the structure. The intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues was used as probe of the unfolding of DAAO. Because there are eight tryptophans in yeast DAAO (11Umhau S. Pollegioni L. Molla G. Diederichs K. Welte W. Pilone M.S. Ghisla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12463-12468Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the overall changes in fluorescence reflect global changes in protein structure, and only the average microenvironments of tryptophans can be assessed. As stated above, tryptophan emission at ∼345 nm (following excitation at 280 or 298 nm) is significantly higher for Δ loop DAAO than for wild type. At increasing urea concentration, the two DAAO forms show a different increase in the intensity of the protein emission that is anyway complete at 2–3 m urea (Fig. 1). Treatment with urea also causes the emission maximum of tryptophan fluorescence in both DAAO forms to shift from 337 nm for wild-type and 339 nm for Δ loop DAAO to 352–353 nm at 5–6 m urea, a change that does not parallel the change in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1). The fluorescence red shift stems from transfer of tryptophan side chains to a more polar environment upon protein unfolding (21Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Plots of changes in the intensity protein fluorescence at equilibrium as a function of the urea concentration apparently suggest a simple two-state transition (Fig. 1). The free energy of unfolding, ΔG, was calculated according to Equation 2. The free energy of unfolding in the absence of the denaturant (ΔGw) can be obtained by extrapolation of ΔG to zero denaturant concentration by using Equation 3. The energy value determined for the monomeric Δ loop enzyme is lower than the value for wild-type DAAO (Table I). The different dependence of the intensity of protein fluorescence and of the wavelength of emission maximum on the urea concentration indicates that the overall urea-induced denaturation of DAAO is a more complex process, pointing to the presence of a detectable intermediate. Flavin Fluorescence—As shown in Fig. 2, urea-dependent changes in flavin fluorescence are indicative of a two-step, three-state process for both proteins. An intermediate is formed at ∼3 m urea, and apparently it retains a bound cofactor, since its flavin fluorescence does not correspond to the much higher one typical of free flavin (10Pilone M.S.

Considering the transition occurring at ≤3 m urea, increasing urea concentrations have a different effect on the two proteins. Flavin fluorescence of the Δ loop mutant starts to increase at lower urea concentration than that of wild-type DAAO. At ≥7 m urea, the fluorescence intensity of wild-type DAAO attains values similar to those of the Δ loop mutant and corresponds to that of the free flavin. Equilibrium values determined from changes in flavin fluorescence, analyzed by using Equation 5 according to a three-state mechanism, are reported in Table I. The increase in protein and flavin fluorescence at increasing concentrations of urea is different for the two DAAO forms (as confirmed by the Cm values in Table I), and changes in tryptophan fluorescence in both proteins appear to anticipate release of flavin cofactor (Figs. 1 and 2). Secondary and Tertiary Structure: CD Studies—To test whether the unfolding transition monitored by fluorescence measurements reflects a disruption of the overall protein structure or is just indicative of local unfolding and to have a better knowledge of the structural properties of the intermediate detected at ∼3 m urea, we analyzed urea-induced denaturation of both DAAO forms by CD spectroscopy. When urea-induced loss of secondary structure elements was monitored by following the changes in ellipticity at 223 nm (Fig. 3A), a different increase in the CD signal is observed for the two DAAO forms. The increase of the 223-nm signal (corresponding to the unfolding of the secondary structure elements) starts at 1 m urea for the monomeric Δ loop DAAO, but only at ≥2.0 m urea for the dimeric wild-type enzyme. In both cases, a two-state transition is observed, with Cm values significantly higher than those observed in protein fluorescence studies and for the first transition seen in flavin fluorescence studies and leading to formation of the intermediate (Table I). Thus, the observed transition may correspond to loss of the secondary structure of the intermediate (which accumulates at [urea] ≈ 2.5 m; see above) and to conversion of the intermediate into an unfolded state. Analysis of the CD spectra recorded on either protein at 3 m urea allowed a calculation of the residual content of secondary structures. α-Helix content decreased from 30.4% in the native wild-type protein to 25.2% (from 33.3 to 22.4% in Δ loop mutant DAAO), with a concomitant increase in random coiled structures (from 35.2 to 39.2% in wild-type DAAO and from 33.2 to 41.7% in Δ loop mutant DAAO). The addition of urea also has different effects on the tertiary structure of both wild-type and Δ loop mutant DAAO (as shown by the change in CD signals at 253 nm) (Fig. 3B). A two-state transition is observed at significantly lower denaturant concentration for the monomeric Δ loop mutant than for wild-type DAAO. This suggests that dimer dissociation sensibly altered the tertiary structure in each monomer and confirms a much higher sensitivity to urea for the Δ loop DAAO mutant with respect to the wild-type protein. For both proteins, changes in tertiary structu"

Here we report that 4.1 is critical for spindle assembly and the formation of centrosome-nucleated and motor-dependent self-organized microtubule asters in metaphase-arrested Xenopus egg extracts. Immunodepletion of 4.1 disrupted microtubule arrays and mislocalized the spindle pole protein NuMA. Remarkably, assembly was completely rescued by supplementation with a recombinant 4.1R isoform. We identified two 4.1 domains critical for its function in microtubule polymerization and organization utilizing dominant negative peptides. The 4.1 spectrin-actin binding domain or NuMA binding C-terminal domain peptides caused morphologically disorganized structures. Control peptides with low homology or variant spectrin-actin binding domain peptides that were incapable of binding actin had no deleterious effects. Unexpectedly, the addition of C-terminal domain peptides with reduced NuMA binding caused severe microtubule destabilization in extracts, dramatically inhibiting aster and spindle assembly and also depolymerizing preformed structures. However, the mutant C-terminal peptides did not directly inhibit or destabilize microtubule polymerization from pure tubulin in a microtubule pelleting assay. Our data showing that 4.1 is a crucial factor for assembly and maintenance of mitotic spindles and self-organized and centrosome-nucleated microtubule asters indicates that 4.1 is involved in regulating both microtubule dynamics and organization.

Protein 4.1, formerly characterized solely as a crucial membrane skeletal protein in mature red cells, is now also recognized to be an important multifunctional structural protein family in nucleated cells. Although protein 4.1 can be plasma membrane-associated in nucleated cells, it also is detected at diverse and interesting subcellular locations during the cell cycle. Protein 4.1 isoforms localize within the nucleus and at centrosomes during interphase, at spindle poles during mitosis, in perichromatin at anaphase, and in the midbody at telophase (1Krauss S.W.

Beyond the characterization of its localization, the current challenge is to decipher functions of 4.1 in various subcellular structures. Although the list remains incomplete, a number of protein 4.1 binding partners have been identified to interact with a specific 4.1 domain in red cells and/or nucleated cells, providing some clues as to potential 4.1 functions (see Fig. 1). Prototypical protein 4.1 (R, red cell) contains several functional domains. An N-terminal extension present only in some isoforms in nucleated cells has been found to interact with the centrosomal protein CPAP (centrosome protein-4.1 associated protein) (15Hung L.Y. Tang C.J. Tang T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7813-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The FERM (4.1/erzin, radixin/moesin) domain interacts with plasma membrane-binding proteins and was recently discovered to also contain a microtubule binding site (16Perez-Ferreiro C.M. Luque C.M. Correas I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44785-44791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The spectrin-actin binding domain (SABD 1The abbreviations used are: SABD, spectrin-actin binding domain; NuMA, nuclear mitotic apparatus protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; R, red cell.1The abbreviations used are: SABD, spectrin-actin binding domain; NuMA, nuclear mitotic apparatus protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; R, red cell.) is capable of forming ternary complexes with spectrin and actin. The C-terminal domain is of particular interest, because it has been found to interact with NuMA (nuclear mitotic apparatus protein) (17Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that 4.1 plays diverse roles within the cytoskeleton. Recently we showed (18Krauss S.W. Chen C. Penman S. Heald R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10752-10757Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 19Krauss S.W. Heald R. Lee G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44339-44346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that 4.1 is essential for the assembly of functional nuclei in interphasic Xenopus egg extracts and requires its capacity to bind actin, which is found closely associated with 4.1 on nuclear filaments in mammalian cells. This latter observation was recently confirmed and extended in a study (20Kiseleva E. Drummond S.P. Goldberg M.W. Rutherford S.A. Allen T.D. Wilson K.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) that characterized an extensive system of nuclear pore-linked filaments in Xenopus oocytes that contain actin and 4.1 epitopes. Here we provide evidence that 4.1 is also essential during mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts for proper polymerization and organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton. During interphase, centrosomes nucleate and organize a radial array of microtubules. We characterized protein 4.1 previously as an integral centrosome component, resisting vigorous salt/detergent extraction and present at centrosomes independent of microtubules (1Krauss S.W. Chasis J.A. Rogers C. Mohandas N. Krockmalnic G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7297-7302Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence and cell whole mount electron microscopy 4.1 epitopes localized on centrioles, in the pericentriolar matrix, and on the fibers connecting the centriolar pair (1Krauss S.W.

During mitosis duplicated centrosomes become the poles of the mitotic spindle apparatus, contributing to the organization of microtubules into a bipolar array with their minus ends focused at the poles and their plus ends interacting with chromosomes and overlapping within the center of the spindle. Ultimately responsible for accurate chromosome segregation, spindle function is also dependent on a variety of microtubule-based motor proteins including dynein and kinesin-related proteins that cross-link and sort microtubules according to their structural polarity, and mediate chromosome interactions within the spindle. Proper spindle pole organization is known to depend on the function of NuMA, which interacts with dynein and contributes to microtubule minus-end cross-linking to maintain spindle pole structure (as reviewed in Ref. 21Merdes A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (22Compton D.A. Szilak I. Cleveland D.W. J.

Taken together, the observations that protein 4.1 binds to NuMA and localizes to centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles raise the intriguing hypothesis that protein 4.1 is involved in cell division. In this report we used Xenopus egg extracts, a powerful system for in vitro dissection of mitotic microtubule assembly, organization, and function. Xenopus eggs are laid arrested in the metaphase of meiosis II by cytostatic factor, until fertilization triggers a calcium wave promoting entry into the first mitotic cell cycle. Extracts prepared from unfertilized eggs maintain the cytostatic factor metaphase arrest. Mitotic microtubule asters analogous to spindle poles can be assembled in cytostatic factor extracts through the addition of purified centrosomes that directly nucleate microtubules, or by the addition of microtubule stabilizing agents such as Me2SO or taxol that induce microtubule polymerization. In the absence of centrosomes, asters are progressively organized into a focused array of minus ends by motor proteins including dynein and are similarly dependent on the activity of NuMA (24Gaglio T. Saredi A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 693-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 27Gaglio T. Saredi A. Bingham J.B. Hasbani M.J. Gill S.R. Schroer T.A. Compton D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Complete mitotic spindle assembly can be induced by adding demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei, as the centriole-containing basal body of the flagellum remains tightly attached to the sperm and becomes competent to nucleate microtubules in the extract, defining the spindle poles. Thus, the Xenopus system can be used to probe both centrosome-nucleated and motor-dependent organization of microtubules into asters, as well as the more complex events of mitotic spindle assembly. Taking advantage of the open nature of this cell-free system, we present data establishing that protein 4.1 is essential for assembly of these microtubule-based structures by demonstrating that 4.1 depletion of extracts produces aberrant structures. Proper assembly can be restored by the addition of recombinant 4.1. Furthermore we have identified two 4.1 domains critical for spindle, centrosome, and microtubule aster assembly in assays utilizing dominant negative peptides corresponding to 4.1 domains. Our results indicate that 4.1 is involved in regulating both microtubule dynamics and organization and underscore an important functional context for protein 4.1 in cell division. Materials—Expression vectors for His6 fusion peptides were either pMW172 (the gift of Dr. M. Way, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) or pET 28 (Novagen). The antibody against NuMA was a very generous gift of Dr. A. Merdes (U. Edinburgh, Scotland). IgGs against 4.1R SABD and 4.1R C-terminal domain were described (2Krauss S.W. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Bovine brain tubulin was prepared according to Ashford et al. (28Ashford A. Andersen S. Hyman A. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 206-212Google Scholar). Xenopus Extracts and Assembly Reactions—10,000 × g cytoplasmic Xenopus egg extracts and demembranated sperm nuclei were prepared as described (29Murray A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). For spindle assembly, demembranated Xenopus sperm were added to 20 μl of egg extract on ice with 0.2 mg/ml Texas Red-labeled tubulin, reactions incubated at 20 °C for 30-45 min., diluted with BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8) containing 30% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100 and spun through BRB80 cushions with 40% glycerol onto coverslips (30Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Self-organized microtubule asters were assembled by addition of Me2SO (final concentration 5%) to the egg extract and incubation for 15 min at 20 °C (31Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Centrosome asters were assembled for 15 min at 20 °C after the addition of 1 μl of KE37 centrosomes at 2 × 108/ml, prepared according to Moudjou and Bornens (32Moudjou M. Bornens M. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2. Academic Press, London, England1998: 111-119Google Scholar), to 20 μl of extract that had been centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor. Centrosome or self-organized aster reactions were diluted with BRB80 containing 15% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100 and spun onto coverslips through a cushion of BRB80 containing 30% glycerol. Indirect Immunofluorescence—In vitro assembled structures on coverslips were fixed in -20 °C MeOH and probed by immunofluorescence as described (33Heald R. Tournebize R. Habermann A. Karsenti E. Hyman A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The concentrations of primary antibodies were: SABD IgG, 5 μg/ml; C-terminal domain IgG, 10 μg/ml; anti-NuMA, 1:50 dilution. Secondary antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution. Samples probed with equal amounts of control non-immune IgG or without primary antibody or sera showed no fluorescent patterns. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse 2000 microscope equipped with a CCD camera and processed using Adobe PhotoShop. Under the imaging conditions used, the limits of resolution of overlap between two fluorophores (e.g. superimposition of red and green signals to generate yellow coloration) was estimated to be ∼300 nm. Expression and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—Protein 4.1-related peptides were expressed and purified as described (19Krauss S.W. Heald R. Lee G. Nunomura W. Gimm J.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A.

Assays with His6 peptides (1-8 μg) were preincubated on ice for 10 min then incubated at 20 °C for assembly of spindles, centrosome asters, or self-organized asters as indicated. Although a range of 1-8 μg was tested for each peptide, the data presented are from experiments using 8 μg of the indicated peptide. Microtubule Co-pelleting Assay—Solutions of 4.1 peptides and of 35 μm tubulin and 1 mm GTP in BRB80 were precleared by centrifugation in a TL-100 rotor for 15 min at 40,000 rpm at 4 °C. Reactions containing 1mm GTP, 35 μm tubulin, 35 μm peptide were mixed on ice, Me2SO was added (final concentration 5%), the reaction was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, layered onto 40%/BRB80 sucrose cushions, and microtubules were pelleted at 40,000 rpm for 20 min in a TL-100 rotor. Equivalent amounts of supernatant and pellet were analyzed by Western blotting of a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. By this assay, inhibitors of microtubule formation show tubulin remaining in the supernatant (34Wignall S. Gray N. Chang Y.-T. Juarez L. Jacob R. Burlingame A. Schultz P. Heald R. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Immunodepletion and Rescue—For 4.1 depletion from Xenopus extracts, protein G-coupled magnetic beads (Dynal) from 100 μl of slurry were mixed with 15 μg of 4.1R SABD, C-terminal domain IgGs or non-immune rabbit IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed twice with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (57.7% Na2HPO4 and 42.3% NaH2PO4, v/v), and three times with XB buffer (29Murray A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar) then divided into three aliquots. Extract (100 μl) was successively depleted three times by rotation with IgG-coupled beads at 4 °C for 1 h, beads were collected magnetically, and extract was used for the assembly of spindles, centrosome asters, or self-organized asters. Extract depletion was estimated by densitometry of Western blots using an Alpha Imager 2200 and software. In rescue experiments, 1-9 μg of purified bacterially expressed 80-kDa 4.1R was added to 20-μl reactions and incubated on ice for 10 min prior to the initiation of assembly. Reactions in three independent experiments were sampled during 15-45-min incubation periods for the assembly of spindles, centrosomes, or asters. The experiment presented was performed in parallel using the same depleted extract as described (19Krauss S.W. Heald R. Lee G. Nunomura W. Gimm J.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using a variety of mammalian cells established that 4.1 is localized to centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles. As the Xenopus laevis 4.1 sequence has many highly homologous regions relative to mammalian family members, including the SABD and C-terminal domains (Fig. 1) (19Krauss S.W. Heald R. Lee G. Nunomura W. Gimm J.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44339-44346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we anticipated a similar 4.1 localization in Xenopus. Furthermore, 4.1 function was shown to be conserved between the frog and mammals in studies reconstituting properties of 4.1-deficient human erythrocyte membranes using a recombinant Xenopus 4.1 domain (35Winardi R. Discher D. Kelley C. Zon L. Mays K. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Blood. 1995; 86: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first verified that 4.1 epitopes could be detected in centrosomes and mitotic spindles of cultured Xenopus fibroblasts (data not shown). Next we incubated cytostatic factor-arrested Xenopus egg extracts either with demembranated Xenopus sperm to assemble mitotic spindles or with centrosomes from KE37 cells to reconstitute centrosome-based microtubule arrays (referred to as centrosome asters). We also induced the motor-dependent assembly of stabilized microtubules into asters by adding 5% Me2SO to the egg extract (referred to as self-organized asters). This allowed us to examine both centrosome-nucleated and motor-organized structures. In each reaction, microtubules were stained by the addition of trace amounts of rhodamine-labeled tubulin. When each of these structures was probed by immunofluorescence microscopy using affinity-purified antibodies against the 4.1R SABD or C-terminal domain or against the 80-kDa 4.1R, strong 4.1 signals were concentrated at the minus ends of microtubules focused at the spindle poles and also in the center of both centrosome and self-assembled asters (Fig. 2). Immunodepletion of 4.1 Compromises Assembly of Microtubule-based Structures and Can Be Rescued by Supplementation with Recombinant 4.1R—To test whether the protein 4.1 itself is essential for the assembly of spindles, centrosome asters, and self-organized asters, we depleted 4.1 from Xenopus extracts using 4.1 domain-specific affinity-purified IgGs bound to protein G magnetic beads. Previously (19Krauss S.W. Heald R. Lee G. Nunomura W. Gimm J.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44339-44346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) we showed by Western blotting that Xenopus extracts contain protein bands from ∼47 to 110 kDa detected by SABD and C-terminal domain IgGs, which were reduced by 50-100% after three rounds of antibody depletion. Using 4.1-immunodepleted extracts, we evaluated the morphology of spindles, centrosomes, and self-organized microtubule asters, and as an additional indicator of structural integrity, we localized the 4.1 binding partner/spindle pole protein NuMA by immunofluorescence. In controls, NuMA largely localized with 4.1 epitopes in a tight focus at the spindle poles, and in the centers of centrosome and self-organized microtubule asters (Figs. 2 and 3). Normal spindles, centrosome asters, and self-organized asters assembled in egg extracts mock-depleted with nonspecific IgG and protein G beads (Fig. 3A). In contrast, there was a dramatic morphological disruption of all microtubule structures assembled in extracts depleted with either 4.1 domain-specific SABD or C-terminal domain IgGs. In spindles assembled in either depleted extract, chromosomes were not aligned equidistant from the poles but were looped out of the spindle midzone (Fig. 3A). Spindles formed in SABD-depleted extracts most often were multipolar, whereas those from C-terminal domain-depleted extracts generally had large unfocused poles. Centrosome asters were disorganized microtubule arrays without an obvious focal center revealed by NuMA staining (Fig. 3B). In SABD-depleted extracts, centrosomes asters often contained multiple small NuMA foci radiating several bundles of microtubules. Similarly, self-organized asters assembled in either the C-terminal domain or SABD-depleted extracts had disorganized microtubules, and NuMA was mislocalized (Fig. 3C). Therefore, depleting SABD- and C-terminal domain-containing 4.1 proteins disrupted spindle, centrosome aster, and self-organized microtubule aster assembly. The aberrant reconstitution of microtubule structures observed in depleted extracts could result either from loss of 4.1 function itself or from loss of an essential 4.1 protein binding partner co-depleted in the reaction. To address this issue we added back-purified recombinant 80-kDa 4.1R to depleted extracts. Strikingly, spindle, centrosome, and aster reconstitution was completely restored by supplementation with recombinant 4.1R in extracts depleted with either SABD or C-terminal domain IgGs, producing structures with morphology and NuMA distribution comparable with controls (Fig. 3, A′, B′, and C′). The rescue of assembly by recombinant 4.1R shows directly that protein 4.1 is essential for the assembly of mitotic spindles, centrosome, and self-organized microtubule asters. Furthermore, this result indicates that a single isoform containing both SABD and C-terminal domains is sufficient to mediate all of the functions of 4.1 necessary for its role in organizing mitotic microtubule arrays in Xenopus egg extracts. Dominant Negative 4.1 Peptides Distort Assembly of Spindles, Centrosomes, and Microtubule Asters in Vitro—Having established that 4.1 is required for proper formation of microtubule structures, we next wanted to test the functions of specific 4.1 domains in spindle, centrosome, and microtubule aster assembly. To this end we added to in vitro assembly reactions bacterially expressed peptides with amino acid sequences corresponding to 4.1 domains. We reasoned that the peptides might act competitively to disrupt 4.1 complexes or to sequester important 4.1 binding partners during the assembly process. We analyzed peptide effects both on morphology and localization of the 4.1 binding partner NuMA as another measure of functional disruption because in controls NuMA localized in a tight focus at spindle poles, in the pericentriolar area of centrosomes and at the centers of self-organized asters (Fig. 3). Initially we analyzed the effects of peptides related to 4.1 SABD and C-terminal domains. We focused on these domains because they (a) have important defined functions, (b) are highly conserved between frog and mammals, (c) were present in recombinant 4.1R used to rescue extracts immunodepleted by SABD and C-terminal domain IgGs, and (d) were demonstrated to profoundly distort nuclear assembly in vitro in egg extracts (19Krauss S.W.

For our experiments, we expressed His6-tagged peptides encoded by either exons 16-17 (amino acids 644-705) in the 4.1R spectrin-actin binding domain (SABD) or by exons 20-21 (amino acids 800-858) of the 4.1R C-terminal domain (Fig. 4). As controls for the SABD peptide, we used a variant 4.1N SABD peptide with low amino acid sequence homology to the 4.1R 16-17 peptide and a 4.1R 16-17ΔNF peptide with a deletion of two amino acids within its actin binding domain rendering it unable to bind actin but retaining spectrin binding. As a control for the 4.1R C-terminal domain peptide we used a C-terminal domain peptide in which three valines were changed to alanines, an alteration previously shown to reduce its binding affinity to NuMA Tail I fragment by ∼60-fold (19Krauss S.W.

Addition of the 4.1R 16-17 SABD peptide produced spindles with less focused microtubules at the poles and more dispersed NuMA in the peripolar area. Often there were multipolar structures. In these spindles, chromatin appeared less condensed at the metaphase plate (Fig. 5A, top row). Centrosome asters, while retaining a small central focus of NuMA staining, had only a few bundled microtubules radiating outward (Fig. 5A, middle row). Self-organized asters also appeared to contain bundled microtubules and had a very diffuse central area of NuMA with additional NuMA epitopes distributed along microtubule bundles (Fig. 5A, bottom row). However, an equal concentration of a deletion mutant in the 4.1R SABD peptide-(4.1R 16-17ΔNF) added to extracts did not affect the assembly of spindles, centrosomes, or asters with respect to the morphol"

Mutations to the receptor result in familial hypercholesterolemia, and over 60 of these occur in the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain pair. Two selected mutations in this region (G322S and R329P) were introduced into the domain pair and analyzed by in vitro refolding. Both exhibited differing levels of protein misfolding with R329P being the most pronounced. Solution NMR studies of the mutant domain pairs after purification established that a fraction of protein maintains a native-like fold and that this fraction contains two intact calcium-binding sites. An in vivo analysis of intact receptors containing these binding sites showed significantly reduced cell-surface expression compared with the native LDL receptor levels, again with R329P showing the most severe decrease. The sum of these results suggests that either local changes in structure or domain misfolding may be associated with the mutations. There is also the possibility that the misfolding of the calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like pair region is propagated to other regions of the intact receptor, resulting in more global defects. Surprisingly, for both mutants, those full-length receptors that fold and reach the cell surface retain the ability to bind LDL and release the ligand upon exposure to low pH. This analysis provides significant insight into the protein defect resulting from each of the two mutations and allows their classification to be 2B (partially transport-defective).

Receptor-ligand complexes enter the cell through endocytosis at clathrin-coated pits. The bound lipoprotein is released subsequently in the low pH environment of the endosome, and the receptors are recycled back to the cell surface (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar). Mutations to the LDL receptor (LDLR) are associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal-dominant inherited disease affecting ∼1 in 500 in most populations. FH is characterized clinically by a lifelong elevation of LDL-bound cholesterol in blood and is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and cardiovascular disease (2Goldstein J.L.

Such information is vitally important for attempts to correlate protein defects with protein dysfunction and ultimately with phenotype. The LDLR consists of a series of discrete extracellular protein modules responsible for the binding and release of lipoprotein ligands. The ligand-binding region is composed of a series of seven LDL receptor-type A (LA) modules followed by a region with a homology to the EGF precursor, an O-glycosylation region, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tail (11Brown M.S. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 629-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The EGF precursor-homology region consists of two calcium-binding EGF domains, six YWTD repeats forming a β-propeller domain, and a third EGF domain. Calcium is required for ligand binding (12Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Brown M.S.

Structure. 2001; 9: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) the structure of the calcium-saturated EGF-AB pair from the LDL receptor in which the two domains adopt an extended rod-like arrangement. At present, over 60 FH mutations have been localized to the EGF-AB pair. Based on our structure, it was possible to predict the structural consequences of some missense mutations, for example G352D, which was suggested to disrupt pairwise domain interactions, but the effects of other mutations were not as apparent based on the structural data alone (9Saha S. Boyd J. Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. Structure. 2001; 9: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this research, we have investigated the consequences of two mutations for which the structural consequences were not readily evident: Gly322→Ser (G322S) and Arg329→Pro (R329P). G322S has been classified previously as class 2B (partially transport-defective) or class 5 (recycling-deficient) (4Hobbs H.H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Hum. Mutat. 1992; 1: 445-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), whereas a mutation class has not been assigned to R329P (14Day I.N.M. Whittall R.A. O'Dell S.D. Haddad L. Bolla M.K. Gudnason V. Humphries S.E. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These two mutations were selected for a comparative study, because they each reduce the entropy of the backbone in the folded conformation and they are both located in turns at opposite ends of the minor β-hairpin of EGF-A. These observations suggest the possibility that the folding properties of the domain might be compromised (see Fig. 1). Here we demonstrate using the analysis of in vitro protein refolding, protein structure, and the calcium-binding properties of the EGF-AB pair that these two mutations are associated specifically with different degrees of protein misfolding. When cells lacking native LDL receptors are transfected stably with receptors harboring these mutations, the amount of folded receptors detected at the cell surface tightly correlates with the fraction of native-like folded receptors recovered from in vitro folding assays. Remarkably, the mutant receptors that do fold and reach the cell surface retain the ability to bind LDL, and the ability of the mutant receptors to release bound LDL upon exposure to low pH is not compromised when compared with native receptors. This research provides important insight into the protein defect associated with two mutations known to cause FH. A comparison of the differences in the refolding properties of the two mutants with respect to the blood cholesterol levels of patients suggests that the disease phenotype is influenced strongly by the extent of compromise that results from each individual mutation. In addition, these results may enable the prediction of the molecular defects associated with structurally similar disease-causing mutations to calcium-binding EGF-like domains in the LDLR and other proteins associated with human diseases such as human fibrillin-1 (15Robinson P.N. Godfrey M. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Expression Plasmids and Cell Lines—The plasmid construct for bacterial expression of the LDLR EGF-AB pair has been described previously (16Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inserts for the full-length native LDL receptor (WT) and the ΔEGFP mutant receptor, which lacks residues 293–693, were cloned into the vector pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) for mammalian cell expression. ldlA-7 cells, which lack endogenous LDL receptors (kindly provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (17Kingsley D.M. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5454-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar)) were transfected with each construct using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were selected with G418 (concentration: 1 mg/ml). Cell lines were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine supplemented with 4% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient bovine calf serum (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA) and 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Cambrex Bio Science Inc., Walkersville, WV). Cells were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The substitutions G322S and R329P were introduced individually into both the LDLR EGF-AB construct and full-length LDLR construct using overlap extension PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar, 19Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). The flanking primers used were as follows: pQE30, 5′-CGG ATA ACA ATT TCA CAC AG-3′, and pQE30, 5′-GTT CTG AGG TCA TTA CTG G-3′, for LDLR EGF-AB constructs and LDLR-fl-F, 5′-AGT GCA TCC ACT CCA GCT G-3′, and LFLR-fl-R, 5′-CTC TGG GAC AGG TCA GAC C-3′, for full-length LDLR constructs. The mutagenic primers used were as follows: G332S-F, 5′-CTG TGC CCC GAC AGC TTC-3′; G322S-R, 5′-GAA GCT GTC GGG GCA CAG-3′; R329P-F, 5′-GTG GCC CAG CCA AGA TGC-3′; and R329P-R, 5′-GCA TCT TGG CTG GGC CAC-3′. The PCR products from the overlap extension PCRs were restricted using HindIII and KpnI for the LDLR-AB construct (pQE30, Qiagen Ltd, West Sussex, United Kingdom) and EcoRI and Bsu36I for the full-length construct (pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO, Invitrogen) and ligated back into the appropriate vectors, replacing the WT sequence. The presence of each point mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Expression and Purification of AB Pairs—The EGF pair from LDLR (EGF-AB) was expressed and purified using a protocol described previously by Malby et al. (16Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The protein was expressed as a His tag fusion in Escherichia coli JM109 cells, either in LB media (for unlabeled samples) or in minimal media using 15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source (for 15N-labeled isotopically enriched samples). The expressed protein was extracted under denaturing conditions (6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.0) before being applied to a His tag affinity column containing cobalt resin (TALON™ CellThru, BD Biosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom) for initial purification and eluted into 6 m guanidine HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm imidazole. The sample was reduced with 0.1 m dithiothreitol in 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, prior to purification by reverse-phase HPLC. All of the HPLC analysis was performed on a BioCad Sprint (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A Poros Perfusion Chromatography R2/10 column (10/100 mm; Applied Biosystems) was used with an elution gradient of 2–60% of a buffer containing 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a rate of 3.9%/min using a flow rate of 8 ml/min prior to lyophilization. The His tag was removed as described previously (16Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Refolding Conditions—The protein was refolded by dialysis against a buffer containing 3 mm l-cysteine and 0.3 mm l-cystine in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.3, at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The protein for analysis was purified by two additional rounds of chromatography, anion-exchange HPLC, and reverse-phase HPLC and then analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry to confirm the presence of a single disulfide-bonded component of the correct mass. The AIEX HPLC was performed on a Poros Perfusion Chromatography HQ/M column (4.6/100 mm; Applied Biosystems) run at pH 7.5 and eluted using a gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl at a rate of 100 mm NaCl/min at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. The protein with a native or native-like fold eluted between 185 and 255 mm NaCl. This material was collected and then purified by RP-HPLC as described above using a Poros Perfusion Chromatography R2/10 column (4.6/100 mm) and an elution gradient of 2–60% of a buffer containing 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a rate of 5.2%/min with a flow rate of 3 ml/min prior to lyophilization. For refolding trials, equal quantities of protein, normalized spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient calculated as described previously (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar), were refolded simultaneously under the conditions specified above. The level of refolding was analyzed by RP-HPLC using a Poros Perfusion Chromatography R2/10 column (4.6/100 mm) with an elution gradient of 10–60% of a buffer containing 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a rate of 0.5%/min using a flow rate of 3 ml/min. The samples for RP-HPLC analysis were acidified (by the addition of 5% (v/v) acetic acid) to halt disulfide exchange after refolding prior to HPLC. Chromatograms were analyzed by peak integration using the BioCad software (Applied Biosystems) and cross-checked using manual peak integration in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). NMR Spectroscopy—All of the NMR data were acquired using General Electric/home-built instruments with triple resonance triaxial gradient probes operating at 600 MHz. Protein samples were assayed in 95% H2O, 5% 2H2O at pH 6.5 and 30 °C. WT, G322S, and R329P 15N-labeled samples were assayed at 0.18, 0.17, and 0.05 mm, respectively. The spectra recorded at calcium concentrations of 0, 10, and 12 mm demonstrated calcium-dependent displacement of cross-peaks and saturation of both sites at a calcium concentration of 10 mm. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra (21Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2408) Google Scholar) were acquired for each sample with 2048 by 128 complex points and with acquisition times of 102 ms in F2 and 78 ms in F1. The data were processed using Felix 97 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), typically using a 70° shifted squared sine-bell window function in F2 and a Kaiser window function with an 8 Kaiser parameter in F1. The spectra were referenced with respect to the H2HO resonance and zero-filled in the F2 dimension to produce spectra with a digital resolution of 4.88 Hz/point. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra (22Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms for the comparison of the WT and G322S samples. Each spectrum was acquired with 700 t1 increments of 2048 complex points and with a spectral width of 10,000 MHz. The data were processed using Felix 97 (Accelrys), typically using a 85° shifted sine-bell window function in F2 and using a 70° shifted squared sine-bell window function in F1. The spectra were referenced with respect to the H2HO resonance and zero-filled in the F2 dimension to produce spectra with a digital resolution of 2.44 Hz/point. Minimum chemical shift displacements in the HSQC spectra were measured as the distance between the assigned peak in the WT spectrum and the nearest peak in the spectrum of the mutant. Combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes were calculated using the Pythagorean theorem with 15N chemical shifts scaled by one-fourth relative to proton shifts. Chromophoric Chelator Measurement of Binding Constants—The calcium-binding properties of the EGF-AB pairs were determined using methods described previously (16Malby S. Pickering R. Saha S. Smallridge R. Linse S. Downing A.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Linse S. Johansson C. Brodin P. Grundstrom T. Drakenberg T. Forsen S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Purified protein samples, previously assessed by NMR in the presence of 12 mm calcium, were dialyzed sequentially against EDTA to 20 μm. To remove the EDTA, the samples were transferred into a calcium-free buffer containing 2 mm Tris·HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, using successive washes through a Microcon YM-3 centrifugation column (Millipore (UK) Ltd, Watford, United Kingdom) prewashed with the calcium-free buffer. All of the manipulations were carried out using disposable plasticware wherever possible to avoid calcium contamination. Absorbance scans and calcium titrations were performed using a dual-beam Lambda-40 UV-visible spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were prepared using the calcium-free buffer solution containing 25 μm 5,5′-Br2-BAPTA (C22H18Br2K4N2O10, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and 12.5 (±3) μm protein in a total volume of 0.9 ml. Protein concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis. The residual calcium concentration was determined to be 0.7 μm on the basis of Amax and Amin measurements for samples containing saturating EDTA or Ca2+, respectively. Protein and blank samples were titrated sequentially using 2 μl of the additions of a 2.55 mm CaCl2 solution (assayed by EDTA titrations using the murexide indicator) with a final addition of 2 μl of 1 m CaCl2 to complete saturation. The dissociation constant of the chelator was determined using the CaLigator software (24Andre I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using data from three blank titrations. Protein-binding constants for the two binding sites were determined using the CaLigator software (n = 2 for each sample). Variable parameters in the fits were the binding constants (K1 and K2), Amax, and Amin. Western Blotting—Whole cell extracts of ldlA-7 cells transfected with native and mutated LDL receptors were analyzed for expression by Western blotting. After SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transfer to nitrocellulose, receptors were detected either with monoclonal α-LDL receptor antibody IgG-C7 or IgG-4A4 followed by the addition of a secondary α-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Femto, Pierce, Rockford, IL). Flow-cytometric Analysis of Receptor Expression, Binding, and Release—Flow cytometry was performed using a Coulter Epics XL-MCL single-laser 4-color flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). Flow-cytometry data collected with the program EXPO32 ADC software (Beckman Coulter) were downloaded into the program winMDI (TSRI FACS Core Facility, La Jolla, CA) for analysis. The level of receptor expression was assessed by labeling with monoclonal α-LDL receptor antibody IgG-C7 followed by the addition of a secondary α-mouse antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. To evaluate LDL binding and release, ldlA-7 cells stably expressing native or mutant receptors were detached from dishes and fixed mildly with 0.5% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h. The fluorescent ligand DiI-LDL (Molecular Probes) then was added at a concentration of 7.5 μg/ml in pH 7.4 buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) and was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 4 °C. To test for low pH-induced ligand release, the pH was shifted to 5.3 by replacing the buffer with 25 mm Tris succinate, pH 5.3, containing 150 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2 followed by additional incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. DiI-LDL fluorescence then was determined by flow cytometry as noted above. Effects of G322S and R329P Mutations on Expression and Protein Folding—WT, G322S, and R329P samples of the EGF-AB pair were expressed in and purified from E. coli strain JM109 under identical conditions. Although the stability of recombinant protein expressed from E. coli is subject to a number of factors, both G322S and R329P consistently resulted in reduced expression levels of the EGF-AB pairs compared with WT (52 and 30%, respectively). The in vitro refolding ability of each EGF-AB pair was analyzed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2A). Equal quantities (1 mg) of each sample were refolded simultaneously under identical conditions established for the production of the natively folded WT EGF-AB pair. Samples were subjected to RP-HPLC, and the chromatograms were analyzed by peak integration. The percentage of protein for each sample that eluted under the same conditions as the natively folded WT EGF-AB pair corresponding to a retention time of 46–49.5 min (see Fig. 2A, inset) was determined with WT normalized to 100% (Fig. 2B). The integration of AIEX chromatograms obtained after the refolding of samples for NMR and calcium-binding analysis produced equivalent refolding levels for the two mutants (data not shown). The chromatograms obtained from the RP-HPLC analysis visibly display an increase of additional isomers for both G322S and R329P. Effects of G322S and R329P Mutations on the EGF-AB Structure by NMR—The effects of the G322S and R329P mutations on the protein fold were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. All of the mutant samples used purified material eluted from the AIEX HPLC under the equivalent conditions to the natively folded WT sample (185–255 mm NaCl). An additional final RP-HPLC step ensured that the analysis was performed on protein eluted as a single peak, corresponding to the native isomer for WT EGF-AB. The mass spectrometric analysis of these samples confirmed the presence of only a single component with all of the disulfide bonds formed. A comparison of the one-dimensional spectra of the calcium-saturated samples shows that the Hγ2* resonance of Thr-294 for each of the mutants is shifted to the same position as that for the WT (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Comparison of NMR data for the WT and mutant EGF-AB pairs. A, selected region of one-dimensional spectra of the LDLR EGF-AB pair acquired at 12 mm calcium. The position of the Thr-294 methyl chemical shift is indicated. B, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of calcium-saturated WT, G322S, and R329P EGF-AB pairs acquired at pH 6.5, 30 °C, and 600 MHz. NH resonances are labeled according to residue sequence number for main chain nitrogens and colored according to domain (blue for EGF-A and red for EGF-B). The NH2 side chain cross-peaks are shown boxed or joined by horizontal lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 1H 15N HSQC assignments for the backbone amides of the WT domain pair (9Saha S.

Structure. 2001; 9: 451-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were compared with cross-peak positions in the spectra of the two mutants (Fig. 3B). Both mutants display a similar dispersion to the WT EGF-AB pair. To spatially localize the extent of structural effects of the mutations, minimum chemical shift displacements were measured between assigned peaks in the WT spectrum to the nearest peak in the mutant spectrum. The combined 1H-15N chemical shift differences are displayed in Fig. 4A. Those residues manifesting chemical shift differences greater than 0.1 ppm are highlighted in Fig. 4B. The G322S mutation results in cross-peak displacement mainly for residues in the immediate vicinity of the mutation site. In contrast, R329P results in chemical shift changes for the majority of the residues in EGF-A. Because line broadening can arise as a consequence of conformational exchange, the backbone positions highlighted in Fig. 4B may differ structurally and/or dynamically in the mutants. Interdomain NOE connectivities conserved between the WT and G322S samples are highlighted in the inset to Fig. 4B, demonstrating a similar EGF domain arrangement. The same analysis for the R329P mutant was not possible because of the low recovery of the isolated product. The coexistence of multiple isoforms of the protein in solution would be expected to lead to a greater number of HSQC cross-peaks. The total number of HSQC cross-peaks is reduced marginally from the WT number (n = 113) for both G322S (n = 110) and R329P (n = 110), suggesting that both samples are homogeneous within the detection range of the NMR experiment, corresponding to a single disulfide-bonded isomer. All 12 cysteine residues in the G322S EGF-AB pair exhibit chemical shift perturbations of <0.12 ppm, indicative of native disulfide connectivity. The perturbations determined with the R329P mutant for the cysteines of the B-domain and the first disulfide cysteines of the A-domain (connectivity I–III) are <0.1 ppm. The II–IV disulfide cysteines show perturbations between 0.1 and 0.15 ppm, whereas the V–VI disulfide cysteines display perturbations between 0.2 and 0.5 ppm. These results suggest that the B-domain of the R329P mutant retains native disulfide connectivity. Chemical shift changes for the A domain II–IV and V–VI disulfide pairings in the R329P mutant spectrum may result from either localized structural and/or dynamic changes. G322S and R329P Ca"
https://openalex.org/W2092264582,"Plant α-dioxygenases (PADOX) are hemoproteins in the myeloperoxidase family. We have used a variety of spectroscopic, mutagenic, and kinetic approaches to characterize the heme environment in Arabidopsis thaliana PADOX-1. Recombinant PADOX-1 purified to homogeneity contained 1 mol of heme bound tightly but noncovalently per protein monomer. Electronic absorbance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and magnetic circular dichroism spectra showed a high spin ferric heme that could be reduced to the ferrous state by dithionite. Cyanide bound relatively weakly in the ferric PADOX-1 heme vicinity (Kd ∼10 mm) but did not shift the heme to the low spin state. Cyanide was a very strong inhibitor of the fatty acid oxygenase activity (Ki ∼5 μm) and increased the Km value for oxygen but not that for fatty acid. Spectroscopic analyses indicated that carbon monoxide, azide, imidazole, and a variety of substituted imidazoles did not bind appreciably in the ferric PADOX-1 heme vicinity. Substitution of His-163 and His-389 with cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, or methionine resulted in variable degrees of perturbation of the heme absorbance spectrum and oxygenase activity, consistent with His-389 serving as the proximal heme ligand and indicating that the heme has a functional role in catalysis. Overall, A. thaliana PADOX-1 resembles a b-type cytochrome, although with much more restricted access to the distal face of the heme than seen in most other myeloperoxidase family members, explaining the previously puzzling lack of peroxidase activity in the plant protein. PADOX-1 is unusual in that it has a high affinity, inhibitory cyanide-binding site distinct from the distal heme face and the fatty acid site.

Fatty acid α-dioxygenases are hemoproteins that have been found in many plants, including tobacco, thale cress (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice, pea, and cucumber (1Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and form one subfamily of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) 1The abbreviations used are: MPO, myeloperoxidase; PGHS, prostaglandin H synthase; PADOX, plant α-dioxygenase; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MnPPIX, mangano protoporphyrin IX; and Gdm, guanidinium HCl. family of proteins (2Daiyasu H. Toh H. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The cyclooxygenases, also known as prostaglandin H synthases (PGHSs), and linoleate diol synthase represent two other MPO hemoprotein subfamilies known to have fatty acid oxygenase activity (2Daiyasu H. Toh H. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The plant dioxygenases convert a variety of fatty acids to the corresponding 2-hydroperoxides (Reaction 1).R−CH2−COOH+O2→R−CH(OOH)−COOHREACTION 1 The 2-hydroperoxides undergo spontaneous decarboxylation to shorter aldehydes and fatty acids (3Hamberg M. Sanz A. Castresana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24503-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The plant dioxygenase reaction differs from plant lipoxygenases and the cyclooxygenases in that the oxygen addition does not target an unsaturated region in the fatty acid (1Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The initial fatty acid α-dioxygenase cloned from A. thaliana, termed PADOX-1 (for plant α dioxygenase-1), has about 20% amino acid identity with human PGHS-1 and -2 (4Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A second isoform (PADOX-2) has been proposed recently (1Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), based on analysis of A. thaliana and other plant cDNA sequences. In the absence of crystallographic information for any PADOX, structural models for MPO itself (5Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and the PGHS isoforms (6Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M.

Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) provide a starting point for elucidating structural features of the PADOX proteins. Many residues crucial for activity in mammalian PGHS isoforms are conserved in the PADOX proteins, including the histidine residue serving as proximal heme ligand and that near the distal heme face (e.g. His-388 and His-207, respectively, in ovine PGHS-1, and His-389 and His-163 in A. thaliana PADOX-1) (4Sanz A. Moreno J.I. Castresana C. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, substitution of glutamine for the putative proximal heme ligand in rice PADOX-1, His-383, did not abolish oxygenase activity (9Koeduka T. Matsui K. Akakabe Y. Kajiwara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22648-22655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that this histidine might not actually be the proximal heme ligand. Many other residues in the heme vicinity in the mammalian PGHS isoforms are not conserved in the plant α-oxygenases (Fig. 1), suggesting that the heme environment in the plant enzymes differs from those in other MPO family members. Differences in the heme environment between other MPO family members and the PADOX enzymes are also indicated by the lack of detectable peroxidase activity in all but one PADOX examined so far (1Hamberg M. Ponce de Leon I. Sanz A. Castresana C. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68-69: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and by the markedly different heme spectroscopic properties reported for rice PADOX-1 (9Koeduka T.

Given the importance of the heme in catalysis in other MPO subfamilies, especially in the fatty acid oxygenase activities of the PGH synthases and linoleate diol synthase (13Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 14Su C. Sahlin M. Oliw E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20744-20751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it was of considerable interest to better characterize the heme environment in the plant α-oxygenases. We have expressed recombinant A. thaliana PADOX-1 in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems to characterize the heme prosthetic group, its interaction with various ligands, and its connection with oxygenase catalysis.

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1988Google Scholar) were followed. Plasmid vectors pGEX-4T-1, pCW, and pVL1392 were used for DNA cloning, and E. coli DH5α cells were used for most in vivo DNA transformation experiments. Competent bacterial cells were prepared according to Inoue et al. (17Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1568) Google Scholar). Restriction fragments were purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Constructs for Bacterial Expression—Construction of expression plasmid for GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein used PCR from a plasmid containing the A. thaliana PADOX-1 cDNA (218B16T7) and two primers: 5′-GATGAAAGTAATTACTTCCCTAATCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCTCGAGTTAAGAGGGAATTCGGAGATAG-3′ (antisense). The anti-sense primer added an XhoI site (underlined) after the stop codon. The 1.9-kb product was digested with XhoI and inserted in pGEX-4T-1 to give the pGEX-aP10 vector, whose integrity was confirmed by sequencing. pGEX-aP10 was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells, and colonies were selected with ampicillin and chloramphenicol. Construction of expression plasmid for full-length PADOX-1 protein used PCR from the 218B16T7 plasmid and two primers: 5′-GGTCATATGAAAGTAATTACTTCCCTAATCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTCTAGACAAATTAAGAGGGAATTCGGA-3′ (antisense). The sense primer introduced the initiation codon within an NdeI site (underlined). The antisense primer added an XbaI site (underlined) after the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XbaI and ligated into the pCW vector. The plasmid was sequenced and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations were introduced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the pGEX-aP10 expression plasmid with the following primer pairs (altered bases underlined): H163C sense, 5′-GGATTCAGTTCATGATCTGTGATTGGATTGATC-3′, and H163C antisense, 5′-GATCAATCCAATCACAGATCATGAACTGAATCC-3′; H163M sense, 5′-GATTCAGTTCATGATCATGGATTGGATTGATCATC-3′, and H163M antisense, 5′-GATGATCAATCCAATCCATGATCATGAACTGAATC-3′; H163Q sense, 5′-GGATTCAGTTCATGATCCAGGATTGGATTGATC-3′, and H163Q antisense, 5′-GATCAATCCAATCCTGGATCATGAACTGAATCC-3′; H163Y sense, 5′-GGATTCAGTTCATGATCTACGATTGGATTGATCATC-3′, and H163Y antisense, 5′-GATGATCAATCCAATCGTAGATCATGAACTGAATCC-3′; Y386F sense, 5′-GATTTCACCAGCGTCTTTCGAATGCATTCTCTC-3′, and Y386F antisense, 5′-GAGAGAATGCATTCGAAAGACGCTGGTGAAATC-3′; R387H sense, 5′-CACCAGCGTCTATCATATGCATTCTCTCTTACC-3′, and R387H antisense, 5′-GGTAAGAGAGAATGCATATGATAGACGCTGGTG-3′; H389C sense, 5′-CAGCGTCTATCGAATGTGTTCTCTCTTACCTG-3′, and H389C antisense, 5′-CAGGTAAGAGAGAACACATTCGATAGACGCTG-3′; H389M sense, 5′-CAGCGTCTATCGAATGATGTCTCTCTTACCTGATC-3′, and H389M antisense, 5′-GATCAGGTAAGAGAGACATCATTCGATAGACGCTG-3′; H389Q sense, 5′-CAGCGTCTATCGAATGCAGTCTCTCTTACCTG-3′, and H389Q antisense, 5′-CAGGTAAGAGAGACTGCATTCGATAGACGCTG-3′; H389Y sense, 5′-CAGCGTCTATCGAATGTACTCTCTCTTACCTGATC-3′, and H389Y antisense, 5′-GATCAGGTAAGAGAGAGTACATTCGATAGACGCTG-3′. E. coli strain XL-10 cells were transformed with the PCR product. Plasmid DNA was isolated from ampicillin-resistant colonies, screened by sequencing, and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression of Recombinant PADOX-1 Proteins in Bacteria—Cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C in medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol to an A610 of 0.7. After chilling to 23 °C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) and δ-aminolevulinic acid (0.5 mm) were added, and culture was continued for 16 h at 23 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C. Expression of PADOX-1 Protein in Insect Cells—A 1.9-kb fragment containing PADOX-1 cDNA was generated by PCR using the 218B16T7 plasmid and the following primer pair, sense 5′-GACTGCAGGCCACCATGAAAGTAATTACTTCCCT-3′ and antisense 5′-GCTCTAGACAAATTAAGAGGGAATTCGGA-3′. These primers incorporated an upstream Kozak sequence (GCCACC) to optimize translation (18Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and removed the 3′-untranslated region. The resulting 1.9-kb DNA was digested with PstI and XbaI, ligated into the pVL1392 vector, and used to transform E. coli DH5α cells. Transfer vector plasmid (PADOX/pVL1392) isolated from an ampicillin-resistant colony was verified by restriction digests and sequencing. For generation of recombinant baculovirus, adherent Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the PADOX/pVL1392 transfer vector and BaculoGold linearized baculovirus DNA, following the manufacturer's instructions. For production of recombinant PADOX-1 protein, Sf9 cells were grown in suspension at 27 °C to a density of 1.0-1.5 ×106 cells/ml. Recombinant baculovirus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10, and culture was continued for 4 days. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.8, 0.1% Tween 20 and disrupted by sonication. The sonicates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the sonication procedure was repeated with the pellets. The combined supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to obtain a clarified supernatant with >95% of the total fatty acid oxygenase activity. Purification of Recombinant PADOX-1 and GST-PADOX-1 Proteins Expressed in Bacteria—Purification was performed at 4 °C; the pH of each buffer was 7.8, and each buffer contained 0.05% Tween 20 unless otherwise specified. Cell pellets (20 g wet weight, from 5 liters of culture medium) were resuspended in 100 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl containing 0.2% Tween 20, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm bestatin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 20 μm leupeptin, and 20 μm chymostatin, frozen at -70 °C, thawed, and disrupted by sonication. Nuclease (0.5 units/ml) was added, and the material was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was brought to 30% saturation with 5.2 m (NH4)2SO4, 5 mm EDTA, and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. After discarding the pellet, the (NH4)2SO4 concentration of the supernatant was raised to 65% saturation before centrifuging again at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Precipitated proteins were solubilized by stirring with 50 ml of lysis buffer on ice for 1 h and then dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration. For purification of PADOX-1, the concentrated material was applied to a Sephacryl 300 HR column (2.5 × 90 cm) and eluted at 12 ml/h with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA; active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. For purification of the GSTPADOX-1, the concentrated material was applied to a GSH-agarose column (2.5 × 10 cm), washed with 5 volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl and 10 volumes of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and eluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 15 mm GSH. Active, orange-colored fractions containing GST-PADOX-1 were pooled, concentrated, and then chromatographed on the Sephacryl 300 HR column as described above for PADOX-1. Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as the standard (19Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Oxygenase Activity Assay—Fatty acid oxygenase activity was determined at 30 °C using a YSI Inc. model 53 oxygen monitor (Yellow Springs, MD). Each reaction contained 3 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, with 100 μm fatty acid and was started by injection of enzyme. One unit of oxygenase activity gives a velocity of 1 nmol of O2/min. Inhibition of oxygenase activity was measured by adding test compounds to the assay before the enzyme or by preincubating the enzyme with the test compound for 1 h at 4 °C prior to assay. Km and Vmax values were estimated by measuring oxygenase velocity with 5-300 μm fatty acid or 15-1100 μm oxygen and fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Electrophoretic Analysis—Proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibody against GST (21Kulmacz R.J. Wu K.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 268: 502-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Heme Quantification—Heme concentrations were determined from the reduced pyridine hemochrome, using an extinction coefficient difference (A556-A538) of 24.5 mm-1 cm-1 (22Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.L. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10524-10531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme Extraction—This was carried out at 4 °C by a slight modification of Teale's method (23Teale F.W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 35: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Purified PADOX-1 was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and diluted to ∼25 μm (∼2.5 mg/ml) with water. The pH was adjusted to 4.6 with 0.1 m HCl, and the solution was mixed with an equal volume of 2-butanone. Alternatively, the enzyme solution, pH 7.8, was directly mixed with an equal volume of butanone. In either case, the mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged to separate the orange colored organic phase containing the heme from the colorless lower aqueous phase containing apoprotein. The aqueous phase was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to remove residual butanone and centrifuged to remove precipitate; heme was added before assay of oxygenase activity. UV-visible Absorbance Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu model 2101 PC dual beam spectrophotometer or an HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer. For examination of reduced enzyme, each sample was placed in a titrator cuvette and made anaerobic by five cycles of evacuation and argon replacement before addition of sodium dithionite solution with a syringe (24Williams Jr., C.H. Arscott L.D. Matthews R.G. Thorpe C. Wilkinson K.D. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The reductant solution was prepared by dissolving solid dithionite powder in 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.8; the sodium dithionite concentration was determined using lumiflavin-3-acetic acid (25Foust G.P. Burleigh Jr., B.D. Mayhew S.G. Williams Jr., C.H. Massey V. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For titrations, spectra were recorded several minutes after each addition of ligand; equilibration was periodically confirmed by recording a second scan after an additional few minutes. Examination of Absorbance Changes during Reaction of GST PADOX-1 with Fatty Acid—The purified fusion protein (1 μm heme) in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.8, with 0.025% Tween 20 at 22 °C was mixed with an ethanolic solution of 18:3n-3 (final concentrations: 20 μm 18:3n-3, 0.7% ethanol). Fatty acid consumption and absorbance changes were monitored in parallel reactions. For quantitation of fatty acid, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.10 volumes of 1.2 m HCl, 0.016 volumes of 4.1 mm 15:0 (internal standard) and 50 mg of NaCl. Lipids were extracted with 3 volumes of toluene/ethyl acetate (1:1), transferred to screw cap vials, and the solvent evaporated under a stream of nitrogen gas. Fatty acids were derivatized with pyrenyl diazomethane (26Nimura N. Kinoshita T. Yoshida T. Uetake A. Nakai C. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2067-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Derivatized samples were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography on a Rainin Microsorb C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm) eluted at 1.5 ml/min with 95% methanol. The eluate was monitored by A340 (the 15:0 and 18:3n-3 derivatives eluted at 18.9 and 13.3 min, respectively). The 18:3n-3 concentration was calculated by multiplying the ratio of the high pressure liquid chromatography peak areas for the 18:3n-3 and 15:0 derivatives by the concentration of 15:0 added to the enzyme reaction. For quantitation of absorbance changes, enzyme and fatty acid were reacted in a quartz cuvette. EPR and MCD Spectroscopy—EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX EPR spectrometer at liquid helium or liquid nitrogen temperature. The liquid helium system included an Oxford GFS 600 transfer line, an ITC 503 temperature controller, and an ESR 900 cryostat. The liquid nitrogen system included a BVT 3000 temperature controller. Quantitation was done by double integration with reference to a copper standard (22Kulmacz R.J. Tsai A.L. Palmer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10524-10531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MCD spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter equipped with a 1.3-tesla electromagnet. Expression of Recombinant A. thaliana PADOX-1 in Bacteria and Insect Cells—Recombinant PADOX-1 protein was expressed in active form in both prokaryotic (E. coli) and eukaryotic (Sf9 insect cells) systems. The yield of functional enzyme per liter of culture was about 10-fold higher for a GSTPADOX-1 fusion protein expressed in a bacterial system than for full-length PADOX expressed in either bacteria or insect cells. Thus, bacterial expression of the recombinant GSTPADOX-1 fusion protein was chosen as the primary method to prepare enzyme for characterization. A typical yield of the fusion protein (at the crude extract stage) was 34 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Most of the fatty acid oxygenase activity of GST-PADOX-1 expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells was recovered in the 10,000 × g supernatant after homogenization. The GSTPADOX-1 fusion protein tended to aggregate, and several detergents were tested for their ability to minimize aggregation without inhibiting the enzyme. Tween 20 (0.2%) was found to be effective and was routinely added during purification. After undergoing a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, dialysis, affinity chromatography, and gel filtration, the fusion protein preparation showed a single prominent SDS-PAGE band at 98 kDa (data not shown), very close to the predicted mass of 99 kDa (27 kDa for GST plus 72 kDa for PADOX-1). The fatty acid oxygenase specific activity of purified GSTPADOX-1 was typically around 11 μmol of O2/min/mg of protein, with a pH optimum near 7.8. The enzyme utilized a variety of fatty acids of 18 carbons or less, with linolenate (18:3n-3), linoleate (18:2n-6), and oleate (18:1n-9) showing the highest activity and Km values of 15-20 μm. 2W. Liu and P. Fabian, unpublished results. Routine PADOX-1 assays used 18:2n-6 to maximize activity and minimize oxidative decomposition of the stock substrate. Thrombin digestion of the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein released full-length PADOX-1 that could be purified by gel filtration and that migrated as a 72-kDa species when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The UV-visible absorbance spectra of several such batches of PADOX-1 had Soret peaks at 413-415 nm, quite similar to the Soret peak position of 412-414 nm observed with the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein, and the Soret peak position of 410-412 nm observed for enzyme was expressed as a full-length protein without the GST domain (Table I). Further comparison of the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein with PADOX-1 released by thrombin and with PADOX-1 expressed without the GST domain showed the three preparations had very similar values for the oxygenase Km for oleic acid, the oxygenase Ki for cyanide, and the dissociation constant for cyanide calculated from spectrophotometric titrations, all described in more detail below (Table I). The close similarity of these several indices demonstrated that the presence of the GST fusion partner did not markedly affect the catalytic functioning or the heme environment of recombinant PADOX-1. However, PADOX-1 released by thrombin digestion lost activity more quickly during handling and storage than did the fusion protein, which retained almost 90% of its activity even after 6 months storage at 4 °C. This indicated that retaining the GST fusion partner considerably improved the stability of recombinant PADOX-1. Accordingly, the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein was used for most of the detailed characterization (GST itself does not have fatty acid oxygenase activity or interfering chromophores).Table IComparison of properties of PADOX-1 with and without GST fusion domainRecombinant proteinKm (18:1n-9)Ki (NaCN)aDetermined with 100 μm 18:3n-3 as substrate.Kd (NaCN)bDetermined from shifts in the heme Soret absorbance peak in titrations with NaCN.Soret peakcRanges indicate the variation observed in at least four measurements for each recombinant protein.μmμmmmposition (nm)GST-PADOX-1dExpressed in E. coli.19 ± 44.9 ± 0.612.9 ± 2.1412-414PADOX-1eCleaved from the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein by thrombin and purified by gel filtration.14 ± 44.6 ± 0.98.2 ± 1.6413-415PADOX-1fExpressed in E. coli without a GST domain, using the pCW vector.24 ± 53.2 ± 0.414.3 ± 2.3410-412a Determined with 100 μm 18:3n-3 as substrate.b Determined from shifts in the heme Soret absorbance peak in titrations with NaCN.c Ranges indicate the variation observed in at least four measurements for each recombinant protein.d Expressed in E. coli.e Cleaved from the GST-PADOX-1 fusion protein by thrombin and purified by gel filtration.f Expressed in E. coli without a GST domain, using the pCW vector.

Cessation of activity was due to substrate depletion, as full oxygenase activity resumed if additional substrate was provided (data not shown). Oxygenase catalysis by PADOX-1 thus showed little indication of the self-inactivation characteristic of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase catalysis (29Smith W.L. Lands W.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2030495150,"In the present report, using vibrational spectroscopy we have probed the ligand-protein interactions for full agonists (glutamate and α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)) and a partial agonist (kainate) in the isolated ligand-binding domain of the GluR2 subunit of the glutamate receptor. These studies indicate differences in the strength of the interactions of the α-carboxylates for the various agonists, with kainate having the strongest interactions and glutamate having the weakest. Additionally, the interactions at the α-amine group of the agonists have also been probed by studying the environment of the non-disulfide-bonded Cys-425, which is in close proximity to the α-amine group. These investigations suggest that the interactions at the α-amine group are stronger for full agonists such as glutamate and AMPA as evidenced by the increase in the hydrogen bond strength at Cys-425. Partial agonists such as kainate do not change the environment of Cys-425 relative to the apo form, suggesting weak interactions at the α-amine group of kainate. In addition to probing the ligand environment, we have also investigated the changes in the secondary structure of the protein. Results clearly indicate that full agonists such as glutamate and AMPA induce similar secondary structural changes that are different from those of the partial agonist kainate; thus, a spectroscopic signature is provided for identifying the functional consequences of a specific ligand binding to this protein.

Glutamate receptors are the predominant mediators of excitatory synaptic signals in the central nervous system (1Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev.

These receptors form cation-specific channels on binding glutamate and later enter a desensitized state in which the channel is closed, despite the presence of an agonist. Significant insights into the mechanism of agonist-induced activation and desensitization of this receptor have been obtained from the recent x-ray structures of the isolated, extracellular ligand-binding domain (S1S2) of the α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate; GluR2, glutamic acid receptor 2; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared. subtype of the glutamate receptors (6Armstrong N.

Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the S1S2 protein indicate a bilobed structure with the ligand-binding site located in the cleft between the lobes. The protein exists in an open structure in the apo state and undergoes varying degrees of cleft closure on binding various agonists. This cleft closure is believed to be a rigid body motion of one lobe relative to the other. Furthermore, the degree of lobe closure has been shown to be directly proportional to the extent of activation of these receptors, suggesting cleft closure in the S1S2 protein as the mechanism of activation of the receptor (7Hogner A. Kastrup J.S. Jin R. Liljefors T. Mayer M.L. Egebjerg J. Larsen I.K. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the S1S2 protein in various ligated states have provided the first structural insights into the structure-function correlations in the glutamate receptor. These insights, however, are low temperature static images that are limited by the constraints of crystal-packing forces. For a more detailed investigation of specific interactions, it becomes essential to complement these x-ray structures with spectroscopic investigations that probe the dynamic state of the protein with significantly higher resolution. Recent NMR studies, for instance, suggest that the protein is not a rigid structure and that domain 2 of the S1S2 protein, which interacts with the γ substituents of the agonists, exhibits considerable mobility on the microsecond to millisecond time scale (5McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 428-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E.

NMR. 2002; 22: 297-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because this region of the protein is directly connected to the transmembrane segments, these dynamic motions are expected to be involved in the subtleties of channel gating. These results suggest that the mode of agonist-induced activation may be more complex than the rigid body domain closure suggested by x-ray structures. The complexity of the allosteric mechanism of agonist action in glutamate receptors is further exemplified in investigations of the GluR4-S1S2 protein by using vibrational spectroscopic studies, which allow a detailed analysis of specific noncovalent interactions of the full and partial agonists and antagonists of the glutamate receptor (12Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Madden D.R. Thiran S. Zimmermann H. Romm J. Jayaraman V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37821-37826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have performed a similar investigation using the GluR2-S1S2 protein, which allows us to compare the vibrational spectroscopic data with the x-ray and NMR structures that were obtained using this protein (7Hogner A. Kastrup J.S. Jin R. Liljefors T. Mayer M.L. Egebjerg J. Larsen I.K. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Jin R. Banke T.G. Mayer M.L. Traynelis S.F. Gouaux E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Additionally, the signal to noise ratio of the spectra has also been improved. This improvement allows a more detailed quantitative analysis of the differences in the strength of the interactions of the α-carboxylates of the various ligands with the protein, which have not been observed in the crystal structures. The higher resolution of the vibrational spectra also indicates changes at the single non-disulfide-bonded Cys residue, which is in close proximity to the α-amine groups of the agonists and is, therefore, an indirect probe of the strength of the interactions between this group of agonists and the protein. The differences that occur between the interactions of the protein and the α substituents of the various agonists (glutamate, AMPA, and kainate) contribute to differences in affinity and most likely would also be factors in the observed differences in the degree of domain closure induced by these ligands and thus play a role in the differences in activation/function. Protein Preparation and Characterization—The plasmid S1S2J, used to express the GluR2-S1S2 protein, was kindly provided by Eric Gouaux (Columbia University, New York). The GluR2-S1S2 protein was expressed, purified, and characterized as described by Armstrong et al. (14Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5736-5741Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In brief, the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami-B(DE3) cells. Following clarification and concentration, the cell culture supernatant was purified by ion exchange chromatography (nickelnitrilotriacetic acid) column. His tag was removed by thrombin digestion and separated by using a SP-Sepharose column. The E705D mutant was obtained by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and expressed and purified using the same methodology as outlined for GluR2-S1S2 wild type protein. 0.25–0.5 mm protein in 25 mm phosphate buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and 0.02% NaN3 was used for the FTIR measurements. D2O was used as the solvent to obtain the spectra in the 1450–1800-cm-1 region because water has a large infrared absorption band at ∼1600 cm-1. For studying the SH stretching vibration, however, water was used as the solvent. FTIR-Difference Spectroscopy—The FTIR spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 spectrometer. A modified variable length sample holder (Aldrich) with CaF2 windows was used to obtain the spectra. Spectra were collected at 4-cm-1 spectral resolution and at a constant temperature of 15 °C. A 50-μm path length was used to obtain the spectra in the 1450–1800 cm-1 region, and a 75-μm path length was used for studying the SH vibration. The difference spectra were generated by subtracting the spectra of the unligated form from the spectra of the ligated form of the protein. The subtraction was performed using the band at 2045 cm-1 arising from the sodium azide present in the buffer as an internal standard. Furthermore, the peaks that arise from the unbound agonists were subtracted using a spectrum of the agonist in D2O. Ligand-binding Environment—The difference spectrum between the glutamate-bound and unligated forms of the protein is shown in Fig. 1 (trace A). To identify the frequencies of the asymmetric carboxylate (νasym) vibrations of the bound glutamate, infrared spectra were obtained in the presence and absence of S1S2 using isotopically labeled glutamate. The difference spectra between protein bound to glutamate and protein bound to glutamate labeled with 13C at the α-carboxylate and γ-carboxylate (12Jayaraman V. Keesey R. Madden D.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8693-8697Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) positions are shown in Fig. 1, traces B and C, respectively. The difference spectra between the unlabeled and labeled carboxylates exhibit positive and negative bands that can be used to assign the peaks. The positive features arise from the unlabeled carboxylate, and the negative features arise from the 13C-labeled carboxylate; hence, the positive feature in Fig. 1, trace B, represents the νasymα mode, whereas the positive feature in Fig. 1, trace C, represents the νasymγ mode. Comparing the frequencies of these modes to those of the unbound glutamate in buffer (Fig. 1, trace D) (Table I), it is clear that the νasymα mode is down-shifted by 4 cm-1, and the νasymγ mode is up-shifted by 11 cm-1 on binding to S1S2.Table IThe asymmetric carboxylate vibrations of the α↑ and γ-carboxylatesLigandνasymα (cm-1)νasymγ (cm-1)/isoxazoleFreeBound to S1S2FreeBound to S1S2Glutamate16141610 (-1.3 kcal)15651576 (3.7 kcal)Kainate16201602 (-6 kcal)1570Not assignedAMPA16141605 (-3 kcal)16591660 (tentative)Glutamate (E705D)16141608 (-2 kcal)15651558 (-2.3 kcal) Open table in a new tab The frequency of the asymmetric carboxylate stretching vibration is extremely sensitive to the overall electrostatic environment of the carboxylate and has been shown to exhibit a linear dependence on the strength of the noncovalent interactions at this moiety, with a 3-cm-1 downshift corresponding to a -1-kcal change in enthalpy at the carboxylate (15Cheng Q. Thiran S. Yernool D. Gouaux E. Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on these studies, the 4-cm-1 downshift in the α-carboxylate mode of glutamate on binding to the GluR2-S1S2 indicates a favorable -1.3 kcal/mol interaction for this moiety in the protein, relative to D2O. This observation is consistent with the crystal structures of GluR2-S1S2, (6Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar) that indicate the presence of a positively charged arginine (Arg-485) within hydrogen-bonding distance to the α-carboxylate of the glutamate. Conversely, an 11-cm-1 upshift observed in the γ-carboxylate vibrational mode of glutamate on binding S1S2 suggests that the interactions of the ligand glutamate at this carboxylate are unfavorable relative to that in D2O (Δhydrogen ∼ 3.6 kcal/mol). The x-ray structures of GluR2-S1S2 in complex with glutamate show two possible hydrogen bond donors (Ser-654 and Thr-655) and a negatively charged side chain (Glu-705, unfavorable interaction) in close proximity to the γ-carboxylate (6Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of residue Glu-705, a difference FTIR spectrum was obtained for the E705D mutant in the presence and absence of glutamate (Fig. 2). Additionally, the frequency of the νasymγ mode was established using the 13C-labeled glutamate at the γ position (Fig. 2, trace B). The FTIR spectra indicate a 7-cm-1 downshift in the νasymγ mode for the glutamate bound to the E705D mutant, relative to the free glutamate frequency (Table I). This downshift suggests that the unfavorable interactions at the γ-carboxylate of glutamate bound to the wild type protein is eliminated in the E705D mutant. Therefore, a downshift is observed in the frequency of the νasymγ mode, which could arise because of the favorable interactions with the two possible hydrogen bond donors (Ser-654 and Thr-655). The environments of the carboxylate moieties have also been investigated for the ligand kainate and AMPA by obtaining similar difference FTIR spectra of free ligand and ligand bound to the S1S2 protein (Fig. 3). Based on the α-carbon substituent effect on the carboxylate frequency (17Spinner E. J. Chem. Soc. B. 1967; : 874-879Crossref Google Scholar) and the observed frequencies for the carboxylate vibrational modes of amino acids, the νasymα and νasymγ/isoxazole modes have been assigned for kainate and AMPA (shown in Table I). These assignments indicate that the frequency of the νasymα band is down-shifted by 18 cm-1 in bound kainate, relative to its frequency in free kainate, and by 9 cm-1 in bound AMPA, relative to its frequency in free AMPA. The S1S2-induced downshift in the νasymα mode follows the order kainate > AMPA > glutamate. It can be concluded, therefore, that the hydrogen bond strength to the arginine residue in the protein follows the same order, namely, kainate > AMPA > glutamate. The x-ray structures indicate identical environments for the α substituents (amine and carboxylate groups) of the agonists glutamate, kainate, and AMPA, leading to the conclusions that this region of the protein is rigid and functions as a lock and key fit. The vibrational spectra, however, show that the strength of the interactions of the α-carboxylates of the agonists with the GluR2-S1S2 is different for the various agonists, with the difference in enthalpy of 4.7 kcal between the strongest (kainate) and weakest (glutamate) interactions. This suggests that, in the dynamic state of the protein, the α substituents of the agonists undergo slight adjustments to the lock and key fit for the various agonists and these small variations play a role in the differences in the affinity and function associated with these agonists. Protonation State of the α-Amine Group of Glutamate in the Ligand-binding Pocket—The frequency of the α-carboxylate group acts not only as a probe of the noncovalent interactions at this moiety but can also be used as an indicator for the protonation state of the α-amine group of the ligand. As shown in Fig. 1, traces D and E, the frequency of the α-carboxylate is significantly up-shifted (1614 cm-1) from the typical frequencies of the asymmetric carboxylate vibrational mode (1565 cm-1) only when the α-amine group is positively charged. When the pH is increased such that the α-amine group is deprotonated, the frequency of the α-carboxylate is similar to that of the γ-carboxylate, and the bands for the two moieties overlap (Fig. 1, trace E). Because the frequency of the asymmetric stretching vibration of the α-carboxylate of glutamate bound to S1S2 protein is at 1610 cm-1, closer to the 1614-cm-1 value of the free glutamate, it can be concluded that the α-amine group of the ligand glutamate is protonated in the protein. The implication of this observation is that the amine group can be involved in three donor hydrogen bonds, and there are a number of groups (Glu-705, Pro-478, and Thr-480) within hydrogen bonding distance in the x-ray structure that can be the hydrogen bond acceptors. Additionally, the positive charge on the α-amine group would have favorable electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged Glu-705 residue, thus justifying the position of the Glu-705 residue, despite unfavorable interactions with the γ-carboxylate of the ligand glutamate. Conformational Differences between the Partial and Full Agonist-bound Forms of S1S2—The crystal structures of the GluR2-S1S2 protein indicate that the degree of domain closure exhibits a linear dependence on the extent of activation of the channel. For instance, the protein S1S2 in complex with the partial agonist kainate exhibited intermediate closure of the cleft, whereas full agonists such as glutamate and AMPA exhibited larger closure. To identify analogous correlations between the conformational and functional changes in the infrared signals, we have investigated the secondary structure changes using amide I signals and probed the environment of the single non-disulfide-bonded cysteine residue in S1S2, using the SH stretching mode. Secondary Structure—The features at 1673, 1643, and 1630 cm-1 in the difference spectrum between the glutamate-bound and unligated forms of the protein (Fig. 4, top trace), are characteristic of amide I modes rising from the protein backbone. Based on the frequencies, the 1673 and 1630 cm-1 features can be assigned to changes in turns and β-sheet secondary structures, respectively (18Spiro T.G. Biological Applications of Raman Spectroscopy. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar). On the other hand, the feature at the 1643-cm-1 frequency could arise from changes in random structures (19Byler D.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar), irregular β-sheet (20Koenig J.L. Tabb D.L. Durig J.R. Analytical Applications of FT-IR to Molecular and Biological Systems. R. Deidel Publishing Co., Boston, Massachusetts1980: 241-255Crossref Google Scholar), and/or solvent-exposed helices (21Chapman D. Jackson M. Haris P.I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 617-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The difference features observed on glutamate binding to GluR2-S1S2 are also observed in the difference spectrum because of AMPA binding to the protein (Fig. 4, middle trace). This indicates that the conformational changes induced by AMPA binding to GluR2-S1S2 are similar to those resulting from glutamate binding. Therefore, these difference features in the amide I region could be used as a signature for full agonism. On the other hand, the difference features caused by the binding of partial agonist kainate are significantly more varied compared with those caused by glutamate and AMPA. Although the increase in intensity of the band arising from the β-sheet secondary structure on binding kainate is similar in magnitude to that observed for full agonist binding, the frequency of this mode is lower (1625 cm-1versus 1630 cm-1). Additionally, no differences are observed at 1643 cm-1 on kainate binding to GluR2-S1S2, unlike the case for full agonists, and a new feature is observed at 1650 cm-1. Based on the frequency, the features at 1650 cm-1 can be assigned to perturbations in α-helical structures. Overall, these results indicate that the perturbations in the protein backbone are different for full agonists versus partial agonists. The exact nature of these differences, in terms of structural changes in the protein, however, cannot be determined without further experiments in which the backbone carbonyls of specific parts of the protein are isotopically labeled. Irrespective of the differences in specific frequencies, the binding of all three ligands leads to an increase in intensities at specific frequencies, with no concomitant negative features resulting from a loss in specific types of secondary structure. This indicates that the observed changes caused by agonist binding do not arise because of conversion from one type of secondary structures to another, e.g. α-helices to random coil, but because of changes in the molar absorptivities of the specific secondary structural changes. Such changes in molar absorptivities reflect changes in the dipole moment arising from the small reorientation of the carbonyl groups in the backbone. The reorientation of the carbonyl groups could reflect changes in the dynamics of the protein on agonist binding. This would be consistent with the NMR structure of the glutamate-bound form of S1S2 that indicates interesting dynamics of specific β-sheet, α-helical, and turn structures, which has been suggested to be a possible pathway for channel gating (10McFeeters R.L. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10472-10481Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A more detailed comparison between the results observed here and the dynamics of the protein should be possible once the NMR structures of the various ligated states of GluR2-S1S2 are available. Environment of Cys-425 in S1S2—The SH stretching vibration of the non-disulfide-bonded cysteines (Cys-425 and Cys-436) in GluR2-S1S2 protein was monitored for the unligated and kainate-, glutamate-, and AMPA-bound forms in H2O (Fig. 5). Each band is deconvoluted into two bands using a Gaussian-Lorentzian mixed function. The band at 2560 cm-1 in the apo form of the protein has been assigned to Cys-425 based on vibrational spectroscopic investigations of GluR4-S1S2, which has only one free cysteine residue (Cys-426; SH stretching mode at 2563 cm-1), whereas the low intensity band at 2550 cm-1 has been assigned to Cys-436. The frequency of the SH stretching band at 2560 cm-1 for the Cys-425 residue in the unligated state (Fig. 5, trace A) indicates that the SH group forms a donor hydrogen bond of medium strength. Based on the GluR2 crystal structure, the possible hydrogen bond acceptor atoms that are closest to this Cys residue are the carbonyl oxygen atoms of Ala-477 or Ile-476, which are at a distance of ∼4 Å from the cysteine sulfur atom. Because the ∼4-Å distance is larger than that expected for a medium strength hydrogen bond at Cys-425, it is most likely that in the dynamic state of the protein the hydrogen bonding partner for Cys-425 (Ala-477 or Ile-476) is closer than the 4-Å distance observed in the crystal structure. The SH stretching frequency for Cys-436, on the other hand, is at 2550 cm-1, which is indicative of a strong donor hydrogen bond (6Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure, the backbone carbonyl of Ala-745 is 3.3 Å from the Cys-436 and, hence, the most likely hydrogen bond partner. The orientation of the possible hydrogen bond partners for Cys-425 and Cys-436 also accounts for the intensity differences observed for the two (6Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The torsion angle between SH (the O group of the hydrogen bonding partner was chosen to determine the SH bond) and Cβ-Cα (α and β with respect to the peptidyl CO) bonds are 130° and 67° for Cys-425 and Cys-436, respectively. These torsion angles and the observed intensities for the SH stretching vibration for Cys-425 and Cys-436 are consistent with the vibrational spectra of ethane thiols, which indicates significantly smaller intensities for thiols that exist in the cis configuration (torsion angle of 30°), relative to those that exist in trans configuration (torsion angle of 180°) (6Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The frequency of the SH stretching vibration of Cys-436 is not significantly altered on addition of kainate, AMPA, or glutamate, thus, suggesting that the environment of this residue is not significantly different among the apo, kainate, AMPA, or glutamate-bound states. On the other hand, the Cys-425 SH stretching frequency is unaltered on kainate binding (Fig. 5, trace B) but lowered to 2542 cm-1 on binding glutamate (Fig. 5, trace C) and AMPA (Fig. 5, trace D). The lack of any significant effect of the frequency on kainate binding suggests that the environment of this residue is not significantly altered. The downshift of ∼Δ18 cm-1 on binding of a full agonist to the protein implies that the SH hydrogen bond is stronger in this form of the protein, relative to the unligated and partial agonist-bound forms. Based on the studies of Li and Thomas (16Li H.M. Thomas Jr., G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 456-462Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar), in which a correlation was obtained between the SH stretching frequency and the SH distance, the ∼Δ18-cm-1 shift observed in the SH stretching vibration between the apo and full agonist can be correlated to a change in distance of the SH bond by 0.1 Å. This change is far beyond the resolution of the x-ray structures, and hence no changes were observed at the Cys-425 residue between the apo and various ligated forms of GluR2-S1S2. This result also highlights the ability of vibrational spectroscopy to probe specific interactions of interest in finer detail than most other structural methods. Can the SH stretching mode be used as an indicator for partial versus full agonism? The different effects of full and partial agonists on Cys-425 do not correlate with the degree of domain closure observed for the various agonists in the x-ray structures (full agonists > partial agonist > apo) or with the extent of secondary structural changes observed in this study. It is more likely, therefore, that the changes at the Cys-425 residue reflect local perturbations such as differences in the strength of the interactions of the ligand α-amine group with the protein. Pro-478, which is hydrogen-bonded to the amine groups of the ligands, is adjacent to the hydrogen-bonding partners of Cys-425 (Ile-476 and Ala-477). Therefore, based on the downshifts observed for glutamate and AMPA binding and the lack of an effect because of kainate binding, it can be concluded that the interactions between the α-amine group of glutamate and AMPA with the protein are stronger than the interaction of the α-amine group of kainate with the protein. This difference in the amine interaction could be one of the mechanisms by which full agonists induce larger conformational changes relative to partial agonists; however, additional interactions of the ligand, such as those at the γ substituents, are most likely involved in determining the final degree of domain closure.

https://openalex.org/W1976986966,"Lumenal ecto-nucleoside tri- and di-phosphohydrolases (ENTPDases) of the secretory pathway of eukaryotes hydrolyze nucleoside diphosphates resulting from glycosyltransferase-mediated reactions, yielding nucleoside monophosphates. The latter are weaker inhibitors of glycosyltransferases than the former and are also antiporters for the transport of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus (GA) lumen. Here we describe the presence of two cation-dependent nucleotide phosphohydrolase activities in membranes of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>: one, UDA-1, is a UDP/GDPase encoded by the gene <i>uda-1</i>, whereas the other is an apyrase encoded by the gene <i>ntp-1.</i> UDA-1 shares significant amino acid sequence similarity to yeast GA Gda1p and mammalian UDP/GDPases and has a lumenal active site in vesicles displaying an intermediate density between those of the ER and GA when expressed in <i>S. cerevisiae</i>. NTP-1 expressed in COS-7 cells appeared to localize to the GA. The transcript of <i>uda-1</i> but not those of two other <i>C. elegans</i> ENTPDase mRNAs (<i>ntp-1</i> and <i>mig-23</i>) was induced up to 3.5-fold by high temperature, tunicamycin, and ethanol. The same effectors triggered the unfolded protein response as shown by the induction of expression of green fluorescent protein under the control of the BiP chaperone promoter and the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. Up-regulation of <i>uda-1</i> did not occur in <i>ire-1</i>-deficient mutants, demonstrating the role of this ER stress sensor in this event. We hypothesize that up-regulation of <i>uda-1</i> favors hydrolysis of the glucosyltransferase inhibitory product UDP to UMP, and that the latter product then exits the lumen of the ER or pre-GA compartment in a coupled exchange with the entry of UDP-glucose, thereby further relieving ER stress by favoring protein re-glycosylation."
