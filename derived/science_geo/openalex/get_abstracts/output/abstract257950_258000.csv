https://openalex.org/W2119792333,"Despite evidence pointing to a ubiquitous tendency of human minds to wander, little is known about the neural operations that support this core component of human cognition. Using both thought sampling and brain imaging, the current investigation demonstrated that mind-wandering is associated with activity in a default network of cortical regions that are active when the brain is “at rest.” In addition, individuals' reports of the tendency of their minds to wander were correlated with activity in this network."
https://openalex.org/W2009775082,"A large electric field at the surface of a ferromagnetic metal is expected to appreciably change its electron density. In particular, the metal's intrinsic magnetic properties, which are commonly regarded as fixed material constants, will be affected. This requires, however, that the surface has a strong influence on the material's properties, as is the case with ultrathin films. We demonstrated that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of ordered iron-platinum (FePt) and iron-palladium (FePd) intermetallic compounds can be reversibly modified by an applied electric field when immersed in an electrolyte. A voltage change of –0.6 volts on 2-nanometer-thick films altered the coercivity by –4.5 and +1% in FePt and FePd, respectively. The modification of the magnetic parameters was attributed to a change in the number of unpaired d electrons in response to the applied electric field. Our device structure is general and should be applicable for characterization of other thin-film magnetic systems."

A 10-year decomposition experiment in 21 sites from seven biomes found that net N release from leaf litter is dominantly driven by the initial tissue N concentration and mass remaining regardless of climate, edaphic conditions, or biota. Arid grasslands exposed to high ultraviolet radiation were an exception, where net N release was insensitive to initial N. Roots released N linearly with decomposition and exhibited little net N immobilization. We suggest that fundamental constraints on decomposer physiologies lead to predictable global-scale patterns in net N release during decomposition."

The 1918 virus is also highly pathogenic in mice, and studies have identified a multigenic origin of this virulent phenotype in mice. However, these initial characterizations of the 1918 virus did not address the question of its pathogenic potential in primates. Here we demonstrate that the 1918 virus caused a highly pathogenic respiratory infection in a cynomolgus macaque model that culminated in acute respiratory distress and a fatal outcome. Furthermore, infected animals mounted an immune response, characterized by dysregulation of the antiviral response, that was insufficient for protection, indicating that atypical host innate immune responses may contribute to lethality. The ability of influenza viruses to modulate host immune responses, such as that demonstrated for the avian H5N1 influenza viruses, may be a feature shared by the virulent influenza viruses."

We measured the dynamics and mechanical properties of a simple three-component model system consisting of myosin II, actin filaments, and cross-linkers. In this system, stresses arising from motor activity controlled the cytoskeletal network mechanics, increasing stiffness by a factor of nearly 100 and qualitatively changing the viscoelastic response of the network in an adenosine triphosphate–dependent manner. We present a quantitative theoretical model connecting the large-scale properties of this active gel to molecular force generation."

To investigate the role of PVL in pulmonary disease, we tested the pathogenicity of clinical isolates, isogenic PVL-negative and PVL-positive S. aureus strains, as well as purified PVL, in a mouse acute pneumonia model. Here we show that PVL is sufficient to cause pneumonia and that the expression of this leukotoxin induces global changes in transcriptional levels of genes encoding secreted and cell wall–anchored staphylococcal proteins, including the lung inflammatory factor staphylococcal protein A (Spa)."
https://openalex.org/W2066019921,"Nanoparticles can be used as the building blocks for materials such as supracrystals or ionic liquids. However, they lack the ability to bond along specific directions as atoms and molecules do. We report a simple method to place target molecules specifically at two diametrically opposed positions in the molecular coating of metal nanoparticles. The approach is based on the functionalization of the polar singularities that must form when a curved surface is coated with ordered monolayers, such as a phase-separated mixture of ligands. The molecules placed at these polar defects have been used as chemical handles to form nanoparticle chains that in turn can generate self-standing films."

Assessing the impact of novel farming practices on biodiversity and ecosystem services is fundamental to this process. Using farmland birds as a model system, we present a generic risk assessment framework that accurately predicts each species' current conservation status and population growth rate associated with past changes in agriculture. We demonstrate its value by assessing the potential impact on biodiversity of two controversial land uses, genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops and agri-environment schemes. This framework can be used to guide policy and land management decisions and to assess progress toward sustainability targets."
https://openalex.org/W2069464272,"Cryptochromes are blue light-sensing photoreceptors found in plants, animals, and humans. They are known to play key roles in the regulation of the circadian clock and in development. However, despite striking structural similarities to photolyase DNA repair enzymes, cryptochromes do not repair double-stranded DNA, and their mechanism of action is unknown. Recently, a blue light-dependent intramolecular electron transfer to the excited state flavin was characterized and proposed as the primary mechanism of light activation. The resulting formation of a stable neutral flavin semiquinone intermediate enables the photoreceptor to absorb green/yellow light (500–630 nm) in addition to blue light in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that Arabidopsis cryptochrome activation by blue light can be inhibited by green light in vivo consistent with a change of the cofactor redox state. We further characterize light-dependent changes in the cryptochrome1 (cry1) protein in living cells, which match photoreduction of the purified cry1 in vitro. These experiments were performed using fluorescence absorption/emission and EPR on whole cells and thereby represent one of the few examples of the active state of a known photoreceptor being monitored in vivo. These results indicate that cry1 activation via blue light initiates formation of a flavosemiquinone signaling state that can be converted by green light to an inactive form. In summary, cryptochrome activation via flavin photoreduction is a reversible mechanism novel to blue light photoreceptors. This photocycle may have adaptive significance for sensing the quality of the light environment in multiple organisms.

In summary, cryptochrome activation via flavin photoreduction is a reversible mechanism novel to blue light photoreceptors. This photocycle may have adaptive significance for sensing the quality of the light environment in multiple organisms. Cryptochromes are flavin-type blue light photoreceptors found in many organisms including bacteria, plants, animals, and humans (1Banerjee R. Batschauer A.

They mediate a variety of blue light-dependent responses including photomorphogenesis and growth responses in plants and entrainment of the circadian clock in animals such as Drosophila and mouse (4Li Q.-H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 34079-34082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The common feature of cryptochrome photoreceptors is their marked homology to photolyase DNA repair enzymes, such that the primary amino acid sequence homology of cryptochromes to photolyases is in many instances as high as the homology between photolyases from different species to each other (7Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar, 8Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Like photolyases, cryptochromes bind flavin chromophores, and x-ray crystallographic analysis indicates marked structural similarity to photolyases, particularly in the flavin-binding pocket (9Brudler R. Hitomi K. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Kucho K. Ishiura M. Kanehisa M. Roberts V.A. Todo T. Trainer A. Getzoff E.D. Mol.

Cryptochromes are divided into three subclasses: animal, plant, and DASH 3The abbreviations used are: DASH, Drosophila, Arabidopsis, Synechocystis, human; CPD, cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimer; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide. cryptochromes (2Lin C. Todo T. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). However, cryptochromes differ from photolyases in that they generally show no DNA repair activity. Only single-stranded DNA repair activity in vitro was shown recently for DASH cryptochromes (11Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17696-17700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they generally contain C-terminal extensions of variable sizes, which may be important for protein-protein interactions with signaling partners. In Arabidopsis, signaling partners include the regulatory protein COP1, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that plays a key role in photomorphogenesis and development. This protein is known to interact to the C-terminal extensions of both cry1 and cry2 (12Wang H. Ma L.-G. Li J.-M. Zhao H.-Y. Deng X.W. Science. 2001; 294: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 13Yang H-Q. Tang R.-H. Cashmore A.R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 2573-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In animals such as Drosophila and mouse, cryptochromes interact with components of the circadian clock (14Green C.B. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R847-R849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Experiments probing the function of particular domains of cryptochrome receptors suggest that light initiates a conformational change in the protein permitting interaction with downstream signaling partners (15Yang H.-Q. Wu Y.-J. Tang R.-H. Liu D. Liu Y. Cashmore A.R. Cell. 2000; 103: 815-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for light-induced conformational change has been recently obtained with purified Arabidopsis cry1 both by partial proteolysis (16Partch C.L. Clarkson M.W. Ozgur S. Lee A.L. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3795-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and Fourier transform infrared techniques (17Kottke T. Batschauer A. Ahmad M. Heberle J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2472-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the primary photoreaction of cryptochromes, as well as the means whereby the light signal is transduced into a signaling cascade by the photoreceptor, has remained a matter of debate (18Partch C. Sancar A. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Given the marked similarity of cryptochromes to photolyases, it is reasonable to assume that their primary photoreactions may be related. The generally accepted mechanism of DNA repair in photolyases (19Carell T. Burgdorf L.T. Kundu L.M. Cichon M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Weber S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) involves light-dependent electron transfer from fully reduced flavin to either cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPD, in the case of CPD photolyases) or to 6-4 photoproducts (in the case of 6-4 photolyases) in UV-damaged double-stranded DNA. The resulting reaction is catalytic, in that the DNA lesion is repaired and the electron subsequently returns to the flavin cofactor, restoring fully reduced flavin. Because this photoreaction does not occur to any significant extent in most cryptochromes (1Banerjee R. Batschauer A. Planta. 2005; 220: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Lin C. Todo T. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 3Briggs W.R. Schäfer E. Nagy F. 3rd Ed. Photomorphogenesis in Plants and Bacteria. Springer, Dordrecht, Netherlands2006: 171-197Google Scholar), it cannot be involved in blue light signaling. However, in addition to DNA repair, photolyases are capable of undergoing another photoreaction known as “photoactivation,” which has been demonstrated in purified preparations of photolyases in which the flavin cofactor is not in its catalytically active, fully reduced, redox state (20Weber S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1707: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 21Byrdin M. Sartora V. Eker A.P. Vos M.H. Aubert C. Brettel K. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this reaction, light induces electron transfer to the excited flavin through a chain of amino acids (tryptophan or tyrosine residues) from the surface of the protein, thereby reducing the flavin. This reaction occurs both in classical type I CPD photolyases (to which plant cryptochromes are most closely related) and in 6-4 photolyases (to which animal type cryptochromes are more closely related) (21Byrdin M. Sartora V. Eker A.P. Vos M.H. Aubert C. Brettel K. Mathis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because photolyases contain mostly fully reduced flavin in living cells (22Kavakli I.H. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15103-15110Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), this photoreaction is not important for DNA repair. However, because the Trp residues forming the intramolecular electron transfer are conserved in most cryptochrome sequences that are known currently, the question has arisen as to whether this photoreaction may be important for cryptochrome signaling. Evidence favoring this possibility has come from a number of experimental approaches; action spectroscopy for cry1-dependent plant hypocotyl growth inhibition has revealed a wavelength sensitivity (23Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) consistent with oxidized flavin (peak absorption at 450 nm) as the active photopigment in vivo, rather than reduced flavin, as is the case for photolyases. Experiments with purified cry1 protein showed that photoreduction of oxidized flavin occurs in vitro (24Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Schuman Jornes M. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and the relative stability of the flavosemiquinone intermediate was noted. Recently, a chain of intramolecular electron transfer events to the excited state flavin subsequent to light activation of purified cry1 protein (25Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) has been documented. Because such reactions involving light-driven electron transfer chains are rare in biological systems, these data provided support for a functional role of this pathway. Further evidence of a biological role for photoreduction in the activation of cryptochromes was provided by the observation that single amino acid substitution of tryptophan residues necessary for this reaction in vitro results in virtual loss of biological function in vivo (26Zeugner A. Byrdin M. Bouly J.P. Bakrim N. Giovani B. Brettel K. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19437-19440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Finally, magnetic effects on cryptochrome-dependent growth responses have been identified in Arabidopsis, which could only result from a mechanism of photoreceptor activation involving radical pair formation (27Ahmad M. Galland P. Ritz T. Wiltschko R. Wiltschko W. Planta. 2006; 224: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as occurs in the course of light-driven electron transfer. Therefore, light-mediated electron transfer leading to flavin photoreduction has been proposed as the primary signaling reaction for cryptochrome photoreceptors in vivo. In the present work, we have provided conclusive evidence for this mechanism by demonstrating that flavin photoreduction follows light activation of Arabidopsis cry1 in vivo using a combination of physiological, spectroscopic, and biophysical techniques. We show that cryptochrome activation by blue light in Arabidopsis is inhibited by co-irradiation with green light in a manner consistent with the formation of a long-lived neutral flavin radical (green-light absorbing) intermediate. Light-dependent changes in the cry1 protein are then characterized directly in living insect cells expressing high levels of recombinant cry1. Whole cell fluorescence techniques are used to measure the decrease of oxidized flavin associated with cry1 following light activation in these cells. The resulting accumulation of a metastable semiquinone intermediate is demonstrated by EPR using this same whole cell expression assay. Finally, we demonstrate interconversion between redox forms of purified cry1 and show that the effect of green light in vitro corresponds to the redox changes observed in vivo. The present work also represents one of the few studies, other than of the classic plant phytochromes (28Smith H. Nature. 2000; 407: 589Google Scholar) or in rhodopsins (29Spudich J.L. Bogomolni R.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), where photoreversible changes in a known photoreceptor have been determined within living cells. Plant Material, Light Treatments, and Growth Conditions—Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana of the indicated genotypes (see legends for Figs. 1 and 2) were sterilized and sown on 0.5× MS salts as described (23Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 48 h at 277 K for inbibition, plates were transferred to white light for a further 48 h until radicle emergence to ensure synchronous germination (23Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Plates were subsequently transferred to the test conditions, and hypocotyl length was determined from an average of at least 20 seedlings/test condition. Anthocyanin levels were determined as described (30Ahmad M. Lin C. Cashmore A.R. Plant J. 1995; 8: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) for 30 seedlings at a time according to the formula A530–0.25 × A657 of the extracted pigments.

Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Seedlings were harvested and immediately ground and boiled in SDS sample loading buffer. Prior to running protein gels, protein concentration was quantified by Bio-Rad protein assay to ensure equal loading of wells. The load was subsequently verified after running of the gel and transfer to membrane, either by staining the blots (Fig. 2, a–c) or by reprobing the blots with anti-DnaK antibody (Fig. 2d) (32Neumann D. Emmermann M. Thierfelder J.M. zur Nieden U. Clericus M. Braun H.P. Nover L. Schmitz U.K. Planta. 1993; 190: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Bands were quantified from scanned photographic images using Quantity One imaging software from Bio-Rad. All experiments were repeated in a minimum of three independent trials with qualitatively similar results. Whole Cell Fluorescence Emission Experiments—Living Sf21 insect cells expressing cry1 protein or uninfected controls were centrifuged from culture medium, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and placed directly into cuvettes at 283 K for measurement of fluorescence spectra. Fluorescence emission at 525 nm was monitored in a Varian fluorescence spectrophotometer over a range of excitation wavelengths or at a single designated wavelength as indicated (see Fig. 3 legend). Excitation and/or emission spectra were always determined in parallel both for infected (cry1-expressing) and uninfected cell cultures at identical cell density. For light treatments, samples were removed from the spectrophotometer and placed on ice. Illumination was carried on for the indicated times using the designated interference filters placed before a slide projector to provide sufficient light intensity. Samples were then returned to the fluorescence spectrophotometer to monitor differences in excitation and emission spectra. All experiments were repeated for a minimum of five independent trials with qualitatively similar results. UV-visible Spectroscopy—In vivo absorption difference spectra of cry1 were determined directly from living insect cells in an Uvikon 930 spectrophotometer. For these experiments absorption spectra of whole cells expressing cry1 protein were taken at 283 K and set as blank. Cells from the identical culture were subsequently transferred to ice and irradiated for 10 min with blue light at the indicated wavelength and light intensity. Samples were returned to the spectrophotometer for measurement and absorption spectra were taken with reference to the initial time point (t0). Difference spectra plotted were the average of 11 such measurements, obtained independently on the identical cell cultures. For spectra obtained from purified protein, A. thaliana cry1 or A. thaliana CPD photolyase were purified by established techniques. A. thaliana cry1 and CPD photolyase were then transferred into buffer (0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at identical concentrations estimated from FAD absorbance at 450 nm (ϵ450 = 1.12 × 104 m–1cm–1). Optical spectroscopy was carried out at 290 K at the indicated times and light treatments. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band cw-EPR spectra were recorded using a pulsed EPR spectrometer (Bruker Elexsys E580) with a cavity resonator (Bruker SHQE-4122-W1) and helium cryostat (Oxford CF-910). X-band pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded on the same spectrometer using an ENDOR accessory (Bruker E560-DP), an rf amplifier (Amplifier Research 250A250A), and a dielectric-ring ENDOR resonator (Bruker EN4118X-MD-4W1) immersed in a helium gas flow cryostat (Oxford CF-935). The temperature was regulated to ±0.1 K by a temperature controller (Oxford ITC-503S). The cw-EPR spectra were recorded at 120 K with a microwave power of 3.0 microwatts, at 9.38 GHz microwave frequency with field modulation amplitude of 0.3 millitesla (at 100 kHz modulation frequency). For Davies-type ENDOR spectroscopy, a microwave pulse sequence π -T-π /2-τ-π with 64 and 128 ns π /2 and π pulses, respectively, and a RF pulse of 10-μs duration starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse were used. The pulse separations T and τ between the microwave pulses were selected to be 13 μs and 500 ns, respectively. To avoid saturation effects due to long relaxation times, the entire pulse pattern was repeated with a low repetition frequency of 200 Hz. Spectra were taken at a magnetic field of 345.7 millitorrs and a microwave frequency of 9.71 GHz. Sf21 insect cells expressing N-terminal His-tagged cry1 and control Sf21 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 50% (v/v) glycerol in the dark. Aliquots were transferred into EPR quartz tubes (3 mm inner diameter) and illuminated for different times at 290 K with blue light (Halolux 30HL, Streppel, Wermelskirchen-Tente, Germany) using a 420–470-nm band filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Samples were then frozen rapidly under illumination in liquid nitrogen and stored therein. Cryptochrome responds primarily to UVA/blue light (peak near 450 nm) and only weakly above 500 nm, consistent with oxidized flavin as a primary photosensor (23Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 33Lin C. Ahmad M. Gordon D. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8423-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). If the primary photoreaction of cryptochrome involves photoreduction of the flavin to the radical state (24Lin C. Robertson D.E.

It further follows that bichromatic irradiations (green light given simultaneously with blue light) should decrease the responsiveness of cry1 because the added green light would decrease (by formation of fully reduced flavin, which absorbs only weak in the visible range between 400–500 nm) the levels of active semiquinone intermediate. To test this mechanism, blue light-dependent hypocotyl growth inhibition, which is largely cry1-dependent in Arabidopsis (23Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), was investigated under conditions of both monochromatic (blue light) and bichromatic (blue plus green light) irradiation. Consistent with the proposed mechanism, hypocotyl growth inhibition was significantly more pronounced in blue light (472 nm) than in seedlings co-irradiated with green light (564 nm) under the identical blue light intensity (Fig. 1a). Green light irradiation by itself under these conditions resulted in little difference in hypocotyl growth as compared with dark grown seedlings, in contrast to short-term illumination conditions (34Folta K.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or broad bandwidth green light (28Smith H. Nature. 2000; 407: 589Google Scholar). In phytochrome-deficient phyAphyB mutants, green light also acts antagonistically to blue light but not in cryptochrome-deficient cry1cry2 double mutant seedlings (Fig. 1a). Therefore the antagonistic effect of green light on hypocotyl growth inhibition requires cry1 and/or cry2. Qualitatively similar results (antagonistic effect of green light) were obtained for anthocyanin accumulation, which is also largely under the control of cry1 in blue light (Fig. 1b). In nature, plants under a canopy are exposed to light enriched in green wavelengths (35Franklin K.A. Whitelam G.C. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2005; 96: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 36Vandenbussche F. Pierik R. Millenaar F.F. Voesenek L.A. van der Straeten D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Therefore, antagonistic effects of green and blue light might have adaptive significance, leading to increased elongation growth (decreased hypocotyl growth inhibition) as a response to shading. We show that for hypocotyl growth inhibition (Fig. 1c), green light also acts antagonistically to white light and that this response is cryptochrome-mediated, thereby suggesting adaptive significance in analogy to the classic phytochrome-dependent shade avoidance response mediated by phyB-D-E (35Franklin K.A. Whitelam G.C. Ann. Bot. (Lond.). 2005; 96: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 36Vandenbussche F. Pierik R. Millenaar F.F. Voesenek L.A. van der Straeten D. Curr. Opin.

A. 1998; 95: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) is a rapid (within minutes) and direct assay for photoreceptor activation. Etiolated seedlings accumulate high levels of cry2 protein in the dark, which decline rapidly subsequent to blue light (B) irradiation (Fig. 2a). Bichromatic irradiation with blue light and 582 nm green light (Fig. 2a, B+G) caused significant reduction in the rate of cry2 degradation as compared with blue light control seedlings. Red light, which is not absorbed by the flavosemiquinone, was ineffective in retarding cry2 degradation (Fig. 2a, compare B+R with B+G). Bichromatic irradiation was then performed at wavelengths at which the flavosemiquinone can efficiently absorb light (531, 540, 567, and 591 nm). At these wavelengths of green light, responsiveness of cry1 to blue light was significantly reduced (Fig. 2b). Inhibition by 582 nm green light occurred most efficiently at 10 and 60 μmol m–2s–1, well above the blue light intensity used in these experiments (Fig. 2c). These data are consistent with a mechanism involving alteration of levels of an existing semiquinone pool. Finally, pulse experiments showed that the effects of blue and green light are separable in time, consistent with a long-lived semiqinone intermediate compatible with a role in signaling (Fig. 2d). Direct determination of the redox state of cry1 in living plants is difficult for technical reasons such as low levels of cry1 protein and high pigment background. We consequently adopted a whole cell approach (38Galland P. Toelle N. Planta. 2003; 217: 971-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using baculovirus-infected insect cells expressing cry1 protein to high levels. Oxidized flavin can be detected in these living cells by directly monitoring fluorescence emission at 525 nm subsequent to excitation at different wavelengths in a fluorimeter. The excitation spectrum is essentially similar to oxidized flavin (Fig. 3a), although light scattering and masking by other pigments in these living cells presumably causes the loss of fine structure as compared with purified cryptochrome in solution. When this assay was performed on insect cells expressing cry1 protein, emission at 525 nm was severalfold higher than in uninfected cells; this increased signal was generated by the large quantities of oxidized flavin bound to cry1protein in vivo (24Lin C.

In the past, actin networks in vitro have been studied mainly as collections of randomly organized filaments, and experiments have revealed stiffening of the network on the application of stress. A new study of dendritic actin networks (similar to those in some motile cells) shows that these architectures do undergo stress stiffening, but that it is followed by reversible stress softening at higher loads. These dendritic architectures appear to be geared towards bearing high compressive loads, but the mechanical properties of such networks more generally are the result of a complex interplay of different elastic regimes. The mechanical properties of cells play an essential role in numerous physiological processes. Organized networks of semiflexible actin filaments determine cell stiffness and transmit force during mechanotransduction, cytokinesis, cell motility and other cellular shape changes1,2,3. Although numerous actin-binding proteins have been identified that organize networks, the mechanical properties of actin networks with physiological architectures and concentrations have been difficult to measure quantitatively. Studies of mechanical properties in vitro have found that crosslinked networks of actin filaments formed in solution exhibit stress stiffening arising from the entropic elasticity of individual filaments or crosslinkers resisting extension4,5,6,7,8. Here we report reversible stress-softening behaviour in actin networks reconstituted in vitro that suggests a critical role for filaments resisting compression. Using a modified atomic force microscope to probe dendritic actin networks (like those formed in the lamellipodia of motile cells), we observe stress stiffening followed by a regime of reversible stress softening at higher loads. This softening behaviour can be explained by elastic buckling of individual filaments under compression that avoids catastrophic fracture of the network. The observation of both stress stiffening and softening suggests a complex interplay between entropic and enthalpic elasticity in determining the mechanical properties of actin networks."

During Drosophila gastrulation, apical constrictions under the control of the transcription factor Twist lead to the invagination of the mesoderm. Twist-controlled G protein signaling is involved in mediating the invagination but is not sufficient to account for the full activity of Twist. We identified a Twist target, the transmembrane protein T48, which acts in conjunction with G protein signaling to orchestrate shape changes. Together with G protein signaling, T48 recruits adherens junctions and the cytoskeletal regulator RhoGEF2 to the sites of apical constriction, ensuring rapid and intense changes in cell shape."

Many models assume that the weakness of the asthenosphere is related to the presence of small amounts of hydrous melts. However, the mechanism that may cause melting in the asthenosphere is not well understood. We show that the asthenosphere coincides with a zone where the water solubility in mantle minerals has a pronounced minimum. The minimum is due to a sharp decrease of water solubility in aluminous orthopyroxene with depth, whereas the water solubility in olivine continuously increases with pressure. Melting in the asthenosphere may therefore be related not to volatile enrichment but to a minimum in water solubility, which causes excess water to form a hydrous silicate melt."

Furthermore, spike activity is driven by depolarizing synaptic transients rather than pacemaker properties.

Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is usually a progressive process, and the main morphological manifestation of such progression is a poorly understood process known as cardiac remodeling. The latter is a rather complex phenomenon secondary to, as well as responsible for, anatomical, cellular, molecular, and humoral changes (2Anversa P. Nadal-Ginard B.

Recent data have added new pieces to the puzzle of cardiac remodeling. We and others (see Ref. 4Torella D. Ellison G.M. Karakikes I. Nadal-Ginard B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have identified a population of cells with stem and progenitor cell characteristics in the hearts of adult mammals, including humans. These cardiac stem/progenitor cells, hereafter identified together as CSCs, are essential for maintaining normal cardiac cellular homeostasis throughout life by regenerating myocardial cells lost by wear and tear (5Nadal-Ginard B.

CSCs, when injected into an infarcted myocardium, give rise to new functionally competent myocytes and vascular structures (6Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S.

However, the role, if any, of CSCs during cardiac adaptation to stress remains unclear. Also unknown is whether cardiac insults that severely damage myocytes also affect the CSCs. In HF, cardiac contractility is impaired by abnormalities in the structure and/or function of molecules responsible for calcium (Ca2+) handling within the myocytes (3Wehrens X.H.T. Marks A.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 10Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 69-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Chronically elevated concentrations of catecholamines are a hallmark of chronic HF and contribute to the alterations in intracellular Ca2+ handling (11Cohn J.N. Levine T.B. Olivari M.T. Garberg V.

Indeed, chronic hyperactivity of the β-adrenoreceptor (AR) signaling pathway in HF leads to PKA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) of the sarcoplamic reticulum, which in turn results in continuous intracellular Ca2+ leakage (12Marx S.O.

Interestingly, spikes of excessive circulating catecholamines correlate with acute episodes of heart failure (i.e.“Takotsubo stress” cardiomyopathy) (17Wittstein I.S. Thiemann D.R. Lima J.A.

Despite its biological and clinical significance, the mechanism(s) by which acute cathecolaminergic overload causes LV impairment remains unknown. Furthermore, regardless of the mechanism mediating myocyte damage and dysfunction, the effects of adrenergic overload on CSCs remain to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, a single injection of isoproterenol (ISO) was employed to induce acute diffuse myocyte damage and RyR2 expression and function in adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) were assessed in vivo and in vitro.We show here that acute β-cathecolaminergic overload causes significant myocyte apoptosis and necrosis, leading to acute but reversible cardiac failure, resembling “stress cardiomyopathy.” In addition, our data suggest that the acute ISO-induced myocyte damage is mediated by Ca2+ leakage through transiently dysfunctional RyR2 protein complex. The differentiation stage-specific pattern of expression of β1- and β2-ARs and the absence of RyR2 in the CSCs partially accounts for the resistance of these cells to ISO damage. Thus, CSCs are available to potentially contribute to cardiac recovery following acute neurohumoral stress damage.

Dead myocytes were detected and quantified using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Myocyte diameter was measured across the nucleus in transverse hematoxylin and eosin sections of the subendocardium layer. Myocyte volume was calculated assuming a spherical cross-section.

CSCs were identified as lineage-negative (Linneg), by staining negative for markers of hematopoietic, neural, and skeletal muscle lineages (6Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F.

In Vitro Response of CSCs And ARVMs to ISO—ARVMs were maintained in α-MEM medium for 16 h (19Communal C. Singh K. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S.

The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519 (100 nm or 1.0 μm;a kind gift of Dr. Andrew Marks, Center for Molecular Cardiology, Columbia University, New York) was added 45 min before ISO. In separate dishes, the L-type Ca2+ channel blockers, verapamil (20 μm) or diltiazem (20 μm), were added 30 min before ISO. ARVMs were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, and TdT staining was performed. The percentage of apoptotic TdT-positive (TdTpos) myocytes was determined and quantified using confocal microscopy. The same experiments were repeated using freshly isolated ARVMs. CSCs were plated on 35-mm dishes in modified F12K medium supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and were treated with ISO at the same concentrations as ARVMs (see above). All dishes were supplemented with ascorbic acid (0.1 mmol/liter). The β1- and β2-AR blockers, CGP20172A (0.3 μm) and ICI 118551 (0.1 μm), were added 30 min before ISO, respectively. Eight hours after ISO treatment, cells were fixed and stained, and the percentage of apoptotic TdTpos CSCs was determined (18Torella D. Rota M. Nurzynska D. Musso E. Monsen A. Shiraishi I. Zias E.

Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from ARVMs and CSCs using the FastTrack® MAG kit (Invitrogen). Real time RT-PCR was performed using the Taqman detection protocol in an ABI Prism 7700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The results for β1-AR, β2-AR, and RyR2 real time RT-PCR assays were averaged and normalized to product produced by the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, providing a relative quantitation value. Primers were designed using the Primer Express™ program (Applied Biosystems), and the specific sequences were as follows: AAGTCCTCCCTCAAGCTCCTAAGT (forward) and TTGCTTTGCCTTTGCCC (reverse) for β-MHC; 5′-CCCGCCTCGCTGCTGCCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCCAGCAGAGCGTGAAC-3′ (reverse) for β1-AR; 5′-ACGAGCTCAGTGTGCAGGACGCGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAAATCCCTGCCTACAACACTCCA-3′ (reverse) for β2-AR; 5′-GCAAACTTGGAGTTCTTGTCAGGCAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCGTTGACGTCAACAGAACTT-3′ (reverse) for RyR2; 5′-ATTGCTCTCAATGACAACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAACTTTATTGATGGTATTCG-3′ (reverse) for GAPDH. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations were carried out using protein lysates obtained from freshly isolated CSCs or ARVMs (18Torella D. Rota M. Nurzynska D. Musso E. Monsen A.

Generally, the equivalent of ∼50 μg of proteins were separated on gradient (6-15%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, blocked with either 5% dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with rabbit polyclonal Abs against β1-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β2-AR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), calstabin, RyR2-5029, phospho-Ser2808-RyR2 (PKA site of RyR2-phosphorylation), phospho-Ser2814-RyR2 (CaMKII site of RyR2-phosphorylation) (a kind gift of Dr. A. R. Marks), CaMKII, phospho-CaMKII, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Cell Signaling), PKA, phospho-PKAα (Abcam) at dilutions suggested by the manufacturers. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and the Chemidoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analysis—Data are reported as mean ± S.D. Significance between two groups was determined by Student's t test and in multiple comparisons by the analysis of variance. The Bonferroni post hoc method was used to locate the differences. Significance was set at p < 0.05. ISO Produces Acute but Transient Cardiac Failure—Subcutaneous administration of 5 mg kg-1 ISO resulted in ∼20% mortality of the treated animals. In these ISO-treated rats, the EKG showed ST ischemic changes followed by rapid sustained ventricular tachycardia, which developed into ventricular fibrillation and death of the animal (Fig. 1, A-F). In the majority of the rats treated with ISO (n = 21), ST changes were evident, and periods of short bursts of ventricular tachycardia were registered during the EKG monitoring immediately after ISO administration (Fig. 1, G and H). Blood pressure of ISO-treated animals was lower than in CTRL at 1 day but returned to normal values at 3-6 days after ISO injection (Table 1). Heart rates in ISO-treated rats were significantly higher at 6-24 h but returned to normal at 3 days after ISO injection (Table 1). Since the plasma half-time for ISO is typically in the range of 4-5 min, the presence of tachycardia at 1 day after ISO is mainly the result of the pathophysiological adaptation of LV mechanics to the acute and temporary decompensated functional state secondary to the ISO injection (see below).TABLE 1Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and anatomical measurementsCTRLISO 1 dayISO 3 daysISO 6 daysSBPaSystolic blood pressure.

Open table in a new tab Indeed, ventricular function parameters document that the single ISO injection caused marked changes in LV performance (Table 1). At 1 day after injection, when compared with CTRL, ISO-treated animals exhibited a significantly decreased (p < 0.05) LV developed pressure, dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin and increased LV end-diastolic pressure, uncovering acute and severe LV failure in all treated animals. These parameters started to improve 3 days after treatment and had returned to control values by day 6 except for end-systolic pressure, which still was lower than at 1 day after ISO (Table 1). Echo data confirmed that ISO caused acute LV failure at 1 day and that LV function spontaneously recovered at 6 days (Fig. 1I and Table 1). ISO Causes Myocyte Death through both Necrosis and Apoptosis—In the rat heart with patent coronary circulation, ISO exposure caused diffuse necrotic and apoptotic myocyte death throughout the myocardium (Figs. 2 and 3). Hematoxylin and eosin cross-sections from ISO-treated hearts displayed myocytes with disrupted sarcolemmal membranes and pale cytoplasmic staining, implicating focal necrosis. This was most evident in the subendocardium (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, 3 days after ISO-induced damage, an increased inflammatory reaction was evident (Fig. 2A). Myocyte-specific necrosis was detected by injecting in vivo a mouse anti-myosin monoclonal antibody, which exclusively tags necrotic myocytes (13Goldspink D.F. Burniston J.G. Ellison G.M. Clark W.A. Tan L.B. Exp. Physiol. 2004; 89: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). The fraction of necrotic myocytes was 8 ± 2% at 1 day in the subendocardial layer (p < 0.001 versus CTRL; 0 ± 0%; Fig. 2C). The other two layers were less affected by ISO (data not shown).FIGURE 3Isoproterenol caused acute myocyte apoptosis along with RyR2 dysfunction and reactive myocyte hypertrophy in the LV.

K, the levels of calstabin were not affected by ISO injection, whereas calstabin was displaced from the RyR2 complex at 1 day as shown by the immunoprecipitation with RyR2 and the Western blot for calstabin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Necrotic myocytes progressively decreased from day 3 to 6 but were still higher than CTRL (p < 0.05; Fig. 2C). All evidence indicates that most, if not all, of the cardiac damage occurred during the first 24 h, but the scavenger system was overloaded to efficiently remove the cell debris. To confirm myocyte necrosis after ISO injection, we measured cTnI in blood samples taken from the animals sacrificed 1 day after ISO. Increased plasma levels of cTnI or cardiac troponin T are highly specific for and correlate with the size of the damaged myocardium (20Jaffe A.S. Ravkilde J. Roberts R. Naslund U. Apple F.S. Galvani M. Katus H. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). ISO treatment resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.001) in blood cTnI (Fig. 2D), reaching 93 ± 10 ng/ml, which in humans corresponds to large infarct sizes (20Jaffe A.S. Ravkilde J. Roberts R. Naslund U. Apple F.S. Galvani M. Katus H. Circulation. 2000; 102: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These values are in agreement with the loss of 17 ± 4% of myocyte mass 1 day after ISO administration (see below). ISO-induced myocyte apoptosis was identified by labeling for caspase-3 and was confirmed using the TdT (terminal dUTP nick-end labeling) assay with dUTP (Fig. 3, A-D). The number of apoptotic myocytes in CTRL animals was minimal (caspase-3-labeled myocytes, 0.02 ± 0.01%; TdT-labeled myocyte nuclei, 0.01 ± 0.01%). In contrast, the percentage of apoptotic myocytes in the LV of ISO-treated animals was significantly (p < 0.05) increased at 1 day (caspase-3, 0.4 ± 0.16%; TdT, 0.7 ± 0.29%) in the severely damaged subendocardial layer (Fig. 3, C and D), being less in the midwall and subepicardial layers (data not shown), compared with CTRL. Like necrotic myocytes, the myocyte apoptosis rate had decreased by 3-6 days after ISO but was still significantly greater than CTRL (Fig."

https://openalex.org/W2033841689,"The small G-protein RhoA regulates the actin cytoskeleton, and its involvement in cell proliferation has also been established. In contrast, little is known about whether RhoA participates in cell survival or apoptosis. In cardiomyocytes in vitro, RhoA induces hypertrophic cell growth and gene expression. In vivo, however, RhoA expression leads to development of heart failure (Sah, V. P., Minamisawa, S., Tam, S. P., Wu, T. H., Dorn, G. W., Ross, J. Jr., Chien, K. R., and Brown, J. H. (1999) J. Clin. Investig. 103, 1627–1634), a condition widely associated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis. We demonstrate here that adenoviral overexpression of activated RhoA in cardiomyocytes induces hypertrophy, which transitions over time to apoptosis, as evidenced by caspase activation and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The Rho kinase inhibitors Y-27632 and HA-1077 and expression of a dominant negative Rho kinase block these responses. Caspase-9, but not caspase-8, is activated, and its inhibition prevents DNA fragmentation, consistent with involvement of a mitochondrial death pathway. Interestingly, RhoA expression induces a 3–4-fold up-regulation of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bax. RhoA also increases levels of activated Bax and the amount of Bax protein localized at mitochondria. Bax mRNA is increased by RhoA, indicating transcriptional regulation, and the ability of a dominant negative p53 mutant to block Bax up-regulation implicates p53 in this response. The involvement of Bax in RhoA-induced apoptosis was examined by treatment with a Bax-inhibitory peptide, which was found to significantly attenuate DNA fragmentation and caspase-9 and -3 activation. The dominant negative p53 also prevents RhoA-induced apoptosis. We conclude that RhoA/Rho kinase activation up-regulates Bax through p53 to induce a mitochondrial death pathway and cardiomyocyte apoptosis."

https://openalex.org/W1965697531,"In the present study, we cloned a gene, designated bpsA, which encodes a single module type non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) from a d-cycloserine (DCS)-producing Streptomyces lavendulae ATCC11924. A putative oxidation domain is significantly integrated into the adenylation domain of the NRPS, and the condensation domain is absent from the module. When S. lividans was transformed with a plasmid carrying bpsA, the transformed cells produced a blue pigment, suggesting that bpsA is responsible for the blue pigment synthesis. However, to produce the blue pigment in Escherichia coli, the existence of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) gene from Streptomyces was necessary, in addition to bpsA. The chemical structure of the pigment was determined as 5,5′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-diazadiphenoquinone-(2,2′), called indigoidine. The bpsA gene product, designated BPSA, was overproduced in an E. coli host-vector system and purified to homogeneity, demonstrating that the recombinant enzyme prefers l-Gln as a substrate. The in vitro experiment using l-Gln also showed that the blue pigment was formed by the purified BPSA only when the enzyme was phosphopantetheinylated by adding a Streptomyces PPTase purified from E. coli cells. Each site-directed mutagenesis experiment of Lys598, Tyr601, Ser603, and Tyr608, which are seen in the oxidation domain of BPSA, suggests that these residues are essential for the binding of FMN to the protein and the synthesis of the blue pigment.

The genus Streptomyces is well known for its ability to produce an enormous variety of bioactive secondary metabolites, including clinically useful antibiotics.

Koerner S.K. Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 1976; 33: 275-283PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthesis genes for antibiotics, in general, form a cluster. In some cases, the final checkpoint in the transcriptional regulation of the cluster is controlled by a family of proteins called Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins (SARPs), which have been characterized as transcriptional activators (2Wietzorrek A. Bibb M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Many peptide antibiotics are known to be synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPSs, which are commonly found in microorganisms, are very large proteins containing sets of modules, each of which consists of various functional domains such as adenylation (A), condensation (C), cyclization (Cy), thiolation (T), and thioesterase (TE) domains (3Konz D. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 39-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the peptide antibiotic, which is produced by each NRPS, is determined by the order of the modules. When an NRPS, which is formed as an apoform, takes the holoform, the T-domain of apo-NRPS must be phosphopantetheinylated (4Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E.N. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification is catalyzed by a superfamily of enzymes known as 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTases), which transfer the phosphopantetheinyl group from CoA to a conserved serine residue of their T-domain (4Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E.N. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the process of peptide synthesis catalyzed by the holoform of NRPSs, individual amino acids are activated by the respective A-domains as amino acyl adenylates and subsequently are bound to the thiol group on the T-domains of the same modules. C-domains located downstream of each T-domain catalyze the condensation between the amino acid residues of adjacent modules so that a growing peptide chain moves from one module to the next until, finally, the completed peptide chain at the last module is released by the catalysis of the TE-domain (5Schwarzer D.

In this study, during our attempt to clone DCS biosynthesis genes from a DCS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC11924 by the suppression subtractive hybridization method, which is a cost-effective and powerful technique for the isolation of species-specific DNA sequences from closely related microorganisms (7Diatchenko L.

Lett. 1997; 156: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we unexpectedly found that a DCS producer-originated gene, designated bpsA, encodes a protein classified into the NRPS family. Interestingly, this NRPS, designated BPSA, is a single module type enzyme and contains an oxidation (Ox)-domain. Heterologous expression of bpsA in S. lividans and E. coli demonstrated that BPSA functions as a synthetase for a blue pigment, which was identified as a water-insoluble blue 3,3′-bipyridyl pigment, indigoidine (9Kuhn R. Starr M.P. Kuhn D.A. Bauer H. Knackmuss H.J. Arch. Mikrobiol. 1965; 51: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Mortimer P.S. Gladys C. Hans-Joachim K. Appl. Microbiol. 1966; 14: 870-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An in vitro study shows that the holotype of BPSA, which was activated by in vitro phosphopantetheinylation, catalyzes the synthesis of the blue pigment using l-Gln as a substrate. The enzymatic kinetic parameters of BPSA were also determined. Furthermore, by the mutational analysis of the Ox-domain in BPSA, amino acid residues, which may be important for the binding of cofactor FMN, were suggested. Finally, we suggest a possible mechanism whereby the blue pigment is synthesized by BPSA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that characterizes the single module type NRPS catalyzing a pigment synthesis. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—S. lavendulae ATCC11924 and S. lavendulae JCM4055 are a DCS producer and a DCS-non-producer, respectively. Both Streptomyces strains were grown at 28 °C in a YEME medium (11Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar) for the preparation of genomic DNA. S. lividans 66 was grown in a YEME medium containing 0.5% glycine at 28 °C for the preparation of protoplast. For blue pigment production, S. lavendulae ATCC11924 was cultured at 28 °C in medium B (12Yanagimoto M. Enatsu T. J. Ferment. Technol. 1983; 61: 545-550Google Scholar). Plasmid pIJ702 carrying the thiostrepton-resistance gene was used as a vector for S. lividans 66. Escherichia coli DH5α and pUC19 were used for DNA cloning and sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3), pET-21a(+), and pET-28a(+) (Novagen) were used for protein expression. Plasmid pSTV28 (TaKaRa), whose replication origin is derived from the pACYC184 vector, was used for the co-expression experiment. E. coli cells were grown in an LB medium (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

Probe labeling, hybridization, and detection were performed with the AlkPhos Direct Labeling and Detection system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Construction and Screening of Subtractive Hybridization Libraries—Subtractive hybridization between S. lavendulae ATCC11924 as a tester and S. lavendulae JCM4055 as a driver was carried out using a PCR-select bacterial genome subtraction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual, except that the hybridization temperature was set to 75 °C. The secondary PCR products, which were enriched for the S. lavendulae ATCC11924-specific DNA fragment, were subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and introduced into E. coli DH5α. Approximately 120 white colonies were randomly selected, and plasmid DNA was isolated from each clone. To eliminate nonspecific clones, each plasmid DNA was arrayed on Hybond-N+, and differential screening was conducted by dot-blot hybridization at 72 °C. In this case, AluI-digested genome DNAs from the tester and driver were used as probes. Ninety candidates carrying approximately a 0.5-kb DNA fragment specific to ATCC11924 were selected. The tester-specific DNA fragments obtained were analyzed to determine their nucleotide sequences followed by a BLAST search and Frame plot analysis (14Ishikawa J. Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 251-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four clones were selected by the above screening. A DNA fragment (0.5-kb) from one of four clones, designated SA49, was used for the cloning of a larger DNA fragment (see below). Cloning of a 6-kb BamHI DNA Fragment Containing the Subtracted Region from S. lavendulae ATCC11924—To clone the DNA fragment containing the subtracted region (SA49) from S. lavendulae ATCC11924, Southern hybridization was performed against restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA using the SA49 as a probe. The digestion with BamHI gave a single band having ∼6-kb. The DNA fragments were eluted from agarose gels, purified, ligated to the BamHI-digested pUC19, and introduced into E. coli DH5α. Positive clones, which were selected by colony hybridization, were finally confirmed by Southern hybridization. One of the positive clones, designated A49, was analyzed to determine its DNA sequence. DNA Sequencing and Homology Analysis of the Predicted Proteins—DNA sequencing was performed with ABI Prism 310 and 377 DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems) using the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit ver.1.1. The DNA and protein sequences were analyzed with GENETYX ver.7 for Windows (Software Development). The open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted using a FramePlot ver.2.3.2 (14Ishikawa J. Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 251-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A homology search was conducted with the FASTX program at DDBJ. The domain structure of the predicted protein was analyzed using the Conserved Domain data base and Search Service, v2.05, at NCBI. Expression of bpsA in S. lividans 66—A 4.8-kb DNA fragment containing bpsA (=orfB), which was obtained from the A49 clone by double digestion with BamHI and KpnI, was ligated to pIJ702-digested with BglII and KpnI to generate pIJA49/bpsA. After the chimeric plasmid was introduced into S. lividans 66 by the protoplast transformation, the resulting transformant was regenerated on an R5 medium (11Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). The regenerated candidate was inoculated into a YEME medium containing 50 μgof thiostrepton/ml and grown at 28 °C. Co-expression of bpsA in E. coli with the Gene svp Encoding a PPTase from S. verticillus—The gene bpsA was amplified by PCR with KOD-Plus-polymerase (TOYOBO) using a 5′-phosphorylated sense primer, 5′-catatgactcttcaggagaccagcgtgctc-3′ (the NdeI site is underlined), and a 5′-phosphorylated antisense primer, 5′-aagcttctcgccgagcaggtagcggatgtg-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The amplified bpsA was inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19 to yield pUC/bpsA. The bpsA was cut off from pUC/bpsA by digestion with NdeI and HindIII and inserted into the same sites of pET-28a(+) to generate pET/bpsA. The resulting BPSA was obtained as a product with a His6 tag at the N and C termini. The gene svp, which encodes a PPTase from S. verticillus (15Sanchez C. Du L. Edwards D.J. Toney M.D. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 725-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR from the S. verticillus genome using a 5′-phosphorylated sense primer, 5′-catatgatcgccgccctcctgccctcctg-3′ (the NdeI site is underlined), and a 5′-phosphorylated antisense primer, 5′-ctcgagcgggacggcggtccggtcgtccgc-3′ (the XhoI site is underlined). The amplified svp gene was inserted into the SmaI site of pUC19 to yield pUC/svp. The svp gene was removed from pUC/svp by digestion with NdeI and XhoI and inserted into the same sites of pET-21a(+) to give pET/svp. The Svp protein was obtained as a product with a His6 tag at the C terminus. A 2.2-kb DNA fragment, which contains svp under the control of the T7 promoter, was cut off from pET/svp by digestion with SphI and PvuI and inserted into the same sites of pSTV28 to yield pSTV/svp. The chimeric plasmids, pET/bpsA and pSTV/svp, were introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). Co-expression of bpsA with svp in E. coli was performed at 18 °C. Purification and Chemical Properties of the Blue Pigment— Production of the blue pigment in S. lavendulae ATCC11924 was induced by γ-nonalactone. 3M. Sugiyama, unpublished data. A culture broth (2 liter) of the strain at 2 h after induction by γ-nonalactone was centrifuged (4,400 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) to remove the mycelium, and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min) to collect the blue pigment. The pigment was washed twice with water and methanol and dried in vacuo. The pigment was dissolved in Me2SO under ultrasonication and filtered through a DISMIC-13JP filter (ADVANTEC), and 5 volumes of water were added. By centrifugation (30,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min), the precipitated blue pigment was collected, washed ten times with water, twice with methanol, and dried in vacuo, yielding 11 mg of blue pigment. For visible spectral analysis, the purified blue pigment was dissolved in Me2SO, N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and pyridine with sonication. The visible spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer (JASCO). For the analysis of the molecular mass by electron impact (EI)-MS, the blue pigment was dissolved in THF and subjected to a JEOL JMS-SX102A spectrometer (JEOL). For the same analysis by MALDI-TOF, the pigment was dissolved in Me2SO and subjected to Voyager™ RP-3 (Applied Biosystems). 1H NMR was recorded on a JEOL-JNM-LA500 spectrometer (JEOL) using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. The blue pigment was dissolved in deuterated Me2SO. The IR spectrum of the blue pigment, run as a potassium bromide tablet, showed the following frequencies: 3443, 3328, 3288, 3196, 3064, 2959, 2924, 2869, 2839, 2364, 1688, 1639, 1596, 1579, 1454, 1371, 1323, 1250, 1118, 1060, 1037, 956, 885, 824, 779, 752, 718, 689, 661, and 634 in wave number. Overexpression in E. coli and Purification of BPSA and BPSAΔTE—For the production of BPSAΔTE (1–1014), which lacks the TE-domain, the expression vector for bpsAΔTE was constructed using pET-28a(+) in the same way as the full-length bpsA, generating pET/bpsAΔTE. The PCR primers used were a 5′-phosphorylated sense primer, which was used in bpsA amplification, and a 5′-phosphorylated antisense primer, 5′-aagcttctgggcgacctcgcgctccag-3′ (the HindIII site is underlined). The BPSAΔTE protein was produced with the His6 tag at both the N and C termini. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET/bpsA or pET/bpsAΔTE were grown in 2.5 liters of an LB medium supplemented with Km at 18 °C. Cultivation was performed without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 30 h. Cells were suspended in a binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole) and disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was applied on a His-Bind resin column (1 × 10 cm, Novagen) and then washed with a wash buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 30 mm imidazole). Elution was done with a linear gradient concentration of 30–500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the BPSA or BPSAΔTE were collected and dialyzed against a binding buffer containing 1 mm EDTA (twice) and subsequently against a binding buffer (twice). The dialysate was reapplied on a flesh His-Bind resin column. The column was washed with wash buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, and 60 mm imidazole). Elution was conducted with a 60–1000 mm imidazole. Each protein purified to homogeneity was stored at -20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol until use. Overexpression in E. coli and Purification of Svp—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET/svp were grown in 3 liters of an LB medium supplemented with Ap at 23 °C. Cultivation was performed without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 24 h. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant fluid was applied on a His-Bind resin column (1 × 10 cm). After the column was washed with wash buffer II, elution was conducted with 60–500 mm imidazole. The purified Svp protein was stored at -20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol until use. ATP/PPi Exchange Assay—To evaluate the acyl-adenylation of NRPS, amino acid-dependent ATP/PPi exchange assays were performed as described previously (16Du L. Chen M. Zhang Y. Shen B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9731-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The assay solution (100 μl) contained 300 nm His6-tagged protein, 5 mm ATP, 1.72 μm [32P]PPi (1 μCi, 60 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer), 1 mm PPi, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm amino acid, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. After 20 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 0.9 ml of a charcoal suspension containing 0.25 m perchloric acid, 1.6% activated charcoal, and 0.1 m tetrasodium pyrophosphate. The charcoal was washed twice with 1 ml of distilled water and resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled water. After addition of liquid scintillation fluid (ACSII; Amersham Biosciences), the radioactivity was measured. The reaction mixture without the amino acid substrate was used as a control. To determine the kinetic parameters, reactions were carried out in various concentrations of l-Gln for 6 min. Experiments in which ATP was varied (7.8 μm - 2 mm) at fixed l-Gln concentrations (3 mm) gave a Km value of 192 ± 13 μm. Thus, the ATP concentration (5 mm) used in the kinetic studies for l-Gln is saturating. PPi Release Assay—The PPi release rate by the A-domain was measured by a coupled continuous-spectrophotometric assay using the EnzChek Pyrophosphate Assay kit (Molecular Probes). The reactions contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm MesG, 0.2 units of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 0.2 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase, 5 mm ATP, 3 mm l-Gln, 100 nm Svp, 0.5 mm CoA, and 100 nm BPSA. For the conversion of the apoform to the holoform, BPSA was preincubated with Svp at 30 °C for 30 min without l-Gln and ATP. The reactions were started by the addition of l-Gln and ATP and monitored every 10 s for 6 min at 360 nm. The slope of 0–100 s was correlated with a standard curve created with PPi. Assays for Amino Acylation of l-[14C]Gln to the T-domain of BPSAΔTE—The loading of l-[14C]Gln to the T-domain of BPSAΔTE was investigated by autoradiography. The reaction of 100 μl in volume contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm ATP, 10 μm l-[14C]Gln (0.2 μCi, 210 mCi/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals), 300 nm Svp, 0.5 mm CoA, and 300 nm BPSA or BPSAΔTE and was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C to allow the phosphopantetheinylation of the T-domain prior to initiation by the addition of l-[14C]Gln. At 15 min after addition of l-[14C]Gln, the reaction was quenched with 0.8 ml of 10% cold trichloroacetic acid containing 2% bovine serum albumin. The precipitated protein was washed with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid and acetone and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The dried gel was exposed on an imaging plate and visualized by BAS-2000. In Vitro Synthesis of the Blue Pigment—To phosphopantetheinylate BPSA, a solution (1.4 ml) containing 660 nm BPSA, 810 nm Svp, 0.1 mm CoA, and 1 mm MgCl2, which was prepared in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Synthesis of the blue pigment was initiated by addition of 200 μl of 10 mm ATP (final 1 mm) and 400 μl of 5 mm l-amino acid (final 1 mm). The in vitro synthesis of the blue pigment was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 590 nm. The molecular mass of the synthesized blue pigment was analyzed by MALDI-TOF as described above. MS/MS Analysis—A reaction mixture consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1.5 μm BPSA, 2 μm Svp, 1 mm CoA, and 1 mm MgCl2 was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. 4′-phosphopantetheinylated BPSA was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the corresponding band was cut off from the gel. After digestion of the protein contained in the gel by trypsin (Promega), the resulting peptide preparation was desalted with ZipTip (Millipore) and analyzed using an AXIMA-QIT (Shimadzu) mass spectrometer. A peak (m/z = 2921), which corresponds to a peptide ENASVQDDFFESGGNSLIAVGLVR (Ser972 is underlined) containing the carbamidemethylated 4′-phosphopantetheinyl residue, was used as a precursor ion for the MS/MS analysis. Mutagenic Analysis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange II XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. The mutation in bpsA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutants of BPSA were overproduced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified in the same way as wild-type BPSA. HPLC Analysis—HPLC for the analysis of the BPSA cofactor was performed using a Hydrosphere C18 column (4.6 × 200 mm, YMC). The run was conducted by a gradient elution with a 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 0.1% acetonitrile (from 90 to 30%) and methanol (from 10 to 70%) for 30 min at the flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The sequence reported has been deposited in the DDBJ data base under the accession number AB240063. Finding an NRPS Gene in a DCS Producer S. lavendulae ATCC11924—To clone biosynthesis genes for DCS, we enriched DNA fragments specific to DCS-producing S. lavendulae ATCC11924 using a PCR-based subtractive hybridization method. We could not find the clone carrying the DCS biosynthesis genes. Instead, we noticed a clone harboring a 0.5-kb DNA fragment, designated SA49: a portion of the protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence had a 70% similarity to a putative regulatory protein of actinorhodin-producing S. coelicolor (11Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar). We assumed that the protein encoded in SA49 may control some biosynthesis genes for secondary metabolites in S. lavendulae ATCC11924. Because the regulatory genes are generally clustered with the biosynthesis genes for secondary metabolites (11Kieser T. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK2000Google Scholar), a 6-kb BamHI-digested DNA fragment was newly cloned from the genome of S. lavendulae ATCC11924 using the SA49 DNA fragment as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1, the nucleotide sequence and FramePlot analyses (14Ishikawa J. Hotta K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 251-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the 5913-bp DNA suggest the presence of two complete ORFs, named orfB and orfC, and two incomplete ones (orfA and orfD). The incomplete orfA starts out of the sequenced region. A portion of a deduced protein consisting of 193 amino acids showed high identity (60–80%) to some bacterial ribose phosphate pyrophosphokinases. The complete orfB consists of 3849 bp. A putative ribosome-binding site (RBS), AGGAAG, was found upstream of the start codon. The protein, encoded by orfB, consists of 1282 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 141 kDa and exhibits a significant similarity to a large number of NRPS. In particular, the protein displays a similarity with NRPSs, designated IndC (17Reverchon S. Rouanet C. Expert D. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number CAB87990) from Erwinia chrysanthemi (57% identity) and IgiD (GenBank™ accession number AAD54007) from Vogesella indigofera (46% identity). Because orfB was found to encode a synthetase of a blue pigment, as described below, we renamed the gene as bpsA (blue pigment synthetase-encoding gene A). The gene orfC, which consists of 789 bp, encodes a protein of 262 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 29.5 kDa. The upstream region of orfC contains a potent RBS of AGGAG. The orfC gene product shows a significant similarity to the SARP family, which controls the secondary metabolism in Streptomyces sp (2Wietzorrek A. Bibb M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1181-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The highest similarity (59% identity) was seen with the actinorhodin operon activator protein (ActII-Orf4) from S. coelicolor (18Fernandez-Moreno M.A. Caballero J.L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Cell. 1991; 66: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), suggesting that the orfC-encoded protein may act as a transcriptional activator. The orfD gene ends out of sequence, and the deduced protein (63 amino acids), which is an N-terminal region of the protein, shows 97% identity to the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase from S. spectabilis (GenBank™ accession number Q9X4Q2). bpsA Encodes a Single Module Type NRPS—Because the bpsA gene product, designated BPSA, exhibits a significant similarity to a large number of NRPS, the domain structural search of BPSA was carried out using the Conserved Domain Search Program (NCBI). We found that BPSA contains an A-domain, a T-domain, and a TE-domain at the C-terminal end; thus, the protein appears to be an NRPS of a single module type. Importantly, there is a putative Ox-domain integrated into the A-domain between the A8 and A9 signature sequences of the A-domain, and the C-domain is absent from the BPSA (Fig. 1). The motif sequences of each domain in BPSA are summarized in Table 1. The Ox-domain in BPSA exhibits similarity with those of EpoB (19Schneider T.L. Shen B. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9722-9730Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and BlmIII (16Du L. Chen M. Zhang Y. Shen B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9731-9740Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which are involved in the biosynthesis of epothilone and bleomycin, respectively (20Chen H.W. O'Conner S. Cane D.E.

https://openalex.org/W1976877406,"Voltage-gated sodium channels control the upstroke of the action potential in excitable cells of nerve and muscle tissue, making them ideal targets for exogenous toxins that aim to squelch electrical excitability. One such toxin, tetrodotoxin (TTX), blocks sodium channels with nanomolar affinity only when an aromatic Phe or Tyr residue is present at a specific location in the external vestibule of the ion-conducting pore. To test whether TTX is attracted to Tyr401 of NaV1.4 through a cation-π interaction, this aromatic residue was replaced with fluorinated derivatives of Phe using in vivo nonsense suppression. Consistent with a cation-π interaction, increased fluorination of Phe401, which reduces the negative electrostatic potential on the aromatic face, caused a monotonic increase in the inhibitory constant for block. Trifluorination of the aromatic ring decreased TTX affinity by ∼50-fold, a reduction similar to that caused by replacement with the comparably hydrophobic residue Leu. Furthermore, we show that an energetically equivalent cation-π interaction underlies both use-dependent and tonic block by TTX. Our results are supported by high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations applied to a model of TTX binding to benzene. Our analysis suggests that the aromatic side chain faces the permeation pathway where it orients TTX optimally and interacts with permeant ions. These results are the first of their kind to show the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into a voltage-gated sodium channel and demonstrate that a cation-π interaction is responsible for the obligate nature of an aromatic at this position in TTX-sensitive sodium channels.

Sodium channels control electrical excitability in muscle and nervous tissues by driving membrane depolarization during an action potential. These large (∼260 kDa) proteins have four homologous transmembrane domains that are arranged in a clockwise orientation around a central pore (1Dudley Jr., S.C. Chang N. Hall J. Lipkind G. Fozzard H.A. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Numerous sodium channel isoforms exist and share the common traits of being exceptionally sensitive to voltage and selective for Na+ ions (2Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). They can, however, differ in expression patterns, inactivation time course, sensitivity to toxins, and effects of auxiliary subunits. In terms of extracellular block by the guanidinium toxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), 2The abbreviations used are: TTX, tetrodotoxin; aa, amino acids; NVOC, nitroveratryloxycarbonyl; WT, wild type. 2The abbreviations used are: TTX, tetrodotoxin; aa, amino acids; NVOC, nitroveratryloxycarbonyl; WT, wild type. sodium channels have been deemed binary in their sensitivity; they are either TTX-sensitive, blocked by low nanomolar concentrations, or TTX-resistant with blocking constants in the micromolar range (3Goldin A.L.

Members of the former class include isoforms expressed in brain (NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.3), skeletal muscle (NaV1.4), and peripheral nervous system (NaV1.6 and NaV1.7); the latter class includes isoforms of cardiac muscle (NaV1.5) and sensory neurons (NaV1.8 and NaV1.9). A number of point mutations in the external vestibule of the channel can substantially disrupt TTX binding (4Noda M. Suzuki H. Numa S. Stuöhmer W.

It has been established, however, that a single aromatic residue conserved in the first homologous domain (DI) of TTX-sensitive isoforms underlies isoform-specific block (9Satin J. Kyle J.W. Chen M.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), confirming the importance for TTX block of Phe or Tyr at this position.Many pore blockers mimic a channel permeant ion and occlude conduction by taking its place in the permeation pathway. In the present example, the charged guanidinium moiety of TTX may replace sodium at the external mouth of the channel. Therefore an understanding of block by TTX and other guanidinium toxins holds the promise of providing insight into the molecular architecture of the permeation pathway. The sodium channel selectivity filter has been hypothesized to be formed in part by the side chains of Asp, Glu, Lys, and Ala, one from each of the four homologous domains, DI–DIV, respectively (12Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stuöhmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 13Schlief T. Schoönherr R. Imoto K. Heinemann S.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 25: 75-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The DEKA locus is assisted by an outer ring of negative charges that electrostatically focus sodium ions toward the mouth of the selectivity filter (14Chiamvimonvat N. Pé;rez-García M.T. Tomaselli G.F. Marban E. J. Physiol. 1996; 491: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 15Hui K. McIntyre D. French R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 63-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues in either the inner or outer ring decrease TTX affinity and alter single channel conductance (5Terlau H. Heinemann S.H. Stuöhmer W. Pusch M. Conti F. Imoto K. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 16Chiamvimonvat N. Pé;rez-García M.T. Ranjan R. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1037-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), suggesting that the TTX binding site overlaps with the extracellular entrance of the permeation pathway. The aromatic residue of interest for the current work, Tyr401 in NaV1.4, is located between the two aforementioned charged rings, and its replacement with cysteine reduces single channel conductance (10Chen L-Q. Chahine M. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Horn R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), further suggesting a role for this site in sodium permeation. The homologous residue in the TTX-resistant cardiac isoform NaV1.5, a cysteine, underlies sensitivity to extracellular pore block by heavy metals (11Backx P.H. Yue D.T. Lawrence J.H. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. Science. 1992; 257: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 17Favre I. Moczydlowski E. Schild L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3110-3125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).An aromatic side chain may interact with a large organic cation like TTX through a combination of forces, including an induced dipole in the toxin and the aromatic, donor-acceptor, charge-transfer, and dispersion forces, as well as hydrophobic effects (18Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). Electrostatic energy may also be provided by the attraction between the negative electrostatic potential on the face of the aromatic ring and the guanidinium moiety of TTX, an affinity termed the cation-π interaction (18Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar, 19Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). This possibility was suggested previously to account for the importance of an aromatic residue in TTX block (9Satin J. Kyle J.W. Chen M. Bell P. Cribbs L.L. Fozzard H.A. Rogart R.B. Science. 1992; 256: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar).Traditional site-directed mutagenesis is not helpful in discriminating among the many energetic components of binding, because outright amino acid substitution tends to change hydrophobicity, structure, polarizability, and electrostatics concurrently. These shortcomings are readily averted by employing in vivo nonsense suppression to incorporate unnatural amino acids with subtle structural changes (21Nowak M.W. Gallivan J.P. Silverman S.K. Labarca C.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 504-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This method has been used previously to test for cation-π interactions by incorporating a series of progressively fluorinated aromatic derivatives into the ligand binding pockets of a variety of ion channels (22Zhong W.G. Gallivan J.P. Zhang Y.N. Li L.T. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 23Beene D.L. Brandt G.S. Zhong W. Zacharias N.M.

Biol. 2006; 1: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have also used this approach to explore extracellular block of potassium channels by cationic tetraethylammonium (26Ahern C.A. Eastwood A.L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The principle underlying this strategy is simple. Each fluorine atom substitution progressively reduces the negative electrostatic potential on the face of the aromatic, thereby reducing the electrostatic component of binding affinity. For studies of this kind, unnatural amino acids are clearly superior to their traditional counterparts. Serial fluorination does not substantially change the size, shape, polarizability, or hydrophobicity of the aromatic side chain (18Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar, 27Leo A. Hansch C. Elkins D. Chem. Rev. 1971; 71: 525-616Crossref Scopus (4263) Google Scholar), so any loss in binding energy is caused by cation-π electrostatics.In the present study, we used the in vivo nonsense suppression method to introduce a series of progressively fluorinated Phe residues at position 401 in NaV1.4 and assayed the resulting channels for their sensitivity to TTX. Stepwise fluorination monotonically increased the equilibrium binding constant, as observed in other known organic cation-π systems. Furthermore, complete neutralization of the negative electrostatic potential of the aromatic face by trifluorination of the aromatic side chain resulted in a TTX block that was similar to replacement of Phe401 by Leu, suggesting that hydrophobicity alone cannot explain high affinity block. Analysis of the blocking kinetics reveals that withdrawal of π electrons from the aromatic face of Phe401 is manifested primarily as a decrease in the association rate constant for TTX block. These results demonstrate that Phe401 interacts with TTX through a substantial cation-π interaction which, along with other energetic contributions, supports high affinity block in TTX-sensitive isoforms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology and Unnatural Amino Acids—The channel we used, rNaV1.4-pBSTA, was a gift from Drs. Baron Chanda and Francisco Bezanilla. The in vivo nonsense suppression methodology was performed as described previously (26Ahern C.A. Eastwood A.L. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Horn R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 649-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Nowak M.W. Kearney P.C. Sampson J.R. Saks M.E. Labarca C.G. Silverman S.K. Zhong W. Thorson J. Abelson J.N. Davidson N. Schultz P.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Science. 1995; 268: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tyr401 of the NaV1.4 cDNA was mutated into a TAG nonsense (stop) codon by conventional mutagenesis (Stratagene), and complementary mRNA was transcribed from this cDNA (mMessage mMachine, Ambion). Unnatural amino acids (aa) were protected with nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC), activated as the cyanomethyl ester, coupled to the dinucleotide dCA, and then ligated to a modified tRNA from Tetrahymena thermophila. This tRNA contains the complementary anti-codon to the UAG stop site within the NaV1.4-Y401UAG cRNA. Deprotection of the aminoacylated tRNA-aa was performed by UV irradiation immediately before injection into Stage V–VI Xenopus oocytes. Typically, 20 ng of tRNA-aa, 25 ng of NaV1.4-401UAG cRNA, and 2 ng of sodium channel β1-subunit cRNA (29Cannon S.C. McClatchey A.I. Gusella J.F. Pflugers. 1993; 423: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were co-injected in a 50-nl volume into each oocyte.The present study employed phenylalanine amino acid derivatives with one, two or three appended fluorines termed 3F1-Phe (single fluorination at the 3 position), 3,5F2-Phe (fluorination at the 3 and 5 positions), 3,4,5F3-Phe (fluorination at the 3, 4, and 5 positions). For clarity we refer to the monofluorinated derivative at the meta position as 3F1-Phe. However, it is possible that the fluorine may occupy the 3 or the 5 position depending on incorporation stereochemistry.Electrophysiology and Analysis—Whole oocyte sodium current was recorded with the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique using an OC-725C voltage clamp (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) in a standard Ringers solution (in mm): 116 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. Recording electrodes were filled with a 3 m KCl solution and had a resistance equal to or less than 1 mΩ. Perfusion experiments were performed with an ALA VM8 (ALA Scientific) gravity-flow delivery system. A TTX stock (1 mm in H2O) was stored at -20 °C. TTX working dilutions were made fresh each day from this stock. Inhibitory constants (Ki) of the resting and stimulated channels were obtained using a 2-Hz protocol (100 pulses of 10-ms duration to -10 mV from a holding potential of -100 mV) after a quiescent period of 3 min. The first pulse in this train assays the resting (tonic) block by TTX, and the 100th pulse elicits stimulated block (Fig. 4A). The time course of TTX dissociation (washoff) was obtained by exposing the oocyte to a TTX concentration producing block in the range of 30–75%, and stimulated at 2 Hz. Once the high affinity stimulated state was achieved, perfusion was switched to a TTX-free bath solution and washout was observed as an exponential increase in peak current.The time course and extent of use-dependent block were analyzed according a previously established framework (7Boccaccio A. Moran O. Imoto K. Conti F. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Conti F. Gheri A. Pusch M. Moran O. Biophys.

J. 2003; 84: 2999-3006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Three rate constants underlying toxin block were estimated, as well as two inhibitory constants for each mutation at position 401. The tonic (low affinity) and stimulated (high affinity) states have dissociation rate constants of kLoff and kHoff, respectively. A single association rate constant kon applies to both states, because dissociation of the toxin from the channel is assumed to cause a rapid conversion of all channels to the low affinity state (30Conti F. Gheri A. Pusch M. Moran O. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1295-1312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The two inhibitory constants KLi and KHi were estimated from the fraction of TTX block before and after 2-Hz stimulation, respectively, using fits to dose-response curves of block, except for the natural mutant Y401C, where the effect of a single [TTX] was used to estimate KLi and KHi. The rate constant kHoff is the inverse of the time constant of washoff during high-frequency stimulation, kon is estimated as the ratio kHoff/KHi, and kLoff is the product konKLi.Free Energy Computations—For ab initio, molecular mechanics, and mixed-mode calculations, respectively, we used the programs Jaguar and MacroModel and QSite. The structure of the monovalent cation TTX was optimized at the HF/6-31G**++ level (Fig. 1A). The electrostatic potential at the surface of hydrated TTX (Fig. 1B) was determined using a self-consistent reaction field method with the Poisson-Boltzmann solver in Jaguar. The energetic consequences of fluorinating the aromatic ring on TTX binding were calculated as follows. We first optimized the geometry for binding of TTX to benzene at the HF/6-31G*++ level in the gas phase. This geometry was maintained for all fluorinated derivatives of benzene. We then computed the Gibbs free energy of TTX binding at the HF/6-31G**++ level, accounting both for the gas-phase ab initio energies, as well as the energies of hydration, using the aforementioned Poisson-Boltzmann solver (Table 1; for example, see Ref. 32Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 870-874Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). No correction was made for basis set superposition error.FIGURE 1Structure of TTX. A, energy-minimized structure; B, surface rendering of TTX with electrostatic potential ranging from +100 kcal/mol (blue) to +40 kcal/mol (red).

All values are in kcal/mol. Δ E is the binding energy of TTX to the benzene derivatives (Fn-Benzene, where n = number of fluorines) calculated in the gas phase. The energy caused by monofluorination (F1-Benzene) was calculated from the average energies of 3F1-Benzene and 5F1-Benzene, which differed because of the asymmetric structure of TTX (Fig. 6). The hydration energies for TTX, benzene derivatives, and the TTX-benzene complex were calculated using a Poisson-Boltzmann equation solver. ΔGsolv is the change in solvation free energy caused by TTX binding to the benzene derivative. ΔGbinding = ΔE +ΔGsolv is the Gibbs free energy of TTX binding, and ΔΔG is the effect of fluorination on TTX binding.ΔE (gas)Hydration EnergiesΔGsolvΔGbindingΔΔGTTXFn-BenzeneComplexF0-Benzene–7.91–89.88–1.59–77.8713.65.690F1-Benzene–5.14–89.88–2.09–79.9512.026.881.193,5F2-Benzene–2.14–89.88–2.22–81.5110.598.452.763,4,5F3-Benzene0.14–89.88–2.79–82.969.719.854.16 Open table in a new tab To determine the geometry of the TTX-bound intermediate of Fig. 6, we used the molecular model of Lipkind and Fozzard (33Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Mol. Pharm. 2005; 68: 1611-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) for the outer mouth of the sodium channel pore. TTX bound to benzene, optimized at the quantum mechanical level, was aligned with the aromatic ring of Tyr401. The TTX-benzene complex can be oriented in 6 ways due to the 6-fold symmetry of the aromatic ring. Of these, we chose the minimum energy conformation determined by MacroModel using the OPLS2005 force field (34Kaminski G.A. Friesner R.A. Tirado-Rives J. Jorgensen W.L. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 6474-6487Crossref Scopus (3109) Google Scholar). This structure was further refined by a mixed-mode Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) optimization in which the Tyr401 side chain and TTX were treated at the QM level (HF/6–31G*), and the rest of the structure was treated at the MM level (OPLS2001 force field) with water represented as a continuum. For this calculation TTX and the Tyr401 side chain were free to move, but the coordinates of all other atoms of the channel were fixed.FIGURE 6Model of TTX docking in the pore mouth of Nav1.4. A, top view of TTX interacting with the pore loops of domains DI-DIV in the Lipkind-Fozzard model (33Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Mol.

Specifically, high-affinity block requires the presence a Tyr or Phe at position 401 in the pore loop of domain DI of the rat NaV1.4 channel from skeletal muscle (9Satin J. Kyle J.W. Chen M. Bell P.

We set out here to measure the energetic contribution of a potential cation-π interaction between TTX and the aromatic face of residue 401. A substantial cation-π interaction would provide insight into both the orientation of this residue in the extracellular mouth of the channel and of TTX in its blocking site. To this end, we substituted electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms for hydrogen atoms on the aromatic ring of residue 401, creating a series of fluorinated analogues of Phe. The functional equivalence of Phe and Tyr at the 401 position with respect to TTX block (Table 2) allows us to employ analogs of Phe in our analysis.TABLE 2Affinity and kinetics of TTX block in tonic and stimulated states Rate constants (kHoff, kLoff, and kon) and equilibrium inhibitory constants (KLi and KHi) were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number of cells is enclosed in parentheses.KLi TonicKHi StimkLoff TonickHoff Stimkonnmnms–1s–1s–1 μm–1WT (Tyr401)19 ± 6 (5)6 ± 1 (5)0.13 ± .04 (5)0.037 ± .002 (4)6.84 ± 0.79 (9)Y401F25 ± 2 (4)5 ± 0.9 (4)0.161 ± 0.017 (4)0.033 ± 0.001 (4)6.58 ± 0.17 (4)PheaThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression25 ± 3 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression7 ± 0.9 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.1545 ± 0.0128 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.040 ± 0.004 (5)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression6.13 ± 1.04 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression3F1-PheaThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression49 ± 7 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression10 ± 1 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.208 ± 0.032 (5)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.040 ± 0.002 (5)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression4.08 ± 0.46 (5)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression3,5F2-PheaThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression316 ± 32 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression93 ± 9 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.642 ± 0.064 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.181 ± 0.019 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression2.04 ± 0.27 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression3,4,5F3-PheaThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression974 ± 61 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression350 ± 28 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.352 ± 0.022 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.134 ± 0.032 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppression0.361 ± 0.058 (6)aThese mutants were generated by nonsense suppressionY401L2070 ± 223 (6)1006 ± 104 (6)0.363 ± 0.082 (4)0.171 ± 0.031 (4)0.209 ± 0.052 (4)Y401C108,000 ± 14,000 (4)108,000 ± 14,000 (4)a These mutants were generated by nonsense suppression Open table in a new tab An energy-minimized structure (A) and the color-coded electrostatic potential (B) of TTX are shown in Fig. 1. Although a monovalent cation at neutral pH, TTX also has a large dipole moment of ∼10 D, with an excess of positive charge (blue) near the guanidinium group. This would be expected to affect the orientation of TTX because of electrostatic interactions with its binding site.Fig. 2 shows representative examples of inward sodium currents elicited by depolarizations from -30 mV to +10 mV in 5-mV steps from a holding potential of -100 mV. The Y401F mutant (Fig. 2A) was constructed by standard site-directed mutagenesis, while the remaining panels show currents for mutations introduced by nonsense suppression in which the cRNA encoding for NaV1.4 was identical, containing a UAG codon at position 401. Fig. 2, B–E, shows the similarity of sodium currents co-expressing this cRNA construct with suppressor tRNAs ligated to the indicated derivatives of Phe. The peak current-voltage relationships from the fluorinated unnatural amino acids resulted in less than 5-mV shifts in activation compared with wild-type channels (data not shown). Injection of NaV1.4-401UAG cRNA without a complementary suppressor tRNA failed to produce sodium currents (Fig. 2F), allowing us to rule out enzymatic manipulation within the oocyte expression system resulting in the incorporation of unexpected and unwanted natural amino acids. As a further control, no sodium current was seen when a complementary tRNA lacking an appended amino acid was co-injected with the NaV1.4-401UAG cRNA.FIGURE 2Representative current traces from either Y401F or channels con"

Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying changes in mammalian zinc transporter mRNA abundance is poor. We demonstrated that when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells as N-terminal fusions to green fluorescent protein, two splice variants of ZnT5 adopt different subcellular locations (either in the Golgi apparatus or throughout the cell, including at the plasma membrane) indicating discrete roles in cellular zinc homeostasis. We demonstrated, using a β-galactosidase reporter gene, that both splice variants were expressed from a promoter region that was transcriptionally repressed by increased extracellular zinc (150 μm compared with 3 μm; ∼40%) and by extracellular zinc depletion, using the chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (∼20%). We mapped the zinc-responsive element to the region -154 to +50, relative to the predicted start of transcription, and showed that a consensus metal response element sequence (-410 to -404) was not responsible for these effects. Changes in ZnT5 mRNA abundance in Caco-2 cells at different zinc concentrations were in parallel to the changes in promoter activity (∼40% reduction at 150 μm zinc) but in the presence of actinomycin D, to prevent transcription, we observed a marked stabilization (1.7–2-fold accumulation over 24 h) of ZnT5 mRNA. We conclude that effects of zinc on ZnT5 transcription and mRNA stability act in opposition to balance mRNA abundance for cellular zinc homeostasis. To our knowledge, this is the first report that zinc affects the stability of a transcript with a direct role in cellular zinc homeostasis.

To our knowledge, this is the first report that zinc affects the stability of a transcript with a direct role in cellular zinc homeostasis. It is estimated that between 3 and 10% of human genes code for proteins with zinc binding domains (1Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. J. Proteome. Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 2Blasie C.A. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15068-15073Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These proteins include those in which zinc plays a role in protein structure, typified by the zinc finger domains of nucleic acid-binding proteins such as transcription factors, and those in which the redox stability and ability of zinc to form polyhedral coordination complexes with a variety of ligands is exploited in catalysis. Whole body and cellular zinc homeostasis is, therefore, essential and is achieved through mechanisms that include regulating the expression of cell membrane zinc transporters. Human zinc transporters are classified in two unrelated families, SLC30 and SLC39 (3Eide D.J. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The prevailing view is that members of the SLC30 family transport zinc in directions, which reduce cytosolic concentration, specifically out of the cell across the plasma membrane or into intracellular compartments, and that members of the SLC39 family function in the opposite direction to increase cytosolic zinc concentration by uptake across the plasma membrane or efflux form intracellular compartments. ZnT5 (SLC30A5) was cloned simultaneously by two groups, including our own (5Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol.

Both groups detected two major transcripts of ZnT5 by Northern blotting, and comparison of the two published sequences shows that they differ at both the 5′ and 3′ ends, with the variant cloned by our group (referred to hereafter as variant B) being the shorter transcript.

Other zinc transporter gene promoters, including SLC30A5, include consensus MRE sequences. A molecular mediator of zinc-induced transcriptional repression in mammalian systems has not yet been identified. The current study investigated the regulation by zinc of the two cloned splice variants of the SLC30A5 gene. We identify a common promoter region upstream of the first exon of variant A, which is transcriptionally repressed in response to both elevated and reduced extracellular zinc concentration, and demonstrate that a second mechanism, zinc-induced stabilization of ZnT5 mRNA, also contributes to the regulation of transcript abundance in response to zinc. We believe this is the first report of zinc-mediated zinc transporter regulation through effects on mRNA stability. Generation and Manipulation of Plasmid DNA Constructs— The ZnT5 variant A-specific probe (198 bp) was generated by PCR from human genomic DNA using Thermo-Start DNA polymerase (ABgene) and primers and thermal cycling parameters as stated in Table 1. The product was subcloned into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and identity to the required region was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). A large scale plasmid preparation (Plasmid Maxi kit, Qiagen) was digested with EcoRI, and the probe was purified from the band resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen).TABLE 1Primers and thermal cycling parameters for PCR Open table in a new tab Full-length cDNAs corresponding to ZnT5 splice variants A and B were generated by PCR or RT-PCR using KOD DNA polymerase (Novagen) with primers and thermal cycling parameters as stated in Table 1 and subcloned into the vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) to give plasmids pCR2.1-ZnT5A and pCR2.1-ZnT5B, respectively. The full-length cDNA corresponding to variant A was generated in three sections, which were spliced together. The template for the 5′ region was RNA from JAR cells. The template for the middle region was IMAGE clone 10213-g09. The template for the 3′ region was IMAGE clone 12254-j14. The middle and 3′ regions were spliced together in a PCR reaction using only the outermost primer pair and the product was then spliced to the 5′ region using the same strategy. The full-length cDNA corresponding to variant B was generated in two sections, which were spliced together. The template for the 5′ region was plasmid pZTL1-50 (5Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and the template for the 3′ region was RNA from JAR cells. Both cDNAs were subcloned in-frame into the vector pEGFPN (Clontech), to give plasmids pEGFP-ZnT5A and pEGFP-ZnT5B, respectively, for expression as N-terminal fusion to GFP (SacI and ApaI for variant A and EcoRI for variant B). Regions of genomic DNA sequence upstream of exons 1 (-2145 to +50 and -950 to +50, relative to the predicted start of transcription) and 3 (-2877 to +22 and -634 to +22, relative to the predicted start of transcription) of the SLC30A5 gene were generated by PCR from human genomic DNA using Thermo-Start DNA polymerase (ABgene), Expand High Fidelity (Roche), or Advantage Genomic Polymerase Mix (Clontech). Primer pairs and thermal cycling parameters were as specified in Table 1, and products were subcloned into the vector pBlue-TOPO (Invitrogen). Correct insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). Deletions to the 5′ end of the ZnT5 variant A promoter-reporter construct -950 to +50 were made using the original promoter-reporter construct as template to generate PCR products, using Expand High Fidelity (Roche) and primers and thermal cycling conditions as listed in Table 1, which were then subcloned into the vector pBlue-TOPO. The MRE at position -410 to -404 (TGCACTC) was mutated to a sequence different from the MRE consensus (CTGACTC) using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers as listed in Table 1. The mutated construct was sequenced to confirm successful replacement of the MRE sequence. The element AAGGCGAG at position -128 to -121 in the ZnT5 splice variant A promoter-reporter construct -950 to +50 was deleted using a PCR-based method based on generating two overlapping products using ThermoStart DNA polymerase (ABgene) and primers spanning the region to be removed and incorporating the deletion. These PCR products were then joined in a third PCR reaction by including only the outer pair of primers, and the product was subcloned into the vector pBlue-TOPO. Correct insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). The ZnT5 variant A region -950 to +164 (including an MRE consensus sequence in the 5′-UTR) was generated from human genomic DNA using Expand High Fidelity (Roche) and primers and thermal cycling parameters as specified in Table 1 and subcloned into the vector pBlue-TOPO. Correct insert orientation was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech). A human metallothionein 2a (MT2a) promoter-reporter construct, in the vector pBlue-TOPO, was generated as reported previously (10Helston R.M. Phillips S.R. McKay J.A. Jackson K.A. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Placenta. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blotting—A multiple tissue human Northern blot was purchased from BD Biosciences. For Northern blots of Caco-2 mRNA, total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the poly-A+ fraction was purified using the NucleoTrap mRNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoresis (1 μg/lane) through 1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels and capillary transfer to nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Biosciences) was as described previously (5Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Membranes were prehybridized for 20–30 min in Quickhyb (Statagene) before the addition of 25 ng of 32P-labeled probe (prepared using the Megaprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) and boiled for 2 min with 100 μl of salmon sperm DNA (100 ng/ml) before addition. Membranes were washed twice at 25 °C in 2× SSC (300 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, then once at 60 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and examined by autoradiography. Subcelluar Localization of GFP-tagged Constructs—For transfection into CHO cells, plasmids pEGFP-ZnT5A and pEGFP-ZnT5B were prepared using the EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 60 μg/ml gentamycin (all from Sigma) in 6-well plates on collagen-coated glass coverslips. Cells were transfected 24 h post-seeding, when ∼50% confluent, using GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions with a ratio of DNA to GeneJammer of 2 μg:5 μl. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. In some experiments cells were treated with ZnCl2 or TPEN (at the indicated concentrations) for 1 h prior to fixation. Cells were permeabilized by treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by a further phosphate-buffered saline wash. Cells were stained with 100 μg/ml rhodamine-labeled wheat germ agglutinin for 5 min at room temperature, then visualized by laser scanning confocal microscopy using a Leica TCS NT confocal microscope. Reporter Gene Assay—Caco-2 and JAR cells were cultured as described previously (5Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For transfection, cells were seeded into 12-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well and transfected 24 h after seeding with endotoxin-free preparations of reporter gene constructs (EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit, Qiagen) using GeneJammer transfection reagent (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instructions and using a ratio of DNA to transfection reagent of 1.75 μg:4.5 μl. Transfection medium was removed after 24 h and replaced with serum-free medium containing 1.1 μm TPEN or 3, 100, or 150 μm zinc as ZnCl2. Cell lysates were prepared after 24 h and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the substrate chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside, as described previously. Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Cell Viability Assay—Caco-2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 0.3 × 105 cells/well. Culture medium was removed 48 h after seeding and replaced with 100 μl of serum-free medium containing 1.1 μm TPEN or 3 or 150 μm ZnCl2. Cells were cultured for further 24 h, then 20 μl of CellTiter-Blue reagent (containing resazurin, which is reduced to resorufin by metabolically active cells; Promega) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and then absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Background absorbance (from wells without cells) was subtracted from all values. Real-time RT-PCR—ZnT5 transcript abundance, in samples of total RNA prepared from Caco-2 cells, was measured by real-time PCR after DNase treatment (Promega; following the manufacturer's instructions) and reverse transcription using Superscript III RNase H- reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen; following the manufacturer's instructions). Primers specific to ZnT5 and GAPDH (normalization control) were as listed in Table 1, and amplification was on a Roche Lightcycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science) using ABsolute QPCR SYBR Green Capillary mix (ABgene) using thermal cycling parameters as in Table 1. The amplification products from both primer pairs were sequenced (MWG Biotech) to confirm identity to the expected products. We generated a probe specific to ZnT5 splice variant A (or at least to variants including the same 5′ exon) by including only exon 1 (nucleotides 22–219) and probed a human multiple tissue Northern blot, revealing a major hybridizing transcript of ∼4 kb (Fig. 1B, i). Attempts to generate specific probes for regions unique to variant B were unsuccessful because of homology with other regions of the human genome, so we probed the same blot with a probe corresponding to the full-length variant B transcript, revealing two major transcripts, one corresponding exactly in position to that revealed by the variant A-specific probe and a second (slightly more abundant) transcript of ∼3 kb. Levels of the transcripts differed between different tissues as already reported (6Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and there were no obvious differences between tissues in the relative abundance of one transcript compared with the other. Previous reports of the subcellular localization of ZnT5 were based on the use of antibodies with the potential to cross-react with both variants (6Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K. Iwanaga T. Nagao M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19049-19055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R. Piper J.M. Varma J.S. Campbell F.C. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Gut. 2005; 54: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To confirm the reported difference in the pattern of subcellular localization of ZnT5 splice variants A and B, we expressed both transiently as N-terminal conjugates to GFP in the cell line CHO, selected because of the ease with which subcellular compartments could be viewed in these relatively cytoplasm-rich, flattened cells. Rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was used to stain the plasma membrane in unpermeabilized, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and to stain the Golgi apparatus in cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 following paraformaldehyde fixation. GFP-tagged ZnT5 splice variant A showed co-localization with wheat germ agglutinin in permeabilized cells, consistent with localization to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2, A, C, D, and E), whereas the pattern of localization of splice variant B was more diffuse, including co-localization with wheat germ agglutinin staining in unpermeabilized cells, indicating some localization at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). For both splice variants, there was no alteration in the pattern of localization by changing the extracellular zinc concentration in either serum-free medium (1.1 μm TPEN, 3 μm ZnCl2, 100 μm ZnCl2, 150 μm ZnCl2) or medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (5 μm TPEN, 3 μm zinc, 100 μm ZnCl2, 150 μm ZnCl2) for the 1 h period immediately prior to viewing the cells (data not shown). We find no evidence for zinc-induced intracellular trafficking of either ZnT5 splice variant. Based on the observation that the two alternative transcripts of ZnT5 incorporate different first exons, we hypothesized that transcription may be from different promoter regions, upstream of each first exon (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis we subcloned genomic regions immediately upstream of the first exon of each splice variant into the reporter vector pBlue-TOPO (Invitrogen) and measured reporter gene (β-galactosidase) activity in both the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 and the human placental cell line JAR. Constructs including regions -950 to +50 and -2145 to +50 (relative to the end of the 5′-UTR) immediately upstream of the first exon of splice variant A showed reporter gene activity significantly elevated above negative control (vector minus putative promoter region) in both Caco-2 and JAR cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, regions -2877 to +22 and -634 to +22 (relative to the end of the 5′-UTR) immediately upstream of the first exon of splice variant B (i.e. exon 3) were inactive in this respect (Fig. 3B). These observations indicate that both splice variants of the SLC30A5 gene are transcribed from a single promoter, upstream of the first exon of splice variant A. To investigate transcriptional regulation by zinc of the SLC30A5 gene, we measured the response of the active promoter region to changes in the extracellular zinc concentration in Caco-2 cells, adding the zinc chelator TPEN to reduce extracellular zinc concentration to below that of the serum-free tissue culture medium (0.7–0.8 μm; as determined by atomic absorption spectrometry) or adding Zn2+ as ZnCl2 to cells transfected with both the -950 to +50 and the -2145 to +50 promoter-reporter constructs for 24 h. Reporter gene activity was maximum at an extracellular zinc concentration of 3 μm and was reduced both by an increase in zinc concentration in a dose-responsive manner and by the addition of TPEN (Fig. 4, A and B). A potential effect on cell viability of TPEN at the concentration used (1.1 μm) and/or of 150 μm ZnCl2 was excluded by showing that neither treatment affected the ability of cells to reduce resazurin to resorufin (Fig. 4A, inset (i)). As a positive control, we carried out parallel experiments using the well characterized, zinc-responsive human MT2a promoter (-358 to +40) as the insert in the promoter-reporter construct, and as expected, reporter gene expression was increased at elevated zinc concentrations (Fig. 4A, inset (ii)). Mammalian zinc-responsive genomic elements responsible for transcriptional repression in response to elevated zinc concentration have not yet been identified so we sought to identify the region of the SLC30A5 promoter responsible for this effect. The promoter region -950 to +50 includes one metal response element consensus sequence (TGCRCNC) at position -410 to -404 (TGCACTC). Mutation of this region to a sequence no longer satisfying the core-consensus MRE motif (CTGACTC) had no measurable effect on the transcriptional response to zinc (Fig. 4A), allowing us to exclude this motif as mediating the zinc-induced transcriptional repression of the SLC30A5 promoter observed. We generated a series of progressive 5′ deletions of the SLC30A5 promoter region in the -950 to +50 promoter-reporter construct and observed that transcriptional repression in response to 150 μm zinc was retained in a construct including only the region -154 to +50, localizing the element responsible for zinc-induced transcriptional repression to this region. Removal of a further 38 nucleotides from the 5′ end of the promoter region (leaving nucleotides -116 to +50) resulted in a large reduction in promoter activity so that it was only slightly increased above negative control (data not shown). We identified an element on the antisense strand of the promoter (AAGGCGAG (antisense = CTCGCCTT); bases -128 to -121), which had been reported to be responsible for the inhibitory effect of a zinc-humic acid complex on activity of the human mitochondrial aconitase promoter (20Tsui K.H. Chang P.L. Juang H.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), so we removed this sequence from the -950 to +50 promoter-reporter construct using a PCR-based strategy and examined the effects on the response of the reporter gene to zinc. Deletion of this element had no measurable effect on the transcriptional response either to 150 μm zinc or to TPEN, so we excluded a role for this element in zinc-mediated transcriptional regulation of ZnT5. Finally, we demonstrated that the promoter region -154 to +50 showed a dose response to increased extracellular zinc concentration and a response to TPEN that was indistinguishable from that of the longer constructs -2145 to +50 and -950 to +50 (Fig. 4B), so we concluded that the region -154 to +50 contained all elements necessary to mediate the transcriptional down-regulation. Previous studies investigating the effect of changes in zinc availability on levels of ZnT5 mRNA have not distinguished between splice variants, so we used the variant A-specific probe on Northern blots to examine the response to zinc of transcripts including this region in Caco-2 cells. We also blocked gene transcription using actinomycin D to distinguish transcriptional and non-transcriptional effects of zinc on ZnT5 mRNA levels. In Caco-2 cells grown under conditions identical to those in which we measured reporter gene responses (24 h exposure of cells, 24 h post-transfection), increasing the extracellular zinc concentration produced a dose-dependent effect on ZnT5 variant A mRNA levels (Fig. 5A), parallel to the transcriptional repression observed using the promoter-reporter construct. As expected, MT2a transcript levels were increased at the elevated zinc concentrations (Fig. 5B). Addition of actinomycin D at 5 μg/ml along with the zinc treatment prevented the reduction in ZnT5 variant A mRNA expression, commensurate with this effect on mRNA levels being transcriptionally mediated. We observed a dose-dependent increase in ZnT5 transcript A mRNA levels in response to increased zinc availability in the presence of actinomycin D in Caco-2 cells, demonstrating an mRNA stabilizing effect of increased extracellular zinc concentration opposing the transcriptional response. The response of the MT2a transcript to increased extracellular zinc concentration in the presence of actinomycin D was attenuated dramatically (Fig. 5B), demonstrating efficacy of the actinomycin D treatment to block transcription. As already noted, attempts to generate ZnT5 splice variant B-specific probes were unsuccessful, so we used real-time RT-PCR, using primers annealing to the region of sequence shared by both splice variants, to measure the effect of changes in extracellular zinc concentration, in the presence and absence of actinomycin D, on total ZnT5 transcript levels. The response to increasing extracellular zinc concentration and to inhibition of transcription by the addition of actinomycin D had a similar profile as determined specifically for variant A by Northern blotting, reduced mRNA levels at elevated extracellular zinc concentration (150 μm but not 100 μm in this case) and increased ZnT5 transcript levels at the higher zinc concentrations in the presence of actinomycin D, demonstrating stabilization by zinc of ZnT5 mRNA. We demonstrate that splice variants of the SLC30A5 gene are differentially localized in the cell and are transcribed from a single promoter region, which is negatively regulated both by increased and depleted extracellular zinc concentration, relative to standard cell culture conditions. The zinc-responsive element(s) mediating both regulatory effects is within the region -154 to +50, relative to the start of transcription. Importantly, we demonstrate, for what we believe to be the first time, zinc-mediated stabilization of a transcript involved directly in zinc transport/homeostasis. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that splice variants of a zinc transporter gene occur at different subcellular localization, but evidence in the literature suggests that the existence of splice variants is not a phenomenon unique to ZnT5. For example, different laboratories, including our own, observed multiple bands or bands of different sizes in different tissues on Western blots using anti-ZnT1 antibodies (7Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R.

Repressed zinc transporter expression in response to increased zinc availability has been reported previously, most notably for ZIP4 (13Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but zinc-responsive promoter elements mediating such an effect and transcription factors binding to these elements have not yet been identified. The recent observation that the expression of Zip10, which includes MREs in the upstream region, is increased in the conditional MTF1 knockout mouse (23Wimmer U. Wang Y. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5715-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) indicates that MTF1 binding to MREs may mediate negative gene regulation, in addition to the well characterized transcriptional up-regulation. We have shown that mutation of the unique MRE at position -410 to -404 in the SLC30A5 promoter-reporter construct affected neither the transcriptional response to increased extracellular zinc nor that observed in the presence of the zinc chelator TPEN and so was responsible for neither effect. Analogous to the possible role of MTF1 in zinc-induced transcriptional repression, rather than activation, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor ZAP1, which characteristically mediates transcriptional activation by binding to elements with the zinc-responsive element consensus sequence in gene promoter regions, has been found to mediate zinc-induced transcriptional repression through binding to a zinc-responsive element downstream of the TATA box in the ZRT2 gene (24Bird A.J. Blankman E. Stillman D.J. Eide D.J. Winge D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1123-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The SLC30A5 gene included an element with the MRE core consensus sequence in the 5′-UTR but we excluded this as mediating the zinc-induced transcriptional repression because this response was observed regardless of whether or not this region was included in the promoter region upstream of the reporter gene. Similarly, deletion of the promoter element reported to underlie the negative regulatory effect of zinc-humic acid on the activity of the human mitochondrial aconitase promoter (20Tsui K.H. Chang P.L. Juang H.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) did not affect the profile of transcriptional regulation in response to zinc manipulation, so can be excluded as mediating these responses. The magnitude of the response of the SLC30A5 promoter-reporter construct to increased extracellular zinc concentration was modest, consistent with observations on the magnitude of the regulatory responses of mammalian macronutrient and micronutrient transporters to variations in their substrate supply, including dipeptides (25Walker D. Thwaites D.T. Simmons N.L. Gilbert H.J. Hirst B.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 697-706Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), amino acids (26Howard A. Goodlad R.A. Walters J.R. Ford D. Hirst B.H. J. Nutr. 2004; 134: 2957-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and iron (27Zoller H. Theurl I. Koch R. Kaser A. Weiss G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2002; 29: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Such responses are typically, although not without exception (e.g. Ref. 13Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), in the order of 1.5–2-fold. The magnitude of the measured transcriptional response to zinc is also commensurate with responses of zinc transporters, including ZnT5, to zinc availability observed in vivo (7Cragg R.A.

Presumably, such modest changes in nutrient transporter expression are generally adequate to maintain intracellular and/or whole-body nutrient homeostasis within physiologically encountered variations in the nutrient supply. As already noted, a particularly pertinent finding of the study was that ZnT5 mRNA was stabilized by increased extracellular zinc concentration. An earlier report in the literature identified zinc-induced mRNA stabilization of the labile c-fos and tristetrapolin mRNAs in TK-L cells (28Taylor G.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, we are unaware of any previous evidence that effects on mRNA stability is a mechanism through which zinc regulates the expression of genes involved directly in zinc metabolism and/or homeostasis. The ability of iron to destabilize RNAs, most notably transferrin, with the iron response element in the 3′-UTR is one of the classical examples of homeostatic regulation of mRNA stability (reviewed in Ref. 29Rouault T.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The finding that regulatory mechanism acting in the opposite direction (i.e. substrate mRNA stabilization rather than destabilization) contributes to the regulation of zinc transport provides an exciting area for future research. There are reports in the literature, including our own observations, of both increased and reduced ZnT5 expression in response to increased zinc availability (5Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R.

Placenta. 2006; PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rouault T.A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 406-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The identification here of two mechanisms that can act in opposition provides a plausible explanation for such apparently divergent responses. It would appear that the net effect on ZnT5 expression of changes in zinc availability under specific conditions reflects a balance between transcriptional repression and mRNA stabilization. This finding, along with the fact that ZnT5, present in the cell as differentially localized splice variant, functions in association with other, presumably regulated, zinc transporters reveals a level of complexity to cellular zinc homeostasis greater than that already indicated by the presence of multiple zinc transporters with potentially overlapping functions."

https://openalex.org/W2154843972,"Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is the most common dominant spinocerebellar ataxia. MJD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide expansion in the ATXN3 gene, which encodes a protein named ataxin-3. Ataxin-3 has been proposed to act as a deubiquitinating enzyme in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and to be involved in transcriptional repression; nevertheless, its precise biological function(s) remains unknown. To gain further insight into the function of ataxin-3, we have identified the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of the ATXN3 gene and characterized its pattern of expression, developmental regulation, and subcellular localization. We demonstrate that, analogous to its human orthologue, C. elegans ataxin-3 has deubiquitinating activity in vitro against polyubiquitin chains with four or more ubiquitins, the minimum ubiquitin length for proteasomal targeting. To further evaluate C. elegans ataxin-3, we characterized the first known knockout animal models both phenotypically and biochemically, and found that the two C. elegans strains were viable and displayed no gross phenotype. To identify a molecular phenotype, we performed a large-scale microarray analysis of gene expression in both knockout strains. The data revealed a significant deregulation of core sets of genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, structure/motility, and signal transduction. This gene identification provides important clues that can help elucidate the specific biological role of ataxin-3 and unveil some of the physiological effects caused by its absence or diminished function."

The overall structure of this protein is similar to those of bacterial subtilisin-propeptide complexes, except that the peptide bond linking the propeptide and mature domain contacts with the active site, and the mature domain contains six Ca2+ binding sites.

Four of them apparently contribute to the stability of the central αβα substructure of the mature domain. The CD spectra, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid fluorescence spectra, and sensitivities to chymotryptic digestion of this protein indicate that the conformation of pro-S324A is changed from an unstable molten globule-like structure to a stable native one upon Ca2+ binding.

Subtilisin is a serine protease with broad substrate specificity. It is a member of the subtilase family (1Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar) and is widely distributed in various organisms, including bacteria and archaea. These subtilisins are synthesized in a precursor form, in which a signal peptide and a propeptide are attached to the N terminus of the mature domain (1Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar, 2Pulido M. Saito K. Tanaka S. Koga Y. Morikawa M. Takano K. Kanaya S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which subtilisins are folded and matured has been most extensively studied for bacterial subtilisins, such as subtilisin E, subtilisin BPN′, and subtilisin Carlsberg. According to these studies, subtilisins are first secreted into an external medium in a pro form (prosubtilisin) with the assistance of signal peptide, and activated upon autoprocessing and degradation of propeptide (3Shinde U.P. Inouye M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 379: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Degradation of propeptide is necessary for the mature domain to function as an active enzyme, because the propeptide continues to bind tightly to the mature domain after autoprocessing and thereby inhibits its activity (4Li Y. Hu Z. Jordan F. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25127-25132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 5Huang H.W. Chen W.C. Wu C.Y. Yu H.C. Lin W.Y. Chen S.T. Wang K.T.

It has been proposed that propeptides of subtilisins function not only as inhibitors of their cognate mature domains but also as intramolecular chaperones that facilitate folding of the mature domains after secretion (7Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M.

The mature domains alone are not an active form but an inactive form with a molten globule-like structure in the absence of propeptides (7Eder J. Rheinnecker M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol.

Dependence on the propeptide for maturation of its cognate mature domain has been reported not only for other members of the subtilase family (11Baier K. Nicklisch S. Maldener I. Lockau W. Eur. J.

Comparison of these structures indicates that the folding process of the mature domain is almost fully completed prior to degradation of the propeptide. These structures also indicate that bacterial subtilisins have two Ca2+ binding sites, site 1 (site A) and site 2 (site B), both of which are located far from the active site. Sites 1 and 2 have high and low binding affinity, respectively. The enzyme is greatly destabilized with respect to both thermal denaturation and autodegradation upon removal of Ca2+ from site 1 (24Voordouw G. Milo C. Roche R.S.

J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Deletion of the loop forming site 1 of subtilisin BPN′, followed by directed evolution and selection for increased stability, results in a Ca2+-independent subtilisin mutant with native-like activity (25Bryan P. Alexander P. Strausberg S. Schwarz F. Lan W. Gilliland G. Gallagher D.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 28Gallagher T. Bryan P. Gilliland G.L.

However, the number and location of the Ca2+ binding sites vary greatly for other members of the subtilase family. For example, thermitase has three Ca2+ binding sites (30Gros P. Betzel C. Dauter Z.

Biol. 2003; 332: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which are located far from the active site but do not necessarily correlate to site 1 or site 2 of bacterial subtilisins. In addition, various subtilases, such as sphericase (33Almog O. Gonzalez A. Klein D. Greenblatt M.H. Braun S. Shoham G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), cell envelope protease (34Exterkate F.A. Alting A.C. Appl. Environ.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17448-17453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have been reported to exhibit Ca2+-dependent activity. These results suggest that the role of the Ca2+ ions varies for different subtilases.Tk-subtilisin 2The abbreviations used are: Tk-subtilisin, subtilisin from T. kodakaraensis; pro-Tk-subtilisin, Tk-subtilisin in a pro-form (Gly1–Gly398); Tk-propeptide, propeptide of Tk-subtilisin (Gly1–Leu69); mat-Tk-subtilisin, Tk-subtilisin in a mature form (Gly70–Gly398); mat-Tk-subtilisin*, a Ca2+-bound active form of mat-Tk-subtilisin; pro-S324A (S324C), pro-Tk-subtilisin with the Ser324 → Ala (Ser324 → Cys) mutation; mat-S324A(S324C), mat-Tk-subtilisin with the Ser324 → Ala (Ser324 → Cys) mutation; mat-S324C*, mat-Tk-subtilisin* with the Ser324 → Cys mutation; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; DTT, dithiothreitol; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: Tk-subtilisin, subtilisin from T. kodakaraensis; pro-Tk-subtilisin, Tk-subtilisin in a pro-form (Gly1–Gly398); Tk-propeptide, propeptide of Tk-subtilisin (Gly1–Leu69); mat-Tk-subtilisin, Tk-subtilisin in a mature form (Gly70–Gly398); mat-Tk-subtilisin*, a Ca2+-bound active form of mat-Tk-subtilisin; pro-S324A (S324C), pro-Tk-subtilisin with the Ser324 → Ala (Ser324 → Cys) mutation; mat-S324A(S324C), mat-Tk-subtilisin with the Ser324 → Ala (Ser324 → Cys) mutation; mat-S324C*, mat-Tk-subtilisin* with the Ser324 → Cys mutation; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; DTT, dithiothreitol; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid. from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis consists of signal peptide (Met-24–Ala-1), propeptide (Gly1–Leu69), and mature domain (Gly70–Gly398) (2Pulido M. Saito K. Tanaka S. Koga Y. Morikawa M. Takano K. Kanaya S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mature domain of Tk-subtilisin contains three major insertion sequences as compared with those of bacterial subtilisins. Other than that, the sequence is similar to those of bacterial subtilisins both in size and amino acid sequence (amino acid sequence identities of 45–46%). Like bacterial subtilisins, Tk-subtilisin is matured from pro-Tk-subtilisin upon autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide. In this process, the propeptide is autoprocessed at first to produce an inactive complex between the propeptide and mature domain. Then the propeptide, which is a potent inhibitor and, at the same time, a good substrate of the mature domain, is degraded by the mature domain to produce active enzyme. However, unlike bacterial subtilisins, Tk-subtilisin requires Ca2+ for activity and is therefore not matured at all even at high temperatures in the absence of Ca2+. In addition, the propeptide of pro-Tk-subtilisin is not required for folding of the mature domain, although it is involved in folding of the mature domain in an auxiliary manner. These results suggest that the maturation process of Tk-subtilisin is different from that proposed for bacterial subtilisins. To understand this unique maturation process, it is necessary to determine the crystal structure of pro-Tk-subtilisin in a Ca2+-bound form. However, pro-Tk-subtilisin is not fully stable in the presence of Ca2+ even at 4 °C, especially when its concentration is high. In this condition, pro-Tk-subtilisin is gradually converted to an active mature form, which is finally self-degraded.We have recently succeeded in crystallizing the active site mutant of pro-Tk-subtilisin, pro-S324A, in a Ca2+-bound form and performed preliminary x-ray diffraction studies (36Tanaka S. Saito K. Chon H. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this report, we determined the crystal structure of this protein, which represents the unautoprocessed precursor structure of subtilisin, at 2.3 Aå resolution. We also showed that the conformation of pro-S324A is considerably changed from a molten globule-like structure to a native one upon Ca2+ binding. Furthermore, we constructed another active site mutant pro-S324C and characterized it biochemically. Based on these results, we discuss a unique maturation process of Tk-subtilisin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—The gene encoding pro-S324C was amplified by PCR using overlap extension method (37Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). The mutagenic primers were designed such that the codon for Ser324 (AGC) is changed to TGC for Cys. The pET25b derivative for overproduction of pro-S324A (36Tanaka S. Saito K. Chon H. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The pET25b derivatives for overproduction of pro-S324C and mat-S324A were constructed as previously described for pro-Tk-subtilisin and mat-Tk-subtilisin, respectively (2Pulido M. Saito K. Tanaka S.

All DNA oligomers for PCR were synthesized by Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan). PCR was performed in 25 cycles using a thermal cycler (Gene Amp PCR System 2400; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The DNA sequences of the genes encoding pro-S324C and mat-S324A were confirmed by ABI Prism 310 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Overproduction and Purification of the Mutant Proteins— Overproduction of pro-S324A, pro-S324C, and mat-S324A in Escherichia coli BL21-codonPlus(DE3) (Stratagene) was carried out as described previously for pro-Tk-subtilisin (38Kannan Y.

The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), disrupted by sonication on ice, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 8 m urea and 5 mm EDTA and applied to a HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer. The protein was eluted from the column at NaCl concentration of ∼0.1 m for pro-S324A and pro-S324C and ∼0.2 m for mat-S324A by linearly increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 to 0.3 m. The fractions containing the protein were collected and refolded as described below. For refolding of pro-S324A, pro-S324C, and mat-S324A in a Ca2+-free form, these proteins (25 μm) were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) at 4 °C. For refolding of pro-S324A and pro-S324C in a Ca2+-bound form, these proteins (25 μm) were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm DTT at 4 °C for 5 days, incubated at 80 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200HR column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 50 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the protein were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2.Pro-Tk-subtilisin, mat-Tk-subtilisin, and Tk-propeptide were overproduced and purified as described previously (2Pulido M. Saito K. Tanaka S. Koga Y. Morikawa M. Takano K. Kanaya S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). mat-Tk-subtilisin*, which represents a Ca2+-bound active form of mat-Tk-subtilisin, was prepared by incubating pro-Tk-subtilisin at 80 °C for 90 min in the presence of Ca2+ as described previously (2Pulido M. Saito K. Tanaka S. Koga Y. Morikawa M. Takano K. Kanaya S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2006; 72: 4154-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and used without further purification.The protein concentration was determined from UV absorption using a cell with an optical path length of 1 cm and A280 value for 0.1% (1 mg/ml) solution of 1.25 for pro-Tk-subtilisin, pro-S324A, and pro-S324C; 1.47 for mat-Tk-subtilisin and mat-S324A; and 0.21 for Tk-propeptide. These values were calculated by using absorption coefficients of 1,526 m-1 cm-1 for tyrosine and 5,225 m-1 cm-1 for tryptophan at 280 nm (39Goodwin T.W. Morton R.A. Biochem. J. 1946; 40: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). For N-terminal amino acid sequencing, the protein visualized with CBB staining was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (blotting). The-N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined using a Procise 491 automated protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Enzymatic Activity—The enzymatic activity was determined by using N-succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) as a substrate at 80 °C. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contains 50 mm CAPS-NaOH (pH 9.5), 5 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm N-succinyl-AAPF-p-nitroanilide. The amount of p-nitroaniline released from the substrate was determined from the absorption at 410 nm with an absorption coefficient of 8,900 m-1 cm-1 by automatic UV spectrophotometer (Beckman model DU640). One unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of the enzyme that produced 1 μmol of p-nitroaniline/min. The specific activity was defined as the enzymatic activity/mg of protein.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The far-UV (200–260 nm) and near-UV (250–320 nm) CD spectra of the protein were measured by a J-725 automatic spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co.) at 20 °C. The buffer was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 10 mm CaCl2 for protein in a Ca2+-bound form and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) for protein in a Ca2+-free form. The protein concentration and optical path length were 0.15 mg/ml and 2 mm for far-UV CD spectra and 1.0 mg/ml and 1 cm for near-UV CD spectra, respectively. The mean residue ellipticity, [θ], which has the unit of degrees cm2 dmol-1, was calculated by using an average amino acid molecular weight of 110.1-Anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic Acid (ANS) Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Binding of ANS (Sigma) to the protein was analyzed by measuring the fluorescence of ANS at 20 °C. The protein (1 μm) and ANS (50 μm) were dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) either in the presence or absence of 10 mm CaCl2. The protein was incubated at 20 °C for 4 h prior to the measurement of ANS fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was 380 nm, and the emission was monitored from 400 to 600 nm. The spectrum obtained in the absence of the protein was used as blank.Analysis of Folding Efficiency—mat-Tk-subtilisin or mat-S324A (30 μm) was first unfolded by incubating it for 1 h at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 6 m guanidine HCl. The protein was refolded by 100-fold dilution with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm DTT, either in the presence or absence of 10 mm CaCl2 and either in the presence or absence of 0.3 μm Tk-propeptide at 4 °C. Then refolded mat-Tk-subtilisin was incubated at 80 °C for 30 min, and refolded mat-S324A was digested with chymotrypsin at 30 °C for 1 h at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w) after incubation at 4 °C for 1 day. Finally, 112 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added to 1 ml of the reaction mixture to precipitate the proteins. The resultant precipitates were washed with 70% acetone and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE.Crystallization of Pro-S324A in Ca2+-bound Form—Pro-S324A purified in a Ca2+-bound form was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an ultrafiltration system Centricon (Millipore Corp.), and crystallized using 4 m sodium formate as described previously (36Tanaka S. Saito K. Chon H. Matsumura H. Koga Y. Takano K. Kanaya S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 902-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction studies on the resultant crystals indicated that these belonged to the space group I222 (unit cell parameters a = 92.69, b = 121.78, c = 77.53 Aå) and contained single protein molecules per asymmetric unit.X-ray Diffraction Data Collection and Structure Determination—x-ray diffraction data were collected at a wavelength of 1.0 Aå with the beam line BL41XU station at SPring-8, Japan. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL2000 program suite (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The crystal structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using MOLREP (42Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 program suite. The 2.1 Aå structure of subtilisin-propeptide complex (Protein Data Bank entry 1SCJ) was used as a starting model. Model building and refinement of the structure were completed using the programs O (43Jones T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgarrd M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

After molecular replacement, six Ca2+ ions coordinated by six or seven ligands were observed, refining with full occupancy in the electron density (2Fo - Fc). Progress in the structure refinement was evaluated at each stage by the free R factor and by inspection of stereochemical parameters calculated by the program PROCHECK (45Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot produced by PROCHECK showed that almost all residues in the structure were in the favored region. The statistics for data collection and refinement are presented in Table 1.

The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure consists of one protein molecule containing 395 of 398 residues, with three residues at the N terminus missing, 270 water molecules, and six calcium ions. This structure is composed of the propeptide domain (Asn4–Leu69) and mature domain (Gly70–Gly398). The overall structure of pro-S324A in a Ca2+-bound form is shown in Fig. 1A.The propeptide domain folds into a compact structure with a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β1p–β4p) and two α-helices (α1p and α2p). This β-sheet packs tightly to the two nearly parallel α-helices (α6m and α7m) located at the surface of the mature domain. Glu61 and Asp63 of the propeptide domain also bind to the N termini of these two α-helices to form helix caps. In addition, the linker peptide between the propeptide and mature domain runs through the active site cleft in a substrate/product-like manner, with the Leu69-Gly70 peptide bond (cleavage site) docked close to Ala324, which is substituted for the catalytic serine residue (Fig. 2A). Leu69 and Gly70 occupy subsites S1 and S1′ of the mature domain, respectively. Leu69 oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with Ala324 nitrogen. The β5p-strand of the propeptide domain interacts with β4m-strand of the mature domain to form an antiparallel β-sheet in the vicinity of the active site. A similar structure has been reported for the linker peptide of prokumamolisin, which is a member of a different subtilase family (46Comellas-Bigler M. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Oda K. Bode W. Structure. 2004; 12: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2A stereo view of electron density around the active site (A) and Ca-1 site (B) of pro-S324A. In A, the 2Fo - Fc map contoured at the 1.5σ level is shown. In B, the 2Fo - Fc maps contoured at the 2.0σ and 5.0σ levels are shown in blue and magenta, respectively. The active site residues, the nitrogen and oxygen atoms, and the Ca2+ ions are indicated as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The mature domain consists of a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet (β1m–β3m and β5m–β8m), β4m-strand, an anti-parallel β-sheet (β9m and β10m), and 10 α-helices (α1m–α10m). Of them, the seven-stranded parallel β-sheet and two α-helices (α5m and α8m) form a core structure. As in all members of the subtilase family, three active site residues, Asp115, His153, and Ser324, form a catalytic triad in Tk-subtilisin. In the present structure, Ser324 is replaced by Ala. Two hydrogen bonds are formed between His153 Nδ1 and Asp115 Oδ1 and between His153 Nδ1 and Asp115 Oδ2. These two hydrogen bonds are also observed in the subtilisin E-propeptide complex structure (22Jain S.C. Shinde U.P. Li Y. Inouy"
https://openalex.org/W1988085647,"We found that anthraquinone diffuses along a straight line across a flat, highly symmetric Cu111 surface. It can also reversibly attach one or two CO2 molecules as ""cargo"" and act as a ""molecule carrier,"" thereby transforming the diffusive behavior of the CO2 molecules from isotropic to linear. Density functional theory calculations indicated a substrate-mediated attraction of approximately 0.12 electron volt (eV). Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed individual steps of the molecular complex on its diffusion pathway, with increases of approximately 0.03 and approximately 0.02 eV in the diffusion barrier upon attachment of the first and second CO2 molecule, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2003404408,"Subunit a is thought to play a key role in H+ transport-driven rotation of the subunit c ring in Escherichia coli F1F0 ATP synthase. In the membrane-traversing F0 sector of the enzyme, H+ binding and release occurs at Asp-61 in the middle of the second transmembrane helix (TMH) of subunit c. Protons are thought to reach Asp-61 via aqueous channels formed at least in part by one or more of the five TMHs of subunit a. Aqueous access to surfaces of TMHs 2, 4, and 5 was previously suggested based upon the chemical reactivity of cysteine residues substituted into these helices. Here we have substituted Cys into TMH1 and TMH3 and extended the substitutions in TMH5 to the cytoplasmic surface. One region of TMH3 proved to be moderately Ag+-sensitive and may connect with the Ag+-sensitive region found previously on the periplasmic side of TMH2. A single Cys substitution in TMH1 proved to be both N-ethylmaleimide (NEM)-sensitive and Ag+-sensitive and suggests a possible packing interaction of TMH1 with TMH2 and TMH3. New Ag+- and NEM-sensitive residues were found at the cytoplasmic end of TMH5 and suggest a possible connection of this region to the NEM- and Ag+-sensitive region of TMH4 described previously. From the now complete pattern of TMH residue reactivity, we conclude that aqueous access from the periplasmic side of F0 to cAsp-61 at the center of the membrane is likely to be mediated by residues of TMHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 at the center of a four-helix bundle. Further, aqueous access between cAsp-61 and the cytoplasmic surface is likely to be mediated by residues in TMH4 and TMH5 at the exterior of the four-helix bundle that are in contact with the c-ring.

In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector at the surface of the membrane, synthesis being coupled to H+ transport through the transmembrane F0 sector. Homologous enzymes are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many bacteria (4Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1988; 68: 177-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar).

A high resolution x-ray structure of the I. tartaricus c11-ring has revealed the sodium-binding site at the periphery of the ring with chelating groups to the Na+ extending from two interacting subunits (7Meier T. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Dimroth P. Science. 2005; 308: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The essential I. tartaricus Glu-65 in the Na+ chelating site corresponds to E. coli Asp-61. In the H+-transporting E. coli enzyme, Asp-61 at the center of the second TMH is thought to undergo protonation and deprotonation as each subunit of the c ring moves past a stationary subunit a. In the complete membranous enzyme, the rotation of subunit c is proposed to be driven by H+ transport at the subunit a/c interface, and this rotation then drives rotation of subunit γ within the α3β3 hexamer of F1 to cause conformational changes in the catalytic sites leading to synthesis and release of ATP (1Yoshida M.

The differential reactivity of cysteines introduced by site-directed mutagenesis has been used as a means of probing aqueous-accessible regions of several membrane proteins.

Previously, we probed Cys residues introduced into TMHs 2, 4, and 5 for aqueous accessibility based upon their reactivity with NEM and Ag+ (11Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One region consists of Ag+- and NEM-sensitive residues on one side of TMH4 extending from Asn-214 and Arg-210 near the center of the membrane to the cytoplasmic surface. A second set of Ag+-sensitive but NEM-inaccessible residues maps to the opposite face and periplasmic side of TMH4 and from the center of the membrane to the periplasmic surfaces of TMH2 and TMH5. The Ag+-sensitive residues in TMHs 2, 4, and 5 cluster at the interior of the four-helix bundle predicted by cross-linking (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and could interact to form a continuous aqueous pathway extending from the periplasmic surface to the center of the membrane. In the experiments reported here, we have focused on TMH1, TMH3, and the cytoplasmic end of TMH5. Construction of Cys-substituted Mutants—The cysteine substitutions generated here were transferred into plasmid pCMA113 (11Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which contains a hexahistidine tag on the C terminus of subunit a (14Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H.

Ketchum C.J. Nakamoto R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cys substitutions were introduced by a two-step PCR method using a synthetic oligonucleotide, which contained the codon change, and two wild type primers (31Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 203-215PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products were transferred into pCMA113 directly using unique HindIII (870) or PflMI (1136) and BsrGI (1913) sites (see Ref. 32Gay N.J. Walker J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar for nucleotide numbering). TMH3 mutations were transferred into pVF196 (14Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) using unique PflMI (1136) and PshAI (1805) sites and then transferred to pCMA113 using HindIII and BsrGI sites as described above. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing the cloned fragment through the ligation junctions. All experiments were performed with the mutant whole operon plasmid derivative of pCMA113 in the unc operon deletion host strain JWP292 (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All plasmid transformant strains were tested for growth on succinate and glucose as described (11Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation—Plasmid transformants of strain JWP292 were grown in M63 minimal medium containing 0.6% glucose, 2 mg/liter thiamine, 0.2 mm uracil, 1 mm l-arginine, 0.02 mm dihydroxybenzoic acid, and 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin, supplemented with 10% LB medium, and harvested in the late exponential phase of growth (5Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in TMG-acetate buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml DNase I and disrupted by passage through a French press at 1.38 × 108 nt/m2, and membranes were prepared as described (33Mosher M.E. White L.K. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4807-4814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final membrane preparation was suspended in TMG-acetate buffer and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a modified Lowry assay (34Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-driven Quenching of ACMA Fluorescence—Membranes were suspended in 3.2 ml of HMK buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, 1 mm Mg(NO3)2, and 10 mm KNO3,pH 7.5). ACMA was added to 0.3 μg/ml final concentration, and 30 μl of 0.1 m ATP, pH 7.0, was added to initiate quenching of fluorescence. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 8 μl of 288 μm nigericin (0.5 μg/ml final concentration). The level of fluorescence obtained after the addition of nigericin was normalized to 100% in calculating the percentage of quenching due to ATP-driven proton pumping. For AgNO3 treatment, 160 μlofmembranes at 10 mg/ml was suspended in HMK buffer containing 40 μm AgNO3 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before carrying out the quenching assay. For NEM treatment, membranes at 10 mg/ml in TMG-acetate buffer were treated with 5 mm NEM for 15 min at room temperature and then diluted into HMK-nitrate buffer before carrying out the same quenching assay. Properties of Cys Substitutions in TMH 1, 3, and 5 of Subunit a—In this study, Cys substitutions in TMH1, TMH3, and TMH5 and adjacent loop regions were generated in a His-tagged version of subunit a. The substitutions were expressed from a plasmid encoding subunits of F1 and F0 in which all endogenous Cys were substituted by Ala or Ser (11Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These plasmids were transformed into strain JWP292, which carries a chromosomal deletion of the entire unc (atp) operon. The growth of these strains on minimal medium was compared using glucose or succinate as carbon sources (Table 1). The Cys substitutions reported here had minimal effects on growth with either carbon source. Additionally, ATP-driven quenching of ACMA fluorescence was performed on inside-out membrane vesicles of the substituted strains to evaluate ATPase-coupled H+ pumping function (Table 1). The quenching response for most mutants was close to that observed with the control, Cys-free wild type membranes, which typically showed quenching responses of 76 ± 6%. Of the 72 Cys-substituted mutants tested, the D44C mutant showed the most severely reduced quenching response at 45%, with seven other mutants (at residues 54, 56, 58, 135, 136, 146, and 155) showing more modest reductions in quenching to the range of 50–60%.TABLE 1Functional properties of subunit a substitutions reported in this studyLocation and mutationGrowth on glucoseaGrowth yield in liquid minimal medium containing 0.04% glucose, expressed as a percentage of growth relative to the cysteine-less control strain.

Examples for the five moderately Ag+-sensitive mutants are shown in Fig. 1. In each of the five mutants, Ag+ reduced the quenching response by greater than 50%. NEM had negligible inhibitory effects on the quenching response for three of the substitutions shown but significantly reduced the quenching response for the D44C and D146C mutants (Fig. 1). As discussed in greater detail below, the NEM sensitivities of residues D44C and D146C are unusual in that only a few other transmembrane Cys in subunit a react with NEM. The complete surveys of the Ag+ sensitivity and NEM sensitivity of residues in TMH1 and TMH3, including periplasmic loop 2–3 and portions of loop 3–4, are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. The activity of all transmembrane Cys substitutions in TMH1 was relatively insensitive to Ag+ or NEM treatment with the dramatic exception of D44C (Fig. 2). The R140C, S144C, and D146C substitutions within the predicted membrane spanning sequence of TMH3 (residues 138–159) were inhibited by Ag+ with S144C showing the greatest sensitivity (>70% inhibition) (Fig. 3). As mentioned previously, D146C was also sensitive to inhibition by NEM. Two Cys substitutions at positions 130 and 136, which are predicted to reside in the periplasmic loop between TMHs 2 and 3, were also inhibited by ≥50% upon Ag+ treatment. Residues 161 and 162 at the beginning of the 3–4 cytoplasmic loop also showed modest sensitivity to Ag+ treatment, i.e. 40–50% inhibition.FIGURE 2NEM and Ag+ sensitivity of Cys substitutions in aTMH1.

Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Ag+-sensitive residues in TMH4 extended to the cytoplasmic surface but had not completed a survey of residues near the cytoplasmic surface in TMH5. The Ag+ and NEM sensitivities of 8 such residues are shown in Fig. 4. Cys substitutions at positions 262 and 263 resulted in significant sensitivity to Ag+ inhibition, activity being inhibited by 72 and 89%, respectively. However, these two substitutions show striking differences in NEM sensitivity with V262C showing 75% inhibition versus a more modest 24% inhibition for Y263C. The L264C substitution was also moderately sensitive to inhibition by Ag+, whereas other residues were resistant to inhibition by Ag+ or NEM. Prior to this study, we found that Ag+-sensitive Cys residues in TMHs 2, 4, and 5 localized to distinct helical surfaces that we concluded were likely to be aqueous-accessible (11Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6066-6074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 12Angevine C.M. Herold K.A. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ionic radius of Ag+ is close to that of Na+ or H3O+ (28Lu Q. Miller C. Science. 1995; 268: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), and the ionized Cys thiolate that is thought to be the reactive species would be formed preferentially in an aqueous environment. It is unclear exactly why Ag+ modification of these thiolates results in inhibition of ATP-driven H+ translocation, but minimally, the Ag+ sensitivity indicates that these residues are likely to be aqueous-accessible. The purpose of this study was to test whether these putative aqueous access pathways extended to residues lining TMH1 and TMH3 and to the cytoplasmic end of TMH5. The Cys residues to which the Ag+ and NEM sensitivity have now been mapped are shown in a topological model of subunit a in Fig. 5. We will discuss the results within the context of a model for interaction of these helices, the model being based upon zero-length cross-linking between Cys residues introduced into adjacent TMHs (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cross-sectional packing of TMHs 2, 3, 4, and 5 predicted by this model is shown in Fig. 6. 3The 8 cross-linkable Cys-Cys pairs used to construct the model are: 120/144 (TMHs 2–3), 119/218 and120/218 (TMHs 2–4), 120/245 and 120/246 (TMHs 2–5), 148/219 (TMHs 3–4), 148/245 (TMHs 3–5), and 218/248 (TMHs 4–5). The Cys-Cys cross-links were also used to estimate the relative depth of placement of adjacent TMHs in the lipid bilayer, as indicated in Fig. 5, by minimizing vertical distances between cross-linkable Cys pairs. The depth of placement of TMH4 in subunit a was based upon its cross-linking to TMH2 of subunit c (17Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and the positioning of the I. tartaricus c-ring in a lipid bilayer was determined by cryo-electron crystallography (35Vonck J. von Nidda T.K. Meier T. Matthey U. Mills D.J. Kühlbrandt W. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The cross-linkable Cys pairs form a near horizontal band on the periplasmic side of TMHs 2–5, extending from residues 119 and 120 in TMH2 to residues 245, 246, and 248 in TMH5 (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cross-linking results indicate that these helices could cross each other and pack as a four-helix bundle in this region.FIGURE 6Cross-sectional view of Ag+-sensitive residues in the five TMHs of subunit a. The relative position of Ag+-sensitive residues in TMHs 2–5 is depicted by cross-sectional views of α-helical wheels. The juxtaposition of TMHs 2–5 to each other is based upon the cross-linking experiments described in Schwem and Fillingame (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The most Ag+-sensitive residues are shown in red (>90% inhibition) and orange (71–90% inhibition). The position of the moderately Ag+-sensitive residues 140 and 146 in TMH3 are shown in brown (51–70% inhibition). The other residues shown in black depict the positions of Cys that form cross-links between different TMHs. The placement of TMH1 between TMHs 2 and 3 is based upon the possible connectivity of Ag+-sensitive residues at the interface of these helices. The position of the aArg-210 side chain is also indicated. The green shaded area represents the helical face of TMH4 that cross-links to TMH2 of subunit c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A striking feature of the proposed four-helix bundle is the clustering of Ag+-sensitive residues at its center (Fig. 6); these residues could interact to form an aqueous access pathway from the periplasm. The clustered residues include the very Ag+-sensitive residues 119 and 120 from TMH2, 215 from TMH4, and 245 and 252 from TMH5. The more moderately sensitive residues 140 and 144 in TMH3 might also line this access pathway. A close proximity of residues 140 and 144 in TMH3 and the Ag+-sensitive face of TMH2 is supported by the observed cross-linking of Cys residues introduced at positions 120 and 144. The silver sensitivity of residues 130 and 136 in the periplasmic loop between these helices could indicate a possible packing interaction of the loop with the periplasmic ends of these helices. Residue 146, which is moderately sensitive to both NEM and Ag+, would lie at the opposite, peripheral face of TMH3 (Fig. 6), and its presence at that position is not easily reconciled with the clustering of other Ag+-sensitive residues at the center of the four-helix bundle. 4Cys residues at positions 142, 144, and 146 were labeled by biotin-maleimide from the periplasmic surface and led Zhang and Vik (37Zhang D. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to conclude that this region extended into the periplasmic loop. Such a placement, outside of the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, conflicts with the cross-linking results (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but the biotin-maleimide reactivity suggests that this transmembrane region may have unusual aqueous accessibility. Residue 44 in TMH1 could also contribute to the aqueous access pathway from the periplasm. The D44C replacement is moderately sensitive to both Ag+ and NEM. The D44C substitution leads to a fairly profound reduction in ATP-driven ACMA quenching and may suggest an important functional role for this residue. 5Of the 162 Cys substitutions tested to date, only 12 show reductions in the ATP-driven quenching of similar or greater magnitude with the R210C, G213C, and H245C, showing quenching responses in the range of 0–10%, and the D44C, D119C, L207C, L209C, Y216C G218C, E219C, L220C, and Q252C substitutions, showing quenching responses in the range of 25–45% (see supplemental Table 2 online). The Asp-44 residue may play an important, albeit not totally essential, role in the passage of protons through F0 during ATPase/synthase-coupled H+ transport. Howitt et al. (36Howitt S.M. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 936: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have previously reported that the D44N substitution results in blockage of passive F0-mediated H+ translocation, albeit without significantly affecting in vivo activity and growth on glucose or succinate. D44C membranes, which had been stripped of F1, remained H+ impermeable and are also blocked in passive F0-mediated H+ translocation (experiments not shown). We suggest that TMH1 may pack between TMH2 and TMH3, as indicated in Fig. 6, and bring the Asp-44 residue close to the cluster of other Ag+-sensitive residues in TMH2 (i.e. Met-115, Asp-119, Pro-122, and Asp-126), and Ser-144 in TMH3. In this proximity, the Asp-44 residue could potentially form a salt bridge with Arg-140 in TMH2. Arg-140 could also potentially form a salt bridge with Asp-119 in TMH2. These possible proximities are now being tested by cross-linking and additional mutational analysis. We also report two new Ag+-sensitive Cys substitutions at the cytoplasmic boundary of TMH5 (Fig. 5). The Y263C substitution is one of the most Ag+-sensitive residues seen in the protein, showing 89% inhibition upon Ag+ treatment. 6The Y263C cysteine was labeled by biotin-maleimide from the cytoplasmic surface (16Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and some substitutions at this position (e.g. Lys, Glu, Gly) were shown to significantly disrupt proton translocation through F0 (38Vik S.B.

V262C is more moderately sensitive to Ag+ but also very sensitive to NEM, showing >75% inhibition upon treatment with NEM. At the cytoplasmic side of TMH4, the principle residues implicated in H+ transport include the very Ag+-sensitive residues 202, 203, and 206. Residue 206 is also very sensitive to NEM. A single NEM-accessible pocket could extend from residues 206 in TMH4 and 262 in TMH5 and possibly connect with the NEM-sensitive N214C residue at the center of the membrane. The critical Arg-210 residue would then locate to the center of this pocket. This interface is presumed to pack at the peripheral surface of the c-ring and participate with cAsp-61 in proton-translocation and c-ring rotation. The Ag+ sensitivity of residues 262 and 263 may indicate a connectivity of the aqueous-accessible space at the cytoplasmic surface of TMH5. The very Ag+-sensitive Y263C substitution would face the interior of the four-helix bundle with the NEM-sensitive V262C facing the periphery Fig. 6). In summary, from the now complete survey of the Ag+ and NEM reactivity of Cys-substituted TMHs in subunit a,we hypothesize that there are two aqueous half-channels in subunit a extending from the center of the lipid bilayer to the cytoplasmic or periplasmic surfaces. When the chemical modification data are correlated with the cross-linking data (23Schwem B.E. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the Ag+-sensitive residues that extend to the periplasmic surface cluster at the center of the proposed four-helix bundle of TMHs 2–4 and may bridge to the interface of TMH1 as it packs between TMH2 and TMH3. The cytoplasmic half-channel begins in the region of Asn-214 and Arg-210 at the center of the membrane and extends along the outer face of TMH4 to Ser-202 at the surface of the lipid bilayer. Cys residues introduced into this region are both NEM- and Ag+-sensitive, and this aqueous pocket may extend to the NEM-sensitive V262C substitution at the peripheral face of TMH5. The residues at the peripheral faces of TMHs 4 and 5 are presumed to interact with the c-ring during the protonation and deprotonation of Asp-61 of subunit c. The key question raised by this model relates to the mechanism of gating of the two half-channels. The protonated cAsp-61 is hypothesized to release its proton to the cytoplasmic half-channel due to interaction with aArg-210 with a consequent lowering of its pKa (13Fillingame R. Angevine C. Dmitriev O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Reprotonation from the periplasm would seem to require a change in the positioning of these residues to break the salt bridge and raise the pKa to facilitate protonation. If protons gain access to this site via a periplasmic pathway at the center of the four-helix bundle, how are the H+ transferred to cAsp-61 on the surface of the c-ring? It seems possible that the protons could collect at the junction defined by the very Ag+-sensitive Q252C and M215C substitutions and that a swiveling of these helices would enable movement of H+ to the periphery. Such swiveling could also simultaneously move the aArg-210 away from cAsp-61 to facilitate its reprotonation. Download .pdf (.12 MB) Help with pdf files"

We report in this study the identification of surface markers by performing comparative proteomics of established human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) latent cell models and parental cell lines. To this end we isolated integral membrane proteins using a biotin-directed affinity purification method. Isolated proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) after in gel digestion. Seventeen different proteins were found to vary on the surface of T-cells due to HIV-1 infection. Of these proteins, 47% were integral membrane proteins, and 18% were membrane-associated. Through the use of complementary techniques such as Western blotting and fluorescent staining, we confirmed the differential expression of some of the proteins identified by MALDI-TOF including Bruton's tyrosine kinase and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis. Finally, using phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and flavopiridol to inhibit Bruton's tyrosine kinase localization at the membrane and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression, respectively, we showed that HIV-1 latently infected cells are more sensitive to these drugs than uninfected cells. This suggests that HIV-1 latently infected cells may be targeted with drugs that alter several pathways that are essential for the establishment and maintenance of latency.

Biological membranes surround and compartmentalize cells. They provide a physical boundary between the cell and its environment and play an important role in cellular homoeostasis and metabolic energy transduction. According to the Singer-Nicolson “fluid-mosaic model” (1Singer S.J. Nicolson G.L. Science. 1972; 175: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (6100) Google Scholar), plasma membranes are organized into lipid bilayers containing proteins that can diffuse rapidly throughout the two-dimensional surface of the membrane. Membrane proteins typically make up around a third of the proteome of a cell and associate with the membrane in different ways. Integral membrane proteins are contained within the bilayer through one or more transmembrane regions. They can also be associated with lipid anchors such as fatty acids and can cover large regions of a membrane with protein surfaces. Alternatively, proteins can be associated with the membrane through non-covalent interactions with integral membrane proteins or other membrane-associated proteins. The fluidity differences and the organization of protein and lipids within the plasma membrane depend upon the cholesterol content in the bilayer (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). The current evidence supports a novel concept of specific microdomains existing in the plasma membrane in vivo in regions rich in cholesterol (2Brown D.A. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 3Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). These specific microdomains, termed “lipid rafts,” are composed of tightly packed sphingolipids, gangliosides, and cholesterol (4Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are generally small, ranging from 25 to 700 nm depending on the activation state of the cell (5Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In addition to their small size, lipid rafts are mobile, enabling them to operate as floating devices that can transport specific proteins involved in many cellular processes (6Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 7Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).

The virus establishes a persistent infection in CD4+ T lymphocytes and, to a lesser extent, macrophages, while creating a persistent reservoir mainly consisting of latently infected resting memory CD4+ T cells (8Chun T.W. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10958-10961Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Current therapies directed against viral proteins, highly active anti-retroviral therapy, have been problematic because of long-term toxicity, inhibitor resistance, and the inability to target persistent reservoirs. Thus, there is a need for new approaches to selectively target latent reservoirs and to discover unique protein targets for the design of therapeutic drugs. Proteomics is a promising approach for the study of viruses. It allows a better understanding of pathogenesis and the development of new biomarkers for diagnosis and early detection of disease and accelerates drug development. However, most viral proteomics research has focused on determining the virion proteome or on identifying unique protein signatures from extracts of HIV-infected cells. Fuchigami et al. (10Fuchigami T. Misumi S. Takamune N. Takahashi I. Takama M. Shoji S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1107-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) identified 25 proteins within HIV-1 (LAV-1) virions by separating the proteins from purified HIV-1 particles by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identifying them by MALDI-TOF (9Pocernich C.B. Boyd-Kimball D. Poon H.F. Thongboonkerd V. Lynn B.C. Klein J.B. Calebrese V. Nath A. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 133: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In another study Carlson et al. (11Carlson K.A. Ciborowski P. Schellpeper C.N. Biskup T.M. Shen R.F. Luo X. Destache C.J. Gendelman H.E. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 147: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) used a ProteinChip and surface enhancement laser desorption ionization to identify unique protein signatures in HIV-infected monocytes obtained from different donors. Although several thousand proteins were identified, they were all abundant cellular proteins (11Carlson K.A. Ciborowski P. Schellpeper C.N. Biskup T.M. Shen R.F. Luo X. Destache C.J. Gendelman H.E. J. Neuroimmunol. 2004; 147: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To reduce the complexity of this analysis, it is desirable to apply proteomics for the characterization of subcellular proteomes such as secreted proteins, surface proteins, and immunogenic proteins. Our objective in this study was to identify surface markers on HIV-1 latently infected cells by performing comparative proteomics on established cell models of HIV-1 latency and parental cell lines. ACH2 cells are HIV-1 latently infected lymphocytic CEM (12D7) cells with a single integrated wild type provirus (12Ross E.K. Buckler-White A.J. Rabson A.B. Englund G. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4350-4358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They express only basal levels of viral mRNAs and proteins and do not produce high titer infectious virus without stimulation (13Clark E. Santiago F. Deng L. Chong S. de La Fuente C. Wang L. Fu P. Stein D. Denny T. Lanka V. Mozafari F. Okamoto T. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5040-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We isolated integral membrane proteins by biotinylation and affinity purification as previously described (14Zhao Y. Zhang W. Kho Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), separated the isolated proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and determined their identity by MALDI-TOF. Comparison of uninfected and latently infected cells allowed the identification of 17 differentially expressed proteins, on the cell surface of which 47% were found to be integral membrane proteins and 18% were membrane-associated, whereas 35% were either cytoplasmic- or organelle-associated. Many of these proteins belong to the receptor signaling, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton pathways, and a few proteins were T-cell-specific including T cell receptor and junction adhesion molecule 3. Finally, we confirmed the differential expression in HIV latently infected cells of two proteins, BTK and XIAP, by immunoblotting and confocal microscopy and used specific inhibitors wortmannin, to inhibit BTK localization at the membrane, and flavopiridol, to inhibit XIAP protein expression. Furthermore, we showed that HIV-1 latently infected cells are more sensitive to these drugs than uninfected cells. Therefore, by comparing surface proteins of infected and uninfected cells, we have identified several pathways that are important for the maintenance of latency including cell survival and anti-apoptotic and cell adhesion/migration pathways. Targeting several of these pathways in infected cells may help define new therapies to eradicate latently infected cells that persist after highly active anti-retroviral therapy treatment. ACH2 (AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program, National Institutes of Health) is an HIV-1-infected latent T-cell clone derived from the parental CEM (A3.01) cells that were initially infected with the LAV strain of HIV-1. CEM (12D7) is an uninfected human T lymphoblastoid cell line, and A3.01 is a hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine (HAT)-sensitive derivative of CEM. ACH2, A3.01, and CEM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% l-glutamine (Quality Biological). HLM-1 cells (AIDS Research and Reference Reagents Program, NIH) are HeLa-T4+ cells containing one integrated copy of HIV-1 genome with a Tat-defective mutation at the first AUG of Tat gene. In the absence of stimulation, HLM-1 is completely negative for virus particle production, and viral transcripts are completely absent (15Berro R. Kehn K. de la Fuente C. Pumfery A. Adair R. Wade J. Colberg-Poley A.M. Hiscott J. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 3189-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HLM-1 and HeLa-T4+ were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Quality Biological) and G418 (200 μg/ml) for selection. PBMC were isolated from healthy donor blood according to standard procedures. In brief, 10 ml of blood was layered over 5 ml of Ficoll and spun at 1000 × g for 30 min with no braking. The white cell layer was removed and washed twice with PBS. Isolated PBMC were counted and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 20% fetal bovine serum and 10% Me2SO for storage in liquid nitrogen. PBMC were activated with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) in the presence of interleukin-2 (20 IU/μl) and infected with HIV-1 LAI strain at 1000 TC50. The BTK-GFP plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Smith (Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden) and previously described (16Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ACH2 and CEM (5 × 108 cells/isolation) were surface-biotinylated for 30 min at 4 °C using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce), as previously described (14Zhao Y. Zhang W. Kho Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Peirce M.J. Wait R. Begum S. Saklatvala J. Cope A.P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 56-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells were then centrifuged and washed twice with cold Dulbecco’s PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+ to remove excess biotin. Next, cells were homogenized in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, protease inhibitor mixture tablet, 1 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4) using a Dounce homogenizer (50 strokes). Lysates were centrifuged twice, first at 1000 × g (10 min., 4 °C) to remove unbroken cells and nuclei (post-nuclear supernatant (PNS)) and then at 20,000 × g (30 min, 4 °C) to precipitate plasma membrane and organelles. The PNS pellet was then resuspended in hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.05% Triton X-100 and 150 mm KCl. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads were added to the PNS fraction and mixed overnight at 4 °C. Streptavidin complexes were precipitated by centrifugation and repeatedly washed twice with 1 m KCl, twice with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, and once with ice-cold hypotonic buffer to isolate integral membrane proteins. Proteins were subsequently precipitated with a mixture of trichloroacetic acid/acetone to allow for removal of lipids. The proteins were further concentrated by the addition of 20% trichloroacetic acid and incubation on dry ice for 30 min. The proteins were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed with cold acetone, and finally solubilized in urea solubilization buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (18Wang D. de la Fuente C. Deng L. Wang L. Zilberman I. Eadie C. Healey M. Stein D. Denny T. Harrison L.E. Meijer L. Kashanchi F. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7266-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with pre-cast gradient gels (4–20% Tris-glycine; Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or silver-stained using the SilverQuest kit (Invitrogen) or were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis. BTK (611116) and XIAP (610762) antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences, GRP94 (SPA-850) was from Stressgen, and Fas (C-20), PARP (H-250), caspase-3 (H-277), Mcl-1 (S-19), and actin (C-11) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis (Isoelectric Focusing/SDS-PAGE)—ACH2 (HIV+) and CEM (HIV-) plasma membrane fractions (PMF) in urea solubilization buffer were supplemented further with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis sample rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) BioLyte 3/10 ampholytes, and bromphenol blue (trace)) (Bio-Rad). Processed samples from 5 × 108 cell equivalents were loaded onto an 11-cm pH 3–10 immobilized pH gradient strip through passive rehydration (16 h, room temperature). PMF proteins were focused for a total of 35,000 Vh (15 min at 250-V linear mode, 8000 V for 2:30-h linear mode and 8000 V to 25,000 Vh in rapid mode). Equilibration of immobilized pH gradient strips and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were performed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Bio-Rad) on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel. Gels were stained with mass spectrometry-compatible silver stain (Invitrogen). Imaging of gels was performed using the Bio-Rad FluorS imager. Numbered spots were cut out and further analyzed by trypsin in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as previously described (19Wu K. Bottazzi M.E. de La Fuente C. Deng L. Gitlin S.D. Maddukuri A. Li H. Vertes A. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 495-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Individual protein spots were excised from the silver-stained two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gel and destained using the SilverQuest kit (Invitrogen). Trypsin-digested sample solutions were further desalted and concentrated with C18 ZipTips (Millipore). Samples were mixed with an equal volume of the matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycynnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). Two microliters of the mixtures were applied to the sample plate and introduced into the mass spectrometer after drying. Mass spectra were recorded in the reflectron mode of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Axima CFR Plus, Kratos) operated in delayed extraction mode. Proteins were identified using the peptide mass fingerprinting analysis software Profound, Prospector, and Mascot. The NCBInr and SwissProt databases were used for the searches utilizing a maximum of one missed cleavage by trypsin and a mass tolerance of 1 Da. In general, all spots were searched with biotinylation as a variable modification and no-limitation for pI and protein mass. The identified proteins were chosen on the basis of having a low expectation value and also having a molecular weight and pI that is consistent with the values observed on our two-dimensional gel electrophoresis gel, with limitation of the taxonomic category to Homo sapiens. For cell cycle analysis, cells treated or untreated with drugs were collected by low speed centrifugation and washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and fixed with 70% ethanol. For fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, cells were stained with a mixture of propidium iodide (PI) solution (PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, 10 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml PI) for 30 min at room temperature before analysis. The cells were acquired and analyzed using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Acquired FACS data were analyzed by ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Inc.). HLM-1 or HeLa T4+ cells were grown on glass slides for 6 days in the presence or absence of 2 mm sodium butyrate (NaB). On day 4, cells were transfected with pGFP-BTK, a plasmid that expresses a BTK-GFP fusion protein (16Nore B.F. Vargas L. Mohamed A.J. Branden L.J. Backesjo C.M. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Hultenby K. Christensson B. Smith C.I. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection (6 days after NaB stimulation), cells were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher) at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Next, cells were washed with PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+. After the wash, cells were incubated with RNase A at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 37 °C and washed again with PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+. Cells were incubated with the nuclear stain TOTO-3, a dimeric cyanine nucleic acid stain from Molecular Probes, at 2 μm for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C. Slides were washed with water, and coverslips were mounted using Prolong anti-fade (Molecular Probes). Slides were viewed with a Bio-Rad MRC1024 confocal laser scanning microscope using the 60× oil objective and Bio-Rad LaserSharp software Version 5.2. Double excitation at 488 (for detection of GFP) and 647 nm (for DNA stain) was used. Optical sections were taken using z dimensions of 1.0 μm. Pictures were produced using Adobe Photoshop5.0 and Bio-Rad plug-ins. Surface Protein Biotinylation and Plasma Membrane Protein Isolation—We analyzed the differential expression of surface proteins in T-cells latently infected or uninfected with HIV-1 to identify surface markers for latency and targets for antibody or drug development. Surface proteins were labeled using a biotin-directed affinity purification method described in Fig. 1. In this procedure Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (EZ-Link from Pierce) reacts with ɛ-amines on surface proteins to form a stable complex on intact CEM and ACH2 cells. After surface biotinylation, centrifugation, streptavidin affinity purification, and washing, PMF proteins were isolated, and specific recovery of proteins was determined. No proteins were isolated from cells that were not treated with biotin (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 4), demonstrating that the proteins isolated from cells treated with biotin (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3) were specifically pulled down by streptavidin beads. To test for the presence of protein contaminants from other organelles in the PMF, we assayed for GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum-specific protein. GRP94 was only detected in the PNS of ACH2 and CEM cells but not in the PMFs as determined by Western blot (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 1 and 3), suggesting that there is no contaminating organelle proteins in our plasma membrane preparation. On the other hand, the plasma membrane protein Fas was detected in the PMFs of biotin-labeled ACH2 and CEM cells, indicating enrichment of plasma membrane-specific proteins in these fractions (Fig. 2B, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3). Throughout our preparation, high salt and high pH buffers have been employed specifically to abolish non-covalent protein associations and depolymerize actin bundles. Actin levels in PMF were low as compared with PNS (Fig. 2B, bottom panel, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 6), showing that our wash conditions removed most of the actin associated with the membrane fractions. These results suggest that the isolated PMFs are enriched with plasma membrane proteins and have very low or no cytoskeletal proteins or other subcellular compartment contaminants, consistent with previous studies employing surface biotinylation for the isolation of plasma membrane proteins (14Zhao Y. Zhang W. Kho Y. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 17Peirce M.J. Wait R. Begum S. Saklatvala J. Cope A.P. Mol. Cell.

A, surface biotinylation and differential centrifugation allows for specific recovery of proteins. PMF proteins were isolated as described in Fig. 1. One-tenth (or 5 × 107 cell eq) of total PMF proteins isolated with and without biotin and 30 μg of PNS were separated by SDS-PAGE then stained with Coomassie Blue and imaged using Bio-Rad FluorS Imager. B, decrease of actin and endoplasmic reticulum-associated GRP94 suggests enrichment for plasma membrane proteins. One-tenth of total PMF proteins and 30 μg of PNS were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-GRP94 and anti-Fas antibodies. The blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-actin antibody.

Unique proteins from both cell lines (spots 1–17, Fig. 3A and B) were excised, in-gel-digested with trypsin, eluted from the gel, and identified by MALDI-TOF as previously described (19Wu K. Bottazzi M.E. de La Fuente C. Deng L. Gitlin S.D. Maddukuri A. Li H. Vertes A. Pumfery A. Kashanchi F. J. Biol.

Fig. 3C shows examples of peptide mass fingerprint spectra generated by MALDI-TOF after analysis of four different spots. Starred peaks refer to peptides matched for specific protein candidates found in the data base. Peptide sequences of the four selected spots in Fig. 3C are listed in Table 2, and the peptide sequences of all 17 spots are listed in supplemental Table 1. Interestingly, 47% of the identified proteins are integral membrane proteins, 18% are membrane-associated, 29% are cytoplasmic, many of which are associated with the cytoskeleton, and 6% are associated with the Golgi apparatus.TABLE 1List of all surface proteins unique to CEM and ACH2 identified by MALDI-TOF analysis For all the spots (1Singer S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2033056433,"MPP7, a previously uncharacterized member of the p55 Stardust family of membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins, was found in a tripartite complex with DLG1 and LIN7A or LIN7C. MPP7 dimerizes with all three LIN7 family members (LIN7A, -B, and -C) through interaction of the single L27 domain of LIN7 with the carboxyl-terminal L27 domain of MPP7, thereby stabilizing both proteins. The dimer of MPP7 with LIN7A or LIN7C associates with DLG1 through an interaction requiring the amino-terminal L27 domain of MPP7. The amino-terminal L27 domain of MPP7 is not sufficient for interaction with DLG1 but interacts efficiently only if MPP7 is in a complex with LIN7A or -C. Thus the specificity of interaction of DLG1 with the LIN7-MPP7 complex is determined by L27 interactions with both MPP7 and LIN7. The tripartite complex forms in a ratio of 1:1:1 and localizes to epithelial adherens junctions in a manner dependent upon MPP7. Expression of MPP7 stabilizes DLG1 in an insoluble compartment. Expression of MPP7 deleted of the PDZ or Src homology 3 domain redistributes MPP7, DLG1, and LIN7 out of adherens junctions and into the soluble cytoplasmic fraction without changing the localization of E-cadherin. Thus, the stability and localization of DLG1 to cell-cell junctions are complex functions determined by the expression and association of particular Stardust family members together with particular LIN7 family members.

MAGUK proteins are found at synapses, adherens junctions, and tight junctions and contain at least one PDZ domain (that interacts with short peptide sequences typically at the carboxyl terminus of interacting proteins), an SH3 domain, and a GUK domain (catalytically inactive guanylate kinase domain) that serve as docking sites for cellular proteins. Many MAGUK proteins also contain one or two L27 domains that heterodimerize with L27 domains found on other MAGUK proteins, resulting in multimerization of MAGUK proteins (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The prototype MAGUK protein is DLG1, which has served as a model protein in studies of cellular localization and protein association for this family. Drosophila DLG was identified as a tumor suppressor gene in flies with a tumor-like overgrowth and disorganization of the larval imaginal disks (2Stewart M. Murphy C. Fristrom J.W. Dev. Biol. 1972; 27: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The Drosophila DLG protein localizes to septate junctions, and mutants were found to have a loss of septate junctions (the invertebrate analog of mammalian tight junctions). Mammalian DLG1 complements the defects observed in DLG flies (3Thomas U. Phannavong B. Muller B. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Mech. Dev. 1997; 62: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans DLG is required for proper assembly of the zonula adherens (4Bossinger O. Klebes A. Segbert C. Theres C. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 2001; 230: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Although DLG1 in mammals has not yet been shown to have a tumor suppressor phenotype, loss of DLG1 or other MAGUK genes results in developmental defects, illustrating the importance of this family in the control tissue morphogenesis (5Caruana G. Bernstein A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen M.M. Nguyen M.L. Caruana G. Bernstein A. Lambert P.F. Griep A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8970-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It is possible that the large numbers of mammalian MAGUK genes are able to complement defective alleles of individual genes. A second subgroup of MAGUK proteins is represented by the Drosophila Stardust protein that is required for the establishment of cell polarity in the developing Drosophila embryo (7Tepass U. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The single PDZ domain of Stardust associates with the apical transmembrane protein Crumbs through a PDZ ligand on Crumbs (8Bachmann A. Schneider M. Theilenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E. Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 9Hong Y. Stronach B. Perrimon N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 2001; 414: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar); both Crumbs and Stardust are required for the establishment of cell polarity. Mammals have at least seven Stardust homologs termed MPP1–7. Mammalian MPP5, also known as PALS1 (for “partner associated with LIN7”), acts similarly to Stardust, linking the mammalian homolog of Crumbs and the tight junction protein PATJ (10Roh M.H. Makarova O. Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, LIN7 (also known as Veli or MALS) is necessary for vulva development and is required for localization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (11Simske J.S. Kaech S.M. Harp S.A. Kim S.K. Cell. 1996; 85: 195-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). LIN7 contains single L27 and PDZ domains. There are three mammalian LIN7 homologs (LIN7A, -B, and -C) and three mammalian Stardust-like proteins described as associating with LIN7 as follows: MPP3, MPP5 (also known as PALS1), and MPP6 (also known as PALS2) (12Karnak D. Lee S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46730-46735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 13Kamberov E. Makarova O. Roh M. Liu A. Karnak D. Straight S. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because of the large number of MAGUK proteins with overlapping functions, the role of MAGUK proteins in the regulation of mammalian cell growth remains unresolved. One provocative observation has been the association of MAGUK proteins with viral regulatory proteins and oncoproteins. Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I Tax has a PDZ-binding ligand at the carboxyl terminus of the protein that is necessary for full virus-induced T-cell proliferation in vitro and full infection and persistence in vivo (14Xie L. Yamamoto B. Haoudi A. Semmes O.J. Green P.L. Blood. 2006; 107: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); the PDZ ligand of Tax interacts with a number of PDZ-containing proteins, including DLG1 (reviewed in Ref. 15Hall W.W. Fujii M. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The E4orf1 protein is required to cause rat mammary mesenchymal sarcomas and myoepitheliomas by adenovirus type 9 (16Javier R. Raska Jr., K. Macdonald G.J. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Javier R. Raska Jr., K. Shenk T. Science. 1992; 257: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Ankerst J. Jonsson N. Kjellen L. Norrby E. Sjogren H.O. Int. J. Cancer. 1974; 13: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); E4orf1 contains a PDZ ligand that interacts with a number of cellular PDZ proteins at adherens and tight junctions (19Latorre I.J. Roh M.H. Frese K.K. Weiss R.S. Margolis B. Javier R.T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4283-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and this ligand is required for the transformation of rat mammary cells by E4orf1 (20Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7873-7880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E4orf1 associates with the DLG1 protein, resulting in the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (21Frese K.K. Latorre I.J. Chung S.H. Caruana G. Bernstein A. Jones S.N. Donehower L.A. Justice M.J. Garner C.C. Javier R.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1406-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins also associate with the DLG1 protein (22Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A. Fujita M. Hayashi Y. Akiyama T. Ishibashi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11612-11616Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 23Lee S.S. Weiss R.S. Javier R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) as well as other cellular PDZ proteins through a PDZ ligand at the carboxyl terminus of E6 (24Jing M. Bohl J. Brimer N. Lyons C. Vande Pol S.B. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2231-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Jeong K.W. Kim H.Z. Kim S. Kim Y.S. Choe J.

Laura R. Hepner K. Guccione E. Sawyers C. Lasky L. Banks L. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5088-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Papillomaviruses are causative agents of benign tumors of cutaneous and mucosal squamous epithelia. Subsets of papillomaviruses induce mucosal epithelial tumors that may develop into epithelial malignancies; these types are termed “high risk” HPV types (prototypes are HPV-16, -18, and -31). Transgenic expression of E6 oncoproteins within the mouse skin is sufficient to induce epithelial hyperplasia and focal squamous cell carcinomas; analysis of E6 mutants established that this phenotype requires the presence of a PDZ ligand at the carboxyl terminus of E6. This implicates cellular PDZ proteins as targets for E6 oncogenicity. To identify cellular PDZ proteins that interact with E6, we have used a proteomics approach to identify complexes of cellular proteins that interact with the HPV-16 E6 (16E6) PDZ ligand, and we have characterized a tripartite complex containing LIN7, a Stardust family protein termed MPP7, and DLG1. Cells and Tissue Culture and Transfections—293T, CV-1, and MDCK cells were obtained from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. HaCat squamous keratinocytes were maintained in 7.5% calf serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media. Cell lines were transfected with FuGENE 6 in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions to E6 proteins have been described previously (28Vande Pol S.B. Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The last 10 amino acids of 16E6 (amino acids 142–151, the intact PDZ ligand) or amino acids 142–149 (the mutated PDZ ligand) were cloned as fusions to GST followed by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. For transient expression of proteins in mammalian cells, genes were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with two tandem copies of monoclonal antibody epitope tags for EE, FLAG, HA, or MYC monoclonal antibodies. For retroviral transduction of mammalian cells, cDNA open reading frames or site-directed mutant genes were cloned into pQCXi with monoclonal antibody epitope tags and retrovirus-packaged by transient transfection of Phoenix Ampho cells (provided by Dr. Gary Nolan, Stanford University) together with an expression plasmid for the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein. MPP7 was cloned from human keratinocyte NIKS cells (29Flores E.R. Allen-Hoffmann B.L. Lee D. Sattler C.A. Lambert P.F. Virology. 1999; 262: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) by RT-PCR using 5′-ATGccagctttgtcaacgggatctgg and 3′-ttatgaatgtaaccagctcactgg oligonucleotides. cDNA expression plasmids were generously provided for LIN7A, -B, and -C (Paul Welling, University of Maryland) and DLG1 (Lawrence Banks, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy). Affinity Purification of PDZ Domain Proteins—GST fusions to the PDZ ligand of 16E6 or a mutated PDZ ligand were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (30Bohl J. Das K. Dasgupta B. Vande Pol S.B. Virology. 2000; 271: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 25 confluent 15-cm plates of HaCat cells per sample were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed on ice with 0.5× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer is 150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaF; 5 mm NaPPi; 1% IPEGAL CA-630; 0.01% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mm sodium vanadate; 1 μg/ml leupeptin/aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Clarified lysates were pre-cleared on 3.0-ml columns of glutathione-agarose. The flow-through was then incubated with 20 μg of GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h on ice. The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with Nonidet P-40 buffer without protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were released by cleavage with tobacco etch virus protease in the manufacturer's supplied buffer supplemented with 0.1% IPEGAL CA-630. Eluted proteins were freeze-dried, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and applied to 4–20% NOVEX polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), stained first with Coomassie Blue, and then restained with silver to visualize protein bands. The gel bands were subsequently cut from the gel and destained. The proteins were reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin in the gel. The peptides formed in the digestion were extracted, concentrated, and characterized by capillary column liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Data base searches using the program SEQUEST were used to identify the protein by matching the collision-induced dissociation spectra. These matching spectra were verified by manual inspection of the collision-induced dissociation spectra. In Vitro Translation and in Vitro Binding Assays—In vitro coupled transcriptions and translations were performed utilizing standard nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysate (Promega), according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and supplemented with 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm nucleotide triphosphates, and 25 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) per 50-μl translation reaction. For in vitro binding assays, 25 μl of reticulocyte lysate programmed to express the indicated proteins were incubated on ice for 30 min at 4 °C, and then 175 μl of 0.5× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing precipitating antibody and protein A-Sepharose or bead-immobilized GST fusion were added, and binding was allowed to proceed at 4 °C with rocking for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with 1.5 ml of 0.5× Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Retained proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, blotted to PVDF membranes, Ponceau-stained, and subjected to autoradiography or quantitative β-scanning with a Packard Instant Imager. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer or cell lysates from cells lysed in 1% SDS were equalized for protein content as determined with a commercial kit (BioRad) before electrophoresis; equalized proteins boiled in complete SDS sample buffer were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Monoclonal antibody sources were as follows: epitope tags were obtained from Sigma (M2 FLAG monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibody), the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (MYC clone 9E10), Cell Signaling (anti-MYC epitope tag clone 9B11), and Dr. Gernot Walter (EE, University of California, San Diego, and rabbit polyclonal antibody from Covance), and 12CA5 monoclonal antibody to the influenza hemagglutinin protein from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal antibodies to E-cadherin and DLG1 were from BD Biosystems; monoclonal antibody to tubulin were from Sigma, and monoclonal antibody to dog ZO-1 was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (clone R26.4C). We performed an in vitro binding assay using just the last 10 amino acids of HPV-16 E6 (16E6) compared with the same peptide minus the very last 2 amino acids, destroying the PDZ ligand of 16E6. Mass spectrometry identified Scribble/Vertau, DLG1/SAP-97, CASK/LIN2, PSD-95/DLG4, MPP7 (a human p55 family member analogous to Drosophila Stardust), and LIN7 family members (primarily LIN7C; data not shown). We have focused this study upon the uncharacterized MPP7 protein and its interaction with DLG1 and LIN7. p55 MAGUK Protein MPP7—The MPP7 open reading frame cDNA was isolated using RT-PCR and mRNA from immortalized human keratinocytes. Four full-length open reading frame clones were fully sequenced. Three were identical and corresponded to human EST sequences described previously in a study that had predicted the existence of MPP7 by sequence data base examination (31Katoh M. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 13: 333-338PubMed Google Scholar), and they differed by two silent nucleotide changes from the open reading frame of GenBank™ accession number NM_173416. The domain structures of MPP7 and MPP7 mutants used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Preliminary Analysis of the Association of PDZ Proteins with Each Other and with 16E6—Initial experiments were performed to identify potential direct associations with 16E6 by in vitro translation of each of the proteins in rabbit reticulocyte lysate followed by association with immobilized 16E6. Because of the common association of DLG1 with viral oncoproteins and the presumed importance of the 16E6 interaction with DLG1, we have in this study analyzed potential complexes formed with DLG1 first. Initial in vitro binding of in vitro-translated DLG1, LIN7A, and MPP7 each bound 16E6; however, a clear enhancement of the LIN7 and MPP7 interaction with 16E6 was found when both were incubated together, indicating that either a possible complex of MPP7 plus LIN7A bound better to 16E6 or that such a complex efficiently bound to DLG1 and that this complex bound efficiently to the PDZ ligand of E6 (supplemental Fig. S1). Association of MPP7 with LIN7—To determine whether MPP7 could form a complex with LIN7A, both proteins were translated in vitro, mixed together, and then immune precipitated with an epitope tag on LIN7A, revealing that a complex formed in vitro (Fig. 2A). To determine the stoichiometry, the two proteins were translated in vitro at constant specific activity with separate epitope tags on each protein. The complex was tandem affinity-purified (TAP) first by immune precipitation with the FLAG tag on MPP7, and the peptide was eluted with FLAG peptide and then re-precipitated with antibody to the HA epitope on LIN7A. The LIN7A protein in vitro-translated in two forms, a slower migrating form containing the HA epitope and a faster migrating form that initiated translation internal to the HA epitope. Because only the slower migrating form was present in the TAP product (Fig. 2A, lane 2), it can be inferred that the LIN7A-MPP7 complex was a dimer in which higher order associations were not detected. To determine which domains of MPP7 associated with LIN7A, amino-terminal deletions of MPP7 (Fig. 1) were tested for in vitro association with LIN7A, revealing that although the L27N domain of MPP7 was dispensable, the L27C domain was required for the association (Fig. 2B). Similarly, carboxyl-terminal deletions of MPP7 revealed that the GUK, hook, SH3, and PDZ domains were dispensable, whereas the L27C domain was required (Fig. 2C). These experiments reveal that the interaction of LIN7A with MPP7 required the L27C domain of MPP7. Association of DLG1 with the LIN7-MPP7 Complex—To determine whether DLG1 associated with MPP7 with or without LIN7A, the three proteins were separately translated in vitro and then mixed together in various combinations and immune precipitated using amino-terminal monoclonal antibody epitope tags (supplemental Fig. S2). DLG1 failed to associate with either LIN7A or MPP7 alone but efficiently associated with MPP7 together with LIN7A. In the initial identification of MPP7 by mass spectrometry, we identified peptides that were unique to LIN7C as well as peptides common to all three LIN7 gene products. To determine whether all three LIN7 family members can associate with MPP7 and to determine their potential role in association with DLG1 as well, each protein was translated in vitro and tested for in vitro association with MPP7 and DLG1. All three LIN7 family members (LIN7A, -B, and -C) associated with MPP7 in vitro, but only complexes formed between LIN7A and LIN7C together with MPP7 efficiently associated with DLG1 (Fig. 3A). To determine the ratio of the three proteins in the complex, the three proteins were translated in vitro to the same specific radioactivity, mixed together, then immune precipitated first with FLAG antibody tag on DLG1, washed, eluted with FLAG peptide, and then re-precipitated using MYC antibody directed against tagged MPP7. The MPP7 translation product, like LIN7A in Fig. 2A, contains both a slower migrating epitope-tagged and a faster migrating untagged product (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–8), which are both present in the FLAG-DLG1 immune precipitate (lane 4). However, only MYC-tagged MPP7 is present in the TAP product (Fig. 3B, lane 2), demonstrating that in vitro complexes between DLG1, MPP7, and LIN7A contain single molecules of MPP7, with multimers of MPP7 not observed. The TAP products were quantitated and normalized for methionine content, and net counts above background were calculated, with the ratio of DLG1:MPP7:LIN7A being 1.0:0.98:1.2 which is close to a theoretical 1:1:1 ratio. Thus, the three proteins form a tripartite complex. Initial experiments indicated that DLG1 only associated with either MPP7 or HA-LIN7 if the L27N domain was present on MPP7 (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, LIN7A forms a complex with MPP7 requiring the L27C domain of MPP7, and this dimer associates with DLG1 requiring the L27N domain of MPP7. It was possible that DLG1 might interact directly with only the L27N domain of MPP7. In this model, interaction of LIN7A with the L27C domain of MPP7 might make the L27N domain of MPP7 available for interaction with DLG1. To test this possibility, carboxyl-terminal deletions of MPP7 were incubated with a GST fusion to the DLG1 L27 domain (DLG1 amino acids 1–228) in the presence or absence of LIN7A (Fig. 3C). A very weak interaction between DLG1 and MPP7 was observed in the absence of LIN7A that was not affected by deletion of the MPP7 L27C (Fig. 3C, middle panel, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that MPP7 L27N interactions are not repressed by the L27C domain. In the presence of LIN7A, there was a 12.4-fold enhancement of MPP7 bound by DLG1. (In the presence of LIN7A, 5.1% of the input counts of MPP7 were retained on the GST-DLG1_1–228 beads, whereas in the absence of LIN7A, only 0.41% of the input counts was retained.) The enhancement of the MPP7-DLG1 interaction required the presence of the L27C domain of MPP7 (Fig. 3C, top panel, compare lanes 4 and 5). To confirm that the MPP7 interaction with the DLG1 L27 domain was similar to the interaction with the full DLG1 molecule, the same series of MPP7 deletion mutants was incubated together with cold-translated full-length EE-DLG1 with or without cold-translated LIN7A (Fig. 3D). DLG1 was immune precipitated, and associated MPP7 or MPP7 mutants were identified by autoradiography. Similar to the results of Fig. 3C, the efficient association of DLG1 with MPP7 required LIN7A and the presence of the L27C domain of MPP7. Addition of LIN7A caused a 13.3-fold increase in DLG1-associated full-length MPP7 compared with vector-programmed reticulocyte lysate. Stabilization of MPP7, LIN7, and DLG1 by Formation of a Tripartite Complex—To determine whether the LIN7-MPP7-DLG1 tripartite complex defined in vitro also forms in vivo, mammalian cells were transfected with epitope-tagged DLG1, MPP7, and LIN7A and analyzed by immune precipitation for formation of the tripartite complex. Fig. 4A shows that DLG1 does not associate with either MPP7 or LIN7A alone, but it associates only when both LIN7A and MPP7 are co-expressed together with DLG1. Fig. 4B shows the whole cell lysates for Fig. 4A, revealing that MPP7 and LIN7A are both expressed at higher levels when co-expressed together (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4 compared with lane 6). Similarly, DLG1 is expressed at high levels only when co-expressed together with both LIN7A and MPP7, indicating that the complex of MPP7 and LIN7 stabilizes each other and that the dimer of LIN7 and MPP7 stabilizes DLG1. To determine whether the associations defined in vitro and in transient transfections in vivo were found under stable expression conditions in vivo, MDCK cells were separately and retrovirally transduced with epitope-tagged LIN7A, -B, and -C. Fig. 5A shows that expression levels of DLG1 in these cells were similar to untransduced MDCK cells, and DLG1 was found in a complex with LIN7A and -C but to a much lesser extent than LIN7B, correlating to the in vitro binding assay of Fig. 3A. In separate retroviral transductions, FLAG-MPP7 and FLAG-MPP7Δ135–576 (expressing only MPP7, L27N, and L27C) were introduced into MDCK cells and selected by G418 drug resistance, followed by LIN7A, -B, or -C selected by hygromycin resistance. Drug-selected cells were passaged for 6 weeks, followed by analysis of DLG1 expression levels. Introduction of MPP7 into MDCK cells resulted in increased expression of DLG1 (Fig. 5B, lane 4 compared with lane 6). Further introduction of LIN7 proteins resulted in enhanced expression of MPP7 compared with expression of MPP7 alone (Fig. 5B, lanes 1–3 compared with lane 4). This correlates with the enhanced expression observed by transient co-expression of MPP7 and LIN7A (Fig. 4B). Introduction of MPP7Δ135–576 resulted in a dramatic elevation of DLG1 expression. Immune precipitation of wild type MPP7 revealed that DLG1 was associated with both full-length and the deleted MPP7 (possibly through associations with endogenous LIN7), and in cells stably expressing MYC-LIN7 proteins, DLG associated with MPP7 together with LIN7A and LIN7C but not LIN7B, paralleling the in vitro binding assays of Fig. 3A. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed no differences in RNA expression of DLG1 between MDCK cells and MDCK cells expressing MPP7, LIN7C, or both MPP7 and LIN7C (data not shown), whereas the half-life of DLG1 protein was prolonged in MDCK cells expressing MPP7 compared with vector-transduced MDCK cells (supplemental Fig. S4). Cytoskeleton Association of MPP7 and DLG1—Deletion mutants of MPP7 (illustrated in Fig. 2) were also stably transduced into MDCK cells and analyzed for association with DLG1 and partitioning between the soluble cellular extract and the cytoskeleton-containing pellet. Mutants of MPP7, which contained both L27 motifs and associated with both LIN7 and DLG1 in vitro, formed a complex with DLG1 in vivo and increased expression levels of DLG1 in vivo (Fig. 5C). Mutants of MPP7 that did not associate with either DLG1 or LIN7 in vitro (Fig. 2C and Fig. 3, C and D) did not enhance DLG1 expression or associate with DLG1 in vivo. MPP7 expression enhanced DLG1 expression in both the soluble and pellet fractions, but MPP7 mutants that were deleted of the SH3-GUK region greatly enhanced DLG1 expression in the soluble fraction and appeared to reduce DLG1 expression in the insoluble pellet fraction (Fig. 5C, lanes 3 and 4). Localization of MPP7 and DLG1—MDCK cells are a model system for the localization of DLG1 and other MAGUK proteins because they form well structured tight adherens junctions. FLAG-MPP7 and mutants were introduced by stable retroviral transduction. In MDCK cells E-cadherin was localized at cell junctions as expected. DLG1 was localized in three cellular compartments as follows: at cell junctions co-localized with E-cadherin, in intranuclear spots, and distributed in small cytoplasmic dots (Fig. 6A) (32McLaughlin M.

It is structurally and functionally related to the yeast protein kinase, Snf1, which gives the family its name, and to mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). SnRK1 phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, sucrose phosphate synthase, nitrate reductase, trehalose-phosphate synthase and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2/6-bisphosphatase (2Halford N.G.

In addition, SnRK1 is required for redox modulation of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity in response to sucrose (5Tiessen A. Prescha K. Branscheid A. Palacios N. McKibbin R. Halford N.G. Geigenberger P. Plant J. 2003; 35: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and, like its fungal and animal counterparts, is involved in regulating the expression of genes involved in carbon metabolism (2Halford N.G. Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Pathol. 2006; 43: 93-142Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, overexpression of SnRK1 in potato tubers causes an increase in starch content and a decrease in glucose levels resulting from a dramatic increase in the level of expression and activity of two key enzymes in the starch biosynthetic pathway, sucrose synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (6McKibbin R.S.

SnRK1 is regulated in part by phosphorylation on a threonine residue within the so-called “T-loop” (7Sugden C. Crawford R.M. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G.

The T-loop or “activation segment” is a region where many other protein kinases are activated by phosphorylation (9Johnson L.N. Noble M.E.M. Owen D.J.

Attempts to identify and clone protein kinases that phosphorylate SnRK1 have been given a new impetus by the identification of orthologous protein kinases in mammals (LKB1 and CaMKK) (4Harthill J.E.

A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Yeast offers some particular experimental advantages. For example, a yeast snf1 mutant is unable to derepress glucose-repressible activities and cannot grow on alternative carbon sources to glucose such as sucrose or nonfermentable carbon compounds such as glycerol or ethanol. Also, an elm1 sak1 tos3 triple mutant is unable to activate its Snf1 protein kinase; hence it too has a snf- phenotype and behaves like a snf1 mutant. This provides a simple way to test DNA sequences which potentially encode orthologs of the yeast Elm1, Sak1 and Tos3 proteins, since the expression of a single ortholog in a yeast elm1 sak1 tos3 triple mutant will restore growth on sucrose and nonfermentable carbon sources. We have used this approach to confirm that two Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) DNA sequences, hitherto known only by their data base accession numbers of NM_125448.3 (protein ID NP_200863) and NM_114393.3 (protein ID NP_566876) each functionally complement a yeast elm1 sak1 tos3 triple mutant. We further show that both plant proteins can phosphorylate a peptide with the amino acid sequence of the phosphorylation site in the T-loop of SnRK1. Data Base Searches—Searches of the Arabidopsis genome gene products were performed using the BLAST facility at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The amino acid sequences used for the initial searches were those given in data base entries NP_011336 (Tos3), AAA02892 (Elm1) and NP_011055 (Sak1). Yeast Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae wild type strain MSY182 (MATa ura3–52 leu2Δ0 his3Δ200 trp1Δ63) and mutant strain MSY857 (MATα ura3Δ0 leu2Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ sak1::KANMX4 elm1::KANMX4 tos3:: KANMX4) were kindly provided by Martin Schmidt (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA). Complex media comprised per liter yeast extract (10 g), bacteriological peptone (20 g), adenine (0.1 g), uracil (0.1 g), and either glucose (20 g) (in YPD) or glycerol (30 ml) in YPG. Synthetic complete media comprised per liter BactoYeast Nitrogen Base (BD Biosciences) (1.67 g), ammonium sulfate (5 g) and all appropriate supplements (20 mg of each) with either glucose (20 g) (“SC-glucose”) or glycerol (30 ml) and ethanol (20 ml) (“SC-glycerol-ethanol”). Agar (2% w/v) was used to solidify the media. Plasmids, Transformation, and Plasmid Curing—Plasmid pVTL260, which has leu2d as the selectable marker and uses the yeast ADH1 promoter and terminator for expression in yeast, was obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). The two Arabidopsis DNA sequences were generated by reverse transcription-PCR using primers designed to amplify between (and including) the initial methionine and the stop codon at the end of the ORF in both cases. The primers also contained a NheI site to facilitate insertion into the NheI site of the plasmid. This also placed a His6 tag at the N terminus of the expressed proteins. The new plasmids were checked by sequencing. Transformation of strain MSY857 was carried out as described by Ito et al. (18Ito H. Funkuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were sought which could grow on synthetic complete medium with glycerol and ethanol as carbon source. Putative transformants were “cured” of plasmid by 3×-serial subculture (0.5 ml into 100 ml of liquid YPD medium at 30 °C for 24 h, where the plasmid is not required for growth) and finally plated onto solid YPD medium. Individual colonies were subsequently picked and patched onto a fresh YPD plate. After 2–3 days, the patches on the YPD plate were replica-plated to YPD, SC-glucose, and SC-glycerol-ethanol plates. Clones, which were no longer capable of growth on SC-glycerol-ethanol, were examined for the presence of the original plasmid and compared with the initial transformants and those cells that retained the ability to grow on SC-glycerol-ethanol. Protein Kinase Assays—Yeast strains were grown in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto Peptone) including glucose at 2% (w/v) at 30 °C until the A600 reached ∼2.0. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 2 min, washed twice in “repressing medium” (fresh medium containing 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.05% (w/v) sucrose) or “derepressing medium” (fresh medium containing 0.05% (w/v) glucose, 0.05% (w/v) sucrose), as appropriate, then incubated for 30 min in the same medium. Harvesting was carried out as described (11Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) by rapid filtration onto Nylon-66 (0.45 μm pore size) filters. The cells were scraped off the membrane into 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C. Protein extracts were prepared according to Wilson et al., (11Wilson W.A. Hawley S.A. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1426-1434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar); 150 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) was added to the frozen cells, which were then thawed, suspended, and transferred to a 0.5-ml centrifuge tube containing 300 μl of acid-washed 0.4-mm glass beads on ice. The cells were disrupted by vortexing (5 × 30 s) and separated away from the glass beads by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 1 min. Cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. An aliquot of the extract was removed for protein quantification using the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) and the remainder snap-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C. The yeast extracts were assayed by measuring the rate of phosphorylation of the T-loop peptide (Ile-Met-Arg-Asp-Glu-His-Phe-Leu-Lys-Thr-Ser-Cys-Gly-Ser-Pro-Asn) using the assay described by Sugden et al. (20Sugden C. Donaghy P. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 257-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays were carried out in a microtitre plate at 30 °C for 10 min, and each extract was assayed in triplicate with and without the T-loop peptide present. Each assay contained 5 μl of MgATP mix (1 mm ATP-NaOH, pH 7.0, 12.5 kBq [γ-33P]ATP, 25 mm MgCl2), 7.5 μl of assay buffer (200 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm Na4PPi, 2.25 μm okadaic acid, 15 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number P9599)), 5 μl of either a 1 mm solution of the T-loop peptide or water, and 7.5 μl of crude protein extract (added to initiate the assay). An aliquot (15 μl) of the reaction was removed to Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2 cm) and the reaction quenched by dropping the paper into a 1% phosphoric acid bath. The paper was washed five times in 1% phosphoric acid for 5 min each, then for 5 min in acetone, air-dried, and transferred to 3.5 ml of scintillation mixture for counting. ORFs from Arabidopsis with High Sequence Similarity to Kinases in Yeast, Which Act Upstream of Snf1—Data base searches revealed that there are many ORFs in Arabidopsis that encode proteins with amino acid sequences similar to those of Elm1, Sak1, and Tos3 of S. cerevisiae but no “stand-out” obvious homologue (Table 1). Two sequences, NM_125448.3 (protein ID NP_200863) and NM_114393.3 (protein ID NP_566876), showed the highest similarity with both Tos3 and Sak1 and one of the highest similarities with Elm1. Nevertheless, a total of eight candidate sequences were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from Arabidopsis seedling total RNA and cloned into the yeast expression vector for testing by functional complementation of a yeast elm1 sak1 tos3 “triple mutant.” Of these, six were cloned successfully (Table 1). Analysis of their nucleotide sequences confirmed identity with the sequences reported in the data base.TABLE 1Arabidopsis sequences identified in BLAST searches using upstream kinases of Snf1 from yeast Tos3, Elm1, and Sak1 The table also shows a summary of the outcome of subsequent experiments.

The ability to use carbon sources other than glucose requires a fully functional Snf1. Since Snf1 function in yeast requires the upstream kinases Elm1 Sak1 and Tos3, an elm1 sak1 tos3 triple mutant cannot grow on glycerol (Fig. 1). However, transformation of strain MSY857 (elm1 sak1 tos3) with a plasmid expressing either NM_125448.3 or NM_114393.3 from Arabidopsis rendered it capable of growth on SC-glycerol-ethanol medium and other alternative carbon sources (Fig. 1). This implies that the Arabidopsis proteins encoded by NM_125448.3 and NM_114393.3 are able to substitute for one of the missing yeast upstream kinases. None of the other four Arabidopsis sequences tested showed this functional complementation. Transformants expressing either NM_125448.3 or NM_ 114393.3 appear to be elongated (Fig. 2) showing that the plant kinases do not complement the elongation defect. A yeast elm1 sak1 tos3 mutant expressing a truncated version of Elm1 lacking the C-terminal domain has been shown to have a similar phenotype (21Rubenstein E.M. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Plasmids of the expected size could be recovered from putative transformants that were capable of growth on glycerol (data not shown). Subjecting the putative transformants to a plasmid “curing” regime gave rise to a mixture of yeast clones: some were still able to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source, but some had now lost this ability (Fig. 3). It was not possible to demonstrate the presence of plasmid in those clones that had lost the ability to grow on a nonfermentable carbon source, whereas those that retained this ability still contained plasmid. The Protein Kinases Encoded by NM_125448.3 and NM_114893.3 Phosphorylate a Peptide Containing the Activation Site within the T-loop of SnRK1—SnRK1 is regulated in part by phosphorylation on a threonine residue within the socalled T-loop (7Sugden C. Crawford R.M. Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant J. 1999; 19: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the ability of the proteins encoded by NM_125448.3 and NM_114893.3 to phosphorylate this site was tested. Wild type yeast, mutant yeast strain MSY857, and MSY857 expressing either NM_125448.3 or NM_114393.3 were grown in medium containing 2% glucose and then transferred to medium containing 2% glucose, 0.05% sucrose for 30 min. Protein was extracted and assayed for the presence of an activity that could phosphorylate the T-loop peptide, the amino acid sequence of which Ile-Met-Arg-Asp-Glu-His-Phe-Leu-Lys-Thr-Ser-Cys-Gly-Ser-Pro-Asn is identical to the sequence within the “T-loop” activation site of SnRK1. There was some detectable “background” activity in the mutant strain, but much higher levels of activity in the wild type yeast (presumably attributable to the native yeast Sak1, Elm1, and Tos3 protein kinases) and the mutant strain expressing either NM_125448.3 or NM_114893.3 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, this activity approximately doubled in the wild type yeast on transfer to derepressing conditions, while that of the mutant strain expressing the plant proteins declined (data not shown). Also unexpected was the fact that a sucrose spike (0.05% w/v) was necessary for activity to be detectable. Nevertheless, the result showed quite clearly that the protein kinases encoded by NM_125448.3 and NM_114893.3 could phosphorylate the T-loop peptide and by inference the activation site of SnRK1. Upstream Activators of Snf1, AMPK, and SnRK1 Form a Family of Closely Related Protein Kinases—The proteins encoded by NM_125448.3 and NM_114393.3, which activate Snf1 in yeast and by inference SnRK1 of plants, were given the names AtSnAK1 and AtSnAK2 (Arabidopsis thaliana SnRK1-activating kinases). AtSnAK1 is a 407 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 46 kDa, while AtSnAK2 comprises 396 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 45 kDa. Their amino acid sequences are aligned with those of Tos3, Sak1 and Elm1, as well as mammalian upstream activators of AMPK, LKB1, and CaMKK1 in Fig. 5. The protein kinase catalytic domains (Tyr-107 to Val-370 of AtSnAK1) align well, but there is little or no similarity between any of the proteins outside this domain. Indeed, the plant proteins have a relatively truncated C terminus, particularly when compared with Sak1, which comprises 1142 amino acids. A protein-protein BLAST search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information “nr” data base was performed and the results are presented as a tree diagram (Fig. 6). The search identified SnAK-like sequences in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and rice (Oryza sativa) (BE79890.1 and NP-001051055.1, respectively). All four plant SnAKs contain a Gly-Ser substitution in subdomain VII of the protein kinase catalytic domain (position 258 of AtSnAK1). This glycine residue forms part of the Asp-Phe-Gly triplet that is conserved in the vast majority of protein kinases. A BLAST search using the subdomain VII sequence from AtSnAK1/2 identified only two other protein kinases with the Asp-Phe-Ser triplet; these were two otherwise unrelated protein kinases from zebrafish (Danio rerio) (XP_684489.1 and XP_690087.1). There may be other protein kinases with the Asp-Phe-Ser triplet that were not identified in this search, but clearly the substitution is a rare one. The BLAST search using the full-length AtSnAK1 sequence showed Sak1 and related protein kinases from other yeast species to be the most similar cluster to the SnAKs, followed by the animal CaMKK and LKB1-related protein kinases (Fig. 6). Tos3 and Elm1 are not similar enough to the plant SnAKs to appear in the figure, although the SnAKs are the most similar plant protein kinases to both. No other plant protein kinases appear in the figure. Indeed, the most similar group of plant protein kinases are the SnRKs, which, of course, form a separate cluster with the fungal and animal SNF1/AMPK-type protein kinases. We have identified two sequences in Arabidopsis that will restore the ability of an elm1 sak1 tos3 triple mutant of the yeast S. cerevisiae to utilize nonfermentable carbon sources. The protein kinases encoded by these sequences, which have been given the names AtSnAK1 and AtSnAK2, will phosphorylate a peptide comprising the activation site in the T-loop of SnRK1. We believe this is the first time that such orthologous upstream activators have been described in Arabiopsis or any other plant species. The members of the family of upstream activators of AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1 are clearly related and conserved, although it is notable that the degree of amino acid sequence similarity between the members of this family is considerably less than that between AMPK, Snf1, and SnRK1, which show ∼50% amino acid sequence similarity with each other in the kinase catalytic domain and less but still significant similarity in the C-terminal regulatory domain (22Halford N.G. Hardie D.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The lack of similarity in the C-terminal domains may be indicative of the different proteins being involved in separate signaling pathways that converge on AMPK/Snf1/SnRK1. Detailed analysis of the C-terminal domains of the yeast proteins has revealed that these regions are essential for pathway specificity (21Rubenstein E.M. McCartney R.R. Schmidt M.C. Eukaryotic Cell. 2006; 5: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Notably, deletion of the C-terminal domain of Elm1 has no effect on Snf1 signaling but prevents Elm1 from performing its normal function in the morphogenetic checkpoint signaling pathway. Cells lacking all three upstream kinases but transformed with a plasmid expressing an Elm1 lacking the C-terminal domain are able to activate Snf1 and utilize alternative carbon sources to glucose but are elongated, just like the cells described in the present study expressing AtSnAK1 or AtSnAK2. High levels of expression of Elm1 overcome the requirement for the C-terminal domain, and the cells have a normal morphology. The lack of similarity of the C-terminal domains of AtSnAK1 and AtSnAK2 with the much longer C-terminal domains of their yeast counterparts may also explain why the plant protein kinases do not respond to a shift from repressing to derepressing conditions. The metabolite that initiates signaling through this pathway in mammalian systems is AMP, but the metabolites that are sensed in plant and fungal systems have never been identified satisfactorily (reviewed by Halford (2Halford N.G. Adv. Bot. Res. Incorp. Adv. Plant Pathol. 2006; 43: 93-142Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar)). While there are many similarities between the animal, fungal, and plant systems there are also differences. For example, the plant SnRK1 pathway is the only one of the three to be activated specifically in response to sucrose. It is notable that activity of AtSnAK1 and AtSnAK2 could only be detected in the presence of a sucrose spike. We are indebted to Martin Schmidt (University of Pittsburgh) for his generosity in providing the yeast strains that made this work possible."

Little is known about the control of RNASEL expression; therefore, we examined the potential regulatory role of a conserved 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) in its mRNA. The 3′-UTR mediated a potent decrease in the stability of RNase-L mRNA, and of a chimeric β-globin-3′-UTR reporter mRNA. AU-rich elements (AREs) are cis-acting regulatory regions that modulate mRNA stability. Eight AREs were identified in the RNase-L 3′-UTR, and deletion analysis identified positive and negative regulatory regions associated with distinct AREs. In particular, AREs 7 and 8 served a strong positive regulatory function. HuR is an ARE-binding protein that stabilizes ARE-containing mRNAs, and a predicted HuR binding site was identified in the region comprising AREs 7 and 8. Co-transfection of HuR and RNase-L enhanced RNase-L expression and mRNA stability in a manner that was dependent on this 3′-UTR region. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that RNase-L mRNA associates with a HuR containing complex in intact cells. Activation of endogenous HuR by cell stress, or during myoblast differentiation, increased RNase-L expression, suggesting that RNase-L mRNA is a physiologic target for HuR.

These findings identify a novel mechanism of RNase-L regulation mediated by its 3′-UTR. The control of mRNA stability is a potent regulatory mechanism, as small changes in mRNA half-life result in dramatic changes in the mRNA available for translation into functional protein. Such post-transcriptional regulation provides a means to rapidly alter gene expression in response to diverse stimuli, and is frequently observed in genes encoding proteins with essential cellular functions such as proliferation and stress response. One of the most extensively studied RNA decay pathways involves AU-rich elements (AREs) 2The abbreviations used are: ARE, AU-rich element; IFN, interferon; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region; 2–5A, 2′,5′-oligoadenylate; AREBP, ARE-binding protein; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; IP, immunoprecipitation; TTP, tristetraprolin; HuR, Hu RNA binding protein family member; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; qPCR, quantitative PCR; RT, reverse transcriptase; TIAR, TIA-1-related. present in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNAs (1Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). The AUUUA sequence is a loose consensus that is found in many but not all AREs; the absence of a strict sequence motif likely reflects the importance of structural components in ARE function (2Fialcowitz E.J. Brewer B.Y. Keenan B.P. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22406-22417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The influence of AREs on mRNA turnover occurs through an interaction with ARE-binding proteins (AREBPs) that can function to destabilize or stabilize target mRNAs by modulating access to the decay machinery. Specifically, AREs modulate deadenylation, and decapping, two critical steps in mRNA decay (3Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 4Gao M. Wilusz C.J. Peltz S.W. Wilusz J.

Several AREBPs have been identified, and genetic manipulation of specific AREBPs in mice, such as HuR and tristetraprolin, resulted in dramatic and complex phenotypes that are associated with inflammation and stress response (7Katsanou V. Papadaki O. Milatos S. Blackshear P.J. Anderson P. Kollias G. Kontoyiannis D.L. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Taylor G.A.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). These phenotypes underscore the critical role of AREBPs in gene regulation in physiological and pathophysiological processes. It is estimated that 5–8% of the mRNAs in the human transcriptome contain putative ARE elements (9Bakheet T. Williams B.R. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D111-D114Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The current challenge lies in determining the specific mRNA targets of AREBPs that are responsible for the phenotypes associated with ARE-mediated regulation. RNase-L is the terminal component of an RNA decay pathway known as the 2–5A system that derives its name from the 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylates (pppA(2′p5′A)n, n ≥ 2) that are required for its activation (10Silverman R.H. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1805-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A family of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetases are activated by double-stranded RNA to polymerize ATP into 2–5A. 2–5A, in turn, binds the latent RNase-L resulting in its dimerization and activation. Activated RNase-L cleaves single-stranded viral, ribosomal, and mRNAs with a preference for UU and UA sequences. In addition to its nuclease function, a role for RNase-L in translational regulation was recently reported (11Le Roy F. Salehzada T. Bisbal C. Dougherty J.P. Peltz S.W. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RNase-L activity is attenuated by the inactivation of 2–5A by cellular phosphatases and a 2′-phosphodiesterase (12Kubota K. Nakahara K. Ohtsuka T. Yoshida S. Kawaguchi J. Fujita Y. Ozeki Y. Hara A. Yoshimura C. Furukawa H. Haruyama H. Ichikawa K. Yamashita M. Matsuoka T. Iijima Y. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13308-13317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The 2–5A system is an established mediator of interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral activity, and genetic approaches to manipulate RNase-L expression and activity revealed that it exerts potent antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and senescence-inducing activities independent of IFN treatment and virus infection (14Hassel B.A. Zhou A.

Consistent with a broader role for RNase-L as a natural constraint on cell proliferation, RNase-L was determined to function as a tumor suppressor by mapping of the hereditary prostate cancer-1 susceptibility allele (HPC1) to the RNASEL gene locus (17Carpten J. Nupponen N. Isaacs S. Sood R. Robbins C. Xu J. Faruque M. Moses T. Ewing C. Gillanders E. Hu P. Bujnovszky P. Makalowska I. Baffoe-Bonnie A. Faith D. Smith J. Stephan D. Wiley K. Brownstein M.

Most recently, a novel γ-retrovirus was detected at a high frequency in prostate cancer patients that were homozygous for the Arg462 → Gln RNase-L mutation, suggesting a functional overlap between its antiviral and tumor suppressor activities (19Urisman A. Molinaro R.J. Fischer N. Plummer S.J. Casey G. Klein E.A. Malathi K. Magi-Galluzzi C. Tubbs R.R. Ganem D. Silverman R.H. Derisi J.L. PloS Pathog. 2006; 2: e25Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). A few cellular mRNAs that are degraded in an RNase-L-dependent manner have been identified, but a direct substrate relationship with RNase-L, and a role in mediating RNase-L antiproliferative activities, has not been established for any candidate substrate (20Lewis J.A.

Hassel, unpublished data. identified a finite number of down-regulated genes that represent candidate RNase-L substrates, and determined that a significant number of mRNAs were up-regulated following RNase-L activation. These findings suggest that the biological activities of RNase-L involve an extensive reprogramming of one or more gene regulatory networks. As a mediator of the cellular response to microbial and antiproliferative stress stimuli, RNase-L must be rapidly activated then efficiently attenuated, to prevent the deleterious effects of its uncontrolled activity in cells. However, apart from activation by 2–5A, little is known about the regulation of RNase-L activity. 2′,5′-Oligoadenylate synthetase transcription is markedly induced by IFN, antiproliferative agents, or cell stress, providing a source of 2–5A in physiological conditions that require RNase-L activity. In contrast, RNase-L mRNA and protein are present at low basal levels in most cell types, and its enzyme activity is not associated with significant changes in RNase-L transcription (24Zhou A. Molinaro R.J. Malathi K. Silverman R.H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2005; 25: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that RNase-L expression may be rapidly and transiently regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Specifically, the presence of a conserved, 1.75-kb 3′-UTR in the RNase-L transcript prompted us to examine the role of RNase-L mRNA stability in the regulation of its expression. The RNase-L 3′-UTR contained multiple candidate AREs, and sequential deletion of these elements identified positive and negative regulatory regions. RNP (ribonucleoprotein) immunoprecipitation revealed that the AREBP, HuR, binds to the RNase-L mRNA in intact cells, and functions to increase its mRNA half-life and expression in a manner that is dependent on the two 3′-terminal AREs. Activation of endogenous HuR in response to stress stimuli, or during myoblast differentiation, corresponded to an increase in RNase-L expression and HuR-RNase-L mRNA interaction, suggesting that HuR regulates RNase-L in physiological conditions. In addition, the HuR-dependent regulation of RNase-L expression enhanced its antiviral activity demonstrating the capacity of this regulation to impact RNase-L function. These findings provide the first description of the post-transcriptional regulation of RNase-L expression by its 3′-UTR and HuR, and identify a novel mechanism by which the activity of the 2–5A pathway is controlled. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Expression Constructs—293T, HeLa, 2fTGH, and C2C12 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% balanced air at 37 °C. To induce differentiation C2C12 myoblasts cells were grown to 80–90% confluence, then transferred to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium-A (Invitrogen) for up to 5 days. Transfection experiments were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 as directed by the supplier (Invitrogen). RNase-L-3′-UTR expression constructs and deletion mutants used for transfection included the previously described RNASEL cDNA (25Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and are described below. The HuR expression construct was a generous gift from Myriam Gorospe (NIA, National Institutes of Health). pTRE-r βG-3′-UTR construct was generated by sequential PCR amplification of the RNase-L 3′-UTR with primers that added flanking BglII sites, cloning of the PCR product into the pCR-blunt-Topo vector (Invitrogen), and subcloning of the BglII 3′-UTR insert downstream of the rabbit β-globin gene in the pTRER β-wt vector (2Fialcowitz E.J. Brewer B.Y. Keenan B.P. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22406-22417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The pTRE-r βG-3′-UTR construct used in the experiments presented contained the poly(A) signals from the RNase-L 3′-UTR and the vector; however, the presence of an extra poly(A) signal did not alter β-globin-UTR expression or mRNA stability, as a construct that contained only the vector-derived poly(A) signal gave equivalent expression (data not shown). All clones were verified by sequencing. Cloning of the RNase-L 3′-UTR and Generation of 3′-UTR Mutants—The human RNase-L 3′-UTR was amplified from human genomic DNA using primers that flanked the stop codon and the predicted polyadenylation site: forward, 5′-GTCCCTGGCATCGTGTATTCCATA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTCACTACATACTAGGCCCACA-3′, and cloned in to pCR-blunt-Topo. The PCR product was subcloned into the unique SpeI site in the 3′-UTR of clone ZC5 in the pcDNA3.1 vector (25Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) to generate the full-length RNase-L construct (ZC5+, Fig. 1). To remove the poly(A) signal from the ZC5+ construct, the plasmid was amplified using forward, 5′-CACCATGGAGAGCAGGGATCAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAGTAAGCTTCACAAATGGGC-3′, primers, and subcloned in the pcDNA3.1 vector. To remove the poly(A) signal from the pTRE-rβG-3′-UTR construct, the forward primer, 5′-AGATCTGGACTGATTTGCTGGAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGATCTGAGTAAGCTTCACAAATGGGC-3′, were used and the PCR product was subcloned into the BglII sites of the parental plasmid. The cloning junctions and 3′-UTR were verified by sequencing (University of Maryland, Baltimore Biopolymer Core). The primers used for PCR in Fig. 1B to demonstrate that the 3′-UTR is contiguous with the coding region, and that the predicted poly(A) site is used are listed according to the PCR products A–D shown in Fig. 1B. PCR products A, B, and D were: forward primer, 5′-CTACCAGAACACTGTGGGTGAT-3′; reverse primer for A, 5′-CATATGCAGCATTAGGGGTCAA-3′; reverse primer for B, 5′-GAATGAGATTCCTGGAACCCCT3′; reverse primer for D, 5′-CTCTCACTACATACTAGGCCCACA-3′. For the PCR product C: forward primer, 5′-CTGGCCCAAGATTATTCATACCTAGCACTTTATAAATTTATG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCACCAGAAAAACGTAAGACAG-3′. RNase-L 3′-UTR deletion constructs were generated from a ZC5+ template by PCR with pfuHF DNA Polymerase. (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward primer for all the deletion constructs was ZC5F, 5′-CACCATGGAGAGCAGGGATCAT-3′; the reverse primers for these constructs were: Δ7–8, 5′-GCACCAGAAAAACGTAAGACAG-3′; Δ5–8, 5′-CTTCTTCAGACTCTGCCAAATG-3′; Δ4–8, 5′-TATGTTTTGGGCCTCATCTGGA-3′; Δ2–8, 5′-AGCTCACACTCTCTGAGTCTCA-3′; Δ1–8, 5′-CATATGCAGCATTAGGGGTCAA-3′. Internal deletions of AREs 2, 3, 7, 8, and the predicted HuR binding site were generated by PCR with ZC5+ as a template (QuikChange, Stratagene). The primers used for mutagenesis were: ΔARE2, forward primer, 5′-CTGGCCCAAGATTATTCATACCTAGCACTTTATAAATTTATG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CATAAATTTATAAAGTGCTAGGTATGAATAATCTTGGGCCAG-3′; ΔARE3, forward primer 5′-CCTAGCACTTTATAATGTGGTGTTATTGGTACC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GGTACCAATAACACCACATTATAAAGTGCTAGG-3′; ΔARE2&3, forward primer, 5′-CTGGCCCAAGATTATTCATGTGGTGTTATTGGTACC-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GGTACCAATAACACCACATGAATAATCTTGGGCCAG-3′; ΔARE7, forward primer, 5′-GTATACATTACATCTGAGTCAAAACAATCCTTTAAGGTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GACCTTAAAGGATTGTTTTGACTCAGATGTAATGTATAC-3′; ΔARE8, forward primer, 5′-GTTGATTAGGAACAAAGGCTTAAAAAATAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTATTTTTTAAGCCTTTGTTCCTAATCAAC-3′.

Analysis of RNA Expression and Half-life by Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent as directed by the supplier (Invitrogen). RNA was treated with DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 1 μl of stop solution at 65 °C for 15 min prior to analysis by Northern blot or qPCR. For qPCR analysis, 2 μg of DNase I-treated total RNA was used for reverse transcription to synthesize first strand cDNA using SuperScriptaseII RT (Invitrogen). Aliquots of the first strand cDNA were used in a standard PCR mixture (Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK) or in real time PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green as directed by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). For all primer sets, reactions were first conducted using a temperature gradient to optimize annealing conditions, and the absence of primer dimers was confirmed by melting condition analysis. RT reactions carried out in the absence of RT served as a negative control, and to detect PCR products generated from contaminating genomic DNA. PCR using plasmid templates served as positive controls. The sequences of the primers for detection of RNase-L were as follows: human coding region: forward, 5′-GCTCATTTGTACTGCGTTATGC-3′, reverse, 5′-CATTTTCTCAAGGAAAAGGC-3′;3′-UTR (used for the analysis of β-globin-3′-UTR): forward, 5′-GCACTGAAGAGAGCATTTGGCAGA-3′, reverse, 5′-GAGCTCCTAGACTGGGTATGGGAA-3′; rpl13a: forward 5′-CTCAAGGTCGTGCGTCTG-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGCTTTCTCTTTCCTCTTCTC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′, reverse, 5′-TTGATTTTGGAGGGATCTCG-3′; β-globin: forward, 5′-TGCATCTGTCCAGTGAGGAG-3′, reverse, 5′-AGCATTTGCAGAGGACAGGT-3′. To analyze the mRNA half-life of plasmid-encoded transcripts, cells were first transfected with the indicated plasmids, then, at 24 h post-transfection, the transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded into individual plates for treatment with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma). In this manner, samples used to determine mRNA half-life were derived from a single transfection, thereby eliminating potential differences in expression associated with variable transfection efficiencies. Total RNA was harvested at the time points indicated in the figures. Specific mRNAs were quantified by qPCR. Each analysis represents at least two independent experiments, and within an experiment, all reactions were performed in triplicate, and the Ct values were converted to RNA concentration using a standard curve. mRNA values from each time point were normalized to the constitutively expressed ribosomal protein transcript, rpl13A. mRNA values were graphed on semi-log axes, and first order turnover rates were calculated by nonlinear regression of the percentage of mRNA remaining as a function of time after actinomycin D treatment. Western Blotting—Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA). The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad), and an equal amount of protein (30 μg/lane unless otherwise indicated in figure legends) was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, and then sequentially reacted with the primary antibody for 1 h in blocking buffer and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma). The RNase-L monoclonal antibody (provided as a generous gift from Robert Silverman, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation) was used at a 1:2000 dilution. The α-actin (Sigma), neomycin-resistance (Upstate Biotechnology), and HuR (Santa Cruz) antibodies were used at 1:1000, 1:1000, and 1:500 dilutions, respectively. The immunoreactive complex was visualized using the Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) and exposure to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). RNP Immunoprecipitation—RNA-protein complexes were isolated from C2C12 myoblasts at day 3.5 of differentiation by lysing cells in PBL buffer (100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) to preserve native RNA-protein interactions. Lysate supernatants were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C using 15 μg of IgG (Sigma) and 50 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) that had been swollen in NT2 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin. Proteins that nonspecifically bound the protein-A/G-IgG complex were removed by centrifugation to generate the precleared lysate. For RNA immunoprecipitation, protein-A beads (100 μl) were first incubated (16 h, 4 °C) with 30 μg of IgG, goat anti-TIAR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-HuR (Upstate Biotechnology); beads were then washed 5 times in 1 ml of NT2 buffer before the lysate was added. Precleared cell lysate (3 mg) was then added to the protein-A/G-antibody complex and rotated for 2 h at 4°C. After washing 5 times in 1 ml of NT2 buffer, the complexes were treated sequentially with DNase I (5 min at 37 °C) then Proteinase K at 25 min at 55 °C. The RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform and precipitated in 0.3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5), EtOH at –20 °C for 24 h and resuspended in dH2O for analysis. The presence of specific mRNAs in the immunoprecipitated complex was determined by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers from the coding region of murine MyoD and RNase-L; the primers used for this analysis were: MyoD: forward, 5′-TACCCAAGGTGGAGATCCTG-3′, reverse 5′-CATCATGCCATCAGAGCAGT-3′; murine RNase-L: forward, 5′-CAATCGAGAAGTGGCTGTGA-3′, reverse, 5′-ATAGGATGCTGTGGGCAAAC-3′. Antiviral Assay—HeLa cells were co-transfected with RNase-L expression constructs, ZC5+ and pZeoHuR or empty vector control. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were reseeded into 96-well plates, and treated with IFNα (PBL Biomedical Laboratories, New Brunswick, NJ) at the indicated concentrations for 16 h, then challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus (multiplicity of infection ∼0.1) for 10 h. Cell viability was analyzed using the MTT assay (Promega, Madison, WI), and the percent protection was calculated using the formula: sample value – virus control (no IFN)/cell control (no virus) – virus control (no IFN). Each value is the mean of 8 identical wells ± S.D. RNase-L mRNA Contains a Long 3′-UTR with Putative AREs—The mature human RNase-L mRNA is 4.3 kb in size, with a coding region of just 2.2 kb and an extensive UTR of ∼2.1 kb (25Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis identified a short, ∼0.37-kb 5′-UTR (27Zhou A. Nie H. Silverman R.H. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 989-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indicating that the remaining 1.75 kb was 3′-UTR. Predicted secondary structures and poly(A) stretches in the 3′-UTR that resulted in RT pausing and oligo(dT) binding upstream of the poly(A) tail, precluded cloning of the 3′-UTR by conventional RT-based approaches. However, analysis of the human genome sequence revealed a predicted poly(A) site, and permitted PCR amplification of the 3′-UTR from genomic DNA to generate a full-length RNase-L cDNA designated ZC5+ (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR using overlapping forward and reverse primer pairs beginning in the coding region and continuing through the 3′-UTR to downstream of the predicted poly(A) site confirmed that the 3′-UTR is contiguous with the coding region, and that the predicted poly(A) site is used (Fig. 1B; NCBI accession code 810337). Specifically, identical PCR products of the expected sizes were generated from ZC5+ and from endogenous RNase-L mRNA when primers upstream of the predicted poly(A) site were used. However, PCR using a reverse primer downstream of the predicted poly(A) site produced a product from the ZC5+ construct that contained this genomic sequence, but not from the untransfected sample that contained only endogenous RNase-L mRNA (Fig. 1B, lane D). This finding is consistent with the use of the predicted poly(A) site by endogenous RNase-L, and indicated that the ZC5+ transcript was using the vector-derived poly(A) signal. Sequence analysis of the 3′-UTR revealed eight putative AREs with canonical AUUUA sequences that may serve as determinants of RNase-L mRNA stability. The extensive nature of the RNase-L 3′-UTR, and the presence of candidate AREs suggested that it may serve an important regulatory function. Cis-acting regulatory elements are predicted to be evolutionarily conserved, therefore we compared the RNase-L 3′-UTR sequence in human and mouse. The mouse RNase-L mRNA contained a 3′-UTR of 1774 bases from the stop codon to the predicted polyadenylation site, which is slightly longer than the 1736-base human sequence. Clustal W alignment of the mouse and human 3′-UTR revealed a modest sequence similarity across the entire 3′-UTR (57% identity); however, islands of high conservation that approach the 74% identity observed in the coding region, were also detected (28Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar). In particular, a 3′-terminal region of 305 bases exhibited a striking 71% sequence identity between mouse and human, and contained two putative ARE elements in a uridine-rich (35% U) context that characterizes functional AREs. These findings identify a conserved 3′-UTR in the RNase-L mRNA that contains ARE elements and may function in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNase-L expression. The 3′-UTR Is a Negative Regulator of RNase-L Expression and mRNA Stability—The presence of a long 3′-UTR is frequently indicative of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via modulation of mRNA stability; therefore, we investigated if the RNase-L 3′-UTR modulated its expression. Transfection of 2fTGH human fibrosarcoma cells with an expression construct containing the RNase-L coding region and 200 bases of 3′-UTR (designated ZC5) resulted in a robust expression of RNase-L protein (Fig. 2A); a comparable strong expression was observed with a coding region construct, demonstrating the lack of regulatory elements in the 5′-most 200 bases of the 3′-UTR (not shown). In contrast, RNase-L expression was dramatically reduced following transfection with the full-length RNase-L ZC5+ construct that contained the 3′-UTR (Fig. 2A). This construct contained poly(A) signals from the RNase-L sequence and from the vector; however, the presence of an extra poly(A) signal did not alter RNase-L expr"

In the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, only two genes, rib-1 and rib-2, homologous to the mammalian EXT genes have been identified. Although rib-2 encodes an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase involved in initiating the biosynthesis and elongation of heparan sulfate, the involvement of the protein encoded by rib-1 in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate remains unclear. Here we report that RIB-1 is indispensable for the biosynthesis and for embryonic morphogenesis. Despite little individual glycosyltransferase activity by RIB-1, the polymerization of heparan sulfate chains was demonstrated when RIB-1 was coexpressed with RIB-2 in vitro. In addition, RIB-1 and RIB-2 were demonstrated to interact by pulldown assays. To investigate the functions of RIB-1 in vivo, we depleted the expression of rib-1 by deletion mutagenesis. The null mutant worms showed reduced synthesis of heparan sulfate and embryonic lethality. Notably, the null mutant embryos showed abnormality at the gastrulation cleft formation stage or later and arrested mainly at the 1-fold stage. Nearly 100% of the embryos died before L1 stage, although the differentiation of some of the neurons and muscle cells proceeded normally. Similar phenotypes have been observed in rib-2 null mutant embryos. Thus, RIB-1 in addition to RIB-2 is indispensable for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate in C. elegans, and the two cooperate to synthesize heparan sulfate in vivo. These findings also show that heparan sulfate is essential for post-gastrulation morphogenic movement of embryonic cells and is indispensable for ensuring the normal spatial organization of differentiated tissues and organs.

The biosynthesis of HS chains, which governs the expression of these functions, is initiated by the construction of a tetrasaccharide linkage region (GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-), which is assembled by the stepwise transfer of monosaccharides from respective UDP-sugars to a Ser residue of the core proteins and/or the naked nonreducing terminus through the actions of the respective specific glycosyltransferases. Next, chain elongation, which results in the formation of the repeating disaccharide region of HS, occurs with GlcNAc and GlcUA transferred alternately by the actions of HS copolymerases. Finally, HS chains are modified by GlcNAc N-deacetylase, GlcUA epimerase, and sulfotransferases (for reviews see Refs. 3Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Biochemical and immunohistochemical studies in Drosophila have revealed that HS levels are dramatically reduced in the absence of ttv, sotv, or botv (21Takei Y. Ozawa Y. Sato M. Watanabe A. Tabata T.

We recently demonstrated in vitro that the polymerization is performed by a complex of TTV and SOTV (TTV-SOTV) as an enzyme source (25Izumikawa T. Egusa N. Taniguchi F. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, TTV-SOTV exhibited no GlcNAc transferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) activity required for the initiation of HS, indicating that BOTV, which corresponds to human EXTL3 and possesses GlcNAcT-I activity (24Kim B.T.

Thus, all three EXT members in Drosophila, TTV, SOTV, and BOTV, are required for the biosynthesis of a full-length HS. In C. elegans, rib-1 and rib-2 are most homologous to EXT1 and EXTL3, respectively, among the human EXT genes (26Clines G.A. Ashley J.A. Shah S. Lovett M. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). rib-2 mutants exhibit developmental delay and egg-laying defects, which are most likely caused by a reduction in HS (28Morio H. Honda Y. Toyoda H. Nakajima M. Kurosawa H. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although rib-2 encodes a GlcNAc transferase involved in initiating the biosynthesis of HS and in the elongation of HS chains (27Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the involvement of the protein encoded by rib-1 in HS biosynthesis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the polymerization of HS using recombinant soluble forms of RIB-1 and RIB-2 to elucidate the mechanism behind the biosynthesis of HS in C. elegans, and we demonstrated that the polymerization was performed by a complex of RIB-1 and RIB-2 as an enzyme source. In addition, to investigate functions of RIB-1 in vivo, we depleted the expression of rib-1 by deletion mutagenesis. Here we demonstrate that in addition to rib-2, rib-1 is indispensable for the biosynthesis of HS and embryonic morphogenesis in C. elegans. Strains—Wild type N2 strain and NW1229 strain (evIs 111 (F25B3.3::GFP; dpy-20 (e1362)), a pan-neuronal strain) were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC, Minneapolis, MN). The deletion mutant strains tm516 and tm710 were isolated from pools of worms mutagenized by a combination of treatment with the chemical mutagen trimethylpsoralen and UV light, and they were identified by detecting polymorphisms in the length of the PCR product, as described previously (29Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The primers used for the screening and genotyping of the deletion alleles were as follows: For tm516, ExtRev, 5′-AAGAATCCATGAGTCGGAGA-3′, ExtFwd, 5′-TTCCACTGGACCTCTCCCAT-3′, IntFwd, 5′-CCCATCTTCTCGTACATCTT-3′, and IntRev, 5′-GATGACAACAGGAACACATC-3′; and for tm710, IntRev, 5′-CGAGTAAATGTCGATCCGCT-3′, ExtRev, 5′-GGCTAGCAAACTCCTCGCGA-3′, ExtFwd, 5′-TTGGGACGAGAATGACTCAT-3′, and IntFwd, 5′-CATTTGCCGCGGAATTGGTT-3′. Because both mutants showed lethal or sterile phenotypes, they were outcrossed four times and balanced with dpy20(e1415) for tm516 and with unc-119(ed3) for tm710. Single Worm PCR—Single animals were picked up with a platinum wire and placed individually in a 10-μl drop of lysis buffer (500 μg/ml proteinase K in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 mm EDTA) in a 200-μl PCR tube. The drops were spun down to the bottom of the tube by brief centrifugation, frozen (-80 °C, 10 min), and heated (50 °C, 30 min followed by 95 °C, 20 min). After cooling to room temperature, 1-2 μl of the drops was used as a template for single worm PCR for the tm516 and tm710 deletion alleles with the primers described above. Materials—UDP-[U-14C]GlcUA (285.2 mCi/mmol) and UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (60 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc were obtained from Sigma.

In the case of RIB-2, the cDNA fragment encoding a truncated form of RIB-2, lacking the first amino-terminal 38 amino acids of RIB-2 (AB077851), was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR with adult C. elegans total RNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCTCCTTCTCCGAGCCTTCCTG-3′) containing a BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCGTAGCACCATTCGA-3′) containing a BamHI site located 68 bp downstream of the stop codon. PCR was carried out with KOD polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) for 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 180 s in 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. The PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGIR201protA (31Kitagawa H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1394-1401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the fusion of the insulin signal sequence and the protein A sequence present in the vector as described previously (25Izumikawa T. Egusa N. Taniguchi F. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified cDNA was determined in a 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression of Soluble Forms of RIB-1 and RIB-2 and Enzyme Assays—The expression plasmid (6.0 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For cotransfection experiments, the RIB-1 and RIB-2 expression plasmids (3.0 μg each) (27Kitagawa H. Egusa N. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4834-4838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were cotransfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 as above. After a 2-day culture at 30 °C, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed with and then resuspended in each of the assay buffers described below, and tested for GlcNAcT-II transferase activity using 10 μg of N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, GlcUAβ1-[4GlcNAcα1-4GlcUAβ-]n, and for GlcAT-II activity using 10 μg of GlcNAcα1-[4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-]n as an acceptor, respectively, as described previously (25Izumikawa T. Egusa N. Taniguchi F. Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1929-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The assay mixture for GlcNAcT contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, an acceptor substrate, 0.25 mm UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (8.21 × 105 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 20 μl. The assay mixture for GlcAT-II activity contained 10 μl of the resuspended beads, an acceptor substrate, 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (5.66 × 105 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, and 10 mm MnCl2 in a total volume of 20 μl. A polymerization reaction using 10 μg of N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, GlcNAcα1-[4GlcUAβ1-4GlcNAcα1-]n, as an acceptor was conducted in incubation mixtures containing, in a total volume of 20 μl, 0.25 mm UDP-GlcNAc, 0.25 mm UDP-[14C]GlcUA (1.35 × 106 dpm), 100 mm MES buffer, pH 5.8, 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μl of suspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 26 °C overnight, and then radiolabeled products were separated from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc or UDP-[14C]GlcUA by gel filtration chromatography on a column of Superdex™ 75 equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NH4HCO3. Fractions (0.4 ml each) were collected at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and the measurement of radioactivity was carried out by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blot Analysis—After 3 days of culture at 28 °C, the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and incubated for 1 h with mouse IgG antibody. The mouse IgG antibody was diluted 1:1,000 with 25 mm Tris-buffered saline. The bound antibody was detected with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to the antibody were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) advance kit (GE Healthcare). Characterization of the Reaction Products—Products of polymerization reactions on N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides, GlcUAβ1-[4GlcNAcα1-4GlcUAβ-]n, or GlcUAβ1-3Galβ1-O-C2H4NHCbz were isolated by gel filtration on a column of Superdex™ 75 or Superdex™ Peptide, respectively, with 0.2 m NH4HCO3 as the eluent. The radioactive peak containing the cotransfection reaction product was pooled and evaporated dry. The [14C]GlcUA-labeled oligosaccharide chains were exhaustively digested with 3 mIU of heparitinase I in a total volume of 20 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm calcium acetate at 37 °C overnight. The enzyme digest was analyzed using the same Superdex™ 75 or Superdex™ Peptide column as described above. Analysis of Glycosaminoglycans—Freshly cultured nematodes were sonicated with a GE-70 ultrasonic processor (Branson Ultrasonics) and freeze-dried. The dried samples (295.2 mg of wild type or 386.3 mg of mutant nematode) were extracted with acetone and then treated with 6 ml of 1.0 m NaBH4, 0.05 m NaOH at 4 °C for 20 h. The reaction mixture was neutralized with acetic acid to stop the reaction. The samples were adjusted to 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged. The soluble fraction was extracted with ether. As shown previously (15Yamada S. Van Die I. Van den Eijnden D.H. Yokota A. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Mizuguchi S. Uyama T.

The aqueous phase was adjusted to 80% ethanol. The resultant precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm pyridine acetate and subjected to gel filtration on a PD-10 column using 50 mm pyridine acetate as an eluent. The flow-through fraction was collected and evaporated dry. The dried samples were dissolved in water and applied to a column (7 ml) of cation-exchange resin AG 50W-X2 (H+ form; Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with water. The unbound fraction containing the liberated O-linked saccharides was neutralized with 1 m NH4HCO3. The purified glycosaminoglycan fraction was digested with chondroitinase ABC or a mixture of heparitinases I and II, and then the digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (34Kinoshita A. Sugahara K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Pulldown Assays—The cDNA fragment of a truncated form of RIB-2, lacking the first 38 amino-terminal amino acids of RIB-2, was amplified using a 5′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCCTCCTTCTCCGAGCCTTCC-3′) containing an in-frame BamHI site and a 3′-primer (5′-CGGGATCCGTAGCACCATTCGA-3′) containing a BamHI site located 68 bp downstream of the stop codon. The DNA fragment was inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3Ins-His, resulting in the fusion of the protein with the insulin signal sequence and His6 sequence present in the vector. The rib-2 construct and the protein A-tagged RIB-1 expression vector were introduced into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days after the cotransfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) overnight at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with Tris-buffered saline buffer containing Tween 20 three times and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7% gel), and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane, after blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20, was incubated with IgG antibody and then treated with anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Proteins bound to the antibody were visualized with an ECL advance kit (GE Healthcare). Transgenic Construct—The tph-1 (ZK1290.2) reporter gene plasmid was constructed using the vector pFX_DsRedXT (33Izumikawa T. Kitagawa H. Mizuguchi S. Nomura K.H. Nomura K. Tamura J. Gengyo-Ando K.

Biochem. 1999; 269: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The translational fusion construct contained a 3.7-kb genomic fragment, including the 3.1-kb potential promoter region. The fragment was amplified with C. elegans genomic DNA as a template using a 5′-primer (5′-GAGTGCAAGACTATTAGGGAGT-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-AGTACGAGTTGGTGTGAAGAG-3′) located at the start of the 3rd exon. PCR was carried out with Platinum TaqDNA polymerase high fidelity (Invitrogen) for 28 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 240 s followed by adenine addition with Taq polymerase at 72 °C for 15 min. The PCR fragment was inserted into pFX_ DsRedXT using the TA cloning strategy to fuse the coding sequence region of DsRed. Phenotypic Analysis—We determined the embryonic phenotypes and extent of lethality of the rib-1/rib-2 mutant worms by monitoring embryonic development with four-dimensional microscopy (a DMRXA full automatic microscope with differential interference contrast and fluorescence optics; Leica) (32Mizuguchi S.

A total of 92 rib-1-/- worms was monitored from the start of gastrulation until they had reached a terminal phenotype and scored. Phenotypes were also monitored and scored by using a high resolution dissecting microscope (Olympus SZX12) as described previously (36Dejima K. Seko A. Yamashita K. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S.

Transgenic Rescue Experiment—To rescue the rib-1 deletion mutant tm516, a transgenic rescue construct was created using the C. elegans expression vector (pFX_LVT-R03G5.1) constructed from PFX_venusT cloning vector (35Gengyo-Ando K. Yoshina S. Inoue H. Mitani S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 349: 1345-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), in which eft-4 (R03G5.1; elongation factor-1 α) promoter (3,616 bp from X:7820004 to X:7823619) was inserted into the XcmI site in the multicloning site, which is located upstream of the venus open reading frame. The rib-1 cDNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) from the total RNA prepared from mixed stage worms (36Dejima K. Seko A. Yamashita K. Gengyo-Ando K.

https://openalex.org/W2026837912,"DNA damage that eludes cellular repair pathways can arrest the replication machinery and stall the cell cycle. However, this damage can be bypassed by the Y-family DNA polymerases. Here, Dpo4, an archetypal Y-family member from the thermophilic Sulfolobus solfataricus, was used to extend our kinetic studies of the bypass of an abasic site, one of the most mutagenic and ubiquitous cellular lesions. A short oligonucleotide sequencing assay is developed to directly sequence DNA bypass products synthesized by Dpo4. Our results show that incorporation upstream of the abasic lesion is replicated error-free; yet dramatically, once Dpo4 encounters the lesion, synthesis became sloppy, with bypass products containing a myriad of mutagenic events. Incorporation of dAMP (29%) and dCMP (53%) opposite the abasic lesion at 37 °C correlates exceptionally well with our kinetic results and demonstrates two dominant bypass pathways via the A-rule and the lesion loop-out mechanism. Interestingly, the percentage of overall frameshift mutations increased from 71 (37 °C) to 87% (75 °C). Further analysis indicates that lesion bypass via the A-rule is strongly preferred over the lesion loop-out mechanism at higher temperatures and concomitantly reduces the occurrence of “-1 deletion” mutations observed opposite the lesion at lower temperatures. The bypass percentage via the latter pathway is confirmed by an enzymatic digestion assay, verifying the reliability of our sequencing assay. Our results demonstrate that an abasic lesion causes Dpo4 and possibly all Y-family members to switch from a normal to a very mutagenic mode of replication.

Cellular DNA is continually damaged by agents both endogenous and exogenous to an organism. This damage structurally modifies DNA, arresting replication by stalling the replicative DNA polymerase. The inability to copy the genome leads to cell cycle stalling and possibly cell death. Although a large portion of DNA lesions is restored by cellular repair pathways, a biologically significant amount of damage persists. Fortunately, organisms have evolved specialized enzymes known as the Y-family DNA polymerases that are capable of replicating damaged DNA in either an error-free or error-prone fashion (1Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W. Livneh Z. Nohmi T. Prakash L. Prakash S. Todo T. Walker G.C. Wang Z. Woodgate R. Mol.

Although the Y-family DNA polymerases collectively synthesize one to a few nucleotides per binding event, they all lack proofreading exonuclease activity and generate up to 100,000-fold more errors on undamaged DNA when compared with the astonishingly accurate replicative DNA polymerases (1Ohmori H.

These more permissive active sites impart unique functional attributes to the Y-family, including the ability to replicate through aberrant and bulky DNA lesions, which is conferred by the limited contacts between the Y-family polymerase active site residues and DNA. Among DNA damage, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are one of the most common lesions in mammalian cells (11Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) with a steady state frequency approaching 50,000 sites per genome (12Nakamura J. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2522-2526PubMed Google Scholar). These noncoding lesions are generated enzymatically, via spontaneous hydrolysis, or by more complex mechanisms involving free radicals or alkylating agents (13Lindahl T. Andersson A. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3618-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 14Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4377) Google Scholar). Because S. solfataricus grows at 75–85 °C, it is reasonable to expect more genomic AP sites compared with the relative amount present in humans and other mesophilic systems. Although replicative polymerases like S. solfataricus pol B1 lack the ability to bypass AP sites (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), they can inefficiently incorporate dATP opposite the lesion in a phenomenon known as the “A-rule” (15Strauss B. Rabkin S. Sagher D. Moore P. Biochimie (Paris). 1982; 64: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, due to the large number of AP sites and the fact that Dpo4 is the only known Y-family polymerase in S. solfataricus, Dpo4 is an excellent model for mechanistic and structural studies of AP bypass. In our accompanying article (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we show that during efficient bypass, Dpo4 paused when incorporating nucleotides directly opposite and one position downstream from an AP lesion due to a decrease in catalytic efficiency. In addition, incorporation opposite the lesion partitioned primarily between two distinct pathways, one involving the A-rule (Scheme 1A) and the second involving the novel lesion loop-out mechanism (Scheme 1B). This latter mechanism involved incorporation directed by the template base 5′ to the AP lesion via an extrahelical AP site that was extended in-frame without primer/template realignment generating a “-1 frameshift.” However, these kinetic predictions need to be verified by actual DNA sequence data. In addition, kinetic analysis cannot capture infrequent mutation events and thus cannot provide a complete picture of the mutagenic spectrum, especially downstream from the abasic lesion. Here we determined the precise sequences of short DNA products synthesized by Dpo4 during AP lesion bypass in vitro, using a novel short oligonucleotide sequencing assay. These sequences will reveal the mutagenic impact of AP lesion bypass by the Y-family. Materials—Human AP endonuclease and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Trevigen and Invitrogen, respectively. Dpo4 was expressed and purified as described previously (16Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotides listed in Table 1 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and were purified, labeled, and annealed as described previously (17Fiala K.A. Abdel-Gawad W. Suo Z.

Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2106-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Short Oligonucleotide Sequencing Assay—Dpo4 (120 nm) was incubated with 17-mer/41-AP (30 nm, see Table 1) and mixed with four dNTPs (200 μm each) for 3 h, which was sufficient to generate full-length “AP bypass product.” Dpo4 was then extracted three times with buffer-saturated phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1), and the remaining DNA substrates were incubated with human AP endonuclease (50 units; Trevigen) to cleave the DNA template 41AP. The full-length AP bypass product synthesized by Dpo4 was then purified from the pool of DNA complexes via 20% denaturing PAGE to separate the AP bypass product from cleaved template 41AP, followed by gel extraction and reverse-phase C18 column chromatography. The resulting purified AP bypass product was then PCR-amplified using the following primers: 17-mer_AP_sequencing_forward, 5′-CGCAGCCGTCCAACCAA-3′, and 15-mer_AP_sequencing_reverse, 5′-GGACGGCATTGGATC-3′, which were designed to provide sequence information for four nucleotides both upstream and downstream from the AP site in addition to events that score an incorporation directly opposite the lesion. Based on our results, the spectrum of mutations was essentially always resolved within this sequence window; however, there remains a small possibility that some bypass products contained additional mutations outside this window. The amplified AP bypass product was then ligated into a pCRII-TOPO vector using a TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) followed by transformation into TOP10 Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen). Plasmid was isolated from 55 independent colonies using a miniprep kit (Promega) and were then sequenced using an automated 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). The method was summarized in Scheme 2. Controls for human AP endonuclease show its ability to completely digest DNA containing either intrahelical or extrahelical AP sites, and showing no degradation of an undamaged DNA control (data not shown). BmgBI Digestion Assay—A preincubated solution of Dpo4 (120 nm) and 5′-radiolabeled 17-mer/41AP (30 nm; Table 1) was mixed with four dNTPs (200 μm each) to generate a full-length AP bypass product at 37 °C. The full-length AP bypass product was purified from Dpo4 and the template 41AP via phenol/chloroform extraction, human AP endonuclease treatment, denaturing PAGE, and C18 column chromatography as described above. The pool of purified AP bypass product was annealed to 40Te (Table 1) in molar excess containing half of the BmgBI restriction site, in 1× NEB Buffer, and then overdigested with BmgBI (20 units; New England Biolabs) for 3 h at 37 °C. Digestion reactions were then heated to 65 °C for 30 min to thermally denature BmgBI and subsequently run on a 20% native polyacrylamide gel for 2 h to resolve digested product from full-length duplex DNA. The percent digestion was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Reactions at 75 °C were performed in Buffer R with potassium phosphate instead of HEPES. Our previous kinetic results (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) reveal numerous branched pathways used by Dpo4 to bypass an AP lesion. Although elucidating the kinetics of each branched pathway would be extremely tedious, various aspects of these kinetic assays require careful consideration. While these pre-steady state kinetic methods are mechanistically informative and provide a relative measure of polymerization fidelity, they cannot generate DNA sequence information or the mutation profile. The most common kinetic assay for fidelity determination involves measuring and comparing the incorporation preference of each individual deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) into a DNA substrate via single nucleotide incorporation assays under either steady state or pre-steady state reaction conditions. Since the selection of dNTPs at the polymerase active site for incorporation opposite a specific canonical template base forms a correct or an incorrect Watson-Crick base pair, polymerase fidelity can be calculated under the assumption that there will be exactly one nucleotide incorporated opposite each template base. Although almost exclusively true for a replicative polymerase that replicates undamaged DNA with high fidelity, bypass of a DNA lesion by Dpo4, a low fidelity enzyme, has been shown by us here and others previously (18Kokoska R.J.

A. 2004; 101: 2265-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to generate a variety of deletion and addition mutations in the vicinity of the lesion, indicating an equilibrium between several conformationally distinct DNA species exploited for bypass. This equilibrium is particularly relevant at structurally flexible AP sites (23Gelfand C.A. Plum G.E. Grollman A.P. Johnson F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7321-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Wang K.Y. Parker S.A. Goljer I. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and thus invalidates the assumption of “one dNTP for each template base” for lesion bypass. As such, the definition of fidelity, although suitable for studies with undamaged DNA, cannot be strictly applied to these incorporation events. Furthermore, these single nucleotide incorporation assays are subject to pyrophosphorolysis, the reverse of forward synthesis, if the incoming dNTP does not form a correct base pair with the downstream template base after the first incorporation event. Dpo4 has been shown to have somewhat robust pyrophosphorolysis activity that is notably attenuated when an incorrect incorporation event can be extended by correct nucleotide incorporation (25Vaisman A. Ling H. Woodgate R. Yang W. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2957-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus the kinetic results of lesion bypass from single nucleotide incorporation assays may not accurately reflect all actual bypass events, especially those through noncanonical pathways (see below), and requires cautious interpretation. To extend our previous kinetic studies (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and provide a complete mutagenic spectrum, we designed an assay for sequencing short DNA products synthesized by Dpo4 during AP lesion bypass to elucidate the entire mutation profile. Development of a Novel Assay for Sequencing Short DNA Products—Traditional strategies for sequencing short DNA products include the Maxam-Gilbert method and the Sanger method. However, both of these methods are limited by the inability to resolve sequence information from a DNA mixture of variable lengths and sequences (20Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because our previous kinetic results (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) indicated Dpo4 generated a population of bypass products, these techniques could not be used. Although the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry technique used by Zang et al. (20Zang H. Goodenough A.K. Choi J.Y. Irimia A. Loukachevitch L.V. Kozekov I.D. Angel K.C. Rizzo C.J. Egli M. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29750-29764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) is fundamentally better than the aforementioned methods, it still only provides a semi-quantitative analysis of a population of DNA substrates and disregards the sequence contexts of minor species. In addition, the modified reversion assay used by Kokoska et al. (18Kokoska R.J. McCulloch S.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50537-50545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although elegant, only detects roughly 60% of single base errors made during in vitro lesion bypass. This is because of the lack of a completely ligated plasmid prior to transformation into E. coli. In addition, the assay itself is less likely to observe minor species because it lacks DNA product amplification before plasmid assembly. Because of the shortcomings of these assays, we developed a short oligonucleotide sequencing assay (SOSA) integrating PCR amplification and an efficient cloning technique to unambiguously determine the sequence of a population of short DNA bypass products synthesized by Dpo4 in the exact sequence context used in our previous kinetic analysis (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA Products Using SOSA at 37 °C—We exploited this novel assay to determine the mutation profile for the bypass of an AP site by Dpo4 using a 17-mer/41AP (Table 1) that contained a template guanine 5′ to the lesion. Ultimately, the method (Scheme 2) was designed to isolate and ligate the AP bypass products synthesized by Dpo4 into a vector for automated sequence analysis. Analysis of the DNA sequences from 55 independent colonies is summarized in Fig. 1A. The results of the assay performed at 37 °C revealed that upstream from the AP site all incorporation events catalyzed by Dpo4 was sequence-dependent, and all incorporation events (220 nucleotides) were replicated error-free and in-frame. Strikingly, once Dpo4 encountered the lesion, a spectrum of mutagenic bypass events was generated. Interestingly, 13% of the time (7/55 colonies) Dpo4 synthesized a full-length (41-mer) AP bypass product lacking any downstream mutations with dAMP located opposite the AP site (Fig. 1A). Other AP bypass products contained only single/double base substitutions (9%, 5/55 colonies), only single/multiple base deletions (56%, 31/55 colonies), only base additions (2%, 1/55 colonies), or complex transactions involving a combination of deletion(s), addition(s), and substitution(s) (13%, 7/55 colonies). The remaining 7% (4/55 colonies) of AP bypass products were full-length and in-frame but had dCMP, dGMP, or dTMP inserted opposite the AP site (Fig. 1A). Although our results demonstrated the ability to incorporate all nucleotides directly opposite the lesion, 82% of the time (45/55 colonies) Dpo4 incorporated either dAMP (via A-rule) or dCMP (mostly via the lesion loop-out mechanism) coinciding with our previous kinetic results (42Fiala K.A. Hypes C.D. Suo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 8188-8198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showing that 90% of AP lesion bypass events occurred via these two pathways. Yet this initial partitioning opposite the lesion did not represent the full extent of mutagenic bypass of the AP bypass. Our results showed 21 unique sequence contexts revealing that unregulated bypass of the lesion by Dpo4 was extremely sloppy. The most logical mechanisms for each of these 21 DNA sequences were diagrammed in supplemental Schemes 4–7and were based on previous structural studies of Dpo4. Roughly 52% (30/55 colonies) of these AP bypass products were characterized by either dAMP incorporation opposite the AP site (A-rule) lacking downstream mutations or a -1 deletion mechanism due to incorporation via the lesion loop-out mechanism (see above). The proposed mechanism for the former, as illustrated in supplemental Scheme 4B, was supported by two crystal structures from Ling et al. (19Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) of Dpo4 with a DNA substrate containing an AP site. The first crystal structure (structure Ab-4A) provides partial evidence for dAMP incorporation by Dpo4 opposite the lesion in an intrahelical fashion, whereas crystal structure Ab-3 shows Dpo4 adopts a conformation allowing in-frame extension from this incorporation event generating the observed full-length product. The latter mechanism for the generation of the frameshift mutation via the lesion loop-out mechanism (supplemental Scheme 5E) was derived directly from two different structures in the same report. Structure Ab-1, which has the AP site at the first “templating” position, demonstrates that in the presence of an incoming nucleotide that can form a Watson-Crick base pair with the template base 5′ to the AP site, Dpo4 can accommodate an extrahelical AP site in the gap between its finger and little finger domains, shifting the template base 5′ to the lesion into the active site to direct nucleotide incorporation. The second structure, Ab-2A, captures the ability of Dpo4 to extend from this incorporation event retaining the extrahelical AP lesion (19Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The remaining 19 AP bypass products were each observed only 2–4% of the time and contain primarily deletion and substitution mutations. For example, the bypass event in supplemental Scheme 4A occurred via incorporation of dAMP opposite the lesion followed by a substitution mutation that proceeded either by a simple mismatch incorporation of dTMP opposite the downstream 5′ template guanine or via a mechanism reminiscent of the type II Dpo4 structure reported with undamaged DNA, where the incoming dTTP instead base pairs with the downstream template adenine (9Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), similar to that observed in the Ab-2B structure (19Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Other proposed mechanisms involved more complicated DNA structural rearrangements as in supplemental Scheme 4F where, after dAMP incorporation opposite the AP site, the proposed pathway splits into two subpathways involving the following: (i) either a type II-like intermediate followed by a subsequent two-nucleotide loop-out in the template strand to generate the double deletion, or (ii) an intermediate involving an extrahelical base in the primer similar to what was observed in Ab-4B (19Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) followed by extension and rearrangement of the primer-template to generate the “-2 deletion.” Importantly, although the assay temperature is not physiologically relevant for Dpo4, it is relevant for other mesophilic Y-family DNA polymerases, especially those from the DinB subfamily (i.e. human pol κ and E. coli DNA polymerase IV) which, like Dpo4, have all been shown to generate -1 deletions even on undamaged DNA (26Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol.

Analysis of AP Bypass Products at 75 °C—The same assay was performed at 75 °C, the in vivo temperature for S. solfataricus, to determine the effect of temperature on the mutation profile for AP lesion bypass catalyzed by Dpo4. This assay was buffered with 50 mm potassium phosphate instead of 50 mm HEPES because of the pH stability of this buffer over a range of temperatures, although all other components in Buffer R (see “Experimental Procedures”) remained unchanged. Notably, the change in buffer conditions did not affect the burst kinetics reported previously (data not shown (29Fiala K.A. Suo Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2116-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar)). To prevent the melting of the 17-mer/41AP duplex at 75 °C prior to polymerization, the DNA substrate was preincubated with Dpo4 at room temperature for 10 min prior to incubation at 75 °C such that Dpo4 binding would stabilize the DNA duplex. For the reaction at 75 °C, we were able to extract sequencing information from 45 individual colonies using SOSA (Fig. 1B). Again, as observed at 37 °C, the results showed all four incorporations upstream of the AP site were replicated faithfully and lacked a single mutation (180 total incorporation events). However, once Dpo4 encountered the AP lesion, it generated a myriad of frameshift and substitution mutations resulting in 16 distinct AP bypass products. The corresponding pathways were not illustrated as were those at 37 °C because of their modest redundancy. Yet the precise mutational spectrum differed from that observed at 37 °C. While at 37 °C, 13% of the AP bypass products were inframe with dAMP located opposite the AP site (Fig. 1A), and we similarly found 11% (5/45 colonies) had this sequence context at 75 °C (Fig. 1B). Likewise, at both 37 and 75 °C there were very few AP bypass products that contained only base additions (2% at 37 °C and none at 75 °C). However, at 75 °C, 80% (36/45 colonies) contained only single/multiple base deletions (versus 56% at 37 °C); 7% (3/45 colonies) were complex transactions (versus 13% at 37 °C), and only 2% (1/45 colonies) had base substitutions (versus 9% at 37 °C). Thus, at higher temperature, Dpo4 generated more deletion mutations at the expense of a similar magnitude decrease in complex mutations, base substitutions, and in-frame incorporations with dCMP, dGMP, or dTMP opposite the AP site (Table 2). In addition, regardless of specific mutations, the percentage of overall frameshift mutations (both addition and deletion mutations) increased from 71% (39/55 colonies) at 37 °C to 87% (39/45 col"

The c-Myc transcription factor plays an important role in the regulation of the cell cycle, cellular transformation, and apoptosis (1Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) as well as in the genesis of many human cancers (2Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). The deregulation of MYC expression by chromosomal translocation, amplification, or altered signal transduction is commonly found in human cancers (3Escot C. Theillet C. Lidereau R. Spyratos F.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which c-Myc contributes to tumorigenesis, several approaches have been used to identify its target genes, which are compiled in the data base myccancergene.org.Rcl was identified as a c-Myc target by representational difference analysis between non-adherent Rat1a fibroblasts and Rat 1a cells transformed by MYC (5Lewis B.C.

Moreover, Rcl is one of the most responsive targets to Myc activation in vitro and in Myc-induced transgenic lymphoma (6Kim S.Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A. Salghetti S.E. Tansey W.P. Mol.

O'Donnell K.A. Dang C.V. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serial analysis of gene expression studies revealed that Rcl is also highly expressed in human glioblastoma multiforme as compared with normal human brain (information from the UniGene data base, at NCBI). Furthermore, Rcl is among the top 50 genes whose overexpression distinguishes between benign and malignant prostate tissues (9Rhodes D.R. Barrette T.R. Rubin M.A. Ghosh D. Chinnaiyan A.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4427-4433PubMed Google Scholar). Functionally, Rcl has transforming activity in Rat1a cells when coexpressed with either vascular endothelial growth factor or lactate dehydrogenase (10Lewis B.C. Prescott J.E. Campbell S.E. Shim H.

Altogether, these data suggest that RCL could be a prime therapeutic target.RCL appears to be a nuclear 22-kDa protein with yet unknown function. The closest relatives of RCL protein are members of the nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase family (EC 2.4.2.6). (pfam 05014), which catalyze the reversible transfer of the deoxyribosyl moiety from a deoxynucleoside donor to an acceptor nucleobase (11Macnutt W.S. Biochem.

RCL is a deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate N-glycosidase, an enzyme never described before. Its putative role in the mammalian nucleotide metabolism and tumorigenesis is also discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—Ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives of adenine, cytosine, guanine, hypoxanthine, thymine, and uracil were from Sigma-Aldrich. 6-Methylthio-guanosine 5′-monophosphate, 2′-deoxyguanosine 3′-monophosphate, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate were from Jena Bioscience.Overexpression and Purification of RCL and of the N-terminal His-tagged RCL—The Rcl cDNA cloned into pCR2.1 as a NcoI-BamHI fragment was subcloned into pET24d digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting pET24dRcl was used to transform strain Bli5 (BL21 (DE3) pDIA17). One liter of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml of chloram-phenicol and kanamycin was inoculated with an overnight culture of Bli5 containing pET24dRcl. The culture was grown under agitation at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm and the cultures further incubated for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and the pellet frozen at -20 °C. The cells were resuspended in 35 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and broken by two passages through a French press at 14,000 pounds/square inch. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a Q-fast flow column previously equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 0–40% NaCl gradient. RCL was eluted between 20 and 25% NaCl, and the corresponding fractions were pooled and precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate. Pelleted RCL was resuspended in Tris 50 mm, pH 7.5, and further purified by filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The elution was followed by UV absorption at 280 nm, and each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and N-glycosidase activity. The purest and most active fractions were concentrated on an Omega cell with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff membrane (Pall Life Sciences) and stored at -20 °C.The N-terminal His-tagged RCL was overproduced and purified as follows. The Rcl gene cloned into pCR2.1 as a NdeI-BamHI fragment was subcloned into pET28a digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting pET28aRcl was used to transform strain Bli5. Culture conditions and induction were performed as described above. Frozen cells resuspended in 40 ml of extraction/wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl pH 7.0) were broken by two passages through a French press at 14,000 pounds/square inch. The lysate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded on a column containing 6 ml of TALON resin (BD Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the same buffer. After washing, RCL was eluted with 150 mm imidazole. Fractions containing RCL were pooled and concentrated on an Omega cell 10 K membrane (Pall). The His-tagged RCL was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column. The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and by measuring the specific activity. Purified His-tagged RCL was stored at -20 °C.RCL with Glu-105 Replaced by Ala (E105A Mutant) by Site-directed Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotides T7prom (5′-CGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGG-3′) and olinvE105A (5′-GCCCGGCCCAGCGCATAGCCAACACCCAAG-3′), T7term (5′-GGGGTTATGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′) and olE105A (5′-CTTGGGTGTTGGCTATGCGCTGGGCCGGGC-3′) were used in two separate PCRs with plasmid pET28aRcl as the DNA template. The parameters used were 1 cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 51.5 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72 °C. An aliquot (1/100 of the reaction) of each PCR was used as the DNA template in a third PCR with oligonucleotides T7prom and T7term. The parameters used were the same as described above. The PCR product was purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and then digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes over 2 h at 37 °C and repurified. Each PCR product was ligated with plasmid pET28a digested with the same restriction enzymes. The ligation mixtures were used to transform strain DH5α. Plasmids with the correct sequence, pET28aRclE105A, were used to transform strain Bli5.Enzyme Activity Assays—The enzyme activity was determined either spectrophotometrically by following one of the reaction products, hypoxanthine or deoxyribose 5-phosphate, or by HPLC 3The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; COG, clustering of orthologous groups. separation and UV detection of the released nucleobase and the remaining substrate.dIMP was used as a substrate, and the hypoxanthine released oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase. The absorption increase at 290 nm was converted in enzymatic units using a millimolar absorbance coefficient of 12.0. One milliliter of the medium reaction thermostated at 37 °C contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dIMP, 0.2 units of xanthine oxidase (Roche Applied Sciences) and 50–200 μg of purified RCL.d-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which is produced by the deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase from deoxyribose 5-phosphate, was coupled to the oxidation of NADH to NAD via the reactions catalyzed by triose phosphate isomerase and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed on a Amersham Biosciences Ultrospec 3100 Pro spectrophotometer using a millimolar absorbance coefficient of 6.22. The reaction medium (1 ml final volume) contained 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.0, 0.1 mm NADH, and 1.5 units each of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase (Roche Applied Sciences), deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase, 4Overproduction and purification of E. coli deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase. and 50–200 μg of purified RCL. One unit of enzyme activity corresponds to 1 μmol of product formed in 1 min at 37 °C and pH 6.0.HPLC assays were as described previously (14Kaminski P.A. J. Biol.

Hydrolase activities (dNMP → N + dR5P) were performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.0, containing 1 mm dNMP and the appropriate amount of purified RCL. The reverse reaction (Gua + dR5P → dGMP) was performed at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 6.0, containing 3 mm guanine, 3 mm deoxyribose 5-phosphate, and 200 μg of purified RCL. Deoxyribose 5-phosphate transferase reactions (dNMP + X → dXMP + N) were performed at 37 °C in Tris acetate, pH 6.0 (or 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, or 50 mm citrate-sodium, pH 6.5), containing 1 mm dCMP or dGMP and 1 mm either adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, uracil, or hypoxanthine and 200 μg of purified RCL.The NdeI-HindIII fragment of pHSP234, which contains the Escherichia coli deoC gene (a kind gift of H. Sakamoto) was cloned into plasmid pET28a digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting plasmid, in strain Bli5, allows the expression of the deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase with an N-terminal His tag. Culture condition, induction, centrifugation, and purification on TALON resin were as described for His-RCL. Fractions containing deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol concentrated in an Omega cell 10 K and kept frozen at -20 °C.Other Analytical Procedures—Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay kit from Bio-Rad.

Mass spectrometry was performed by the PT3 proteomique of the Pasteur Institute as previously described (14Kaminski P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14400-14407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an An-60 Ti four-hole rotor. Samples (150 μl) at three protein concentrations (3, 10, and 30 μm), in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl were run at six speeds (8, 10, 12, 14, 20, and 50 kilorevolutions/min). Five profiles were recorded after reaching equilibrium (12–18 h) at three wavelengths according to sample concentration (291, 280, and 231 nm, respectively). Partial specific volume v-bar of 0.713 ml/g was computed from the amino acid composition; solvent density = 1.004 g/ml and viscosity = 1.03 centipoise were set from tables. Data analysis was performed with the program Origin (Microcal).RESULTSPurification of RCL and Molecular Properties of the Recombinant Proteins—Both RCL and His-RCL were produced as soluble proteins, and their purity was estimated to be >95% by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The molecular mass of RCL and His-RCL, according to appropriate markers (24–26 kDa), is higher than the deduced 18–20-kDa molecular mass. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry of RCL indicated a molecular mass of 17,649.54 ± 0.92 Da and His-RCL of 19,812.06 ± 1.72 Da, which are very close to the sequence-deduced one (17,631.81 and 19,813.15 Da, respectively), with the initiating methionine being deleted. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments showed that, at 3 μm, His-RCL is mostly monomeric (free averaged molecular mass 22,603 Da). At 30 μm, His-RCL is mostly dimeric (free averaged molecular mass 40,522 Da). At 10 μm, His-RCL is at equilibrium between monomeric (20,440 Da) and dimeric (40,880 Da) states (Fig. 2). The dissociation constant (Kd) computed from the best fit with the 30 and the 10 μm data sets was 9.53 μm and 10.40 μm, with a mean value 10 ± 1 μm. No higher molecular mass oligomers were detected, indicating that the quaternary structure of RCL differs from that of N-deoxyribosyltransferase, which is a stable hexamer.FIGURE 2Determination of the molecular mass of His-RCL by analytical ultracentrifugation. Absorbance scans from ultracentrifugation experiments were reported as a function of radius to the rotor center. Only one scan per speed (10, 12, 14, and 20 kilorevolutions/min and per starting RCL concentration (10 μm) was indicated for clarity. The best overall fit over 1706 points (three scans, five speeds) was fitted with the continuous lines corresponding to the monomer-dimer equilibrium with a Kd = 10.40 μm and a variance of 4.76 10-4. Residual values were below 10-2 evenly spread over best fit lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RCL at concentrations >1 mg/ml could be stored at -20 °C for at least 1 year without loss of activity. RCL is a heat-stable protein, as the temperature of half denaturation (Tm) was estimated to be ∼74 °C.The Rationale for Identifying the Catalytic Function of RCL—Examination of the homology of RCL with N-deoxyribosyltransferase from Lactobacilli revealed several interesting features (Fig. 3). Several amino acids that participate in the active site of Lactobacillus leichmannii N-deoxyribosyltransferase are conserved in RCL, such as the Glu-105, which is also involved in a hydrogen bond with the 3′-OH of the sugar of the deoxynucleoside (16Armstrong S.R. Cook W.J. Short S.A. Ealick S.E. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Tyr-2, which stabilizes this bond, as well as Asp-75, involved in the binding of the base, are also conserved. Interestingly, the two amino acids, Asp-99 and Asn-172, involved in the binding of the 5′-OH of the sugar, are not conserved in RCL, being replaced by two Ser residues with smaller size (Fig. 3, inset). We hypothesized that the substrate recognized by RCL should be related to deoxynucleosides (substrate of N-deoxyribosyltransferase) or the corresponding phosphorylated compounds. Consequently, ∼50 ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides, including their mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives, were incubated individually for several hours at 37 °C with pure RCL, and then the reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and later by HPLC (Fig. 4). When RCL was incubated with various deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphates (and to a lesser extent with deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates), a constant reaction product was the corresponding free base. We deduced that RCL catalyzes the following hydrolytic reaction: deoxyribonucleoside 5′-monophosphate (dNMP) + H2O → free base (N) + deoxyribose 5-phosphate (dR5P). The existence of the two reaction products in stoichiometric amounts was demonstrated by using dIMP as a substrate and identifying enzymatically the end products, hypoxanthine and deoxyribose 5-phosphate, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No deoxyribose 5-phosphate transfer was detected, whether dCMP or dGMP was the donor or any base was the acceptor. In addition, no dNMP was synthesized when RCL was incubated in the presence of deoxyribose 5-phosphate and guanine (data not shown). We concluded that RCL cleaves the N-glycosidic bond of deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate to liberate deoxyribose 5-phosphate and the free base and that this reaction is not reversible. Hence, we found a previously undescribed enzyme, deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate N-glycosidase, that is encoded by Rcl, a Myc target with tumorigenic potential.FIGURE 3Alignment of the nucleoside 2-deoxyribosyltransferase cluster of orthologs (COG 3613).

In both cases at pH 8.0, only 10% of the enzyme activity remained. Several metals were tested for their ability to stimulate or inhibit the reaction, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Na+, and K+. Only Zn2+ inhibited the reaction, whereas the other metals had no effect. Initial velocity experiments were carried out at variable concentrations of the six deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate: dAMP, dCMP, dGMP, dIMP, dTMP, and dUMP (Table 1). The kinetic parameters with dGMP indicate that RCL is a typical Michaelian enzyme with a Km value of 50 μm and a Vmax of 0.09 units·mg-1, which correspond to a kcat of 0.0268 s-1. Purine deoxynucleotides have a better affinity for RCL than pyrimidine deoxynucleotides. The Km value of RCL for dCMP (4 mm), dUMP (15 mm), and dTMP (>50 mm) are high as compared with dGMP (50 μm), dAMP (250 μm), and dIMP (450 μm). The kcat/Km measure of substrate efficiency also indicates a preference for purine deoxynucleotides. RCL cleaves dGMP 20 times more efficiently than dAMP and 40 times more than dIMP. kcat/Km and Km of RCL for dGMP (619 m-1·s-1 and 48 μm) are comparable with that reported for the related nucleotide hydrolase BlsM from Streptomyces griseochromogenes for dCMP (146 m-1·s-1 and 65 μm) (24Grochowski L.L. Zabriskie T.M. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of His-RCL with different dNMPs as substrate Vmax and Km were obtained from double reciprocal plots of initial velocity measurements.

The initial velocity of the reaction was measured either at a variable concentration of dGMP, both in the absence and presence of inhibitors, or at fixed a concentration of dGMP and variable concentrations of inhibitors, allowing the testing of the nature of the inhibition. The double reciprocal plot confirms that GMP and 6-methylthio-GMP are competitive inhibitors for dGMP with a Ki value of 20 and 10 μm, respectively. Thus, the presence of an OH at the 2′ position of the sugar has a critical influence. The position of the phosphate is also important, as 2′-deoxyguanosine 3′-monophosphate is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of RCL. The presence of an oxo at position 8 of the base is sufficient to modify the recognition by RCL, as 8-oxo-dGMP is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor.Kinetic Parameters of RCL E105A Mutant—The similarity of the amino acids sequence and the similarity of reaction between RCL and N-deoxyribosyltransferase led us to investigate the catalytic mechanism. The Glu-105 was chosen for site-directed mutagenesis, because it is the active site nucleophile in L. leichmannii N-deoxyribosyltransferase (16Armstrong S.R. Cook W.J. Short S.A. Ealick S.E. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Porter D.J. Merrill B.M. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15551-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and because of its conservation in the different N-deoxyribosyltransferase-like sequences (Fig. 3). The Glu-105 mutated to Ala in RCL (Table 2) has a profound effect on the Km value, which is enhanced by a factor of 170, whereas the Vmax value remains in the same order of magnitude. It was thus concluded that Glu-105 may be involved in the substrate binding but is not the catalytic amino acid as found in L. leichmannii N-deoxyribosyltransferase.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of His-RCL (wild-type) and mutant His-RCL E105A with dGMP as substrate dGMP concentrations varied from 250 μm to 20 mm. Vmax and Km were obtained from double reciprocal plots of initial velocity measurements.EnzymekcatKmkcat/Km· s–1μmm–1 · s–1E105A variant0.017850003.6Wild-type0.029748619 Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONWith increasing numbers of genome sequences available, functional prediction of open reading frames is a significant advance, but defining precise functions of novel open reading frames remains a challenge despite sequence homology to known functional domains. For example, the clustering of orthologous groups (COGs) that brought together comparative genomics and protein classification has allowed the automatic functional annotation of genes and proteins (18Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar). Orthologs most often have equivalent functions, and COG 3613 illustrates all of the proteins with a conserved domain with N-deoxyribosyltransferase. In COG 3613, only two crystal structures of N-deoxyribosyltransferases in the presence of different ligands were described (16Armstrong S.R. Cook W.J. Short S.A. Ealick S.E. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Anand R. Kaminski P.A. Ealick S.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2384-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These structures allowed the determination of the amino acid residues important in substrate binding and catalysis and also explained the substrate specificity. Knowing this, we reconsidered the 3613 COG by focusing our interest on RCL. RCL was chosen for several reasons: (i) it was the more distant protein in the COG, (ii) its function was unknown, (iii) it was only present in mammals, and (iv) the Rcl gene is a Myc target gene, which is up-regulated in human cancers and has tumorigenic potential. By combining the structural data obtained with L. leichmannii and Lactobacillus helveticus N-deoxyribosyltransferases and the sequence identities of RCL and N-deoxyribosyltransferases, we hypothesized that the two proteins may have related activities with different substrate specificities. The biochemical experiments performed with either pure native RCL or with a His-tagged RCL demonstrate that it codes for a deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate glycosidase, a previously undescribed activity. Indeed, N-glycosylhydrolases with a pyrimidine preference have been described in Neisseria meningitidis (20Jyssum S. APMIS. 1989; 97: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), Streptomyces virginiae (21Imada A. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1967; 13: 267-278Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 22Imada A. Kuno M. Igarasi S. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1967; 13: 255-265Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and S. griseochromogenes (23Cone M.C. Yin X. Grochowski L.L. Parker M.R. Zabriskie T.M. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Grochowski L.L. Zabriskie T.M. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ribosylhydrolases specific for inosine or adenosine 5′-monophosphate were also reported (25Kuninaka A. Koso Kagaku Shinpojiumu. 1957; 12: 65Google Scholar, 26Leung H.B. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6972-6978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). None of them hydrolyze purine deoxynucleoside 5′-monophosphate. The RCL activity seems related to N-deoxyribosyltransferase, because in the absence of an acceptor base, L. leichmannii N-deoxyribosyltransferase catalyzes the hydrolysis of deoxynucleosides (27Smar M. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7908-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). L. leichmannii N-deoxyribosyltransferase is a hexamer in its native state, with one active site/subunit. A complete catalytic center requires the participation from a neighboring subunit, indicating that oligomerization is necessary for catalysis (16Armstrong S.R. Cook W.J. Short S.A. Ealick S.E. Structure (Camb.). 1996; 4: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Molecular mass measurement shows that RCL is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. It is notable that RCL (C6orf108) also dimerizes intracellularly in the yeast two-hybrid assay (5Lewis B.C. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C.S. Lee L.A. Maity A. Dang C.V. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W1998433561,"The precise positioning of nucleosomes plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression by modulating the DNA binding activity of trans-acting factors. However, molecular determinants responsible for positioning are not well understood. We examined whether the removal of the core histone tail domains from nucleosomes reconstituted with specific DNA fragments led to alteration of translational positions. Remarkably, we find that removal of tail domains from a nucleosome assembled on a DNA fragment containing a Xenopus borealis somatic-type 5S RNA gene results in repositioning of nucleosomes along the DNA, including two related major translational positions that move about 20 bp further upstream with respect to the 5S gene. In a nucleosome reconstituted with a DNA fragment containing the promoter of a Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase gene, several translational positions shifted by about 10 bp along the DNA upon tail removal. However, the positions of nucleosomes assembled with a DNA fragment known to have one of the highest binding affinities for core histone proteins in the mouse genome were not altered by removal of core histone tail domains. Our data support the notion that the basic tail domains bind to nucleosomal DNA and influence the selection of the translational position of nucleosomes and that once tails are removed movement between translational positions occurs in a facile manner on some sequences. However, the effect of the N-terminal tails on the positioning and movement of a nucleosome appears to be dependent on the DNA sequence such that the contribution of the tails can be masked by very high affinity DNA sequences. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby sequence-dependent nucleosome positioning can be specifically altered by regulated changes in histone tail-DNA interactions in chromatin.

In the eukaryotic cell, assembly of DNA into chromatin serves to organize and compact several meters worth of DNA several thousand-fold into a nucleus about 10 μm in diameter (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin, Springer Verlag, New York. 1989; Google Scholar). This condensation is accomplished in sequential steps. First, 147-bp stretches of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins to form a nucleosome core, which are spaced at ∼200-base pair intervals along the genomic DNA. In higher eukaryotes, approximately one linker histone binds each nucleosome and the “linker” DNA between the cores. Under physiological conditions, strings of nucleosomes spontaneously condense into secondary structures such as the 30-nm chromatin fiber and higher order tertiary structures and beyond (2Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 3Belmont A.S. Bruce K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 287-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The assembly of DNA into chromatin plays an integral role in the regulation of gene expression, primarily by regulating access of genomic DNA to trans-acting factors. For example, the activity of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins is greatly reduced for DNA targets located within the 147-bp nucleosome core region compared with linker DNA (4Polach K.J. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 130-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and initiation of transcription typically involves multiple processes that result in exposure or occlusion of cognate DNA sites within promoter regions (5Grunstein M.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) laboratories showed that nucleosomes are intimately involved in gene regulation and can act as specific repressors of transcription. Indeed recent genome-wide determinations of nucleosome positions indicate specific positioning of nucleosomes in the vicinity of many promoters in yeast (11Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L.

Biol. 2006; 13: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In some cases, specific post-translational modifications of core histone tails are involved in the recruitment of remodeling complexes to target sites and thus may facilitate nucleosome sliding by these complexes (21Agalioti T.

Cell. 2001; 106: 685-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For example, acetylation is required for transcription of the interferon-γ gene in mammalian cells or the HO gene in yeast cells (22Lomvardas S. Thanos D.

However, the actual mechanism of nucleosome mobilization or sliding remains the subject of much debate (24Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The core histones are each comprised of a histone-fold domain that oligomerizes to form the central protein spool onto which nucleosomal DNA is wrapped and an N-terminal tail domain, which represents about 20–25% of the mass of each core histone and projects out from the main body of the nucleosome core (25Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J.

The N-terminal tail domains play a central role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression presumably due to their direct role in defining the structural and functional state of chromatin. The tails are essential for folding of arrays of nucleosomes into condensed secondary and tertiary chromatin structures and are also the location of most of the transcription-related post-translational modifications within the core histones. Post-translational modifications such as acetylation can facilitate transcription by directly affecting the stability of higher order chromatin structures (28Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J.

Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that a major determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo can be ascribed to DNA sequence-dependent effects such as anisotropic flexibility and inherent curvature within DNA (11Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thastrom A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature. 2006; 442: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Using an algorithm based on a set of selected DNA sequences that exhibit high affinity for binding to the core histone octamer, Widom and colleagues (11Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thastrom A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature. 2006; 442: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) accurately predicted about 50% the nucleosome positions observed in vivo in yeast cells. Likewise, using a similar consensus nucleosome positioning element, Ioshikhes et al. (12Ioshikhes I.P. Albert I. Zanton S.J. Pugh B.F. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1210-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DNA sequence is likely the dominant influence directing the location of nucleosomes in the vicinity of promoters in yeast. They find a distinct class of promoters in which the TATA box is buried within a well defined nucleosome positioning element that is typically associated with genes known to be highly dependent on chromatin remodeling and histone modification enzymes. Thus, it is becoming clear that understanding molecular determinants of sequence-directed nucleosome positioning is critical to a complete understanding of the regulation of gene expression. Older experiments suggested that the tail domains do not contribute to the “choice” of translational position adopted by nucleosomes along a DNA sequence. The translational positioning of nucleosomes assembled with DNA fragments containing 5S genes from both Xenopus and sea urchin did not appear to be altered by the acetylation or removal of core histone tail domains (33Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 34Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, these experiments employed relatively low-resolution techniques that might be insensitive to small changes in translational positioning. Indeed, acetylation of the core histone tail domains was later shown to be required for the movement of nucleosomes already remodeled by SWI/SNF (22Lomvardas S. Thanos D. Cell. 2001; 106: 685-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and reconstitution of nucleosomes onto a 359-bp DNA fragment containing the Drosophila hsp70 promoter have shown that nucleosomes lacking the H2B N-terminal tail domain exhibited a different distribution of translational positions compared with nucleosomes containing wild type histones (36Hamiche A. Kang J.G. Dennis C. Xiao H. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14316-14321Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover these studies (33Dong F. Hansen J.C. van Holde K.E. Proc.

Here we investigate the effect of removal of the core histone tails on translational positions of nucleosomes reconstituted with specific DNA sequences. We demonstrate that the tail domains do indeed contribute to sequence-directed translational positioning as removal of tail domains from existing nucleosomes can lead to a re-distribution of translational positions along a DNA fragment. Preparation of the Radiolabeled DNA Fragments—A 215-bp DNA fragment containing nucleotides –78 to +137 of a Xenopus borealis somatic-type 5S RNA gene was obtained from plasmid pXP-10 (37Wolffe A.P. Jordan E. Brown D.D. Cell. 1986; 44: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) by digestion with EcoRI (New England Biolabs). The digested plasmid was treated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science), phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using [γ-32P]ATP, then cut with DdeI (New England Biolabs). All DNA fragments were purified from 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer. A 238-bp DNA fragment containing the 5S RNA gene, nucleotides –102 to +135, were prepared by end labeling after digestion with XbaI then digestion with HpaII by the same method. A 182-bp DNA fragment containing 12 (TATAAACGCC) repeats was prepared from plasmid pHCn41 by first cleaving with EcoRI, radiolabeling, then cutting with BamHI (38Widlund H.R. Kuduvalli P.N.

A 227-bp DNA fragment containing the promoter of an alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) 3The abbreviations used are: Adh, alcohol dehydrogenase; APB, 4-azidophenacyl bromide; ExoIII, exonuclease III. gene from Drosophila melanogaster was obtained from plasmid pX5′r-168 by digesting with XbaI, end labeling, then cleaving with ScaI. Reconstitution of Nucleosomes Containing Native, H2A-A12C-APB, H2A-A45C-APB, and H2B-S56C-APB Core Histones—Core histones were purified from chicken blood as H2A/H2B dimers and (H3/H4)2 tetramers according to standard procedures (39Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Mutant histone proteins H2A-A12C, H2A-A45C, and H2B-S56C were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, then modified with the cross-linking agent, 4-azidophenacyl bromide (APB), as described (40Yang Z. Zheng C. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted with chicken H3/H4 and recombinant H2A/H2B except where indicated via standard salt dialysis (41Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Preparation of Tailless Nucleosomes Containing H2A-A12C-APB, H2A-A45C-APB, and H2B-S56C-APB—Five ml of nucleosomes (400 μg) reconstituted with wild type H2A, H2A-A12C-APB, H2A-A45C-APB, and H2B-S56C-APB were concentrated to 0.5 ml by spin filtration (Millipore, YM-50), then treated with 0.04 ml of trypsin cross-linked agarose beads (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature (42Yang Z. Hayes J.J. Methods. 2004; 33: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The digest was then centrifuged to remove the beads, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and then the extent of trypsinization examined by 18% SDS-PAGE. Restriction Enzyme Selection for Major Translational Positions—Five ml of nucleosomes containing H2A-A45C-APB reconstituted with the 215-bp 5S DNA fragment were concentrated to 1 ml using centrifugal-based filter (Millipore) as described above, then treated with 50 units of BamHI (New England Biolabs) for 15 min at 37 °C. BamHI cleaves this DNA fragment at position –61 (Fig. 1). BamHI-resistant nucleosomes were then purified on sucrose gradients (10 ml, 5–20%), and fractions (∼1 ml) were subjected to a buffer-exchange procedure with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) to remove sucrose and the sample concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml. The nucleosomes were then incubated with trypsin-agarose beads to remove core histone tails by the method above (42Yang Z. Hayes J.J. Methods. 2004; 33: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The major translational positions within the H2A-A45C-APB-containing 5S nucleosomes reconstituted onto the 238-bp DNA fragment were enriched by AluI digestion by the above protocol because AluI cleaves the DNA template at nucleotide –54 (Fig. 1). To check efficiency of selection, samples were loaded into 5% translational polyacrylamide gel (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), electrophoresed at 106 V for 2 h at room temperature, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimager (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Determination of Restriction Enzyme Accessibility—The 5S nucleosomes were reconstituted, purified by sucrose gradient, then incubated with restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs), BamHI (1,000 units/ml), BbvI (500 units/ml), EcoRV (1,000 units/ml), RsaI (500 units/ml), and FokI (500 units/ml), respectively, for the times indicated in the figures at 37 °C. Samples were removed at each reaction time, quenched by adding SDS-EDTA stop solution (40 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS), loaded into 6% SDS-PAGE, then quantitated by phosphorimager. Determination of Cross-linking Positions—5S nucleosomes containing H2A-A45C-APB or H2B-S56C-APB core histones were purified by sucrose gradient, loaded into 0.7% agarose nucleoprotein gels. The nucleosomes were irradiated at 365 nm for 30 s before or after the removal of core histone tail domains. DNA was purified from each radioactive band in the preparative nucleoprotein gel, then cross-linked DNA was separated from uncross-linked on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (44Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DNA purified from the polyacrylamide gel was treated with NaOH, precipitated, then equivalent amounts of radioactivity were loaded onto 6% sequencing gels. The gels were dried and analyzed by phosphorimager (45Lee K.M. Chafin D.R. Hayes J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cross-linking within nucleosomes containing the (TATAAACGCC)12 repeats or the alcohol dehydrogenase gene promoter were determined by the same method. ExoIII Nuclease Assay—Intact or tailless nucleosomes purified by sucrose gradient were incubated with 0.5 μl of ExoIII nuclease (100 kilounits/ml, New England Biolabs) for 2, 5, or 10 min, then the reaction was quenched with an EDTA-SDS stop solution (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). DNA from each reaction was precipitated, then the cleavage products analyzed after separation on 6% sequencing gels as above. We wished to determine whether the core histone tail domains contribute to the selection of sequence-dependent nucleosome translational positions and specifically whether alteration of tail-DNA interactions would lead to mobilization and redistribution of nucleosome positions. In previous work we used a site-directed histone → DNA cross-linking method in which a APB was attached to the 12th residue in H2A, a position located adjacent to the DNA gyre, about 40 bp from the nucleosome dyad (44Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We observed that the pattern of cross-links within nucleosomes assembled on a 215-bp DNA fragment containing a Xenopus 5S RNA gene was drastically altered upon proteolytic removal of the tail domains, suggesting that the tails contribute to choice of translational positions on this DNA (40Yang Z. Zheng C. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further investigate this possibility, we repeated the cross-linking approach with APB attached to residue 45 within the histone-fold of H2A as APB attachment at this position has been used to precisely map nucleosome translational positions (46Kassabov S.R. Henry N.M. Zofall M. Tsukiyama T. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7524-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted with H2A-A45C-APB, native core histones H2B, H3 and H4, and the 215-bp 5S DNA fragment. Previous characterization of translational positions of nucleosomes reconstituted on this DNA fragment (40Yang Z. Zheng C. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 282: 683-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showed two main translational positions with dyad axes at approximately positions –3 and +8 and a set of minor positions at the downstream end of the fragment with dyad axes at approximately +45, +55, and +65 nucleotides (Fig. 1A). Importantly, we found that the APB modification did not significantly alter the overall distribution of translational positions as determined by translational gel analysis and restriction enzyme accessibility assays (results not shown, but see below) or the ability of trypsin to specifically remove the tail domains (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether the core histone tail domains influence selection of translational positions, 5S nucleosomes containing H2A-A45C-APB were irradiated to induce cross-linking before or after careful proteolytic removal of core histone tails (see “Experimental Procedures”). When these nucleosomes were irradiated before treatment with trypsin, we detected cross-links at positions +93, +83, +70, +45, +16, +6, and –8 (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Because H2A-A45C forms cross-links about 39 bp to either side of the dyad axis (46Kassabov S.R. Henry N.M. Zofall M. Tsukiyama T. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7524-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), cross-links at +93 and +16 correspond to a nucleosome position with a dyad axis at nucleotides +55, whereas cross-links at +83/+6 and +70/–8 correspond to nucleosomes with dyads at +45 and +31. These positions correspond to two of the minor downstream positions mentioned above. The cross-link at position +45 corresponds to a previously identified “major” position having a dyad axis at nucleotide +8 (50Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas very faint bands near +36 correspond to the major position with a dyad at –3. The positions and relative strengths of cross-links were not affected when the core histone tails were removed after irradiation, as expected (Fig. 2, lane 6). However, when H2A-A45C-APB 5S nucleosomes were irradiated after the removal of core histone tails, both the positions and intensities of cross-link bands were changed, with cross-links now found at +23, +64, +80, +102, +105, +108, and approximately +115, indicating that the distribution of translational positions was altered upon tail removal (Fig. 2, lane 7). These results were not dependent on the position of the cross-linker within the nucleosome as identical results were obtained with nucleosomes containing either H2A-A12C-APB, as mentioned above (40Yang Z. Zheng C. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or H2B-S56C-APB (46Kassabov S.R. Henry N.M. Zofall M. Tsukiyama T. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7524-7534Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (results not shown). These data indicate that the core histone tail domains play a role in selection of translational positions and that removal of these domains on pre-formed 5S nucleosomes induces a re-distribution of nucleosomes along the 5S DNA fragment. As mentioned above, previous results have shown that about 70% of the nucleosomes on the 5S DNA fragment occupy either of two related translational positions with dyads at approximately –3 and +8, near the start site of transcription of the 5S gene (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 48Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, cross-links corresponding to these major positions were much less prominent compared with signals corresponding to the minor downstream translational positions in the above experiments. To investigate potential reasons for the non-correspondence between cross-link signal intensity and nucleosome population, and to more accurately assess the effect of core histone tail removal on the main translational positions by the cross-linking methods, we prepared samples in which the population of nucleosomes was highly enriched for the major translational positions. Cleavage of the reconstituted nucleosomes with the restriction enzyme BamHI at position –61 (Fig. 1A) effectively removes the radiolabel from all nucleosomes with translational positions downstream from the major positions (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analysis of the 5S nucleosome sample before BamHI digestion on a polyacrylamide nucleoprotein gel, which resolves translational positions, shows a set of 5–6 bands (Fig. 3A, lane 1). The upper bands on the gel correspond to the more centrally located downstream minor translational positions, whereas the lower bands correspond to the major positions near the 5′ end of the fragment (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Upon digestion with BamHI, the upper bands were largely absent from the sample, whereas the lower bands were resistant to BamHI digestion, as expected (43Aoyagi S. Wade P.A. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30562-30568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, th"

In addition to hepatocytes, where both are highly expressed and contribute to plasma lipoprotein clearance, they are expressed in vascular cells and macrophages. In this study, we examined the effects of human apoE isoforms and LDLr levels in atherogenic pathways in primary macrophages ex vivo and atherosclerosis development after bone marrow transfer in vivo using mice expressing human apoE isoforms and different levels of LDLr expression. Increases in LDLr expression significantly increased cholesterol delivery into macrophages in culture, and the effects were more prominent with lipoproteins containing apoE4 than those containing apoE3. Conversely, increased LDLr expression reduced cholesterol efflux in macrophages expressing apoE4 but not in macrophages expressing apoE3. Furthermore, apoE3 protected VLDL from oxidation in vitro more than did apoE4. In LDLr-deficient mice expressing the human apoE4 isoform, Apoe4/4 Ldlr–/–, the replacement of bone marrow cells with those expressing LDLr increased atherosclerotic lesions in a dose-dependent manner compared with mice transplanted with cells having no LDLr. In contrast, atherosclerosis in Apoe3/3 Ldlr–/– mice, expressing the human apoE3 isoform, did not differ by the levels of macrophage LDLr expression. Our results demonstrate that apoE4, but not apoE3, in macrophages enhances atherosclerotic plaque development in mice in an LDLr-dependent manner and suggests that this interaction may contribute to the association of apoE4 with an increased cardiovascular risk in humans.

The bulk of these atherogenic lipoproteins are cleared from the circulation by the LDL receptor (LDLr) in the liver with apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apoB100 as ligands. There are three common apoE isoforms in humans: apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4, each having distinct influences on both lipid metabolism and atherogenesis in humans (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). Possession of at least one copy of the APOE*2 allele is associated with higher plasma apoE and triglyceride but lower LDL cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis risk when compared with APOE*3 homozygotes (1Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2000; 1: 507-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). In contrast, the presence of at least one APOE*4 allele is associated with lower plasma apoE, increased LDL cholesterol, and a greater risk of coronary artery disease than APOE*3 homozygotes. This association is thought to be mainly due to differences in lipoprotein clearance and is counterintuitive, considering the LDLr affinity of apoE2 is lower while the affinity of apoE4 is slightly higher than apoE3 (2Bohnet K.

To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the relationship between atherosclerosis risk and apoE isoform in humans, we previously made mice expressing human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4 in place of the endogenous mouse apoE (3Knouff C. Hinsdale M.E. Mezdour H. Altenburg M.K. Watanabe M. Quarfordt S.H. Sullivan P.M. Maeda N. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 4Sullivan P.M. Mezdour H.

Notably, the atherosclerosis risk associated with the resulting mice was different from that in humans; mice with apoE2 had increased plasma lipids and developed atherosclerosis, whereas mice with apoE3 and apoE4 were normolipidemic and resistant to atherosclerosis. To further test whether the apoE isoform-dependent atherosclerosis risk is affected by the LDLr expression, we also developed mice in which the endogenous mouse Ldlr gene was replaced with a gene (hLdlr) coding for human LDLr. The transcriptional regulation of the hLdlr gene was normal, but the steady state levels of its mRNA in the liver were elevated, because the transcripts carry a more stable 3′-untranslated region sequence than normal. Somewhat unexpectedly, we found that, when this hLdlr allele was introduced into mice expressing human apoE isoforms, physiologic overexpression of the LDLr was protective in mice with apoE2 but caused severe atherosclerosis in mice with apoE4, recapitulating the associations between apoE isoforms and atherosclerosis risk seen in humans (6Malloy S.I.

These data suggest that the LDLr apoE interaction is central to the increased atherosclerosis risk associated with apoE4. A substantial portion of the atherosclerosis risk associated with apoE4 is probably due to its hepatic metabolism by the LDLr and the resultant changes to plasma lipids. However, there is ample in vitro evidence that the interaction of apoE with the LDLr in the liver may not be entirely responsible for the risk of coronary artery disease associated with apoE4 in humans (8Ishigami M.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1670-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both ApoE and the LDLr are expressed in many cell types and are thought to play roles in the atherosclerotic process beyond their role in lipoprotein clearance (11Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The effects on atherogenesis of apoE isoforms and levels of LDLr in extrahepatic tissues (e.g. in macrophages) are difficult to study in vivo, because their combined effects on plasma lipids are confounding. Herein, we address the effect of LDLr expression level and human apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms on lipoprotein uptake and efflux in macrophages isolated from mice having human apoE isoforms and different levels of LDLr expression. We also examined in vivo whether the interactions between apoE and LDLr in macrophages, independent of global LDLr expression, affect atherosclerosis after bone marrow transfer (BMT) in mice expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 and lacking LDLr (3ko or 4ko) (12Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19127) Google Scholar). We found that the expression of LDLr in macrophages directly correlated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice with human apoE4. In contrast, macrophage LDLr expression did not affect atherosclerosis in mice expressing apoE3. These results indicate that apoE4 exerts adverse effects on bone marrow-derived cells in the vessel wall in an LDLr-dependent manner and may contribute to its pathogenesis. Mice—All the mutant mouse strains used in this work were individually backcrossed at least 6 generations to C57BL/6 genetic background before intercrossing. Mice heterozygous for a targeted replacement of the mouse Ldlr gene with the stabilized human Ldlr minigene (Apoe+/+Ldlrh/+) (13Knouff C. Malloy S. Wilder J. Altenburg M.K. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were bred to mice homozygous for replacement of the mouse apoE gene with either the human APOE*3 or APOE*4 allele (Apoe3/3Ldlr+/+ and Apoe4/4Ldlr+/+) (3Knouff C.

The littermates generated by crossing Apoe3/3Ldlr+/+ (3m) with Apoe3/3Ldlrh/+ (3h) and Apoe4/4Ldlr+/+ (4m) with Apoe4/4Ldlrh/+ (4h), respectively, were used in experiments as donors of bone marrow cells. Mice with human APOE*3 and lacking LDLr (3ko) and mice with human APOE*4 and lacking LDLR (4ko) were generated by crossing either Apoe3/3 or Apoe4/4 mice with Ldlr–/– mice (6Malloy S.I.

Mice were fed either normal mouse chow containing 4.5% (w/w) fat and 0.022% (w/w) cholesterol (Prolab RMH 3000; Agway Inc.) or a high fat Western-type (HFW) diet containing 21% (w/w) fat and 0.2% (w/w) cholesterol (TD88137; Teklad). The animals were handled under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC).TABLE 1Genotypes of miceMiceGenotypeDescription3mApoe3/3, Ldlr+/+Human apoE33hApoe3/3, Ldlrh/+Human apoE3 and increased LDLR3koApoe3/3, Ldlr-/-Human apoE3 and no LDLR4mApoe4/4, Ldlr+/+Human apoE44hApoe4/4, Ldlrh/+Human apoE4 and increased LDLR4koApoe4/4, Ldlr-/-Human apoE4 and no LDLR Open table in a new tab Peritoneal Macrophage Isolation—Macrophages (MPM) were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of mice 4 days after intraperitoneal injection of 1 ml of 4% (w/v) thioglycolate (BD Biosciences). The cells obtained were either directly used for gene expression analyses (below) or washed with Ham’s nutrient mixture F-10 medium (F-10), spun at 1000 × g for 5 min, and plated in 12-well plates at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well in F-10 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were washed 2 h later to remove nonadherent cells. Cells were cultured in medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h prior to experiments. Lipoprotein Uptake—LDL was isolated from human plasma as described (7Knouff C. Briand O. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Altenburg M. Maeda N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mouse VLDL fractions enriched with human apoE3 or apoE4 were isolated from pooled plasma of 3ko or 4ko mice, respectively, by ultracentrifugation at d < 1.006. Lipoproteins were labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI C18; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), as described by Stephan and Yurachek (14Stephan Z.F. Yurachek E.C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 325-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages in culture were washed and incubated in F-10 medium without fetal bovine serum for 24 h, followed by incubation with medium containing 1 μg/ml of DiI-labeled human LDL or mouse VLDL. After 2 h, cells were washed with fresh medium, and fluorescence was observed with an IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus) equipped with a filter set for Texas red (exciter 560/55, dichroic 595, emitter 645/75; Chroma Technology Corp.). Fluorescence pixel intensity of each cell was recorded with a SPOT RT Slider digital camera and analyzed with SPOT version 4.0.9 (Diagnostic Instruments) and ImageJ 1.33u software (National Institutes of Health). Cholesterol Efflux—MPM were cultured 24 h in F-10 medium without fetal bovine serum. Cells were radiolabeled by incubating with 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 24 h. They were then washed and further incubated for 24 h with F-10 medium with or without 10 μg/ml of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) protein (Sigma). Following incubation, medium was removed, spun at 12,500 × g for 15 min, and assayed for radioactivity. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lipids were extracted with isopropyl alcohol for 4 h and assayed for radioactivity. Radiolabel in the medium and the cellular isopropyl alcohol extract was measured, and percentage effluxed was calculated as the ratio of radioactivity in the medium divided by the total (cells + medium). To analyze efflux of cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded foam cells, MPM were incubated with acetylated human LDL (AcLDL) and 2 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 24 h, and efflux was measured after 16 h. LDL (density 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was acetylated by acetic anhydride (15Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Western Blot—To measure ApoE protein content, MPM in culture were washed and cultured in lipid-free F-10 medium. After 24 h, the amount of apoE protein associated with cells and in the medium was measured using Western blot with an antibody against human apoE (Calbiochem). Protein loading was controlled by the amount of tubulin using anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma), and gel to gel control for densitometric analysis was done with a standard amount of apoE. Oxidative Stress—VLDL (1 μg of protein) from the 3ko or 4ko mice was incubated with 10 μm CuSO4 as described (16Mabile L. Lefebvre C. Lavigne J. Boulet L. Davignon J. Lussier-Cacan S. Bernier L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Oxidation and the increase in the formation of conjugated dienes were measured by recording their absorbance at 234 nm every 20 min for 3 h. The lag time was determined graphically. Amounts of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma, VLDL, and cultured medium were assayed as described (16Mabile L. Lefebvre C. Lavigne J. Boulet L. Davignon J. Lussier-Cacan S. Bernier L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MPM were cultured with VLDL isolated from apoE-deficient mice (50 μg/ml of F-10 medium) for 24 h. Oxidized VLDL was prepared by incubating VLDL in 10 μm CuSO4 for 24 h. Gene Expression—RNA was extracted from MPM using RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, either directly from peritoneal cells of mice that underwent BMT or cultured MPM from mice fed the HFW diet. Cultured macrophage cells were incubated with F-10 medium or F-10 medium plus 50 μg/ml apoE-deficient VLDL for 16 h. Real time RT-PCR amplifications (8Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Hui M.S. Granholm N.A. Hui D.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1020-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were performed in a 96-well plate in the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems) in a total volume of 30 μl, which included 10 μl of RNA sample from the ABI Prism 6700 plus 20 μl of a reaction mixture. Each RT-PCR amplification was performed in duplicate: 30 min at 48 °C for the RT reaction and then 10 min at 94 °C, followed by a total of 40 temperature cycles (15 s at 94 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). To determine total Ldlr mRNA levels, a primer probe system specific for murine exon 1, which is also present in mice targeted for the hLdlr, was used (13Knouff C. Malloy S. Wilder J. Altenburg M.K. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bone Marrow Transfer—Bone marrow cells were collected from the femurs and tibias of donor male mice by flushing with F-10 medium. Recipient female mice, 6–8 weeks of age, were lethally irradiated (9.5 grays) and injected with 2 × 106 bone marrow cells in 0.2 ml of medium through tail veins. For 2 weeks after transplantation, mice were given drinking water acidified to pH 2.0 by HCl and containing 100 mg/liter neomycin. Mice were fed an HFW diet for 3 months. Plasma Lipids, Lipoprotein Analysis—Plasma was isolated, and total cholesterol (free and esterified) and triglycerides were measured as described previously (6Malloy S.I. Altenburg M.K. Knouff C. Lanningham-Foster L. Parks J.S. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein distribution in pooled plasma samples (100 μl) was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 6 HR10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Lesions—BM recipient mice were fed an HFW diet for 12 weeks before sacrifice. Mice were perfused through the apex of the left ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde under physiological pressures. Segments of the aortic sinus were embedded and sectioned, and the size of atherosclerotic plaques in aortic roots were scored as described previously (17Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of genotype effects were analyzed by using analysis of variance (JMP software; SAS Inc., Cary, NC). Tukey-Kramer HSD was used for post hoc pairwise comparisons. Down-regulation of the LDLr Expression by Lipid in Macrophages—Our previous work (6Malloy S.I. Altenburg M.K. Knouff C. Lanningham-Foster L. Parks J.S. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Knouff C. Malloy S. Wilder J. Altenburg M.K. Maeda N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) showed that the 3′-untranslated region modification within the hLdlr allele made its transcripts in the liver more stable than the normal mouse allele, but the hLdlr allele retained the transcriptional repression in response to dietary cholesterol intake. To test whether the expression of the hLdlr allele is also normally regulated in macrophages by exogenous lipid, we isolated MPM from 3m, 3h, 4m, and 4h mice (see Table 1) and placed them in culture. Both 3h and 4h MPM cells cultured for 16 h without VLDL had higher LDLr expression than 3m and 4m MPM cells by ∼3–4-fold (Fig. 1, p ≤ 0.0001). The levels of Ldlr mRNA decreased in all MPM cells when they were incubated with apoE-deficient VLDL for 16 h, and the decrease was proportional whether cells had wild type or elevated LDLr. However, cells with apoE4 had greater proportional decreases in LDLr expression compared with cells with apoE3. Thus, the hLdlr gene in macrophages retains its normal feedback response to increased intracellular lipid and can be down-regulated by high levels of lipid, but its transcripts remain 2–3-fold higher than the wild type Ldlr mRNA. LDLr Expression and Lipoprotein Uptake in Macrophages—To test whether increased expression of the LDLr in macrophages increases uptake of lipoproteins we isolated MPM from 4ko, 4m, and 4h mice and incubated them with DiI-labeled human LDL in culture. After 2 h, intracellular fluorescent intensity in 4h macrophages was twice that of 4m macrophages and three times higher than 4ko cells (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that the LDL uptake by macrophages directly correlates with LDLr expression. In hyperlipidemic mice, as well as humans, lipoprotein particles accumulate not only in LDL fractions but also in VLDL fractions. For example, in the plasma of LDLr–/– mice with human apoE, VLDL particles are enriched with cholesterol and triglyceride, as well as apoE protein (7Knouff C. Briand O. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Altenburg M. Maeda N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1684: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore incubated the MPM with VLDL fractions enriched in apoE3 or apoE4 from 3ko and 4ko mice. Uptake of the mouse apoE3-enriched VLDL particles by 3h MPM was modestly but significantly increased compared with that by 3ko MPM (9%, p = 0.02; Fig. 2B). Uptake of apoE3-enriched VLDL by the 4h MPM was not different from the uptake by the 4m MPM. In marked contrast, both 3h and 4h MPM incorporated significantly more apoE4-enriched VLDL than 3ko and 4ko MPM (33% (p ≤ 0.0001) and 26% (p ≤ 0.0001), respectively) (Fig. 2C). This suggests that the apoE isoform present on the VLDL particle and the LDLr in the macrophages, but not macrophage apoE, influences uptake and that apoE4 in the particles promotes VLDL uptake more than apoE3. Taken together, the data suggest that increased LDLr in macrophages by mRNA stabilization causes increased uptake of LDL particles as well as VLDL particles, and the VLDL uptake would be more pronounced when the particles contain apoE4 rather than apoE3. Effects of ApoE4 and LDLr Expression on Cholesterol Efflux from Macrophages—To examine whether the different apoE isoforms facilitate cholesterol efflux from macrophages differently and whether the effect is dependent on the levels of LDLr expression in macrophages, we measured cholesterol efflux from MPM isolated from mice expressing human apoE isoforms with high levels of LDLr (3h and 4h) or without LDLr (3ko and 4ko). In unloaded cells expressing apoE3, cholesterol efflux was not influenced by the LDLr expression when cells were incubated without apoA-I. In contrast, the LDLr expression had a significant effect when cells expressed apoE4, and the efflux from the 4h cells was 30% less than from 4ko cells (p ≤ 0.0005; Fig. 3A). The addition of apoA-I to the culture medium increased cholesterol efflux from cells regardless of apoE isoforms (Fig. 3B). ApoA-I-mediated efflux from the 4h cells with elevated expression of LDLr was significantly higher than 4ko cells not expressing LDLr. The difference was larger and significant between 4ko and 4h cells (p < 0.003) than between 3ko and 3h cells (not significant). In contrast, efflux of cholesterol from cholesterol-loaded foam cells after incubation with AcLDL depended on LDLr but not on apoE genotype (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that the LDLr expression in macrophages influences the cholesterol efflux in an apoE isoform-dependent fashion when macrophages are cultured in lipid-free medium and suggest that both apoE isoform and LDLr expression may be important determinants for foam cell formation. However, when cells were loaded with AcLDL, apoE isoform effects were no longer detectable. ApoE Secretion from Cultured MPM—To address whether cholesterol efflux is related to the intracellular levels of apoE isoforms, we examined the apoE contents associated with cells and in medium 24 h after culturing in lipid-free F-10 medium by Western blot analysis. The intracellular apoE contents in both 3h and 4h cells were consistently higher than in 3ko and 4ko cells (Fig. 3D). Similarly, apoE protein contents in culture medium of 3ko and 4ko cells were lower than those of 3h and 4h cells. Relative amounts between apoE3 cells and apoE4 cells somewhat varied culture by culture and were not consistently different. We conclude that LDLr expression in MPM significantly affects apoE uptake and secretion and probably influences the cholesterol efflux. VLDL Oxidation—We next tested whether lipoprotein oxidation in our mice is apoE isoform-dependent, which may be due to the free cysteinyl groups on apoE3 and apoE2 (9Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 16Mabile L. Lefebvre C. Lavigne J. Boulet L. Davignon J. Lussier-Cacan S. Bernier L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 90: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). ApoE2 has two free cysteinyl groups, and apoE3 has one, and both have been shown to function as a better antioxidant than apoE4 protein, which has no free cysteinyl group. We isolated human apoE-enriched VLDL particles from 2ko, 3ko, and 4ko mice and tracked conjugated diene formation during Cu2+-mediated oxidation of these lipoprotein particles. The lag time for conjugated diene formation was 24 min in VLDL isolated from 4ko mice compared with 49 min in VLDL from 3ko mice and the longest, 70 min, in 2ko VLDL (Fig. 4A). Measurement of TBARS after overnight oxidation showed that apoE4-VLDL contained 3-fold more TBARS than did apoE3-VLDL (Fig. 4B). To test whether expression of LDLr in macrophages influences VLDL oxidation in an apoE-dependent manner, we next cultured MPM in medium with apoE-deficient VLDL for 24 h and measured TBARS in medium as an indicator for oxidized lipids. The amounts of TBARS were borderline detectable and were slightly higher in medium cultured with apoE4 macrophages than with apoE3 and lower with elevated LDLr than with no LDLr, but neither apoE genotype nor LDLr had statistically significant effects by two-way analysis of variance. These data suggest that the apoE4 isoform does not protect lipoprotein particles from oxidation as well as apoE3 when a strong oxidative stress is applied in vitro. However, effects of apoE isoforms in macrophages on oxidation in culture are not significant, even under conditions of elevated triglycerides and cholesterol. In addition, we did not detect any statistical differences in the amount of TBARS or GSH in the plasma of 3ko and 4ko recipient mice (data not shown). BMT and Plasma Lipids—The experiments above indicate that apoE4 proves to be impaired relative to apoE3 in several pathways important to lipid homeostasis in macrophages and perhaps atherosclerosis lesion formation, and the effects are influenced by the levels of LDLr expression in macrophages. To test whether the observed differences could alter overall atherogenesis in vivo, we carried out BMT in mice lacking LDLr but expressing human apoE3 (3ko) or apoE4 (4ko). To alter macrophage expression of LDLr, 3ko or 4ko females were lethally irradiated and transplanted with BM isolated from male mice with the same ApoE genotype, having no LDLr (3ko, 4ko), wild type LDLr (3m, 4m), or elevated expression of LDLr (3h, 4h). Three months after BMT, PCR of the Ldlr gene in the blood cells of the recipient animals showed only the products corresponding to the genotype of the donor cells, and no visible products corresponding to the recipient genotype (ko) were detected in the mice that received m or h BM cells (Fig. 5A). This confirmed that the replacement of the BM-derived cells in the recipients by the donor cells was probably complete. The total Ldlr mRNA levels in the peritoneal cells isolated from representative recipient mice showed that the macrophages in the 3ko mice receiving 3h BM cells had 4-fold higher Ldlr gene expression than the macrophages in the 3ko mice receiving 3m BM cells. Similarly, total expression of the Ldlr gene in macrophages from the 4ko mice receiving 4h BM cells was 4-fold higher than in those receiving 4m cells (Fig. 5B). Thus the levels of Ldlr mRNA in mice that received 3h or 4h bone marrow are elevated compared with those in mice that received wild type LDLr to similar degrees as the MPM cells"

We tested the behavior of a stress inducible fluorescent HepG2 model in which Heat Shock Protein promoters controlled Enhanced-Green Fluorescent Protein expression upon exposure to Cadmium Chloride (CdCl2), Sodium Arsenate (NaAsO2) and Paraquat. In agreement with previous studies based on a micro-well format, we could observe a chemical-specific response, identified through differences in dynamics and amplitude. We especially determined IC50 values for CdCl2 and NaAsO2, in agreement with published data. Individual cell identification via image-based screening allowed us to perform multiparametric analyses.Using pre/sub lethal cell stress instead of cell mortality, we highlighted the high significance and the superior sensitivity of both stress promoter activation reporting and cell morphology parameters in measuring the cell response to a toxicant. These results demonstrate the first generation of high-throughput and high-content assays, capable of assessing chemical hazards in vitro within the REACH policy framework."

We have reported that pulmonary surfactant protein A, which plays important roles in host defense in lungs, promotes SR-A-mediated phagocytosis by stimulating alveolar macrophages to induce increased surface expression of SR-A (22Kuronuma K. Sano H. Kato K. Kudo K. Hyakushima N. Yokota S. Takahashi H. Fujii N. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Abe S. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21421-21430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of intracellular trafficking of SR-A remains to be clarified. Cell surface SR-A proteins are activated upon ligand binding, enter cells via coated pits and traffic the endocytic pathway, recycling between early endosomal compartments and the cell surface (23Mori T. Takahashi K. Naito M. Kodama T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Horiuchi S. Ando M. Lab. Investig. 1994; 71: 409-416PubMed Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the functional partners involved in the sorting and recycling pathways of SR-A. Although the interaction of SR-A with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum has recently been described (24Tian G. Wilcockson D. Perry V.H. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Platt N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39303-39309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), other intracellular molecules that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of SR-A and regulate the receptor trafficking have not been identified yet. To get a better understanding of the mechanism underlying SR-A recycling, we sought to find SR-A-interacting molecules participating in the receptor trafficking. In this report, we demonstrate for the first time that a microtubule-binding protein, Hook3 (HK3), is one of the molecules interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of SR-A. Microtubules directly interact with a variety of endocytic compartments and are required for organelle movement (25Gruenberg J. Griffiths G. Howell K.E. J.

Cell. 2006; 124: 997-1009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We suggest that HK3 may be involved in the mechanism of the intracellular trafficking and clearance of the endocytosed receptor. Antibodies—Anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (Ab) for immunoblotting was purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratories (Nagoya, Japan). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-V5 polyclonal Ab for flow cytometric analysis, and anti-V5 mAb-agarose (V5–10) were obtained from Sigma. The rat anti-mouse scavenger receptor A mAb (2F8) was purchased from Serotech (Oxford, United Kingdom). Anti-GAPDH mAb was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Anti-human HK3 (hHK3) polyclonal antibody was generated as described previously (28Walenta J.H. Didier A.J. Liu X. Kraömer H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against a rat HK3 isoform-ΔN was raised in rabbits against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (QLIMSSIKHLPEG) corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of rat Ac1288 mRNA. Cell Culture—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS, and Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells (from ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Plasmids and Transfection—The full-length human SR-AI cDNA was isolated from THP-1 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR, and human SR-A (hSR-A) lacking the first 24 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (SR-AΔ1–24) was amplified by PCR from the full-length hSR-AI cDNA using the 5′-primer containing a methionine start codon and a spacer alanine codon. The mutant SR-A, SR-A12,13,15A, in which Glu12, Asp13, and Asp15 were replaced by alanine, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the full-length hSR-AI cDNA as a template. These SR-A cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5/His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) containing the C-terminal fusion V5 tag. Human HK3 cDNA was obtained from HEK293 cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into p3xFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma) containing the C-terminal fusion FLAG tag. The C-terminal truncation of hHK3, ΔC-hHK31–555, and the N-terminal truncation, ΔN-hHK3168–718, were described previously (28Walenta J.H. Didier A.J. Liu X. Kraömer H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and stable cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate (BioLinks, Tokyo, Japan). Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed using BD Matchmaker Library Construction & Screening Kits (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. As a bait plasmid, hSR-AI cDNA was subcloned into pGBKT7 vector including TRP1, and transformed into yeast strain Y187. Rat alveolar macrophages were obtained by lavaging the lungs with PBS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). As a prey, the double strand cDNA library of rat alveolar macrophages was then constructed and cotransformed into yeast strain AH109 together with pGADT7-Rec vector including Leu2. AH109 contains ADE2, HIS3, MEL1, and lacZ under the control of heterologous GAL4 upstream activating sequences. After mating the bait and prey culture, the mating mixture was spread onto master plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan to select for colonies containing both plasmids. The positive clones were finally isolated, sequenced, and analyzed using BLAST search. Analysis of GST-hSR-A-CD-associated Proteins—The cDNA sequence encoding the hSR-AI cytoplasmic domain (CD) (MEQWDHFHNQQEDTDSCSESVKFDARSMTALLPPNPKNSPSLQEKLKSFK) was amplified by PCR from the full-length hSR-AI cDNA using 3′-primer containing stop codon (TGA). The hSR-A-CD cDNA was inserted into pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and the plasmid was inoculated to Escherichia coli JM109. Protein expression was induced by amplifying the bacteria in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h, and bacterial extract was obtained by probe sonication on ice in PBS containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The fusion protein was then isolated on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and cell lysates isolated from rat alveolar macrophages were applied to a GST-hSR-A-CD-conjugated Sepharose column. After the extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 1 m NaCl, precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 2 h, and collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and pH adjusted to an alkaline range with 2 m Tris for resolution on SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained bands were excised from gels, destained in 50% acetonitrile, and analyzed using mass spectrometry. Pull-down Assay—In addition to hSR-AI-CD (Met1–Lys50), GST-conjugated CD11 (Met1–Gln11), CD24 (Met1–Asp24), and CD44 (Met1–Glu44) were purified as described above. HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged hHK3 were lysed in lysis buffer as described previously (22Kuronuma K. Sano H. Kato K. Kudo K. Hyakushima N. Yokota S. Takahashi H. Fujii N. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Abe S. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21421-21430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of the lysates (150 μg) were incubated in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer with GST- or GST-hSR-A-CD-Sepharose at room temperature for 3 h. After washing the Sepharose, bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer by boiling for 5 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, and probed with anti-FLAG mAb in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 3% (w/v) skim milk. The membrane was further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG, and the proteins on the membrane were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (SuperSignal, Pierce). Immunoprecipitation Assay—For cross-linking, cells were treated with 0.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) at 37 °C for 30 min. Equal amounts of cell lysates from HEK293 cells stably expressing hSR-A were incubated in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (22Kuronuma K. Sano H. Kato K. Kudo K. Hyakushima N. Yokota S. Takahashi H. Fujii N.

Cell lysates from Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells were incubated with anti-mouse SR-A mAb (2F8) (10 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were recovered by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing the Sepharose, the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot as described above using anti-HK3 polyclonal antibody (1:4000). To examine the effect of the presence of an SR-A ligand, HEK293 cells in a 12-well plate were washed with DMEM and further incubated with either fucoidan or mannose (500 μg/ml) for the indicated periods at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FCS. After the incubation, cells were collected and lysed, and the immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described above. siRNA—Synthesis of small interfering RNA (siRNA) was performed using the Silencer siRNA Construction Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The selected sequence for siRNA targeting HK3 was 5′-TTGATCGTCAGCTGAAGAAAA. siRNA targeting GAPDH and negative control siRNA were purchased from Ambion. Cells were transfected with siRNA by the reverse transfection method. The mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 and purified siRNA (30 nm for HEK293 cells or 15 nm for Raw264.7 cells) was plated onto a dish, and then trypsinized cells were added and incubated for 48–72 h. Cell lysates isolated from siRNA-transfected cells were analyzed by Western blot using anti-HK3 polyclonal antibody (1:4000), anti-GAPDH mAb (1:4000), and either anti-mouse SR-A mAb 2F8 (1:50) or anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (1:1000). Surface Expression of hSR-A—Adherent cells in a 6-well plate were collected and incubated for 30 min on ice in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were further incubated in the same buffer with anti-V5 polyclonal Ab (8 μg/ml) for 1 h on ice followed by incubation with Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min. After washing, the cell-associated fluorescence was assessed using FACSCalibur and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). AcLDL Internalization—Adherent cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-AcLDL (3.75 μg/ml, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in PBS. AcLDL internalization was assessed by quantifying the fluorescence associated with ∼50,000 cells using flow cytometry. To determine nonspecific binding, fucoidan (500 μg/ml) (Sigma) was added 5 min before addition of AcLDL. hSR-A Protein Synthesis—HEK293 cells stably expressing hSR-A (1.5 × 105) were transfected with or without hHK3 siRNA or negative control siRNA (30 nm) using a 12-well plate. After incubation for 72 h, the cells were washed and incubated for 15 min in methionine-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FCS. The cells were then labeled with 100 μCi/ml Redivue™ l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h, washed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. V5-tagged hSR-A was sedimented from the cell lysates using anti-V5-agarose and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Biotinylated hSR-A Degradation—HEK293 cells expressing hSR-A were transfected with or without HK3 siRNA as described above. The cells were washed with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and cell-surface proteins were labeled with EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (1 mg/ml) (Pierce) in cold PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by washing and incubating the cells in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm glycine at 4 °C for 10 min. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% FCS in the presence of 100 μg/ml fucoidan for the indicated periods. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from the cell lysates by using streptavidin-agarose (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Western blot. The amount of biotinylated hSR-A was quantified using Luminous Imager (Aisin Seiki, Kariya, Japan). Other Methods—Stripping for re-probing of Western blot was performed using Re-Blot Plus mild antibody stripping solution (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). The significance of differences was determined using the Student’s t test. Rat HK3 Isoform Is a Ligand of hSR-A—Because SR-A is expressed primarily by macrophages, we first performed a yeast two-hybrid screening assay between hSR-A cDNA and the rat alveolar macrophage cDNA library. As a bait, the Y187 yeast strain was transformed with hSR-AI cDNA in pGBKT7 vector. For a prey, we constructed a double strand cDNA library of rat alveolar macrophages and cotransformed it into the AH109 strain with pGADT7-Rec vector. The Ade, His, Leu, Trp, and LacZ positive clones were sequenced and analyzed using BLAST search. The results indicated that one of the positive clones encoded a sequence identical to rat Ac1288 mRNA (accession number AY310154). This sequence is a splice variant of the predicted rat homolog of a human microtubule-binding protein Hook3 (XM_224952) that is derived from the same genomic region in rat chromosome 16q12.4 (gi:62750816). When compared with the full-length sequence of human HK3, the AY310154 sequence lacks the region corresponding to the N terminus of hHK3, whereas the XM_224952 sequence does not involve the C-terminal region of hHK3. Thus, we here designate the AY310154-encoded protein as a rat HK3 isoform-ΔN, and the XM_224952-encoded protein as a rat HK3 isoform-ΔC (Fig. 1A). Although the interaction of hSR-A with a rat HK3 isoform-ΔN was suggested, we could not find positive clones encoding a rat HK3 isoform-ΔC in the yeast two-hybrid screening. To screen the ligands of hSR-A by another method, we next constructed a GST fusion protein with the full-length CD of hSR-A (Fig. 2A) and prepared an affinity matrix using glutathione-agarose beads. Cell lysates from rat alveolar macrophages were passed through the matrix, and bound proteins were eluted with 1.0 m NaCl for resolution on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, lane 1, we could detect a protein band with a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa. Interestingly, mass spectrometry suggested that the protein contained sequences identical to hHK3. To confirm the molecular mass of this rat HK3 isoform, we purified a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic peptide (QLMSSIKHLPEG) corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN. When the cell lysates from rat alveolar macrophages were analyzed by Western blot using the purified antibody against the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN, a protein band of ∼65 kDa was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The result indicated that the 65-kDa protein eluted from the hSR-A-CD column may be the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN. Thus, the results of two different approaches: yeast two-hybrid assay and mass spectrometry analysis of hSR-A-CD-bound proteins, suggested that there was an interaction between hSR-A and a homologeous protein of hHK3 in rat alveolar macrophages. Human HK3 Interacts with the Negatively Charged Residues of hSR-A Cytoplasmic Domain—Because our data indicated that the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN binds to the cytoplasmic tail of hSR-A, we next investigated whether human HK3 interacted with hSR-A. To determine the hSR-A region required for interaction with hHK3, the glutathione-agarose affinity matrix was prepared using GST-conjugated CD44, CD24, or CD11, which was composed of 1–44, 1–24, or 1–11 amino acids of the hSR-A cytoplasmic tail, respectively. We designed CD44 because 1–49 amino acids of murine SR-A, which correspond to 1–44 amino acids in hSR-A, have been demonstrated to be necessary for receptor internalization (18Kosswig N. Rice S. Daugherty A. Post S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CD11 was prepared because the region Glu12–Lys50 is highly conserved between human and murine, whereas the first 11 amino acids have no similarity. CD24 was designed to focus on the negatively charged assembly (Fig. 2A, underline). Cell lysates from FLAG-tagged hHK3-expressing cells were prepared, and pull-down assays were performed by using GST, GST-CD, -CD44, -CD24, or -CD11-bound glutathione-Sepharose. As shown in Fig. 2B, hHK3 was pulled down by CD44 and CD24 as well as by GST-CD, but not by CD11. These results indicate that overexpressed hHK3 interacts with the hSR-A cytoplasmic domain, and further suggest that the Glu12–Asp24 region in the hSR-A cytoplasmic domain was involved in the binding to hHK3. The binding between endogenous hHK3 and hSR-A was examined by immunoprecipitations. We constructed full-length hSR-A, deletion mutant SR-AΔ1–24, which lacks the first 24 amino acids of hSR-A, and SR-A12,13,15A in which negatively charged Glu12, Asp13, and Asp15 are replaced by alanine. All constructs possess the V5-tag at the C terminus. When these hSR-A constructs were expressed in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-V5-agarose, endogenous hHK3 was co-sedimented with full-length hSR-A but not with either SR-AΔ1–24 or SR-A12,13,15A (Fig. 2C). The results are consistent with those of the GST-CD pull-down assay and demonstrate that the Glu12–Asp24 region, and in particular the negatively charged residues Glu12, Asp13, and Asp15 in the hSR-A cytoplasmic domain, may be critical for hHK3 binding. Human SR-A Interacts with the C-terminal Region of hHK3—For the purpose of identifying the hHK3 region required for interaction with hSR-A, immunoprecipitations were performed using HEK293 cells transfected with hHK3 truncations. As shown in Fig. 2D, hSR-A clearly interacted with the N-terminal truncated form of hHK3 (ΔN-hHK3168–718), which lacks 1–167 amino acids of hHK3, consistent with the absence of these sequences in the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the C-terminal truncation (ΔC-hHK31–555) in which the C-terminal 556–718 amino acids are deleted failed to co-precipitate with hSR-A. These results indicate that the C-terminal region His556–Arg718 of hHK3 is required for the interaction with hSR-A. In this region, only amino acids Val614–Ala717 are shared between human HK3 and the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN. Taking into account the interaction of hSR-A with the rat HK3 isoform-ΔN, we concluded that the Val614–Ala717 region of hHK3 is the critical region for the binding to hSR-A. This conclusion seems to be consistent with the results obtained by yeast two-hybrid screening in which we could not find positive clones encoding the sequence of the rat HK3 isoform-ΔC. In the rat HK3 isoform-ΔC, the region corresponding to the Val614–Ala717 of hHK3 is absolutely absent. Furthermore, because the C terminus of hHK3 is positively charged, the binding of this region to the negatively charged residues of hSR-A is considered to be reasonable. Interaction between HK3 and SR-A Was Promoted by the Presence of an SR-A Ligand—We next examined whether the interaction between SR-A and HK3 was stimulated after SR-A had recognized extracellular ligands. HEK293 cells expressing hSR-A were incubated for the indicated periods with an SR-A ligand, fucoidan, and hSR-A was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by anti-V5-agarose. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amount of hHK3 co-sedimented with hSR-A was apparently increased after fucoidan was added to the cells. In contrast, the amount of hHK3 co-precipitated with hSR-A was not significantly changed after the cells were incubated with mannose (Fig. 3B). Re-probing the membrane with anti-V5 polyclonal antibody revealed that the amount of sedimented hSR-A was not significantly altered between the incubation periods. These results suggest that the association between hHK3 and hSR-A is significantly stimulated by ligand binding to hSR-A. Endogenous HK3 and SR-A Co-sediment from Murine Macrophage Cells—To confirm whether endogenous SR-A interacts with endogenous HK3, an immunoprecipitation assay was also performed using Raw264.7 murine macrophage cells. When endogenous murine SR-A was precipitated by rat anti-mouse SR-A monoclonal antibody 2F8 and probed with anti-HK3 antibody, endogenous murine HK3 was clearly detected (Fig. 4A). In contrast, control rat IgG did not precipitate HK3. These results suggest the interaction between endogenous HK3 and SR-A in macrophage cells, and indicate that SR-A binds to murine HK3 in addition to the rat HK3 isoform and human HK3.

https://openalex.org/W2055373451,"The V-ATPase H subunit (encoded by the <i>VMA13</i> gene) activates ATP-driven proton pumping in intact V-ATPase complexes and inhibits MgATPase activity in cytosolic V<sub>1</sub> sectors (Parra, K. J., Keenan, K. L., and Kane, P. M. (2000) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 275, 21761-21767). Yeast diploids heterozygous for a <i>vma13</i>Δ mutation show the pH- and calcium-dependent conditional lethality characteristic of mutants lacking V-ATPase activity, although they still contain one wild-type copy of <i>VMA13</i>. Vacuolar vesicles from this strain have ∼50% of the ATPase activity of those from a wild-type diploid but do not support formation of a proton gradient. Compound heterozygotes with a second heterozygous deletion in another V<sub>1</sub> subunit gene exhibit improved growth, vacuolar acidification, and ATP-driven proton transport in vacuolar vesicles. In contrast, compound heterozygotes with a second deletion in a V<sub>o</sub> subunit grow even more poorly than the <i>vma13</i>Δ heterozygote, have very little vacuolar acidification, and have very low levels of V-ATPase subunits in isolated vacuoles. In addition, cytosolic V<sub>1</sub> sectors from this strain and from the strain containing only the heterozygous <i>vma13</i>Δ mutation have elevated MgATPase activity. The results suggest that balancing levels of subunit H with those of other V-ATPase subunits is critical, both for allowing organelle acidification and for preventing unproductive hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2128133310,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains in its proteome at least three prion proteins. These proteins (Ure2p, Sup35p, and Rnq1p) share a set of remarkable properties. In vivo, they form aggregates that self-perpetuate their aggregation. This aggregation is controlled by Hsp104, which plays a major role in the growth and severing of these prions. In vitro, these prion proteins form amyloid fibrils spontaneously. The introduction of such fibrils made from Ure2p or Sup35p into yeast cells leads to the prion phenotypes [URE3] and [PSI], respectively. Previous studies on evolutionary biology of yeast prions have clearly established that [URE3] is not well conserved in the hemiascomycetous yeasts and particularly in S. paradoxus. Here we demonstrated that the S. paradoxus Ure2p is able to form infectious amyloid. These fibrils are more resistant than S. cerevisiae Ure2p fibrils to shear force. The observation, in vivo, of a distinct aggregation pattern for GFP fusions confirms the higher propensity of SpUre2p to form fibrillar structures. Our in vitro and in vivo analysis of aggregation propensity of the S. paradoxus Ure2p provides an explanation for its loss of infective properties and suggests that this protein belongs to the non-prion amyloid world."
