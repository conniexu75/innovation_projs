https://openalex.org/W2180639117,"We investigated the impact of the deletions of genes from the final steps in the biosynthesis of ergosterol (ERG6, ERG2, ERG3, ERG5, ERG4) on the physiological function of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane by a combination of biological tests and the diS-C3(3) fluorescence assay. Most of the erg mutants were more sensitive than the wild type to salt stress or cationic drugs, their susceptibilities were proportional to the hyperpolarization of their plasma membranes. The different sterol composition of the plasma membrane played an important role in the short-term and long-term processes that accompanied the exposure of erg strains to a hyperosmotic stress (effect on cell size, pH homeostasis and survival of yeasts), as well as in the resistance of cells to antifungal drugs. The pleiotropic drug-sensitive phenotypes of erg strains were, to a large extent, a result of the reduced efficiency of the Pdr5 efflux pump, which was shown to be more sensitive to the sterol content of the plasma membrane than Snq2p. In summary, the erg4Δ and erg6Δ mutants exhibited the most compromised phenotypes. As Erg6p is not involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, it may become a target for a new generation of antifungal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2197479270,"During the last years DNA barcoding has become a popular method of choice for molecular specimen identification. Here we present a comprehensive DNA barcode library of various crustacean taxa found in the North Sea, one of the most extensively studied marine regions of the world. Our data set includes 1,332 barcodes covering 205 species, including taxa of the Amphipoda, Copepoda, Decapoda, Isopoda, Thecostraca, and others. This dataset represents the most extensive DNA barcode library of the Crustacea in terms of species number to date. By using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), unique BINs were identified for 198 (96.6%) of the analyzed species. Six species were characterized by two BINs (2.9%), and three BINs were found for the amphipod species Gammarus salinus Spooner, 1947 (0.4%). Intraspecific distances with values higher than 2.2% were revealed for 13 species (6.3%). Exceptionally high distances of up to 14.87% between two distinct but monophyletic clusters were found for the parasitic copepod Caligus elongatus Nordmann, 1832, supporting the results of previous studies that indicated the existence of an overlooked sea louse species. In contrast to these high distances, haplotype-sharing was observed for two decapod spider crab species, Macropodia parva Van Noort & Adema, 1985 and Macropodia rostrata (Linnaeus, 1761), underlining the need for a taxonomic revision of both species. Summarizing the results, our study confirms the application of DNA barcodes as highly effective identification system for the analyzed marine crustaceans of the North Sea and represents an important milestone for modern biodiversity assessment studies using barcode sequences."

Here, we demonstrate that impairment of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by rotenone primes NLRP3 inflammasome activation only upon costimulation with ATP and not with nigericin or alum. Rotenone-induced priming of NLRP3 in the presence of ATP triggered the formation of specklike NLRP3 or ASC aggregates and the association of NLRP3 with ASC, resulting in NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation. Mechanistically, rotenone confers a priming signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation only in the context of aberrant high-grade, but not low-grade, mROS production and mitochondrial hyperpolarization. By contrast, rotenone/ATP-mediated mtDNA release and mitochondrial depolarization are likely to be merely an indication of mitochondrial damage rather than triggering factors for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

https://openalex.org/W2176258152,"The deubiquitinase (DUB) and tumor suppressor BAP1 catalyzes ubiquitin removal from histone H2A Lys-119 and coordinates cell proliferation, but how BAP1 partners modulate its function remains poorly understood. Here, we report that BAP1 forms two mutually exclusive complexes with the transcriptional regulators ASXL1 and ASXL2, which are necessary for maintaining proper protein levels of this DUB. Conversely, BAP1 is essential for maintaining ASXL2, but not ASXL1, protein stability. Notably, cancer-associated loss of BAP1 expression results in ASXL2 destabilization and hence loss of its function. ASXL1 and ASXL2 use their ASXM domains to interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of BAP1, and these interactions are required for ubiquitin binding and H2A deubiquitination. The deubiquitination-promoting effect of ASXM requires intramolecular interactions between catalytic and non-catalytic domains of BAP1, which generate a composite ubiquitin-binding interface (CUBI). Notably, the CUBI engages multiple interactions with ubiquitin involving (i) the ubiquitin carboxyl hydrolase catalytic domain of BAP1, which interacts with the hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin, and (ii) the CTD domain, which interacts with a charged patch of ubiquitin. Significantly, we identified cancer-associated mutations of BAP1 that disrupt the CUBI and notably an in-frame deletion in the CTD that inhibits its interaction with ASXL1/2 and DUB activity and deregulates cell proliferation. Moreover, we demonstrated that BAP1 interaction with ASXL2 regulates cell senescence and that ASXL2 cancer-associated mutations disrupt BAP1 DUB activity. Thus, inactivation of the BAP1/ASXL2 axis might contribute to cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2177028599,"Functional and deep sequencing studies have combined to demonstrate the involvement of APOBEC3B in cancer mutagenesis. APOBEC3B is a single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase that functions normally as a nuclear-localized restriction factor of DNA-based pathogens. However, it is overexpressed in cancer cells and elicits an intrinsic preference for 5′-TC motifs in single-stranded DNA, which is the most frequently mutated dinucleotide in breast, head/neck, lung, bladder, cervical, and several other tumor types. In many cases, APOBEC3B mutagenesis accounts for the majority of both dispersed and clustered (kataegis) cytosine mutations. Here, we report the first structures of the APOBEC3B catalytic domain in multiple crystal forms. These structures reveal a tightly closed active site conformation and suggest that substrate accessibility is regulated by adjacent flexible loops. Residues important for catalysis are identified by mutation analyses, and the results provide insights into the mechanism of target site selection. We also report a nucleotide (dCMP)-bound crystal structure that informs a multistep model for binding single-stranded DNA. Overall, these high resolution crystal structures provide a framework for further mechanistic studies and the development of novel anti-cancer drugs to inhibit this enzyme, dampen tumor evolution, and minimize adverse outcomes such as drug resistance and metastasis.

Seven APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes, A3A/B/C/D/F/G/H, encoded by a tandem gene array on human chromosome 22 provide overlapping protection against a variety of DNA-based parasites including viruses and transposable elements (reviewed in Refs. 3.Harris R.S.

A3B is the only family member that is predominantly nuclear through the duration of the cell cycle, except in the M phase, in which it is excluded from metaphase chromosomes, and after cell division and formation of daughter cell nuclei, it is then actively reimported to the nuclear compartment (5.Bogerd H.P.

Two related enzymes shuttle transiently into the nuclear compartment to reach biologically relevant nucleic acid substrates. Activation-induced deaminase (AID) is transported into the nucleus to deaminate immunoglobulin gene DNA and drive the antigen-driven processes of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation (reviewed in Refs. 7.Di Noia J.M.

Chromosome translocation, B cell lymphoma, and activation-induced cytidine deaminase.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2013; 8: 79-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). APOBEC1 shuttles into the nucleus to deaminate a variety of RNA substrates including cytosines in the coding region of mRNAs (such as the APOB mRNA), as well as a wide variety of noncoding regions (reviewed in Refs. 9.Fossat N.

A3B is thought to have retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral AID/APOBEC1 enzyme but lost the capacity to be exported actively into the cytoplasm from the nuclear compartment (11.Stenglein M.D. Matsuo H.

Taken together, these and other studies demonstrate that A3B is a significant endogenous source of genomic mutation in cancer, which promotes tumor evolution, heterogeneity, and poor clinical outcomes and is induced by some types of viral infection. Given this role in cancer mutagenesis, A3B has become a promising target for anti-cancer drug development. The attractiveness of A3B is further enhanced by the fact that it is a nonessential enzyme (28.Kidd J.M. Newman T.L. Tuzun E. Kaul R. Eichler E.E.

However, progress toward developing methods to inhibit A3B mutagenesis will require high resolution crystal structures, and to date, only homology models are possible because this enzyme has resisted structural determination (i.e. only structures of related human DNA deaminases have been reported (29.Bohn M.F.

Here we present multiple crystal structures of the A3B catalytic domain, including one bound by dCMP, which represents the first nucleotide-bound structure of any polynucleotide cytosine deaminase. These structures reveal an active site pocket occluded by loop regions, which highlights the importance of conformational flexibility in the ssDNA deamination mechanism. The bacterial expression plasmids used in this study were generated by inserting a codon-optimized gene for the full-length human A3B (residues 1–382) or A3B C-terminal domain (A3Bctd, residues 187–378) between the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pET24a vector (Novagen) for C-terminally His6-tagged proteins or between the BsaI/XbaI sites of the pE-SUMO vector (Lifesensors) for the N-terminally SUMO-tagged proteins. The A3B protein sequence used in this study matches UniProt ID Q9UH17. Derivatives encoding amino acid substitution mutants such as the quadruple mutant (QM) of A3Bctd were constructed by standard site-directed mutagenesis procedures and verified by DNA sequencing (University of Minnesota Genomics Center). A3Bctd-QM (F200S/W228S/L230K/F308K), A3Bctd-QMΔloop3, and its variant A3Bctd-QMΔloop3-A3Aloop1 were expressed with a noncleavable C-terminal His6 tag (LEHHHHHH) using the pET24a-based expression vector in Escherichia coli strain C43(DE3)pLysS. A3Bctd-DM (L230K/F308K) was expressed as a SUMO fusion. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm into the E. coli culture in LB medium during the mid-log growth phase, supplemented by 100 μm of zinc chloride at the time of induction. E. coli were collected after ∼16 h of incubation at 18 °C and lysed by sonication, and soluble protein was purified by nickel affinity and Superdex 200 size exclusion chromatography. The purified proteins suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol produced single peak in size exclusion chromatography corresponding to a monomer (see “Results”). Additional zinc was not included in buffers during purification, but the purified protein contained a stoichiometric amount of zinc as confirmed by a colorimetric zinc quantification assay (Abcam). For A3Bctd-DM, the SUMO tag was removed by Ulp1 treatment prior to the size exclusion chromatography step. C-terminally myc-tagged APOBEC3A was expressed in 293T cells and purified as described (39.Li M. Shandilya S.M. Carpenter M.A. Rathore A. Brown W.L. Perkins A.L. Harki D.A. Solberg J. Hook D.J.

This study examined the association of two diet-quality scores, namely Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) and Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) with NAFLD prevalence. Apparently healthy Chinese adults (332 male, 465 female) aged 18 years or above were recruited through a population screening between 2008 and 2010 in a cross-sectional population-based study in Hong Kong. DQI-I and MDS, as well as major food group and nutrient intakes were calculated based on dietary data from a food frequency questionnaire. NAFLD was defined as intrahepatic triglyceride content at ≥5% by proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between each diet-quality score or dietary component and prevalent NAFLD with adjustment for potential lifestyle, metabolic and genetic factors. A total of 220 subjects (27.6%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. DQI-I but not MDS was associated with the prevalence of NAFLD. A 10-unit decrease in DQI-I was associated with 24% increase in the likelihood of having NAFLD in the age and sex adjusted model (95% CI: 1.06–1.45, p = 0.009), and the association remained significant when the model was further adjusted for other lifestyle factors, metabolic and genetic factors [OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.03–1.54), p = 0.027]. Multivariate regression analyses showed an inverse association of the intake of vegetables and legumes, fruits and dried fruits, as well as vitamin C with the NAFLD prevalence (p<0.05). In conclusion, a better diet quality as characterized by a higher DQI-I and a higher consumption of vegetables, legumes and fruits was associated with a reduced likelihood of having NAFLD in Hong Kong Chinese."

M.vastus lateralis fiber cross sectional area (CSA) and proportion, knee-flexor/extensor strength, body composition, maximal endurance capacity and self-reported physical activity levels were assessed before and after 12 weeks.Compared to SED, 12 weeks of high intensity exercise increased mean fiber CSA (HITR: +21 ± 7%, HCTR: +23 ± 5%). Furthermore, fiber type I CSA increased in HCTR (+29 ± 6%), whereas type II (+23 ± 7%) and IIa (+23 ± 6%,) CSA increased in HITR. Muscle strength improved in HITR and HCTR (between +13 ± 7% and +45 ± 20%) and body fat percentage tended to decrease (HITR: -3.9 ± 2.0% and HCTR: -2.5 ± 1.2%). Furthermore, endurance capacity (Wmax +21 ± 4%, time to exhaustion +24 ± 5%, VO2max +17 ± 5%) and lean tissue mass (+1.4 ± 0.5%) only increased in HITR.

https://openalex.org/W2223046860,"The increasing prevalence of social networks provides researchers greater opportunities to evaluate and assess changes in public opinion and public sentiment towards issues of social consequence. Using trend and sentiment analysis is one method whereby researchers can identify changes in public perception that can be used to enhance the development of a social consciousness towards a specific public interest. The following study assessed Relative search volume (RSV) patterns for global warming (GW) and Climate change (CC) to determine public knowledge and awareness of these terms. In conjunction with this, the researchers looked at the sentiment connected to these terms in social media networks. It was found that there was a relationship between the awareness of the information and the amount of publicity generated around the terminology. Furthermore, the primary driver for the increase in awareness was an increase in publicity in either a positive or a negative light. Sentiment analysis further confirmed that the primary emotive connections to the words were derived from the original context in which the word was framed. Thus having awareness or knowledge of a topic is strongly related to its public exposure in the media, and the emotional context of this relationship is dependent on the context in which the relationship was originally established. This has value in fields like conservation, law enforcement, or other fields where the practice can and often does have two very strong emotive responses based on the context of the problems being examined."
https://openalex.org/W2225625486,"Light is a non-invasive tool that is widely used in a range of biomedical applications. Techniques such as photopolymerization, photodegradation, and photouncaging can be used to alter the chemical and physical properties of biomaterials in the presence of live cells. Long-wave UV light (315 nm-400 nm) is an easily accessible and commonly used energy source for triggering biomaterial changes. Although exposure to low doses of long-wave UV light is generally accepted as biocompatible, most studies employing this wavelength only establish cell viability, ignoring other possible (non-toxic) effects. Since light exposure of wavelengths longer than 315 nm may potentially induce changes in cell behavior, we examined changes in gene expression of human mesenchymal stem cells exposed to light under both 2D and 3D culture conditions, including two different hydrogel fabrication techniques, decoupling UV exposure and radical generation. While exposure to long-wave UV light did not induce significant changes in gene expression regardless of culture conditions, significant changes were observed due to scaffold fabrication chemistry and between cells plated in 2D versus encapsulated in 3D scaffolds. In order to facilitate others in searching for more specific changes between the many conditions, the full data set is available on Gene Expression Omnibus for querying."
https://openalex.org/W2194833942,"This study aimed to determine the long term effects of resolution of SDB in preschool children, either following treatment or spontaneous recovery, on cognition and behavior. Children diagnosed with SDB at 3-5y (N = 35) and non-snoring controls (N = 25), underwent repeat polysomnography (PSG) and cognitive and behavioral assessment 3 years following a baseline study. At follow-up, children with SDB were grouped into Resolved and Unresolved. Resolution was defined as: obstructive apnea hypopnea index (OAHI) ≤1 event/h; no snoring detected on PSG; and no parental report of habitual snoring. 57% (20/35) of children with SDB received treatment, with SDB resolving in 60% (12/20). 43% (15/35) were untreated, of whom 40% (6/15) had spontaneous resolution of SDB. Cognitive reduced between baseline and follow-up, however this was not related to persistent disease, with no difference in cognitive outcomes between Resolved, Unresolved or Control groups. Behavioral functioning remained significantly worse in children originally diagnosed with SDB compared to control children, regardless of resolution. Change in OAHI did not predict cognitive or behavioral outcomes, however a reduction in nocturnal arousals, irrespective of full resolution, was associated with improvement in attention and aggressive behavior. These results suggest that resolution of SDB in preschool children has little effect on cognitive or behavioral outcomes over the long term. The association between sleep fragmentation and behavior appears independent of SDB, however may be moderated by concomitant SDB. This challenges the assumption that treatment of SDB will ameliorate associated cognitive and behavioural deficits and supports the possibility of a SDB phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2212296938,"Anticoagulant rodenticides (ARs) are commonly used to control rodent infestations for biocidal and plant protection purposes. This can lead to AR exposure of non-target small mammals and their predators, which is known from several regions of the world. However, drivers of exposure variation are usually not known. To identify environmental drivers of AR exposure in non-targets we analyzed 331 liver samples of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) for residues of eight ARs and used local parameters (percentage of urban area and livestock density) to test for associations to residue occurrence. 59.8% of samples collected across Germany contained at least one rodenticide, in 20.2% of cases at levels at which biological effects are suspected. Second generation anticoagulants (mainly brodifacoum and bromadiolone) occurred more often than first generation anticoagulants. Local livestock density and the percentage of urban area were good indicators for AR residue occurrence. There was a positive association between pooled ARs and brodifacoum occurrence with livestock density as well as of pooled ARs, brodifacoum and difenacoum occurrence with the percentage of urban area on administrative district level. Pig holding drove associations of livestock density to AR residue occurrence in foxes. Therefore, risk mitigation strategies should focus on areas of high pig density and on highly urbanized areas to minimize non-target risk."
https://openalex.org/W2310161667,"Hyperglycemia in diabetic mothers enhances the risk of fetal cardiac hypertrophy during gestation. However, the mechanism of high-glucose-induced cardiac hypertrophy is not largely understood. In this study, we first demonstrated that the incidence rate of cardiac hypertrophy dramatically increased in fetuses of diabetic mothers using color ultrasound examination. In addition, human fetal cardiac hypertrophy was successfully mimicked in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes mouse model, in which mouse cardiac hypertrophy was diagnosed using type-M ultrasound and a histological assay. PH3 immunofluorescent staining of mouse fetal hearts and in vitro-cultured H9c2 cells indicated that cell proliferation decreased in E18.5, E15.5 and E13.5 mice, and cell apoptosis in H9c2 cells increased in the presence of high glucose in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we found that the individual cardiomyocyte size increased in pre-gestational diabetes mellitus mice and in response to high glucose exposure. Meanwhile, the expression of β-MHC and BMP-10 was up-regulated. Nkx2.5 immunofluorescent staining showed that the expression of Nkx2.5, a crucial cardiac transcription factor, was suppressed in the ventricular septum, left ventricular wall and right ventricular wall of E18.5, E15.5 and E13.5 mouse hearts. However, cardiac hypertrophy did not morphologically occur in E13.5 mouse hearts. In cultured H9c2 cells exposed to high glucose, Nkx2.5 expression decreased, as detected by both immunostaining and western blotting, and the expression of KCNE1 and Cx43 was also restricted. Taken together, alterations in cell size rather than cell proliferation or apoptosis are responsible for hyperglycemia-induced fetal cardiac hypertrophy. The aberrant expression of Nkx2.5 and its regulatory target genes in the presence of high glucose could be a principal component of pathogenesis in the development of fetal cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2274449307,"In this study, 796 male Duroc pigs were used to identify genomic regions controlling growth traits. Three production traits were studied: food conversion ratio, days to 100 KG, and average daily gain, using a panel of 39,436 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In total, we detected 11 genome-wide and 162 chromosome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism trait associations. The Gene ontology analysis identified 14 candidate genes close to significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, with growth-related functions: six for days to 100 KG (WT1, FBXO3, DOCK7, PPP3CA, AGPAT9, and NKX6-1), seven for food conversion ratio (MAP2, TBX15, IVL, ARL15, CPS1, VWC2L, and VAV3), and one for average daily gain (COL27A1). Gene ontology analysis indicated that most of the candidate genes are involved in muscle, fat, bone or nervous system development, nutrient absorption, and metabolism, which are all either directly or indirectly related to growth traits in pigs. Additionally, we found four haplotype blocks composed of suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the growth trait-related quantitative trait loci and further narrowed down the ranges, the largest of which decreased by ~60 Mb. Hence, our results could be used to improve pig production traits by increasing the frequency of favorable alleles via artificial selection."
https://openalex.org/W2194206932,"The platelet receptor CLEC-2 is involved in thrombosis/hemostasis, but its ligand, podoplanin, is expressed only in advanced atherosclerotic lesions. We investigated CLEC-2 ligands in vessel walls. Recombinant CLEC-2 bound to early atherosclerotic lesions and normal arterial walls, co-localizing with vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry showed that recombinant CLEC-2, but not an anti-podoplanin antibody, bound to VSMCs, suggesting that CLEC-2 ligands other than podoplanin are present in VSMCs. VSMCs stimulated platelet granule release and supported thrombus formation under flow, dependent on CLEC-2. The time to occlusion in a FeCl3-induced animal thrombosis model was significantly prolonged in the absence of CLEC-2. Because the internal elastic lamina was lacerated in our FeCl3-induced model, we assume that the interaction between CLEC-2 and its ligands in VSMCs induces thrombus formation. Protein arrays and Biacore analysis were used to identify S100A13 as a CLEC-2 ligand in VSMCs. However, S100A13 is not responsible for the above-described VSMC-induced platelet activation, because S100A13 is not expressed on the surface of normal VSMCs. S100A13 was released upon oxidative stress and expressed in the luminal area of atherosclerotic lesions. Suspended S100A13 did not activate platelets, but immobilized S100A13 significantly increased thrombus formation on collagen-coated surfaces. Taken together, we proposed that VSMCs stimulate platelets through CLEC-2, possibly leading to thrombus formation after plaque erosion and stent implantation, where VSMCs are exposed to blood flow. Furthermore, we identified S100A13 as one of the ligands on VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2337222712,"Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an important pathogen of numerous crops in the North Central region of the United States. The objective of this study was to examine the genetic diversity of 145 isolates of the pathogen from multiple hosts in the region. Mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) and microsatellite haplotypes were determined and analyzed for standard estimates of population genetic diversity and the importance of host and distance for genetic variation was examined. MCG tests indicated there were 49 different MCGs in the population and 52 unique microsatellite haplotypes were identified. There was an association between MCG and haplotype such that isolates belonging to the same MCG either shared identical haplotypes or differed at no more than 2 of the 12 polymorphic loci. For the majority of isolates, there was a one-to-one correspondence between MCG and haplotype. Eleven MCGs shared haplotypes. A single haplotype was found to be prevalent throughout the region. The majority of genetic variation in the isolate collection was found within rather than among host crops, suggesting little genetic divergence of S. sclerotiorum among hosts. There was only weak evidence of isolation by distance. Pairwise population comparisons among isolates from canola, dry bean, soybean and sunflower suggested that gene flow between host-populations is more common for some crops than others. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium in the isolates from the four major crops indicated primarily clonal reproduction, but also evidence of genetic recombination for isolates from canola and sunflower. Accordingly, genetic diversity was highest for populations from canola and sunflower. Distribution of microsatellite haplotypes across the study region strongly suggest that specific haplotypes of S. sclerotiorum are often found on multiple crops, movement of individual haplotypes among crops is common and host identity is not a barrier to gene flow for S. sclerotiorum in the north central United States."
https://openalex.org/W2261134323,"Human bocaviruses (HBoVs) 1-4 are recently discovered, antigenically similar parvoviruses. We examined the hypothesis that the antigenic similarity of these viruses could give rise to clinically and diagnostically important immunological interactions. IgG and IgM EIAs as well as qPCR were used to study ~2000 sera collected from infancy to early adolescence at 3-6-month intervals from 109 children whose symptoms were recorded. We found that HBoV1-4-specific seroprevalences at age 6 years were 80%, 48%, 10%, and 0%, respectively. HBoV1 infections resulted in significantly weaker IgG responses among children who had pre-existing HBoV2 IgG, and vice versa. Furthermore, we documented a complete absence of virus type-specific immune responses in six viremic children who had pre-existing IgG for another bocavirus, indicating that not all HBoV infections can be diagnosed serologically. Our results strongly indicate that interactions between consecutive HBoV infections affect HBoV immunity via a phenomenon called ""original antigenic sin"", cross-protection, or both; however, without evident clinical consequences but with important ramifications for the serodiagnosis of HBoV infections. Serological data is likely to underestimate human exposure to these viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2259367957,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) plays a critical role in the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells; however, the downstream signaling events underlying these processes remain poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the signaling pathways triggered by LPA to regulate the mechanisms involved in the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We have used three cell line models of CRC, and initially analyzed the expression profile of LPA receptors (LPAR). Then, we treated the cells with LPA and events related to their tumorigenic potential, such as migration, invasion, anchorage-independent growth, proliferation as well as apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated. We used the Chip array technique to analyze the global gene expression profiling that occurs after LPA treatment, and we identified cell signaling pathways related to the cell cycle. The inhibition of these pathways verified the conclusions of the transcriptomic analysis. We found that the cell lines expressed LPAR1, -2 and -3 in a differential manner and that 10 μM LPA did not affect cell migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth, but it did induce proliferation and cell cycle progression in HCT-116 cells. Although LPA in this concentration did not induce transcriptional activity of β-catenin, it promoted the activation of Rho and STAT-3. Moreover, ROCK and STAT-3 inhibitors prevented LPA-induced proliferation, but ROCK inhibition did not prevent STAT-3 activation. Finally, we observed that LPA regulates the expression of genes related to the cell cycle and that the combined inhibition of ROCK and STAT-3 prevented cell cycle progression and increased the LPA-induced expression of cyclins E1, A2 and B1 to a greater degree than either inhibitor alone. Overall, these results demonstrate that LPA increases the proliferative potential of colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 cells through a mechanism involving cooperation between the Rho-ROCK and STAT3 pathways involved in cell cycle control."
https://openalex.org/W2339616329,"Respiratory allergy triggered by pollen allergens is increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. Sunflower pollen is thought to be an important source of inhalant allergens. Present study aims to identify the prevalence of sunflower pollinosis among the Indian allergic population and characterizes the pollen allergens using immuno-proteomic tools.Clinico-immunological tests were performed to understand the prevalence of sensitivity towards sunflower pollen among the atopic population. Sera from selected sunflower positive patients were used as probe to detect the IgE-reactive proteins from the one and two dimensional electrophoretic separated proteome of sunflower pollen. The antigenic nature of the sugar moiety of the glycoallergens was studied by meta-periodate modification of IgE-immunoblot. Finally, these allergens were identified by mass-spectrometry.Prevalence of sunflower pollen sensitization was observed among 21% of the pollen allergic population and associated with elevated level of specific IgE and histamine in the sera of these patients. Immunoscreening of sunflower pollen proteome with patient sera detected seven IgE-reactive proteins with varying molecular weight and pI. Hierarchical clustering of 2D-immunoblot data highlighted three allergens characterized by a more frequent immuno-reactivity and increased levels of IgE antibodies in the sera of susceptible patients. These allergens were considered as the major allergens of sunflower pollen and were found to have their glycan moiety critical for inducing IgE response. Homology driven search of MS/MS data of these IgE-reactive proteins identified seven previously unreported allergens from sunflower pollen. Three major allergenic proteins were identified as two pectate lyases and a cysteine protease.Novelty of the present report is the identification of a panel of seven sunflower pollen allergens for the first time at immuno-biochemical and proteomic level, which substantiated the clinical evidence of sunflower allergy. Further purification and recombinant expression of these allergens will improve component-resolved diagnosis and therapy of pollen allergy."
https://openalex.org/W2175822856,"Gaucher disease is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide due to deficient activity of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (GBA). In cells, glucosylceramide is also degraded outside lysosomes by the enzyme glucosylceramidase 2 (GBA2) of which inherited deficiency is associated with ataxias. The interest in GBA and glucosylceramide metabolism in the brain has grown following the notion that mutations in the GBA gene impose a risk factor for motor disorders such as α-synucleinopathies. We earlier developed a β-glucopyranosyl-configured cyclophellitol-epoxide type activity based probe (ABP) allowing in vivo and in vitro visualization of active molecules of GBA with high spatial resolution. Labeling occurs through covalent linkage of the ABP to the catalytic nucleophile residue in the enzyme pocket. Here, we describe a method to visualize active GBA molecules in rat brain slices using in vivo labeling. Brain areas related to motor control, like the basal ganglia and motor related structures in the brainstem, show a high content of active GBA. We also developed a β-glucopyranosyl cyclophellitol-aziridine ABP allowing in situ labeling of GBA2. Labeled GBA2 in brain areas can be identified and quantified upon gel electrophoresis. The distribution of active GBA2 markedly differs from that of GBA, being highest in the cerebellar cortex. The histological findings with ABP labeling were confirmed by biochemical analysis of isolated brain areas. In conclusion, ABPs offer sensitive tools to visualize active GBA and to study the distribution of GBA2 in the brain and thus may find application to establish the role of these enzymes in neurodegenerative disease conditions such as α-synucleinopathies and cerebellar ataxia."

We have interpreted this observation, together with crystallographic studies, as evidence that Casq binds Ca2+ cooperatively, which explains both its greater oligomerization and greater Ca2+ binding capacity as Ca2+ concentrations increase. In vivo, inside the SR, Casq exists in linear ramified polymers, forming a dense network that fills the SR terminal cisternae (6.Perni S. Close M. Franzini-Armstrong C.

The structure of this network is entirely consistent with the lattice interactions observed in vitro (8.Sanchez E.J. Lewis K.M. Danna B.R. Kang C.

Polymerized in this way, Casq in living muscle appears to be in a state consistent with maximum storage capacity. Other structural details suggest roles for Casq in addition to Ca2+ storage (for a review, see Ref. 9.Royer L. Ríos E. Deconstructing calsequestrin. Complex buffering in the calcium store of skeletal muscle.J. Physiol. 2009; 587: 3101-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The polymeric network inside the SR ends with slender pillars or tendrils that lead to the junctional membrane near the mouth of the RyR channels (7.Boncompagni S. Thomas M. Lopez J.R. Allen P.D. Yuan Q. Kranias E.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. Perez C.F. Triadin/Junctin double null mouse reveals a differential role for Triadin and Junctin in anchoring CASQ to the jSR and regulating Ca2+ homeostasis.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e39962Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Casq1 binds between 40 and 60 mol of Ca2+/mol, but in past crystallographic studies only up to 17 Ca2+ ions were identified, the majority of which appeared to be loosely bound and consequently diffusible (8.Sanchez E.J. Lewis K.M. Danna B.R. Kang C. High-capacity Ca2+ binding of human skeletal calsequestrin.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 11592-11601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These features suggest that Casq polymers facilitate Ca2+ diffusion toward the open Ca2+ release channels both by increasing the local concentration of diffusible Ca2+ ions and by adding one-dimensional directionality down the polymer like a “calcium wire” (10.MacLennan D.H. Reithmeier R.A. Ion tamers.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11.Kang C. Trumble W.R. Dunker A.K. Crystallization and structure-function of calsequestrin.Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 172: 281-294PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism, a form of diffusion enhancement by reduction of dimensionality (12.Adam G. Delbrück M. Rich A. Davidson N. Structural Chemistry and Molecular Biology. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1968: 198-215Google Scholar), remains hypothetical. Finally, Casq appears to have a gating role, specifically operating in the termination of Ca2+ release. This termination, which is essential for rapid contractile relaxation, requires fast closing of SR Ca2+ release (RyR) channels. Some evidence indicates that Casq is required for adequate channel closure in skeletal muscle (13.Sztretye M. Yi J. Figueroa L. Zhou J. Royer L. Allen P. Brum G. Ríos E.

Physiol. 2012; 140: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Much of the interest in the properties of this protein stems from observations of linkage between its mutations and human disease (special cases of “couplonopathies” or diseases of the couplon (19.Ríos E. Figueroa L. Manno C. Kraeva N. Riazi S. The couplonopathies: a comparative approach to a class of diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 145: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). This association is especially clear in the heart where at least 15 Casq2 mutations have been linked with a disease known as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (for a review, see Ref. 16.Faggioni M. Kryshtal D.O. Knollmann B.C. Calsequestrin mutations and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.Pediatr. Cardiol. 2012; 33: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As for Casq1, its association with muscle disease rests on three observations. (i) A syndrome similar to malignant hyperthermia (MH) has been reported for Casq1-null mice (17.Dainese M. Quarta M. Lyfenko A.D. Paolini C. Canato M. Reggiani C. Dirksen R.T. Protasi F. Anesthetic- and heat-induced sudden death in calsequestrin-1-knockout mice.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18.Tomasi M. Canato M. Paolini C. Dainese M.

Cell Physiol. 2012; 302: C575-C586Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The causation of MH by Casq1 absence is consistent with the observations in cardiac muscle as both are mechanistically similar diseases of enhancement and loss of control of Ca2+ release (19.Ríos E. Figueroa L. Manno C. Kraeva N. Riazi S. The couplonopathies: a comparative approach to a class of diseases of skeletal and cardiac muscle.J. Gen. Physiol. 2015; 145: 459-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is, in most cases, associated with severe deficits in the amount of protein present (16.Faggioni M. Kryshtal D.O. Knollmann B.C. Calsequestrin mutations and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.Pediatr. Cardiol. 2012; 33: 959-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). (ii) A missense mutation, D244G, is linked to a myopathy characterized by the presence of vacuoles containing SR protein inclusions (20.Rossi D. Vezzani B. Galli L. Paolini C. Toniolo L. Pierantozzi E. Spinozzi S. Barone V. Pegoraro E. Bello L. Cenacchi G. Vattemi G. Tomelleri G. Ricci G. Siciliano G. Protasi F. Reggiani C. Sorrentino V. A mutation in the CASQ1 gene causes a vacuolar myopathy with accumulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum protein aggregates.Hum. Mutat. 2014; 35: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The patients experience muscle weakness, and their cells show altered Ca2+ dynamics. (iii) A second missense mutation, M87T, was found in 16 of 205 MH probands (21.Kraeva N. Zvaritch E. Frodis W. Sizova O. Kraev A. MacLennan D.H. Riazi S. CASQ1 gene is an unlikely candidate for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in the North American population.Anesthesiology. 2013; 118: 344-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M87T could not be formally linked to MH (it is clinically called a variant, rather than a mutation, and that is the term we use here), but a mild association of mutation and disease was found (with an odds ratio of ∼2). Additionally, this mutation occurred in patients also carrying a MH-causative mutation of RyR1 at an unexpectedly high frequency. Although the M87T mutation appears to cause mild malfunction per se, it might contribute to the disease phenotype when associated to RyR mutations. M87T also has relevance in the context of its polymerization-dependent Ca2+ storage functions as replacing the highly conserved Met-87 by Thr at the dimer interface should hamper dimerization (21.Kraeva N. Zvaritch E. Frodis W. Sizova O. Kraev A. MacLennan D.H. Riazi S. CASQ1 gene is an unlikely candidate for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in the North American population.Anesthesiology. 2013; 118: 344-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report the first structural and biophysical characterization of D244G and M87T hCasq1, compare them with wild type hCasq1, and propose mechanisms for how these mutations may contribute to the associated disease phenotypes. The D244G and M87T hCasq1 genes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type hCasq1 gene (GenBank accession number AB277764.1) in pET30a and transformed into Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells for protein expression. Rosetta(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli cells containing the Casq1 vectors were grown in LB media at 37 °C, and overexpression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside after reaching an A600 of 0.6. Following induction, the cells were harvested; suspended in 20 mm Tris, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 7.5; and sonicated at 8000 rpm using a 450 Sonifier® (Branson Ultrasonics) until they reached apparent homogeneity. The resulting lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and loaded onto a Toyopearl DEAE-650 M (Tosoh Biosciences) column equilibrated with DEAE wash buffer (20 mm Tris, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 7.5). hCasq1 eluted between a linear gradient of 12.5 and 25% DEAE elution buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 m NaCl, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 7.5). DEAE fractions containing hCasq1 were then purified using a CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with hydroxyapatite wash buffer (5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 6.8). hCasq1 eluted between a gradient of 50 and 100% hydroxyapatite elution buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 6.8). Finally, hydroxyapatite fractions containing purified hCasq1 were purified using a phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high substitution column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with phenyl-Sepharose wash buffer (20 mm MOPS, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, 1 mm EGTA). After extensive washing, hCasq1 was eluted from the column using wash buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2. Fractions containing hCasq1 were then buffer-exchanged into Casq assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, 0.3 m KCl, 0.05 g/100 ml, pH 7.2). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific). Wild type, D244G, and M87T hCasq1 (12.5 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 g/100 ml NaN3, pH 7.0) were crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C. For wild type and M87T, 1.5 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1.5 μl of crystallization buffer (0.1 m HEPES, 0.2 m NaCl, 27.5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, pH 7.0), whereas for D244G, 1.25 μl of protein solution was mixed with 1.75 μl of crystallization buffer to obtain the low Ca2+ form. Crystals generally formed within 1 week. In the case of M87T, crystals grew from protein incubated with 5 mm CaCl2 prior to mixing with crystallization solution. High Ca2+ D244G crystals were obtained by slowly diffusing 10 mm CaCl2 across a semipermeable membrane to D244G over the course of 24 h. Crystallographic data were collected at the Advanced Light Source Beamline 8.2.1 and reduced and scaled using HKL2000 (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Processing of x-ray diffraction data collected in oscillation mode.Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38565) Google Scholar). The low Ca2+ wild type hCasq1 structure was solved by molecular replacement using PHENIX with native rabbit Casq1 (Protein Data Bank code 3TRQ) as an input model. The D244G and M87T structures were then solved by molecular replacement using the low Ca2+ wild type hCasq1 structure as the input model. The high Ca2+ forms were built manually as necessary. Iterative model adjustment and refinement were completed using Coot (23.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

For descriptive purposes, the A350 as a function of Ca2+ concentration was least square-fitted to the sum of two Boltzmann functions, namely Equation 1. y = y 0 + ( A 1 1 + e x − x 01 k 1 ) + ( A 2 1 + e x − x 02 k 2 ) (Eq. 1) where y is A350, x is the Ca2+ concentration, y0 is the initial value, A1 and A2 are the spans of the absorbance changes, x01 and x02 are the centers of the first and second transitions, and k1 and k2 are the first and second slope factors, respectively. For equilibrium dialysis cells, two adjoined 1.4-ml acrylic half-cells separated by a 4.0-cm2 circular regenerated cellulose dialysis membrane (12–14-kDa cutoff) were used. For each cell, 0.5-ml aliquots of either 10 μm wild type, D244G, or M87T hCasq1 in Casq assay buffer were added to one half-cell, and solutions of varying CaCl2 concentrations in Casq assay buffer were added to the other. The two solutions within each cell equilibrated for 3 days at room temperature on a rocking shaker. After equilibration, the 317.933 nm Ca2+ emission intensity of each sample was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Optima 3200 RL inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. The difference between the Ca2+ contained within the protein-containing and protein-free sides of a given cell determined the bound Ca2+ (i.e. Ca2+(protein) − Ca2+(no protein) = ΔCa2+), which, when divided by its corresponding moles of protein, gave the fractional occupancy. The vertical bars at each point are standard deviations of three independent measurements. The fractional occupancies versus their corresponding free Ca2+ concentrations were least square-fitted to the sum of two Hill equations. f = B max , 1 ( [ C a 2 + ] n 1 [ C a 2 + ] n 1 + K d 1 n 1 ) + B max , 2 ( [ C a 2 + ] n 2 [ C a 2 + ] n 2 + K d 1 n 2 ) (Eq. 2) where f is fractional occupancy, Bmaxj (with j = 1 or 2) are the maxima of the two binding components, Kdj are their corresponding dissociation constants, and nj are their Hill coefficients. The structures of wild type human, low Ca2+ D244G, and high Ca2+ D244G Casq1 were prepared for quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations using the PDB Prep Wizard in Schrödinger Maestro (24.Schrödinger, LLC Schrödinger Suite 2015-2 Protein Preparation Wizard; Maestro.

The B3LYP level of theory with double ζ correlation-consistent basis sets (cc-pVDZ for hydrogen and carbon, aug-cc-pVDZ for nitrogen and oxygen, and cc-pwCVDZ for Ca2+) was used for the high layer (26.Peterson K.A.

Single point calculations at the B3LYP level of theory with triple ζ basis sets (cc-pVTZ for hydrogen and carbon, aug-cc-pVTZ for nitrogen and oxygen, and cc-pwCVTZ for calcium) were then performed on each optimized structure. Self-consistent field total electron density and electrostatic potentials were generated from the single point calculation at 12 and six points per bohr, respectively. Electrostatic potential surfaces were generated by plotting the electrostatic potential on its corresponding electron density at an isovalue of 0.0200 electron/bohr3 in GaussView 3.09 (28.Frisch M. GaussView. Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford, CT2004Google Scholar). We compared the Ca2+-dependent polymerization properties of the wild type protein and two mutants by light scattering and turbidity measurements. We also compared their equilibrium Ca2+ binding properties as well as their crystal structures obtained with or without Ca2+ in the medium. The size exclusion chromatography profiles of wild type, D244G, and M87T hCasq1 (Fig. 1) show that the three proteins are all monomers in 0 mm Ca2+ buffer (Fig. 1A) and have roughly the same response to rising Ca2+ concentrations at 1.0 and 1.5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1, B and C). There appeared to be a small presence of wild type and D244G Casq1 tetramers at 1.5 mm Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, inset); because of the low absorbance of each peak (implying a very small amount of protein in this state), the significance of this observation is not clear. Above 1.5 mm Ca2+, monitoring Ca2+-dependent polymerization of Casq1 by multiangle light scattering was not possible because the higher order Casq1 polymers clogged the column matrix. To circumvent these limitations, Casq1 aggregation beyond 1.5 mm Ca2+ was monitored by turbidity assays. Wild type hCasq1 (Fig. 2, solid line) started a major transition at 1.4 mm Ca2+ and became saturated by 9 mm Ca2+ with an absorbance of 0.2. D244G (dotted line) underwent a large increase in turbidity that started at 1.4 mm Ca2+ and ended at 4.4 mm Ca2+ with a final absorbance of 1.0. The increase in absorbance for M87T (dashed line) was substantially lower than that of wild type and D244G. Expecting to enhance the response, M87T was studied at 2.0 and 4.0 mg/ml (Fig. 2, filled and open squares, respectively). The 4.0 mg/ml solution attained a maximum turbidity 2.8 times higher than the 2.0 mg/ml maxima, but both still required high Ca2+ concentrations to become turbid, and neither became as turbid as wild type. Equilibrium Ca2+ binding curves calculated from equilibrium dialysis/inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry data are shown in Fig. 3. The binding data were fit to the sum of two “Hill” functions (Equation 2).

Open table in a new tab Each curve features two distinct binding stages with roughly sigmoidal Ca2+ concentration dependence. The mutants have lower Ca2+ binding capacity, and in both cases, the second binding stage occurs at a greater Ca2+ concentration than for wild type. In all cases, the second binding stage has a higher Kd than the first stage and, most notably, a very high Hill coefficient, which is suggestive of high cooperativity in this stage. Although each Casq1 features the two-stage binding property, the high Ca2+ high cooperativity component is most prominent in wild type and decays in size (i.e. Bmax2) for both mutants, especially D244G. Both mutants also have a greater Kd2 and a much greater Hill coefficient of the second component (the one with highest cooperativity).

https://openalex.org/W2146392597,"Introduction Cholera, an infectious diarrheal disease, has been shown to be associated with large scale hydroclimatic processes. The sudden and sporadic occurrence of epidemic cholera is linked with high mortality rates, in part, due to uncertainty in timing and location of outbreaks. Improved understanding of the relationship between pathogenic abundance and climatic processes allows prediction of disease outbreak to be an achievable goal. In this study, we show association of large scale hydroclimatic processes with the cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe reported to have begun in Chitungwiza, a city in Mashonaland East province, in August, 2008. Principal Findings Climatic factors in the region were found to be associated with triggering cholera outbreak and are shown to be related to anomalies of temperature and precipitation, validating the hypothesis that poor conditions of sanitation, coupled with elevated temperatures, and followed by heavy rainfall can initiate outbreaks of cholera. Spatial estimation by satellite of precipitation and global gridded air temperature captured sensitivities in hydroclimatic conditions that permitted identification of the location in the region where the disease outbreak began. Discussion Satellite derived hydroclimatic processes can be used to capture environmental conditions related to epidemic cholera, as occurred in Zimbabwe, thereby providing an early warning system. Since cholera cannot be eradicated because the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, is autochthonous to the aquatic environment, prediction of conditions favorable for its growth and estimation of risks of triggering the disease in a given population can be used to alert responders, potentially decreasing infection and saving lives."
https://openalex.org/W2162112074,"Silk proteins are synthesized in the middle and posterior silk glands of silkworms, then transit into the anterior of the silk gland, where the silk fibers are produced, stored and processed. The mechanism of formation and spinning of the silk fibers has not been fully elucidated, and transcriptome analyses specific to the anterior silk gland have not been reported. In the present study, we explored gene expression profiles in five regions of silk gland samples using the RNA-Seq method. As a result, there were 959,979,570 raw reads obtained, of which 583,068,172 reads were mapped to the silkworm genome. A total of 7419 genes were found to be expressed in terms of reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads ≥ 5 in at least one sample. The gene numbers and expression levels of the expressed genes differed between these regions. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed, and 282 genes were detected as up-regulated in the anterior silk gland, compared with the other parts. Functions of these genes were addressed using the gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases, and seven key pathways were enriched. It suggested that the ion transportation, energy metabolism, protease inhibitors and cuticle proteins played essential roles in the process of silk formation and spinning in the anterior silk gland. In addition, 210 genes were found differently expressed between males and females, which should help to elucidate the mechanism of the quality difference in silk fibers from male and female silkworms."

The aim of this study is to ascertain cross-sectionally and longitudinally the specific contribution of CU levels and the presence of ODD in the psychological state of preschool children from the general population. A total of 622 children were assessed longitudinally at ages 3 and 5 with a semi-structured diagnostic interview and questionnaires filled out by parents and teachers. In multivariate models simultaneously including ODD diagnosis and CU levels, controlling by socioeconomic status, ethnicity, sex, severity of conduct disorder symptoms and other comorbidity, high CU scores were related to higher levels of aggression, withdrawn, externalizing and global symptomatology, functional impairment and higher probability of comorbid disorders and use of services. The contribution of CU traits on children's psychological state was not moderated by the presence/absence of ODD. Stability for CU traits and number of ODD-symptoms between ages 3 and 5 was statistically significant but moderate-low (intra-class correlation under .40). Assessment and identification of CU traits from preschool might help to identify a subset of children who could have socialization problems, not only among those with ODD but also among those without a diagnosis of conduct problems."
https://openalex.org/W2257680416,"Background 
Parasitic helminths need to suppress the host immune system to establish chronic infections. Paradoxically, immunosuppression induced by the worm also benefits the host by limiting excessive inflammation and tissue damage, which remains the major cause leading to serious morbidity and mortality. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are key immune regulators of this mutualism. The successive rise in Tregs during schistosome infection plays a critical role in immunoregulation. We and others previously showed that Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) egg antigens (SEA) induce Tregs both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we identified that SjHSP60 derived from SEA significantly induces Tregs in vivo and in vitro. However, the contribution of SjHSP60 in SEA to Treg induction and the related mechanisms of the Treg induction have not yet been identified.


Methodology/Principal Findings 
In this study, we showed that S. japonicum stress protein HSP60 (SjHSP60) was constitutively and extensively expressed in eggs of S. japonicum. SjHSP60 specially induced Tregs in vivo and in vitro without inducing other CD4+ T sub-populations including Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Furthermore, we showed that the SjHSP60-depleted SEA almost lost the ability in vitro and displayed a significant impaired ability to induce Tregs in vivo. Finally, our study illustrated that the mechanisms of SjHSP60-mediated induction of Tregs are through both conversion of CD4+CD25- T cells into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs and expansion of preexisting CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in a TLR4-dependent manner.


Conclusions/Significance 
Collectively, our findings identify SjHSP60 as a major parasitic contributor of Treg induction in S. japonicum egg antigens, which not only contributes to the better understanding of the mechanism of immunoregulation during helminth infection, but also suggests its potential as a therapeutic target for control of immunopathology, allergic and autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2272469972,"The virulent form of turkey adenovirus 3 (TAdV-3), also known as turkey hemorrhagic enteritis virus (THEV), is an economically important poultry pathogen, while the avirulent form is used as a vaccine. TAdV-3 belongs to the genus Siadenovirus. The carboxy-terminal region of its fibre does not have significant sequence similarity to any other adenovirus fibre heads of known structure. Two amino acid sequence differences between virulent and avirulent TAdV-3 map on the fibre head: where virulent TAdV-3 contains Ile354 and Thr376, avirulent TAdV-3 contains Met354 and Met376. We determined the crystal structures of the trimeric virulent and avirulent TAdV-3 fibre head domains at 2.2 Å resolution. Each monomer contains a beta-sandwich, which, surprisingly, resembles reovirus fibre head more than other adenovirus fibres, although the ABCJ-GHID topology is conserved in all. A beta-hairpin insertion in the C-strand of each trimer subunit embraces its neighbouring monomer. The avirulent and virulent TAdV-3 fibre heads are identical apart from the exact orientation of the beta-hairpin insertion. In vitro, sialyllactose was identified as a ligand by glycan microarray analysis, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and crystallography. Its dissociation constant was measured to be in the mM range by isothermal titration calorimetry. The ligand binds to the side of the fibre head, involving amino acids Glu392, Thr419, Val420, Lys421, Asn422, and Gly423 binding to the sialic acid group. It binds slightly more strongly to the avirulent form. We propose that, in vivo, the TAdV-3 fibre may bind a sialic acid-containing cell surface component."
https://openalex.org/W2268122434,"To invade and metastasize to distant loci, breast cancer cells must breach the layer of basement membrane surrounding the tumor and then invade through the dense collagen I-rich extracellular environment of breast tissue. Previous studies have shown that breast cancer cell aggregate morphology in basement membrane extract correlated with cell invasive capacity in some contexts. Moreover, cell lines from the same aggregate morphological class exhibited similarities in gene expression patterns. To further assess the capacity of cell and aggregate morphology to predict invasive capacity in physiologically relevant environments, six cell lines with varied cell aggregate morphologies were assessed in a variety of assays including a 3D multicellular invasion assay that recapitulates cell-cell and cell-environment contacts as they exist in vivo in the context of the primary breast tumor. Migratory and invasive capacities as measured through a 2D gap assay and a 3D spheroid invasion assay reveal that breast cancer cell aggregate morphology alone is insufficient to predict migratory speed in 2D or invasive capacity in 3D. Correlations between the 3D spheroid invasion assay and gene expression profiles suggest this assay as an inexpensive functional method to predict breast cancer invasive capacity."

Retrospective cohort analysis was performed on the data of all patients (≥3 months after transplantation and ≥16 years of age) admitted to the hospital due to medical or surgical complications from 2007 to 2010. We analyzed 458 kidney transplant recipients, 55.2% men, median age 49 (IQR, 36–58) years, median of 12.5 (IQR, 3–35) months after kidney transplantation; admitted to the hospital due to medical or surgical complications. Most of the patients received a kidney from a deceased donor (62.2%), the primary cause for hospital admission was infection (60.7%) and 57 (12.4%) individuals were diagnosed with acute rejection (AR). The incidence of AKI was 82.3%: 31.9% stage 1, 29.3% stage 2 and 21.2% stage 3. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR 8.90, 95% CI: 1.77–44.56 p = 0.008), infection (OR 5.73, 95% CI: 2.61–12.56, p<0.001) and the use of contrast media (OR 9.34, 95% CI: 2.04–42.70, p = 0.004) were the independent risk factors for AKI development. The mortality rate was 2.1% and all patients who died were diagnosed with AKI. Even after the exclusion of AR cases, at the end of 12 months, the individuals with AKI exhibited higher percent changes in creatinine values when compared with individuals without AKI (9.1% vs. -4.3%; p<0.001).

As in other scenarios, AKI was associated with renal function loss at 1-year after the hospital discharge."
https://openalex.org/W2191558232,"Binary definitions of the metabolic syndrome based on the presence of a particular number of individual risk factors are limited, particularly in the pediatric population. To address this limitation, we aimed at constructing composite and continuous metabolic syndrome scores (cmetS) to represent an overall measure of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a large cohort of metabolically at-risk children, focusing on the use of the usual clinical parameters (waist circumference (WC) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), supplemented with two salivary surrogate variables (glucose and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC). Two different approaches used to create the scores were evaluated in comparison.Data from 8,112 Kuwaiti children (10.00 ± 0.67 years) were used to construct two cmetS for each subject. The first cmetS (cmetS-Z) was created by summing standardized residuals of each variable regressed on age and gender; and the second cmetS (cmetS-PCA) was defined as the first principal component from gender-specific principal component analysis based on the four variables.There was a graded relationship between both scores and the number of adverse risk factors. The areas under the curve using cmetS-Z and cmetS-PCA as predictors for severe metabolic syndrome (defined as the presence of ≥3 metabolic risk factors) were 0.935 and 0.912, respectively. cmetS-Z was positively associated with WC, SBP, and glucose, but inversely associated with HDLC. Except for the lack of association with glucose, cmetS-PCA was similar to cmetS-Z in boys, but had minimum loading on HDLC in girls. Analysis using quantile regression showed an inverse association of fitness level with cmetS-PCA (p = 0.001 for boys; p = 0.002 for girls), and comparison of cmetS-Z and cmetS-PCA suggested that WC and SBP were main contributory components. Significant alterations in the relationship between cmetS and salivary adipocytokines were demonstrated in overweight and obese children as compared to underweight and normal-weight children.We have derived continuous summary scores for MetS from a large-scale pediatric study using two different approaches, incorporating salivary measures as surrogate for plasma measures. The derived scores were viable expressions of metabolic risk, and can be utilized to study the relationships of MetS with various aspects of the metabolic disease process."

The public attitude in China toward agricultural biotechnology and genetically modified (GM) crops and foods has received considerable attention worldwide. We investigated the attitudes of consumers, Bt cotton farmers and scientists in China regarding GM crops and foods and the factors influencing their attitudes. Data were collected using interview surveys of consumer households, farmer households and scientists. A discrete choice approach was used to elicit the purchase intentions of the respondents. Two separate probit models were developed to examine the effect of various factors on the choices of the respondents. Bt cotton farmers had a very positive attitude because Bt cotton provided them with significant economic benefits. Chinese consumers from developed regions had a higher acceptance and willingness to pay for GM foods than consumers in other regions. The positive attitude toward GM foods by the scientific community will help to promote biotechnology in China in the future. Our survey emphasized that educational efforts made by government officials, the media and scientists can facilitate the acceptance of GM technology in China. Further educational efforts will be critical for influencing consumer attitudes and decisions of government agencies in the future. More effective educational efforts by government agencies and public media concerning the scientific facts and safety of GM foods would enhance the acceptance of GM crops in China."

Objective To explore how the medical staff of ICUs in China comprehend and practice VTE prophylaxis. Method Questionnaires comprising 39 questions and including 4 dimensions of thromboprophylaxis were administered in ICUs in North China. Results In all, 52 ICUs at 23 tertiary hospitals in 7 Chinese provinces and municipalities were surveyed. A total of 2500 questionnaires were sent, and 1861 were returned, corresponding to a response rate of approximately 74.4%. Of all surveyed medical staff, 36.5% of physicians and 22.2% of nurses were aware of the guidelines in China, and 19.0% of physicians and 9.5% of nurses comprehended the 9th edition of the guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP). Additionally, 37.6% of the medical staff chose a prophylaxis method based on the related guidelines, and 10.3% could demonstrate the exact indication for mechanical pattern application. Worries about skin injury, difficulty with removal and discomfort during mechanical thromboprophylaxis were cited by more than 30% of nurses, which was significantly more frequent than for physicians (graduated compression stockings: 54.3% VS 34.1%, 60.7% VS 49%, and 59.4% VS 54%, p = 0.000; intermittent pneumatic compression: 31% VS 22.2%, 19.2% VS 13.9%, and 37.8% VS 27.2%, p = 0.000). Conclusions and Relevance The knowledge of VTE prophylaxis among the medical staff of ICUs in North China remains limited, which may lead to a lack of standardization of VTE prophylaxis. Strengthened, standardized training may help medical staff to improve their comprehension of the relevant guidelines and may finally reduce the occurrence of VTE in ICUs and improve the prognosis of critically ill patients with VTE."

To evaluate the relationship of urease with dental plaque microbial profiles in children as it relates to dental caries, and to identify the main contributors to this activity. Methods 82 supragingival plaque samples were collected from 44 children at baseline and one year later, as part of a longitudinal study on urease and caries in children. DNA was extracted; the V3–V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing. Urease activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay. Data were analyzed with Qiime. Results Plaque urease activity was significantly associated with the composition of the microbial communities of the dental plaque (Baseline P = 0.027, One Year P = 0.012). The bacterial taxa whose proportion in dental plaque exhibited significant variation by plaque urease levels in both visits were the family Pasteurellaceae (Baseline P<0.001; One Year P = 0.0148), especially Haemophilus parainfluenzae. No association was observed between these bacteria and dental caries. Bacteria in the genus Leptotrichia were negatively associated with urease and positively associated with dental caries (Bonferroni P<0.001). Conclusions Alkali production by urease enzymes primarily from species in the family Pasteurellaceae can be an important ecological determinant in children’s dental plaque. Further studies are needed to establish the role of urease-associated bacteria in the acid/base homeostasis of the dental plaque, and in the development and prediction of dental caries in children."

Baseline concentrations of tOC, ucOC and %ucOC were assessed. During 10 years of follow-up, diabetes cases were self-reported and verified against information from general practitioners or pharmacists. The association between the different forms of osteocalcin and diabetes risk was assessed with logistic regression adjusted for diabetes risk factors (waist circumference, age, sex, cohort, smoking status, family history of diabetes, hypertension, alcohol intake, physical activity and education) and dietary factors (total energy intake and energy adjusted intake of fat, fiber, protein and calcium).TOC concentration was not associated with diabetes risk, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.97 (0.91-1.03) for each ng/ml increment after adjustment for diabetes risk factors and dietary factors. No association between ucOC and %ucOC and the risk of diabetes was observed either. In sex stratified analyses (P interaction = 0.07), higher %ucOC tended to be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in a multivariable model in women (OR 1.05 for each increment of 5% ucOC (1.00-1.11), Ptrend = 0.08), but not in men (OR 0.96 for each increment of 5% ucOC (0.88-1.04)). When waist circumference was replaced by body mass index, none of the osteocalcin forms were associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in the final model among both women and men.Available evidence suggests that tOC, ucOC and %ucOC are each not associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, more large-scale cohort studies are needed to clarify the presence of any association between the different forms of osteocalcin and the risk of type 2 diabetes."

We also analyzed the effect of land use (anthrome) on weekly fire cycle significance. Fire density (fire counts.km-2) observed per week day in each region was modeled using a negative binomial regression model, with fire counts as response variable, region area as offset and a structured random effect to account for spatial dependence. Anthrome (settled, cropland, natural, rangeland), religion (Christian, Muslim, mixed) week day, and their 2-way and 3-way interactions were used as independent variables. Models were also built separately for each anthrome, relating regional fire density with week day and religious affiliation. Analysis revealed a significant interaction between religion and week day, i.e. regions with different religious affiliation (Christian, Muslim) display distinct weekly cycles of burning. However, the religion vs. week day interaction only is significant for croplands, i.e. fire activity in African croplands is significantly lower on Sunday in Christian regions and on Friday in Muslim regions. Magnitude of fire activity does not differ significantly among week days in rangelands and in natural areas, where fire use is under less strict control than in croplands. These findings can contribute towards improved specification of ignition patterns in regional/global vegetation fire models, and may lead to more accurate meteorological and chemical weather forecasting."
https://openalex.org/W2191536914,"Neurotransmitter transporter ubiquitination is emerging as the main mechanism for endocytosis and sorting of cargo into lysosomes. In this study, we demonstrate PKC-dependent ubiquitination of three different isoforms of the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1). Incubation of cells expressing transporter with the PKC activator phorbol ester induced a dramatic, time-dependent increase in GlyT1 ubiquitination, followed by accumulation of GlyT1 in EEA1 positive early endosomes. This occurred via a mechanism that was abolished by inhibition of PKC. GlyT1 endocytosis was confirmed in both retinal sections and primary cultures of mouse amacrine neurons. Replacement of only all lysines in the N-and C-termini to arginines prevented ubiquitination and endocytosis, displaying redundancy in the mechanism of ubiquitination. Interestingly, a 40-50% reduction in glycine uptake was detected in phorbol-ester stimulated cells expressing the WT-GlyT1, whereas no significant change was for the mutant protein, demonstrating that endocytosis participates in the reduction of uptake. Consistent with previous findings for the dopamine transporter DAT, ubiquitination of GlyT1 tails functions as sorting signal to deliver transporter into the lysosome and removal of ubiquitination sites dramatically attenuated the rate of GlyT1 degradation. Finally, we showed for the first time that PKC-dependent GlyT1 phosphorylation was not affected by removal of ubiquitination sites, suggesting separate PKC-dependent signaling events for these posttranslational modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2185904330,"Viral respiratory infections activate the innate immune response in the airway epithelium through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and induce airway inflammation, which causes acute exacerbation of asthma. Although increases in IL-17A expression were observed in the airway of severe asthma patients, the interaction between IL-17A and TLR activation in airway epithelium remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-17A and polyI:C, the ligand of TLR3, synergistically induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (G-CSF, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL5, IL-1F9), but not type I interferon (IFN-α1, -β) in primary culture of normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Synergistic induction after co-stimulation with IL-17A and polyI:C was observed from 2 to 24 hours after stimulation. Treatment with cycloheximide or actinomycin D had no effect, suggesting that the synergistic induction occurred without de novo protein synthesis or mRNA stabilization. Inhibition of the TLR3, TLR/TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon β (TRIF), NF-κB, and IRF3 pathways decreased the polyI:C- and IL-17A/polyI:C-induced G-CSF and IL-8 mRNA expression. Comparing the levels of mRNA induction between co-treatment with IL-17A/polyI:C and treatment with polyI:C alone, blocking the of NF-κB pathway significantly attenuated the observed synergism. In western blotting analysis, activation of both NF-κB and IRF3 was observed in treatment with polyI:C and co-treatment with IL-17A/polyI:C; moreover, co-treatment with IL-17A/polyI:C augmented IκB-α phosphorylation as compared to polyI:C treatment alone. Collectively, these findings indicate that IL-17A and TLR3 activation cooperate to induce proinflammatory responses in the airway epithelium via TLR3/TRIF-mediated NF-κB/IRF3 activation, and that enhanced activation of the NF-κB pathway plays an essential role in synergistic induction after co-treatment with IL-17A and polyI:C in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2213040504,"During text reading, the parafoveal word was usually presented between 2° and 5° from the point of fixation. Whether semantic information of parafoveal words can be processed during sentence reading is a critical and long-standing issue. Recently, studies using the RSVP-flanker paradigm have shown that the incongruent parafoveal word, presented as right flanker, elicited a more negative N400 compared with the congruent parafoveal word. This suggests that the semantic information of parafoveal words can be extracted and integrated during sentence reading, because the N400 effect is a classical index of semantic integration. However, as most previous studies did not control the word-pair congruency of the parafoveal and the foveal words that were presented in the critical triad, it is still unclear whether such integration happened at the sentence level or just at the word-pair level. The present study addressed this question by manipulating verbs in Chinese sentences to yield either a semantically congruent or semantically incongruent context for the critical noun. In particular, the interval between the critical nouns and verbs was controlled to be 4 or 5 characters. Thus, to detect the incongruence of the parafoveal noun, participants had to integrate it with the global sentential context. The results revealed that the N400 time-locked to the critical triads was more negative in incongruent than in congruent sentences, suggesting that parafoveal semantic information can be integrated at the sentence level during Chinese reading."
https://openalex.org/W2241777333,"Bacterial pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are structurally diverse pathogen-secreted proteins that form cell-damaging channels in the membranes of host cells. Most PFTs are released as water-soluble monomers that first oligomerize on the membrane before inserting a transmembrane channel. To modulate specificity and increase potency, many PFTs recognize specific cell surface receptors that increase the local toxin concentration on cell membranes, thereby facilitating channel formation. Vibrio cholerae cytolysin (VCC) is a toxin secreted by the human pathogen responsible for pandemic cholera disease and acts as a defensive agent against the host immune system. Although it has been shown that VCC utilizes specific glycan receptors on the cell surface, additional direct contacts with the membrane must also play a role in toxin binding. To better understand the nature of these interactions, we conducted a systematic investigation of the membrane-binding surface of VCC to identify additional membrane interactions important in cell targeting. Through cell-based assays on several human-derived cell lines, we show that VCC is unlikely to utilize high affinity protein receptors as do structurally similar toxins from Staphylococcus aureus. Next, we identified a number of specific amino acid residues that greatly diminish the VCC potency against cells and investigated the interplay between glycan binding and these direct lipid contacts. Finally, we used model membranes to parse the importance of these key residues in lipid and cholesterol binding. Our study provides a complete functional map of the VCC membrane-binding surface and insights into the integration of sugar, lipid, and cholesterol binding interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2194528189,"Cholestatic liver diseases exhibit higher levels of serum γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and incidence of secondary osteoporosis. GGT has been identified as a novel bone-resorbing factor that stimulates osteoclast formation. The aim of this study was to elucidate the interaction of elevated GGT levels and cholestatic liver disease-induced bone loss.Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated control (SO) rats, bile duct ligation (BDL) rats, and anti-GGT antibody-treated BDL rats (AGT). Serum GGT level was measured. Bone mineral density (BMD) was analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Bone morphometric parameters and microarchitectural properties were determined by micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry of the distal metaphysis of femurs. Alterations of bone metabolism-related factors were evaluated by cytokine array. Effects of GGT on osteoblasts or stromal cells were evaluated by RT-PCR, enzyme activity, and mineralization ability.Serum levels of GGT were significantly elevated in the BDL-group. In the BDL group, BMD, bone mass percentage, and osteoblast number were significantly decreased, whereas osteoclast number was significantly increased. These alterations were markedly attenuated in the AGT group. The mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, LPS-induced CXC chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-1β and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand were upregulated, and those of interferon-γ and osteoprotegerin were downregulated in the GGT-treated stromal cells. Furthermore, GGT inhibited mineral nodule formation and expression of alkaline phosphatase and bone sialo-protein in osteoblastic cells.Our results indicate that elevated GGT level is involved in hepatic osteodystrophy through secretion of bone resorbing factor from GGT-stimulated osteoblasts/bone marrow stromal cells. In addition, GGT also possesses suppressive effects on bone formation. Managing elevated GGT levels by anti-GGT antibody may become a novel therapeutic agent for hepatic osteodystrophy in chronic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2178104524,"Micro-blogging services, such as Twitter, offer opportunities to analyse user behaviour. Discovering and distinguishing behavioural patterns in micro-blogging services is valuable. However, it is difficult and challenging to distinguish users, and to track the temporal development of collective attention within distinct user groups in Twitter. In this paper, we formulate this problem as tracking matrices decomposed by Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation for time-sequential matrix data, and propose a novel extension of Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation, which we refer to as Time Evolving Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation (TENMF). In our method, we describe users and words posted in some time interval by a matrix, and use several matrices as time-sequential data. Subsequently, we apply Time Evolving Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation to these time-sequential matrices. TENMF can decompose time-sequential matrices, and can track the connection among decomposed matrices, whereas previous NMF decomposes a matrix into two lower dimension matrices arbitrarily, which might lose the time-sequential connection. Our proposed method has an adequately good performance on artificial data. Moreover, we present several results and insights from experiments using real data from Twitter."
https://openalex.org/W2175928681,"Zinc finger protein 809 (ZFP809) is a member of the Kruppel-associated box-containing zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) family, and is highly expressed in mouse immature cells. ZFP809 is known to inhibit the expression of transduced genes driven by Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV)-typed retroviral vectors by binding to the primer binding site (PBS) located downstream of the MLV-long terminal repeat (LTR) of the vectors and recruiting protein complexes that introduce epigenetic silencing marks such as histone modifications and DNA methylation at the MLV-LTR. However, it remains undetermined what domains of ZFP809 among the KRAB domain at N-terminus and the seven zinc fingers are critical for gene silencing. In this study, we assessed subcellular localization, gene silencing ability, and binding ability to the PBS of a series of truncated and mutated ZFP809 proteins. We revealed the essential role of the KRAB A box for all functions assessed, together with the accessory roles of a subset of zinc fingers. Our data also suggest that interaction between KAP1 and the KRAB A box of ZFP809 is critical in KAP1-dependent control of gene silencing for ZFP809 targets."
https://openalex.org/W2195653461,"Tree invasions have substantial impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and trees that are dispersed by animals are more likely to become invasive. In addition, hybridisation between plants is well documented as a source of new weeds, as hybrids gain new characteristics that allow them to become invasive. Corymbia torelliana is an invasive tree with an unusual animal dispersal mechanism: seed dispersal by stingless bees, that hybridizes readily with other species. We examined hybrids between C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora to determine whether hybrids have inherited the seed dispersal characteristics of C. torelliana that allow bee dispersal. Some hybrid fruits displayed the characteristic hollowness, resin production and resin chemistry associated with seed dispersal by bees. However, we did not observe bees foraging on any hybrid fruits until they had been damaged. We conclude that C. torelliana and C. citriodora subsp. citriodora hybrids can inherit some fruit characters that are associated with dispersal by bees, but we did not find a hybrid with the complete set of characters that would enable bee dispersal. However, around 20,000 hybrids have been planted in Australia, and ongoing monitoring is necessary to identify any hybrids that may become invasive."

Aim of this study was to assess the effects of social and geographical determinants on the risk of bacteraemia in a rural-urban transition zone in Ghana.Children below 15 years of age with fever were recruited at an outpatient department in the suburban belt of Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. Blood was taken for bacterial culture and malaria diagnostics. The socio-economic status of participants was calculated using Principle Component Analysis. A scale, based on key urban characteristics, was established to quantify urbanicity for all communities in the hospital catchment area. A case-control analysis was conducted, where children with and without bacteraemia were cases and controls, respectively.Bacteraemia was detected in 72 (3.1%) of 2,306 hospital visits. Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS; n = 24; 33.3%) and Salmonella typhi (n = 18; 25.0%) were the most common isolates. Logistic regression analysis showed that bacteraemia was negatively associated with urbanicity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.7-1.0) and socio-economic status (OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6-0.9). Both associations were stronger if only NTS infections were used as cases (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.3-0.8 and OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-1.0, respectively).The results of this study highlight the importance of individual as well as community factors as independent risk factors for invasive bacterial infection (IBI) and especially NTS. Epidemiological data support physicians, public health experts and policy makers to identify disease prevention and treatment needs in order to secure public health in the transitional societies of developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2278841256,"Aim The aim of this study is to determine if the fatigue of cervical muscles has a significant influence on the head-neck segment musculo-tendinous stiffness. Methods Ten men (aged 21.2 ± 1.9 years) performed four quick-release trials of flexion at 30 and 50% MVC before and after the induction of muscular fatigue on cervical flexors. Electromyographic activity was recorded on the sternocleidomastoids (SCM) and spinal erectors (SE), bilaterally. Musculo-tendinous stiffness was calculated through the quick-release method adapted to the head-neck segment. Results We noticed a significant linear increase of the head-neck segment musculo-tendinous stiffness with the increase of exertion level both before (P < 0.0001) and after the fatigue procedure (P < 0.0001). However, this linear relationship was not different before and after the fatigue procedure. EMG analysis revealed a significant increase of the root mean square for the right SCM (P = 0.0002), the left SCM (P < 0.0001), the right SE (P < 0.0001), and the left SE (P < 0.0001) and a significant decrease of the median power frequency only for the right (P = 0.0006) and the left (P = 0.0003) SCM with muscular fatigue. Discussion We did not find significant changes in the head-neck segment musculo-tendinous stiffness with fatigue of cervical muscles. We found a significant increase in EMG activity in the SCM and the SE after the induction of fatigue of the SCM. Our findings suggest that with fatigue of cervical flexors, neck muscle activity is modulated in order to maintain the musculo-tendinous stiffness at a steady state."
https://openalex.org/W2183676172,"Although microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-protein-coding entities, they have important roles in post-transcriptional regulation of most of the human genome. These small entities generate fine-tuning adjustments in the expression of mRNA, which can mildly or massively affect the abundance of proteins. Previously, we found that the expression of miR-30c-2-3p is induced by lysophosphatidic acid and has an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. The goal here is to confirm that ATF3 mRNA is a target of miR-30c-2-3p silencing, thereby further establishing the functional role of miR-30c-2-3p. Using a combination of bioinformatics, qRT-PCR, immunoblotting and luciferase assays, we uncovered a regulatory pathway between miR-30c-2-3p and the expression of the transcription factor, ATF3. Lysophosphatidic acids triggers the expression of both miR-30c-2-3p and ATF3, which peak at 1 h and are absent 8 h post stimulation in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 serous ovarian cancer cells. The 3´-untranslated region (3´-UTR) of ATF3 was a predicted, putative target for miR-30c-2-3p, which we confirmed as a bona-fide interaction using a luciferase reporter assay. Specific mutations introduced into the predicted site of interaction between miR-30c-2-3p and the 3´-UTR of ATF3 alleviated the suppression of the luciferase signal. Furthermore, the presence of anti-miR-30c-2-3p enhanced ATF3 mRNA and protein after lysophosphatidic acid stimulation. Thus, the data suggest that after the expression of ATF3 and miR-30c-2-3p are elicited by lysophosphatidic acid, subsequently miR-30c-2-3p negatively regulates the expression of ATF3 through post-transcriptional silencing, which prevents further ATF3-related outcomes as a consequence of lysophosphatidic acid signaling."

Wound depth and patient characteristics influence scar pigmentation. However, we know little about the pathophysiology leading to hyperpigmentation in healed shallow wounds and hypopigmentation in deep dermal wound scars. We sought to determine whether dermal fibroblast signaling influences melanocyte responses.Epidermal melanocytes from three Caucasians and three African-Americans were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the entire genome. Melanocyte genetic profiles were determined using principal component analysis. We assessed melanocyte phenotype and gene expression in response to dermal fibroblast-conditioned medium and determined potential mesenchymal mediators by proteome profiling the fibroblast-conditioned medium.Six melanocyte samples demonstrated significant variability in phenotype and gene expression at baseline and in response to fibroblast-conditioned medium. Genetic profiling for SNPs in receptors for 13 identified soluble fibroblast-secreted mediators demonstrated considerable heterogeneity, potentially explaining the variable melanocyte responses to fibroblast-conditioned medium.Our data suggest that melanocytes respond to dermal fibroblast-derived mediators independent of keratinocytes and raise the possibility that mesenchymal-epidermal interactions influence skin pigmentation during cutaneous scarring."
https://openalex.org/W2195148376,"This article introduces the neuroimaging community to the dynamic visualization workbench, Weave (https://www.oicweave.org/), and a set of enhancements to allow the visualization of brain maps. The enhancements comprise a set of brain choropleths and the ability to display these as stacked slices, accessible with a slider. For the first time, this allows the neuroimaging community to take advantage of the advanced tools already available for exploring geographic data. Our brain choropleths are modeled after widely used geographic maps but this mashup of brain choropleths with extant visualization software fills an important neuroinformatic niche. To date, most neuroinformatic tools have provided online databases and atlases of the brain, but not good ways to display the related data (e.g., behavioral, genetic, medical, etc). The extension of the choropleth to brain maps allows us to leverage general-purpose visualization tools for concurrent exploration of brain images and related data. Related data can be represented as a variety of tables, charts and graphs that are dynamically linked to each other and to the brain choropleths. We demonstrate that the simplified region-based analyses that underlay choropleths can provide insights into neuroimaging data comparable to those achieved by using more conventional methods. In addition, the interactive interface facilitates additional insights by allowing the user to filter, compare, and drill down into the visual representations of the data. This enhanced data visualization capability is useful during the initial phases of data analysis and the resulting visualizations provide a compelling way to publish data as an online supplement to journal articles."
https://openalex.org/W2308201980,"Rosiglitazone is a well-known anti-diabetic drug that increases insulin sensitivity via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) activation, but unfortunately it causes bone loss in animals and humans. A previous study showed that prolyl hydroxylase domain protein (PHD) plays a role in rosiglitazone-induced adipocyte differentiation. Based on the inverse relationship between adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation, we investigated whether PHD is involved in the effects of rosiglitazone on osteoblast differentiation. Rosiglitazone inhibited osteoblast differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner, and in parallel induced three PHD isoforms (PHD1, 2, and 3). PHD inhibitors and knockdown of each isoform prevented the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone on osteoblast differentiation and increased the expression of Runx2, a transcription factor essential for osteoblastogenesis. MG-132, a proteasomal inhibitor also prevented the rosiglitazone-induced degradation of Runx2. Furthermore, both increased PHD isoform expressions and reduced osteoblast differentiation by rosiglitazone were prevented by PPARγ antagonists, indicating these effects were mediated via PPARγ activation. In vivo oral administration of rosiglitazone to female ICR mice for 8 weeks reduced bone mineral densities and plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and increased PHD expression in femoral primary bone marrow cells and the ubiquitination of Runx2. Together, this suggests that the rosiglitazone-induced suppression of osteoblast differentiation is at least partly induced via PPARγ-mediated PHD induction and subsequent promotion of the ubiquitination and degradation of Runx2."
