https://openalex.org/W2097417202,"Progressive oxygenation of the Earth's early biosphere is thought to have resulted in increased sulphide oxidation during continental weathering, leading to a corresponding increase in marine sulphate concentration. Accurate reconstruction of marine sulphate reservoir size is therefore important for interpreting the oxygenation history of early Earth environments. Few data, however, specifically constrain how sulphate concentrations may have changed during the Proterozoic era (2.5-0.54 Gyr ago). Prior to 2.2 Gyr ago, when oxygen began to accumulate in the Earth's atmosphere, sulphate concentrations are inferred to have been <1 mM and possibly <200 microM, on the basis of limited isotopic variability preserved in sedimentary sulphides and experimental data showing suppressed isotopic fractionation at extremely low sulphate concentrations. By 0.8 Gyr ago, oxygen and thus sulphate levels may have risen significantly. Here we report large stratigraphic variations in the sulphur isotope composition of marine carbonate-associated sulphate, and use a rate-dependent model for sulphur isotope change that allows us to track changes in marine sulphate concentrations throughout the Proterozoic. Our calculations indicate sulphate levels between 1.5 and 4.5 mM, or 5-15 per cent of modern values, for more than 1 Gyr after initial oxygenation of the Earth's biosphere. Persistence of low oceanic sulphate demonstrates the protracted nature of Earth's oxygenation. It links biospheric evolution to temporal patterns in the depositional behaviour of marine iron- and sulphur-bearing minerals, biological cycling of redox-sensitive elements and availability of trace metals essential to eukaryotic development."

Using HEK293 cells expressing αMβ2 or the individual constituent chains on their surface, we analyzed the contributions of the αM or β2 subunits to functional responses mediated by the integrin. In cells expressing only αM or β2, the individual subunits were not associated with the endogenous integrins of the cells, and other partners for the subunits were not detected by surface labeling and immunoprecipitation under a variety of conditions. The αM cells mediated adhesion and spreading on a series of αMβ2 ligands (fibrinogen, Factor X, iC3b, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and denatured ovalbumin) but could not support cell migration to any of these. The spreading of the αM cells suggested an unanticipated linkage of this subunit to the cytoskeleton. The β2 cells supported migration and attachment but not spreading on a subset of the αMβ2 ligands. The heterodimeric receptor and its individual subunits were purified from the cells by affinity chromatography and recapitulated the ligand binding properties of the corresponding cell lines. These data indicate that each subunit of αMβ2 contributes distinct properties to αMβ2 and that, in most but not all cases, the response of the integrin is a composite of the functions of its individual subunits.

Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors that mediate a wide spectrum of biological functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6892) Google Scholar). The β2 subfamily, often referred to as the leukocyte integrins, is composed of four members that share a common β2 subunit that associates noncovalently with one of four distinct but structurally homologous α subunits to form integrins αMβ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18, CR3), αLβ2 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, CD11a/CD18), p150/95 (αXβ2, CD11c/CD18), and αDβ2 (CD11d/CD18) (reviewed in Refs. 2Larson R.S.

These complex responses depend upon the capacity of αMβ2 to mediate leukocyte adhesion and migration; and consequently, αMβ2 plays a central role in inflammation. The characterization of αMβ2-deficient mice has confirmed these findings by showing that a variety of leukocyte-dependent responses are compromised in these animals (e.g. Refs. 4Ding Z.M.

The capacity of αMβ2 to support adhesion and migration depends upon its ability to recognize and mediate responses to a diverse set of structurally unrelated ligands, including human fibrinogen (Fg) 1The abbreviations used are: Fg, fibrinogen; FX, Factor X; MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HEK293, human epithelial kidney 293; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; dOva, denatured ovalbumin; PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone; SDL, specificity-determining loop.

In recognizing Fg, two peptide sequences within its γ chain that interact with αMβ2 have been identified: P1 (γ chain amino acids 190–202) (21Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and P2 (γ chain amino acids 377–395) (22Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two segments, one within each of its constituent chains, have been implicated in the binding of protein ligands to αMβ2: 1) the αMI (or A) domain, an ∼200-amino acid segment in the N-terminal third of the αM subunit that is structurally very similar to the I domains within the α subunits of the other leukocyte integrins (23Lee J-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 24Leitinger B. Hogg N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and 2Larson R.S. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1990; 114: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) the β2I-like domain, which is structurally similar to the α subunit I domains as well as the I-like domains found in all β subunits of the integrins (25Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B.

Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Each of these segments contains a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), which is critical to the ligand binding functions of αMβ2 and other integrins (23Lee J-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 28Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12311-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One manifestation of the contribution of the MIDAS to ligand binding is that mutagenesis of the predicted cation coordination residues of the β2 or αM MIDAS destroys the capacity of αMβ2 to bind multiple ligands (e.g. Refs. 31Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Goodman T.G. Bajt M.L. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A second manifestation of the MIDAS contribution is that different divalent cations exert differential effects on ligand binding. Mn2+ enhances ligand binding function, Mg2+ supports it, and Ca2+ can be suppressive (35Dransfield I. Cabanas C. Craig A. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 36Leitinger B. McDowall A. Stanley P. Hogg N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 37Li R. Rieu P. Griffith D.L. Scott D. Arnaout M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the αMI domain or other I domains show that different cations differentially influence structure (29Lee J-O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for the involvement of the αM subunit in ligand binding has derived from multiple studies in which its I domain has been expressed and shown to engage ligand (11Muchowski P.J. Zhang L. Chang E.R. Soule H.R. Plow E.F. Moyle M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26419-26423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Michishita M. Videm V.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18769-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Evidence for the involvement of the β subunit is less direct. Certain mutations in the β2 subunit abolish the binding of multiple ligands (31Bajt M.L. Goodman T. McGuire S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 33Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and certain ligands (iC3b and FX) are still capable of binding to recombinant αMβ2 lacking an αMI domain (40Yalamanchili P. Lu C.F. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21877-21882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rather than a direct involvement of the β subunit, the β2I domain may regulate the function of the αM subunit. Consistent with such a regulatory role, epitopes of several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that activate the β2 integrins, KIM185, KIM127, MEM48, and CBR lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/2, reside in or close to the β2I domain (41Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Robinson M.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42Bazil V. Strominger J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3792-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43Yan S.R. Huang M. Berton G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1902-1910PubMed Google Scholar), and cells expressing only the αM subunit in the absence of β2 appear to bind ligands (such as Fg) that do not bind to αMβ2 in which residues in the β2 MIDAS motif have been mutated (22Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of the β2 subunit to ligand recognition by αMβ2 remains uncertain. In this study, we took advantage of the capacity of human epithelial kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to express the individual αM or β2 subunits or heterodimeric αMβ2 on their surface (22Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 44Xiong Y-M. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19340-19349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The adhesive and migratory properties of the cells were analyzed, and the cells also were used as a source to purify and characterize the individual subunits. These comparisons allowed us demonstrate that both subunits can contribute directly to ligand binding and to assign specific functions to each subunit of the receptor. Monoclonal Antibodies, Proteins, and Synthetic Peptides—The mAbs used in this study were 44a (anti-CD11b), OKM1 (anti-CD11b), LM2/1 (anti-CD11b), 904 (anti-CD11b), IB4 (anti-CD18), TS1/18 (anti-CD18), and W6/32 (anti-major histocompatibility complex class I). The hybridoma cell lines producing these mAbs were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and the mAbs were purified from mouse ascites using recombinant protein G columns (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). mAb 68-5A5 (anti-CD18) was from Neo Markers (Fremont, CA), and MEM148 was purchased from Serotec (Palo Alto, CA). mAbs to integrins α4 (clone P1H4), αV (P3G8), β1 (12G10), and β3 (25E11) were obtained from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Recombinant human ICAM-1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and human iC3b were obtained from Calbiochem. Human Fg and FX were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (Bethesda, MD). Hookworm neutrophil inhibitory factor was a gift from Corvas International (San Diego, CA). Peptides P1 (GWTVFQKRLDGSV) and P2-C (KIIPFNRLTIG) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Model 430A peptide synthesizer and purified by HPLC as described (22Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L.

Development of αMβ2, αLβ2, αM, and β2 Cell Lines—HEK293 cells were stably transfected using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) with 0.5–5 μg of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) containing the full-length cDNAs for αM and/or β2 or vector alone (mock-transfected) as a control as described previously (33Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 45Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29953-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected using neomycin sulfate (Invitrogen), and cells expressing the receptors were detected and sorted by flow cytometry (FACS) using a FACStar instrument (BD Biosciences) and mAb 904, IB4 or TS1/18. The cell lines obtained were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 μm l-glutamine, and 2 mg/ml neomycin (all from Invitrogen) (33Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For selected experiments, a HEK cell line expressing both αMβ2 and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor was used; these cells have been described previously (46Pluskota E. Solovjov D.A. Plow E.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1582-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To verify that the specificity-determining loop was present and that β2I domain was not mutated in the β2 cells, total RNA was isolated from 1.5 × 105 β2 cells, and cDNA was prepared using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA obtained was used as template for PCR performed with 5′-GATCCTGACTCCATTCGCTGCGACACCCGGCC-3′ (β2238) as the 5′-primer and 5′-TCCATTGCTGCAGAAGGAGTCGTAGG-3′ (β21239) as the 3′-primer. After amplification, the PCR product was isolated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and only a band of ∼1 kb was detected. This band was extracted from the gels using the QIAquick gel extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc.) according the manufacturer's protocol, and the sample was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and sequenced using β2238 or 5′-GACCAGGCCAGGCAGCAGCGTTCAACGTGACC-3′ (β2395) as the sequencing primer. FACS—Transfected HEK293 cells were harvested with cell dissociation buffer (Invitrogen); washed twice; suspended in staining medium consisting of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.1% goat normal serum; and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with the selected primary mAb at 10 μg/ml. In some experiments, the divalent cations were replaced with 1 mm EDTA. After incubation, the cells were washed twice by centrifugation and resuspended in 30 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. The cells were washed three times with HBSS/HEPES, and cell-bound antibodies were detected using a FACScan. Data were analyzed using the LYSIS program (BD Biosciences). The mean fluorescence intensity of the αMβ2, αLβ2, αM, and β2 cells used was 150–400 units when staining with an appropriate mAb (see “Results”) compared with ∼5 units for mock-transfected cells and <10 units for a non-reactive mAb. Immunoprecipitation of Surface-expressed Proteins—Transfected HEK293 cells were harvested with cell dissociation buffer as described above, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended to 108 cells/ml in Dulbecco's PBS. Surface-expressed proteins were labeled with EZ-Link™ sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 30 min, non-reacted sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was removed by washing three times with HBSS/HEPES; the cells were resuspended in HBSS/HEPES to 108 cells/ml; and mAb 44a (for the αM cells) or IB4 (for all other cells) was added. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, non-bound antibody was removed by washing three times with HBSS/HEPES, and 109 cells were pelleted by centrifugation and solubilized at 4 °C with lysis buffer composed of Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells (Sigma) and one of the following detergents: 5% Triton X-100 (Fisher), 5% Tween 20 (Fisher), 1% CHAPS (Sigma), or 20 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem). After mixing at 4 °C for 20 min, the samples were clarified by centrifugation, and 15 μl of protein G-agarose (Pierce) pretreated with non-transfected HEK293 cell lysate were added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with cold cell lysis buffer. After the last wash, 60 μl of SDS electrophoresis endurance loading buffer (ICS BioExpress, Kaysville, UT) were added; samples were boiled for 2 min; and bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis in 4–20% polyacrylamide gel plates (ISC BioExpress) using a Tris/SDS/HEPES buffer system. Separated proteins were transferred from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and protein bands were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) and Opti-4CN-amplified substrate for horse-radish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). Receptor and Subunit Purification—αMβ2, αM, and β2 were purified from transfected HEK293 cells using a modification of the method of Miller et al. (47Miller L.J. Wiebe J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 2381-2383PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 g of each cell line were harvested, washed, and lysed with 20 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in TBS containing 0.5 ml of protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells and 5 mm EDTA for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation, diluted 4-fold with TBS, and loaded onto a mAb column (1 × 4 cm) at 4 °C. For αM purification, immobilized mAb LM2/1 (anti-αM) was used; and for αMβ2 and β2 purification, immobilized mAb IB4 (anti-β2) was employed. To prepare the immunoaffinity columns, purified mAbs were coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol to final concentrations of 1.8–2.2 mg of immobilized protein/1 ml of swollen gel. After washing with 100 ml of TBS containing 10 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside and 1 mm CaCl2, bound protein was eluted with 2 column volumes of 20 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.2) containing 10 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. Immediately after elution, the pH of the eluates was adjusted to pH 7.2 with 1 m Tris. In addition to SDS-PAGE (see “Results”), the purified β2 subunit from these cells was characterized by HPLC gel filtration chromatography on a 7.5 mm × 60 cm UltroPac TSK G4000SW column (LKB Bromma, Uppsala, Sweden) in 0.15 m NaCl and 0.05 m Tris (pH 7.4). Ligand Binding Assays—Na125I (specific activity of 15 mCi of 125I/mg of iodine; Amersham Biosciences) was used to radioiodinate purified αMβ2, αM, and β2 by a modified chloramine-T procedure (48Miles L.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4303-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography, radiolabeled αMβ2 showed only two bands with estimated molecular masses of ∼150 and 90 kDa, and radiolabeled αM and β2 showed only one band each with molecular masses of 150 and 90 kDa, respectively. The patterns and mobilities were indistinguishable from those of the unlabeled forms of the receptor and its subunits. The radiolabeled proteins were stored at -20 °C and used within 1 month. Fg, FX, iC3b, ICAM-1, and denatured ovalbumin (dOva) were biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each biotinylated protein (2 nm) was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ultra-Link immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The non-reacted streptavidin was blocked with 1% biotin; and the beads were washed three times with 20 ml of TBS, stored at 4 °C, and used within 1 week. To determine binding of the ligands to the radiolabeled receptor or its subunits, 20 μl of the ligand beads were incubated with 10 μg of radioiodinated αMβ2, αM, or β2 for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2 and then washed five times with TBS containing 2 mm MnCl2 and 10 mmn-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside. The amount of radioactivity retained by the beads was measured using an Isotec γ counter (ICN Flow Titertec, ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Each point is the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Cell Attachment/Adhesion Assays—48-Well Costar tissue culture plates were coated with 200 μl of different concentrations (0–100 nm) of iC3b, Fg, FX, ICAM-1, or dOva overnight at 4 °C and then post-coated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for 1 h at room temperature (33Zhang L. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18211-18216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Control wells were coated with PVP only. Prior to use, the plates were rinsed three times with PBS. Transfected HEK293 cells were harvested as described above, washed three times with 50 ml of divalent ion-free HBSS/HEPES (pH 7.4), and resuspended in divalent ion-free HBSS/HEPES, and then the selected divalent cations were added. The cells were seeded at 1.5–2 × 105 cells/well onto the assay plates and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For inhibition experiments, the cells were pretreated with the selected mAbs or other reagents for 15 min at 37 °C prior to addition to the coated wells. To determine the extent of attachment/adhesion, the plates were washed three times with PBS, and the number of adherent cells in each well was quantified using the Cyquant cell proliferation assay kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after washing, the plates were frozen at -70 °C for 4 h and thawed in the presence of cell lysis buffer containing green fluorescent dye, which can be incorporated into DNA. After 30 min at room temperature in the dark, the fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor II fluorescence multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The data from cell adhesion and migration assays (see below) are presented as mean fluorescence intensity ± S.D. of three independent experiments. To distinguish attached and spread cells from those attached but not spread, after adhesion, the plates were rinsed three times with PBS, and the adherent cells were immediately photographed (magnification ×200). The spread cells were quantified as a percent of the attached cells, counting a total of 1000 cells. Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays were performed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 using Costar 24-transwell plates with tissue culture-treated 8-μm pore polycarbonate filters (Corning Inc.) as described previously (20Forsyth C.B. Solovjov D.A. Ugarova T.P. Plow E.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The lower chambers contained 600 μl of medium with the selected ligands, and the upper chambers contained final volumes of 200 μl after addition of the cells. To begin the assay, 50 μl of cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/well) in medium were added to the upper chambers, and the plates were placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Assays were stopped after 16 h by removing the upper wells and wiping the inside of the upper wells three times with a cotton swab to remove non-migrated cells. The migrated cells, present on the undersurface of the membrane as well as in the lower chambers, were quantitated using the Cyquant cell proliferation assay kit as described above. Integrin Clustering and Immunofluorescence—Transfected cell lines were seeded onto CC2™-treated Lab-Tek® Chamber Slides™ (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at 5 × 104 cells/well in culture medium and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed, and antibody against the integrin α4 or β1 subunit was added at 10 μg/ml in HBSS (pH 7.3) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, integrin cluster formation was allowed to occur at 37 °C for 30–45 min. Next, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 22 °C and stained with biotinylated mAb to the αM subunit (44a) or the β2 subunit (IB4) for 30 min at 22 °C, followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated avidin (1:500 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 30 min at 22 °C. To analyze integrin localization and clustering on resting cells, the cells were first fixed and then stained to visualize the specific subunits as described above. The slides were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Inc., Bannockburn, IL"

https://openalex.org/W2007869884,"Discovering evidence of behaviour in fossilized vertebrates is rare. Even rarer is evidence of behaviour in non-avialan dinosaurs that directly relates to stereotypical behaviour seen in extant birds (avians) and not previously predicted in non-avialan dinosaurs1,2. Here we report the discovery of a new troodontid taxon from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of western Liaoning, China. Numerous other three-dimensionally preserved vertebrate fossils have been recovered recently at this locality, including some specimens preserving behavioural information3. The new troodontid preserves several features that have been implicated in avialan origins. Notably, the specimen is preserved in the stereotypical sleeping or resting posture found in extant Aves4. Evidence of this behaviour outside of the crown group Aves further demonstrates that many bird features occurred early in dinosaurian evolution5,6."

https://openalex.org/W1973254683,"The third member of the family of junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), JAM-3, also called JAM-C, was recently shown to be a novel counter-receptor on platelets for the leukocyte β2-integrin Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18). Here, new functional aspects of the role of endothelial cell JAM-C were investigated. Endothelial cells express JAM-C, which is predominantly localized within junctions at interendothelial contacts, since it codistributes with a tight junction component, zonula occludens-1. Whereas JAM-C does not participate in neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells, it mediates neutrophil transmigration in a Mac-1-dependent manner. In particular, inhibition of JAM-C significantly reduced neutrophil transendothelial migration, and the combination of JAM-C and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 blockade almost completely abolished neutrophil transendothelial migration in vitro. In vivo, inhibition of JAM-C with soluble mouse JAM-C resulted in a 50% reduction of neutrophil emigration in the mouse model of acute thioglycollate-induced peritonitis. Thus, JAM-C participates in neutrophil transmigration and thereby provides a novel molecular target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells that promote inflammatory vascular pathologies.

Thus, JAM-C participates in neutrophil transmigration and thereby provides a novel molecular target for antagonizing interactions between vascular cells that promote inflammatory vascular pathologies. The recruitment of leukocytes is an integral part of inflammatory processes or vascular remodeling as well as during the immediate response toward bacterial infection or injury. Leukocyte recruitment requires multistep adhesive and signaling events including selectin-mediated rolling, leukocyte activation, and integrin-mediated firm adhesion and diapedesis (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1995; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (6414) Google Scholar). During firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium, members of the β2-integrin family, LFA-1 (αLβ2, CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (αMβ2, CD11b/CD18), and p150,95 (αXβ2, CD11c/CD18), as well as β1-integrins on the leukocyte surface interact with endothelial counterligands such as ICAM-1, 1The abbreviations used are: ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; PECAM-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molcule-1; JAM, junctional adhesion molecule; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. surface-associated fibrinogen, or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (2Carlos T.M.

In contrast to the first three steps (i.e. rolling, activation, and adhesion of leukocytes), the molecular mechanisms of leukocyte trans-endothelial migration are far from being understood. Although leukocytes can traverse the endothelial cell layer by transcytosis (5Feng D. Nagy J.A. Pyne K. Dvorak H.F. Dvorak A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the major route for a leukocyte to traverse the endothelial barrier is through the cleft between two or three adjacent cells. Several molecular interactions involved in diapedesis have been described. (i) Platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) (CD31), which is expressed diffusely on the surfaces of most leukocytes and at the borders of endothelial cells contacts (6Muller W.A. Ratti C.M. McDonnell S.L. Cohn Z.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Newman P.J. Berndt M.C. Gorski J. White II, G.C. Lyman S. Paddock C. Muller W.A. Science. 1990; 247: 1219-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), can undergo homophilic interactions that are important in leukocyte diapedesis (8Liao F. Ali J. Greene T. Muller W.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1349-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Bogen S. Pak J. Garifallou M. Deng X. Muller W.A. J. Exp.

Nature. 2003; 421: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). (ii) CD99, which is expressed on all leukocytes as well as on the lateral interendothelial contacts (11Muller W.A. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), controls the final step in leukocyte transmigration, which is distal to the one controlled by PECAM-1 (12Schenkel A.R. Mamdouh Z. Chen X. Liebman R.M. Muller W.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been attributed to the role of junctional adhesion molecules (JAM) in leukocyte transmigration (13Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. Santoso S. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 89: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). JAMs belong to the Ig superfamily and have two extracellular Ig domains followed by a transmembrane and a cytoplasmic region, the latter involved in cytoskeletal or signal transduction interactions (14Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The first member of this family, JAM-1 or JAM-A, was shown to participate in monocyte transmigration across endothelial cells, both by undergoing homophilic binding interactions (15Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) and with a heterophilic interaction with the β2-integrin LFA-1 (16Ostermann G. Weber K.S. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Weber C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). JAM-A is also proposed to modulate paracellular permeability (17Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), since it associates with the tight junction components cingulin, occludin, ZO-1, and AF-6 via their PDZ domains (14Ebnet K. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Vestweber D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 18Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S. Dejana E. J. Biol.

Arrate M.P. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27589-27592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and probably participates in lymphocyte homing (21Palmeri D. van Zante A. Huang C.C. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19139-19145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We and others have recently identified JAM-3 or JAM-C, expressed in endothelial cells, platelets, T cells, and natural killer cells (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Platelet JAM-C was shown to be a counter-receptor for neutrophil Mac-1, mediating neutrophil-platelet interaction under low shear (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). JAM-C was recently shown to participate in transendothial migration of lymphocytes; however, this phenomenon could be ascribed to a homophilic interaction of JAM-C, because lymphocytes do not usually engage Mac-1 binding (25Johnson-Leger C.A. Aurrand-Lions M. Beltraminelli N. Fasel N. Imhof B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Thus, it is yet unclear whether JAM-C mediates Mac-1-dependent transmigration of neutrophils. These diverse observations have prompted us to investigate the exact role of JAM-C in neutrophil transendothelial migration. Materials—The following reagents were provided from these sources: blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) against human CD18, IB4 (Alexis, Grünberg, Germany); mAb L15 against LFA-1 (Dr. Y. van Kooyk, Amsterdam, The Netherlands); mAb LPM19c against Mac-1 and mAb against ICAM-1 (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany); mAb 6S6 against β1-chain (CD29) (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany); and rabbit anti-ZO-1 from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany). mAb Gi18 specific for PECAM-1 IgG domains 1 and 2 was characterized previously and inhibited homophilic interactions of PECAM-1 (26Kroll H. Sun Q.H. Santoso S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); mAb Gi11 against human JAM-C was described previously (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar); respective isotype-matched control antibodies as well as secondary antibodies were from DAKO (Hamburg, Germany); mAb against αvβ3-integrin as well as mouse fibronectin were from Chemicon. The blocking mAb against mouse Mac-1 (M1/70), mouse LFA-1 (M17/4), and mouse ICAM-1 (3E2), as well as respective isotype-matched control antibodies, which were used for in vivo inhibition studies, were from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). MnCl2, human fibronectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were cultured as previously described (27Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood as previously described (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analysis—HUVEC were analyzed with mAb Gi11 by flow cytometry on FACSCalibur™ (Becton Dickinson) as previously described (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis for the detection of JAM-C was performed as previously described (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). HUVEC were lysed by adding sample buffer. After a 5-min incubation at 95 °C, 20 μlofthe lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, and subsequently proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with mAb Gi11 (2.5 μg/ml). Bound IgG was detected using peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti mouse IgG (dilution 1:10,000; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Nondenaturing Gel Electrophoresis—For the analysis of JAM-C under nondenaturing conditions, JAM-C was loaded onto 10% gels, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in the absence of SDS and mercaptoethanol in all reagents. Proteins were identified by silver staining or by Western blot analysis as described above. Immunofluorescence—HUVEC (20,000 cells/well) were plated onto 8-well chamber slides (Permanox; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) that were precoated with 0.2% gelatin and were allowed to adhere for 16 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, the slides were fixed with ice-cold methanol acetone (1:1, v/v), blocked with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and incubated with mAb Gi11 (10 μg/ml) and rabbit polyclonal antibody against ZO-1 (5 μg/ml) for2hat22 °C. Cells were washed, and then fluorescein-coupled anti-mouse IgG (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) or rhodamine-coupled anti-rabbit IgG was added (1:100) for 1 h at 22 °C. After extensive washing, the cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Double-stained images were merged to analyze colocalization. Production of Recombinant Soluble Human JAM-C—A specific mutation G → T at position 764 was introduced into the full-length human JAM-C cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pCDNA 4 (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) to generate a stop codon encoding for the extracellular region of JAM-C protein. For PCR amplification, mismatched (underlined) forward primer 5′-GAC CTG AAC ATT GGC TGA ATT ATT GGG GGG GTT C-3′ and 5′-GAA CCC CCC CAA TAA TTC AGC CAA TGT TCA GGT C-3′ of JAM-C cDNA were constructed. After denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, an aliquot of 20 ng of plasmid was amplified for 12 cycles (denaturation for 30 s at 95 °C, annealing for 60 s at 55 °C, and extension for 6 min at 68 °C). Plasmid DNA was then digested with DpnI endonuclease for 1 h at 37 °C and transformed into DH5α high efficiency competent Escherichia coli. For subsequent transfection, the JAM-C construct was validated by nucleotide sequence analysis. CHO cells were transfected with 6 μg of JAM-C construct using Lipofectamine in Opti-MEM Medium (Invitrogen) as previously described (28Santoso S. Amrhein J. Hofmann H. Sachs U.J.H. Walka M. Kroll H. Kiefel V. Blood. 1999; 94: 4103-4111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectant producing soluble JAM-C was selected with Geneticin (G418; final concentration, 800 μg/ml; Invitrogen) and was enriched by subcloning. An aliquot of 50 ml of cell supernatant was collected, and soluble recombinant JAM-C was purified by affinity chromatography using a 3-ml affinity column coupled with mAb Gi11 (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Purified JAM-C was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon membrane (Millipore), and stored at –20 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the use of a BCA kit (Perbio, Bonn, Germany). Production of Recombinant Soluble Mouse JAM-C—cDNA of murine soluble JAM-C (extracellular part of the molecule) was cloned into the inducible vector pMT/V5-His A for secreted C-His-tagged protein expression using ApaI and BglII restriction sites. After co-transfection with pCoHygro into Schneider Drosophila S2 cells (Invitrogen), stably transfected S2 cells were cultivated without serum. Protein expression was induced by administration of 500 μm CuSO4 to the cells, and cell supernatant was collected and stored at –80 °C until protein purification. For protein purification, cell supernatant was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and then incubated with an appropriate amount of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen AG, Hilden, Germany) for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing with a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, the resin-bound protein was eluted with a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, concentrated (Amicon R Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices 10,000 molecular weight cut-off; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and then dialyzed against PBS. Protein concentration was measured using Total Protein Kit Micro (Sigma). Purified protein was stored at –20 °C until further use. Endotoxin levels were below the detection limit in both human and mouse soluble JAM-C. Cell Adhesion Assay—Adhesion of neutrophils to cultured HUVEC was tested as previously described (29Chavakis T. May A.E. Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 2976-2983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T. Nagashima M. Morser J. Arnold B. Preissner K.T. Nawroth P.P. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1507-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were grown to confluence on 96-well plates. Fluorescence-labeled neutrophils (105/well) were washed twice, followed by no pretreatment or by stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/ml). Cells were washed and added to HUVEC at 37 °C for 60 min in the absence or presence of inhibitors. After washing, adhesion of neutrophils was quantified as the percentage of total cells added using a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Neufahrn, Germany) (29Chavakis T. May A.E. Preissner K.T.

Adhesion of thioglycollate-elicited leukocytes from mice to immobilized mouse JAM-C (10 μg/ml) or adhesion of human neutrophils to immobilized human JAM-C (10 μg/ml) was performed as previously described (29Chavakis T.

Transmigration—Neutrophil transmigration was performed as previously described (32Rohnelt R.K. Hoch G. Reiss Y. Engelhardt B. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, transmigration assays were performed using 6.5-mm Transwells with an 8-μm pore size (Costar, Bodenheim, Germany). Inserts were coated with gelatin (Sigma). HUVEC were seeded on Transwell filters 2 days prior to the assay and grown without medium in the lower compartment for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere (37 °C, 5% CO2). At the beginning of the transmigration assay, 600 μlof migration assay medium (serum-free RPMI in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml MCP-1) was added to the lower compartment of the Transwell system. An aliquot of 100 μl of neutrophils (4 × 105) was added to the upper compartment on top of the endothelial monolayer. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the number of transmigrated cells in the lower compartment was estimated with a cell counter (CASY-Counter; Schärfe-System, Reutlingen, Germany). In Vivo Peritonitis Model—Thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in mice was performed as previously described (30Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T. Nagashima M. Morser J.

For inhibition studies, the following compounds (total volume 300 μl) were administered intraperitoneally 30–45 min or intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of thioglycollate: various concentrations of soluble recombinant mouse JAM-C; 100 μg of mAb against mouse Mac-1, mouse LFA-1, or mouse ICAM-1 in PBS; 100 μg of mouse fibronectin in PBS; or combinations of the inhibitors. Control mice were treated with the same volume of PBS or isotype-matched control antibodies (100 μg). In order to evaluate neutrophil recruitment, mice were sacrificed at 4 h following injection of thioglycollate. Thereafter, the peritoneal lavage was collected, and the number of emigrated neutrophils was quantitated as previously described (30Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T.

Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons between groups were analyzed by analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment (SPSS 11.5 software). p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. JAM-C Is Expressed by Endothelial Cells and Localizes at Interendothelial Junctions—We have previously shown that among various peripheral blood cells, JAM-C is expressed only on platelets (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Here, the expression of JAM-C was tested on endothelial cells. Surface expression of JAM-C on HUVEC was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A) and was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1B) and by analysis of JAM-C mRNA using RT-PCR (not shown). In order to investigate the localization of JAM-C on endothelial cells, we performed immunostaining analysis. JAM-C was found to localize at cell-cell contacts similar to proteins that are associated with tight junctions, such as ZO-1. Double staining indicated that JAM-C and ZO-1 colocalize at interendothelial contacts (Fig. 2). Together, endothelial cells express JAM-C that localizes at interendothelial junctions. The Role of JAM-C in Neutrophil Adhesion to and Transmigration through Endothelial Cell Monolayers—We previously demonstrated that JAM-C on platelets can function as a counter-receptor for the β2-integrin Mac-1 on neutrophils (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Since JAM-C is also expressed on endothelial cells and particularly in the interendothelial contacts, we studied whether JAM-C can mediate neutrophil adhesion to and transmigration through endothelial cells. Neutrophil adhesion to an endothelial monolayer was mediated by the β2-integrins Mac-1 and LFA-1 and their endothelial counter-receptor ICAM-1, since antibodies against β2-integrin, Mac-1, LFA-1, or ICAM-1 blocked the interaction. In contrast, soluble JAM-C or an antibody against PECAM-1 did not affect neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells (Fig. 3). On the other hand, neutrophil transmigration through HUVEC was blocked by mAb against Mac-1. In contrast to neutrophil adhesion to HUVEC, transmigration was inhibited in the presence of soluble JAM-C or mAb Gi18 against domains 1 and 2 of PECAM-1 (Fig. 4A), whereby previous studies demonstrated that mAb Gi18 could inhibit the homophilic interaction of PECAM-1 molecules (26Kroll H. Sun Q.H. Santoso S. Blood. 2000; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A control soluble protein, fibronectin, as well as a control antibody, mAb against αvβ3-integrin that bind to the neutrophil surface, did not interfere with transmigration. Moreover, the combined blockade of PECAM-1 and JAM-C almost completely abolished transmigration of neutrophils. The same phenomenon was also observed when the combination of antibodies against PECAM-1 and Mac-1 was engaged (Fig. 4A). Thus, an additive inhibitory effect of mAb against PECAM-1 with either soluble JAM-C or mAb against Mac-1 was observed.Fig. 4Role of JAM-C in neutrophil transendothelial migration. A, the trans-endothelial migration of human neutrophils toward 50 ng/ml MCP-1 is shown in the absence (–) or presence of mAb to Mac-1, mAb to LFA-1, mAb to αvβ3, human fibronectin (FN), mAb to PECAM-1, soluble human JAM-C (each at 20 μg/ml), or combinations thereof. Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) of a typical experiment; similar results were observed in three separate experiments. *, p < 0.003; ns, not significant as compared with control (–; absence of competitors). #, p < 0.02; +, p < 0.05. B, the transmigration of human neutrophils across a bare filter (filter coated with gelatin without endothelial cells) was performed in the absence (–) or presence of mAb to Mac-1, mAb to PECAM-1, or soluble human JAM-C (each at 20 μg/ml). Transmigration is presented as a percentage of control (only MCP-1, in the absence of competitor). Data are mean ± S.D. (n = 3) of a typical experiment, and similar results were observed in three separate experiments. *, p < 0.05; ns, not significant as compared with control (–, absence of competitors). C, molecular size analysis of soluble JAM-C protein was performed under nondenaturing conditions in 10% polyacrylamide gels in the absence of SDS and mercaptoethanol and was visualized by Western blotting with mAb Gi11 against JAM-C (left panel) or by silver staining (right panel). Lanes 1, negative control; lanes 2, 0.75 μg of JAM-C; lanes 3, 1.75 μg of JAM-C. The positions of JAM-C multimers are indicated by arrows; size markers are indicated along the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to exclude the possibility that JAM-C interferes with neutrophil Mac-1 at a later stage of neutrophil migration through the transwell filter, we have performed neutrophil transmigration in response to MCP-1 through a bare filter (filter coated with gelatin without endothelial cells). In this case, neutrophil transmigration was partially blocked by mAb against Mac-1. In contrast, neither the mAb against PECAM-1 nor soluble JAM-C inhibited the migration of neutrophils through the bare filter (Fig. 4B). From these data, we conclude that soluble JAM-C interferes with Mac-1 at the stage of neutrophil transmigration across the endothelial cells but not at a later stage of neutrophil migration through the transwell filter. Moreover, the concentration of soluble JAM-C effective in inhibition of transendothelial migration of neutrophils was relatively low provided that JAM-C is present as a monovalent soluble adhesion molecule. We therefore tested whether our preparations of soluble JAM-C contained aggregated forms of the molecule. When soluble JAM-C was analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, the majority of the protein migrated as multimers at a position between 80 and 90 kDa (Fig. 4C). From these data, we conclude that soluble JAM-C has the propensity to form multimers that provide the basis for the profound inhibitory effect at relatively low concentrations, comparable with the used monoclonal antibodies. In order to test whether soluble JAM-C blocks neutrophil transendothelial migration due to interference with the interaction between Mac-1 on neutrophils and endothelial JAM-C, we tested adhesion of neutrophils to plate-immobilized JAM-C. Neutrophil adhesion to JAM-C was blocked by blocking mAb against Mac-1 but not by mAb against LFA-1. This is in accordance with our previous findings that Mac-1 but not LFA-1 interacts with JAM-C (22Santoso S. Sachs U.J. Kroll H. Linder M. Ruf A. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Moreover, binding of neutrophils to plate-immobilized JAM-C was blocked by soluble JAM-C (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data suggest that the heterophilic interaction between Mac-1 and JAM-C may be involved in neutrophil transendothelial migration. Participation of JAM-C in Neutrophil Recruitment in Acute Peritonitis in Mice—To test whether JAM-C participates in neutrophil recruitment in vivo, we studied its role in a mouse model of acute inflammation. Peritonitis was induced by thioglycollate injection, and after 4 h, there was the expected increase in the total leukocyte count in the peritoneum, mostly attributable to emigrated neutrophils. The portion of neutrophils among all leukocytes after 4 h was 50–60% as compared with 3–5% 1 h following stimulation (30Chavakis T. Bierhaus A. Al-Fakhri N. Schneider D. Witte S. Linn T. Nagashima M.

A major factor contributing to drug resistance in cancer is the over-expression of P-glycoprotein, a plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux pump. Three-dimensional structural data with a resolution limit of ∼8 Å have been obtained from two-dimensional crystals of P-glycoprotein trapped in the nucleotide-bound state. Each of the two transmembrane domains of P-glycoprotein consists of six long α-helical segments. Five of the α-helices from each transmembrane domain are related by a pseudo-2-fold symmetry, whereas the sixth breaks the symmetry. The two α-helices positioned closest to the (pseudo-) symmetry axis at the center of the molecule appear to be kinked. A large loop of density at the extracellular surface of the transporter is likely to correspond to the glycosylated first extracellular loop, whereas two globular densities at the cytoplasmic side correspond to the hydrophilic, nucleotide-binding domains. This is the first three-dimensional structure for an intact eukaryotic ABC transporter.

The minimal functional unit of an ABC transporter typically consists of four domains, two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two transmembrane domains (TMDs), each consisting of several (frequently six) putative membrane-spanning α-helices. X-ray crystallography-derived structures of two bacterial ABC transporters (MsbA and BtuCD) have recently been published (1Chang G. Roth C.B.

No significant structural homology between the TMDs of the two transporters was observed. Indeed BtuCD has 20 membrane-spanning α-helices, whereas MsbA has 12.

In this study we present the three-dimensional structure for P-gp at ∼8Å resolution obtained by cryo-electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals. These structural data are the highest resolution for any eukaryotic ABC transporter and the first to show the location and packing of the transmembrane α-helices. This structure was obtained in the presence of bound nucleotide, enabling a new conformational state of an ABC transporter to be assessed. Chinese hamster P-gp was purified using dodecyl maltoside and two-dimensional crystals produced by vapor diffusion at the air/water interface of hanging droplets containing protein, buffer, precipitant, and a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP) as described previously (11Rosenberg M.F.

Grids were embedded in 2% (w/v) glucose and transferred at liquid-nitrogen temperatures into a Gatan cryotransfer specimen holder and observed at ∼100 K in a Philips CM200 FEG electron microscope operated at 200 kV acceleration voltage. Images were recorded with a 1- or 2-s exposure time under low dose conditions at a magnification of ×38,000 on Kodak SO-163 film and developed for 12 min with full strength Kodak D19 developer. Micrographs were screened by optical diffraction. Areas of 2048 × 2048 pixels were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a 7-μm step size or a UMAX Powerlook 3000 scanner with an 8-μm step size. Images were processed using Medical Research Council image-processing programs (20Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). After three cycles of lattice unbending and then correction for contrast transfer function, amplitude and phase data were merged (see Table I). Images were recorded over a broad tilt range and over a large range of defocus values (-200 nm to -1500 nm). Projection maps and three-dimensional density maps were generated using the CCP4 software programs (21Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A map calculated with a low temperature factor of -40 Å2 was used initially for identification of the molecular envelope and approximate location of the NBDs. A map calculated with a higher temperature factor of -200 Å2 was then employed for a more precise placement of α-helices using manual alignment to continuous cylindrical densities and using the “xfit” routines within the XtalView package (22McRee D.E.

The crystals were well ordered with strong reflections to 8 Å resolution for both untilted and highly tilted crystals (Fig. 1), whereas weaker reflections could be detected to 6 Å resolution. The flatness of the crystals was good as determined by checking for any systematic deviation of the lattice parameters for several 2048 × 2048 pixel boxes over large crystalline areas. The final resolution limit of the data was judged to be ∼6 Å in the direction parallel to the crystal plane and 12 Å perpendicular to the crystal plane. These judgments were based on phase errors, figure of merit, and percentage of completeness over increasing resolution ranges as detailed in Table I together with a visual assessment of the degree of scatter of phases along continuous lattice lines in the z* direction in reciprocal space (Fig. 2). The three-dimensional sampling of reciprocal space is 70-80% complete within the tilt range employed to about 11 Å resolution and falls off to about 50% completeness to 8.5 Å resolution (Table I). However, sampling of data is reduced considerably beyond this point; between 8.5 and 7.2 Å resolution only ∼11% of expected structure factors are measured with a figure of merit >0.1, indicating the current resolution limit of these three-dimensional data.

Fitting of α-helices and NBDs is shown by the yellow C-α traces. A and B show side views of the map (the yellow scale bar represents 20 Å). B is related to A by a 90° rotation around the vertical axis as indicated at the top of each panel. Molecules are packed in the crystal with the longest axis of the protein tilted at an angle of ∼35° from the perpendicular with respect to the crystal plane direction (indicated by the double-headed arrow in each panel). The locations of the TMDs, ICDs, and NBDs are indicated by the arrows and dashed lines. The putative extracellular loop (ECL) is indicated at the top of the panels. C-E show sections through the map corresponding to the positions of the pink arrows in B. The viewing direction is perpendicular to the crystal plane from the intracellular side. A roughly elliptical profile is observed in D and E, with two clusters of densities (segregated by the red dashed lines).

A similarly shaped projection map has also been observed with negatively stained two-dimensional crystals of CFTR with nucleotide bound (17Rosenberg M.F. Kamis A.B. Aleksandrov L.A. Ford R.C.

Fig. 3B shows the P-gp map with a high resolution cut off at the 6 Å resolution limit of these data. Several strong elliptical or round peaks of density of ∼10 Å diameter can be seen, consistent with densities expected for transmembrane α-helices. The three-dimensional density map of P-gp is displayed in Fig. 4. Two orthogonal views from a direction perpendicular to the long molecular axis are shown in A and B, respectively. Views from a direction perpendicular to the crystal plane are shown in C-E. Each view corresponds to a section of density ∼30 Å thick. The blue three-dimensional netting drawn at a threshold of 1.5 times the standard deviation above the mean density level indicates strong protein density. The approximate envelope of one P-gp molecule within the density map is delineated by a dashed white line. The P-gp molecules in these crystals were packed so that their long molecular axes subtend an angle of about 35° to the normal to the crystal plane (the direction of the crystal plane is indicated by the double-headed arrows in A and B). The molecule is ∼160 Å long and 45 × 65 Å wide, dimensions that are similar to those obtained for P-gp and for three other ABC transporters (Pdr5p, YvcC, and CFTR) obtained by low resolution structural studies (10Rosenberg M.F.

Twelve cylindrical densities were observed in the central region of the 8 Å-resolution three-dimensional map, each ∼50-75 Å long and ∼10 Å in diameter (Fig. 4, A and B). These features were clear at high thresholds equivalent to two times standard deviation (2σ) above the mean density in the map and could be modeled as α-helical segments within the transmembrane domains (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Chang G.

The length of most of these cylindrical densities was 15-20 Å greater than that required to span the lipid bilayer. Hydrophilic intracytoplasmic loops of the TMDs (the so-called intracytoplasmic domains or ICDs) were observed as helical extensions of the membrane-spanning α-helices in MsbA (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which interact directly with the NBDs. In contrast, BtuCD does not contain α-helical ICDs, and the contacts between transmembrane domains and NBDs are mediated by structured loops (2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The lengths of the cylindrical densities observed in P-gp suggest that it has ICD helical extensions similar to MsbA (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The long axes of the putative α-helices were approximately parallel to the long axis of the molecule and formed a ∼70 Å-thick belt across its center with a roughly elliptical profile of 60 × 40 Å (Fig. 4C). Only one putative α-helix was significantly tilted away from the long molecular axis. This elongated density was found to cross from one half of the molecule to contact the other half (see Fig. 5B, helix indicated by arrowhead). The 12 cylindrical densities of sufficient length to span the membrane are seen to be segregated into two clusters of six, presumably corresponding to the two TMDs, when viewed along the long axis of the protein (dashed line in D). Their packing is discussed in more detail below. The crystal surface in contact with the electron microscope grid support film has previously been assigned to the extracellular, glycosylated face of the P-gp molecule (10Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R.

This side of the crystal (Fig. 4C and the uppermost region in A and B) contained densities which are partly folded back over the top of the molecule (A, arrowhead), probably corresponding to the single large extracellular loop of P-gp and can be modeled as two α-helices (Fig. 4C). It seems likely that glycosylation also contributes to this density. The region furthest away from the support film in the three-dimensional crystals corresponding to the cytoplasmic side of the molecule (10Rosenberg M.F. Callaghan R. Ford R.C. Higgins C.F. J. Biol.

The β-strands and short α-helices of the NBDs will be poorly resolved in an 8 Å resolution map, and their identification will also be impeded by the fading of density toward the edges of the map because of the missing cone problem associated with two-dimensional crystallography (20Crowther R.A.

Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) can both be modeled onto the P-gp density map in a robust manner and in almost identical positions, suggesting that the arrangement of the NBDs with respect to the TMDs in P-gp is not radically different from either of them at this resolution. The model for the NBDs shown in Figs. 4 and 5 is based on the MJ0796 dimer in the ATP-bound state (9Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). We have generated the first three-dimensional structure for P-gp at 8 Å resolution, and its interpretation is summarized in Fig. 5. The overall space-filling volume is shown in A, whereas B-D show the transmembrane region of the transporter with α-helices represented by spiral ribbons. In cross-section, the molecule has an overall clover leaf shape (B, dashed line) similar to the low resolution envelope (Fig. 3) determined previously by other methods (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 12Rosenberg M.F.

Twelve transmembrane α-helices of sufficient length to span the membrane are seen in two blocks of six exhibiting a pseudo-2-fold symmetry as expected given the sequence homology between the two TMDs of the transporter. Pseudo-symmetry-related α-helices are shown in the same color, whereas α-helices with no apparent pseudo-symmetry-related partner are colored gray. The pseudo-symmetry-related halves of the TMDs are compared in Fig. 5, C and D after rotation of one half by 180° around the pseudo-2-fold axis. Five α-helices (dashed enclosure) from each TMD are clearly repeated in each of the two halves of the transporter. The sixth pair of α-helices (B-D, yellow helices) that make up the 12 transmembrane α-helices show a less symmetrical relationship. One is tilted so that it crosses over to contact the other TMD, whereas its partner aligns roughly parallel to the other long α-helical segments (C and D, arrows). Four further densities, fitted as short α-helices, are unrelated by the symmetry of the transporter (A and B, gray helices) and are probably not membrane-spanning. Two of these densities (A, top) likely correspond to the major extracellular loop in P-gp, whereas one (B, asterisk) is tilted well away from the long axis of the molecule and is too short to cross the membrane. The final density (A and B, X) lies at the interface between adjacent unit cells, contacting the TMD region of one unit cell and the extracellular surface of P-gp of the adjacent unit cell. There are therefore two possible locations of this density (as indicated by X, A) which cannot be distinguished as full tracing of the polypeptide chain is unfeasible at the current resolution limits. The deviation from true 2-fold symmetry in the TMD region is likely to be a consequence of conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C.

Low resolution (20 Å) maps of P-gp in the nucleotide-free configuration have a more pronounced 2-fold (pseudo)-symmetry and display a cavity in the membrane (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C.

Similar conformational states have been observed in a related ABC transporter, CFTR (17Rosenberg M.F. Kamis A.B. Aleksandrov L.A. Ford R.C. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39051-39057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), reinforcing the original conclusions for P-gp. The present 8 Å-resolution structure agrees well with the (lower resolution) structure of P-gp in negatively stained crystals grown in the presence of nucleotide. Cryo-electron microscopy studies of P-gp in the nucleotide-free state are now needed to describe with greater precision the nature and magnitude of the conformational changes induced by nucleotide binding. For the time being, a comparison of 20 Å- and 8 Å-resolution structures for the nucleotide-free and -bound states, respectively, concurs with the original interpretation (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5615-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) that the conformational change opens out a central cavity in the TMD region of the P-gp structure. These and other studies have suggested that the conformational changes mediate transport of substances by these transporters (2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C.

Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Higgins C.F. Kerr I.D. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 18232-18238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These studies frequently place transmembrane α-helices 6 and 12 (TM6 and TM12) close to each other, especially at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, and these helices have been implicated in drug binding (36Loo T.W. Bartlett C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31945-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The two α-helices at the center of the protein (Fig. 5B, green helices) are therefore good candidates for TM6 and TM12. These are closer at the bottom (cytoplasmic side) where they are probably in van der Waals contact in agreement with cross-linking data (24Stenham D.R. Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Higgins C.F. Kerr I.D. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These helices also display a kink or discontinuity in the density about halfway through the membrane. Interestingly, mutations in a similar position in TM6 and TM12 cause significant loss of activity in the transporter (38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical data have shown that upon ATP binding (AMP-PNP) TM6 tilts with respect to other helices (39Rothnie A. Storm J. Campbell J. Linton K.J. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34913-34921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) consistent with the prediction that the tilted helix at the center of the structure (Fig. 5, green helices) is indeed TM6. TM5 and TM8 have also been shown by cross-linking to be near to each other, as have α-helices TM2 and TM11 (34Loo T.W. Bartlett C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7692-7697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 35Loo T.W. Bartlett C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18232-18238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is not, however, possible at this resolution to predict which of the α-helices in the P-gp structure reflect the TM5/TM8 and TM2/TM11 pairs. As expected from the sequence homology between P-gp and the bacterial ABC transporter MsbA, the packing of the transmembrane helices observed here for P-gp is not inconsistent with that reported for the MsbA monomer (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 24Stenham D.R. Campbell J.D.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3666-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Differences are likely to be a consequence of the fact that the P-gp structure has bound nucleotide, known to cause significant conformational changes in the transmembrane domains (11Rosenberg M.F. Velarde G.S. Ford R.C. Martin C. Berridge G. Kerr I.D. Callaghan R. Schmidlin A. Wooding C. Linton K.J. Higgins C.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 8294-8299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, the packing of the two halves of the molecule in P-gp with respect to each other is very different from the tapering or “teepee” arrangement reported for the MsbA homodimer (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus, the interface between the two TMDs in P-gp is much more extensive than in the Escherichia coli MsbA homodimer. Molecular dynamics simulations of E. coli MsbA (29Campbell J.D. Biggin P.C. Baaden M. Sansom M.S.P.

Campbell and M. S. P. Sansom, personal communication. Indeed, the overall shape of P-gp is similar to the BtuCD homodimer (2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) where the interface between the monomers is extensive and the long axes of each monomer line up side by side. We also find that the P-gp NBDs in the AMP-PNP bound state are arranged similarly to those in the BtuD dimer (2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and the MJ0796 dimer with ATP bound (9Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol.

Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The NBDs in the Vibrio cholera MsbA structure (3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) are in contact and therefore are closer to the arrangement in the P-gp map, but they still display major differences in their structure with respect to the other isolated NBD structures (4Kerr I.D.

In summary, the structural data for P-gp support the suggestion (24Stenham D.R. Campbell J.D. Sansom M.S.P. Higgins C.F. Kerr I.D. Linton K.J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that the MsbA homodimer structure does not reflect the native domain interfaces for this subfamily of ABC transporters. The structure described herein provides a further insight into the packing of transmembrane α-helices in ABC transporters and shows a novel asymmetric conformational state (nucleotide-bound) that will be important for developing molecular models of P-gp and ABC transporter mechanisms of action (24Stenham D.R.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3666-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This represents the first three-dimensional structure for a eukaryotic ABC transporter and the fourth structure of any ABC transporter at a resolution sufficient to resolve the packing of the transmembrane α-helices (1Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 2Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In P-gp/MsbA and BtuCD, members of two distinct subfamilies of ABC transporters, the packing of the transmembrane α-helices is very different. It remains to be seen whether ABC transporters will display a wide range of folds for the TMDs or whether some structural consensus will emerge.

Previous studies using knock-out mice showed that the hearts of animals lacking one copy of the α1 or α2 isoform gene exhibit opposite phenotypes. Hearts from α2+/– animals are hypercontractile, whereas those of the α1+/– animals are hypocontractile. The cardiac phenotype of the α1+/– animals was unexpected as other studies suggest that inhibition of either isoform increases contraction. To help resolve this difference, we have used genetically engineered knock-in mice expressing a ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform and a ouabain-resistant α2 isoform of the Na,K-ATPase, and we analyzed cardiac contractility following selective inhibition of the α1 isoform by ouabain. Administration of ouabain to these animals and to isolated heart preparations selectively inhibits only the activity of the α1 isoform without affecting the activity of the α2 isoform. Low concentrations of ouabain resulted in positive cardiac inotropy in both isolated hearts and intact animals expressing the modified α1 and α2 isoforms. Pretreatment with 10 μm KB-R7943, which inhibits the reverse mode of the Na/Ca exchanger, abolished the cardiotonic effects of ouabain in isolated wild type and knock-in hearts. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated co-localization of the α1 isoform and the Na/Ca exchanger in cardiac sarcolemma. The α1 isoform co-immunoprecipitated with the Na/Ca exchanger and vice versa. These results demonstrate that the α1 isoform regulates cardiac contractility, and that both the α1 and α2 isoforms are functionally and physically coupled with the Na/Ca exchanger in heart.

These results demonstrate that the α1 isoform regulates cardiac contractility, and that both the α1 and α2 isoforms are functionally and physically coupled with the Na/Ca exchanger in heart. Active Na+ transport across the cardiac sarcolemma, driven by the Na,K-ATPase, is an important regulator of cardiac function (1Pieske B. Houser S.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Pieske B. Houser S.R. Hasenfuss G. Bers D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The intracellular Na+ concentration affects a number of physiological processes in cardiac myocytes, including intracellular Ca2+ handling, contraction-relaxation processes, pH regulation, energy metabolism, and cell growth (1Pieske B. Houser S.R. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Pieske B. Houser S.R. Hasenfuss G. Bers D.M. Cardiovasc.

Res. 2003; 57: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase is a heterodimer composed of α and β subunits (3Lingrel J.B Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α subunit is the catalytic subunit, and it binds translocating cations and ATP. The α subunit is also the pharmacological receptor for cardiac glycosides. These compounds inhibit Na,K-ATPase activity and are used in the treatment of congestive heart failure. There are four isoforms of the α subunit, each with a distinct tissue distribution and developmental pattern of expression, suggestive of their differential and tissue-specific functional roles (4Sweadner K.J.

Depending on the species, different combinations of these α isoforms are present in heart. The α1 and α2 isoforms are expressed in rodent heart, whereas three isoforms (α1, α2, and α3) are expressed in human heart (5Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10436-10442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jewell E.A. Shamraj O.I. Lingrel J.B Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1992; 607: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar, 11Shamraj O.I. Melvin D. Lingrel J.B Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As multiple isoforms are expressed in heart, it is possible that they play different biological roles. Previous studies using knock-out mice showed that the hearts of animals lacking one copy of the α1or α2 isoform gene exhibit opposite phenotypes (6James P.F. Grupp I.L. Grupp G. Woo A.L. Askew G.R. Croyle M.L. Walsh R.A. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 555-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The hearts from α2+/– animals, in which α2 levels were reduced by 50%, were hypercontractile, whereas those of the α1+– animals, in which α1 levels were reduced by 40%, were hypocontractile. Calcium transients were increased in α2+– cardiac myocytes but were unchanged in α1+– myocytes, suggesting that reduced levels of the α2 isoform, but not α1 isoform, affect Ca2+ handling. Furthermore, administration of ouabain to the hypocontractile α1+– hearts led to a positive inotropic response. On the basis of these data, it was proposed that the α2 isoform mediates positive cardiac inotropy, whereas the α1 isoform mediates the toxic effects of cardiac glycosides. A number of studies re-enforced the importance of the α2 isoform in the regulation of Ca2+ transients during contraction (7He S. Shelly D.A. Moseley A.E. James P.F. James J.H. Paul R.J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: C475-C486Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also, we confirmed that the α2 isoform mediates the positive cardiac inotropy observed at low concentrations of ouabain, by comparing the effect of ouabain on cardiac contractility in wild type hearts expressing the ouabain-sensitive α2 isoform with that in hearts expressing a genetically modified, ouabain-resistant α2 isoform (13Dostanic I.

Several reports suggest that the α1 isoform modulates cardiac contractility differently than that proposed based on the hypo-contractile cardiac phenotype in the isolated α1+– hearts (14McDonough A.A. Zhang Y. Shin V. Frank J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1221-C1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zahler R. Sun W. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Am. J.

The high expression of the α1 isoform in T-tubules of rat cardiac myocytes suggests that it has a major role in the regulation of cardiac contractility (14McDonough A.A. Zhang Y. Shin V. Frank J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1221-C1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zahler R. Sun W. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C361-C371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increased contraction of isolated rat cardiac myocytes has been attributed to a reduction in α1 isoform expression through dominant negative interference with a fragment of the α2 isoform (16Kometiani P. Askari A. Liu J. Xie Z. Askari F.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1415-H1421Google Scholar). However, in these cardiac myocytes a reduction in the expression of the α3 isoform was also detected, which could contribute to the enhanced contractility. Also a biphasic ouabain dose response in isolated rodent heart preparations is well established, and the positive inotropic effect of high concentrations of ouabain has been accounted for by inhibition of the low affinity α1 isoform (17Schwartz A. Petrashevskaya N.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Kang W. Weiss M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 577-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, as this second phase of inhibition always occurs following inhibition of the α2 isoform, it is uncertain whether this pre-dispositions the heart to further contraction following inhibition of the α1 isoform. To address directly and unambiguously the role of the α1 isoform, we developed animals in which the α1 isoform is ouabain-sensitive and the α2 isoform is ouabain-resistant, and we analyzed cardiac contractility following administration of ouabain that would inhibit only the α1 isoform without altering the α2 isoform. The present study demonstrates that the α1 isoform regulates cardiac contractility and is functionally and physically coupled with the Na/Ca exchanger. Generation of a Mice Expressing the Cardiac Glycoside-sensitive α1 and α2 Isoforms of Na,K-ATPase—The R111Q and D122N amino acid substitutions were introduced into the α1 isoform by 2-bp mutations in exon 4 by using PCR site-directed mutagenesis, as shown in Fig. 1. Furthermore, 2 silent base pair substitutions were made to introduce an EcoRI site. The LoxP-neomycin-LoxP cassette was cloned into intron 3 at a site 750 bp upstream of exon 4. The thymidine kinase gene was inserted downstream of the cloning sequence. The presence of the desired mutation in the targeting vector was verified by both sequence analysis and EcoRI restriction digestion. The Duffy ES cell line was transfected with the targeting vector by electroporation, and successful homologous recombination was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The 5′ probe was derived from intron 3, and the 3 ′ probe was derived from intron 4 of the α1 isoform gene. The presence of the EcoRI site and desired mutation in exon 4 was determined in successfully targeted ES cells by PCR using the P1 (5′-AGCTCAGGACATTCTGG) and the P2 (5′-CTCCTAACCACGCTCCTAG) primers, and the amplified exon 4 fragments were treated with EcoRI restriction enzyme. Successfully targeted ES cells were subjected to the second electroporation with the Cre-recombinase encoding vector. Following the transfection, ES clones were duplicated, and one set was grown in media supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. Genomic DNA was extracted from the neomycin-sensitive ES cells, digested with EcoRI, and analyzed by Southern blot using the 3′ and 5′ probes described above. The presence of the EcoRI site, and therefore the presence of the desired mutation, in exon 4 was analyzed in targeted ES cells by PCR, as described above. Chimeric mice were generated via blastocyst injection of the positive ES cell clone and were bred to Black Swiss mice for two generations to establish a hybrid line. Homozygous knock-in mice were obtained by heterozygous mating. Genotyping was performed by allele-specific PCR analysis across the LoxP site in intron 3 of the genomic DNA. The presence of the mutation in homozygous α1S/S α2S/S mice was verified by sequence analysis of exon 4 using the P1 and the P2 primers described above. Crude Microsomal Preparations—Crude microsomal preparations were used for both Western blot analysis and [3H]ouabain binding assays and were prepared as described previously (19Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), omitting NaI treatment. Briefly, for each preparation, tissues were pooled from three animals and homogenized twice on ice for 30 s in 2 ml of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm imidazole, and 1 mm EDTA). Homogenates were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged at 40,800 rpm for 1 h by using an SW 50.1 Beckman rotor. Following ultracentrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA buffer and stored at –80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation—The membranes from heart were solubilized with the non-ionic detergent IGEPAL CA-630 as described previously (20Lencesova L. O'Neill A. Resneck W.G. Bloch R.J. Blaustein M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2885-2893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was also performed as described previously (20Lencesova L. O'Neill A. Resneck W.G. Bloch R.J. Blaustein M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2885-2893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, appropriate monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies were incubated with magnetic beads coated with the appropriate secondary antibodies (Dynabeats; M-450 anti-mouse goat and M-280 anti-rabbit sheep) overnight at 4 °C. The following specific primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Na/Ca exchanger, NCX (Affinity Bioreagents), mouse anti-α1 isoform (α6F, University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybrid Bank), and rabbit anti-α2 isoform (Dr. McDouhgna). Following this incubation, antibody attached beads were washed (three times) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following washing, the antibody-coated beads were incubated with 1 mg of the detergent-soluble fraction of heart plasma membrane for 4 h at 4 °C. Asa negative control, 1 mg of the detergent-soluble fraction of heart plasma membrane was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with Dynabeats coated with the appropriate secondary IgG. Following this incubation, the supernatant was saved and designated as post-immunoprecipitated fraction. The bead complex was washed four times with PTA (145 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium azide, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.0). Immunoprecipitated proteins were extracted with Laemmli Sample Buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.9), 5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue) by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed via standard methods (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in Laemmli Sample Buffer and separated by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked in 1% nonfat dry milk in TBST (5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated in TBST containing α1 isoform-specific monoclonal antibody (α6F, University of Iowa Developmental Studies Hybrid Bank), α2 isoform-specific monoclonal HERED antibody (Dr. Alicia McDonough), α3 isoform-specific monoclonal MA3–915 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and KETTY polyclonal antibody that recognized the C-terminal KETTY sequence of all α isoforms (Dr. Jack Kyte) at 4 °C overnight. For Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins, additional antibodies were used as follows: mouse anti-Na/Ca exchanger, NCX (Affinity Bioreagents), mouse anti-plasma membrane Ca-ATPase 1 (Affinity Bioreagents), and mouse anti-dihydropyridine receptor α2, DHPR 1The abbreviations used are: DHPR, dihydropyridine receptor; ES, embryonic stem cell; NCX, Na/Ca exchanger; PMCA 1, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1. α2 (Affinity Bioreagents). After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch), immunoreactivity was visualized following treatment with the ECL™ Western blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) by using the Kodak BioMax MR x-ray film. Analysis of Total [3H]Ouabain Binding—Total [3H]ouabain binding was performed as described previously (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–500 μg of crude membrane preparations were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h in a reaction mixture containing 20 μm [3H]ouabain, 10 mm sodium metavanadate, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm Tris-PO4, and either 0 or 30 μm unlabeled ouabain. Following incubation, the crude membrane preparations were filtered through the 1.2-μm glass microfiber Whatman GF/C filter paper and washed five times with 7 ml of water using a Brandel cell harvester. The filter-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific [3H]ouabain for each microsomal preparation was determined using an excess of unlabeled ouabain (1 mm), and this value was subtracted from total binding obtained using 30 μm ouabain. Subtraction of nonspecific binding from total binding obtained in kidney samples from both genotypes and in heart and skeletal muscle samples from targeted animals resulted in a value of zero. Na,K-ATPase Activity—The Na,K-ATPase activity was performed as described previously (21Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay medium for Na,K-ATPase activity contained 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 50 mm choline-Cl, 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2 (20 °C), ∼1 μg/ml of membrane protein, and different concentrations of ouabain. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 30 min, and the released Pi was determined by the colorimetric method at 660 nm, using malachite green/ammonium molybdate solution. Total ATPase activity was calculated as the difference in activity observed in the presence of 0 and 0.1 mm ouabain. The ouabain dose-response curve was obtained at increasing concentrations of ouabain, ranging from 0 to 0.1 mm. Analysis of Cardiovascular Performance in Intact Closed-chest Animals—The analysis in intact animals was performed as described previously (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The mean arterial pressure was measured using a low-compliance pressure transducer (COBE Cardiovascular; Arvada, CO). A high fidelity, 1.8-French Millar Mikro-Tip transducer (model SPR-612; Millar Instruments, TX) in the left ventricle was used as the monitor. Dobutamine and ouabain were infused through the cannulated right femoral vein. Mean arterial pressure and intraventricular pressure from the COBE transducer and the Miller transducer were analyzed using the MacLab4/s data acquisition system connected to a Macintosh 7100/80 computer. Average values for heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and systolic left ventricular pressure were measured from the pressure waveforms and were determined for each animal from at least 50 consecutive beats during the final 30 s of each 3-min dosage period. Maximum dP/dt and dP/dt at 40 mm Hg (dP/dt40) for dobutamine and ouabain infusions were calculated from the first derivative of the pressure waveforms. Work-performing (Anterograde) Mouse Heart Analysis—Cardiac contractile parameters were also obtained using a work-performing heart apparatus as described previously (22Grupp I.L. Subramaniam A.

All cardiac measurements were taken with mean aortic pressure fixed at 50 mm Hg and venous return fixed at 5 ml/min (left ventricular minute work = 250 mm Hg × ml/min). Coronary flow was measured with a Transonic flowmeter (model T206). Temperature was continuously monitored via a Physi-temp probe (Thermalert model TH-8) and was kept at 37.7 °C. Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Kreb's-Henseleit solution containing 2.0 mm Ca2+ (standard) or 1.5 mm Ca2+ (low), and base-line functional parameters were obtained at the different Ca2+ concentrations. The effects of ouabain on cardiac contractility and of KB-R7943 on ouabain-induced positive inotropy were assessed at 1.5 mm Ca2+. Increasing concentrations (1 × 10–9 to 8 × 10–4m) of ouabain, to produce a cumulative concentration response curve, were infused and mixed into the perfusate via catheters inserted into the aortic tubing 8 cm above the heart. The hearts were exposed to each concentration until the maximal effect was reached (usually a period of 5 min). The final concentration of ouabain delivered to the heart was calculated based on the stock concentration, infusion rate, and cardiac output. For analysis of with KB-R4973, hearts were perfused continuously with 10 μm KB-R7943 for 45 min, following which the ouabain dose-response curve was obtained. Statistical Analysis—Two-way analysis of variance for time and treatment with repeated measurements was performed, and post-hoc test of Fisher's least significant difference was obtained. Generation of Mice Expressing a Cardiac Glycoside-sensitive α1 Isoform of Na,K-ATPase—The ouabain sensitivity of the mouse α1 isoform was increased by introducing R111Q and D122N amino acid substitutions into the first extracellular domain of this isoform (Fig. 1). The Gln-111 and Asn-122 residues are naturally present in the high affinity human and sheep α1 isoforms and were shown previously to confer sensitivity to cardiac glycosides (23Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 24Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The R111Q and D122N substitutions were introduced by 2-bp mutations in exon 4 of the α1 isoform gene. In addition, an EcoRI restriction enzyme site was introduced as a silent mutation for easy identification of the targeted allele. The ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform mice were generated by the Cre/LoxP gene targeting strategy, as depicted in Fig. 1B. The strategy consists of two sequential ES cell transfections; the first transfection introduced the targeting sequence into one of the wild type alleles by homologous recombination. Homologous recombination resulted in heterozygous ES cell clones having a targeted allele containing the LoxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette and the desired R111Q and D122N mutations (data not shown). The second transfection introduced Cre-recombinase, which excised the neomycin resistance-conferring cassette from the targeted allele by recombination of two LoxP sites. Recombination generated heterozygous ES cells that retained the desired mutation in exon 4 (data not shown). Chimeric animals were generated by injecting the targeted ES cell clone into blastocysts that were then implanted into pseudopregnant SVJ/129 mice. The chimeric offspring were crossed to Black Swiss females to yield heterozygous α1R/S α2S/S animals. Through mating of heterozygous mice, wild type (α1R/R α2S/S), heterozygous (α1R/S α2S/S), and homozygous (α1S/S α2S/S) offspring were generated. These genotypes were born in expected Mendelian ratios. The α1S/S α2S/S animals retained the desired R111Q and D122N substitutions as shown by the sequence histogram of their genomic DNA (Fig. 1C). Generation of the α1S/S α2R/R Mice—Animals expressing the ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform and ouabain-resistant α2 isoform (α1S/S α2R/R) were developed by mating ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform mice (α1S/S α2S/S) with the ouabain-resistant α2 mice (α1R/R α2R/R) that were generated previously (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). This was possible as the genes encoding the α1 and α2 isoforms are on different chromosomes in mice (25Kent R.B. Fallows D.A. Geissler E. Glaser T. Emanuel J.R. Lalley P.A. Levenson R. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5369-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The homozygous α1S/S α2R/R mice were born in expected Mendelian ratios and developed normally to adulthood. Total [3H]ouabain binding in tissue preparations from the α1S/S α2R/R mice demonstrated an increase in the ouabain affinity of the α1 isoform and ouabain resistance of the α2 isoform (Fig. 2B). As expected, no [3H]ouabain binding was detected in kidney from wild type mice as only the low affinity α1 isoform is expressed. In contrast, high levels of ouabain binding were detected in kidney preparations expressing the modified α1 isoform. The ouabain binding was detected in wild type skeletal muscle and heart as these tissues express the ouabain-sensitive α2 isoform of Na,K-ATPase. The decrease in ouabain binding in skeletal muscle preparations from the α1S/S α2R/R mice reflects the reduction in the ouabain sensitivity of the α2 isoform, which is the major isoform in this tissue. This is consistent with our previous study demonstrating that the modification of the α2 isoform to a ouabain-resistant form completely abolishes ouabain binding in skeletal muscle from α1R/R α2R/R mice (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the α2 isoform is resistant to ouabain in double-knock-in animals, i.e. α1S/S α2R/R mice, more ouabain binding was detected in heart preparations from α1S/S α2R/R mice than from wild type. This reflects the increase in ouabain sensitivity of the α1 isoform and indicates that this isoform contributes more to the total levels of the Na,K-ATPase than the α2 isoform. By comparing the total ouabain binding in skeletal muscle and heart between the wild type and targeted mice, we determined the relative abundance of the α1 and α2 isoforms in these tissues. This is possible as in these tissues the total ouabain binding is contributed by the α2 isoform in wild type mice and by the α1 isoform in targeted mice. There was four times more ouabain bound in wild type skeletal muscle than in skeletal muscle from α1S/S α2R/R mice. Therefore, the α1 isoform comprises 20% and the α2 isoform 80% of total Na,K-ATPase in skeletal muscle. In contrast, there was 20 times more ouabain bound in α1S/S α2R/R heart than in wild type α1R/R α2S/S. Hence, the α1 isoform comprises 95.2% and the α2 isoform comprises 4.8% of total Na,K-ATPase in heart. Western blot analysis of the tissue from the wild type and α1S/S α2R/R mice demonstrated that the expression and tissue distribution of the α1 and α3 isoforms are normal in targeted animals (Fig. 2C). Although the tissue distribution of the α2 isoform was normal, there was a slight, but not significant, up-regulation in its expression in targeted heart preparations. This may be due to variability in the genetic background of these animals, as expression of the α2 isoform is normal in hearts from α1R/R α2R/R (13Dostanic I. Lorenz J.N. Schultz J.J. Grupp I.L. Neumann J.C. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 53026-53034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and α1S/S α2S/S (data not shown) mice. However, this slight alternation in the expression of the modified/ouabain-resistant α2 isoform could have not affected the analysis because we determined the"

How cells sense mechanical stimulation, however, is largely unknown. Most studies focus on cellular membrane proteins such as ion channels, integrins, and receptors for growth factors as mechanosensory units. Here we show that mechanical stretch-induced c-Src protein tyrosine kinase activation is mediated through the actin filament-associated protein (AFAP). Distributed along the actin filaments, AFAP can directly active c-Src through binding to its Src homology 3 and/or 2 domains. Mutations at these specific binding sites on AFAP blocked mechanical stretch-induced c-Src activation. Therefore, mechanical force can be transmitted along the cytoskeleton, and interaction between cytoskeletal associated proteins and enzymes related to signal transduction may convert physical forces into biochemical reactions. Cytoskeleton deformation-induced protein-protein interaction via specific binding sites may represent a novel intracellular mechanism for cells to sense mechanical stimulation.

Sensing external and internal stimuli is a vital sign of living organisms. Physical forces, derived from or applied to cells, are essential signals in determining cellular structure, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Physical forces are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes such as the maturation and branching of fetal lung (1Liu M. Post M. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the formation of ventricles and atriums of the heart, angiogenesis (2Ingber D.E. Circ.

Eng. 2000; 2: 691-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Exposure to abnormal forces contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases such as ventilator-associated lung injury (6Pinhu L.

Res. 2002; 91: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), etc. Over the last two decades, mechanotransduction has become an important area of research. How cells sense mechanical signals and convert them into biochemical reactions for signal transduction is one of the fundamental questions.Specialized mechanosensory structures have been developed through evolution, such as touch receptors in Caenorhabditis elegans (9Chalfie M. Biol. Bull. 1997; 192: 125Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 659-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and bristle receptors in Drosophila (11Kernan M. Cowan D. Zuker C.

Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstka R.F. Yang B. Williamson R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) have been extensively studied. Recently, the cell membrane proteins polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 have been found to mediate mechanosensation in the primary cilium of kidney cells (15Nauli S.M. Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). In these structures, transduction channels connected to intracellular and extracellular anchors control the entry of ions, thus converting a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal, an alteration of membrane potential (13Gillespie P.G. Walker R.G. Nature. 2001; 413: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).It has been believed that all cells in the body can respond to mechanical stimulation. How regular cells sense mechanical signals is unclear. Stretch-activated and -inactivated ion channels have been found in many cell types (16Yang X-C. Sachs F. Science. 1989; 243: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). In response to mechanical forces, opening and closing of these channels can activate intracellular signal transduction (17Hamill O.P. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 685-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). However, Sawada and Sheetz used a Triton buffer to remove cytoplasm and apical cellular membrane and then applied a transient mechanical stretch to the Triton-insoluble cytoskeleton. They demonstrated a stretch-dependent binding of paxillin, focal adhesion kinase (pp125FAK), and p130CAS to the cytoskeleton (18Sawada Y. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to ion channels there are other mechanisms that enable cells to sense physical forces. Cells attach to the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; AFAP, actin filament-associated protein; AFAP5Y, AFAP with mutants Y93F/Y94F/Y125F/Y451F/Y453F; AFAP71A, AFAP with mutant P71A; AFAP77A, AFAP with mutant P77A; cAFAP, chicken AFAP; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hAFAP, human AFAP; SH, Src homology; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; AFAP, actin filament-associated protein; AFAP5Y, AFAP with mutants Y93F/Y94F/Y125F/Y451F/Y453F; AFAP71A, AFAP with mutant P71A; AFAP77A, AFAP with mutant P77A; cAFAP, chicken AFAP; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; hAFAP, human AFAP; SH, Src homology; siRNA, small interfering RNA. via integrins that link to the cytoskeleton. This complex provides a structural connection allowing the transmission of physical forces from the ECM to the cell interior. There is increasing evidence to support the belief that integrins are mechanosensors (2Ingber D.E. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 8Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 769-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), but how physical forces are converted into biochemical signals through the ECM-integrin-cytoskeleton complex is not addressed by this model system. Recently, Tschumperlin et al. reported that compressive stress shrinks the lateral intercellular space surrounding epithelial cells and triggers cellular signaling via autocrine binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) family ligands to the EGF receptor (19Tschumperlin D.J. Dai G. Maly I.V. Kikuchi T. Laiho L.H. McVittie A.K. Haley K.J. Lilly C.M. So P.T. Lauffenburger D.A. Kamm R.D. Drazen J.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This observation again supports the importance of cellular membrane proteins in mechanosensory processes.We have previously found that mechanical stretch rapidly activates c-Src in fetal rat lung cells and that blocking stretch-induced activation of protein tyrosine kinases reduces stretch-mediated fetal lung cell proliferation (20Liu M. Qin Y. Liu J. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also noted that mechanical stretch increases the binding of c-Src to the actin filament-associated protein (AFAP) (20Liu M. Qin Y. Liu J. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Based on the molecular structure of c-Src and AFAP, we hypothesized that the cytoskeletal structure not only can transmit physical forces intracellularly but can also convert physical forces into biochemical reactions for signaling via specific binding sites. The present study tested this concept with supportive evidence that mechanical signals can be sensed intracellularly through protein-protein interaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Mechanical Stretch—The pCMV1 expression constructs for c-Src, chicken AFAP (cAFAP), and its mutants (AFAP71A, AFAP77A, and AFAP5Y) were gifts from Dr. Flynn (West Virginia University) (21Guappone A.C. Weimer T. Flynn D.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The full-length human AFAP (hAFAP) coding sequence was subcloned into the pCMV1 vector by replacing the resident KpnI-XbaI fragment of the pCMV-AFAP construct (21Guappone A.C. Weimer T. Flynn D.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-C3 eukaryotic expression vector (Clontech) was used to express cAFAP and its mutants fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) by shuttling cAFAP, AFAP71A, AFAP77A, and AFAP5Y sequences from pCMV vectors to pEGFP-C3 vector, respectively, using EcoRI subcloning sites (22Qian Y. Baisden J.M. Zot H.G. Van Winkle W.B. Flynn D.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed according to the nucleotides 311-331 of the human AFAP sequence (GenBank™ access number AF188700). The AFAP siRNA duplex with a sense sequence of 5′-GCUCCGAAUACAUCACAU(dTdT)-3′ and a non-specific control double-stranded RNA sequence of 5′-GAAUCCGCUGAUAAGUGAC(dTdT)-3′ were synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO).Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) overnight. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent for DNA and Oligofectamine for RNA transfections (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and harvested 60 h later. Cells, with or without transfection, cultured on collagen I- or ProNectin (a synthetic peptide fragment of fibronectin)-coated BioFlex plates were subjected to mechanical stretch (25% elongation, 60 cycles/min for 10 min) with a Flexercell Strain Unit, FX-2000™ (Flexcell International, Hillsborough, NC). Cells cultured on the same type of plates served as non-stretch controls.Western Blotting Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) containing 10 μg ml-1 each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm NaF. For isolating the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction, whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min. The insoluble pellets were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein content was determined by a standard protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates containing equal amount of total protein were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was conducted with antibodies against protein phosphotyrosine (4G10), Src (GD11) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), Src phosphotyrosines 416 and 527 (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA), and actin (AC-40) (Sigma) at 1:1,000 dilution. Polyclonal antibody against AFAP (F1) was a gift from Dr. Flynn and was used at 0.5 μg ml-1. Blots were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped off and re-probed with other antibodies.For immunoprecipitation, whole cell lysates containing 1 mg of total protein were adjusted to equal volume (1 ml) and incubated with designated antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were recovered by incubating with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (20%; w/v) for polyclonal antibodies or 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (10%; w/v) for monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Proteins were eluted by boiling the precipitates in sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as described above.c-Src Kinase Assay—After cell transfection, 10 μl of cell lysate from each sample was used for Src kinase assay as described previously (20Liu M. Qin Y. Liu J. Tanswell A.K. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7066-7071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine whether AFAP can directly activate c-Src, an in vitro reconstitution assay was performed (23Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 ng of purified and C-terminal Src kinase-inactivated c-Src (a gift from Dr. X. Huang, Cornell University) in Src kinase buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, and 10 μm ATP) was incubated with 2 μg of Src substrate peptide (24Cheng H.C. Nishio H. Hatase O. Ralph S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9248-9256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with purified recombinant cAFAP or AFAP71A (22Qian Y. Baisden J.M. Zot H.G. Van Winkle W.B. Flynn D.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 102-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) in a total 20-μl reaction volume at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer. After denaturing at 90 °C for 5 min, the samples were subjected to 20% SDS-PAGE to separate the substrate peptide. The gel was dried, autoradiographed, and quantified with a GS-690 densitometer (Bio-Rad).Immunofluorescent Staining and Microscopy—Immunofluorescent staining was conducted at room temperature. After different treatments, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then stained with indicated primary antibody for 60 min and the proper secondary antibody at 1:1,000 dilution (v/v) for 30 min in the dark. Slides were mounted with an anti-fading reagent, SlowFade, (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), followed by fluorescent microscopic examination (Nikon Canada, Toronto, Canada). The specificity of staining was determined by replacing the primary antibodies with nonspecific rabbit or mouse IgG (Sigma).For detecting the distribution of endogenous AFAP, A549 or C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured on glass cover slips and stained with anti-AFAP antibody (F1; 5 μg ml-1) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). For confirming the intracellular distribution of GFP-AFAP and its mutants, cells were cultured on glass coverslips and transfected with either pEGFP vector alone or pEGFP vectors containing fused cAFAP or its mutants (AFAP71A, AFAP77A, and AFAP5Y) for 48 h. Cells were co-stained with rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probe) at 1:1,000 dilution (v/v) for 30 min to image actin filaments.For evaluating the role of AFAP in stretch-induced c-Src activation, cells were cultured on collagen-coated BioFlex plates and transfected with either pEGFP vector alone or pEGFP vectors containing fused AFAP71A, AFAP77A, and AFAP5Y mutants for 48 h and then exposed to mechanical stretch or static control, as described above. The transfected cells were identified by GFP. The stretch-induced activation of Src was shown by staining with anti-Src phosphotyrosine 416 antibody followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alex 594 (Molecular Probe).Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. from at least three experiments and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student-Neuman-Keuls test with significance defined as p < 0.05.RESULTSMechanical Stretch-induced c-Src Activation and c-Src/AFAP Interaction—C3H10T1/2, C3H10T1/2-5H, NIH3T3, COS7, and A549 cells were cultured on collagen I-coated flexible plates and subjected to mechanical stretch (25% elongation, 60 cycles/min for 10 min) with a Flexcell Strain Unit. Autophosphorylation of Src Tyr-416 at the activation loop is a critical step leading to full activation of c-Src (25Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), which was increased in these cells by stretch regardless of the expression levels of total Src protein (Fig. 1a). Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase α has been reported as a transducer of mechanical force on integrin-cytoskeleton linkage (26von Wichert G. Jiang G. Kostic A. De Vos K. Sap J. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which can activate c-Src by reducing its phosphorylation on the Tyr-527 residue. In the present study, the phosphorylation of c-Src Tyr-527 was not decreased after cell stretch (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the c-Src activation is not secondary to the activation of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Similar results were obtained when these cells were cultured on fibronectin fragment-coated plates (data not shown). Therefore, c-Src activation appears to be a common phenomenon in different cell types responding to mechanical stimuli on different ECMs.Using COS7 cells as an example, we demonstrated that stretch for 10 min induced an increase of c-Src in a Tritoninsoluble cytoskeletal fraction (Fig. 1b). AFAP was first cloned from chicken. It contains an actin-binding motif and is localized to actin filaments, the cortical actin matrix, and along the leading edge of the cell (27Flynn D.C. Leu T.H. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7892-7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This distribution pattern suggests that AFAP is suitable for transmitting physical forces along the actin filaments and that it may mediate c-Src translocation to the cytoskeletal fraction through protein binding. Using C3H10T1/2-5H cells, we demonstrated that the binding of c-Src and AFAP, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, increased after mechanical stretch (Fig. 1c). Similar results were obtained with COS7 cells (data not shown).Crystallographic structure studies have revealed that the kinase activity of c-Src is maintained at a low basal level by two major intramolecular interactions; one is the binding of its SH3 domain to the linker between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain, and the other is the binding of its SH2 domain to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue 527 in its C-terminal tail (28Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 29Williams J.C. Weijland A. Gonfloni S. Thompson A. Courtneidge S.A. Superti-Furga G. Wierenga R.K. J.

Interruption of these interactions with high affinity ligands for either the Src SH2 or SH3 domain may activate the enzyme. AFAP contains Src SH3 and SH2 binding motifs (21Guappone A.C. Weimer T. Flynn D.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it may competitively bind to the c-Src SH2 and SH3 domains and induce an alteration of c-Src configuration, leading to c-Src activation. The interaction between AFAP and c-Src may be an important mechanism for mechanical stretch-induced c-Src activation (Fig. 1d).Cloning and Characterization of Human AFAP Protein—To determine the molecular structure of AFAP in mammalian cells, we cloned the hAFAP gene from human lung epithelial (A549) cells. The GenBank™ accession number of hAFAP is AF188700. The identity of peptide sequences between human and chicken AFAP is 87%. All of the functional motifs and domains described for chicken AFAP protein (31Qian Y. Baisden J.M. Westin E.H. Guappone A.C. Koay T.C. Flynn D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) are present in hAFAP in the same order (data not shown). The proline-rich Src SH3 binding motif, five putative tyrosines for Src SH2 binding, and an actin binding region are presented in Fig. 2a. The hAFAP gene is localized on human chromosome 4p16, as confirmed by PCR-based sequence-tagged sites serving as landmarks of genomic maps and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (data not shown). The steady state mRNA levels of hAFAP are differentially expressed in human tissues (Fig. 2b). The endogenous hAFAP protein is co-localized with actin filaments in A549 cells (Fig. 2c), as determined by double staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to decorate actin stress fibers and the antibody for AFAP followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to highlight hAFAP.Fig. 2Molecular cloning and characterization of human AFAP. a, schematic diagram for Src SH3, SH2, and actin binding motifs (Bmf.) in AFAP. b, differential expression of hAFAP in various human tissues. Manufacturer-made membranes cross-linked with equal amounts of human RNA (<10% variation) were probed for expression of hAFAP by Northern blotting. c, co-localization of hAFAP with actin filaments.

The merged image shows the alignment of hAFAP along with actin filaments (c). d, tyrosine phosphorylation of hAFAP and its binding with c-Src.

A549 cell lysates were incubated with the GST protein alone or the GST protein fused with the Src SH2, SH3, or SH3/SH2 domains, respectively. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-AFAP antibody (top). For protein loading control, after transferring proteins to the blotting membranes the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The endogenous hAFAP protein in A549 cells is tyrosine-phosphorylated and binds to c-Src as determined by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Fig. 2d). To determine the binding affinity of Src SH3 and SH2 domains to hAFAP, bacterial GST fusion proteins containing either or both Src SH3 and SH2 domains and captured on glutathione beads were incubated with A549 cell lysates, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti-AFAP antibody. hAFAP binds most efficiently to GST-Src SH2/SH3 beads, more so to GST-Src SH2 than to Src SH3 beads, and fails to bind to GST-only beads (Fig. 2e).Overexpression of AFAP Activates c-Src—To determine whether AFAP can activate c-Src, either hAFAP or cAFAP was co-expressed with c-Src in COS7 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins (Fig. 3a, top section) and autophosphorylation of c-Src at the Tyr-416 residue (Fig. 3a, second section from top, and b) were increased in the presence of both AFAP and c-Src. These effects are dependent on c-Src kinase activity, because the co-expression of c-Src-KD (a kinase inactive mutant of c-Src) with hAFAP or cAFAP did not have similar effects (Fig. 3a). The phosphorylation of c-Src Tyr527 was not reduced when hAFAP or cAFAP was co-expressed with c-Src (Fig. 3a, third section from top). The total Src protein levels in kinase-inactive c-Src-KD-transfected cells were higher (Fig. 3a, fourth section from top). It has been shown that Src activation leads to its degradation via an ubiquitin-dependent mechanism (32Hakak Y. Martin G.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Thus, in kinase inactive c-Src-KD-transfected cells the lack of kinase activity may stabilize c-Src. We further measured c-Src kinase activity with a specific Src substrate peptide, and this activity was significantly increased when hAFAP or cAFAP was co-expressed with c-Src (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3AFAP directly activates c-Src. a, co-expression of AFAP and c-Src increased total protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation. Constructs containing vector, hAFAP, cAFAP, or c-Src alone or hAFAP (or cAFAP) together with c-Src (or c-Src-KD, kinase inactive c-Src) were transfected into COS7 cells. The protein tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) status, the phosphorylation of the Tyr-416 (Src-pY416) or Tyr-527 (Src-pY527) of c-Src, and the expression of c-Src and AFAP protein levels were revealed by Western blotting. b, the Tyr-416 phosphorylation of c-Src was significantly increased when co-expressed with either hAFAP or cAFAP in COS7 cells. Data were quantified by densitometry from independent experiments. *, p < 0.05 versus other groups. c, the Src kinase activity was increased in hAFAP/c-Src or cAFAP/c-Src co-transfected cells. *, p < 0.05 versus c-Src alone. d, recombinant cAFAP directly activates c-Src in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. An in vitro reconstitution Src kinase assay was conducted with C-terminal Src kinase-treated inactive c-Src and increasing doses of recombinant cAFAP. The phosphorylation of the substrate peptide was measured by densitometry. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus control (no cAFAP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether AFAP-induced c-Src activation is a direct effect, various amounts of purified, recombinant cAFAP were incubated with an inactivated c-Src protein, a Src substrate peptide, together with [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylated substrate peptide was separated by 20% SDS-PAGE and exposed to an x-ray film (23Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recombinant cAFAP increased phosphorylation of the Src substrate in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3d).Effects of SH2 and SH3 Binding on AFAP-induced c-Src Activation—Binding to SH3 domains is mediated through proline-rich sequences (33Pawson T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 87-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Src-SH3-specific binding uses a sequence of seven amino acids of the consensus RPLPXXP (34Alexandropoulos K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). There are two stretches of proline-rich amino acids in the N terminus of AFAP. The first stretch (MPLPEIP) is a consensus Src-SH3 binding motif (Fig. 4a). Mutation of the last proline to alanine at position 71 (AFAP71A) significantly decreased total protein tyrosine phosphorylation and c-Src Tyr-416 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, b and c). In contrast, mutation from proline to alanine at position 77 (AFAP77A) in the second stretch of the proline-rich region had no such effects (Fig. 4, a-c). There are five putative Src SH2 binding tyrosines in AFAP (21Guappone A.C. Weimer T. Flynn D.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 22: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We co-expressed c-Src with a mutant (AFAP5Y), of which tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanines at positions 93, 94, 125, 451, and 453 (Fig. 4a). This mutant also decreased significantly protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of c-Src at Tyr-416 (Fig. 4, b and c). AFAP71A and AFAP5Y had no significant effect on phosphorylation of the Tyr-527 of c-Src (Fig. 4b). Similarly to our finding, Lerner and Smithgall also showed that human immunodeficiency virus-1 Nef protein-induced Hck (another Src family member) activation is not associated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of the conserved C-terminal tyrosine ("
https://openalex.org/W1977401216,"Lysine-specific murine histone H3 methyltransferase, G9a, was expressed and purified in a baculovirus expression system. The primary structure of the recombinant enzyme is identical to the native enzyme. Enzymatic activity was favorable at alkaline conditions (>pH 8) and low salt concentration and virtually unchanged between 25 and 42 °C. Purified G9a was used for substrate specificity and steady-state kinetic analysis with peptides representing un- or dimethylated lysine 9 histone H3 tails with native lysine 4 or with lysine 4 changed to alanine (K4AK9). In vitro methylation of the H3 tail peptide resulted in trimethylation of Lys-9 and the reaction is processive. The turnover number (kcat) for methylation was 88 and 32 h–1 on the wild type and K4AK9 histone H3 tail, respectively. The Michaelis constants for wild type and K4AK9 ((Kmpep)) were 0.9 and 1.0 μm and for S-adenosyl-l-methionine (KmAdoMet) were 1.8 and 0.6 μm, respectively. Comparable kinetic constants were obtained for recombinant histone H3. The conversion of K4AK9 di- to trimethyl-lysine was 7-fold slower than methyl group addition to unmethylated peptide. Preincubation studies showed that G9a-AdoMet and G9a-peptide complexes are catalytically active. Initial velocity data with peptide and S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) and product inhibition studies with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine were performed to assess the kinetic mechanism of the reaction. Double reciprocal plots and preincubation studies revealed S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine as a competitive inhibitor to AdoMet and mixed inhibitor to peptide. Trimethylated peptides acted as a competitive inhibitor to substrate peptide and mixed inhibitor to AdoMet suggesting a random mechanism in a Bi Bi reaction for recombinant G9a where either substrate can bind first to the enzyme, and either product can release first.

Histones participate in packaging of eukaryotic DNA. Amino-terminal tails of histones are exposed in packed chromatin and are thus amenable to various post-translational modifications. Histone H3 methylation in mammals is implicated in epigenetic gene regulation (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Other post-translational modifications namely, acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails are also documented (2Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar, 3Borun T.W. Pearson D. Paik W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4288-4298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Histone tail modifications are involved in transcriptional activation or repression of chromatin. Generally, acetylated histones mark transcriptionally active chromatin and hypoacetylated chromatin are silent. Furthermore, histone methylation can be a marker for transcriptionally active or inactive segments of the genome (4Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9) is a hallmark of silent chromatin and is globally distributed throughout the heterochromatic regions, such as centromeres and telomeres (5Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In the inactivated X chromosome of mammals (6Heard E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and transcriptionally silent genes in cancer cells frequent H3-K9 methylation is observed (7Kondo Y. Shen L. Yan P.S. Huang T.H. Issa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7398-7403Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Links between histone methylation and DNA methylation are emerging and have been demonstrated in Neurospora crassa and in plants. Experimental evidence have shown that histone methylation as a prerequisite for DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing in Neurospora (8Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis (9Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). There are also reports that DNA methylation may trigger H3-K9 methylation in Arabidopsis (10Soppe W.J. Jasencakova Z. Houben A. Kakutani T. Meister A. Huang M.S. Jacobsen S.E. Schubert I. Fransz P.F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6549-6559Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Tariq M. Saze H. Probst A.V. Lichota J.

A. 2003; 100: 8823-8827Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting interplay between histone and DNA methylation in maintaining the silent status of the chromatin. In mammals, H3-K9 directs DNA methylation to the pericentric heterochromatin (12Lehnertz B. Ueda Y. Derijck A.A. Braunschweig U. Perez-Burgos L. Kubicek S. Chen T. Li E. Jenuwein T. Peters A.H. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1192-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar) and to the tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a (13Bachman K.E. Park B.H. Rhee I. Rajagopalan H. Herman J.G.

Lysine methylation in mammals occurs at the ϵ amino group of the lysine residue. The lysine residues are mono-, di-, or trimethylated. Several histone H3-K9 specific methyltransferases such as Clr4 in yeast (14Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) have been identified. Both Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 play dominant roles in pericentric heterochromatin formation. Both the mouse (Suv39h1 and Suv39h2) and human (SUV39H1 and SUV39H2) genes encode proteins that bind to heterochromatin in association with mammalian HP1. Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 are histone K9-specific methyltransferases and their genetic disruption led to severe reduction in global H3-K9 trimethylation specifically at the pericentric heterochromatic region. Thus it is believed that Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 are responsible for trimethylation of histone H3-K9. The mechanism of Lys-9 methylation of the Drosophila Su(var)3–9 enzyme is relatively well studied. Although the methyltransferase domain is required for methyl transfer, mutation at the NH2 terminus of the enzyme disrupted its in vivo functions suggesting co-operation between the NH2 and COOH terminus for catalysis. This enzyme is a dimer in vitro and the NH2-terminal amino acid residues facilitate dimerization. Disruption of dimerization resulted in 10-fold less enzyme activity, suggesting interaction between the NH2 and COOH terminus for catalysis (19Eskeland R. Czermin B. Boeke J. Bonaldi T. Regula J.T. Imhof A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3740-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The other histone methyltransferase, G9a, is also shown to be involved in Lys-9 methylation of histone H3 on non-heterochromatic loci that are involved with transcriptionally active genes. Genetic disruption of G9a in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in significant disruption of histone H3-K9 dimethylation and to a lesser extent H3-K9 monomethylation (20Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1577-1589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Loss of G9a also resulted in reduction of H3-K9 methylation in the Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting center resulting in disruption of CpG methylation of the Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting center in mouse ES cells (21Xin Z. Tachibana M. Guggiari M. Heard E. Shinkai Y. Wagstaff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14996-15000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). G9a is considerably larger than Suv39h1 and Suv39h2. G9a has a stretch of polyglutamates at its NH2-terminal region along with characteristic ANK repeats suggesting protein-protein interaction. Like all other histone methyltransferases it has a COOH terminus that contains the SET domain (22Yeates T.O. Cell. 2002; 111: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Tachibana et al., (18Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) have described substrate specificity and sequence specificity of G9a but the reaction mechanism is yet to be elucidated. In this study an attempt was made to determine lysine 9 methylation events for substrate specificity and kinetic analysis of recombinant murine full-length G9a on a variety of synthetic peptides mimicking the NH2-terminal tail of histone H3 with an aim to learn about the mechanism of methyl transfer from the co-substrate AdoMet to the peptide. The kinetic parameters for methylation with those peptides and recombinant intact histone H3 substrate are reported herein for full-length G9a. We have also performed initial velocity and product inhibition studies to determine the reaction mechanism of the enzyme. Histone H3 Methyltransferase G9a Transfer Vector—G9a expression constructs were derived from pZKmG9aL, accession number AB077210 (gift of Prof. Yoichi Shinkai, Kyoto University). This plasmid contains the full-length murine G9a cDNA based on the previously published sequence (18Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). A PCR of the 3′ end of the cDNA was used to incorporate an EcoRI restriction endonuclease site in place of the stop codon of the cDNA and to provide the optimal amino acids for intein-tag cleavage (sense primer, 5′-CGGGGTACCTCCGGACTGGGGAGGAGCTGGG-C-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-GGCCTCGAGGAATTCGGTGTTGATG-GGGGGCAGGGAGCT-3′). The restriction sites are underlined. The addition of an EcoRI site resulted in addition of Glu and Phe to the last amino acid Thr of G9a. This PCR product of about 200 bp was digested with BspEI and EcoRI and ligated to LITMUS 28i (New England Biolabs) to give rise to pLitmus 28iG9a3′. The NsiI-BspEI fragment of G9a was excised from mG9aL and cloned into pLitmus 28iG9a3′ to give rise to pLitmus 28iG9aII. This construct contains the entire murine G9a cDNA except for the first ∼800 bp. The first 800 bp were PCR amplified (sense primer: 5′-GGCTCGCGAAACATGCGGGGTCTGCCG-AGAGGGAGG-3′ and antisense primer: 5′-CCTTCCCCAGATGCATG-TCATCAC-3′) and digested with NsiI and cloned into pLitmus 28iG9aII digested with SnaBI and NsiI resulting in a G9a full-length clone, pLitmus G9afl, without a stop codon at the 3′ end along with an NruI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the cDNA. The full-length cDNA without the stop codon was excised using NruI and EcoRI and ligated into pVIC1 digested with the same enzymes resulting in pVICG9a (Fig. 1). In pVICG9a the cDNA remained in-frame with the intein chitin-binding domain of transfer vector pVIC1. The ligated junctions in the final pVICG9a construct were verified by DNA sequencing. Insect Cell Culture, Viral Transfection, and Recombinant G9a Expression—Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) derived from the pupal ovarian tissue of the fall army worm, Spodoptera frugiperda, was used for co-transfection and expression of G9a as described previously (23Pradhan S.

Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 124-127Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Sf9 cells were maintained as a suspension culture in TNM-FH media (JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (v/v) and an antibiotic-antimycotic solution at a final concentration of 5 units of penicillin, 50 μg of streptomycin, and 0.125 μg of amphotericin B ml–1 at 27 °C on a Bellco stirring platform at 70 rpm. Co-transfection of a monolayer of Sf9 insect cells was carried out using BaculoGold DNA, a modified, linearized Autographa california nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BD Pharmingen), and the transfer vector pVICG9a. Four days after transfection, the supernatant was amplified 2 to 3 times to reach a viral titer above 2 × 108 ml–1 as estimated by the agarose overlay technique (24O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 124-127Google Scholar). Recombinant viruses were used for test expression by infecting 1.5 × 106 Sf9 cells at different multiplicity of infections in a 60-mm Petri dish. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cell extracts were checked for histone H3 methyltransferase activity and for fusion protein expression by Western blot analysis using anti-CBD monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs). For routine protein expression, Sf9 cells were grown in spinner culture flasks. Sf9 cells at a density of 1.2 × 106 ml–1 were infected at a multiplicity of infection between 6 and 10. The cells were kept at 27 °C at 60 rpm and harvested 48-h post-infection after a final wash with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Recombinant G9a Purification—For protein purification, infected cells (5.6 × 108) were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, protease inhibitor mixture containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma), 0.2% (v/v) per ml of cell extract, 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 500 mm NaCl). The cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 30 s using a model W-225R (Heatsystem, Ultrasonics) sonicator in pulsed mode at 50% duty cycle. The extract was incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional shaking and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 30 min. If the supernatant remained cloudy, then one more centrifugation step was included. This supernatant was applied to a chitin bead column (New England Biolabs) equilibrated with buffer H at 0.4 ml/min. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing with 30 column volumes of buffer H. On column cleavage, the target protein was initiated by passing 2 column volumes of buffer H supplemented with 50 mm dithiothreitol. The column was closed and the target protein was cleaved from the intein-tag by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Recombinant G9a was eluted with buffer H containing 4 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed against buffer H supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, 50% glycerol (v/v), and 4 mm dithiothreitol. The purified protein was stored at –20 °C. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE (4–20% Tris glycine-SDS gradient gel) and quantitated using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. Histone Methyltransferase Assay—Methyltransferase assays were carried out at 25 °C for 3 min in duplicate with a total volume of 25 μl of reaction mixture. A typical reaction contained S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. (specific activity 15 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), substrate peptide, and enzyme in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 7 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For kinetic analysis, the Lys-9 concentration was calculated from the molecular weight of the substrate peptide. For double-reciprocal plots, the concentrations of peptide and AdoMet were varied. The methyltransferase reactions were stopped by transferring the reaction tubes to an ethanol-dry ice bath or spotted directly on P81 paper circles (Whatman). From each reaction mixture, 10 μl was spotted in duplicate on P81 circles. These circles were washed sequentially three times (5 ml/circle) with cold 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and dried. 2.5 ml of SafeScint scintillation mixture (American Bioanalytical) was added to each and tritium incorporation was measured. All methylation values were corrected for nonspecific binding of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine to the processed filter. Background calculations were measured in the absence of enzyme at zero time. To calculate counting efficiency, internal tritium standards were used. The efficiency of [3H]DNA measurement was ∼55% and all calculations were corrected accordingly. Data obtained were plotted by regression analysis using the GraphPad PRISM 4b program (GraphPad Software Inc.). To determine the sequence specificity of G9a methylation, 740 nm G9afl enzyme with 192 μm synthetic peptide substrate (K4AK9) and 1.0 mm AdoMet was added in a total reaction volume of 300 μl. At 0, 15-, 30-, 60-, and 120-min intervals, 50 μl of the samples were withdrawn and 5 μl of trifluoroacetic acid was added to stop the reaction. For completion of methylation the last sample was incubated overnight. All reactions were performed at 25 °C. Analysis of Peptide Methylation by Mass Spectroscopy and Peptide Sequencing—The K4AK9 peptide, CARTAQTARKSTGGY(K-ϵ-biotin), or K4AK9-trimethylated peptide were prepared in-house using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The peptides were spotted on a 1 mm × 4-mm piece of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Problott, Applied Biosystems Inc.) and sequenced using Procise 494 (Applied Biosystems Inc.) according to the procedure of Matsudaira (25Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with modifications as described previously (26Waite-Rees P.A. Keating C.J. Moran L.S. Slatko B.E. Hornstra L.J. Benner J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 173: 5207-5219Crossref Google Scholar). The modified H3-(K4AK9-trimethyl) peptide was also sequenced in the same way. The modification of the G9 peptide was also monitored by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The samples were prepared by mixing 1 μl of sample and 3, 5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix dissolved in 50:50 acetonitrile: water contaning 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and air drying. The spectra were obtained on an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE MALDI-TOF MS instrument. Peptide Substrates for Methylation Analysis—All peptides were synthesized at New England Biolabs, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and intactness and purity were checked with mass spectroscopy. Peptides used in this study are listed in Table I. For kinetic analysis all peptides were dissolved in Milli-Q sterilized water and kept frozen at –20 °C before use.Table ISubstrates and methylated peptides used in kinetic analysis of recombinant G9aPeptide sequencePeptide nameCARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRK-BTWt-H3ARTKQTARKSTGGKAPRKQLWt-H3-nonbiotinCARTKQTAR(2me-K)STGGKAPRK-BTWt-H3-(K9-dime)CARTAQTARKSTGGY-BTK4AK9CARTKQTARASTGGY-BTK4K9ACARTAQTARASTGGY-BTK4A/K9ACARTAQTAR(2-meK)STGGY-BTK4AK9-dimeCARTAQTAR(3-meK)STGGY-BTK4AK9-trime Open table in a new tab Processivity Studies—A master mixture (600 μl) containing 1.1 μm biotin-conjugated histone H3 tail peptide (Wt-H3), 25 nm G9a, 5 μm AdoMet was incubated at room temperature for 3 min. After 3 min, 300 μl was removed and mixed with 22 μm Wt-H3-nonbiotin tail peptide (no biotin). Aliquots of 25 μl were withdrawn at 3-min intervals up to 15 min, and the reaction was stopped with 1 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. To the reaction mixture 50 μlof1× phosphate-buffered saline and 25 μlof streptavidin magnetic beads (0.1 mg) were added. The captured peptides were washed with 3× 1 ml of cold 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate, air dried, and finally dissolved in 100 μlof0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and transferred to scintillation vials. 3 ml of SafeScint scintillation mixture was added and mixed before radioactive measurement. Preincubation Studies—Preincubation experiments were carried out by incubating 25 nm G9a with either 5 μmS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine or 4.4 μm K4AK9 for 10 min. The reaction was started by adding the missing reactant, i.e. peptide (final concentration 4.4 μm) in the first reaction mixture and S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine (5 μm) to the second one. Aliquots of 10 μl were withdrawn at each minute interval up to 12 min, and spotted directly on P81 and processed as described before. Enzyme Assay for Initial Velocities in the Absence or Presence of Products and Data Analysis—All initial velocity studies were performed under identical conditions as described for the histone H3 methyltransferase assay. For initial velocity studies with wild type, K4AK9, and K4AK9-dime, the peptides (0.14–4.4 μm) were incubated with 25 nm recombinant G9a and 5 μmS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-3H]methionine. Product formation was kept below 5% of the substrate. The product formed was measured in counts/min. The nanomolar product formed ([3H]CH3 group transfer) (N) present at the end of the reaction was calculated as n = (Y – B)/E × F, where Y is counts/min for each experiment, B is counts/min blank, E is efficiency (0.55), F is counts/min/nm free AdoMet. Product formed per min was obtained as N/T, where T is the time of reaction. The nm/min was fitted into a one-site binding (hyperbola) equation as follows.Hyperbola, v=Vmax[S]/Km+[S](Eq. 1) This describes binding of a substrate/ligand to an enzyme that follows the law of mass action. Vmax is the maximal velocity and Km is the concentration of substrate to reach half-maximal velocity. All data points were analyzed by nonlinear regression. From Vmax, turnover number (kcat) was calculated as: kcat = Vmax/[Et], where [Et] defines total enzyme concentration. For double reciprocal plots, the initial velocity 1/v was obtained as Et × T/N. Data points were collected in duplicate, plotted on Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots, and fitted to weighted linear regression. The families of linear regression plots give a preliminary clue toward the nature of the reaction mechanism. These plots essentially gave two independent variables, namely the reciprocals of the apparent Vmax (Vmax(app)), given by the y axis intercepts and the ratio of the Michaelis constant (Km) (plus the dissociation constant) for the variable substrate to Vmax(app), given by the slope. By replotting the intercepts and slopes obtained, one would also determine the true Vmax and Km for a substrate. The equations used for fitting the data points and to obtain the kinetic constants, Vmax, Kmpep, KmH3, KmAdoMet, are reported elsewhere (27Segal I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). These figures represent estimated values. Initial velocity studies in the presence of products were performed to distinguish the reaction mechanism. G9a has two products at the end of the reaction, one AdoHcy (S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine) and trimethylated histone H3 or peptides mimicking the histone H3 tail. AdoHcy (Sigma) was dissolved in 10 n HCl and diluted with Milli-Q water to 100 μm. Methylated peptide was dissolved in Milli-Q water. Assays were performed as described earlier with the exception of addition of a fixed amount of end products. In the experiments with AdoHcy the concentration range of the reactants was 0.14–4.4 μm K4AK9, 0.3–3.0 μm AdoMet, and 0–10 μm AdoHcy. For the assay with trimethylated peptide, the concentration of the reactants were in the range of 0.14–4.4 μm for K4AK9, 0–2.7 μm for K4AK9-trime, and 0.3–3 μm for AdoMet. The sequence of the trimethylated peptide was: CARTKQTAR(tri-meK)STGGKAPRKQLATKAAR(tri-meK)SAPA. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Histone H3 Methyltransferase G9a—Co-transfection of pVICG9a transfer vector (Fig. 1A) with linear A. california nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, BD Pharmingen) resulted in homologous recombination of the polyhedrin promoter and the downstream G9a cDNA. Only the recombinant viruses were viable and were amplified further to produce recombinant enzyme in Sf9 cells. A multiplicity of infection of 8 for 48 h, incubation at 27 °C, was found to be optimal for protein expression. The recombinant G9a was soluble and was purified to >90% purity (Fig. 1B). The apparent molecular mass of the purified recombinant G9a was about 165 kDa as reported earlier (18Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The purified G9a protein was sequenced and had an intact amino terminus (data not shown). A secondary band appeared in this purification that is the host cellular chitinase because of its affinity to the chitin matrix. The dialyzed proteins were stored at –20 °C for several weeks with no apparent loss of activity. We also examined if this residual chitinase presence can have any affect on the methylation reaction in the absence of histone substrates by incubating the enzyme preparation with radioactive AdoMet. A time course of reaction revealed no detectable amount of methylation in the purified fraction (data not shown). Recombinant proteins were assayed for substrate specificity, optimal pH, and temperature. Methyl transfer was highly dependent on the reaction conditions. At pH 7 the enzyme displayed poor catalytic activity. The velocity of the reaction increased gradually from pH 7.4 to 9 and dropped slowly after that (Fig. 2A). At pH 11 the enzyme activity dropped drastically (data not shown). The enzyme activity was significantly reduced in the presence of salt (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, the recombinant enzyme was capable of methyl group transfer at 0 °C and had no apparent increase in methylation between 25 and 42 °C (Fig. 2C). Incubation of recombinant G9a with wild type histone H3 tail peptide or peptide with K4A (K4AK9) resulted in methylation. However, mutation in K9A abolished methyl group incorporation, suggesting that the Lys-9 residue is the target amino acid for catalysis (Fig. 2D). Lysine Trimethylation Is Catalyzed by Recombinant G9a— The ϵ amino group of lysine residues are prone to methylation, with a total possible addition of three methyl groups. Because recombinant G9a histone methyltransferase was able to methylate the histone H3 tail peptide, we synthesized the first 14 amino acids of the NH2-terminal tail region with a K4A. Therefore, this peptide has only one lysine at position Lys-9 that could possibly be methylated. Furthermore, a chemically synthesized K4A/K9A (Fig. 2D) or K4AK9-trimethylated peptide incubated with recombinant G9a did not result in any methyl group transfer (data not shown) confirming that the G9a substrate specificity in the peptide is the Lys-9 residue. To determine the sequence of methylation events with regard to the number of methyl groups transferred, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was used on in vitro methylated synthetic peptides at different time"

Finally, our studies show that Zwint-1 is a new component of the mitotic check-point, as cells lacking Zwint-1 fail to arrest in mitosis when exposed to microtubule inhibitors, yielding interphase cells with multinuclei.

As ZW10 and Zwint-1 are absent from yeast, we reasoned that metazoans evolved an elaborate spindle checkpoint machinery to ensure faithful chromosome segregation in mitosis. Chromosome movements during mitosis are governed by the interaction of spindle microtubules with a specialized chromosome domain located within the centromere. This specialized region, called the kinetochore (1Brinkley B.R. Stubblefield E. Chromosoma. 1966; 19: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Roos U-P. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 54: 363-385Google Scholar), is the site for spindle microtubule-centromere association. In addition to providing a physical link between chromosomes and spindle microtubules, the kinetochore has an active function in chromosomal segregation through microtubule motors and spindle checkpoint sensors located at or near it (3Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2245-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 4Rieder C.L. Alexander S.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 5Yao X. Abrieu A.

Eukaryotic organisms require extraordinary fidelity in chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis as aberrant chromosome segregation can be catastrophic to an organism or its progeny. One of the evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complexes essential for the fidelity of chromosome segregation contains several proteins, including ZW10 1The abbreviations used are: ZW10, Zeste White 10; Zwint1, ZW10 interacting protein-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RNAi, RNA interference; ACA, anti-centromere antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: ZW10, Zeste White 10; Zwint1, ZW10 interacting protein-1; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RNAi, RNA interference; ACA, anti-centromere antibody.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1289-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Drosophila ZW10 or ROD genes cause similar defects, most noticeably in lagging chromatids that remain at the metaphase plate late in anaphase, leading to high levels of aneuploidy among daughter cells. ZW10 and ROD proteins display remarkable dynamics in their intracellular location during cell division (7Williams B.C. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 785-798PubMed Google Scholar, 9Starr D.A.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3103-3114PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins accumulate strongly at the outer kinetochore plates during prometaphase. At metaphase, ZW10 and ROD depart from the kinetochores and relocate onto spindle microtubules. During anaphase, the proteins are no longer found on kinetochore microtubules and instead localize exclusively to the kinetochores of the separating chromosomes. Besides binding to ROD, ZW10 is responsible for localization of cytoplasmic dynein to kinetochores (10Scaerou F. Starr D.A. Piano F. Papoulas O. Karess R.E. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3103-3114PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wojcik E. Basto R. Serr M. Scaerou F. Karess R. Hays T. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 944-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). HZwint-1 (Human ZW10 interacting protein-1, referred to as Zwint-1 hereafter) was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins interacting with ZW10. Zwint-1 targets to the kinetochore prior to ZW10 in prophase HeLa cells and remains at the kinetochore until late in anaphase. The spatial-temporal distribution of Zwint-1 relative to ZW10 raises the possibility that Zwint-1 may be responsible for ZW10 localization to the kinetochore. However, the inter-relationship between Zwint-1 and ZW10 is not known, nor whether Zwint-1 is essential and sufficient for ZW10 localization. To explore the nature of the ZW10-Zwint-1 interaction at the kinetochore and their respective functions in spindle checkpoint signaling, we used a yeast two-hybrid assay to pinpoint an interface for such an interaction. Our biochemical studies confirmed that Zwint-1 interacts with the N-terminal 80 amino acids of ZW10. In addition, expression of the mutant ZW10 protein in HeLa cells indicated that this Zwint-1 interacting domain is sufficient for ZW10 distribution to the kinetochore. Suppression of Zwint-1 protein synthesis by small interfering RNA liberated kinetochore localization of ZW10. Most significantly, depletion of Zwint-1 abrogates the mitotic checkpoint induced by microtubule disruptors. In addition, Zwint-1 is required for stable kinetochore localization of CENP-F and dynamitin. Given the inter-relationship of ZW10-Zwint-1 established here, we propose that Zwint-1 links ZW10/ROD/dynein-mediated checkpoint signaling to chromosome segregation dynamics. Cell Cultures—HeLa and 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultivated as subconfluent monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin plus 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C with 10% CO2. CDNA Construction—To generate GFP-tagged full-length ZW10 and deletion mutants, ZW10 cDNA was digested with BamHI and XhoI and then cloned into pEGFP C3 vector (Clontech). The bacterial expression constructs of ZW10 were cloned into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), whereas Zwint-1 cDNA was cloned into pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) with BamHI and EcoRI. FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 cDNA was cloned by inserting the PCR product into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) with EcoRI and XhoI digestion. Recombinant Protein Production—Purification of recombinant proteins was carried out as described previously (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of LB media was inoculated with bacteria transformed with GST-ZW10 and GST-Zwint-1, respectively. The protein expression was initiated by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacteria were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing proteinase inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin; 5 μg/ml) followed by sonication and clarification as described previously (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein in bacteria in the soluble fraction was purified by using glutathione-agarose chromatography (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Antibody Production—GST-tagged Zwint-1 and ZW10 proteins were immunized into three Balb/c mice, respectively, according to standard protocol. These mice were boosted every 3 weeks until antibody titer reached 1:1500 as judged by Western blotting. The splenocytes from immunized mice were fused with FO myeloma cells (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA) according to standard protocol. Mono-specific antibodies against ZW10 and Zwint-1 were selected based on Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Pull-down Assay—GST fusion protein-bound Sepharose beads were used as an affinity matrix to isolate proteins interacting with ZW10 by using the soluble fraction from mitotic cell lysates as described previously (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Briefly, the GST-ZW10 (full-length and its deletion mutants) fusion protein-bound Sepharose beads were incubated with 293T cell lysate containing FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 for 4 h at 4 °C. After the incubation, the beads were extensively washed with PBS and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by fractionation of bound proteins on a 6–12% gradient gel. Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting using FLAG antibody (Sigma). For the immunoprecipitation assay, GFP-ZW10 and FLAG-Zwint-1 co-expressing 293T cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) on ice followed by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). GFP-ZW10 protein and its accessory proteins were harvested with GFP rabbit IgG-coupled protein-A/G beads. These beads were then washed and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with a monoclonal GFP antibody and FLAG antibody, respectively. siRNA Treatment and Assay for Knock-down Efficiency—The siRNA sequence used for silencing of Zwint-1 corresponds to the coding region 163–183 (relative to the start codon). As a control, either a duplex targeting cyclophilin or scramble sequence was used (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The 21-mer oligonucleotide RNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Boulder, CO). In the trial experiments, different concentrations of siRNA oligonucleotides were used for different time intervals of treatment as detailed previously, whereas transfection efficiency was judged based on the uptake of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated oligonucleotides (14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were synchronized and transfected with 21-mer siRNA oligonucleotides or control scramble oligonucleotide, whereas the efficiency of this siRNA-mediated protein suppression was judged by Western blotting analysis. Immunofluorescent Staining Analysis—For immunofluorescence, cells were seeded onto sterile, acid-treated 18-mm coverslips in 6-well plates (Corning Glass). Double thymidine-blocked and -released HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg/ml Lipofectamine 2000 pre-mixed with various siRNA oligonucleotides as described above. In general, 36 h after transfection with siRNA or scrambled (control) oligonucleotides, HeLa cells were rinsed for 1 min with PHEM buffer (100 mm PIPES, 20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 4 m glycerol) and were permeabilized for 1 min with PHEM plus 0.2% Triton X-100 as described previously (5Yao X. Abrieu A. Zheng Y. Sullivan K.F. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 15Lou Y. Yao J. Zereshki A. Dou Z. Ahmed K. Wang H. Hu J. Wang Y. Yao X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20049-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Extracted cells were then fixed in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde plus 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PHEM for 20 min and rinsed three times in PBS. Cells on the coverslips were blocked with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS (TPBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). These fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with various primary antibodies in a humidified chamber for 1 h followed by three washes to remove unbound antibody. FLAG epitope was visualized using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, whereas binding of anti-centromere antibody was visualized using Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-human IgG + IgM. DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). Slides were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert-200 fluorescence microscope, and images were collected and analyzed with Image-5 (Carl Zeiss, Germany). In some experiments, aliquots of oligonucleotide-treated HeLa cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml nocodazole for a period of 18 h to determine whether elimination of Zwint-1 abrogates the mitotic spindle check-point. These cells were then fixed and stained with DAPI for scoring the cell fate profiling under microscope. Western Blot—Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 6–16% gradient gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were probed by appropriate primary and 125I-protein A. Immunoreactive signals were visualized by autoradiography on Kodak BioMAX MS film for 6–8 h at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. In some cases, the blots were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using ECL (Pierce), whereas the band intensity was then scanned using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). ZW10 Binds to Zwint1 via Its N-terminal Region—Our early studies revealed that human Zwint-1, a 43-kDa ZW10-binding protein, interacts with ZW10 and co-localizes to the kinetochore of mitotic HeLa cells (12Starr D.A. Saffery R. Li Z. Simpson A.E. Choo K.H. Yen T.J. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1939-1950PubMed Google Scholar). To map the precise Zwint1 binding interface on ZW10, we employed a GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system in which a series of ZW10 deletion mutant cDNAs were co-transformed with Zwint1 cDNA into yeast cells using β-galactosidase activity as a measure for protein-protein interaction. As summarized in Fig. 1A, the most N-terminal 80 amino acids are sufficient for Zwint-1 interaction. To validate the genetic interaction between ZW10 and Zwint-1 assessed in yeast and to test whether the N-terminal ZW10 is sufficient to bind Zwint1 in vitro, we carried out a pull-down assay in which FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 fusion protein from 293 cell lysates binds to bacterially recombinant GST fusion protein of ZW10 and its fragments as judged by FLAG antibody Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Western blot with GST antibody validated the level of GST fusion proteins used as affinity matrix. No FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 was absorbed by the GST protein, suggesting that the interaction between Zwint-1 and N-terminal ZW10 is specific and independent of the GST tag. To test whether the N-terminal ZW10 is sufficient to bind Zwint-1 in vivo and to confirm the binding interface, we transfected FLAG-Zwint-1 cDNA into 293T cells along with various GFP-ZW10 deletion constructs, and we isolated ZW10 proteins with GFP rabbit IgG-coupled protein A-Sepharose beads. Western blot using monoclonal FLAG antibody, shown in Fig. 1C, validates that Zwint-11 binds to ZW10 via its N terminus (lanes 6 and 7). Further immunoprecipitation verified that the N-terminal 80 amino acids of ZW10 mediate ZW10-Zwint-1 interaction (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that the N terminus of ZW10 is sufficient for Zwint-1 binding. Zwint-1 Binding Domain Is Required for Localization of ZW10 to Kinetochore—To account for the molecular basis underlying the association of ZW10 with the kinetochore, we sought to identify its kinetochore-targeting domain. Different segments of GFP-ZW10 were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 into HeLa cells and scored for the kinetochore localization by fluorescence microscopy. Western blot of transfected lysates showed that all the constructs, including full-length GFP-ZW10, expressed proteins of the predicted size (e.g. Fig. 1C). To verify that the GFP tag would not interfere with localization of ZW10, the full-length ZW10 was first tested. GFP-ZW10 was found to localize near the nuclear membrane in prophase cells (Fig. 2A), whereas FLAG-tagged Zwint-1 is located at the pre-kinetochore of newly condensed chromosomes exemplified by typical double-dot staining (c, arrowheads). This non-overlapping distribution profile becomes clear when these two images are merged with DNA staining (Fig. 2A, d, arrowheads). However, in prometaphase cells, it was readily apparent that GFP-ZW10 is located at the kinetochores (Fig. 2A, e, arrow-heads), which is co-localized with that of Zwint-1 staining. Thus, we concluded that Zwint-1 localizes to the kinetochore prior to ZW10, which is consistent with our early studies (12Starr D.A. Saffery R. Li Z. Simpson A.E. Choo K.H. Yen T.J. Goldberg M.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1939-1950PubMed Google Scholar). Their distinct temporal orders of assembly to the kinetochore propelled us to examine the region(s) on ZW10 that mediate the ZW10-kinetochore association. Among the several fragments of ZW10 that were examined, all N-terminal fragments were clearly localized to kinetochores (e.g. Fig. 2B, a, arrowheads). In contrast, the C-terminal ZW10, for example amino acids 470–779, was found not to localize to kinetochores. Thus, the kinetochore-binding domain of ZW10 resides within the N-terminal 80 amino acids, which is sufficient for ZW10 localization to the kinetochore. Zwint-1 Is Necessary and Sufficient for Localization of ZW10 to the Kinetochores—Because immunoprecipitation experiments did not reveal an interaction between N-ZW10 and endogenous ZW10, the localization of ZW10 N-terminal fragments at kinetochores was not because of its interaction with endogenous ZW10 but likely via its association with Zwint-1 given their interaction and the spatio-temporal order of their targeting to the kinetochore. Therefore, we tested whether Zwint-1 might specify the kinetochore localization of ZW10. To this end, we introduced RNA interference (RNAi) oligonucleotides to Zwint-1 by transfection into HeLa cells. To determine the efficient timing for knocking down the Zwint-1 protein level by using the RNAi, we transfected HeLa cells with 100 nm oligonucleotides, and we collected cells at different intervals after the transfection. As shown in Fig. 3A, Western blotting with a Zwint-1 antibody revealed that the RNAi oligonucleotide caused remarkable suppression of the Zwint-1 protein level at 48 h, whereas control cells treated with irrelevant oligonucleotides (e.g. cyclophilin) express normal Zwint-1 levels (not shown). This suppression is relatively specific as it did not alter the levels of other proteins such as CENP-F, ZW10, Dynamitin, and β-tubulin. Quantitative immunoblotting of Zwint-1 revealed that 100 nm Zwint-1 RNAi oligonucleotide caused a remarkable 7.3-fold suppression of Zwint-1 protein. Because Zwint-1 synthesis in the ∼25% of untransfected cells with little or no oligonucleotide was unlikely to be markedly diminished, the observed ∼7.3-fold inhibition at 100 nm must represent almost complete inhibition of Zwint-1 in 76 ± 3% of successfully transfected cells. Similarly, siRNA-mediated suppression of ZW10 caused a time-dependent reduction of ZW10 protein levels. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that 100 nm RNAi oligonucleotide effected a remarkable 7.1-fold suppression of ZW10 protein, which represent almost complete inhibition of ZW10 in 75 ± 3% of successfully transfected cells. We next examined whether elimination of the Zwint-1 protein altered localization of ZW10 to the kinetochore, so we treated HeLa cells with siRNA oligonucleotide. Forty eight hours after the transfection, cells were collected and stained for ZW10, Zwint-1, and DNA, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3C (a and c), ZW10 and Zwint-1 staining marks characteristic centromere localization, respectively. Most interestingly, ZW10 kinetochore localization was liberated from the kinetochore of the cells with depleted Zwint-1 (Fig. 3C, e and g), suggesting that Zwint-1 is required for targeting of ZW10 to the kinetochore. To test whether elimination of Zwint-1 has a global effect on kinetochore assembly, we then tested for the localization of ACA to the kinetochore. As shown in Fig. 3C, k, ACA labeling displays a typical kinetochore localization in Zwint-1-depleted cells, suggesting that ZW10 localization to kinetochore is likely dependent on Zwint-1. Because Zwint-1 binds to ZW10, we then tested whether ZW10 is also required for the localization of Zwint-1 to the kinetochore. As shown in Fig. 3C, o, Zwint-1 labeling displays a typical kinetochore localization in ZW10-depleted cells, indicating that Zwint-1 localization to kinetochore is independent of ZW10. Thus, we conclude that Zwint-1 specifies the kinetochore localization of ZW10. Zwint-1 Is Required for Kinetochore Localization of CENP-F and Dynamitin—Next, we examined the effect of Zwint-1-depletion on the distribution of other kinetochore proteins such as CENP-E and CENP-F. In scramble-transfected control cultures, ZW10, CENP-E, and CENP-F all co-localize to the kinetochores of prometaphase cells (Fig. 4, b–d, arrowheads). In cells in which Zwint-1 had been depleted, the levels of CENP-E present at kinetochores appeared largely unaltered (Fig. 4, g and o). In contrast, the levels of kinetochore-bound ZW10 and CENP-F appeared diminished (Fig. 4, f and h). Quantification of normalized pixel intensities shows that, when Zwint-1 was reduced to less than ∼5% of its control value, kinetochore-bound ZW10 and CENP-F proteins were nearly undetectable, whereas kinetochore-bound CENP-E level was virtually unchanged. Elimination of ZW10 did not significantly diminish the localization of CENP-F to the kinetochore (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that localization of CENP-F to kinetochore is dependent on Zwint-1. We have showed previously that ZW10 links cytoplasmic dynein to the kinetochore by its association with dynamitin (11Wojcik E. Basto R. Serr M. Scaerou F. Karess R. Hays T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To verify if Zwint-1 is required for ZW10-dependent assembly of dynamitin to the kinetochore, we then examined the effect of Zwint-1 suppression on the kinetochore localization of dynamitin. In scramble oligonucleotide-transfected control cells, Zwint-1, CENP-E, and dynamitin all co-localized to prometaphase kinetochores (Fig. 4, j–l, arrowheads). However, kinetochore localization of dynamitin diminished (Fig. 4n) as siRNA treatment suppressed the Zwint-1 protein expression (Fig. 4p). Thus, our studies indicate that Zwint-1 specifies the kinetochore localization of CENP-F and ZW10 that is essential for dynamitin localization to the kinetochore. Zwint-1 Is a Checkpoint Component Essential for Faithful Chromosome Segregation—To explore whether depletion of Zwint-1 causes any cell cycle-related defects in HeLa cells, we collected control oligonucleotide-treated and siRNA-treated cells, stained with DAPI, ACA, and ZW10. Control anaphase cells treated with scramble oligonucleotide exhibited a total separation of two sets of sister chromatids (Fig. 5A, b). However, cells treated with Zwint-1 siRNA display a typical chromosome bridge phenotype, in which the majority of sister chromatids is separated with one or more sister chromatids entangled (Fig. 5A, f, arrow), a phenotype similar to that seen in Drosophila cells lacking either ROD or ZW10 (16Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Basto R. Gomes R. Karess R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Careful examination of these Zwint-1-suppressed cells also revealed that sister chromatids failed to segregate into two opposite poles (Fig. 5A, h, arrowheads). The failure in separating equal sister chromatids prior to entry into anaphase resulted in unequal distribution of chromatids, which leads to aneuploidy. We surveyed ∼150 mitotic cells from three different experiments, in which both sets of sister chromatids were in the same focal plane, from Zwint-1 siRNA oligonucleotide-treated and control oligonucleotide-treated cells. We counted the number of cells displaying typical chromosome bridge phenotype and expressed it as the percentage of the total cell population that is in mitosis. As shown in Fig. 5B, a summary from three different experiments shows that the depletion of Zwint-1 resulted in significant increases in cells bearing lagging chromosomes (39.7 ± 4.9%; p < 0.01 compared with that of control) and chromosome bridges (43.1 ± 5.4%; p < 0.01 compared with that of control). A survey of ZW10-depleted cells from three different experiments indicated that loss of ZW10 generated a large fraction of aberrant cells with chromosome bridges (41.3 ± 5.7%), which is similar to that seen Zwint-1-depleted cells. These data demonstrate that loss of Zwint-1 is responsible for defects of chromosome segregation associated with premature entry into anaphase.Fig. 5Zwint-1 is essential for faithful chromosome segregation. A, depletion of Zwint-1-impaired spindle checkpoint by promoting a premature anaphase (a–i). HeLa cells were transfected with Zwint-1 siRNA oligonucleotide and control oligonucleotide for 48 h followed by fixation and indirect immunofluorescence staining. This set of optical images was collected from an anaphase HeLa cell triply stained for human ACA (red), DAPI (DNA, blue), ZW10 (ZW10, green), and their merged images. As shown in f, Zwint-1-depleted cell entered in anaphase with a chromatin bridge (f and h, arrow). Most interestingly, ACA staining (g, arrowhead) verifies that this pair of chromatids failed to separate as the cell entered anaphase, leading to occurrence of aneuploidy. Bars, 10 μm. B, depletion of Zwint-1 and ZW10 by siRNA effected mitotic defects in chromosome segregation. HeLa cells were transfected with Zwint-1 siRNA oligonucleotide and control oligonucleotide for 48 h followed by fixation and DNA staining. Cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscopy to sort out the phenotypes. We categorized the phenotypes as normal mitosis (prometaphase/metaphase, anaphase/telophase) and those that carried lagging chromosomes and that prematurely exited from mitosis with unseparated sister chromatids and chromatin bridges. They were quantified and expressed as percentage of total mitotic cells. An average of 150 cells from three separate experiments was counted for HeLa cells treated with Zwint-1 and ZW10 siRNA oligonucleotides, respectively. The scramble oligonucleotides were transfected as control. Error bars represent S.E.; n = 3 preparations. *, p < 0.01 compared with the controls. C, Zwint-1 is required for mitotic spindle checkpoint (a–h). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides for Zwint-1 at the time of release from the double thymidine block. The transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole at 8 h after the transfection. These nocodazole-treated transfected cells were harvested 24 h later followed by fixation and indirect immunofluorescence staining. This montage represents optical images collected from an anaphase HeLa cell triply stained for human ACA (red), DAPI (DNA, blue), ZW10 (ZW10, green), and their merged images. As shown in f, Zwint-1-depleted cells escaped from the mitotic checkpoint activated by nocodazole treatment and formed multinuclei (b and d). ACA staining (g, arrowhead) verifies that pre-kinetochore structure remains unchanged. Another example of cells displayed lagging chromosome in nocodazole-treated Zwint-1 depleted cells (arrows, f). Representative images from a control cell transfected with scrambled oligonucleotide were shown (a′–d′). Bars, 10 μm. D, elimination of Zwint-1 promotes mitotic exit without nuclei dividing and separation. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides for Zwint-1 and ZW10 at the time of release from the double thymidine block. The transfected cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole at 8 h after the transfection. These nocodazole-treated transfected cells were harvested 24 h later followed by fixation and indirect immunofluorescence staining. Cells were then examined under a microscope to determine their fates. They were quantified and expressed as percentage of transfected cells. An average of 150 cells from three separate experiments were counted for HeLa cells treated with Zwint-1 and ZW10 siRNA oligonucleotides, respectively. The scramble oligonucleotides were transfected as control. Error bars represent S.E.; n = 3 preparations. *, p < 0.01 compared with the controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chromatin bridges and lagging chromosomes are frequently seen in cells that lack the mitotic checkpoint because these cells divide in the presence of unaligned chromosomes (e.g. Ref. 14Echeverri C.J. Paschal B.M. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 617-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed whether cells depleted of Zwint-1 could be arrested in mitosis in the presence of microtubule inhibitors such as nocodazole. 16 h after release from the G1/S boundary, HeLa cells transfected with scramble oligonucleotide were arrested in mitosis after nocodazole treatment (Fig. 5C, a′–d′). In contrast, cells depleted of Zwint-1 (Fig. 5C, a) or ZW10 (Fig. 5C, e) protein exited mitosis without nuclei dividing and separating, which formed highly aberrant nuclei that were probably polyploid (Fig. 5C, b and f, respectively). As shown in Fig. 5D, a summary from three different experiments showed that the depletion of Zwint-1 resulted in significant increases in cells bearing aberrant multinuclei (65.5 ± 7.9%; p < 0.01 compared with that of control). A survey of ZW10-depleted cells from three different experiments indicated that loss of ZW10 generated a large fraction of aberrant multinuclei (57.9 ± 5.9%; p < 0.01 compared with that of control), which is similar to that seen in Zwint-1-depleted cells. Conversely, there were dramatic decreases in the number of mitotic cells in Zwint-1-depleted cells, which was a hallmark of checkpoint failure. We next examined whether the loss of ZW10 and Zwint-1 from kinetochores affected the ability of other checkpoint proteins to bind to kinetochores. Loss of Zwint-1 and ZW10 from kinetochores also did not affect the ability of Bub1 to bind to kinetochores in mitotic cells that were not treated with nocodazole (Fig. 4, r). Kinetochores depleted in Zwint-1 and ZW10 retained Bub1 in mitotic cells that were exposed to nocodazole (data not shown). These data demonstrate that loss of Zwint-1 is responsible for mitotic checkpoint signaling. We have identified and characterized Zwint-1 as an important ZW10-binding partner that links ZW10 to the kinetochore and mitotic checkpoint. The temporal order of Zwint-1 prior to that of ZW10, together with the fact that elimination Zwint-1 liberates ZW10 from the kinetochore, indicates that Zwint-1 is required for ZW10 association with the kinetochore. We have examined the in vivo inter-relationship of the kinetochore proteins Zwint-1, ZW10, and CENP-F, and we found that ZW10 and CENP-F depend on Zwint-1 for stable association with the kinetochore. In addition, ZW10 and Zwint-1 proteins are required for the assembly of the dynein-dynactin complex onto kinetochores. These results are consistent with those reported for Drosophila ZW10 and ROD (16Yao X. Anderson K.L. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and for human ZW10 (17Basto R. Gomes R. Karess R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, we elucidate the molecular basis of how ZW10 targets to the kinetochore. However, the low protein expression level of these ZW10 deletion mutants observed did not give any obvious mitotic phenotypes. We demonstrated that Zwint-1 is an important component of the spindle checkpoint. Cells depleted of Zwint-1 failed to block mitosis in the presence of the spindle damage treated by the microtubule inhibitor nocodazole. In addition, Zwint-1 is critical for normal mitotic progression as cells lacking Zwint-1 exited mitosis with entangled chromosomes and unseparated sister chromatids, which led to formation of cells containing multinuclei and the genesis of aneuploidy phenotypes. This is a hallmark of the perturbation of the mitotic checkpoint that forces cells to exit mitosis prematurely, before all the chromosomes are aligned correctly. This phenotype resembles those observed when the functions of spindle checkpoint proteins Mad2, Bub1, BubR1, ZW10, and MPS1 were disrupted (19Shah J.V. Cleveland D.W.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our findings are also consistent with loss of ROD and ZW10 function (17Basto R. Gomes R. Karess R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the roles of ROD and ZW10 in mitotic checkpoint surveillance. In fact, ZW10 and ROD mutant flies were found to degrade cyclin B prematurely and to separate their sister chromatids precociously, which can potentially explain the high incidence of aneuploidy. Previous studies show that neither ZW10 nor ROD is required by kinetochores to bind MAD1 and BUBR1 or to release these proteins in response to microtubule interactions (18Cleveland D.W. Mao Y. Sullivan K.F. Cell. 2003; 112: 407-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that BUB1 first localizes to the kinetochore followed by CENP-F and BUBR1, raising the possibility that CENP-F may be essential for association of BUBR1 to the kinetochore (22Johnson V.L. Scott M.I. Holt S.V. Hussein D. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1577-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In fact, a preliminary measure of pixel intensities revealed that suppression of Zwint-1, but not ZW10, by siRNA reduced kinetochore-bound BUBR1 levels by 61%. 2Z. Dou and X. Yao, unpublished observations. The fact that depletion of Zwint-1 attenuates the association of BUBR1 to the kinetochore provides a novel molecular basis to account for BUBR1 association with kinetochore. Given the differential requirement for assembly of CENP-E, CENP-F and BUBR1 to the kinetochore, our studies support the notion in which the kinetochore assembly involves several distinct but interactive pathways. Cancer cells are often defective in maintaining a mitotic block in response to microtubule disruptors such as nocodazole and taxol, which leads to mis-segregation of chromosomes and biogenesis of aneuploidy (23Chen R.H. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that haplo-insufficiency (loss of an allele) of the BUBR1 protein resulted in rapidly developing lung as well as intestinal adenocarcinomas in response to challenge with a carcinogen (24Dai W. Wang Q. Liu T. Swamy M. Fang Y. Xie S. Mahmood R. Yang Y.M. Xu M. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In fact, we have shown recently (25Kops G.J. Foltz D.R. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8699-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) that suppression of BUBR1 mitotic checkpoint signaling by either reduction of BUBR1 protein level or inhibiting BUBR1 kinase activity in human cancer cells is invariably lethal as the consequence of massive chromosome loss. Insufficiency to assemble BUBR1 onto kinetochores in Zwint-1-depleted cells and the subsequent occurrence of aneuploidy in the presence of nocodazole mirrored the phenotype seen in the BUBR1 haplo-insufficiency in genetically manipulated mouse cells (24Dai W. Wang Q. Liu T. Swamy M. Fang Y. Xie S. Mahmood R. Yang Y.M. Xu M. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, aberrant function of Zwint-1 pathway could lead to aberrant assembly of BUBR1 to kinetochores, which provides another mechanism to compromise the mitotic spindle checkpoint in addition to BUBR1 mutations found in colorectal cancer patients (26Cahill D.P. Lengauer C. Yu J. Riggins G.J. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 392: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 27Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). It would be of great interest to explore whether any cancer cells exhibit disrupted Zwint-1 activity. Our experimentation of manipulation of Zwint-1 expression and activity shown here may provide a useful system to dissect signaling cascade underlying Zwint-1-ZW10-mediated mitotic signaling cascade, which will aid in elucidating the pathogenesis of chromosome instability and identification of the other components that are involved in mitotic checkpoint signaling. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a critical role of Zwint-1 in kinetochore assembly dynamics. The fact that elimination of Zwint-1 disrupts assembly of ZW10, CENP-F, and dynamitin to kinetochores, abrogates nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest, and induces chromosome cross-bridges in HeLa cells prematurely exited from anaphase demonstrates the importance of Zwint-1 in faithful chromosome segregation.

The Rab2-generated vesicles are enriched in recycling proteins suggesting that the carriers are retrograde-directed and retrieve transport machinery back to the endoplasmic reticulum. These vesicles also contained the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). We have previously established that GAPDH is required for membrane transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex.

In addition to its glycolytic function, GAPDH has multiple intracellular roles. However, the function of GAPDH in the early secretory pathway is unknown. One possibility is that GAPDH ultimately provides energy in the form of ATP. To determine whether GAPDH catalytic activity was critical for transport in the early secretory pathway, a conservative substitution was made at Cys-149 located at the active site, and the mutant was biochemically characterized in a battery of assays. Although GAPDH (C149G) has no catalytic activity, Rab2 recruited the mutant protein to membranes in a quantitative binding assay.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The retrieval of membranes from VTCs back to the ER is essential to preserve organelle identity and allows reuse of the transport machinery required for ER export. Rab2 bound to a VTC subcompartment promotes recruitment of soluble components that facilitate membrane fission and cytoskeletal interaction resulting in the release of retrograde-directed vesicles (5Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol.

One of the components recruited by Rab2 is atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (aPKCι/λ), which binds to the N terminus of Rab2 (8Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). aPKCι/λ kinase activity is essential for Rab2-mediated retrograde vesicle formation (8Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Rab2-generated vesicles also contain glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In fact, GAPDH recruitment to VTCs is required for membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi complex (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, GAPDH is a substrate for aPKCι/λ and interacts directly with aPKCι/λ via the regulatory domain (7Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GAPDH catalyzes the NAD-mediated oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) to 1,3-diphosphoglycerate. However, it has become increasingly clear that this enzyme has multiple intracellular activities in addition to its role in glycolysis. These activities include promoting membrane-membrane fusion, modulation of the cytoskeleton, DNA repair, DNA replication, and tRNA export (11Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these diverse GAPDH functions may be dictated by the subcellular location of the enzyme that allows association with compartment specific proteins including posttranslational modifying enzymes resulting in the many GAPDH isoforms that have been detected (7Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Mazzola J. Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Gross R.W. Biochem. 1995; 34: 12193-12203Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These modifications could potentially impart a new activity to GAPDH and allow it to switch function.Since Rab2 interacts with aPKCι/λ and aPKCι/λ associates with GAPDH, it seemed plausible that Rab2 might also directly bind GAPDH. Indeed, we found using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays that Rab2 associates with GAPDH suggesting that Rab2, aPKCι/λ, and GAPDH form a complex on VTCs. GAPDH binds to residues 20–50 in Rab2. This Rab2 sequence includes the putative switch I domain that undergoes guanine nucleotide-dependent conformational changes recognized by Rab regulatory factors.Although GAPDH interacts with Rab2 and aPKCι/λ on VTCs and is required for ER to Golgi transport, the precise function of GAPDH in the early secretory pathway is unknown. GAPDH associated with VTCs could ultimately provide energy in the form of ATP, a factor essential for membrane trafficking. To address the question whether GAPDH catalytic activity was critical for transport in the early secretory pathway, a conservative substitution was made at the invariant residue (Cys-149) located at the active site. As expected, GAPDH (C149G) was inactive when evaluated in a glycolytic activity assay. GAPDH (C149G) was further characterized biochemically to be assured that the mutation did not affect other physiological properties in addition to loss of enzyme activity. By employing a quantitative microsomal binding assay we found that Rab2 recruited the mutant protein to membranes and that the membrane-associated form was the tetrameric species. Moreover, GAPDH (C149G) binds directly to Rab2 and aPKCι/λ. Importantly, purified recombinant GAPDH (C149G) rescued VSV-G transport between the ER and Golgi complex when an in vitro trafficking assay was supplemented with GAPDH-depleted cytosol. These combined results suggest that GAPDH provides a specific function essential for membrane trafficking from VTCs that does not require GAPDH glycolytic activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The human expression-tested clone GAPDH pDual was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Rab2 N-terminal peptides were synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility (Ann Arbor, MI). The Mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA).Construction of Rab2 N-terminal Deletion Mutants, Rab2-Rab1 Chimeras, and GAPDH Catalytically Inactive Mutant—N-terminal deletions of human Rab2 were generated as previously described (9Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Reciprocal exchanges between human Rab2 and rat Rab1b were made by a two-step PCR procedure involving two complementary overlapping oligonucleotides in combination with flanking 5′- and 3′-primers for either Rab2 or Rab1. To generate the Rab1-(1–52)/Rab2-(50–211) chimera, the first reaction was performed with overlapping 5′- and 3′-fragments using Rab1 as the template. The 5′ sense primer (5′-GCCACATATGAACCCCGAATATGACTAC-3′) and the 3′ antisense primer (5′-TTTTATCTGTTTCCCATCAATCAGTTCAATGGTTCGAATCTT-3′) were used to amplify the first 156 base pairs of Rab1. The 5′-portion of Rab2-(50–211) was generated using Rab2 as the template and the overlapping primer; 5′-AAGAATCGAACCATTGAACTGATTGATGGGAAACAGATAAAA-3′ in tandem with the 3′ antisense primer that included an EcoRI site; 5′-GGCAGAATTCGTCAACAGCAGCCCCCAGC-3′. The two PCR products were combined to generate the full-length mutant in a second reaction using the Rab1 sense primer and Rab2 antisense primer. To generate the Rab2-(1–50)/Rab1-(52–201) chimera, the first reaction was performed with overlapping 5′- and 3′-fragments using Rab2 as the template. The 5′ sense primer (5′-GGCCATGGCGGTACGCCTATCTCTTCAAGTAC-3′) and the 3′ antisense primer (5′-GATTTGATGGTTTTGCCATCCAGAATAGTTATCATTCGAGCACCCTT -3′) were used to amplify the first 150 base pairs of Rab2. The 5′ portion of Rab1 (52–201) was generated using Rab1 as the template and the overlapping primer; 5′-AAGGGTGCTCGAATGATAACTATTGTCGATGGCAAAACCATCAAACT-3′ in tandem with the 3′ antisense primer that included an EcoRI site; (5′-GGCAGAATTCGCTAGCAGCAGCCACCACT-3′). The two PCR products were combined to generate the full-length mutant in a second reaction using the Rab2 sense primer and Rab1 antisense primer. The chimeras were subcloned into pGEX2T (Amersham Biosciences) and into the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pM vector as described below. The GAPDH catalytically inactive mutant (C149G) was made by a two-step PCR procedure involving two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides in combination with flanking 5′- and 3′-primers. In the first reaction, overlapping 5′- and 3′-fragments were produced using pDual GAPDH as the template. The 5′ mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CAGCAATGCCTCCGGGACCACCAACTGCTTAGCACC-3′) and the 3′ wild-type antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GGATCCTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTGGGCCATGAGGTCCAC-3′) were used to produce the 3′-portion of the molecule. The 5′-portion of the molecule was generated using either a 5′-oligonucleotide primer that included an NdeI or a BamHI site (5′-GGCCATATGGGGAAGGTGAAGGTC-3′) in combination with the 3′-mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-GGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTCCCGGAGGCATTGCTG-3′). The two PCR products were combined to generate the full-length mutant in a second reaction using the respective 5′-sense and 3′-antisense primers. GAPDH wild type and GAPDH (C149G) were subcloned into pET15B (Novagen, Madison, WI) and pGEX2T. The sequence of all constructs was verified by automated DNA sequence analysis.Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (2 × 106) were lysed in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 8.0) and 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice, and then clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was precleared with protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Novagen) and subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at room temperature with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody (10 μg) or with preimmune serum and protein G plus/protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, washed 3× with TBS, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm NaCl, and then boiled in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in TBS that contained 5% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with an anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody and an anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse antibody, and then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences).Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Human Rab2, Rab2/Rab1, and Rab1/Rab2 cDNA was cloned in-frame to the EcoRI site of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pM vector and GAPDH cDNA cloned in-frame to the EcoRI site of the activation domain in pVP16 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). The two constructs (5 μg each) were co-transfected with the reporter vector pG5CAT (5 μg) that contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into HeLa cells (105) using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (15Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4810) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with a combination of vectors as described under “Results.” The cells were collected 72 h post-transfection, lysed in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked as described above, incubated with an anti-CAT polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen Life Technologies), washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL.Overlay Binding Assay—Purified recombinant Rab2 (5 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated in 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgOAc, 100 mm KOAc, 10 mg/ml BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.3% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C to renature the protein. The blot was then incubated in 12.5 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm MgOAc, 75 mm KOAc, 0.1% BSA, 10 μm GTPγS, 200 mm NaCl, and 10 μg/ml purified recombinant His6-GAPDH or His6-GAPDH (C149G) for 4 h at room temperature (7Tisdale E.J.

After incubation, the blot was washed with TBS, and then probed with a GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon), washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL.GST Pull-down—BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) that contained the recombinant plasmids GST-GAPDH, GST-Rab2/Rab1, GST-Rab1/Rab2, or GST-Rab1 were grown at 37 °C to an OD600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The liquid culture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellet resuspended in cold TBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, sonicated, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min, and then the supernatant applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10-bed volumes of TBS, and the fusion protein eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione. GST-GAPDH, GST-Rab2-(1–50), GST-Rab2-(51–211), or GST (5 μg) were preincubated with 20 μl of glutathione Sepharose 4B for 1 h at room temperature, collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min, and then washed 3× with TBS and 1% Triton X-100 to remove any unbound protein. The beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GTPγS, or 10 μm GDP (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Irvine, CA), and then 5 μg of either Rab2 or His6-GAPDH added and incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed 4× with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked as above and the membrane probed with an anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon Intl.) or an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody, or a GST tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen), washed, incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL.ELISA—ELISA was performed as described previously (9Tisdale E.J.

Briefly, Nunc immunomodules were coated with peptides and purified Rab2 N-terminal-truncated recombinant proteins (1 μg/100 μ l of 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) listed in Table I at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed in TBS, blocked in TBS and 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37 °C, additionally washed in TBS, and then incubated with 5 μg of purified recombinant His6-GAPDH for 3 h at 37 °C. After each well was washed 3× with TBS, a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Chemicon) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GTPγS was added for 2 h at 37 °C, washed, and further incubated with an antimouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary reagent for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were again washed with TBS, developed with Sigma FAST p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and then read at 405 nm on a microplate reader.Table IBinding studies to map GAPDH binding domain in Rab2Rab2 N′-truncation proteins and N′-terminal peptidesA405Rab2365 ± 23Rab2 N′Δ 8321 ± 16Rab2 N′Δ14275 ± 14Rab2 N′Δ19214 ± 18(7-mer) AYAYLFK0(13-mer) AYAYLFKYIIIGD0(random) AYKAGYIDLYIFI0(19-mer) AYAYLFKYIIIGDTGVGK0 Open table in a new tab Assay for GAPDH Activity—Purified recombinant His6-GAPDH or His6-GAPDH (C149G) (1 μg) were incubated in 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate (pH 8.5), 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.25 mm β-NAD (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH), and 3 μm dithiothreitol at 25 °C for 5 min to establish a baseline. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.4 μm glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich), and the catalytic reduction of NAD to NADH was monitored at the indicated times described under “Results” by an increase in absorbance at 340 nm. The GAPDH units correspond to the mass (μm) of GAPDH converted per min per mg. The mass of NADH generated was calculated using ϵ = 0.622Analysis of Transport in Vitro—NRK cells were infected for 4 h with the temperature-sensitive VSV strain ts045, and then biosynthetically radiolabeled with 100 μCi Expre35S35S (specific activity 1175 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Science Products) for 10 min at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) to maintain the VSV-G mutant protein in the ER. The cells were then perforated by swelling and scraping and employed in the ER to cis/medial Golgi transport assay as described (17Beckers C.J.M. Keller D.S. Balch W.E. Cell. 1987; 50: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Transport reactions were performed in a final volume of 40 μl in a buffer which contains 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 75 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-acetylglucosamine, an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 international units of rabbit muscle creatine phosphokinase), 5 μl of semi-intact cells (∼5 × 107 cells/ml, ∼25–30 μg of total protein) resuspended in 50 mm Hepes-KOH, 90 mm KOAc (pH 7.2), and 5 μl of rat liver cytosol depleted of GAPDH by batch absorbed on Blue Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Chemicon) and protein G plus/protein A-agarose. The reactions were supplemented with the indicated concentration of purified recombinant His6-GAPDH or His6-GAPDH (C149G), incubated at 32 °C for a total of 60 min, and then transferred to ice to terminate transport. Membranes were pelleted by centrifugation, solubilized in buffer, and digested with endoglycosidase H (endo H). The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the fraction of ts045 VSV-G protein processed to the endo H-resistant forms quantitated by a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Quantitative Membrane-binding Assay—HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 mm Hepes pH 7.2 and 250 mm mannitol, and then broken with 15 passes of a 27-gauge syringe. The broken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant removed and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet containing ER, pre-Golgi, and Golgi membranes was washed with 1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) for 15 min on ice to remove peripherally associated proteins, re-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and then the membrane pellet resuspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol and employed in the binding reaction, as described previously (5Tisdale E.J. Jackson M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17269-17277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Tisdale E.J.

Membranes (30 μg of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture, which contained 27.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.75 mm MgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 units of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. Recombinant Rab2 and His6-GAPDH (C149G) were added at the concentrations indicated under “Results,” and the reaction mix incubated on ice for 10 min. GAPDH-depleted rat liver cytosol (50 μg) and 2.0 μm GTPγS were added, and the reactions shifted to 37 °C and incubated for 12 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked as above, incubated with a His tag (27E8) monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody, developed with ECL, and then quantitated by densitometry.RESULTSRab2 Interacts Directly with GAPDH—Our previous studies showed that Rab2 recruits GAPDH to membranes in a dose-dependent manner (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To explore the possibility that Rab2-GAPDH physically associate, we employed a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. First, the detergent lysate from HeLa cells was incubated with preimmune serum or with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody. Rab2 and GAPDH co-immunoprecipitated whereas no interaction was detected with preimmune serum as assessed by Western blot analysis of the immune complex (Fig. 1A). This is the same reagent that co-precipitates Rab2 and aPKCι/λ (9Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).To further verify Rab2-GAPDH interaction in vivo, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid assay that was used previously to demonstrate Rab2-aPKCι/λ in vivo association (9Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52524-52530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This system allows detection of transient and weak protein-protein interactions. For this assay, Rab2 cDNA was used as bait and cloned into pM to generate a GAL4 DNA binding domain-Rab2 fusion protein whereas GAPDH cDNA that serves as prey was cloned into pVP16 to generate a VP16 activation domain-GAPDH fusion protein. HeLa cells were cotransfected with these two constructs and with a reporter plasmid that contains the CAT gene. If the two fusion proteins interact in vivo, transcription of the CAT reporter gene is activated. Three days post-transfection, the cells were lysed in sample buffer and the lysate separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-CAT polyclonal antibody. Cells co-transfected with pM-Rab2 and pVP16-GAPDH expressed ∼20-fold higher level of CAT protein compared with controls cells indicating that Rab2 and GAPDH interacted in vivo (Fig. 1B, lane d).This potential in vivo interaction was further evaluated in a blot overlay assay that is routinely used to identify Rab-interacting proteins (18Horiuchi H. Lippe R. McBride H. Rubino M. Woodman P. Stenmark H. Rybin H. Wilm M. Ashman K. Mann M. Zerial M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Rab2 was separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane incubated in overlay buffer supplemented with purified recombinant His6-GAPDH. Any GAPDH bound to Rab2 was detected after incubation with a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH followed by a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and development with ECL. Consistent with the in vivo results, we detected His6-GAPDH binding to Rab2 (Fig. 1C). This in vitro result was further confirmed in a GST pull-down experiment in which GST-GAPDH was first immobilized on glutathione Sepharose 4B, and then incubated with purified recombinant Rab2 in a buffer containing GTPγS or GDP. After extensive washing, agarose beads containing GST-GAPDH retained Rab2-GTPγS whereas minimal interaction was detected with Rab2-GDP (Fig. 1D). These collective results indicate that activated Rab2 interacts directly with GAPDH.To map the GAPDH binding site in Rab2, we aligned the sequence of Rab2 with Rab1 and swapped the corresponding residues (1–50), and then evaluated the chimeras in the mammalian two-hybrid assay described above. Like Rab2, Rab1 is essential for trafficking in the early secretory pathway (1Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Cells co-transfected with pM-Rab2/Rab1 and pVP16-GAPDH expressed ∼15-fold higher level of CAT protein compared with the reverse construct and the control suggesting that GAPDH interacts with the first 50 residues in Rab2 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2GAPDH binds to residues 1–50 in Rab2. A, lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected for 72 h with: lane a, pG5CAT, pM, and pVP16 (basal control), or lane b, pM-Rab2, pVP-16 and pG5CAT (pM control), or lane c, pM, pVP16-GAPDH, and pG5CAT (pVP16 control), or lane d, pVP16-PKCι/λ, pM-Rab2/Rab1, and pG5CAT (experiment) lane e, pVP16-PKCι/λ, pM-Rab1/Rab2, and pG5CAT (experiment) were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was probed with an anti-CAT polyclonal antibody, washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL. B, GST (5 μg), GST-Rab2/Rab1 (5 μg), GST-Rab1/Rab2 (5 μg), or GST-Rab1 (5 μg) were preincubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed 3× with TBS and 1% Triton X-100 to remove any unbound protein. The beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GTPγS, 100 mm NaCl, and then 5 μg of purified recombinant His6-GAPDH added and incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The beads were washed 4× with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm"
https://openalex.org/W2157267028,"The phage shock protein operon (pspABCDE) of Escherichia coli is strongly up-regulated in response to overexpression of the filamentous phage secretin protein IV (pIV) and by many other stress conditions including defects in protein export. PspA has an established role in maintenance of the proton-motive force of the cell under stress conditions. Here we present evidence for a new member of the phage shock response in E. coli. Using transcriptional profiling, we show that the synthesis of pIV in E. coli leads to a highly restricted response limited to the up-regulation of the psp operon genes and yjbO. The psp operon and yjbO are also up-regulated in response to pIV in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. yjbO is a highly conserved gene found exclusively in bacteria that contain a psp operon but is physically unlinked to the psp operon. yjbO encodes a putative inner membrane protein that is co-controlled with the psp operon genes and is predicted to be an effector of the psp response in E. coli. We present evidence that yjbO expression is driven by σ54-RNA polymerase, activated by PspF and integration host factor, and negatively regulated by PspA. PspF specifically regulates only members of the PspF regulon: pspABCDE and yjbO. We found that increased expression of YjbO results in decreased motility of bacteria. Because yjbO is co-conserved and co-regulated with the psp operon and is a member of the phage shock protein F regulon, we propose that yjbO be renamed pspG.

PspF specifically regulates only members of the PspF regulon: pspABCDE and yjbO. We found that increased expression of YjbO results in decreased motility of bacteria. Because yjbO is co-conserved and co-regulated with the psp operon and is a member of the phage shock protein F regulon, we propose that yjbO be renamed pspG. The phage shock protein operon (pspABCDE) was first characterized in Escherichia coli (1Brissette J.L. Russel M. Weiner L. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and is highly conserved in many Gram-negative bacteria including several pathogens. There is good evidence that the psp genes are involved in protecting the bacterial cell during infectious processes. For example, pspC mutants of Yersinia enterocolitica are severely attenuated for virulence during infection (2Darwin A.J. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and exhibit growth defects when the type III secretion system is expressed (3Darwin A.J. Miller V.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Significantly, the psp genes are among the most highly up-regulated genes in Salmonella typhimurium during macrophage infection (4Eriksson S. Lucchini S. Thompson A. Rhen M. Hinton J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The psp operon is also up-regulated during swarming in S. typhimurium (5Wang Q. Frye J.G. McClelland M. Harshey R.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 169-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and during biofilm formation in E. coli (6Beloin C. Valle J. Latour-Lambert P. Faure P. Kzreminski M. Balestrino D. Haagensen J.A. Molin S. Prensier G. Arbeille B. Ghigo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 659-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Expression of the psp operon in E. coli is induced by protein IV (pIV), 1The abbreviations used are: pIV, protein IV; IHF, integration host factor; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcriptase. a secretin from filamentous phage f1 (1Brissette J.L. Russel M. Weiner L. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). pIV forms a pore in the bacterial outer membrane that is required for the assembly and export of filamentous phage (7Russel M. Kazmierczak B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Opalka N. Beckmann R. Boisset N. Simon M.N. Russel M. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The pIV protein is the founding member of a large family of bacterial secretins, all of which form large multimeric export channels in the outer membrane. Overexpression of several secretins, often components of the type II and type III bacterial secretion systems, has also been shown to induce expression of the psp operon (e.g. Refs. 7Russel M. Kazmierczak B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3998-4007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Possot O. d'Enfert C. Reyss I. Pugsley A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) establishing that the response is not restricted to a phage protein. Expression of the psp operon can also be induced following overexpression of mutant forms of the outer membrane protein PhoE that are not efficiently secreted (10Kleerebezem M. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PspA synthesis is switched on under conditions that block or reduce the efficiency of the export apparatus, for example, mutants in secA, secD, and secF (10Kleerebezem M. Tommassen J. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and depletion of YidC (11van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutations in components of the twin-arginine translocation pathway also leads to PspA induction under anaerobic conditions (Ref. 13DeLisa M.P. Lee P. Palmer T. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and see also Ref. 12Jones S.E. Lloyd L.J. Tan K.K. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other more general stresses including extreme heat shock (50 °C), hyperosmotic shock, ethanol treatment (10%), and uncouplers of proton-motive force induce psp (reviewed in Ref. 14Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The common factor that may link psp-inducing stresses is their effect in dissipating proton-motive force. Indeed, it is significant that PspA, an effector protein of the phage shock response, is known to be involved in maintaining proton-motive force under stress conditions (15Kleerebezem M. Crielaard W. Tommassen J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 162-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition to Psp protein homologues in other Gram-negative bacteria, a PspA homologue (VIPP1) has been found in Synechocystis, which is thought to be important in thylakoid formation, consistent with a role of PspA in sustaining membrane function (16Westphal S. Heins L. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4243-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Psp proteins mediate regulation of the psp operon (17Weiner L. Brissette J.L. Model P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Adams H. Teertstra W. Koster M. Tommassen J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 518: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transcription of the psp operon is driven by the σ54-RNA polymerase (σ54-RNAP) (17Weiner L. Brissette J.L. Model P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which is activated by the enhancer binding protein PspF (19Jovanovic G. Weiner L. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1936-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and facilitated by integration host factor (IHF) (20Jovanovic G. Model P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The expression of PspF is negatively autogenously controlled (21Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5232-5237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PspA negatively regulates psp transcription by binding to the activator protein PspF (22Dworkin J. Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Conversely, PspB and PspC act as positive regulators of psp operon transcription by overcoming the negative regulation imposed by PspA under specific inducing conditions (e.g. pIV) (17Weiner L. Brissette J.L. Model P. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1912-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Brissette J.L. Weiner L. Ripmaster T.L. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 35-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Weiner L. Brissette J.L. Ramani N. Model P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phenotypes of cells lacking the psp operon are very subtle and include reduced survival in stationary phase at alkaline pH and changed motility (14Model P. Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Here we have used whole genome transcriptional profiling to determine the global effect of pIV synthesis in E. coli. In the highly restricted response we have identified one new gene associated with the psp system, pspG (previously yjbO). pspG is physically unlinked with the psp operon but is co-conserved and co-regulated with the psp operon genes by σ54, PspF, IHF, and PspA. Several lines of evidence suggest that PspG is an effector of the phage shock system and not a regulator of psp expression. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. MG1655ΔpspA, MG1655ΔpspBC, and MG1655ΔpspF were constructed as described in Ref. 12Jones S.E. Lloyd L.J. Tan K.K. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar.

MVA42 was constructed by transducing pspG::kn from JWK5716_1 (Km+) into MG1655ΔpspA. Strains were grown aerobically with shaking at 37 °C. For microarray analyses, strains were grown to mid-exponential phase in N-C-minimal media (33Kustu S. Burton D. Garcia E. McCarter L. McFarland N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the initial microarray experiments, RNA was fluorescently labeled during reverse transcription and cDNA was hybridized to E. coli PCR product microarrays according to S. Kustu and co-workers (37Zimmer D.P. Soupene E. Lee H.L. Wendisch V.F. Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Bender R.A. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Experiments were performed in duplicate with a dye swap. The microarray data for the pIV experiments were generated with fluorescently labeled genomic DNA as a reference channel in each experiment using E. coli and S. typhimurium PCR product microarrays printed at IFR (39Anjum M.F.

Experiments were performed in quadruplicate, consisting of two biological replicates and two technical replicates. Microarray slides were scanned with a Genepix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments). Fluorescent spot and local background intensities were quantified using Genepix Pro software. For labeling, hybridization, and data analysis protocols and details of statistical filtering procedures, see the online site (ifr.bbsrc.ac.uk/Safety/Microarrays/#Protocols). Further statistical analysis was carried out using Cyber-T (visitor.ics.uci.edu/genex/cybert/). RT-PCR—Qiagen® One-step RT-PCR kit was used according to the manufacturer' instructions to amplify pspA (20 cycles) and pspG (35 cycles) from RNA samples. For amplifying pspA the primers RT-PspA(a) (5′-CTCGCTTTGCCGACATCGTGAATG-3′) and RT-PspA(b) (5′-TGCCAGTTGTTCGCTGATTGCATC-3′) were used. For amplifying pspG the primers RT-PspG(a) (5′-GCTGGAACTACTTTTTGTGATTGG-3′) and RT-PspG(b) (5′-CGCCAGCGGTCATAACGCTGATAT-3′) were used. Western Blotting—Western blotting was carried out as described (23Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using primary antibodies to PspA (12Jones S.E. Lloyd L.J. Tan K.K. Buck M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6707-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and pIV (a gift from Marjorie Russel). pIV antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described (35Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Bioinformatics Methods—Fuzzpro (EMBOSS programs) was used to search for consensus sequences in regions of DNA by allowing small numbers of mismatches to be introduced to the search. DNase I Footprinting Assays—DNase I footprinting reactions (10 μl) were carried out at 37 °C in STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000) essentially as described (42Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Ishihama A. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29728-29743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0-400 nm Eσ54 (reconstituted in situ with 1:2 molar ratio of E and σ54) or 0-1 μmE. coli PspF was incubated with 15 nm pLL1 for 10 min and treated with 1.75 × 10-3 units of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 min. The DNase I reaction was quenched by the addition of DNase I stop buffer (400 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS) and the DNA was purified using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNase I protected regions were identified by primer extension PCR as described (42Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Ishihama A. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29728-29743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using 0.5 μl of 1 μm γ-32P-end labeled primers pPspG1 (5′-GAACACGCGCTCAAACTGGTGGCGG-3′) (for σ54 binding) and pPspG2 (5′-CTGGCGCGCGGCAGTGGCGGC-3′) (for PspF binding). In Vitro Transcription Assay—In vitro transcription reactions (10 μl) were carried out as described (43Wigneshweraraj S.R. Nechaev S. Bordes P. Jones S. Cannon W. Severinov K. Buck M. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 370: 646-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with a 1:5 ratio RNAP to σ54 and with plasmids pSLE1 (pspA) or pJH2 (pspG). Motility Assay—Motility assays were carried out using motility agar (1% tryptone, 0.5% NaCl and 0.3% agar) plus the appropriate antibiotic. 2 μl of a fully grown LB overnight culture was pipetted into the motility agar, plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, and zones of motility were measured in millimeters. pIV Secretin Stress Results in the Up-regulation of pspABCDE and pspG—To examine the transcriptional response to pIV-induced stress in E. coli wild type MG1655 cells containing the plasmids, pPMR129 (pIV) or pGZ119EH (vector control) were grown to mid-log phase, expression from the plasmids was induced with IPTG for 1 h, and cells were harvested for RNA extraction. The synthesis of pIV reached high levels after 1 h (see Supplementary Materials and Fig. 1) indicating that it should elicit a full cellular response but did not lead to reduced growth rates, or reduced yields of cells, indicating a lack of toxicity. Microarray analyses showed increased levels of psp operon transcripts in pIV-expressing cells compared with the vector control (Fig. 1A). We correlated activation of the pspA promoter with increased levels of the PspA protein using Western blotting (data not shown). Other than the psp operon genes, only a single gene, yjbO, showed a significant and sizeable up-regulation in response to pIV secretin stress (Fig. 1A; see Supplementary Materials Tables I and III). This data indicates that large transcriptional responses of E. coli to pIV are very rare and identify a new gene involved in the phage shock response, yjbO. We propose to rename this gene pspG. To confirm that transcript levels of pspG are increased in wild type MG1655 cells expressing pIV, RT-PCR was carried out on the RNA samples used for the microarray experiments. RT-PCR clearly demonstrates that pspG transcription is up-regulated, along with pspA transcription, in pIV-expressing MG1655 cells compared with the vector control (Fig. 2A). β-Galactosidase assays using a translational reporter for PspG (pLL1) confirm that PspG is produced in response to pIV in MC1061 cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the response to pIV detected in E. coli is conserved in other bacteria that contain the psp operon, a pIV expression experiment was carried out in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2. There is significant up-regulation of psp operon and pspG transcripts in the pIV-expressing S. typhimurium cells (Fig. 1B; see Supplementary Materials Tables I and III). The transcriptional response to pIV in S. typhimurium resembles that of E. coli in that the response to pIV secretin stress is highly restricted. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis of responses of E. coli and S. typhimurium to pIV shows that the common core of up-regulated genes are pspABCDE and pspG. Transcription of pspF does not show any change in response to pIV expression, consistent with control of PspF being exclusively at the level of activity (21Jovanovic G. Dworkin J. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5232-5237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such a limited and specific response to pIV stress resembles the response of E. coli cells to IPTG, a gratuitous inducer of the E. coli lac operon. We performed a microarray experiment to show that IPTG only causes significant increased expression of lac operon genes in MG1655, no other transcriptome changes occur (see Supplementary Materials Table II). As with lac promoter activity induced by IPTG, the effect of pIV inducing stimulus under our growth conditions in E. coli appears to be close to gratuitous (44Monod J. Cohn M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Sub. Biochem. 1952; 13: 67-119PubMed Google Scholar). pspG Transcription Is Regulated by psp-encoded Proteins—To examine the effect of overexpression of the psp genes on the transcriptome, transcripts from cells lacking the negative regulator PspA (MG1655ΔpspA) were compared with transcripts from cells lacking the positive regulator PspF (MG1655ΔpspF). In MG1655ΔpspA, the psp operon is expressed at high levels because the negative regulator of its transcription has been removed. Conversely, in MG1655ΔpspF, expression of the psp operon is completely absent because the activator protein required for σ54-RNAP driven transcription has been removed. Levels of psp expression in the MG1655ΔpspA strain are therefore close to levels in wild type cells expressing pIV, but without the production of PspA. It is clear from Fig. 3 that pspBCDE is transcribed at high levels in MG1655ΔpspA compared with MG1655ΔpspF. As with the response of wild type MG1655 cells to pIV stress, there is very little transcriptional change across the whole genome in response to overexpression of psp genes in MG1655ΔpspA, with the clear exception of the gene pspG, which is strongly up-regulated. The level of expression from the pspA promoter and the pspG promoter was similar when we compared wild type cells expressing pIV to cells lacking PspA, the only known negative regulator of psp expression. This result establishes that pIV is a strong and effective inducing signal. We considered that the synthesis of pIV in mutants unable to mount a wild type Psp response might result in additional changes in the transcriptome to compensate for the inability of the cell to adapt to stress arising through the failure to express the psp genes. MG1655ΔpspA, MG1655ΔpspBC, and MG1655ΔpspF cells containing pPMR129 (pIV) and pGZ119-EH (vector control) were grown to mid-log phase and induced with IPTG. The synthesis of pIV reached high levels after 1 h (see Supplementary Materials Fig. 1), which is consistent with the observation that filamentous phage grow normally in psp mutants (1Brissette J.L. Russel M. Weiner L. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 862-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The psp mutant strains did not show any growth defects on expression of pIV. Microarray analysis showed that synthesis of pIV in MG1655ΔpspA, MG1655ΔpspBC, and MG1655ΔpspF does not cause any pIV-dependent changes in the transcriptome attributable to the loss of PspA, PspBC, or PspF, respectively (see Supplementary Materials Table I). pspG was not further up-regulated in MG1655ΔpspA, MG1655ΔpspBC, or MG1655ΔpspF cells when expressing pIV, probably because the psp operon, and therefore pspG, were constitutively on in MG1655ΔpspA and always off in MG1655ΔpspBC and MG1655ΔpspF. This data shows that expression of pspG is negatively regulated by PspA and its transcription may be activated by PspF via a σ54 promoter and positively regulated by PspBC. The psp Operon and pspG Are Co-conserved and Co-regulated—pspG and pspFpspABCDE are not physically linked on the chromosome, but pspG is highly conserved among bacteria in which the psp operon is conserved. Furthermore, all bacteria containing a recognizable psp operon carry a pspG homologue, and pspG homologues are not present in bacteria lacking a psp operon. This shows that the pspG and psp loci are co-conserved. PspG is a small (∼9 kDa) highly hydrophobic protein that is predicted to be an inner membrane protein (enzim.hu/hmmtop/http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Because our experiments indicated that pspG transcription is regulated by the same elements that regulate psp operon transcription, we used a bioinformatic approach to search the pspG promoter region for the control elements that are present in the psp operon promoter, which are binding sites for σ54, PspF, and IHF. Using the program fuzzpro (EMBOSS programs) and the consensus sequence WWWTCAA[N4]TTR for IHF binding (45Hales L.M. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and sequences GGCACGCAAATTGT for σ54 binding and TAGTGTAATTCGCTAACT for PspF binding (based on the σ54 and PspF binding sites in the pspA promoter) (20Jovanovic G. Model P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 46Dworkin J. Jovanovic G. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) we found potential binding sites for σ54, IHF, and PspF (Fig. 4). Using the translational fusion for pspG (pLL1) we found that σ54-RNAP and activation by PspF are required in vivo for pIV-induced PspG expression. In the wild type strains the basal level of PspG expression is extremely low, but is up-regulated upon induction with pIV. In mutant strains for σ54 and PspF, pspG expression is abolished both before and after"

We have investigated the importance of these receptors in the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and macrophage resistance to infection with Coxiella burnetii, an obligate intracellular bacterium and the etiological agent of Q fever. By using a Chinese hamster ovary/CD14 cell line expressing either functional TLR2 or TLR4, we determined that C. burnetii phase II activates TLR2 but not TLR4. Macrophages deficient for TLR2, but not TLR4, produced less tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-12 upon C. burnetii infection. Furthermore, it was found that TLR2 activation interfered with C. burnetii intracellular replication, as macrophages from TLR2-deficient mice were highly permissive for C. burnetii growth compared with macrophages from wild type mice or TLR4-deficient mice. Although LPS modifications distinguish virulent C. burnetii phase I bacteria from avirulent phase II organisms, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis showed that the lipid A moieties isolated from these two phase variants are identical. Purified lipid A derived from either phase I or phase II LPS failed to activate TLR2 and TLR4. Indeed, the lipid A molecules were able to interfere with TLR4 signaling in response to purified Escherichia coli LPS. These studies indicate that TLR2 is an important host determinant that mediates recognition of C. burnetii and a response that limits growth of this intracellular pathogen.

Two phase variants of C. burnetii have been described, the highly virulent phase I and the avirulent phase II. Avirulent phase II C. burnetii can be obtained by multiple passages through chicken cells. Although avirulent for mammals, phase II organisms effectively infect and grow in cultured host cells (1Baca O.G. Li Y.P. Kumar H. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 476-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Maurin M. Benoliel A.M. Bongrand P. Raoult D. Infect.

C. burnetii phase II, Nine Mile strain clone 4, contains a 26-kb deletion in the genome, which codes for a group of lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic genes (6Hoover T.A. Culp D.W. Vodkin M.H. Williams J.C. Thompson H.A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6726-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a feature that provides genetic support for the reported differences in the composition of LPS from C. burnetii phase I and II (7Amano K. Williams J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 994-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schramek S. Mayer H. Infect. Immun. 1982; 38: 53-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. burnetii phase I is the etiological agent of Q fever, a disease of worldwide distribution (9Maurin M. Raoult D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 14: 518-553Crossref Google Scholar, 10Norlander L.

Because of its ability to survive in the environment and high infectivity when aerosolized, C. burnetii is classified as a category B bioterrorism agent (12Seshadri R. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A.

Dis. 2004; 17: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The disease manifests either as an acute or chronic illness with symptoms such as debilitating headache and cyclic fever (9Maurin M. Raoult D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 14: 518-553Crossref Google Scholar). Acute Q fever is usually self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts, whereas the chronic form of the disease develops in individuals defective in cell-mediated immunity (9Maurin M. Raoult D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 14: 518-553Crossref Google Scholar, 13Marrie T.J. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2004; 17: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These findings support the fundamental role of an effective innate immune recognition to the host resistance against C. burnetii. The innate immune system has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to sense invading microbes, to discriminate between different pathogens, and to initiate the production and secretion of inflammatory molecules that contribute to the development of an acquired immune response and host resistance to infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) constitute a family of pattern recognition molecules that can respond to molecular structures conserved in many microbial products. These transmembrane receptors contain ectodomains that have leucine-rich repeats that are involved in pattern recognition and intracellular signaling domains that initiate cellular responses to microbial products (14Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5994) Google Scholar, 15Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4655) Google Scholar). To date, 11 functional TLRs have been described (TLR1–11). Many TLRs have the ability to respond to bacterial products (15Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4655) Google Scholar, 16Akira S. Curr. Opin.

Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). TLR2 appears to be the most promiscuous, responding to multiple bacterial products, including lipoproteins, lipopeptides, lipoteichoic acid, and peptidoglycans (14Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (5994) Google Scholar, 15Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1999; 285: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). In contrast, TLR4 is specifically activated by the lipid A moiety of LPS from Gram-negative bacteria (19Beutler B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, the ability of TLR4 to respond to LPS is not universal. LPS molecules from bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Leptospira interrogans, Legionella pneumophila, and Rhizobium species fail to activate TLR4; however, there is evidence to suggest that these bacteria activate host cells through a TLR2-dependent mechanism (20Darveau R.P. Pham T.T. Lemley K. Reife R.A. Bainbridge B.W. Coats S.R. Howald W.N. Way S.S. Hajjar A.M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5041-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 21Girard R. Pedron T.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). It is not clear if LPS from C. burnetii can activate TLR-dependent signaling pathways. Recently, Honstettre and colleagues (24Honstettre A. Ghigo E. Moynault A. Capo C. Toman R. Akira S. Takeuchi O. Lepidi H. Raoult D. Mege J.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) showed that C. burnetii are internalized by macrophages from TLR4–/– mice less efficiently and that infected TLR4-deficient mice have a defect in granuloma formation and cytokine production. However, TLR4–/– mice and macrophages were as effective at controlling infections by C. burnetii as wild type mice (24Honstettre A. Ghigo E. Moynault A. Capo C. Toman R. Akira S. Takeuchi O. Lepidi H. Raoult D. Mege J.L. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3695-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, compared with LPS from enteric bacteria, C. burnetii LPS has been shown to be a weak endotoxin (25Williams J.C. Waag D.M. Williams J.C. Thompson H.A. The Biology of Coxiella burnetii. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 175-222Google Scholar, 26Toman R. Garidel P. Andra J. Slaba K. Hussein A. Koch M.H. Brandenburg K. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine mechanisms that underlie host recognition of C. burnetii, TLR2- and TLR4-dependent responses to C. burnetii were investigated. By using CHO/CD14 reporter cell lines stably transfected with either TLR2 or TLR4, it was determined that highly purified C. burnetii lipid A is a weak agonist of both TLR2 and TLR4. Purified lipid A from C. burnetii was found to be an antagonist of TLR4, inhibiting responses to purified Escherichia coli LPS. Live C. burnetii triggered TLR2 activation, a feature required for induction of inflammatory cytokines and macrophage resistance to C. burnetii infection. Finally, by mass spectrometry we show that highly purified lipid A from phase I and II LPS display the same ionic species and fragmentation profiles, supporting the idea they have very similar if not identical structures. These data suggest an important role for TLR2 in the host response to C. burnetii and a potentially immunosuppressive activity for TLR4 associated with C. burnetii lipid A. Bacterial Preparation to Cellular Studies—Infective inocula of C. burnetii phase II Nine Mile strain clone 4 (RSA439) were prepared as described (27Zamboni D.S. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) from confluent Vero cells infected with C. burnetii for 7 days. Prior to infection, suspensions containing about 109 infective bacteria per ml were mildly sonicated at 35 kHz for 15 min at room temperature. Except for cytokine determination, macrophages were infected with ∼100 infective organisms per cell. After 24 h, infected cultures were vigorously washed with Hanks' saline solution, and the appropriate fresh medium was added. LPS and Lipid A Extraction—C. burnetii Nine Mile strain phase I clone 7 (RSA493) was grown in Spf embryonated chicken eggs purified as described (28Samuel J.E. Frazier M.E. Mallavia L.P. Infect. Immun. 1985; 49: 775-779Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Nine Mile strain phase II (RSA439) was cultured and purified from persistently infected Vero cells as described (27Zamboni D.S. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). LPS was preliminarily purified with hot phenol (29Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) or, alternatively, by a procedure that involves extensive delipidation followed by butanolic water extraction, previously used for extraction of glycolipoproteins and glycolipids from protozoan parasites (30Almeida I.C. Camargo M.M. Procopio D.O. Silva L.S. Mehlert A. Travassos L.R. Gazzinelli R.T. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1476-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This latter procedure resulted in an LPS less contaminated with other bacterial components. Briefly, inactivated bacteria were lyophilized and sequentially extracted (three times each) with 10 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2, v/v, respectively) and chloroform/methanol/water (10:20:8, v/v/v). Delipidated pellet was then re-extracted (three times) with 10 volumes of 9% 1-butanol, for 4 h at room temperature, under constant shaking. Butanol extracts were grouped and dried using a rotatory evaporator (Büchi, Switzerland), dissolved in endotoxin-free deionized water, and filtered through a 0.2-μm polytrifluoroethylene filter disk. Final purity of the LPS was determined by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, subsequently silver-stained as described previously (22Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C. Qureshi N. Michalek S.M. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 1477-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The lipid A moiety was isolated from LPS of phases I and II after mild acid hydrolysis with 0.25 n HCl (prepared from sequencing grade 6 n HCl) for 1 h at 100 °C, followed by neutralization with 0.25 n NaOH and Folch's partition (31Folch J. Lees M. Stanley G.H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid A was recovered in the lower phase, dried under N2, and redissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and quantified by estimating the inorganic phosphate content (32Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2853) Google Scholar). CHO Cell Lines and Flow Cytometry Analysis—The CHO reporter cell lines (CHO/CD14, expressing functional TLR4; 7.19/CD14/TLR-2, expressing TLR2; and the 7.19 clone, expressing neither TLR2 nor functional MD2) were generated as described (33Lien E.

These cell lines expressing TLRs contain the CD25 gene under the control of E-selectin promoter, which contains an NF-κB-binding site. Thus, CD25 expression is dependent upon NF-κB activation (33Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol.

Cells were plated (1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture dishes), cultured for 24 h, and stimulated with live C. burnetii phase II at a ratio of 10, 100, or 1000 bacteria per cell; 10, 100, 1000, or 10000 ng/ml of purified LPS; or 82 nmol (in regard to inorganic phosphate content) of purified lipid A (about 200 ng/ml). Controls included UV-killed E. coli (HB101) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12692), and LPS and lipid A extracted from E. coli and Bordetella pertussis. After 18 h stimulation, cells were stained with (R)-phycoerythrin-labeled anti-CD25 (mouse monoclonal antibody to human CD25, (R)-phycoerythrin conjugate; CALTAG Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) 1:200 and examined by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) as described previously (35Campos M.A. Almeida I.C. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Paganini E. Procopio D.O. Travassos L.R. Smith J.A. Golenbock D.T. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Mice and Primary Macrophages Culture—TLR4 mutant (C3H/HeJ) and control (C3H/HePas) mice were purchased from the University of São Paulo (Brazil), and TLR2-null mice were provided by Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan) and backcrossed 8 times to C57BL/6 to ensure similar genetic backgrounds. C57BL/6, used as control mice, were obtained from CEDEME/UNIFESP (São Paulo, Brazil). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated as described (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) from 6- to 8-week-old mice. Differentiated macrophages were counted and seeded (2 × 105) in either 96-well tissue culture plates (for cytokine determination) or 24-well tissue culture plates containing a glass coverslip (for infection studies). Cultures were kept at 36 °C in a 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum and 5% of conditioned medium derived from cultures of L929 cells. Human PBMC were isolated from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Paque gradient centrifugation as described (37Golenbock D.T. Hampton R.Y. Qureshi N. Takayama K. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19490-19498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were resuspended in complete RPMI supplemented with fetal bovine serum and plated (1 × 105 cells/well) in 96-well plates. Production of IL-12/TNF-α by Infected Macrophages—PBMC were cultured and stimulated in 96-well tissue culture plates with C. burnetii phase I lipid A (0.1, 1, or 10 μg/ml), doubly extracted LPS from E. coli strain O111:B4 (0.1, 1, or 10 ng/ml), PMA (30 ng/ml), and/or E5564 molecule (1 μg/ml). Supernatants were harvested for TNF-α determination 18 h after stimulation. Murine macrophages were infected in 96-well tissue culture plates at a multiplicity of 10, 100, or 500 bacteria per cell (in a final volume of 200 μl/well) in the presence or absence of 50 units/ml of IFN-γ (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Aliquots of the supernatant were collected 24 and 48 h after infection, respectively, for the determination of the presence of TNF-α and IL-12 (p40). Cytokines were measured by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Duoset; R & D Systems). Determination of C. burnetii Viability and Percentage of Cells with LRVs—The viability of C. burnetii was determined as described previously (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, infected macrophages were submitted to hypotonic lysis with H2O, a step that did not reduce the bacterial infectivity. Lysates were sonicated, diluted, and then used to infect monolayers of γ-irradiated (1000 rads) Vero cells to block cell multiplication. Irradiated Vero cells were cultured as described (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and fixed/stained by DAPI 4 days after infection. An epifluorescence microscope equipped with a ×40 objective was used to score the percentage of infected cells. Dilutions chosen for counting contained in the range of 10–50% infected cells. The percentage of cells with LRVs was determined as described (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using a ×40 objective in an inverted microscope to score the presence or absence of large C. burnetii vacuoles. Approximately 500 cells in each of triplicate coverslips were scored for either LRV formation or viability determination. Confocal Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and Determination of C. burnetii Load in LRVs—Images of fixed and DAPI-stained cells (stained for 15 min with 3.5 μm DAPI) were acquired in a Bio-Rad 1024UV confocal system as described (27Zamboni D.S. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) version 3.5 was used for image processing. Polygons were drawn onto digitized images of infected cells, and the relative fluorescence intensity of DAPI-stained bacteria within the circumscribed areas was determined. Under the measurement conditions used, it was shown that the fluorescence intensity within each polygon is proportional to the bacterial load in the region measured (27Zamboni D.S. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Between 60 and 90 vacuoles were measured in each of triplicate coverslips. Electrospray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry—Lipid A species were analyzed using an electrospray ionization-ion trap-mass spectrometer (ESI-MS) (LCQ-Duo, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Samples were diluted in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), containing 10 mm ammonium acetate (CM/AA), and introduced into the electrospray source through a fused silica capillary (50-μm internal diameter), using a microinfusion pump (Harvard Apparatus) at a flow rate of 5–10 μl/min, or through a 20-μl loop of the ESI-MS instrument with the assistance of a solvent delivery system (Omnifit, UK) containing CM/AA and pressurized with N2 (9–10 pounds/square inch). Spectra were collected in negative ion mode, using an ion source voltage of 4.2 kV and capillary voltage and temperature of 35–45 V and 200 °C, respectively. Full scans were acquired at a rate of 3 scans/s, over the mass range of 200–2000 m/z. Fragmentation analysis (ESI-MS/MS) was carried out using a relative collision energy of 20–40% (1–2 eV). Authentic lipid A preparations from E. coli and Salmonella minnesota (Sigma) were used to calibrate instrument parameters in both ESI-MS and ESI-MS/MS modes. C. burnetii Phase II Bacteria Activate TLR2 but Not TLR4 — CHO/CD14 reporter cell lines expressing either human TLR2 or TLR4 were stimulated for 18 h with live C. burnetii phase II at a ratio of 10, 100, and 1000 bacteria per cell. Controls included UV-killed S. aureus and E. coli. The former is known to activate only TLR2, whereas the latter contains components that activate both TLR2 (such as lipopeptides and peptidoglycan) and TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide) (38Lee H.K. Lee J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4012-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 39Muroi M. Ohnishi T. Azumi-Mayuzumi S. Tanamoto K. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3221-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation was assessed by measuring the expression of surface CD25 by flow cytometry (33Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3001-3009PubMed Google Scholar). No induction of CD25 expression was observed when cells expressing TLR4 were exposed to C. burnetii phase II. In contrast, induction of CD25 expression by TLR2-expressing cells was observed. These data indicate that live C. burnetii can activate TLR2 but not TLR4 (Fig. 1). TLR2 Is Important for the Production of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines by C. burnetii-infected Murine Macrophages—The experiments with CHO reporter cell lines suggested that C. burnetii stimulates TLR2 but not TLR4. To determine whether TLR2 is important for host recognition, macrophages from mice deficient for TLR2 (TLR2–/–) or TLR4 (C3H/HeJ) were infected with phase II C. burnetii, and the detection of bacteria by host cells was assessed by cytokine production. Macrophages from C3H/HePas and C3H/HeJ both produced high levels of TNF-α and IL-12p40 after C. burnetii infection (Fig. 2). In contrast, macrophages from TLR2–/– mice were severely defective in cytokine production when compared with macrophages from wild type mice (Fig. 2). Additionally, treating macrophages with IFN-γ before infection enhanced TNF-α and IL-12 production by wild type and TLR4-deficient macrophages but not by TLR2-deficient macrophages (Fig. 2, B and D). These findings indicate that TLR2 is required for the signaling pathway leading to production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages exposed to phase II C. burnetii and further suggest that TLR4 is not responding to C. burnetii. TLR2 Responses Limit Growth of C. burnetii in Murine Macrophages—To determine the contribution of TLR2 or TLR4 on host cell defense, macrophages from C3H/HeJ, C3H/HePas, TLR2–/–, and wild type (C57BL/6) mice were infected with C. burnetii phase II and monitored for 8 days after infection. Bacterial replication was determined by measuring focus-forming units over time. Fig. 3A shows that C. burnetii multiplication in TLR4-deficient macrophages was similar to that observed in control macrophages that produce functional TLR4. By contrast, TLR2-deficient macrophages were found to be highly susceptible to C. burnetii multiplication. We have demonstrated previously that murine macrophages have the ability to control the development of the LRVs in which C. burnetii multiplies (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 40Zamboni D.S. Freymuller E. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Bacterial multiplication correlates with LRV formation (36Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 41Zamboni D.S. Rabinovitch M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Zamboni D.S. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2395-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, TLR2-deficient macrophages were examined to determine whether they contained a greater number of LRVs compared with control macrophages. Fig. 3B shows that macrophages from TLR2–/– mice had more LRVs than control macrophages infected in parallel. After 2 days of infection, more than 50% of the TLR2–/– macrophages contained LRVs, while less than 25% of the macrophages from C57BL/6 or C3H/HeJ or C3H/HePas displayed LRVs at this time. To investigate whether LRVs found in TLR2-deficient macrophages contained more C. burnetii cells, intravacuolar bacterial loads were measured using quantitative fluorescence in digital images of DAPI-stained cells (27Zamboni D.S. Mortara R.A. Rabinovitch M. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 43: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 3C shows that DAPI fluorescence of LRVs in macrophages from C3H/HePas mice did not differ from that found in TLR4-deficient macrophages. However, the DAPI intensities for LRVs found in macrophages deficient in TLR2 were significantly higher than those of LRVs from wild type macrophages (Fig. 3C). Fig. 3D shows representative fields of macrophage cultures infected for 4 days with C. burnetii phase II. Several macrophages from TLR2–/– mice display LRVs, whereas only a few macrophages from C57BL/6 mice developed these organelles. The images shown in Fig. 3D also highlight the higher bacterial load found in vacuoles formed in macrophages deficient in TLR2, as compared with wild type macrophages. Overall, these results show that wild type macrophages were more effective than TLR2-d"

IscU behaves as a substrate for HscA, and HscB enhances the binding of IscU to HscA. To better understand the mechanism by which HscB and IscU regulate HscA, we examined binding of HscB to the different conformational states of HscA and the effects of HscB and IscU on the kinetics of the individual steps of the HscA ATPase reaction cycle. Affinity sensor studies revealed that whereas IscU binds both ADP (R-state) and ATP (T-state) HscA complexes, HscB interacts only with an ATP-bound state. Studies of ATPase activity under single-turnover and rapid mixing conditions showed that both IscU and HscB interact with the low peptide affinity T-state of HscA (HscA‡·ATP) and that both modestly accelerate (3–10-fold) the rate-determining steps in the HscA reaction cycle, khyd and kT→R. When present together, IscU and HscB synergistically stimulate both khyd (≅500-fold) and kT→R (≅60-fold), leading to enhanced formation of the HscA·ADP-IscU complex (substrate capture). Following ADP/ATP exchange, IscU also stimulates kR→T (≅50-fold) and thereby accelerates the rate at which the low peptide affinity HscA‡·ATP T-state is regenerated. Because HscA nucleotide exchange is fast, the overall rate of the chaperone cycle in vivo will be determined by the availability of the IscU-HscB substrate-co-chaperone complex.

HscA (heat shock cognate 66-kDa; Hsc66) is a specialized member of the hsp70 family of molecular chaperones that functions in the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur proteins. The biochemical properties of HscA, including slow intrinsic ATPase activity and nucleotide-dependent peptide binding (1Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Silberg J.J.

HscA interacts selectively with IscU, a 14-kDa protein proposed to serve as a scaffold for de novo assembly of Fe-S clusters (4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and may function to regulate Fe-S cluster formation and/or transfer to acceptor proteins. HscA recognizes a specific LPPVK sequence motif at positions 99–103 of IscU and is able to bind synthetic peptides containing this sequence (6Hoff K.G. Ta D.T. Tapley T.L. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E.

The crystal structure of the HscA substrate binding domain complexed with the peptide ELPPVKIHC was recently determined (9Cupp-Vickery J. Peterson J.C. Ta D.T. Vickery L.E. J. Mol. Biol.,. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar) and revealed that the peptide binds with the opposite orientation of that observed for DnaK peptide complexes (10Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The interaction of IscU with HscA is regulated by the specialized J-type co-chaperone HscB (heat shock cognate 20-kDa; Hsc20), which escorts IscU substrate to the chaperone and enhances its binding affinity (4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism whereby HscB enhances HscA and IscU binding is not known but appears to involve coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis with conformational changes that regulate substrate affinity. ATP binding to HscA leads to formation of a tense state (T) with reduced substrate affinity, and subsequent hydrolysis to ADP and phosphate results in a relaxed state (R) with increased substrate affinity (2Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In an earlier study we characterized the kinetics of the individual steps of the HscA ATPase reaction cycle in the absence of auxiliary proteins to determine the intrinsic rates of conversion of HscA between its different substrate affinity states (Scheme 1) (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HscA was found to bind ATP in a two-step process preceding ATP hydrolysis. The first step was binding of HscA and ATP, and the second was interpreted as a conformational change involving conversion of HscA from the R- to the T-state (HscA·ATP → HscA‡·ATP). ATP hydrolysis occurs in the T-state, and this is followed by a conformational change that returns HscA to the R-state. ATP hydrolysis and the subsequent conformational relaxation are rate-limiting in the overall cycle and are >103-fold slower than release of the products ADP and phosphate. Thus, in contrast to other hsp70 isoforms that are regulated at both ATP hydrolysis and ADP/ATP exchange (12Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), regulation of the HscA reaction cycle is expected to occur solely at the rate-determining hydrolysis step. The interconversion of HscA between its different conformational states is regulated by HscB and IscU, but the effects HscB and IscU have on different kinetic steps of the HscA ATPase cycle have not been investigated. Individually, HscB and IscU weakly stimulate HscA steady-state ATPase activity (maximal stimulation <10-fold), but together they synergistically stimulate HscA activity >400-fold (1Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, HscB reduces the concentration of IscU required for half-maximal stimulation of HscA steady-state activity ∼20-fold (4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Regulation of HscA ATPase and IscU binding activity may occur in a manner similar to that suggested for DnaK. The ATPase activity of DnaK is regulated by the hsp40-type co-chaperone DnaJ, and DnaJ is proposed to mediate DnaK substrate specificity by targeting peptides to the low affinity T-state of DnaK and enhancing the rate of ATP hydrolysis (13Misselwitz B.

This synergistic stimulation is thought to result in conversion of DnaK to a high affinity conformational state that stabilizes the DnaK-substrate complex (13Misselwitz B. Staeck O. Rapoport T.A.

Apart from the J-domain, however, HscB and DnaJ differ considerably and may have different regulatory actions. The C-terminal region of HscB consists of a compact three-helix bundle (24Cupp-Vickery J.R. Vickery L.E. J. Mol.

In addition, HscB does not exhibit intrinsic chaperone activity (2Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J.

To better understand the regulation of HscA by HscB and IscU, we have used a combination of affinity sensor, steady-state ATPase, single-turnover ATPase, and pre-steady-state stopped-flow kinetic measurements to examine their effects on HscA catalytic activity and nucleotide interactions. Materials—Escherichia coli DH5αF′IQ cells were from Invitrogen; bacterial growth media components were from Difco; and other reagents were from Sigma. Recombinant HscA, HscB, and IscU were expressed and purified as described previously (1Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Some purified preparations of HscB were found to contain small amounts of IscU that affected HscA ATPase activity; HscB samples were therefore passed over a column containing immobilized antiserum to IscU to remove contaminating IscU protein prior to kinetic analyses. Steady-state ATPase Assays—ATPase rates were determined at 23 °C in HKM buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) by measuring phosphate release using either a colorimetric assay as described by Lanzetta et al. (30Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar) or a coupled enzyme assay (EnzCheck phosphate assay kit, Molecular Probes) (31Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Control experiments showed that the rate of phosphate detection was faster than that of ATP hydrolysis by HscA under all conditions described. Each reaction was incubated at 23 °C for 5 min prior to initiating the hydrolysis reaction by addition of ATP. The rate of hydrolysis (Vo) was determined by linear regression analysis, and the fraction of ATP hydrolyzed was not allowed to exceed 20%. Km and Vmax values were determined by fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to a plot of Vo versus [ATP]free using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software). The preparation of HscA used in this study exhibited a slightly lower Km value for ATP (∼8.6 μm) compared with previous reports (12.7 μm; cf. Ref. 11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HscB and IscU alone did not exhibit detectable ATPase activity. Single-turnover ATPase Assays—Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained HKM buffer, 150 μm HscA, 150 μm ATP (containing 0.1–1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP; Amersham Biosciences), and 150 μm HscB or 150 μm IscU where indicated. For reactions containing HscB or IscU, the assay was initiated by the addition of ATP to a mixture of HscA and HscB or IscU, or by preincubating HscA with ATP for 1 min (during which time <5% of the ATP is hydrolyzed) and initiating the reaction by addition of HscB or IscU. Aliquots of the reaction mixture (5 μl) were removed at various times after initiating reactions and quenched by adding 10 μl of acetonitrile (Fisher). The sample was mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 30 s, and 2 μl was spotted on polyethylene-cellulose TLC sheets (Supelco). TLC sheets were dried and developed in 1 m formic acid containing 0.5 m LiCl. The fraction of ADP present was determined using a PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Data were corrected for the background level of [α-32P]ADP (typically ∼2%) and an unknown impurity (typically ∼2%) that migrates farther than ADP on TLC. For those experiments in which HscB and IscU were added subsequent to ATP, the data were further corrected for the hydrolysis that occurred prior to addition. ATP-induced Spectral Changes—Difference absorbance spectra were recorded using a Cary 1 spectrophotometer (Varian). Reactions containing HKM buffer and indicated levels of HscA, HscB, and IscU were incubated at 23 °C for 5 min prior to initiating reactions by adding ATP. For kinetic measurements, reactions were monitored at 280 or 288 nm using a cuvette with a 1-mm path length. No spectral changes were observed upon mixing HscB or IscU with ATP. ATP Binding Kinetics—Rapid kinetic measurements were performed as before (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using a stopped-flow UV-visible spectrophotometer (HiTech, UK). Assays were carried out in HKM buffer containing 0–500 μm ATP and indicated levels of HscA, HscB, and IscU. Experiments were initiated by mixing equal volumes of protein and nucleotide solutions that had been incubated at 23 °C for 5 min. Absorbance changes were monitored at 280 or 288 nm, and experiments were repeated at least six times at each ATP concentration. The concentrations of proteins and nucleotides shown in the figures are final concentrations in the optical cell after mixing. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—A Microcal Omega titration calorimeter (Microcal, Inc.) was used to investigate the binding of HscA and ADP at 25 °C using procedures described previously (4Hoff K.G. Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—SPR 1The abbreviations used are: SPR, surface plasmon resonance; RU, response units. methods were carried out at 25 °C with a Biacore 3000 instrument (Piscataway, NJ) using methods described previously (3Silberg J.J.

HscB or HscA was randomly cross-linked to the surface of the sensor chip using amine coupling as recommended by the manufacturer. Analyte was injected over the sensor chip in HKM buffer containing either 1 mm ADP, ATP, or ADP and Pi. Data are reported as changes in maximal relative response (response units (RU)) versus concentration of analyte injected. Samples containing ATP were mixed immediately before injecting to prevent significant hydrolysis of ATP. The percentage of bound ligand was calculated using the Equation 1,% bound=100⋅(RUanalyte/Mr analyte)/(RUbound ligand/Mr bound ligand) (Eq. 1) where RUanalyte is the maximum response upon injection of the analyte; RUbound ligand is the amount of immobilized protein; and Mr analyte and Mr bound ligand are the molecular masses of the respective proteins used in the experiment. Error Analysis—Kinetic values are reported ±1 S.D. resulting from the fit to the data, with propagation of error through any subsequent calculations. Rate constants requiring a fit of kobs (i.e. ka and kd for ATP) are reported as ±1 S.D. from the secondary fit, using all available values of kobs. Error bars are only shown in figures if 1 S.D. is greater than the symbol used. Effects of HscB and IscU on khyd—To investigate whether khyd contributes to the overall reaction rate in the presence of substrate and co-chaperone, we measured IscU and HscB effects on HscA activity under single-turnover hydrolysis conditions by monitoring the production of [α-32P]ADP from [α-32P]ATP. Experiments were performed using limiting [α-32P]ATP and high concentrations of HscA to ensure that most of the nucleotide would be bound rapidly compared with the rate of hydrolysis. For these experiments, we used levels of HscB (150 μm) and IscU (150 μm) several fold higher than their apparent affinities as determined previously in steady-state ATPase assays (KmHscB=5−12 μM and KmIscU=2/34 μM in the presence/absence of HscB; cf. Refs. 1Vickery L.E. Silberg J.J. Ta D.T. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Vickery L.E. J.

A. 2000; 97: 7790-7795Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, A–C, shows the time course of ATP hydrolysis at 23 °C in the absence and presence of HscB and IscU (filled symbols). Previous studies showed that ATP hydrolysis by HscA is essentially irreversible (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the data are fit to a first order rate equation (Equation 2).[ADP]t=[ADP]∞⋅(1−e−khyd⋅t)(Eq. 2) The rates of hydrolysis (khyd) observed in the presence of HscB (0.020 s–1) and IscU (0.006 s–1) were 10- and 3-fold greater, respectively, than observed for HscA alone (khyd = 0.002 s–1). The insets in Fig. 1, A–C, show that steady-state assays performed under identical conditions, i.e. using high levels of co-chaperone and substrate, yielded similar rates suggesting ATP hydrolysis remains rate-limiting in the presence of either HscB or IscU. Studies by others have shown that the order of addition of ATP and co-chaperones can complicate measurement of khyd. Russell et al. (14Russell R. Wali Karzai A. Mehl A.F. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4165-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found that a kinetic step prior to ATP hydrolysis (e.g. a first order ATP-induced conformational change) can be rate-limiting when single-turnover experiments are performed by adding ATP to a mixture of DnaK and DnaJ. It is thus possible that the rate we observed for single-turnover experiments in which ATP was added to a mixture of HscA and HscB or HscA and IscU may not represent the actual rate of ATP hydrolysis. For this reason additional experiments were carried out in which HscA was preincubated for 1 min with limiting ATP prior to addition of HscB or IscU in order to allow for formation of low peptide affinity T-state (HscA‡·ATP). The open symbols in Fig. 1, B and C, show that HscB and IscU stimulate HscA single-turnover hydrolysis activity to a similar extent regardless of the order of addition of ATP. These findings suggest that the rates observed in the presence of HscB or IscU represent rates of ATP hydrolysis. We also investigated the effect of the combination of HscB and IscU on ATPase kinetics. When saturating levels of both auxiliary proteins were used in single-turnover experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 1, A–C, we found that >95% of the ATP was hydrolyzed at the first time point that could be acquired after initiating the reaction (∼5 s; data not shown). For this reason we instead carried out steady-state ATPase measurements to assess the effect of addition of both substrate and co-chaperone. Fig. 1D shows that addition of a combination of IscU and HscB causes a dramatic stimulation of HscA ATPase activity. The actual rate of ATP hydrolysis, khyd, must be equal to or greater than the steady-state rate observed, kcat = 1.14 s–1. Thus HscB and IscU together stimulate khyd to a much greater level (≅500-fold) than the sum of their individual stimulations (13-fold), indicating that HscB and IscU have a synergistic effect on khyd. Conversion of HscA from the R- to the T-state (kR→T) must also be stimulated by HscB and/or IscU because this kinetic step is only 70-fold faster than the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of auxiliary proteins (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether khyd remains rate-limiting in the presence of HscB and IscU because other kinetic steps may be subject to regulation. HscB Binds HscA‡·ATP and Stimulates kT→R—Previous studies have shown that J-type auxiliary co-chaperones typically interact only with the ATP-bound T-state of their cognate hsp70 (27Wawrzynow A.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HscB binds to a unique nucleotide state of HscA, we examined ATP and ADP effects on the interactions of HscA and HscB by using SPR. In initial experiments, HscA was cross-linked to the surface of a sensor chip and exposed to HscB in the presence of either ATP or ADP. Fig. 2A shows that HscB binds immobilized HscA in the presence of ATP, and based on the strength of the signal observed, we estimated that ∼22% of the immobilized HscA binds HscB by assuming formation of a 1:1 complex. In the presence of ADP, a much weaker signal was observed (∼1% binding), suggesting that HscB interacts weakly if at all with the ADP complex of HscA. A similar lack of binding was observed in separate experiments carried out in the presence of 1 mm ADP and 1 mm phosphate or in the absence of nucleotide (data not shown). Because immobilization of HscA could inhibit the ability of the ADP-bound form of HscA to interact with HscB, SPR binding experiments were also carried out using immobilized HscB and exposure to soluble HscA (Fig. 2B). Again, binding of HscB and HscA was only observed in the presence of ATP, and no significant interaction was observed in the presence of ADP. These results indicate that HscB only binds with high affinity to the low peptide affinity T-state (HscA‡·ATP; cf. Scheme 1). The finding that HscB binds to the HscA·ATP complex suggested that HscB could regulate the kinetics of ATP binding and/or the R⇔T conversion. To determine whether HscB affects these steps, we made use of an ATP-induced spectral change in HscA. ATP binding to HscA gives rise to a transient shift in the near-UV absorption spectrum of HscA that can be used to monitor the rates of ATP binding and the R→T conversion, and decay of the absorbance change can be used to monitor ATP hydrolysis and subsequent T→R conversion (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7779-7786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HscB affects the binding kinetics of HscA and ATP, we compared the rate of formation of the ATP-induced difference absorbance spectrum in the absence and presence of HscB by using stopped-flow methods. Our earlier stopped-flow experiments showed that HscA binds ATP in a two-step process as evidenced by a rapid, biphasic ATP-induced change in HscA absorbance (11Silberg J.J. Vickery L.E."

A more profound defect in osteoclastogenesis was observed in vitro using IKKα-/- hematopoietic cells treated with colony-stimulating factor 1 and RANK ligand (RANKL), as the cells failed to form large, multinucleated osteoclasts. Additionally, overall RANKL-induced global gene expression was significantly blunted in IKKα-/- cells, including osteoclast-specific genes such as TRAP, MMP-9, and c-Src. IKKα was not required for RANKL-mediated IκBα degradation or phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases but was required for RANKL-induced p100 processing. Treatment of IKKα-/- cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) in combination with RANKL led to partial rescue of osteoclastogenesis despite a lack of p100 processing.

Skeletal mass homeostasis is maintained by the coupled activities of bone-building osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Dysregulation of osteoclast differentiation or function underlies many diseases affecting the skeletal system, including osteoporosis, joint inflammation, tumor metastasis to bone, and Paget disease (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4988) Google Scholar).

Genetic studies in mice, as well as in vitro culture of osteoclasts using CSF-1 and RANKL, have elucidated many key components of RANK signaling during osteoclastogenesis. Binding of RANKL to RANK stimulates recruitment of TRAF2, -5, and -6 (6Galibert L. Tometsko M.E. Anderson D.M. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The contribution of other signaling components to RANK-mediated osteoclastogenesis remains unclear because ablation of many of these genes, such as the NF-κB family member p65, TRAF2, and IKKβ, results in embryonic or neonatal lethality (10Beg A.A.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Additionally, although cytokines that contribute to osteoclast differentiation during inflammation, such as TNFα and interleukin 1, can activate NF-κB and AP-1 (13Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E.

Nishihara T. Takahashi N. Suda T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 434-442PubMed Google Scholar) in osteoclast precursor cells, RANK and RANKL remain essential for osteoclastogenesis in vivo. For instance, administering osteoprotegerin to rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis abrogates osteoclastogenesis and subsequent bone loss without inhibiting inflammation (15Kong Y.Y. Feige U. Sarosi I. Bolon B. Tafuri A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Li J. Elliott R. McCabe S. Wong T. Campagnuolo G. Moran E. Bogoch E.R. Van G. Nguyen L.T. Ohashi P.S. Lacey D.L. Fish E. Boyle W.J. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1999; 402: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar). Furthermore, bone erosion induced by overexpression of TNFα in transgenic mice can be alleviated by administering RANK-Fc or by crossing TNFα transgenic mice into a RANK-null background (16Li P. Schwarz E.M. O'Keefe R.J. Ma L. Boyce B.F. Xing L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2004; 19: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that RANK may activate unique signaling pathways in osteoclast progenitor cells. In addition to osteoclast differentiation, RANK signaling is required for mammary gland development during pregnancy (17Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Khokha R. Penninger J.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Female RANK- or RANKL-null mice are unable support live birth because of an inability to lactate. This defect is because of insufficient mammary epithelial cell proliferation during pregnancy as well as an increase in mammary epithelial cell apoptosis, indicating that RANK signaling is required for both the proliferation and survival of mammary epithelial cells that are necessary for the full development of the mammary lobuloalveolar structures during pregnancy. As with osteoclasts, genetic studies in mice have been useful for determining the specific signaling pathways utilized by RANK in the mammary gland. Specifically, mice expressing a kinase-inactive allele of the inhibitor of κB kinase α (IKKαAA) had defects in mammary gland differentiation similar to those in RANK or RANKL-null mice (18Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These defects were linked to a lack of NF-κB activation and subsequent up-regulation of cyclin D1 in mammary epithelial cells. Interestingly, IKKαAA mice had no apparent defects in osteoclast differentiation, indicating that RANK may utilize tissue-specific signaling pathways to activate NF-κB. The transcription factor NF-κB is composed of homo- or heterodimers of the NF-κB family members RelA/p65, RelB, cRel, p50, and p52 (reviewed in Ref. 12Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). The latter two proteins are synthesized as precursors p105 and p100, respectively. Processing of p105 into p50 is constitutively regulated, and p50 is most commonly associated with p65 and the inhibitor protein IκBα in an inactive complex in the cytosol. Activation of the IKK complex containing the catalytic IKKα and -β subunits and the regulatory IKKγ subunit leads to phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα, allowing nuclear translocation of p65/p50. In many cell types, such as fibroblasts or lymphocytes, IKKα kinase activity is dispensable for phosphorylation of IκBα and activation of p65/p50 in response to TNFα or interleukin 1, but it is required for the processing of p100 into p52 in response to stimuli including lymphotoxin β, CD40 ligand, and B cell activating factor. In contrast, IKKα is required for the activation of p65/p50 by RANKL in mammary epithelial cells (18Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The contribution of IKKα to RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis remains unclear, although both p100 processing and p65/p50 nuclear translocation have been implicated as important components of this process (19Novack D.V.

Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To determine whether IKKα plays a role in osteoclast differentiation, we used mice completely lacking IKKα protein (IKKα-/-) (21Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Because these mice die at birth, we examined osteoclast differentiation in vivo in embryonic day 18.5 postcoitus (E18.5 dpc) IKKα-/- embryos and in vitro by culturing IKKα-/- hematopoietic cells with CSF-1 and RANKL. Using this system, we determined that the ability of RANKL to induce the formation of large multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro is impaired in the absence of IKKα. This observation was correlated with a lack of p100 processing into p52. However, adding TNFα to RANKL-treated IKKα-/- cells partially restored osteoclastogenesis despite the presence of accumulated p100. Interestingly, we also observed a partial absence of multinucleated osteoclasts in vivo in IKKα-/- embryos, indicating that a lack of IKKα in osteoclast precursor cells in vivo may be overcome by cooperation between RANKL and other cytokines, such as TNFα. Precursor Cell Analysis and Osteoclast Differentiation Assays— Timed matings were set up for IKKα hemizygous male and female mice as described previously (21Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) to obtain IKKα wild-type and knock-out embryos. Fetal livers were harvested from E18.5 dpc embryos and disrupted to obtain single-cell suspensions in α minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Red blood cells were lysed in lysis solution (Sigma) followed by resuspension in α minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. To determine progenitor cell frequency, cells were plated in Methocult™ medium 3534 containing stem cell factor, interleukin 6, and interleukin 3 (StemCell Technologies, Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) according to the manufacturer's directions, and morphologically distinct GM-CFU colonies were counted for duplicate wells of three separate wild-type and IKKα-/- embryos. For analysis of macrophage lineage markers, fetal liver cells were grown for 6 days in medium containing α minimum Eagle's medium and 40 ng/ml CSF-1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Cells were trypsinized and incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies to CD11b (BD Biosciences) and MOMA-2 (Serotec, Inc., Raleigh, NC) followed by flow cytometric analysis. For osteoclast differentiation assays, cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates in the presence of 40 ng/ml CSF-1 with or without 200 ng/ml recombinant murine RANKL (22Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). Where indicated, cells were also treated with recombinant murine TNFα at 20 ng/ml and/or TGFβ (R&D Systems). Every 48 h, one-half of the cell medium was replaced with medium containing fresh cytokines. Cells were stained after 6 days in culture for TRAP in situ using a commercially available kit (Sigma). For direct analysis of osteoclasts in vivo, E18.5 dpc embryos were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h and decalcified in 10% EDTA for 5 days. Embryos were step-sectioned into 40 sections and stained for TRAP activity. RNA Analysis—RNA was extracted from wild-type and IKKα-/- fetal liver cell cultures after 6 days treatment with CSF-1 and murine RANKL using the RNeasy™ kit (Qiagen). For quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA and used for PCR reactions using specific primers and SYBR Green dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (23Armstrong A.P. Tometsko M.E. Glaccum M. Sutherland C.L. Cosman D. Dougall W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44347-44356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For microarray expression profiling, 5 μg of total RNA from individual samples was labeled according to standard protocols (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and 10 μg of biotinylated cRNA was hybridized to Mouse Affymetrix U430A (MOE430A) chips consisting of ∼22,500 probe sets (Unigene Build 430). Hybridized chips were stained and washed on an Affymetrix FS400 fluidics station using the antibody amplification protocol and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneArray 2500 scanner. Scanned images were loaded into the Resolver™ system (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) for analysis. Western Blots—Cells were grown for 6 days in CSF-1 and treated with murine RANKL for indicated times prior to lysis in 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm NaF. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were stored in aliquots at -70 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA kit (Pierce), and 10 μg of each sample were separated on 8–16% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equivalent loading was confirmed by staining membranes with Ponceau S reagent followed by blocking in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. Primary antibodies were applied in a solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at 4 °C. Horse radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies were applied after washing, which was followed by more washing and then detection using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). IκBα antibody (C-21) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies for phosphorylated proteins and corresponding total proteins were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies. Antibody to mouse p100 was created by injecting rabbits with the NH2-terminal peptide DNCYDPGLDGIPEYDD, as described previously (24Coope H.J. Atkinson P.G. Huhse B. Belich M. Janzen J. Holman M.J. Klaus G.G. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5375-5385Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Defective Osteoclast Differentiation in the Absence of IKKα— IKKα-deficient mice die immediately after birth because of keratinocyte differentiation defects (21Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether IKKα was required for osteoclast differentiation, we analyzed osteoclasts in embryos of IKKα wild-type (+/+ or +/-) and IKKα-null (-/-) littermates at E18.5 dpc. Although similar numbers of cells in both wild-type and knock-out embryos stained positive for the osteoclast marker TRAP (data not shown), the morphology and size of the TRAP+ cells observed in IKKα-/- embryos was dramatically different from those in wild-type littermates (Fig. 1A). In IKKα wild-type embryos, osteoclasts were predominantly multinucleated (57% multinucleated in +/+ and 61% in +/-, Fig. 1B) and contained a highly vacuolated cytoplasm. In contrast, significantly fewer multinucleated TRAP+ cells were identified in IKKα-/- embryos (32%, p < 0.001 compared with +/+, Fig. 1B), and these cells had an altered morphology compared with wild type, often containing a reduced dense granulated cytoplasm. To further characterize the role of IKKα in osteoclastogenesis, we next determined whether IKKα-null fetal liver-derived hematopoietic cells could differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro. Fetal liver cells (FLC) from wild-type or IKKα-/- E18.5 dpc embryos were treated with CSF-1 and RANKL for 6 days and stained for TRAP activity. Treatment of wild-type FLC with CSF-1 and RANKL led to the formation of large multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts (Fig. 2A). However, in IKKα-/- FLC treated with CSF-1 and RANKL, only small TRAP+ cells were observed. The number of multinucleated osteoclasts generated from IKKα-/- FLC was decreased by >15-fold compared with wild type (Fig. 2). To determine whether the lack of osteoclast differentiation observed in IKKα-/- FLC was because of a difference in osteoclast precursor cell numbers, cells were grown in methylcellulose medium containing monocyte/macrophage growth factors, and the frequency of GM-CFU, the earliest defined myeloid progenitor (25Menaa C. Kurihara N. Roodman G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was determined. No differences in GM-CFU frequency were observed between wild-type and IKKα-/- cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that the lack of osteoclast differentiation observed in IKKα-/- FLC is not because of a defect in the myeloid precursor cell compartment. The defect observed in IKKα-/- FLC is specific to osteoclasts but not macrophage, because similar numbers of cells expressing the markers CD11b and MOMA-2 were observed in wild-type and IKKα-/- FLC after 1 week of growth in CSF-1 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results indicate that IKKα is required for RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation from CSF-1-derived precursor cells in vitro.Fig. 3Analysis of macrophage progenitor cell capacity in IKKα-/- fetal liver. A, formation of GM-CFU colonies. Wild-type and IKKα-/- fetal liver cells were plated in methylcellulose medium containing growth factors as described under “Materials and Methods.” Colonies were counted after 2 weeks. B, wild-type and IKKα-/- FLC were grown in CSF-1 for 6 days and then stained with antibodies to macrophage lineage markers CD11b and MOMA-2. The number in the upper right quadrant represents the percent of cells staining positive for both markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Lack of Osteoclast-specific Gene Up-regulation in RANKL-treated IKKα-/- Cells—To further analyze the extent to which RANK-mediated osteoclast differentiation was inhibited in the absence of IKKα, we assessed the expression of osteoclast-specific genes using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4). In wild-type FLC grown in CSF-1 and RANKL for 6 days, expression of Mmp-9, c-Src, TRAP, and β3 integrin was greatly increased compared with cells grown in CSF-1 alone. In contrast, RANKL-induced expression of these genes in IKKα FLC was blunted, with a >16-fold decrease in expression compared with wild type. Importantly, however, expression of RANK was not different between wild-type or IKKα-/- FLC, indicating that loss of RANK expression was not responsible for the lack of response to RANKL in IKKα-/- FLC. To determine whether IKKα was required for a specific subset of RANKL-induced genes or for overall RANKL-induced gene expression, we compared global gene expression in both knock-out and wild-type FLC grown for 6 days in CSF-1 with or without RANKL using an oligonucleotide array representing ∼22,500 mouse genes (Affymetrix). A striking difference was observed in overall RANKL-induced gene expression in IKKα-/- cells compared with wild type. Although 209 genes were up-regulated ≥5-fold (p < 0.001) consistently in duplicate cultures of wild-type FLC treated with CSF-1 and RANKL compared with cells treated with CSF-1 alone (Fig. 5A and supplemental material), only 29 genes were up-regulated ≥5-fold consistently in duplicate cultures of IKKα-/- FLC in response to RANKL. Conversely, 226 genes were down-regulated ≥5-fold in RANKL-treated wild-type FLC, but only three were down-regulated ≥5-fold in RANKL-treated IKKα-/- FLC. The expression patterns of the genes up-regulated >5-fold in wild-type FLC treated with CSF1 and RANKL fall into two broadly even categories in similarly treated IKKα-/- FLC. These categories are a group of genes that show no up-regulation and a group of genes that show “diminished” up-regulation. For example, of the 79 most up-regulated genes in wild-type FLC (>20-fold, p > 0.001), 32 show effectively no up-regulation (with a trend to down-regulation) in IKKα-/- FLC (Fig. 5B), whereas 47 show up-regulation but with diminished magnitude (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results indicate that the overall changes in gene expression induced by RANKL during osteoclast differentiation in vitro are dependent on IKKα. IKKα Is Required for RANK-mediated p100 Processing but Not for Activation of the Classical NF-κB Pathway in CSF-1-derived Precursor Cells—Activation of the NF-κB transcription factor pathway has been shown previously to occur immediately after binding of RANKL to RANK and has been implicated in osteoclast differentiation, activation, and survival (1Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4988) Google Scholar). To determine whether IKKα was required for activation of NF-κB by RANKL in osteoclast precursor cells, we analyzed the ability of RANKL to stimulate degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα in CSF-1-derived wild-type and IKKα-/- FLC. In both wild-type and knock-out cells, RANKL treatment led to the complete degradation of IκBα by 15 min, which was followed by IκBα resynthesis at 30 min (Fig. 6A, top panel). Because IκBα resynthesis is dependent on NF-κB transcription factor activity, these data indicate that IKKα is not required for initial activation of NF-κB by RANKL in osteoclast precursor cells. In addition to the classical NF-κB pathway, RANKL activates a second, or non-canonical, NF-κB activity involving processing of the inhibitory protein p100 into a smaller active p52 subunit. Previous studies have shown that RANKL-mediated p100 processing is dependent on NIK, an upstream activator of IKKα (19Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To directly assess the role of IKKα in RANKL-mediated p100 processing, we analyzed the relative levels of both p100 and p52 in CSF-1-derived wild-type and IKKα-/- FLC treated with RANKL (Fig. 6A, bottom panel). In wild-type cells, p52 accumulation was apparent 8 h after RANKL treatment, whereas p100 levels remained unchanged. However, in IKKα-/- cells, RANKL treatment led to accumulation of p100 without any increase in p52 levels, indicating that IKKα is required for RANKL-mediated p100 processing in osteoclast progenitor cells. Next we analyzed additional signaling pathways activated by RANKL, specifically mitogen-activated protein kinases p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (Fig. 6B). Phosphorylated forms of these proteins were detected 10 min post-RANKL exposure in both wild-type and IKKα-/- cells. Taken together, these data indicate that IKKα is not required for activation of RANKL-activated early signaling pathways involving classical NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases, but is necessary for later RANKL-induced p100 processing. Rescue of RANKL-mediated Osteoclast Differentiation in IKKα-/- Cells by TNFα—IKKα-/- FLC failed to form large, multinucleated osteoclasts in response to RANKL; however, such cells were observed in skeletal sections of IKKα-/- embryos, although there were a reduced number of cells compared with wild-type littermates. The discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo osteoclastogenesis in IKKα-/- cells may be because of the presence of additional factors such as TNFα or TGFβ that can promote RANKL-mediated differentiation (13Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 26Quinn J.M. Itoh K. Udagawa N. Hausler K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Mizuno A. Higashio K. Takahashi N. Suda T. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to determine whether TNFα or TGFβ could affect RANKL signaling (specifically p100 processing) or ultimately osteoclastogenesis in IKKα-/- cells. Neither TNFα nor TGFβ stimulated processing of p100 into p52, either alone or in combination with RANKL in IKKα-/- cells (Fig. 7A). However, TNFα treatment alone, but not TGFβ, led to accumulation of p100 protein (without p52 formation) in IKKα-/- cells, similar to RANKL treatment. In wild-type cells, TNFα treatment increased both p100 and p52 protein levels, in contrast to RANKL treatment, which only increased p52. Taken together, these data indicated a potential role for IKKα during TNFα signaling in osteoclast precursor cells. Consistent with this, we observed that fewer TRAP+ multinucleated cells formed in TNFα-treated IKKα-/- cells compared with those observed in wild-type cells. Furthermore, treatment with TNFα and TGFβ led to the formation of large, multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts in wild-type but not IKKα-/- cells. Interestingly, we found that TNFα in combination with RANKL was able to induce the formation of large, multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts in IKKα-/- FLC, despite the accumulation of p100 and lack of p52 formation following this treatment. The overall number of multinucleated TRAP+ cells observed in IKKα-/- cells treated with RANKL and TNFα was similar to that observed in wild-type cells; however the majority of these cells were smaller in IKKα-/- cultures than in wild type (Fig. 7, B and C). The combination of RANKL, TNFα, and TGFβ also resulted in the formation of large, multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts in IKKα-/- FLC. This effect was completely inhibited by the RANKL inhibitor osteoprotegerin (data not shown), indicating that signaling via RANK was essential for osteoclast formation. Here we have demonstrated a clear role for IKKα during osteoclastogenesis in vitro. IKKα-/- fetal liver cell cultures treated with CSF-1 and RANKL failed to form large, multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts, even after extended culture periods or with increased amounts of RANKL (not shown). However, unlike RANK or RANKL knock-out mice, which completely lack TRAP+ osteoclasts in vivo, IKKα-/- E18.5 dpc embryos did contain multinucleated TRAP+ osteoclasts, although the frequency of these cells was less than that observed in wild-type embryos. Because IKKα-/- mice die at birth, it is unclear whether the decreased number of multinucleated osteoclasts observed in these mice would result in a functional deficit in adult animals, such as a defect in tooth eruption or proper bone remodeling. Interestingly, mice lacking the upstream activator of IKKα, NIK, have no defects in basal osteoclastogenesis during development and thus have normal tooth eruption and skeletal morphology but fail to respond to osteoclastogenic stimuli, including RANKL and vitamin D (19Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Additionally, bone marrow cells from NIK-/- mice are unable to form osteoclasts when cultured in vitro with CSF-1 and RANKL. Taken together, these studies indicate that the NIK/IKKα pathway is important during stimulated but not basal osteoclastogenesis. However, NIK-/- mice are not phenotypically identical to either IKKα-/- or IKKαAA mice because they have no defects in keratinocyte differentiation, as observed in IKKα-/- mice, or in mammary gland development, as observed in IKKαAA mice (in addition to RANK- and RANKL-null mice) (17Fata J.E. Kong Y.Y. Li J. Sasaki T. Irie-Sasaki J. Moorehead R.A. Elliott R. Scully S. Voura E.B. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Khokha R. Penninger J.M.

Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Mice expressing a mutant form of NIK (aly/aly) do have defects in mammary gland development that are similar to, albeit less severe than, defects in IKKαAA mice (27Nishimura T. Koike R. Miyasaka M. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2000; 43: 351-358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet it is unknown whether either aly/aly mice or IKKαAA mice have defects in stimulated osteoclastogenesis. Given the differences between NIK-/-, aly/aly, IKKα-/-, and IKKαAA mice, it remains to be determined which functions of IKKα overlap with NIK during osteoclastogenesis (such as p100 processing) and which functions, if any, are independent of NIK. RANKL and TNFα share many common downstream signaling activities. In particular, the ability of both cytokines to activate the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB, which are required for osteoclastogenesis (7Grigoriadis A.E. Wang Z.Q. Cecchini M.G. Hofstetter W. Felix R. Fleisch H.A. Wagner E.F. Science. 1994; 266: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 28Iotsova V. Caamano J. Loy J. Yang Y. Lewin A. Bravo R. Nat.

Chem. 2004; Google Scholar), indicates the potential for redundant functions of RANKL and TNFα in osteoclast precursor cells. One distinction between TNFα- and RANKL-signaling pathways is the utilization of IKKα. We and others (19Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that RANKL activates p100 processing, which is dependent on IKKα and its upstream activator NIK (30Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). In addition to p100 processing in osteoclast precursor cells, RANKL requires IKKα for activation of the p65/p50 NF-κB transcription factor in mammary epithelial cells via phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor IκBα (18Cao Y. Bonizzi G. Seagroves T.N. Greten F.R. Johnson R. Schmidt E.V. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 763-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast, TNFα has no such requirement for IKKα during activation of p65/p50 but instead relies solely upon IKKβ and IKKγ (31Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 32Rudolph D. Yeh W.C. Wakeham A. Rudolph B. Nallainathan D. Potter J. Elia A.J. Mak T.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, TNFα has not been reported previously to induce p100 processing but instead causes accumulation of p100 mRNA and protein via p65/p50-mediated upregulation of the nfkb1 gene (33Yilmaz Z.B. Weih D.S. Sivakumar V. Weih F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that treatment of wild-type but not IKKα-/- osteoclast precursor cells with TNFα does result in a small amount of p52 processing, although the overall net effect is to increase p100 levels compared with p52. RANKL treatment, on the other hand, results in complete processing of p100 into p52. In IKKα-/- cells, both RANKL and TNFα increased p100 levels without formation of p52, effects that have also been observed in NIK-/- cells. However, although Novack et al. (19Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) reported that the result of p100 accumulation was to inhibit osteoclast differentiation in NIK-/- cells (19Novack D.V. Yin L. Hagen-Stapleton A. Schreiber R.D. Goeddel D.V. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), we found that RANKL and TNFα in combination could stimulate osteoclast formation despite the presence of high levels of p100 protein. As previous studies have shown that TNFα can synergize with RANKL to activate NF-κB and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (13Lam J. Takeshita S. Barker J.E. Kanagawa O. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1481-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), it remains possible that these types of signals are sufficient to overcome inhibition of osteoclast differentiation by p100. TGFβ has been reported to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis (26Quinn J.M. Itoh K. Udagawa N. Hausler K. Yasuda H. Shima N. Mizuno A. Higashio K. Takahashi N. Suda T. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast to a recent report indicating that TGFβ could directly stimulate osteoclast differentiation in the presence of CSF-1 (34Itonaga I. Sabokbar A. Sun S.G. Kudo O. Danks L. Ferguson D. Fujikawa Y. Athanasou N.A. Bone (NY). 2004; 34: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we did not observe any effect of TGFβ and CSF-1 on TRAP+ cell formation in wild-type fetal liver cells after 6 days in culture. However, TGFβ did augment TNFα- and RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation in wild-type fetal liver cells, which increased the size of the TRAP+ cells but not the overall number. Although TGFβ has been linked to IKKα and NF-κB p65/p50 activation via the upstream kinase TAK1 (35Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), we did not observe p100 processing in response to TGFβ treatment alone in either wild-type or IKKα-/- cells. Despite a lack of p100 processing, the ability of TNFα and TGFβ to stimulate osteoclast differentiation was IKKα-dependent. It remains to be determined whether these effects are mediated via TNFα or TGFβ signaling to IKKα via TAK1 or some other mediator. In addition to its multiple roles in diverse tissues, including mammary gland, skin, and lymphocytes, we have now shown a role for IKKα during osteoclast differentiation. Ohazama et al. (36Ohazama A. Hu Y. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Cao Y. Scheidereit C. Karin M. Sharpe P.T. Dev. Cell. 2004; 6: 219-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have recently reported that IKKα-/- mice have defects in tooth development, specifically abnormal cusp formation, a defect that has been linked previously to the TNF receptor family member ectodysplasin A receptor (37Tucker A.S. Headon D.J. Schneider P. Ferguson B.M. Overbeek P. Tschopp J. Sharpe P.T. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 4691-4700PubMed Google Scholar). Although osteoclast activity is required for eruption of teeth, it is unlikely that these defects are linked to deficient osteoclast activity because cusp formation is regulated through epithelial cell signaling interactions. IKKα-/- mice have also been reported to have multiple skeletal abnormalities, including syndactyl and shortened limbs (21Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 38Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M.

Taken together, these findings indicate that IKKα plays multiple roles in the regulation of skeletal development and may contribute to pathological conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity.

MDM2, an oncogene frequently found amplified and overexpressed in a variety of human tumors and cancers, directly interacts and inhibits the p53 tumor suppressor protein. In addition, MDM2 has been shown to stimulate E2F transactivation activity and promote S-phase entry independent of p53, yet the mechanism of which is still not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that MDM2 specifically binds to Rb C-pocket and that the central acidic domain of MDM2 is essential for Rb interaction. In addition, we show that overexpression of MDM2 reduces Rb-E2F complexes in vivo. Moreover, the ectopic expression of the wild type MDM2, but not mutant MDM2 defective in Rb interaction, stimulates E2F transactivation activity and inhibits Rb growth suppression function. Taken together, these results suggest that MDM2-mediated inhibition of Rb likely contributes to MDM2 oncogenic activity. Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a paradigm of tumor suppressors.

In this study, we demonstrate that MDM2 specifically binds to Rb C-pocket and that the central acidic domain of MDM2 is essential for Rb interaction. In addition, we show that overexpression of MDM2 reduces Rb-E2F complexes in vivo. Moreover, the ectopic expression of the wild type MDM2, but not mutant MDM2 defective in Rb interaction, stimulates E2F transactivation activity and inhibits Rb growth suppression function. Taken together, these results suggest that MDM2-mediated inhibition of Rb likely contributes to MDM2 oncogenic activity. The retinoblastoma gene is well documented as one of the most frequent targets for inactivation during the course of human tumorigenesis (1Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Retinoblastoma (Rb) 1The abbreviations used are: Rb, retinoblastoma; RbLP, Rb large pocket; RbC, Rb C-pocket; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. protein has been implicated in many cellular processes including regulation of cell cycle, DNA replication, DNA-damage repair, protection against apoptosis, and cell differentiation and senescence (1Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 2Chau B.N. Wang J.Y. Nat. Rev.

The primary function of Rb relies on its ability of interacting with the E2F family of transcription factors in the assembly of active repressor complexes to negatively regulate expression of E2F-dependent genes important for cell cycle progression (4Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 5La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rb contains three distinct protein-binding domains, the A-B domain in the middle of Rb protein and the C-terminal domain. The A-B domain called the Rb small pocket (RbSP) binds a set of proteins that contain the Rb-binding LXCXE motif. The large pocket (RbLP), containing A-B and C domains, is required for in vivo interaction with the E2F family members and is sufficient for Rb growth suppression function (6Qin X-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W. G. J Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 7Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Importantly, the Rb-E2F interaction is disrupted by the viral oncoprotein E1A, which is critical for adenovirus-mediated cellular transformation (8Bagchi S. Raychaudhuri P. Nevins J.R. Cell. 1990; 62: 659-669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal domain, called the C-pocket (RbC), has been shown to be important for the suppression of retinoblastoma formation since the deletion of Rb exons 24 and 25 located in the C-pocket causes low-penetrance retinoblastoma (9Bremner R. Du D.C. Connolly-Wilson M.J. Bridge P. Ahmad K.F. Mostachfi H. Rushlow D. Dunn J.M. Gallie B.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 556-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The C-pocket is critical for Rb interaction with E2F and for Rb growth suppression (7Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, the Rb C-pocket selectively interacts with E2F-1 and this interaction is diminished upon DNA damage (10Dick F.A. Dyson N. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Rb C-pocket interacts with MDM2 (9Bremner R. Du D.C. Connolly-Wilson M.J. Bridge P.

Overexpression of MDM2 has been observed in a variety of human tumors/cancers including ∼30% human sarcomas (14Momand J. Jung D. Wilczynski S. Niland J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3453-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that MDM2 contains a RING finger domain at the C terminus that functions as ubiquitin E3 ligase for p53 and for itself to promote the protein degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated pathway (15Honda R.

In addition to the critical regulation of p53, MDM2 has been shown to have p53-independent functions (20Michael D. Oren M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). MDM2 interacts with a set of cellular proteins, including Rb and E2F-1, to promote cell cycle G1-S transition (11Xiao Z.X.

Overproduction of MDM2 leads to DNA endoreduplication independent of p53 (23Lundgren K. Luna R.M. McNeill Y.B. Emerick E.P. Spencer B. Barfield C.R. Lozano G. Rosenberg M.P. Finlay C.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 714-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In addition, MDM2 can rescue transforming growth factor-β-induced growth arrest in a p53-independent manner (24Sun P. Dong P. Dai K. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Science. 1998; 282: 2270-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that MDM2 interacts with the Rb C-pocket and modulates the formation of Rb-E2F complexes. We show that overexpression of wild type MDM2, but not mutant MDM2 defective in Rb interaction, activates E2F and inhibits Rb growth suppression function. Thus, these data indicate that MDM2 is probably an important modulator for Rb. Cell Culture and Plasmid Construction—U2-OS, C33A, and Saos-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The p-Bam-Neo-MDM2 (from Dr. Jiandong Chen) and pCMV-Rb (11Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) were used to generate deletion mutants or point mutants by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene, Inc.) All of the mutants constructed in this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST Pull-down and Western Blot Analyses—5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled MDM2 or E2F-1 was added into 800 μlof binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH. 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a comparable amount (0.5 μg) of GST or a GST fusion protein immobilized on Sepharose-glutathione beads. After incubation for 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed for three times with the binding buffer. The proteins were separated by a SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Equal amounts of input GST or GST fusion proteins were confirmed by staining the protein gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. GST-RbC, GST-RbLP, and GST-RbLP deletion mutants were described previously (7Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 11Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). GST-Rb-(Δ785–803), GST-MDM2, and their deletion mutant derivatives were constructed by PCR-based mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MP1 peptide consisting of 11 amino acid residues corresponding to 254–264 of human MDM2 (N-LDSEDYSLSEE-C) was synthesized and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (QCB Inc.). For peptide interference assay, the synthetic peptide MP1 (10 μm) was added to the reaction mixtures containing GST, GST-MDM2, or GST-RbLP fusion protein immobilized on Sepharose-glutathione beads. After incubation on ice for 30 min, 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Rb or E2F-1 was added to the reaction mixture followed by the GST pull-down procedure. To analyze the interaction between MDM2 and hypophosphorylated Rb, U2-OS cells were lysed in EBC buffer (250 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Equal amounts of whole cell lysate (500 μg) were subjected to GST or GST-MDM2-(1–290) pull-down procedure. Proteins were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and subjected to Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody specific for Rb (G3–245, BD Biosciences). To assess the ectopic expression of MDM2 or MDM2-(Δ254–264) in U2-OS cells, cell lysates (20 μg) were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel followed by Western blot analyses using a monoclonal antibody specific for MDM2 (SMP-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). E2F Reporter Assay and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For E2F activity assay, U2-OS cells grown in 6-well tissue culture dishes with 70% confluence were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 500 ng of DHFR-luciferase, 50 ng of pCMV-E2F-1, 50 ng of pCMV-DP1, 50 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase, and 10 ng of pCMV-mRbΔp34HA (11Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) in the presence of 500 ng of pCMV-MDM2, pCMV-MDM2-(Δ254–264), or pCMV vector. 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to β-galactosidase assay and luciferase activity assay (Promega). Luciferase activity is normalized to β-galactosidase activity and presented as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. EMSA was performed essentially as described previously (25Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M. Chittenden T.

C33A cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids (5 μg of pCMV-E2F-1, 1 μg of pCMV-DP1, 10 μg of pCMV-MDM2) and increasing amounts of pCMV-RbLP or pCMV-Rb expression plasmid (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 μg, respectively) as indicated. Similarly, C33A cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of pCMV-E2F-1, 1 μg of pCMV-DP1, 3 μg of pCMV-Rb, and an increasing amount (6 or 12 μg) of pCMV-MDM2 or pCMV-MDM2-(Δ254–264). 36 h post transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared. An EMSA reaction mixture contained 10 μg of nuclear extract proteins, 1 μlof 32P-labeled double-stranded DHFR oligonucleotide (25Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M.

The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and followed by electrophoresis on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-EDTA buffer and autoradiography. In the competition assay, cold wild type or mutant E2F-double-stranded oligonucleotide (50-fold in excess) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added in the reaction mixture and incubated for 20 min prior to the addition of 32P-labeled probe. Rb Growth Suppression Assay—The Rb growth suppression assay was essentially performed as described previously (6Qin X-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W. G.

Saos-2 cells grown on 100-mm plates to 80% confluency were co-transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) with a DNA mixture containing 5 μg of pCMV-Rb, 2 μg of pCMV-puromycin encoding the puromycin-resistant gene, and 10 μg of pCMV-E2F-1, pCMV-MDM2, or pCMV-MDM2-(Δ254–264). 48 h after transfection, transfected cells were selected in the growth medium supplemented with puromycin (0.5 μg/ml), which were changed every other day. 12 days after selection, cells with a unique large flat morphology induced by ectopically expressed Rb (6Qin X-Q.

At least three independent experiments in triplicate were performed with at least 300 cells counted for each transfection sample. The Amino Acid Residues 785–803 in the Rb C-pocket Are Critical for Rb-MDM2 Interaction—We have previously shown that Rb and MDM2 form a stable complex in vitro and in vivo and that the Rb C-pocket (amino acid residues 792–928) is important for Rb interaction with MDM2 (11Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). To further identify the domains of Rb involved in MDM2 interaction, we used a set of GST-Rb fusion proteins with an internal deletion in the Rb C-pocket to examine its ability of binding to in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled MDM2 protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, the RbLP (amino acids 379–928) retained the full capacity in interaction with MDM2, whereas a small deletion in the C-pocket led to a clear decrease in Rb-MDM2 interaction. Notably, a deletion mutant in the Rb C-pocket (RbLP-(Δ803–909)) still retained considerable MDM2 binding activity (Fig. 1A, lane 6). In contrast, a mutant with an additional deletion of 19 amino acid residues (RbLP-(Δ785–909)) had little MDM2 interaction (Fig. 1A, lane 7), suggesting that this 19 amino acid segment is important for Rb interaction with MDM2. Indeed, a deletion mutant lacking this segment, RbLP-(Δ785–803), was unable to interact with MDM2 (Fig. 1B, lane 5), demonstrating that the amino acid residues 785–803 in the Rb C-pocket is a critical module for MDM2 interaction. Of note, it has been shown that the region adjacent to the module in the Rb C-pocket (amino acids 841–870) is important for Rb interaction with E2F-1 (7Hiebert S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3384-3391Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the MDM2-binding module is also important in E2F-1 interaction. As shown in Fig. 1B, RbLP-(Δ785–803) was incapable of interacting with E2F-1, indicating that this amino acid module (amino acids 785–803) is also important for Rb-E2F-1 interaction. Taken together, these data indicate that the amino acid residues 785–803 in the Rb C-pocket are critical for both Rb-MDM2 and Rb-E2F-1 interaction. The Amino Acid Residues 254–264 in the Central Acidic Region of MDM2 Are Essential for Rb Interaction—To identify the binding site of MDM2 for Rb, we used Rb C-pocket fused to GST (GST-RbC) for interaction with the in vitro translated [35S]Met-labeled MDM2 protein or its deletion mutant derivatives. As shown in Fig. 2A, Rb C-pocket interacted well with the full-length human MDM2-(1–491) but not with the MDM2 deletion mutant lacking amino acid residues 234–284 (Fig. 2A, lane 5), suggesting that the Rb interaction domain may reside in this segment. Furthermore, Rb C-pocket bound MDM2-(Δ264–284) (Fig. 2A, lane 8) but not MDM2-(Δ254–284) (Fig. 2A, lane 11), indicating that the amino acid segment 254–264 of MDM2 is critical for Rb interaction. Indeed, the deletion of the segment 254–264 totally abolished MDM2 interaction with Rb (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), whereas it retained the interaction with E2F-1 (Fig. 2B, lanes 7 and 8). Moreover, a synthetic peptide (MP1), consisting of the corresponding sequence of 11 amino acid residues 254–264 of MDM2, was able to disrupt the MDM2 interaction with Rb (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data indicate that the segment of amino acid residues 254–264 of MDM2, which is highly conserved evolutionarily (Fig. 2C), is critical for MDM2-Rb interaction.Fig. 3MDM2 preferably interacts with hypophosphorylated Rb and affects Rb-E2F interaction in vitro. A, an equal amount of U2-OS cell lysates (500 μg) was subjected to GST or GST-MDM2 pull-down procedure followed by Western blot analysis for Rb protein. An aliquot of cell lysates (50 μg) was directly loaded on the gel as control. The hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated Rb species are indicated. B, 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Rb was added to the reaction mixture containing GST-MDM2 fusion protein immobilized on Sepharose-glutathione beads in the presence (lane 2) or absence (lane 3) of synthetic peptide MP1 (10 μm) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. 1 μlof[35S]Met-Rb was directly loaded (lane 1). C, 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled E2F-1 was mixed with an equal amount of GST (lane 2) or GST-RbLP fusion protein (lanes 3–7) in the presence of an increasing amount of MP1 (0. 1, 2, 5, and 10 μm) and subjected to GST pull-down assay followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 1 μl of [35S]Met-E2F-1 was directly loaded (lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MDM2 Reduces Rb-E2F Complex Formation in Vivo—Because E2F-1 has been shown to preferably interact with hypophosphorylated Rb (25Shirodkar S. Ewen M. DeCaprio J.A. Morgan J. Livingston D.M. Chittenden T. Cell. 1992; 68: 157-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 28Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 58: 1097-1105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar), we examined whether MDM2 has a preference for interaction with certain species of Rb. As shown in Fig. 3A, MDM2 also preferentially interacted with hypophosphorylated Rb protein species, suggesting that MDM2 selectively targets hypophosphorylated Rb. Given that both MDM2 and E2F-1 bind to the Rb C-pocket in the same region and both interact with hypophosphorylated Rb, we investigated whether MDM2 interferes with Rb association with E2F-1. We first examined the effect of MP1 peptide on Rb interaction with E2F-1 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3C, the addition of an increasing amount of the MP1 peptide in the reaction mixture led to a marked decrease of Rb association with E2F-1, suggesting that this MDM2 peptide can block Rb interaction with E2F-1 in vitro. We then investigated the effects of MDM2 on Rb-E2F-1 complexes in vivo. We chose the human cervical carcinoma cell line C33A, because it bears a mutant Rb protein incapable of interaction with E2F (29Scheffner M. Munger K. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). As expected, the ectopic expression of either RbLP (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–4) or full-length Rb (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–5) in C33A cells led to specific Rb-E2F-1 complex formation in a dose-dependent manner. Co-expression of MDM2 significantly inhibited the Rb-E2F-1-DNA complex formation as shown by EMSA (Fig. 4, A, lanes 5–7, and B, lanes 7–9). Furthermore, this inhibitory effect of MDM2 was dependent on its physical interaction with Rb since co-expression of wild type MDM2, but not mutant MDM2-(Δ254–264) defective in Rb binding activity, led to a clear reduction of Rb-E2F-1 complex (Fig. 4C). However, no significant changes in free E2F-1 complexes were observed in MDM2-overexpressing cells. Taken together, these data suggest that overexpression of MDM2 can reduce Rb-E2F-DNA complex formation. MDM2 Blocks Rb-mediated Suppression of E2F Activity and Inhibits Rb Growth Suppression Function—We next investigated the effects of MDM2 on Rb function. Although the expression of Rb significantly inhibited E2F-1-mediated transactivation activity in U2-OS cells, co-expression of wild type MDM2, but not MDM2-(Δ254–264), effectively blocked the Rb-mediated inhibition on E2F activity (Fig. 5A). It has been well established that the ectopic expression of Rb in Saos-2 cells (Rb null and p53 null) leads to growth arrest at G1 manifested by flat and enlarged cell morphology (6Qin X-Q. Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin W. G. J Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 27Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, the expression of Rb in Saos-2 cells resulted in predominantly large flat cells (80 ± 5%). The co-expression of E2F-1, as expected, effectively rescued Rb-induced large flat cell phenotype. Co-expression of wild type MDM2 led to a significant reduction of Rb-induced large flat cells, whereas MDM2-(Δ254–264) exhibited only marginal effects. Taken together, these data indicate that the ability of MDM2 to directly interact with Rb is critical for MDM2 inhibition of Rb growth suppression function independent of p53. It is well established that the disruption of the tumor suppressor pathways (Rb and p53) is critical for the development of a majority of human tumors. MDM2 has been documented as a key regulator for p53. In this study, we demonstrate that the binding of MDM2 to Rb reduces the formation of Rb-E2F-1-DNA complex, resulting in the inhibition of Rb growth suppression function, suggesting that MDM2 is also a critical regulator for Rb. We have previously shown that Rb C-pocket is important for MDM2 interaction (11Xiao Z.X. Chen J. Levine A. Modjtahedi N. Xing J. Sellers W. Livingston D.M. Nature. 1995; 375: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), which were confirmed by several independent studies (9Bremner R. Du D.C. Connolly-Wilson M.J. Bridge P. Ahmad K.F. Mostachfi H.

Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that MDM2 activates E2F through its physical interaction with Rb. First, the amino acid segment 785–803 of Rb is important for the interaction of both E2F and MDM2. Second, wild type MDM2, but not Rb-binding mutant MDM2, reduces the Rb-E2F complex. Third, a MDM2 peptide consisting of the Rb-binding module can block Rb interaction with E2F-1 in vitro. Fourth and most importantly, the wild type MDM2 inhibits Rb-mediated suppression of E2F-1. In contrast, mutant MDM2 defective in Rb interaction while retaining the ability of interaction with E2F-1 fails to do so. These data indicate that the physical interaction between MDM2 and Rb is required for the action of MDM2 in stimulating E2F. Rb is best known as a transcriptional repressor, which is tethered to promoters through its interaction with members of the E2F family proteins. Rb can directly bind to and block the activation domain of E2F proteins. Perhaps, more importantly, when Rb binds E2F, it recruits chromatin-remodeling factors such as histone deacetylases, SWI/SNF factors, Polycomb group proteins, or methyltransferases to nearby surrounding nucleosome structures, thereby actively repressing transcription of promoters that contain E2F sites (4Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 30Zhang H.S. Dean D.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3134-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the assembly of such Rb-E2F repressor complexes on promoters is critical for Rb-mediated growth suppression (30Zhang H.S. Dean D.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3134-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the overexpression of MDM2 inhibits the formation of the Rb-E2F-DNA complex, suggesting that MDM2 stimulates E2F activity probably through interacting with Rb and modulating the Rb-E2F-1 repressor complexes on DNA. Interestingly, although the overexpression of MDM2 can markedly reduce Rb-E2F-DNA complexes, no significant changes in free E2F-1 complexes were observed in the same cells as assessed by EMSA. These data suggest that MDM2 may function in inhibiting Rb association with E2F-DNA complexes, thus blocking the assembly of transcription repressor complexes rather than the dissociation of existing Rb-E2F complexes. Consistent with this notion, the ectopic expression of wild type MDM2, but not Rb-binding mutant MDM2, inhibits Rb-mediated suppression of E2F. In addition, we have shown that the 11-amino acid module (amino acid residues 254–264) located in central acidic domain of MDM2 is critical for Rb binding and for MDM2-mediated E2F activation. Interestingly, the acidic domain of MDM2 (amino acids 200–300) has been shown as an interaction module for proteins such as alternative reading frame protein (31Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N.

Moreover, this region also appears to be critical for MDM2 function toward p53 protein ubiquitination and degradation (36Argentini M. Barboule N. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Kawai H. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell.

Since it has been reported that MDM2-p53-Rb can form a trimeric complex resulting in Rb-mediated p53 protein stabilization (12Hsieh J.K. Chan F.S. O'Connor D.J. Mittnacht S. Zhong S. Lu X. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 181-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), it raises an interesting possibility that Rb binds MDM2, thereby inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation. One primary function of MDM2 is to negatively regulate p53 by facilitating p53 ubiquitination and degradation. Thus, amplification and overexpression of MDM2 has been viewed as an alternative way of inactivating p53. However, a number of sarcomas, leukemia, and carcinomas have been documented that harbor p53 mutations and overproduce MDM2 (39Cordon-Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clinically, it has been shown that sarcoma patients with both mutant p53 and high levels of MDM2 had a much lower survival rate than those patients who had only one of these alterations (39Cordon-Cardo C. Latres E. Drobnjak M. Oliva M.R. Pollack D. Woodruff J.M. Marechal V. Chen J. Brennan M.F. Levine A.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 794-799PubMed Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of MDM2-mediated p53-independent tumor-promoting function. Here, we demonstrate that MDM2 binds Rb, interferes with Rb-E2F complexes, and inhibits Rb growth suppression function. These findings are consistent with the notion that MDM2 plays an important role in promoting cell cycle progression and human tumorigenesis. We thank Drs. Jiandong Chen and Scott Hiebert for plasmids, Drs. Jiandong Chen and Nicolas Dyson for MDM2 and Rb antibodies. We thank Drs. Xin Lu, Jiandong Chen, and Yue Xiong for helpful discussion.

Similarly, tissue responses to hypoxia are largely mediated through the HIF-1 heterodimeric transcription factor, comprising hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and ARNT. The latter response is essential for a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolytic anaerobic metabolism as well as for angiogenesis and has been implicated as necessary for growth in many solid tumors. In this report, we demonstrate that the thyroid hormone receptor/retinoblastoma-interacting protein 230 (TRIP230) interacts directly with ARNT and is essential for both hypoxic and TCDD-mediated transcriptional responses. We initially identified TRIP230 as an ARNT-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid assay screen. This interaction was confirmed in mammalian cell systems using co-immunoprecipitation and in mammalian two-hybrid assays. Furthermore, TRIP230 could be recorded at sites of activated transcription of either TCDD- or hypoxia-inducible genes in a stimulus-dependent fashion by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis.

Hogenesch J.B. Bradfield C.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 519-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). This group of proteins comprises the basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM domain (bHLH-PAS) family of transcription factors. One such factor, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), is a ligand-activated transcription factor that binds environmental contaminants such as dioxin/TCDD. Ligand activation of AHR results in the disruption of the cytoplasmic AHR complex that contains two molecules of HSP90, a co-chaperone, p23, and one molecule of the immunophilin-like protein hepatitis B virus X-associated protein 2 (2Carver L.A.

This, in turn, leads to the nuclear translocation of AHR, allowing it to form a functional heterodimeric transcription factor with ARNT, thereby activating target gene transcription (7Hankinson O.

The HIF-1 complex (HIF-1α/ARNT) activates at least 40 known target genes through binding its cognate DNA response element, the HIF-1α response element (HRE) (9Huang L.E. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19575-19578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), and is necessary for development, the inflammatory response, regulation of angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, and solid tumor growth and metastasis (10Harris A.L.

The mechanisms by which HIF-1α is regulated under normoxic conditions are reasonably well understood. Normoxic conditions supply proline hydroxylases with O2 as a substrate for the hydroxylation of HIF-1α proline residues 402 and 564 (13Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A.

These hydroxylated residues are recognized by the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ligase complex (15Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C.

HIF-1α is further regulated under normoxic conditions by hydroxylation of an asparaginyl group at amino acid 803 in its carboxyl-terminal activation domain (20Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). This asparaginyl hydroxylase, termed factor-inhibiting HIF (21Mahon P.C. Hirota K. Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), prevents the recruitment of CBP by the transcriptional activation domain of HIF (22Hewitson K.S. McNeill L.A. Riordan M.V. Tian Y.M. Bullock A.N. Welford R.W. Elkins J.M. Oldham N.J. Bhattacharya S. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

Beyond the DNA binding of its cognate response element, the mechanisms whereby HIF-1 activates gene transcription are understood in only broad terms. Upon hypoxic stabilization, HIF-1α translocates to the nucleus and forms a functional heterodimeric transcription factor with ARNT. This complex is then capable of recruiting CBP through direct interactions with either HIF-1α or ARNT (24Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M.

Furthermore, ARNT is capable of recruiting the p160/bHLH-PAS co-activators SRC-1 and nuclear co-activator-2/GRIP1/TIF2 (27Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), which also interact with AHR as well as other transcriptional coactivators (28Kumar M.B. Perdew G.H. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 273-286PubMed Google Scholar, 29Carlson D.B. Perdew G.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These proteins are incorporated into multimeric complexes, which interact with and modulate the activity of the core transcriptional machinery as well as modifying local chromatin structure (29Carlson D.B. Perdew G.H. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2002; 16: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The intrinsic functions of transcription factors are therefore modulated by the recruitment of ancillary proteins termed co-activators and co-repressors. The wide diversity of transactivators appears to recruit protein complexes consisting of common pools of these co-activator/co-repressor proteins. The recruitment and assembly of these proteins is dictated, at least in part, by the DNA binding transcription factor and the cis-acting element it binds, allowing transmission of the genetic information in the transcriptional regulatory regions of target genes to the core transcriptional machinery. This level of specificity is required for the appropriate and controlled regulation of target gene transcription. Heterodimeric ARNT complexes facilitate the activation of target gene transcription by the formation of complexes with several known transcriptional modifiers, including those stated above as well as with Brahma-related gene 1 and components of the mediator complex (31Wang S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11821-11827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 32Wang S. Ge K. Roeder R.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying activated transcription by the AHR and HIF heterodimeric complexes is central to our understanding the complex pathologies responsible for a wide spectrum of human diseases including chemical carcinogenesis, solid tumor growth, and atherosclerosis. The thyroid hormone receptor/retinoblastoma protein-interacting protein 230 (TRIP230) was identified as a potential co-activator of the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) (33Chang K.H. Chen Y. Chen T.T. Chou W.H. Chen P.L. Ma Y.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9040-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). TRIP230 is capable of co-activating TR-mediated gene transcription in a ligand-dependent manner and harbors an LXXLL motif in its putative carboxyl-terminal TR interaction domain. We identified TRIP230 in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a potential interaction partner for ARNT. We reasoned that it might act as a transcriptional co-activator of ARNT-dependent gene activation. In this report, we present strong evidence that ARNT recruits TRIP230 as a transcriptional co-activator for the activation of both AHR- and HIF-1α-regulated genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TRIP230 is essential for transactivation by both the AHR and HIF complexes. Plasmid Constructs and Vectors—The ARNT bait, pMP17c-ARNTΔQ, used for yeast two-hybrid library screening has been described previously (27Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S.

For the identification of the ARNT interaction domain within TRIP230, ARNTΔQ was transferred into the bait plasmid pBTM117c. TRIP230 yeast two-hybrid constructs have been described previously (33Chang K.H. Chen Y. Chen T.T. Chou W.H. Chen P.L. Ma Y.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl.

The hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged mARNT cDNA expression construct was the kind gift of Jerry Pelletier (34Moffett P. Reece M. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4933-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse and human HIF-1α cDNAs were isolated from mouse and human yeast two-hybrid prey libraries and cloned into pcDNA3.1HisC. The VP-16 TRIP230 deletion mutants were constructed by excising the existing TRIP230 deletion mutants from pACT2 and cloned in frame into VP-16. Cloning of TRIP230 by Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Cloning—The yeast strain, L40C, has been described previously (35Probst M.R. Fan C.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Dr. John Colicelli. Approximately 2 × 106 recombinants were transformed into L40C containing pMP-17c-ARNTΔQ and plated onto medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. Transformants that conferred growth were picked and isolated and reintroduced to the bait in L40C to confirm interaction. In order to identify the strongest interacting clones, single colonies were picked and grown individually in synthetic complete medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. To assay for dimerization capability, equal amounts of plasmid-containing L40C were resuspended in 500 μl of modified Z-buffer (40 mm NaH2PO4, 60 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.0). Fifty μl of 0.1% SDS and three drops of CHCl3 were added, and samples were vortexed for 1 min. Two hundred μl of 4 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside in 0.1 m NaPO4 (pH 7.0) was added to each sample, and reactions were incubated at 37 °C. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the absorbance of supernatants was measured at 420 nm. All values were derived from two or more transformations; each determination was performed in triplicate, and final values are the result of four separate experiments. For mapping of the ARNT interaction domain within TRIP230, the EGY48 yeast strain was transformed with minimal deletions of TRIP230, cloned into pACT2 and pBTM117c-ARNTΔQ, grown in the appropriate medium, and subjected to the liquid culture assay, as described above. In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation—For interaction studies with TRIP230, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of either AHR, HIF-1α, or HA-tagged mARNT or 5 μg of untagged mARNT and 5 μg of TRIP230 expression plasmid, and samples were prepared as described previously (27Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4319-4333Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested in 1× LysS buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, and 10 μg each of leupeptin, antipain, and aprotinin per ml) for 30 min on ice. Cellular debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 × g in a Beckman L-65 centrifuge with an SW55 Ti rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were assayed for protein concentration with Bio-Rad protein assay solution, following the manufacturer's protocol. Affinity-purified antibodies directed against the influenza virus HA tag epitope or control mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse antisera generated against TRIP230 have been described previously (33Chang K.H. Chen Y. Chen T.T. Chou W.H. Chen P.L. Ma Y.Y. Yang-Feng T.L. Leng X. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Lee W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9040-9045Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For each reaction, 1 mg of cell lysate was incubated with 5 μg of affinity-purified anti-HA or the corresponding preimmune IgG overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were then mixed with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) on a rotating wheel at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then washed six times with LysS buffer, and proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 3 min. Complexes were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with anti-TRIP230 antisera. Precipitated complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG and an ECL kit (Pierce). Mapping of the ARNT Interaction Domain in TRIP230 —For mapping of the ARNT interaction domain within TRIP230, the EGY48 yeast strain was transformed with deletion mutants of TRIP230 cloned into pACT2 together with pBTM117c-ARNTΔQ, grown in the appropriate medium, and subjected to the liquid culture assay, as described above. For mammalian two-hybrid assays with the GAL4-DBD-ARNT fusion, 250 ng of pG5E4T and 250 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase were co-transfected either alone or with 1 μg of the GAL4-DBD-ARNT construct and 1 μg of TRIP230 deletion mutant expression plasmid or empty plasmid vector into HEK 293T cells (hereafter referred to as 293T cells). Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection and analyzed as described above. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays in Mammalian Cells—Luciferase reporter gene assays for analyzing the response to dioxin were performed as described previously (27Beischlag T.V.

In the hypoxia experiments, Hepa-1 cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units of streptomycin and penicillin per ml. Typically, 500 ng each of the 4× HRE-driven luciferase and pCMV-β-Gal reporter plasmids was co-transfected with either 2 or 5 μg of either TRIP230 cDNA expression plasmid or empty vector into 6-well plates. The final DNA concentration was adjusted to 6 μg/well with empty expression vector, and transfection was achieved with 15 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 16–20 h after transfection, the plates were transferred to a hypoxia incubator and maintained at 5% CO2 and 1% O2 for another 18 h. Cells were then harvested and assayed as described previously (27Beischlag T.V. Wang S. Rose D.W. Torchia J. Reisz-Porszasz S. Muhammad K. Nelson W.E. Probst M.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Hankinson O. Mol.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Hepa-1 and MCF-7 cells were treated with either 5 × 10-9m TCDD or vehicle for 30–90 min or exposed to hypoxia for 6–8 h. Cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% in 7.8 m HEPES buffer at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of harvest buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaOH) and incubated at 42 °C for 15 min, and then collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g. Cells were washed sequentially in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, Buffer 1 (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5) and Buffer 2 (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). Cells were pelleted at 200 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.3 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were sonicated to yield DNA fragments ranging in size from 200 to 900 bp. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 10-fold to a final solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and complete protease inhibitor mixture. The solutions were precleared with 50 μl of 50% slurry protein A or protein G-Sepharose containing 2.0 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and the appropriate control IgG for 1 h at 4 °C. Eluates were then incubated with affinity-purified antibodies specific to various factors overnight at 4 °C followed by the addition of 50 μl of 50% slurry of protein A or protein G-Sepharose and incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h. Sepharose beads were pelleted and washed sequentially for 10 min each in TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and Buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1). Beads were washed another three times in Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 300 ml of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Chemical cross-links were reversed by heating the samples overnight at 65 °C. DNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated using Pellet Paint (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocols.

Briefly, cells were maintained in 10% fetal calf serum. Immediately after injection, cells injected with the xenobiotic compound-responsive element (XRE)-LacZ reporter were treated with either 5 × 10-9m TCDD or 0.1% Me2SO and incubated for a further 18 h. Cells injected with the HRE-LacZ reporter were incubated overnight under normoxic conditions, and then cells were incubated for a further 24 h at either 1 or 20% O2. RNA Interference, Reverse Transcription, and Real Time PCR Assays—To negate the expression of TRIP230, a small interfering RNA duplex targeting the sequence 5′-AAACTGCAGTCAGCTGCTCAG-3′ of human (and mouse) TRIP230 as well as a scrambled control oligonucleotide, 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′, were synthesized by Qiagen. Hepa-1 cells were transfected with 100 nm small interfering RNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 10-8m TCDD for an additional 24 h or either 1% O2 or 100 μm CoCl2 for an additional 9 h. To assess the effects of the small interfering RNA on TRIP230 protein levels, whole cell extracts were obtained, and 30 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and TRIP230 protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis as described above. For analysis of the effect of small interfering TRIP230 on endogenous CYP1A1 and VEGF induction, total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed using a Taqman reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. 5 μg of total RNA was used in a 20-μl reaction and amplified by cycling between 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min (Bio-Rad Icycler). To generate a standard curve, 5 μl of each diluted cDNA was combined into one tube (10,000×), and 10-fold serial dilutions were performed until a 1× sample was reached. Endogenous CYP1A1, VEGF, and the ribosomal subunit 36B4 mRNA were analyzed by the Taqman real time PCR assay. Taqman primers for 36B4 (5′-AGATGCAGCCAGATCCGCAT-3′ and 5′-GTTCTTGCCCATCAGCACC-3′), for CYP1A1 (5′-GCTTGAGTGAGAAGGTCACTCTCTT-3′ and 5′-CGATCGGCCAATGGTCTCT-3′), and VEGF (5′-CGCTGGTAGACGTCCATGAA-3′ and 5′-CTGTACCTCCACCATGCCAAGT-3′) and dual labeled Taqman probes containing Fam™ fluorescent dye on the 5′ end and TAMRA fluorescent dye quencher on the 3′ end (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) for mouse CYP1A1 (5′-TTTGGGCAAGCGAAAGTGCATCG-3′), mouse VEGF (5′-TCCCAGGCTGCACCCACGACA-3′) and 36B4 (5′-CGCTCCGAGGGAAGGCCG-3′) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. CYP1A1 and VEGF mRNA levels were normalized relative to the amount of 36B4 mRNA. Taqman assays were performed using an Applied Biosystems Inc. 7700 machine. Real time PCR parameters were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 92 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Identification of TRIP230 as an ARNT-interacting Protein—In order to identify ARNT-interacting proteins, an exhaustive screen of several yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries was performed, using as bait a cDNA (ARNTΔQ) encoding the amino-terminal 687 amino acids of the mARNT protein fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain. The L40C yeast strain, which has been described previously (35Probst M.R. Fan C.M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4451-4457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was transformed with the ARNTΔQ bait plasmid, followed by transformation with one of several cDNA libraries fused to the B42 acid patch transcriptional activation domain. Clones positive for growth on medium lacking histidine were selected, isolated, and sequenced. (Full-length ARNT could not be used as bait, because this construct generated colonies on the histidine plates at very high frequency, even in the absence of an interacting prey construct, due to the transactivation domain located toward the C terminus of ARNT.) Several of the clones encoded either amino-terminal fragments or, in one case, full-length HIF-1α, suggesting that at least some of the clones identified encoded bona fide ARNT-interacting proteins. Clones with long open reading frames were reintroduced into yeast containing the bait plasmid and tested in a liquid culture assay for β-galactosidase activity. Several novel strongly interacting clones based on β-galactosidase activity were identified from the human fetal brain cDNA library screen. One of the clones isolated contained a cDNA with a"

Transcription in archaea is notable for its essentially mosaic character: the core transcription apparatus, RNA polymerase (RNAP) 1The abbreviation used is: RNAP, RNA polymerase.1The abbreviation used is: RNAP, RNA polymerase. and the essential factors for promoter recognition, initiation, and elongation of transcripts, is of eukaryal type, while the DNA-binding transcriptional regulators are predominantly (although not exclusively) of bacterial type (reviewed in Ref. 1Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4658-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This mixed nature of the archaeal transcription machinery does not pose conceptual difficulties for the understanding of archaeal transcriptional repressors, which perform their inhibitory roles by physically blocking the assembly of the basal machinery at promoters (reviewed in Ref. 2Ouhammouch M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is, however, much less clear how bacterial type transcription factors can activate transcription in such systems. The 12-subunit RNA polymerase from the hyperthermophile Methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been assembled from recombinant subunits in vitro. In conjunction with the likewise recombinant basal transcription factors TFB and TBP, the recombinant RNAP is capable of promoter-specific transcription (3Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii also encodes two putative transcription regulators, Ptr1 and Ptr2, that are members of the Lrp/AsnC family of bacterial transcription regulators (4Brinkman A.B. Ettema T.J. De Vos W.M. Van Der Oost J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Ptr2 is a potent activator of transcription in vitro and conveys its stimulatory effects on its cognate transcription machinery from two upstream Ptr2-binding sites. Activation is achieved, at least in part, by Ptr2-mediated recruitment of TBP to the promoter (5Ouhammouch M. Dewhurst R.E. Hausner W. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5097-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Prior work on this system was complicated by the fact that it employed conventionally purified archaeal RNAP fractions. It therefore could not be ruled out that these might contain small amounts of other, not yet characterized (e.g. RNAP-associated), factors that influenced the transcription-stimulating properties of the preparation. The availability of a completely defined recombinant enzyme puts this critique to the test and allows a precise dissection of the functional contributions of all the components present in the transcription reaction. Here we report the construction and characteristics of an entirely recombinant system for positively regulated archaeal transcription and define fundamental parameters of transcription stimulation. Protein Purification—The recombinant RNA polymerase from Methanococcus/Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was assembled and purified essentially as described (3Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The overproduction and purification of the recombinant M. jannaschii transcription factors TBP and TFB have also been described (5Ouhammouch M. Dewhurst R.E. Hausner W. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5097-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). M. jannaschii TFE was overproduced in Escherichia coli Rosetta (pLysS) (Stratagene) harboring plasmid pMO-194. This plasmid expresses a fusion gene encoding an N-terminal His6 tag, followed by the product of the M. jannaschii MJ0777 open reading frame. The His-tagged factor was affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetate-agarose and was eluted with 250 mm imidazole. Protein concentrations were measured by using the Micro BCA assay (Pierce), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. DNA Templates—DNA fragments encompassing the M. jannaschii rb2 promoter region were generated by PCR, using oligonucleotides ON116 (5′-GGGAATACGAAAAAGAGATTCTGC-3′) and ON117 (5′-CGGCTCACCTTTGTCTTCATCATAC-3′), and were purified by native PAGE. In Vitro Transcription—Reaction mixtures for Fig. 1 were assembled in 50 μl (final volume) of transcription buffer (20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% (w/v) glycerol, 600 mm trehalose, 500 mm betaine, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG 3300)). Transcription reactions analyzed in Fig. 2A contained 450 mm instead of 500 mm NaCl. Preinitiation complexes were assembled by using 4 nm linear template DNA (200 fmol), 20 nm TBP, 20 nm TFB, and ∼30 nm RNA polymerase, for 20 min at 65 °C. Single rounds of transcription were then initiated by the addition of nucleoside triphosphates to 0.4 mm concentration each of ATP, CTP, and GTP; 32 μm [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci (1 Ci = 37 GBq)/mmol), poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) to 80 μg/ml; and 18 units of RNase inhibitor, for 15 min. The addition of 80 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) prevents reinitiation, thus limiting transcription to a single round. Sample preparation (extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitation with ethanol), resolution by electrophoresis on denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel, visualization by phosphorimaging, and quantification followed standard procedures.Fig. 2TFE action in the recombinant in vitro system. A, a requirement for subunits F/E and K. Single-round transcription reactions were carried out in the absence (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or presence of 200 nm TFE (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) using the indicated RNAP assemblies.

Single-round transcription reactions were carried out in the absence of Ptr2 (lanes 1–4) or in the presence of 400 nm Ptr2 (lanes 5–8), in the absence of TFE (lanes 1 and 5) or the presence of 60 nm (lanes 2 and 6), 180 nm (lanes 3 and 7) or 540 nm (lanes 4 and 8) TFE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined the ability of the fully recombinant M. jannaschii in vitro transcription system to sustain Ptr2-dependent transcriptional activation at the previously analyzed rb2 promoter (Fig. 1A). Ptr2 strongly stimulates transcription at this very weak promoter (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–4) to levels similar to those previously reported for native M. jannaschii RNAP (5Ouhammouch M. Dewhurst R.E. Hausner W. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5097-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results thus prove that transcriptional activation in archaea does not depend on any yet uncharacterized activities, such as coactivators, and can be fully and accurately reproduced in a completely defined in vitro system. The ability to omit individual subunits, or sets of subunits, from the polymerase assembly opens up an opportunity for a functional dissection of this archaeal enzyme and of its interactions with the initiation factors as well as with transcriptional effectors/regulators. As already shown in the context of other promoters (3Werner F. Weinzierl R.O. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), subunits H, K, and F/E (homologous to RNAPII subunits Rpb5, Rpb6, and Rpb4/Rpb7, respectively) are not essential for basal rb2 transcription. Indeed, the corresponding subunit drop-out enzymes also support Ptr2-activated transcription (Fig. 1C, lanes 4, 6, and 8), indistinguishably from the fully assembled 12-subunit enzyme (Fig. 1C, lane 2); we thus conclude that RNAP subunits H, K, and F/E are neither required for, nor contribute to, the activating effect of Ptr2 at the rb2 promoter. Either Ptr2 activates rb2 transcription solely by recruiting TBP to the promoter (5Ouhammouch M. Dewhurst R.E. Hausner W. Thomm M. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5097-5102Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), or its functionally significant interactions with RNAP are confined to the assembly core. The transcription of some archaeal promoters has also been shown to be stimulated by an additional archaeal basal factor, TFE, under conditions of suboptimal TBP-TATA box interaction (6Bell S.D. Brinkman A.B. van der Oost J. Jackson S.P. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7Hanzelka B.L. Darcy T.J. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1813-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This factor is a homologue of one of the two subunits of eukaryotic TFIIE and has been found in nearly all sequenced archaeal genomes. A recently determined crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of TFE from Sulfolobus solfataricus shows an extended winged helix fold that may function as an adaptor between TBP, polymerase, and, possibly, promoter DNA (8Meinhart A. Blobel J. Cramer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48267-48274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since Ptr2 also exerts its stimulatory effect by stabilizing a weak TBP/TATA-box complex, we wondered whether the actions of Ptr2 and TFE might synergize. The effects of recombinant M. jannaschii TFE on transcription by the recombinant M. jannaschii RNAP are shown in Fig. 2A. As expected, TFE stimulates basal levels of transcription at the weak rb2 promoter (∼2-fold; lane 2) and to a somewhat greater extent at the more diverged (cryptic) promoter, P′ (∼3-fold; lane 2). TFE also stimulates transcription by recombinant enzyme lacking subunit H (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Enzyme preparations lacking either subunit K or F/E failed, however, to respond to TFE (Fig. 2A, lanes 6 and 8). Both of these mutant phenotypes are due to the absence of F/E, as incorporation of the F/E heterodimer into RNAP depends on K. 2F. Werner and R. O. J. Weinzierl, unpublished observations. The recently solved structure of the complete 12-subunit yeast RNAPII shows Rpb4/Rpb7 binding (through the N-terminal domain of Rpb7) to a pocket formed by subunits Rpb1, Rpb2, and Rpb6 (Fig. 2B) (9Armache K.J. Kettenberger H. Cramer P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6964-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 10Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6969-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), with most of the Rpb4/Rpb7 surface exposed and accessible for interactions with general transcription factors and, possibly, nucleic acids. This topography is likely to be preserved in RNAPI, RNAPIII, and archaeal RNAPs (11Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Siaut M. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Peyroche G. Levillain E. Siaut M. Callebaut I. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Riva M. Carles C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14670-14675Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); the F/E dimer, like Rpb4/Rpb7, could serve as a bridge to initiation factors. In the RNAPII transcription cycle, TFIIE functions along with TFIIH primarily in steps that follow RNAPII entry into the promoter complex. TFIIE binds directly to RNAPII (13Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and may interact with double-stranded as well as single-stranded DNA in the promoter complex. Electron crystallographic analysis shows TFIIE binding near the RNAPII cleft (14Leuther K.K. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 773-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), consistent with DNA interaction in the vicinity of the transcription start site (15Forget D. Langelier M.F. Therien C. Trinh V. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our present work uncovers a role for the archaeal homologue of the eukaryotic Rpb4/Rpb7 complex in TFE-dependent enhancement of archaeal transcription. It is not clear, however, whether this role is direct, through intimate protein-protein contacts between TFE and the F/E complex during preinitiation complex assembly and initiation, or indirect, through structural constraints imposed by the F/E complex on the conformational state of the RNAP clamp and its mobility relative to the other structural domains of the enzyme. The available information about TFIIE does not provide a clear distinction between these alternatives. Indeed, TFIIE may contact widely separated parts of the RNAPII surface (15Forget D. Langelier M.F. Therien C. Trinh V. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1122-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Alternatively, bubble opening may be hampered by the increased flexibility of the clamp that results from the loss of Rpb4/Rpb7. Having gained further insight into the functional contribution of TFE to basal transcription, we next asked whether TFE would have a similar effect on Ptr2-activated transcription. The results shown in Fig. 2C demonstrate that this is not the case; the presence of TFE does not “superactivate” transcription (lanes 6–8). In summary, our findings specify that the stimulatory effects of a transcriptional activator and the basal factor TFE are exerted through non-overlapping mechanisms involving distinctive protein-protein interactions. The ability to assemble bacterial RNAP from its subunits in vitro has uniquely provided access to manipulations of structure that have generated important insights into transcription mechanisms (16Kuznedelov K.

The obvious desideratum of an in vitro assembled eukaryotic RNAP has not yet been achieved, but the assembly of the archaeal enzyme may point the way, while also opening new approaches to the dissection of the peculiarly mosaic archaeal transcription machinery.

Coding region mutations cause cardiac sudden death syndromes and conduction system failure. Polymorphisms in the 5′-sequence adjacent to the SCN5A gene have been linked to cardiac arrhythmias. We identified three alternative 5′-splice variants (1A, 1B, and 1C) of the untranslated exon 1 and two 3′-variants in the murine Scn5a mRNA. Two of the exon 1 isoforms (1B and 1C) were novel when compared with the published human and rat SCN5A sequences. Quantitative real time PCR results showed that the abundance of the isoforms varied during cardiac development. The 1A, 1B, and 1C mRNA splice variants increased 7.8 ± 1.7-fold (E1A), 6.0 ± 1.0-fold (E1B), and 20.6 ± 3.7-fold (E1C) from fetal to adult heart, respectively. Promoter deletion and luciferase reporter gene analysis using cardiac and skeletal muscle cell lines demonstrated a pattern of distinct cardiac-specific enhancer elements associated with exons 1A and 1C. In the case of exon 1C, the enhancer element appeared to be within the exon. A 5′-repressor preceded each cardiac enhancer element. We concluded that the murine Na+ channel has both 5′- and 3′-untranslated region mRNA variants that are developmentally regulated and that the promoter region contains two distinct cardiac-specific enhancer regions. The presence of homologous human splicing suggests that that these regions may be fruitful new areas of study in understanding cardiac sodium channel regulation and the genetic susceptibility to sudden death.

We identified three alternative 5′-splice variants (1A, 1B, and 1C) of the untranslated exon 1 and two 3′-variants in the murine Scn5a mRNA. Two of the exon 1 isoforms (1B and 1C) were novel when compared with the published human and rat SCN5A sequences. Quantitative real time PCR results showed that the abundance of the isoforms varied during cardiac development. The 1A, 1B, and 1C mRNA splice variants increased 7.8 ± 1.7-fold (E1A), 6.0 ± 1.0-fold (E1B), and 20.6 ± 3.7-fold (E1C) from fetal to adult heart, respectively. Promoter deletion and luciferase reporter gene analysis using cardiac and skeletal muscle cell lines demonstrated a pattern of distinct cardiac-specific enhancer elements associated with exons 1A and 1C. In the case of exon 1C, the enhancer element appeared to be within the exon. A 5′-repressor preceded each cardiac enhancer element. We concluded that the murine Na+ channel has both 5′- and 3′-untranslated region mRNA variants that are developmentally regulated and that the promoter region contains two distinct cardiac-specific enhancer regions. The presence of homologous human splicing suggests that that these regions may be fruitful new areas of study in understanding cardiac sodium channel regulation and the genetic susceptibility to sudden death. The voltage-sensitive sodium channel (Nav1.5) α-subunit is encoded by the SCN5A gene, and its product is the main determinant of Na+ influx and excitability in cardiac cells. In humans, mutations of the coding region cause sudden death syndromes such as long QT type 3 (1Bezzina C.R. Rook M.B. Wilde A.A.M. Cardiovasc.

Recent reports indicated that polymorphisms of sequences 5′ to the human SCN5A gene might contribute to cardiac arrhythmias in the general population (10Yang P. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The Nav1.5 sodium channel is prominently expressed in heart but has been detected also in prenatal skeletal muscle (11Kallen R.G.

All or parts of the cardiac SCN5A gene have been cloned from several species, including humans, rats, mice, cows, dogs, and guinea pigs. Each of these genes shows a high degree of homology. For example, between humans, rats, and mice, coding region homology is as high as 99%, and genomic structure is maintained in all species for which the sequences are known. Cardiac sodium channel dysfunction as the result of coding region mutations has been well described. Mutations can result in changes of the gating kinetics of the channel, expression level, and distribution pattern on the cell membrane (12Ou Y. Gibbons S.J. Miller S.M. Strege P.R. Rich A.

On the other hand, little is known about the transcriptional and translational regulation of SCN5A that seem to be important determinants of channel expression. One report suggesting the importance of this type of regulation showed that anti-arrhythmic drugs could up-regulate cardiac Na+ channel mRNA and subsequent current expression (14Kang J.X. Li Y.Y. Leaf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2724-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, heart failure and atrial fibrillation have been shown to reduce Na+ channel mRNA abundance (15Gaspo R. Bosch R.F. Bou-Abboud E. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1045-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 16Yue L.X. Melnyk P. Gaspo R. Wang Z.G. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and this may have a role in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The promoter regions of a few voltage-gated Na+ channels have been studied. These include the brain sodium channel II (SCN2A) (17Lu C.M. Eichelberger J.S. Beckman M.L. Schade S.D. Brown G.B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1998; 11: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 18Schade S.D. Brown C.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and one type of skeletal muscle sodium channel (rSkM2) (19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Zhang H. Maldonado M.N. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 85-103PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Yang et al. (10Yang P. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have described multiple transcription initiation sites in human SCN5A, but little else is known about the promoter region of this important channel. To investigate the regulatory elements of the Scn5a gene, we have isolated and characterized mouse genomic clones encoding the cardiac sodium channel. We identified multiple novel transcription start sites associated with three untranslated exon 1 splice variants. Also, we have identified two 3′-splice variants. The mRNA abundance of these splice variants was developmentally regulated. Promoter analysis revealed that there were two regions containing cardiac-specific elements. Each promoter region was preceded by repressor elements. Thus, the Scn5a gene showed a complex transcriptional regulation and the possibility of six mRNA variants, giving the opportunity of translational control. Transcriptional or translational alterations might contribute to variations in Na+ channel current and the risk for arrhythmia. Cloning of the Mouse Scn5a Gene—PCR primers RHI28F/R (Table I) were used to screen Down-To-The-Well 129sv/J mouse embryonic stem cell bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) 1The abbreviations used are: BAC, bacterial artificial chromosome; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TSS, transcription start site; Pa, promoter A; Pb, promoter B; UTR, untranslated region; RT, reverse transcription. DNA pools (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO). The primers were designed based upon the reported rat cardiac sodium channel gene exon 28 cDNA sequence (Gen-Bank™ accession number M27902). Two positive BAC clones on vector pBeloBAC11, GS 24810 and 24811, were found to contain Scn5a sequences. Sequencing the ends of BAC clone 24810 confirmed that this BAC contained a fragment of mouse chromosome 9. Subsequent sequencing of the entire region containing the Scn5a gene was carried out with a series of primers.Table IPCR PrimersPrimer pairOligo sequence (5′ to 3′) forward/reverse primersLocationApplicationRHI28F/RGCATGGCCAACTTCGCTTACGExon 28Screening BAC clone/CCGGGAGGTTATCACTGGTGSP5′primer/TGGTGGCACTGAACCGGAAGATGExon 3RACE-PCRGSP3′AGCGAGAGGGACTCATTGCCTACATExon 28RACE-PCRE1AFCCAAGCCCTACGCCGAACExon 1ART-PCRE1BFGCCCTGAGAGGAAGTGAAGCTExon 1BRT-PCRE1CFGCTGCCTCTATGCCTCAGCTTExon 1CRT-PCRrtpcr/R/TGGTGCCCCGAGGTAACAExon 2RT-PCREPF/RTGGATCTGGCAGGATTTCATAGTGPromoter APromoter analysis/CTTGCTTTGACCTGTACAGACTCGCAPF-KpnIggggtaccCCGTCGACATATGGAGCAGCGATGPromoter BPromoter analysis/APR-BgIII/gaagatctCACAGGCTCTCCTCAGGCTGCCTAHE1FAGTCTAGCTAGGGACGGTGCTGCExon 1CPromoter analysisAHI1FGGTTTGATTTGCACCTCTTGTGTGIntron 1CPromoter analysisHRE1FGCCGCTGAGCCTGCGCCCGCTGCExon 1APCRmE2R/CTTCTCATCCTGCTTCTGGGGGCAExon 2PCR Open table in a new tab Characterization of the 5′- and 3′-Ends of Scn5a Transcript by Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—Heart tissue from CD1 adult and 16-day postcoitum embryos was homogenized, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy minikit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods were used to characterize the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mouse Scn5a mRNA using a GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to remove the 5′-phosphates of the truncated mRNA and non-mRNA forms of total RNA. Tobacco acid pyrophosphatase was used to remove the 5′-cap structure from intact full-length mRNA, and T4 RNA ligase was used to add the GeneRacer RNA oligo to the 5′-end of the mRNA. The first strand cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcription using a reverse gene-specific primer GSP5′ (Table I) complementary to exon 3 of the mouse Scn5a gene and the GeneRacer oligo(dT) primer at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. The 5′- and 3′-end PCR reactions were performed with platinum Pfx DNA polymerase using 10 μm GSP5′ and the GeneRacer 5′-primer for amplifying the 5′-end fragment and using 10 μm the forward GSP3′ (Table I) complementary to exon 28 of the mouse Scn5a and the GeneRacer oligo(dT) primer to obtain the 3′-end. An additional PCR reaction with nested primers was performed. The nested PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm that the RACE-PCR products were from the Scn5a cDNA. For the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) splice variants, relative mRNA variant abundance was analyzed by gel densitometry of the PCR results using the Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to the abundance of β-actin. Primary DNA sequence analysis was performed with the Vector NTI 6 software (Informax, Frederick, MD). The sequences were aligned to mouse genomic DNA and cDNA sequences in the GenBank™ data base to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) and 3′-poly(A) sites. The presumptive promoter region was screened for CpG islands using the CPG-PLOT program and for transcription biding sites by using TFSEARCH. RT-PCR Assay for Quantification of Scn5a Transcripts—To determine the abundance of different cardiac cDNAs carrying variant exon 1 isoforms, total RNA from adult mice and 16-day postcoitum embryos were isolated using the RNeasy minikit with the addition of RNase-free DNase I. Reverse transcription was carried out at 37 °C for 1 h with Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen), 1 μg of total RNA, and 10 μm random hexamers (Roche Applied Science). The first strand cDNA was used as a template for subsequent PCR. Each PCR reaction contained 12.5 μl of QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit master mix (Qiagen) and 2.5 μm primer pairs in a total 25-μl reaction volume. The forward primers for exon 1 variants were E1AF (exon 1A), E1BF (exon 1B), and E1CF (exon 1C), respectively (Table I). The reverse primer rtpcr/R (Table I) was constant in each case. The reactions gave rise to 158-, 104-, and 103-bp PCR products, respectively. All amplifications were performed in triplicate and consisted of 50 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C in a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) thermocycler iCycler. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. β-Actin was used as a reference when making quantitative comparisons. Promoter-Reporter Constructs—Because of the total length of the region (>15 kb), two contiguous Scn5a promoter regions were amplified separately by PCR using the primer pairs EPF/EPR and APF-KpnI/APR-BglII (Table I) using TaqPlus Maxx DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to obtain GC-rich PCR products with high sensitivity and fidelity. BAC clone 24810 was used as a template. The primers EPF/EPR produced a 3.4-kb amplicon referred to as promoter A (Pa). A SacII-KpnI digest representing nearly the entire Pa amplicon was cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned into the KpnI-SacI sites of the pGL3-basic vector designated as pGL3-PaKSI containing the fragment from –18.71 to –15.53 kb of the Scn5a gene (the first base pair of the start codon is referred to as +1). A series of restriction enzyme digestions with KpnI combined with BstEII, NsiI, AscI, and PstI and blunt ligation after pretreatment by mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) created the different promoter A reporter constructs, pGL3-PaBSI (–17.81 to –15.53 kb), pGL3-PaNSI (–16.96 to –15.53 kb), pGL3-ASI (–16.50 to –15.53 kb), and pGL3-PaPSI (–16.16 to –15.53 kb), respectively, and digestion with AscI and SacI and blunt end ligation after mung bean nuclease digest created a promoter A fragment from –16.50 to –15.93 kb referred to as pGL3-PaKA. The primer pair APF-KpnI/APR-BglII (Table I) generated a 3.0-kb DNA fragment referred as to promoter B (Pb) containing –2161 to –24 bp upstream of ATG. This fragment was cloned into the KpnI-BglII sites of the luciferase reporter plasmid, pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI) and was named pGL3-Pb3.0KB. The primer pairs AHE1F/APR (–855 to –24 bp) and AHI1F/APR (from intron –664 to –24 bp) were used to amplify Pb0.8 (containing exon 1C) and Pb0.6 (not containing exon 1C), respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO and subcloned into pGL3-basic at the KpnI and XhoI sites. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—The rat embryonic cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2 (ATCC catalog number CRL-1446) and the murine skeletal myoblast cell line C2C12 (gift from Dr. Roy Sutliff) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum under standard tissue culture conditions at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized at 70–80% confluence, and 2.5 × 105 cells were plated in each well of 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Transfection of 3.0 μg of each promoter-reporter construct and 0.1 μgof the Rous sarcoma virus-driven β-galactosidase-expressing plasmid (RSVβ-gal, Promega, Madison, WI) was carried out with 10 μl of Polyfect or Superfect chemical transfection reagents (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h, the cells were treated with lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and cell extracts were collected for analysis of luciferase and β-galactosidase activity using 100 μl of luciferase assay substrate (Promega, Madison, WI) and 100 μl of Galacto-Star substrate (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA). Light emission was quantified in an automated luminometer using PlateReader 3.0 software (Packard Instrument Co.). The constructs pGL3-control (promoter and enhancer) and pGL3-basic (promoterless) were used in all transfection experiments as positive and negative controls, respectively. Transfection efficiency of the reporter constructs was controlled by comparison to β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity of all of the promoter constructs was normalized to a pGL3-basic promoterless control. At least three separate transfection sessions were employed, and at each session, transfections were performed in triplicate. Three luciferase/β-galactosidase readings were taken for each transfection experiment. All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis of mean values was carried out using Student's paired or unpaired t tests. Isolation of Mouse Cardiac Scn5a Genomic Clones—PCR screening of the mouse BAC library for exon 28 of Scn5a identified two genomic BAC clones containing mouse cardiac sodium channel sequences. Southern blotting and sequencing confirmed the presence of Scn5a. BAC clone 24810 was used in all experiments as the genomic DNA template. Sequencing starting at flanking BAC vector sites established the presence of the entire Scn5a genomic DNA fragment with 87 kb of 5′- and 20 kb of 3′-flanking sequences. The Scn5a gene itself was ∼100 kb in length, including the 5′- and 3′-UTRs. Identification of Three 5′- and Two 3′-UTR Splice Variants—In both humans and rats, Northern analysis shows that the SCN5A mRNA size is ∼ 8.5 kb (19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Zhang H. Maldonado M.N. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 85-103PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gellens M.E. George A.L. Chen L.Q. Chahine M. Horn R. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The first mouse Scn5a cDNA for this channel (GenBank™ accession number AJ271477) was 6.5 kb, with a 5′-end extending only to 50 bp upstream of the ATG codon and a 348-bp 3′-UTR, which is considerably shorter than published human and rat UTRs. Therefore, we undertook to evaluate whether the previously reported mouse UTR sequences represented the full extent of the mouse clone. The RACE procedure was employed to the 5′- and 3′-mRNA ends upstream of the start codon and downstream of the stop codon, respectively. PCR amplification of cDNA yielded several distinct bands on gel electrophoresis. Subsequent nested PCR amplification gave two bands (500 and 200 bp) in fetal heart RNA and one band (380 bp) in adult heart RNA (Fig. 1). Sequences of these bands showed that the 500- and 380-bp bands were Scn5a gene-specific. A comparison between the 5′-RACE-PCR products and genomic sequences showed that there were two different exon 1 isoforms; one was 368 bp and located 15.3 kb upstream of exon 2. Another isoform was 269 or 197 bp and was separated by only 610 bp from exon 2. From the RACE procedure, we were unable to obtain the exon 1 isoform reported previously (22Shang L.J. Dudley S.C. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 424AGoogle Scholar), suggesting that a total of three exon 1 splice variants existed. This possibility was confirmed by PCR using the primers HRE1F and mE2R (Table I), producing a 97-bp exon 1 isoform located 454 bp upstream of the 368-bp exon. We named these untranslated cDNA fragments, exon 1A (97 bp), exon 1B (368 bp), and exon 1C (269 or 197 bp), respectively. Exon 1A, identified by primer extension and RNase protection, has been reported previously in human and rat (9Watson J. Haites N.E. Dean J.C.S. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: S82Google Scholar, 18Schade S.D. Brown C.B. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 81: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) with a length ranging from 97 to 176 bp (10Yang P. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Of the sequences containing exon 1A reported in the Gen-Bank™, no full-length clones were obtained using RACE methods. There are several possible explanations for the failure of 5′-RACE analysis to identify this exon 1 variant. One possibility is that the high GC content and low CpG frequency within 3 kb of the 5′-flanking region generated a complex secondary structure that impeded polymerase activity. We observed several short GC-rich (>60%) stretches upstream of each of the Scn5a exon 1 sequences, but the frequency of CpG was unexpectedly low. Nevertheless, RACE tends to be insensitive to high GC content. Another possibility is that the full-length mRNA is easily truncated, and in this case, the commercial kits such as the one we used would be unable to amplify the full sequence. This idea is consistent with the finding of multiple TSSs by the previously mentioned alternative methods (23Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is possible that these represent various truncations rather than unique TSSs. Analysis of the 3′-UTR showed evidence of splice variations in fetal and adult heart. By RACE-PCR using GSP3′- and oligo(dT) primers (Table I), we identified two alternative 3′-UTRs (Fig. 1C). Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that the 3′-UTRs had two different poly(A) splicing variants. One was short, 347 bp after the stop codon, and was consistent with the published mouse Scn5a cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AJ271477). Additionally, there was a second, long variant of 2176 bp, which corresponded to the human SCN5A cDNA 5′-UTR (GenBank™ accession number NM_198056). A summary of the findings is presented in Fig. 2. 5′- and 3′-UTR Splice Variants Are Developmentally Regulated—Nav1.5 expression is developmentally regulated (11Kallen R.G. Sheng Z.H. Yang J. Chen L.Q. Rogart R.B. Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1990; 4: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 24Donahue L.M. Coates P.W. Lee V.H. Ippensen D.C. Arze S.E. Poduslo S.E. Brain Res. 2000; 887: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Splice variants in the 5′-UTR are known to regulate expression during development and formation of tissues (25Ye X. Fong P. Iizuka N. Choate D. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26Zogopoulos G. Nathanielsz P. Hendy G.N. Goodyer C.G. J. Mol.

Therefore, we investigated whether our identified, novel 5′-UTR isoforms varied during development, a prerequisite for their contribution to the observed regulation of expression. We employed real time PCR to analyze the relative abundance of the Scn5a mRNA splice variants. Real time PCR results indicated that the abundance of each exon 1 isoform increased 7.8 ± 1.7-fold (n = 8), 6.0 ± 1.0-fold (n = 8), and 20.6 ± 3.7-fold (n = 8) (Fig. 3A) in the adult relative to the respective fetal heart abundance. Using exon 1A as a standard, exon 1A, 1B, and 1C mRNA abundance was 1.0 ± 0.1-fold (n = 8), 1.3 ± 0.2-fold (n = 8), and 0.5 ± 0.1-fold (n = 8) in fetal heart and 1.0 ± 0.2-fold (n = 8), 1.0 ± 0.2-fold (n = 8), and 1.2 ± 0.2-fold (n = 8) in adult heart, respectively (Fig. 3B). Exon 1C was the least abundant in fetal heart and increased the most with development. In adult heart, the relative mRNA abundance of the isoforms was statistically equivalent. The 3′-UTR length was also developmentally regulated. As shown in Fig. 1C, both the short and long forms of the 3′-UTR were present in fetal and adult heart. Analyzed by densitometry relative to β-actin, there was no statistical change in the amount of the long form, but the abundance of the short form was reduced in adult heart by 62% (p < 0.01) compared with that in fetal heart (Fig. 3C). Functional Analysis of the Scn5a Promoter Region—Nav1.5 shows tissue-specific restriction predominately limited to cardiac and skeletal muscle. Expression is relatively low in skeletal muscle when compared with Nav1.4 encoded by Scn4a. To help understand the origin of this tissue specificity, we constructed plasmids containing different 5′-regions of the Scn5a gene inserted upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. Because of its size, we divided the 5′-region and analyzed reporter constructs based upon two regions encompassing the entire putative promoter (Fig. 4, A and B). The luciferase activities of these constructs were compared after transient transfection into cardiac (H9c2) and skeletal muscle (C2C12) cell lines. In all experiments, the transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting with the plasmid pRSV-β-gal, which contained the β-galactosidase gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Successive deletions in the promoter region revealed that exons 1A and 1C had associated elements that conferred increased activity in the heart cell line. Elements associated with exon 1B but not 1C enhanced expression in the skeletal muscle. Fragment Pb0.8 (–855 to –24), containing exon 1C, showed the strongest promoter activity in the H9c2 cells (129.3 ± 6.0 relative light units). Core promoter sequences are shown in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Nucleotide sequences of the mouse Scn5a core promoters.A, the sequence region comprising the AscI-SacI fragment of the first promoter, containing exon 1A and part of exon 1B (the full exon 1B sequence included).

In the case of heart, the SCN5A gene encodes the vast majority of Na+ current. The encoded Nav1.5 channel is the target of many anti-arrhythmic drugs, and mutations in the channel coding sequence yield sudden death syndromes. In mice and humans, Nav1.5 is developmentally regulated, expressed predominately in cardiac and skeletal muscle, and varies during disease (15Gaspo R. Bosch R.F. Bou-Abboud E. Nattel S. Circ.

Despite its physiological importance, little is known about the transcriptional or translational regulation of this gene. Here, we report that the mouse Scn5a gene encodes for three mutually exclusive untranslated exon 1 variants and two different 3′-untranslated regions. This allows for the possibility of six different Scn5a mRNAs (Fig. 2B). Because 3′- and 5′-UTRs are important in controlling mRNA stability, cellular and subcellular localization, and translation activation or repression (30Curtis D. Lehmann R. Zamore P.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 171-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 31Hake L.E. Richter J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: M31-M38PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that these sequence variations can contribute to the variable expression of Nav1.5. Consistent with playing a regulatory role in Na+ current, the splice variants differ in relative abundance during development, with a prominent up-regulation of exon 1C and down-regulation of the short 3′-UTR mRNA forms in an adult compared with a fetal heart. The long Scn5a 5′-flanking sequence has the features of TATA-less and TATA-plus promoters and has multiple sites for initiation of transcription, suggesting the possibility of complex transcriptional and translational regulation. The long Scn5a 5′-UTR is similar to other growth factors, proto-oncogenes, transfactors, and ion channel genes, which also show long 5′-UTRs (32Bremner H.R. Freywald T. O'Brodovich H.M. Otulakowski G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L124-L134Google Scholar). These 5′-UTRs often show multiple transcription start sites, as does the Scn5a gene (19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We identified two TSSs associated with exon 1C (Fig. 4B). Previously, three TSSs have been identified in the human SCN5A gene in sequences preceding our exon 1A (10Yang P. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nine potential TSSs have been identified in rat muscle (19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Adding the possibility of more complex regulation, the total identified promoter region contained consensus binding sites for several transcription factors that may be functionally important, including Sp-1, GATA-1, AML-1a, Lyf-1, c-Myc, v-Myc, and Est-1. The H9c2 heart and C2C12 skeletal muscle cell lines allowed us to investigate the tissue-specific effects of potential regulatory sequences on reporter expression. The Pa-PSI fragment enhanced reporter expression in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. This region had been shown previously to enhance rSkM2 expression in the L6 skeletal muscle cell line (19Sheng Z.H. Zhang H. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our results with the fragments Pa-ASI and Pa-ASII were similar to those seen with the analogous human SCN5A promoter region expressed in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes (10Yang P. Kupershmidt S. Roden D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 20Zhang H. Maldonado M.N. Barchi R.L. Kallen R.G. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 85-103PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter regions associated with exons 1A and 1C conferred increased expression of the reporter in a cardiac cell line. Sequence analysis showed GATA-4, Nkx2.5, CCAC, and MyoD transcription factor binding sites preceding exons 1A and 1C, consistent with transcription of these variants in cardiac development (33Stennard F.A. Costa M.W. Elliott D.A. Rankin S. Haast S.J.P. Lai D. McDonald L.P.A. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Bruneau B.G. Zorn A.M. Harvey R.P. Dev. Biol. 2003; 262: 206-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). There were C-ets-1 transcription factor binding sites in the repressor segments preceding the cardiac-specific enhancer elements (27van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that exon 1B and its preceding segments may be most important for skeletal muscle expression of Scn5a. Because cell lines were used, these results may differ in native cells but suggest the possibility of complex transcriptional regulation with two cardiac-specific promoter regions. In conclusion, our results suggest the possibility of complex transcriptional and translational regulation of the cardiac sodium channel. The Scn5a promoter region is large and complex including repressor elements, tissue-specific promoter elements, and three untranslated exon 1 variants. The abundance of alternatively spliced exon 1 and 3′-UTR mRNAs varied with development. Whereas these studies were conducted in mice, sequence comparison and preliminary data indicate that the human SCN5A gene is organized in an analogous way. It is likely that complex genetic regulation contributes to alteration of the Nav1.5 current during development and disease and may be a fruitful area of exploration in inherited arrhythmic syndromes that cannot be explained by coding region mutations."

We have determined that ILK regulates U2OS osteosarcoma cell spreading and motility in a manner requiring both kinase activity and localization. Overexpression of wild-type (WT) ILK resulted in suppression of cell spreading, polarization, and motility to fibronectin. Cell lines overexpressing kinase-dead (S343A) or paxillin binding site mutant ILK proteins display inhibited haptotaxis to fibronectin. Conversely, spreading and motility was potentiated in cells expressing the “dominant negative,” non-targeting, kinase-deficient E359K ILK protein. Suppression of cell spreading and motility of WT ILK U2OS cells could be rescued by treatment with the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 or introduction of dominant negative ROCK or RhoA, suggesting these cells have increased RhoA signaling. Activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a negative regulator of RhoA, was reduced in WT ILK cells, whereas overexpression of FAK rescued the observed defects in spreading and cell polarity. Thus, ILK-dependent effects on ROCK and/or RhoA signaling may be mediated through FAK.

Interactions between cells and their surrounding extracellular matrix influence multiple aspects of cellular function, including mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, cytoskeletal organization, motility, and survival (1Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). These cell-extracellular matrix associations also regulate physiologic and pathologic processes such as development, differentiation, and metastasis. Adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated by the integrin family of transmembrane receptors and results in integrin clustering into multimolecular complexes termed focal adhesions. These sites serve as a physical linkage between the cellular cytoskeleton and the surrounding matrix and contain numerous structural and signaling components (2Geiger B. Bershadsky A. Pankov R.

ILK comprises four amino-terminal ankyrin repeats, a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain, and a central pleckstrin homology domain, which binds phosphoinositides to regulate ILK function (7Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The first ankyrin domain mediates the association of ILK with the LIM-only adaptor protein PINCH, a component of growth factor receptor signaling and actin reorganization pathways (5Li F. Zhang Y.

The kinase activity of ILK has been reported to be both inhibited and stimulated following integrin ligation to a fibronectin matrix (6Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G.

A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In many studies a putative “dominant negative” ILK mutant (E359K) has been utilized as a protein that lacks kinase activity; however, subsequent work has reported only modest or insignificant reductions in kinase activity (10Yamaji S. Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Koide Y. Yoshida M. Kanamori H. Mohri H. Ohno S. Ishigatsubo Y. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1251-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V.

Rather, a block in paxillin binding and ILK localization to focal adhesions is associated with the E359K mutation (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Further, studies in ILK-null systems in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans have raised questions regarding the role of ILK kinase activity in cellular regulation (20Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 787-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), suggesting perhaps a more dominant role for ILK as a molecular scaffold. Importantly, loss of ILK, as studied in null model systems, results in profound defects in integrin-actin linkages associated with muscle adhesion structures, which are homologous to focal adhesions (20Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 21Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr.

Docheva D. Grashoff C. Sakai K. Kostka G. Braun A. Pfeifer A. Yurchenco P.D. Fassler R. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the E359K mutant is able to localize to adhesive structures and rescue defects in these ILK-null backgrounds (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Zervas C.G. Gregory S.L. Brown N.H. J.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Consequently, although ILK function is clearly a critical component of the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and integrin-based adhesion complexes, it is uncertain whether ILK function is dependent upon kinase activity, adaptor function, discrete subcellular localization, or a combination thereof. Cytoskeletal reorganization in response to integrin activation is dependent upon the Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA, and coordinated regulation of these molecules is essential for the processes of cell spreading and motility (24Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar, 25Hall A. Nobes C.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and Rac1 orchestrate filopodia and lamellipodia formation, respectively, which are necessary for efficient membrane protrusion and cell spreading, whereas RhoA is the primary mediator of cellular contractility, stress fiber formation, and establishment of prominent focal adhesions (25Hall A. Nobes C.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). A principal effector of RhoA is Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which modulates the actin cytoskeleton through pathways involving myosin phosphatase and LIM-kinase (26Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). ROCK has been shown to both positively and negatively regulate motility, depending upon cellular context (27Besson A. Gurian-West M. Schmidt A. Hall A. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 862-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar, 29Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that ILK contributes to the regulation of cytoskeletal organization, morphology, and cell migration through a ROCK-mediated pathway. Coordination of ILK activity and subcellular localization are critical for cell morphology, spreading, and motility. The wild-type (WT) ILK-dependent effects on spreading, morphology, and motility were reversed by inhibition of either RhoA signaling or its downstream effector ROCK. Furthermore, WT ILK-expressing cells exhibited a deficiency in normal integrin-mediated activation of FAK that may account for the increased RhoA/ROCK signaling. These findings provide a novel link between ILK function and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton that extends our understanding of the role for ILK in regulation of cell migration, an event essential for cellular development and transformation. Antibodies and Materials—Human plasma fibronectin was purchased from Sigma or BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibody to actopaxin has been described previously (30Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J.

The ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 was obtained from Calbiochem. DNA Constructs—Wild-type ROCK, constitutively active ROCK (Δ1, lacking the carboxyl-terminal pleckstrin homology and cysteine-rich domains), and dominant negative ROCK (KD-IA, kinase defective and negative for Rho binding) constructs were kindly provided by S. Narumiya (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) (31Itoh K. Yoshioka K. Akedo H. Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 32Ishizaki T.

GFP-ILK WT, E359K, and paxillin binding subdomain (PBS) mutant V386G/T387G constructs were as described previously (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). GFP-ILK containing a serine to alanine mutation at residue 343 (S343A) was constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The presence of each mutation was confirmed by sequencing at Cornell BioResource Center (Ithaca, NY). Rac1 and RhoA pEXV vectors were provided by Marc Symons (North Shore-LIJ Research Institute, Manhasset, NY) and subcloned into pcDNA3. DsRed was obtained from Clontech. Hemagglutinin antigen-tagged avian wild-type FAK construct was a generous gift of J. L. Guan (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Establishment of Cell Lines—U2OS osteosarcoma cells were transfected with GFP-tagged ILK constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Clonal cell lines were generated by selection in 1 mg/ml G418 essentially as described previously (33Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 and 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO). Spreading and Motility Assays—U2OS cells were detached, maintained in suspension for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and then replated on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. Coverslips were subsequently fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at the indicated time points and processed as described previously (34Brown M.C. West K.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1550-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence photomicrographs were captured with a Spot RT slider charge-coupled device camera (Diagnostic Imaging, Livingston, Scotland) attached to a Zeiss Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) fitted with a 50-watt mercury lamp and 63× 1.45 numerical aperture Neofluar oil immersion objective. Images were processed and cell areas quantified using Spot version 3.0 software and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Boyden migration assays were performed essentially as described previously using Neuroprobe 96-well chambers (Cabin John, MD) (35Riedy M.C. Brown M.C. Molloy C.J. Turner C.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FAK Activation—Cells were placed in suspension and respread as described above. Cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to 0.45-μm supported nitrocellulose (Millipore), and analyzed by Western blotting with either FAK phospho-tyrosine 397 or pan FAK antibodies. x/y Morphology Analysis—Immunofluorescence was performed as described above. Direction of migration was then determined for each cell based on previous analysis of morphology of U2OS cells during migration (data not shown). The y value was designated to be the length in microns from the leading edge to the tail, and the x value was the distance from the leftmost to the rightmost edge of the cell, perpendicular to the y-axis. The x/y ratio for each cell was scored as one of three conditions: x > y, which was designated +1 and denoted a crescent-shaped cell typical of migrating U2OS parental cells; x = y, which was designated 1 and denoted a round cell; and x < y, which was designated –1 and denoted an elongated fibroblastic-like morphology. Characterization of Focal Adhesion Localization of ILK Mutants—To investigate a role for ILK in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration, we established U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines stably expressing GFP-tagged WT and mutant forms of ILK. We utilized a mutant that is reported to eliminate ILK-associated kinase activity (S343A) (7Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), a PBS mutant that cannot bind to paxillin and thus cannot target to focal adhesions but has wild-type levels of associated kinase activity (9Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the widely used but poorly characterized E359K mutant (36Persad S. Attwell S.

Western immunoblot analysis confirmed equivalent levels of expression of each of the GFP-ILK constructs (Fig. 1A), as well as endogenous FAK and actopaxin (Fig. 1A). An initial survey of these GFP-ILK-expressing U2OS cell lines confirmed localization of WT ILK to focal adhesions, whereas the E359K and PBS ILK mutants failed to localize to these structures, as reported previously (Fig. 1B) (4Nikolopoulos S.N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 1568-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the kinase-dead S343A ILK mutant exhibited robust focal adhesion localization, indicating kinase activity is not required for subcellular localization (Fig. 1B). The existence of focal adhesions in all of these cells was established by staining with an antibody to paxillin (data not shown). An examination of actin organization revealed only minor differences among cell lines (Fig. 1B). All results were confirmed using multiple clones of each ILK mutant. ILK Inhibits Cell Spreading and Polarization on Fibronectin—ILK has been implicated in mediating integrin signaling during cell attachment (6Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 7Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of ILK expression on cell spreading and morphology in U2OS cells, WT and mutant ILK cell lines were respread on 10 μg/ml fibronectin for 30, 60, and 120 min followed by quantitation of cell areas. The WT cells spread less effectively than parental cells at all time points, reaching one-half the size of the parental cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, the E359K ILK cells spread more rapidly and reached 1.3–1.5-fold the area of parental cells (Fig. 2B). The S343A and the PBS ILK cell lines displayed slightly elevated spreading at the 60-min time point (Fig. 2B). However, this increase was lost by the 120-min time point, when the S343A and PBS ILK cells had essentially attained the same areas as parental cells. During the first 120 min of spreading, parental U2OS cells transitioned from a non-polarized round shape to a highly polarized crescent phenotype (Fig. 2A). In striking contrast, the WT ILK cells failed to acquire a similar morphology and instead became elongated. Conversely, the E359K, PBS, and S343A ILK cells were able to attain a crescent morphology similar to parental cells (Fig. 2A). These differences were quantified using x/y ratios as outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” with round cells denoted “1,” wide crescent cells denoted “+1,” and elongated cells denoted “–1” (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B demonstrates that the morphological transition to a crescent morphology (+1) occurs between 60 and 120 min of adhesion to fibronectin in all of the ILK mutant cell lines (Fig. 3B). Notably, at 60 min both the PBS and E359K ILK cell lines had a decreased percentage of crescent-shaped cells (+1) that returned to parental levels by the 120-min time point (Fig. 3B). Importantly, U2OS cells expressing WT ILK remained elongated throughout the time course of spreading (Fig. 3B). Overall, these results indicate that the WT ILK-expressing cells have a defect in attaining the normal polarized crescent phenotype that occurs in the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line. That the E359K, PBS, and S343A ILK cells are competent to polarize into the normal crescent phenotype suggests the altered morphological transition exhibited by WT ILK cells requires both localization and ILK-associated kinase activity. ILK Inhibits Fibronectin Haptotaxis—Previous studies using a putative ILK kinase inhibitor and the E359K ILK mutant suggest that ILK kinase activity is a necessary component of motility in prostate cancer cell lines (11Attwell S. Mills J. Troussard A. Wu C. Dedhar S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4813-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine the role of ILK in motility in the U2OS cell lines, modified Boyden chamber migration assays to fibronectin were performed (Fig. 4). WT ILK cell motility was impaired relative to parental cells, whereas E359K ILK cellular motility was potentiated. Interestingly, the PBS mutant and S343A ILK cell lines each displayed decreased motility to fibronectin relative to parental cells. Conversely, a combined loss of targeting and reduction in kinase activity potentiated motility as evidenced by a motile gain-of-function in the E359K ILK cell line. These data demonstrate that negative regulation of fibronectin haptotaxis by ILK is a complex balance of kinase activity and localization-dependent effects. We next performed Boyden assays with 10 ng/ml IGF-II in the bottom chamber to evaluate the ability of these cells to respond to chemoattractant and undergo chemotaxis. Interestingly, WT ILK cells migrated as efficiently as parental cells (Fig. 4), whereas the PBS and S343A ILK cell lines were unresponsive to growth factor presence and continued to exhibit a profound defect in cell motility. In addition, E359K ILK cells were unable to increase motility above the elevated baseline in response to IGF-II, suggesting that these cells migrate at their maximum rate. These data suggest that ILK activity is required for normal responsiveness to growth factor receptor-mediated signaling through integrins. Role for Rho Family p21 GTPases in ILK-dependent Cell Spreading and Polarization—The spreading characteristics of the WT and E359K ILK cell lines were consistent with a role for ILK in regulating Rho family GTPase signaling. Specifically, the WT ILK cells exhibited a more RhoA-like phenotype with reduced lamellipodia, whereas the E359K ILK cells developed and sustained broad lamellipodia consistent with an elevation in Rac1 signaling. To directly determine the influence of Rac1 and RhoA activity on the phenotype of U2OS cells, active and negative versions of these p21 GTPases were introduced into parental cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, the constitutively active RhoA (G14V) construct produced an elongated morphology, which is a phenocopy of the morphology exhibited by WT ILK cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, introduction of constitutively active Rac1 (G12V) created an exaggerated, large, crescent-shaped phenotype (Fig. 5A) similar to cells expressing the E359K ILK mutant. A crescent phenotype is also observed in parental cells transfected with dominant negative RhoA (T19N) (Fig. 5A). Cells transfected with a dominant negative Rac1 (T17N) construct fail to spread, which is consistent with several previous reports (Fig. 5A) (37Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The ability of these Rac1 and RhoA constructs to modulate the phenotypes of the WT and E359K ILK cells was evaluated next. Dominant negative (T19N) RhoA and active (G12V) Rac1 expression rescued the WT ILK phenotype, indicating that WT ILK effects are upstream of Rho (Fig. 5B). These results may also indicate an inhibition of Rac signaling by WT ILK. In addition, negative Rac1 or active RhoA suppressed the increased spreading of the E359K ILK cells (data not shown), indicating that this effect of mutant ILK expression is upstream of Rho family activation. ILK Effects on Morphology and Spreading on Fibronectin Are ROCK-dependent—Because elevated RhoA signaling is implicated in the WT ILK phenotype, the role of the Rho downstream effector ROCK was examined (26Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). This serine/threonine kinase is a direct effector of RhoA and alters actin dynamics and cell contractility through both inhibition of myosin phosphatase and activation of the LIM kinase/cofilin pathway (26Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar). GFP-ILK-expressing cell lines were treated with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and respread on fibronectin followed by quantitative analysis of cell morphology (Fig. 6) (38Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2507) Google Scholar). Consistent with the dominant negative RhoA data above, inhibition of ROCK rescued the crescent phenotype in WT ILK cells. Importantly, measurements of x/y ratios confirmed a complete reversion of morphology in the WT ILK cells by this inhibitor, whereas Y-27632 treatment of parental or E359K ILK cells was without effect (Fig. 6B). A role for ROCK in ILK-dependent morphology was further evaluated through the expression of dominant negative and constitutively active ROCK constructs. Introducing inactive, dominant negative ROCK reverted the WT ILK phenotype to a crescent morphology, similar to parental cells (Fig. 7). In addition, constitutively active ROCK converted the E359K ILK crescent phenotype to a morphology similar to the WT ILK cells (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that the overexpression of WT ILK amplifies signaling through the ROCK pathway, whereas a dominant negative ILK construct, the E359K, diminishes this signaling as compared with parental U2OS cells. ROCK Inhibition Rescues the WT ILK Fibronectin Haptotaxis Defect—We next investigated whether the inhibition of ROCK would rescue the cell motility defect exhibited by WT ILK expression. Fibronectin haptotaxis assays were performed in the presence of 6 μm Y-27632. As shown in Fig. 8, ROCK inhibition normalized the motility between the WT ILK cells and the parental U2OS cells,"
https://openalex.org/W2031009502,"Delta1 acts as a membrane-bound ligand that interacts with the Notch receptor and plays a critical role in cell fate specification. By using peptide affinity chromatography followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified Dlg1 as a partner of the Delta1 C-terminal region. Dlg1 is a human homolog of the Drosophila Discs large tumor suppressor, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family of molecular scaffolds. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments between endogenous Dlg1 and transduced Delta1 in a 3T3 cell line stably expressing Delta1. Moreover, we showed that deletion of a canonical C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (ATEV) in Delta1 abrogated this interaction. Delta4 also interacted with Dlg1, whereas Jagged1, another Notch ligand, did not. In HeLa cells, transfected Delta1 triggered the accumulation of endogenous Dlg1 at sites of cell-cell contact. Expression of Delta1 also reduced the motility of 3T3 cells. Finally, deletion of the ATEV motif totally abolished these effects but did not interfere with the ability of Delta1 to induce Notch signaling and T cell differentiation in co-culture experiments. These results point to a new, probably cell-autonomous function of Delta1, which is independent of its activity as a Notch ligand.

Notch receptors and their ligands are essential in many binary cell fate decisions in various tissues from worm to vertebrates. Mechanisms through which Notch signaling regulates cell fate include lateral inhibition and inductive signaling (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The Notch gene that encodes a type I transmembrane protein was first identified in Drosophila, and in mammals four Notch paralogs have been isolated (2Robey E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In fly the two structurally related Notch ligands, Delta and Serrate, have both redundant and nonredundant functions (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar, 3Zeng C.Y. Youngershepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Notch ligands are conserved in vertebrates and include the Serrate orthologs Jagged-1 and -2 and the Delta orthologs Delta-1, -3, and -4 (4Fleming R.J. Purcell K. Artavanis-Tsakonas S.

The plurality of Notch ligands and receptors may account for the functional diversity of Notch signaling. All Notch ligands are single pass transmembrane polypeptides, and their intracellular domains vary in length and do not display any significant sequence similarity except at their very C-terminal end. In Xenopus and mammals several lines of evidence suggest that the intracellular domain of Delta is required for its normal function (6Chitnis A. Henrique D. Lewis J. Ish H.D. Kintner C.

The extracellular domain of the Notch ligands interacts with the Notch receptors expressed on adjacent cells and consists of multiple highly conserved epidermal growth factor-like motifs and a conserved DSL domain. No specificity of a ligand for a given Notch receptor has been demonstrated so far, and the transcriptional program elicited by a given Notch/ligand interaction has not been investigated either (9Brenner M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1210-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the Notch receptor undergoes two proteolytic cleavages (10Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O.

Notch ligands have been shown to constitutively undergo the same two proteolytic events that affect the receptor during activation. They are first cleaved by a metalloprotease of the ADAM family, resulting in the shedding of the extracellular region (16Mishra-Gorur K. Rand M.D. Perez-Villamil B. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We and others (17Six E. Ndiaye D. Laabi Y. Brou C. Gupta-Rossi N. Israel A. Logeat F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The function of Notch ligands in the emitting cell remains to be determined, both for the full-length molecule and the cleavage products. Comparative analysis of their intracellular amino acid sequences (Fig. 1) reveals a highly conserved ATEV motif at the C-terminal end of the Delta molecules, which corresponds to a canonical PDZ 1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1; Dlg1, Discs large homolog 1; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; MIG, MSCV-IRES-GFP; PBM, PDZ-binding motif; CHAPS, 3-[(3-chol-amidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot; IF, immunofluorescence; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MS, mass spectrometry; FCS, fetal calf serum; APC, allophycocyanin; HSC, hematopoietic stem cells.1The abbreviations used are: PDZ, PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1; Dlg1, Discs large homolog 1; MAGUK, membrane-associated guanylate kinase; MIG, MSCV-IRES-GFP; PBM, PDZ-binding motif; CHAPS, 3-[(3-chol-amidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; IB, immunoblot; IF, immunofluorescence; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MS, mass spectrometry; FCS, fetal calf serum; APC, allophycocyanin; HSC, hematopoietic stem cells. (PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1)-binding motif (21Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). This motif differs from Jagged PDZ-binding motif (PBM) and could be a binding site for specific partners that might regulate the cis or trans activity of the ligands (or both). Ascano et al. (22Ascano J.M. Beverly L.J. Capobianco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8771-8779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have recently shown that Jagged1 interacts with the PDZ domain of AF6, the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Canoe, and they proposed a bi-directional signaling model according to which Notch ligands would signal both in trans through Notch receptors located on adjacent cells and in cis in the emitting cell itself. We undertook a proteomic approach to identify proteins interacting with the cytoplasmic region of Delta1 based on peptide affinity chromatography. Here we report the identification of Dlg1 as an interacting partner for the PDZ-binding motif of Delta1. Dlg1 is a human homolog of the product of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor gene and is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family of scaffolding proteins. Dlg1 is essential for the assembly of multiprotein complexes at cell-cell junctions and is involved in maintenance of cell adhesion, cell polarity, growth control, and cell invasion (23Humbert P. Russell S. Richardson H. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 542-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Delta1 recruits Dlg1 at cell-cell contacts, thereby resulting in the association of Delta1 with a signaling complex, eventually leading to specific cellular effects in the emitting or in the receiving cell. Deletion of the four C-terminal residues encompassing the Delta1 PDZ-binding motif abolished the Delta1/Dlg1 interaction but did not affect Notch activation in a T cell differentiation assay. However, this mutation abolished the inhibitory activity that Delta1 exerts in cis on the motility of 3T3 cells, suggesting that Delta ligands somehow control cell motility through interaction with cytoskeletal proteins such as Dlg1. Affinity Purification Procedure—A crude membrane fraction (in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40), prepared from 1010 HeLa cells (as described in Brou et al. (10Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A. Israël A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 207-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar)), was diluted two times with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol and applied to a column containing 5 ml of Affi-Gel-15 resin (Bio-Rad). The flow-through was then loaded, overnight at 4 °C, onto a Delta peptide resin (5 mg of peptide LSAEKDECVIATEV per ml of Affi-Gel-15 coupled according to the manufacturer's protocol) and onto a control peptide resin with a similar pI (5 mg of peptide TEVKEDSAYGSQSVE per ml of Affi-Gel-15). The resins were washed extensively with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol. Bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 2 m NaCl. Column eluates were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Criterion XT gel 4-12%, Bio-Rad), and stained with colloidal Coomassie. Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands were in-gel digested by trypsin as reported by Shevchenko et al. (24Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7736) Google Scholar) and subsequently desalted and concentrated by using C18 extraction tips (25Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1730) Google Scholar). The peptide mixture was eluted from a pulled fused silica capillary with an internal diameter of 75 μm and a tip opening of 8 μm (New Objective, Woburn, MA) and filled with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ (Dr. Maisch GmbH, Ammerbuch, Germany) 3-mm reverse-phase material, directly into a quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometer (Ultima, Micromass, UK). Peptides were separated by a 60-min linear gradient of 0-100% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid) from a CAPLC HPLC system (Waters) at a flow rate of ∼200 nl/min. Combined peak lists were searched in the MSDB data base using Mascot (www.matrixscience.com) allowing ±0.15-Da tolerance for both peptide and MS/MS fragment ion mass values. In Vitro Interaction with Biotinylated Peptides—HeLa and 3T3 cell extracts prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% CHAPS were diluted to 0.25% CHAPS final concentration and incubated with various concentrations of NH2-biotinylated peptides (Eurogentec). Two peptides were used; one corresponds to the last 14 amino acids of Delta1 (see above), the second is a scrambled one (LVSEATEAKIDVEC). Proteins bound to the peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-agarose. The beads were washed with a buffer containing 0.25 m NaCl and 0.3% CHAPS. Bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Plasmids and Delta1 Constructs—Delta1 and VSV-Delta1 constructs in the pcDNA6 or MSCV-IRES-GFP (MIG) vector were described previously (17Six E. Ndiaye D. Laabi Y. Brou C. Gupta-Rossi N. Israel A. Logeat F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Delta1ΔATEV mutant was generated by PCR amplification using the following primer, 5′-cgcggatccaccatgggccgtcggagcg-3′ and 5′-ccgctcgagcttatataacacactcatccttttctg-3′ (with the Delta1 or the VSV-Delta1 matrix). The Delta1ΔATEV mutant was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA6 and into the BglII/XhoI sites of MIG. Rat Jagged1 cDNA was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA6. Murine Delta4 cDNA was the kind gift from D. Henrique and was cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA6. Rat HA-Dlg1 construct was the kind gift of L. Banks (HA-SAP97/pGW1-CMV). Antibodies—For Dll1 and Dll1CT (C terminal) antisera, the peptides encoding Delta1 amino acids 676-696 and 709-722, respectively, were coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Dll1 antiserum recognizes both Delta1 and Delta1ΔATEV, and Dll1CT antiserum recognizes both Delta1 and Delta4 but not Delta1ΔATEV. These serum were diluted 1:2000 for immunofluorescence and 1:8000 for immunoblots. The following antibodies were used in immunoblot (IB), immunoprecipitation (IP), and/or immunofluorescence (IF) with the indicated dilutions: anti-Jagged1 (IB, 1:1000;R&D Systems), anti-VSV (IB, 1:5000; P5D4), anti-HA (IP, 1:200; 12CA5), anti-Dlg1 (IB, 1:1000, and IP, 1:500; Transduction Laboratories), anti-ZO-1 (IB, 1:500, IF, 1:300; Transduction Laboratories), and anti-GFP (IB, 1:2000; Oncogene Research Products). Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblots—Whole cell extracts, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblots were carried out as described previously (26Logeat F. Bessia C. Brou C. Lebail O. Jarriault S. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—293T, HeLa, Plat-E, and 3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and blasticidin and puromycin for the Plat-E cell line. OP9 cells were cultured in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. 293T cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure and harvested 24 h later. HeLa and Plat-E cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Retroviral Transduction of 3T3 and OP9 Cells and Cell Sorting—High titers of empty (MIG) or recombinant (MIG-Delta1 or MIG-Delta1ΔATEV) viruses were obtained after transfection of the Plat-E ecotropic packaging cell line. Retroviruses containing supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and added to 5 × 105 3T3 or OP9 cells. Retrovirally transduced cells were collected 48 h later and analyzed for GFP expression by flow cytometry. GFP-positive cells were enriched by sorting using a MoFlo cytometer (BD Biosciences), giving rise to a ≥98% pure population as determined by post-sort analysis. Hematopoietic Stem Cell and OP9 Cell Co-cultures—Day 14.5 fetal livers were isolated from C57BL/6 mice. After red cell depletion using Ter119-biotin antibody and streptavidin-coated magnetic Dynabeads (Dynal), HSC were sorted for expression of c-kit and Sca-1 using c-kit-APC, Sca-1-FITC antibodies, and a MoFlo cytometer (BD Biosciences). c-kit+ Sca-1+ HSC were seeded at 103 cells/well into 24-well tissue culture plates containing a confluent monolayer of OP9 cells. These co-cultures were performed in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FCS, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol and in the presence of interleukin 7 and Flt3 ligand (27Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Immunity. 2002; 17: 749-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—Cell surface staining was performed using the appropriate combinations of phycoerythrin and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated antibodies (Pharmingen). The following antibodies were used: anti-CD4 (RM4-5), anti-CD8α (53-6.7), anti-TCRγδ chain (H57-597), anti-CD3ϵ chain (145-2C11), anti-CD19 (1D3), anti-Mac-1. Acquisitions and data analysis were performed with a FACSCalibur interfaced to CellQuest software. Analysis was gated on viable cells based on propidium iodide staining and GFP+ cells (OP9) were excluded from the analysis. Immunofluorescence—Briefly, HeLa cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% gelatin, incubated with the first antibody and then with the appropriate dye-labeled secondary antibodies as follows: Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (1:1600; Amersham Biosciences) and AlexaFluor488-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:800; Molecular Probes). Cell preparations were mounted in Mowiol, and images were acquired by using a Zeiss axioplan 2 microscope with the Zeiss ApoTome system for optical sectioning. Wound-filling Motility Assay—3T3 cells stably transfected with Delta1 and Delta1ΔATEV were cultured until they reached confluence. A cell-free area was introduced by scraping the monolayer with a plastic pipette tip. The medium was then changed. The wound area was photographed after 0 and 20 h under standard culture conditions. Time-lapse Videomicroscopy—3T3 cells were grown on coverslips and placed in a videomicroscopy chamber (Attofluor, Molecular Probes) containing 1 ml of culture medium at 37 °C and 8% CO2. One acquisition was taken every minute for 2 h. Cells were tracked using the MetaMorph software. Isolation and Identification of Dlg1—In order to identify Delta1 partners, we concentrated on the highly conserved C-terminal domain that is a canonical class I PDZ-binding motif (S/T)X(V/I) (Fig. 1). Delta1-binding proteins were isolated from HeLa crude membranes preparation by retention on a column containing a peptide encompassing the 14 last C-terminal amino acids of mouse Delta1 (see under “Experimental Procedures”). The elution profile of the Delta1 peptide column (Fig. 2A, Dll1 lane) was compared with that of a column carrying an irrelevant peptide (Fig. 2A, Cl lane). After loading on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and staining with Coomassie Blue, four major bands present only in the Dll1 lane of Fig. 2A were excised and identified by mass spectrometry (supplemental Table I). Among the proteins unambiguously identified, we focused on the only PDZ-containing protein, Dlg1, isolated from band 1 (Fig. 2A). Eight of the measured peptides masses matched the theoretical tryptic peptides masses calculated for the PDZ domain-containing protein Dlg1 (Fig. 2B). The fragmentation spectrum, which enabled the sequence identification, is shown for one of them (supplemental Fig. 1). Dlg1 is a scaffolding protein of the MAGUK family that contains three PDZ domains, as shown on Fig. 2C. To confirm the specificity of the interaction between Dlg1 and the C-terminal domain of Delta1, HeLa whole cell extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of an N-biotinylated Delta1 C-terminal peptide or a biotinylated scrambled peptide as a control. Proteins retained on streptavidin-agarose were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-Dlg1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, endogenous Dlg1 of HeLa cells (Fig. 3, lane 7) interacted specifically and in a saturable manner with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Delta1 (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, and 5). To verify the specificity of this interaction, we performed the same experiment by using another MAGUK protein, ZO1. By using an anti-ZO1 antibody, we did not detect any specific interaction (data not shown).Fig. 3In vitro interaction of Dlg1 with the Delta1 C-terminal domain. HeLa whole cell extracts were incubated with increasing concentrations of N-biotinylated peptides (Biotin-pep, 1, 3, and 7 μm): Delta1 C-terminal peptide (Dl1, lanes 1, 3, and 5) and a scrambled peptide (S, lanes 2, 4, and 6). After immobilization on streptavidinagarose, proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using an anti-Dlg1 antibody. A whole cell extract (WE) was loaded on lane 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Delta1 PDZ-binding Motif, ATEV, Is Responsible for the Interaction with Dlg1 in Cells—To confirm a physical association between Delta1 and Dlg1 in cells, we co-transfected 293T cells with VSV-Delta1 and HA-Dlg1 and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Dlg1 immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-VSV antibody revealed an interaction between the two molecules (Fig. 4A, lane 4). In order to determine whether the canonical C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of Delta1 (ATEV) was implicated in this association, we generated a mutant deleted of these four amino acids, Delta1ΔATEV. The correct membrane localization of this protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis (data not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly showed that the Delta1/Dlg1 interaction was completely abolished by deletion of the ATEV motif (Fig. 4A, lane 6). We then generated by retroviral transduction stable 3T3 cell lines expressing VSV-Delta1, VSV-Delta1ΔATEV, or the control retroviral vector MIG (Fig. 5A). Endogenous Dlg1 was expressed in equivalent amounts in the three cell lines (Fig. 5B, lanes 1-3). VSV-Delta1 immunoprecipitation with an anti-VSV antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Dlg1 antibody revealed a specific interaction between endogenous Dlg1 and Delta1 (Fig. 5B, lane 5) but not with the Delta1ΔATEV mutant (Fig. 5B, lane 6). This result further confirmed the specificity of the PDZ-mediated interaction in the context of a stable cell line. To complete this analysis, we studied the interaction of HA-tagged Dlg1 with two other Notch ligands, Delta4 and Jagged1. Extracts from cells co-transfected with Dlg1 and Delta4 were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with a Dll1CT antiserum that recognizes the C terminus of Delta1 and Delta4. Delta4 was found to interact with Dlg1 (Fig. 4B, lane 4). On the contrary, no interaction could be detected between Dlg1 and Jagged1 (Fig. 4C, lane 2). Thus Delta1 and Delta4, which have the same C-terminal ATEV motif and Jagged1 which has a distinct motif EYIV (Fig. 1), do not exhibit the same binding specificity. All together these results suggest that Delta1 PBM is specifically responsible for the association with Dlg1. Co-localization of Delta1 and Dlg1—To test if Delta1 and Dlg1 co-localize in cells, we performed immunolocalization experiments. HeLa cells transfected with Delta1 revealed a striking concentration of Delta1 at cell boundaries (Fig. 6, A, D and G). This strand-like structure was variable in length but seemed to be associated with the presence of tight contacts between two Delta1-expressing cells. Moreover, this structure did not require the presence of a Notch receptor, which was not detected in HeLa cells (28Jarriault S. Le Bail O. Hirsinger E. Pourquié O. Logeat F. Strong C.F. Brou C. Seidah N.G. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Following this observation, HeLa cells transfected with Delta1 were double-labeled with anti-Dll1CT and anti-Dlg1 antibodies. Endogenous Dlg1 was mainly detected in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells (in red, Fig. 6, B, H, and K). However, in the presence of wild type Delta1 (Fig. 6A), Dlg1 concentrated at cell-cell junctions where it co-localized with Delta1 (Fig. 6C). This co-localization was strictly limited to the region of cell-cell contacts between Delta1-expressing cells and not to other membranous regions. This observation demonstrated that Delta1 is able to trigger Dlg1 localization to sites of cell-cell contacts. Moreover, this recruitment is specific for Dlg1, because Delta1 was not able to recruit another PDZ-containing protein ZO1 (Fig. 6, D-F). ZO1 displayed the same cytoplasmic distribution, irrespective of Delta1 expression, and did not co-localize with Delta1 at cell-cell contacts. We then compared the immunolocalization of Delta1 with the Delta1ΔATEV mutant by using another antibody which recognizes both proteins (anti-Dll1). We confirmed that Dlg1 is recruited by wild type Delta1 (Fig. 6, G-I), and we demonstrated that endogenous Dlg1 remained totally cytoplasmic in cells expressing the Delta1ΔATEV mutant (Fig. 6, J-L). All together these results showed that Dlg1 is specifically recruited by Delta1 PBM and co-localizes with Delta1 at cell-cell contacts formed between two Delta1-expressing cells. Induction of T Cell Differentiation Is Not Affected by the Absence of the ATEV Motif—In co-culture experiments Shimizu et al. (29Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Takahashi T. Kumano K. Hamada Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have shown recently that deletion of the whole intracellular region of Delta1 completely abolished the activation of the Notch2 receptor. As PDZ-containing proteins are known to be involved in the organization of signaling complexes (30Harris B.Z. Lim W.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3219-3231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Delta1-triggered recruitment of Dlg1 to cell-cell contacts raises the question of its potential indirect role in the Notch signaling pathway. In order to address this question, we took advantage of the OP9-Delta1 co-culture system that enables in vitro T cell differentiation of HSC through activation of the Notch receptor (27Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Immunity. 2002; 17: 749-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 31Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). OP9 cells stably expressing either Delta1 or Delta1ΔATEV were generated by retroviral transduction together with a control cell line (MIG, transduced with the empty retroviral vector). Delta1 as well as endogenous Dlg1 expression were checked by immunoblotting (Fig. 7A). Sorted fetal liver ScaI+ c-Kit+ HSC were then co-cultured with the OP9 cell lines. 15 days later, flow cytometry analysis showed that OP9-Delta1 cells totally inhibited CD19+ B cell differentiation in contrast to the control OP9-MIG cells (Fig. 7B). Moreover, OP9-Delta1 induced differentiation of double positive CD4+ CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7C) as well as γδ T cells (Fig. 7D). HSC differentiation elicited by the OP9-Delta1ΔATEV cells showed a similar block in B cell differentiation (Fig. 7B) and a concomitant induction of T cell development (Fig. 7, C and D). These results led us to the conclusion that the deleted mutant Delta1ΔATEV is able to activate the Notch signaling pathway in an identical manner as the wild type ligand, suggesting that Delta1/Dlg1 interaction is not essential for Notch activation, at least for B and T cell development in vitro. The PDZ-binding Motif Is Required for Delta1-induced Reduction of 3T3 Cell Motility—To investigate the cell-autonomous role of the Delta1 PBM, we took advantage of the stable 3T3 cell lines expressing wild type Delta1 or the C-terminally deleted molecule (Delta1ΔATEV). Because both Delta1 and Dlg1 have been implicated in cell migration (8Lowell S. Watt F.M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 107: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32De Bellard M.E. Ching W.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2532-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we monitored the migratory behavior of 3T3 cells expressing Delta1 or Delta1ΔATEV and endogenously expressing Dlg1 (Fig. 5B). We tested the motility of these cells by using both a wound-filling assay (Fig. 8A) and time-lapse videomicroscopy tracking the movement of individual cells at 1-min intervals over a 2-h time course (Fig. 8B). As shown in Fig. 8A, ce"

Previous studies indicated that EL is expressed in endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions in human coronary arteries. However, the functional role of EL in the local vessel wall remains obscure. In this study, we evaluated the ability of EL to modulate monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface. EL mRNA and protein levels were markedly increased in tissues of the mouse model of inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide injection. Adhesion assays in vitro revealed that overexpression of EL in COS7 or Pro5 cells enhanced monocyte bindings to the EL-expression cells. Heparin or heparinase treatment inhibited EL-mediated increases of monocyte adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, ex vivo adhesion assays revealed that the number of adherent monocytes on aortic strips was significantly increased in EL transgenic mice and decreased in EL knock-out mice as compared with wild-type mice. These results suggest that EL on the endothelial cell surface can promote monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium through the interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Thus, the up-regulation of EL by inflammatory stimuli may be involved in the progression of inflammation.

The lipoprotein lipase gene family plays a crucial role in the lipid metabolism for the regulation of circulating lipoprotein levels and affects the process of atherosclerotic vascular diseases (1Dichek H.L.

We and other groups have reported a new member of the lipase gene family, endothelial lipase (EL). EL is mainly synthesized and secreted by vascular endothelial cells (5Hirata K. Dichek H.L.

Previous studies have demonstrated that EL showed preferential substrate specificity for high density lipoprotein (HDL) (7McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EL knock-out mice (LIPG–/–) showed an elevated plasma HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) level. In contrast, human EL transgenic mice (hLIPGTg) or overexpression of human EL in mice by adenovirus vectors showed decreased plasma HDL-C and apoA-I levels (6Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J.

These data suggest that EL is a determinant of HDL levels in mice.In addition to their functional role in lipoprotein metabolism at the endothelial cell surface, lipases possess non-enzymatic functions in the vascular wall. LPL within the vessel wall increases lipoprotein retention within the subendothelial cell matrix (9Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin.

LPL can also enhance monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (13Obunike J.C. Paka S. Pillarisetti S. Goldberg I.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1414-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Mamputu J.C. Desfaits A.C. Renier G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1722-1729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The local expression of LPL in the vascular wall has been implicated in the accumulation of lipoproteins and the acceleration of atherosclerosis progression through this bridging function (15Babaev V.R. Fazio S. Gleaves L.A. Carter K.J. Semenkovich C.F. Linton M.F. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1697-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Macrophage-derived LPL in the vessel wall is known to act as a proatherogenic molecule, determining susceptibility to atherosclerotic lesion formation (16Rumsey S.C. Obunike J.C. Arad Y.

Chem. 1988; 263: 15416-15422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).EL expression is regulated under various conditions. Inflammatory cytokines increased EL expression and enzymatic activity in cultured endothelial cells (18Hirata K. Ishida T. Matsushita H. Tsao P.S. Quertermous T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Jin W. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Octtaviani E. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 644-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The EL expression is also detected in macrophages and smooth muscle cells within the atheromatous plaque of human coronary arteries (20Azumi H. Hirata K. Ishida T. Kojima Y. Rikitake Y. Takeuchi S. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Hayashi Y. Itoh H. Quertermous T. Yokoyama M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interaction between the vessel wall and circulating monocytes is central for the initiation of atherosclerosis. Enhanced adhesion of monocytes to the vascular endothelium is believed to represent one of the earliest events in atherogenesis. Because of its expression in vessel wall and up-regulation by inflammatory cytokines, EL is likely to modulate the development of the atherosclerotic process. The aim of this study was to examine whether EL expression is regulated under inflammatory conditions in vivo and to clarify whether EL fulfills a “bridging function” between endothelial cells and monocyte/macrophages. In this study, we demonstrated that EL enhances human monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium and that EL expression is strongly up-regulated in the mouse systemic inflammation model. Our findings would further expand the functional role of EL in the vascular wall and provide new insights into endothelium-lipoprotein/blood cell interaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—THP-1, U-937, and COS7 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to the manufacture's recommendations. COS7 cells that stably overexpress c-Myc-tagged human EL were generated as described previously (5Hirata K. Dichek H.L. Cioffi J.A. Choi S.Y. Leeper N.J. Quintana L. Kronmal G.S. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14170-14175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To generate COS7 cells that stably overexpress human LPL with an epitope tag (c-Myc) at the carboxyl terminus, reverse transcription PCR was performed with the RETROscript first strand synthesis kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), using the primers 5′-GGGAATTCCCCACCATGGAGAGCAAAGCCCTGCTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTCTAGACTCGAGTCACAGATCTTCTTCGGAGATAAGCTTCTGTTCGCCAGACTTCTTCAGAGACTTGTC-3′ (reverse). The c-Myc-tagged LPL cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI-XhoI site of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced by the dideoxy method. The c-myc-LPL expression construct was transfected into COS7 cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. Levels of EL and LPL protein were determined by Western blotting using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibodies (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). A mouse yolk sac endothelial cell line, Pro5 (21Wei Y. Quertermous T. Wagner T.E. Stem Cells (Dayton). 1995; 13: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was transfected with human EL cDNA using the Lipofectamine reagent and then selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418. The EL expression in the transfectants was determined by Western blotting using anti-human EL monoclonal antibodies (22Ishida T. Zheng Z. Dichek H.L. Wang H. Moreno I. Yang E. Kundu R.K. Talbi S.

Mock (pcDNA3.1 vector)-transfected cells were used as a control.Mouse Model of Endotoxemia—Male C57BL/6 mice (∼20–25 g) were obtained from the Japan Charles River (Osaka, Japan). hLIPGTg and LIPG–/– mice were described previously (8Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxin shock was generated as described previously (23Zhou M.Y. Lo S.K. Bergenfeldt M. Tiruppathi C. Jaffe A. Xu N. Malik A.B. J. Clin.

Control animals were injected with normal saline (vehicle). Twelve or twenty-four hours later, mice were sacrificed with an overdose of pentobarbital, and tissues were excised for mRNA or protein extraction. In a set of experiments for lipid analysis, mice were injected with heparin (100 units/kg; Sigma). Thirty minutes later, whole plasma was obtained by cardiac puncture. Post-heparin plasma was obtained after centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Concentrations of total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, and phospholipid in the mouse plasma were determined using commercial kits (WAKO, Tokyo, Japan) (8Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal Experiments at Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine.Northern Blot Analysis, RNase Protection Assay, and Immunoblot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues and cultured cells using the Isogen reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo). Northern blot was performed using a 32P-labeled mouse EL cDNA probe as described previously (5Hirata K. Dichek H.L. Cioffi J.A. Choi S.Y. Leeper N.J. Quintana L. Kronmal G.S. Cooper A.D.

For the RNase protection assay, cDNA fragments of human and mouse EL were obtained by reverse transcription PCR using the primers 5′-AGCTCTTGCTGCCTCTCTTG-3′ and 5′-TGACAGCCTTCTACACAGGG-3′ for human EL and 5′-TGATGGTTGCTACAGTGCTC-3′ and 5′-ACTACTAAAGGGTGTCTCGG-3′ for mouse EL. The cDNA fragments were cloned into the pCR II vector (Invitrogen) and linearized with BamHI. [32P]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase, and RNase protection assays were performed as described (25Ishida T. Hirata K. Sakoda T. Kawashima S. Akita H. Yokoyama M. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protection of human EL transcripts resulted in a labeled fragment of 203 nucleotides, and protection of mouse EL transcripts resulted in a labeled fragment of 144 nucleotides. Expression of cyclophilin was used for the housekeeping gene. Protection of cyclophilin transcripts resulted in a labeled fragment of 103 nucleotides. For immunoblot analysis, mouse tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2 mmol/liter CaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 units/ml aprotinin, and 15 g/ml leupeptin).

For monocyte labeling, THP-1 or U-937 cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1 × 106/ml) containing 1 μm calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Labeled THP-1 cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in Hanks' buffered salt solution. THP-1 or U-937 cells (5 × 105/ml) were then added to monolayers of COS7 or Pro5 and incubated for 60 min with gentle rotation. Unbound cells were removed by gently washing with Hanks' buffered salt solution, and the number of binding monocytes was counted under fluorescent microscopy. In some experiments COS7 cells were incubated with monocytes in the presence of heparin (1–5 units/ml) to remove EL bound to their surfaces. To disintegrate cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), COS7 and/or monocytes were treated with 1 unit/ml heparinase I for 30 min at 37 °C prior to the adhesion assay.Ex Vivo Monocyte Adhesion Assay—Thoracic aorta was isolated from hLIPGTg, LIPG–/–, and age-matched C57BL/6 (WT) mice. The surrounding tissue was gently cleaned. The aortas were opened longitudinally and fixed with fine needles on a slide glass. The ex vivo adhesion assay was performed as described previously (27Wang G. Woo C.W. Sung F.L. Siow Y.L. O K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cell suspension of fluorescein-labeled THP-1 cells (5 × 105/segment) was added on the aortic strip and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. After non-adherent cells were gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the number of adherent cells was counted under fluorescence microscopy.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. for the indicated number of experiments. The significance of variability among the experimental group means was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's test for samples. The level of statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSEL Expression Is Up-regulated during Endotoxemia—To examine whether EL expression is regulated in vivo by inflammation, a model of LPS-induced endotoxin shock was generated in C57BL/6 mice. EL mRNA expressions in mouse tissues were analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig 1A, EL mRNA levels were markedly up-regulated in tissues from LPS-injected mice compared with those from vehicle-treated mice. At 12 h after LPS injection, EL mRNA expression was significantly increased by 2.9-fold in the lung, 3.3-fold in the heart, 2.8-fold in the kidney, 2.1-fold in the liver, 2.5-fold in the spleen, and 3.3-fold in the aorta. We next investigated whether EL protein levels in these tissues are changed by the LPS treatment. At 24 h after LPS injection, the EL protein level in the aorta from LPS-treated mice was increased by 5-fold compared with that of vehicle-treated mice (Fig 1B). The increase of EL was detected after 12 h of LPS injection and peaked at 5-fold 24 h after injection (data not shown). Also, the LPS treatment significantly increased EL expression in the lung, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen by 2.1-, 2.6-, 4.2-, 1.5-, and 1.4-fold, respectively (Fig 1B). The secretion of EL into blood was analyzed by Western blotting using post-heparin plasma. Fig 1C showed that LPS administration increased the EL protein level in post-heparin plasma. Plasma EL level increased in a time-dependent manner, and after 24 h plasma levels of EL had increased 2-fold compared with those of the control groups (Fig 1C).To examine whether the human EL promoter is regulated by LPS, hLIPGTg mice in which human EL expression is driven by the human endogenous EL promoter were injected with LPS, and then mRNA levels of human EL, mouse EL, and cyclophilin were simultaneously determined by the RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig 1D, mouse EL levels in the tissues increased more in the LPS-injected mice than in the vehicle-treated mice. Also, the assay revealed a concomitant increase in human EL mRNA levels by LPS injection, suggesting that the human EL promoter is under the control of LPS in vivo.To examine changes of lipid profiles by LPS treatment in our model, plasma levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid were measured (Table I). At 24 h after LPS treatment, the plasma total cholesterol level was increased by 31% (p < 0.05, n = 12) in WT mice. The triglyceride and phospholipid levels were also significantly increased by the LPS treatment by 321 and 25%, respectively. In contrast, the HDL-C level of WT mice was modestly but significantly decreased by 11% in response to LPS (p < 0.05, n = 12). In LIPG–/– mice the HDL-C level was not changed by the LPS treatment (n = 12). LPS administration increased plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid levels in LIPG–/– mice.Table ILipid profile of LPS-treated miceMouseTreatmentCholTGHDL-CPLmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlmg/dlWTVehicle85.5 ± 5.538.2 ± 5.554.5 ± 2.1156.3 ± 14.3WTLPS112.1 ± 4.6ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.163.6 ± 16.2ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.48.2 ± 2.0ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.210.0 ± 8.3ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.LIPG-/-Vehicle130.9 ± 6.8bp < 0.05 versus WT.58.0 ± 3.9bp < 0.05 versus WT.74.4 ± 3.7bp < 0.05 versus WT.235.7 ± 23.6bp < 0.05 versus WT.LIPG-/-LPS191.8 ± 6.4ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.480.4 ± 97.3ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.71.9 ± 2.3407.3 ± 14.2ap < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.a p < 0.05 versus vehicle-treated mice.b p < 0.05 versus WT. Open table in a new tab EL Acts as a Bridging Molecule—To explore whether EL modulates interaction between the monocyte and the vessel wall, we examined the effects of EL overexpression on monocyte adhesion. Fibroblast cell lines, including the COS7 cell, did not express endogenous EL (data not shown). Therefore, we used COS7 cells constitutively overexpressing human EL (hEL-COS7) for cell adhesion assays utilizing two types of human monocyte/macrophage cell lines, THP-1 and U-937. The vector-transfected COS7 cell (mock-COS7) was used as a control. Confluent monolayers of the hEL-COS7 or mock-COS7 cells were incubated with THP-1 or U-937 cells, and the number of adherent monocytes was counted. As shown in Fig. 2, monocytes bound to the hEL-COS7 monolayer were significantly increased compared with those in mock-COS7; the number of THP-1 cells that bound to the hEL-COS7 and mock-COS7 monolayers was 78.9 ± 5.8 and 51.0 ± 2.6 cells/field, respectively (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained with U-937 cells; the number of U-937 cells that bound to the hEL-COS7 and mock-COS7 monolayers was 47.4 ± 3.9 and 27.2 ± 3.4 cells/field, respectively (p < 0.01). These results indicate that EL overexpression can promote monocyte binding to the cell surface. It has been reported that LPL also promotes monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell surface. To compare the abilities of these lipases in regard to monocyte adhesion, we generated COS7 cells stably overexpressing human LPL (hLPL-COS7) and employed the cell adhesion assay. The expression of EL and LPL in the transfectant was determined by Western blot using an anti-c-Myc antibody. As depicted in Fig 2B, the number of monocytes bound to hLPL-COS7 was significantly higher than that bound to mock-COS7, i.e. by 1.5-fold (p < 0.01). When the protein level was standardized using the c-Myc antibody, there was no significant difference in the number of adherent THP-1 or U937 cells between hEL-COS7 and hLPL-COS7 monolayers (Fig 2B). Thus, it was suggested that these lipases have nearly equivalent abilities in regard to monocyte binding.Fig. 2EL increases monocyte binding to COS7 cells. Confluent monolayers of COS7 cells constitutively expressing hEL or hLPL were incubated with 5 × 105/ml THP-1 or U-937 cells. Unbound cells were removed by gentle washes, and the number of binding monocytes was counted under microscopy. A, representative images of the adhesion assay.

Therefore, we next examined the effect of heparin and heparinase on the monocyte adhesion to EL-transfected cells. The confluent monolayers of transfectants were incubated with THP-1 in the presence of heparin or vehicle. As shown Fig 3A, treatment with 5 units/ml heparin did not have any effect on monocyte binding to mock-COS7 cells. However, heparin treatment completely abolished the monocyte binding to hEL-COS7 cells. The inhibitory effect of heparin was dose-dependent, and significant inhibition was achieved at a concentration as low as 1 unit/ml (Fig 3B). Identical results were obtained with another monocyte/macrophage cell line, U-937 (Fig. 3A, right).Fig. 3Heparin treatment inhibits monocyte binding to EL-expressing cells. Confluent monolayers of COS7 cells constitutively expressing human EL (hEL-COS7) were treated with heparin (1–5 units/ml) or vehicle and incubated with THP-1 or U-937 cells. Control was mock-COS7, representing monocyte binding to vector-transfected COS7 cells.

Values represent mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.01 versus vehicle treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm the involvement of HSPGs, we examined whether degradation of HSPGs by heparinase treatment affects monocyte binding to the EL-expressing cells. As depicted in Fig 4A, pretreatment of hEL-COS7 cells with 1 unit/ml heparinase I completely abolished monocyte binding. In contrast, heparinase did not affect the monocyte binding to mock-COS7 cells. These results indicate that increased cell binding between monocytes and EL-expressing cells is mediated by HSPGs. To clarify whether EL-mediated monocyte binding require HSPGs on the monocyte, THP-1 cells were pretreated with 1 unit/ml heparinase I for 30 min prior to the assay. Whereas heparinase I did not show significant effects on the THP-1 binding to mock-COS7 cells, treatment of THP-1 cells with heparinase I blocked the monocyte adhesion to hEL-COS7 (Fig 4B). Pretreatment of both COS7-monolayers and THP-1 cells with heparinase I did not show an additional inhibitory effect on the cell binding (Fig 4B). Thus, EL-mediated cell binding between monocytes and EL-expressing cells requires cell surface HSPGs on both the monolayer and the monocytes.Fig. 4Heparinase treatment abolished the increased monocyte binding by EL. A, confluent monolayers of COS7 cells constitutively expressing human EL (hEL-COS7) were treated with heparinase I (1 unit/ml) prior to the adhesion assay with THP-1 or U-937 cells. Control was mock-COS7, representing monocyte binding to vector-transfected COS7 cells. Values represent mean ± S.E. *, p < 0.01 versus mock without heparinase treatment; †, p < 0.01 versus vehicle treatment.

Treatment of COS7 or monocytes with heparinase I totally suppressed the ability of EL to enhance monocyte adhesion to hEL-COS7 cells, suggesting the involvement of EL though heparan sulfate proteoglycans. *, p < 0.01 versus mock; †, p < 0.01 versus vehicle treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify the EL effect on cell adhesion in the other cell type, Pro5 cells were transfected with human EL cDNA. This cell line is considered to be an embryonic endothelial progenitor and expresses EL. The cells were grown to confluent monolayers, and the cell adhesion assays were performed using THP-1 cells. As is shown in Fig. 5, hEL overexpression resulted in a significant 52% increase in monocyte adhesion to the cell. These findings suggest that EL levels may modulate the binding activity of monocytes to the endothelial cell surface.Fig. 5EL-overexpression in yolk sac cells enhanced monocyte adhesion. Confluent monolayers of a yolk sac cell line (Pro5) constitutively expressing hEL were incubated with labeled 5 × 105/ml THP-1 cells.

The thoracic aortas were isolated from hLIPGTg, LIPG–/–, or WT mice and incubated with fluorescein-labeled THP-1 cells.

However, this proteolytic event could be actively induced by the NF-κB-inducing kinase and the human T-cell leukemia virus-encoded oncoprotein Tax or be constitutively turned on due to the loss of the C-terminal portion of p100. Whereas NF-κB-inducing kinase-mediated p100 processing requires β-transducin repeat-containing protein, constitutive processing of p100 is independent of this protein. On the other hand, Tax-induced processing of p100 appears to be both β-transducin repeat-containing protein-dependent and -independent. We show here that, besides the C-terminal sequences, multiple functional regions, including the two α-helices, dimerization domain, nuclear localization sequence, and glycine-rich region, located in the N terminus of p100, also play important roles in both constitutive and inducible processing, suggesting a common mechanism for p100 processing. We further demonstrate that with the help of the C-terminal death domain and IκB kinase α-targeting serines, the C-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain of p100 strongly interacts with its N-terminal dimerization domain and nuclear localization sequence, thereby bringing the C- and N-terminal sequences together to form a three-dimensional domain. This presumptive domain is not only responsible for suppression of constitutive processing but also required for inducible processing of p100. Taken together, these studies highlight the mechanism by which the different sequences within p100 work in concert to regulate its processing and shed light on the mechanisms of how p100 processing is tightly and delicately controlled.

NF-κB represents a family of dimeric transcription factors, which in mammals includes five members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52 (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). All five NF-κB members share a highly conserved 300-amino acid-long N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD) 1The abbreviations used are: RHD, Rel homology domain; ARD, ankyrin repeat domain; IKK, IκB kinase; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; HTLV, human T-cell leukemia virus type I; NLS, nuclear localization sequence(s); GRR, glycine-rich region; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; DD, death domain. 1The abbreviations used are: RHD, Rel homology domain; ARD, ankyrin repeat domain; IKK, IκB kinase; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; HTLV, human T-cell leukemia virus type I; NLS, nuclear localization sequence(s); GRR, glycine-rich region; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; IB, immunoblot; IP, immunoprecipitation; DD, death domain. responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation. In resting cells, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes with a family of ankyrin repeat domain (ARD)-containing inhibitors called IκB proteins, which interact with RHD of NF-κB proteins (1Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar, 2Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5552) Google Scholar, 3Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the major pathway leading to NF-κB activation is based on inducible IκB degradation. This canonical pathway could be rapidly and transiently activated by a large variety of substances, such as mitogens, cytokines, and microbial components (4Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3427) Google Scholar), and depends on a specific IκB kinase (IKK) complex composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα (IKK1) and IKKβ (IKK2), and a regulatory subunit, IKKγ (NEMO) (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). Upon activation by those stimuli, IKK phosphorylates specific serines within the IκB proteins, triggering their ubiquitination by the β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP)-containing ubiquitin ligase complex and degradation by proteasome, thus allowing the NF-κB dimers to move to the nucleus to induce gene expression (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar, 6Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3280) Google Scholar). Unlike the three Rel proteins, which are directly synthesized as mature proteins, p50 and p52 are generated by proteolytic processing from their large precursors NF-κB1 p105 and NF-κB2 p100, respectively (7Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 8Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both p105 and p100 contain ankyrin repeats at their C-terminal regions and function as IκB-like inhibitors of NF-κB (9Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 10Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Different from complete degradation of other IκB proteins, the proteasome-mediated degradation of p105 and p100 only leads to loss of their C-terminal ankyrin repeat regions, leaving intact N termini, p50 and p52, respectively (5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar, 11Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing of p105 and p100 not only serves to generate p50 and p52 but also works as an alternative pathway for NF-κB activation. Whereas the processing of p105 is constitutive (11Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), the processing of p100 is tightly regulated by both positive and negative mechanisms (12Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Induction of p100 processing is mediated by the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase IKKα (12Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S-C. Mol.

Interestingly, neither IKKβ nor IKKγ, two key components of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway, is required for this noncanonical NF-κB pathway (13Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G.

Recent genetic evidence has demonstrated that disruption of p52 production causes defects in development, organization, and function of lymphoid organs (19Caamano J.H. Rizzo C.A. Durham S.K.

Furthermore, those constitutive processing forms of p100 can oncogenically transform fibroblasts in vitro (27Ciana P. Neri A. Cappellini C. Cavallo F. Pomati M. Chang C-C. Maiolo A.T. Lombardi L.

Interestingly, overproduction of p52 is also found to be associated with T-cell transformation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), an etiological agent of an acute and fatal T-cell malignancy named adult T cell leukemia (14Xiao G.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 841-852PubMed Google Scholar). Actually, overproduction of p52 in T cells is a hallmark of HTLV-I infection and transformation, since p100 processing is very poor in T cells, including activated T cells (14Xiao G. Civijic M.E.

Once forming a complex with NIK or Tax, IKKα is activated and recruited to p100 via two amino acid residues, serine 866 and 870, of p100, to phosphorylate the specific serines located in both N and C termini of p100, thereby triggering p100 ubiquitination mediated by β-TrCP and subsequent processing by 26 S proteasome (34Xiao G.

Qing G. Rabson A. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Interestingly, constitutive processing of p100 does not require β-TrCP either (36Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) but rather is regulated by the nuclear translocation of p100 (37Liao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although much progress on the regulation of p100 processing has been made recently, it is still unknown whether there is a general mechanism for both inducible and constitutive processing of p100 and whether the β-TrCP-independent mechanism of Tax-induced p100 processing also involves p100 nuclear shuttling. Additionally, it is also unknown why, unlike the IKK targeting serines within other proteins such as IκBα, the IKKα-targeting serines in p100 are located at distant positions in the amino acid sequence (34Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 35Qu Z. Qing G. Rabson A. Xiao G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44563-44572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that, unlike the C-terminal ARD and death domain (DD), which suppress p100 processing, multiple regions located in the N terminus of p100, such as the two α-helices, dimerization domain, nuclear localization sequences (NLS), and glycine-rich region (GRR), are important for both constitutive and inducible processing of p100. We also demonstrate that the C-terminal ARD of p100 strongly interacts with its N-terminal dimerization domain and NLS, and the C-terminal DD and IKKα-targeting serines also contribute to this interaction. Through this N- and C-terminal interaction, these important regions within p100 located at distant positions in the amino acid sequence appear to come close to form a functional ternary domain required for regulation of p100 processing. Additionally, we find that NIK does not alter the cytoplasmic expression of p100, whereas Tax induces a significant nuclear localization of p100, suggesting that nuclear shuttling may be the β-TrCP-independent mechanism for Taxinduced p100 processing. These studies provide evidence for common and different mechanisms of p100 processing under physiological and pathogenic conditions.

Both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were subjected to IB using anti-p100N. Immunofluorescence Assays—COS cells were transfected with p100 in the presence or absence of NIK or Tax using Fugene 6 reagent. After 24 h, the recipient cells were directly fixed, permeabilized, and sequentially incubated with anti-p100C, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. To block protein nuclear export, the transfected cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B for 5 h prior to the immunofluorescence staining. The subcellular localization of stained proteins was detected using an inverted fluorescence microscope.

Multiple Domains within the p100 N Terminus Are Involved in p100 Processing Induced by NIK or Tax—Although it is known that p100 C-terminal mutants, including ARD and DD deletion mutants, fail to respond to NIK- or Tax-induced processing (12Xiao G.

For these studies, we created full-length p100 mutants harboring mutations at the following domains: two α-helices, dimerization domain, NLS, or GRR (Fig. 1A). The processing of these mutants to generate p52 in the absence or presence of NIK or Tax was then examined. As shown in Fig. 1B, disruption of the α-helices or dimerization domain efficiently prevented p100 processing induced by both NIK and Tax (top, lanes 4–9), whereas mutation of the NLS also partially blocked these events (compare lanes 11 and 12 with lanes 2 and 3, respectively). In agreement with previous studies indicating that GRR provides the stop signal for processing of p105 and p100 (42Heusch M. Lin L. Geleziunas R. Greene W.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6201-6208Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both NIK and Tax could induce p100 GRR deletion mutant degradation instead of processing, as indicated by a loss of the precursors but no processing products when NIK or Tax was co-expressed (lanes 13–15). As a control, a C-terminal IKKα-targeting serine mutant of p100, which shows a defect in p100 processing, was also included (lanes 16–18). To further verify the physiological significance of these domains in inducible p100 processing, we used the purified lymphotoxin proteins (LT-α1β2) to treat MEFs expressing p100 or its N-terminal mutants. Consistently, disruption of these important domains also prevented p100 processing induced by lymphotoxin β receptor ligation (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3–10 with lane 2). Thus, multiple domains within the p100 N terminus are important for inducible p100 processing under both physiological and pathogenic conditions.Fig. 2Both the C- and N-terminal domains within p100 are required for β-TrCP recruitment into p100 and subsequent ubiquitination of p100 induced by NIK or Tax.A, multiple domains within p100 are required for NIK-mediated β-TrCP recruitment into p100. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged β-TrCP and p100 wild type or its mutants together with either an empty vector (-) or NIK (+). Cell lysates were subjected to IP using anti-p100N, and the co-precipitated β-TrCP was detected by IB using anti-HA-HRP (top). The cell lysates were also directly subjected to IB to detect the expression levels of β-TrCP (middle) and of p100 and its processing product p52 (bottom) by using anti-HA-HRP and anti-p100N, respectively.

The co-precipitated β-TrCP (top) and the expression levels of β-TrCP (middle) and of p100 and its processing product p52 (bottom) were indicated.

The p100 wild type and its mutants were isolated by IP with anti-p100N followed by IB using anti-HA-HRP to detect the ubiquitin-conjugated p100. D, multiple domains within p100 are required for Tax-induced polyubiquitination of p100. 293 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin and p100 wild type or its mutants in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Tax, followed by ubiquitin conjugation assays as described in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both the C- and N-terminal Functional Domains of"
https://openalex.org/W1969993953,"The actin-related protein 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is a seven-subunit protein complex that nucleates actin filaments at the cell cortex. Despite extensive cross-linking, crystallography, genetic and biochemical studies, the contribution of each subunit to the activity of the complex remains largely unclear. In this study we characterized the function of the 40-kDa subunit, ARPC1/Arc40, of the yeast Arp2/3 complex. We showed that this subunit is indeed a stable component of the Arp2/3 complex, but its highly unusual electrophoretic mobility eluded detection in previous studies. Recombinant Arc40 bound the VCA domain of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family activators at a Kd of 0.45 μm, close to that of the full complex with VCA (0.30 μm), and this interaction was dependent on the conserved tryptophan at the COOH terminus of VCA. Using a newly constructed Δarc40 yeast strain, we showed that loss of Arc40 severely reduced the binding affinity of the Arp2/3 complex with VCA as well as the nucleation activity of the complex, suggesting that Arc40 contains an important contact site of the Arp2/3 complex with VCA. The Δarc40 cells exhibited reduced growth rate, loss of actin patches, and accumulation of cables like actin aggregates, phenotypes typical of other subunit nulls, suggesting that Arc40 functions exclusively within the Arp2/3 complex.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This complex contains seven subunits, including two actin-related proteins Arp2 and Arp3 and five novel polypeptides named ARPC1–5 (3Machesky L.M. Atkinson S.J. Ampe C. Vandekerckhov J. Pollard T.D.

Purified Arp2/3 complex is inactive but stimulates rapid actin polymerization in the presence of activator proteins, the most potent type being the VCA domain-containing Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family members (1Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3281) Google Scholar, 2Weaver A.M. Young M.E. Lee W.L. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that the Arp2/3 complex binds VCA and an existing actin filament in a cooperative manner, inducing a major conformational change, which brings Arp2 and Arp3 to an actin dimer-like arrangement and allows recruitment of an actin monomer tethered through the VC region of VCA, leading to formation of a new filament (6Pollard T.D. Beltzner C.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking, genetic, yeast two-hybrid, and reconstitution experiments and crystallography have converged on a unified model of subunit organization within the complex: ARPC2 and ARPC4 form a central scaffold, and the rest of the subunits are organized around this core structure (6Pollard T.D. Beltzner C.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Despite this wealth of data, we currently still lack direct insights into the nature of the conformation change induced by contacts with VCA and F-actin and how various subunits contribute to this change. Chemical cross-linking experiments showed that three subunits, Arp2, Arp3, and ARPC1, are in close contact with VCA (7Zalevsky J. Grigorova I. Mullins R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3468-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1270-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, these results do not necessarily imply that all three subunits contain binding sites for VCA or indicate the extent to which each subunit contributes to the interaction between the complex and VCA. Yeast two-hybrid studies identified ARPC3 as a subunit that could bind VCA; however, it has not been confirmed whether this observed interaction is direct (9Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1347-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). ARPC1 has been a particularly enigmatic subunit. Whereas this subunit is present in the Arp2/3 complex from various organisms, Arc40, the budding yeast ARPC1, was apparently absent from most preparations of the purified yeast complex (5Winter D. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Li R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Since the yeast complex preparations demonstrate a VCA-dependent actin nucleation activity comparable to that of the bovine Arp2/3 complex, the lack of ARPC1 implied that this subunit may not be required for the activity of the Arp2/3 complex. Despite the apparent lack of ARPC1/Arc40 in the purified yeast complex, it was clear that Arc40 can associate with the Arp2/3 complex in yeast (10Winter D.C. Chau E.C. Russel S.E. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and appeared to be present in at least some preparations of the yeast complex (11Goode B.L. Rodal A.A. Barnes G. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover electron cryomicroscopy reconstruction showed that the yeast complex was nearly identical to the bovine complex, and the two reconstructions clearly did not show any difference as large as a missing 40-kDa subunit (12Volkmann N. Amann K.J. Stoilova-McPhie S. Egile C. Winter D.C. Hazelwood L. Heuser J.E. Li R. Pollard T.D. Hanein D. Science. 2001; 293: 2456-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Another unexpected result on Arc40 came from genetic analysis of yeast mutants bearing deletions of each of the Arp2/3 subunits (10Winter D.C. Chau E.C. Russel S.E. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Unlike the other Arp2/3 subunit nulls, a previous effort to recover viable Arc40 null cells was unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the function of Arc40 may extend beyond that of the Arp2/3 complex. In this study, we reinvestigated the involvement of Arc40 in the function of the Arp2/3 complex through biochemical and genetic analysis. We present evidence that ARPC1/Arc40 is indeed a stable component of the Arp2/3 complex and mediates a major interaction between the complex and WASP family activators.

The anti-yeast ARPC5/Arc15 antibody (YAR15) was raised in rabbits against a GST-Arc15 recombinant protein. The anti-HA antibody (12CA5) was a gift from Dr. Frank McKeon (Harvard Medical School). Gene Disruption of ARC40 —The ARC40 gene was disrupted by replacement with the TRP1 gene. The ARC40 gene was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into pSK+ to generate pDW9. A 685-bp XcmI-XbaI fragment (corresponding to amino acids 67–295 of Arc40) was replaced with a 900-bp SmaI-NheI fragment containing the TRP1 gene. The Δarc40 strain was generated by transforming the diploid strain RLY141 with the XhoI-NotI Δarc40::TRP1 fragment. Gene disruption was verified by PCR amplification and restriction enzyme analysis (data not shown), and haploid Δarc40 cells were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection. Preparation of Yeast Extracts—Yeast extracts used for binding studies, gel filtration analysis, and pyrene-actin assays were prepared essentially as described previously (15Lechler T. Jonsdottir G.A. Klee S.K. Pellman D. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Unless specified otherwise, extracts were prepared in 1× UBA buffer (50 mm KHepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). For the pyrene-actin assay, yeast extracts were fractionated by an additional ammonium sulfate precipitation (at 55%). The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed overnight against 1× UBA buffer and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g.

To generate recombinant Arc40, a baculovirus expressing His6-HA-Arc40 was constructed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). 10 ml of insect cell lysate in 1× UBA buffer was mixed with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was washed in a column and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m imidazole in 1× UB buffer, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The Arc40 peak fractions were pooled, further cleaned through a UnoQ1 anion exchange column (BioRad), and dialyzed against 1× UBA buffer.

Strains expressing a COOH-terminal TAP-tagged Arp2 or Arp3 as the sole source of Arp2 or Arp3, respectively, were generated. The tagged complex was purified from yeast extracts on IgG beads and eluted from the beads with tobacco etch virus protease. The complex was further purified on a UnoQ1 column (Bio-Rad) and stored in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.2 m sucrose at -80 °C.

Pollard T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar. Ca2+-G-actin was converted into Mg2+-G-actin before polymerization by a brief incubation in exchange buffer (10 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2). Actin polymerization was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μm G-actin (10% pyrene-labeled) in KMET buffer (50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0) to Arp2/3 complex and VCA and monitored by continuous pyrene fluorescence measurements (λex = 347 nm, λem = 386 nm) in a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian). Determination of the concentration of the barbed ends formed in these reactions was carried out as described previously (24Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In Vitro Protein Binding Assays and Kd Determination—Affi-Gel coupled with GST-N-WASP-VCA (340 ng of protein/μl of beads), GST-N-WASP-VCAW503A (460 ng of protein/μl beads), GST (350 ng of protein/μl of beads), yeast Myo5-CA (400 ng of protein/μl of beads), or GST-Bee1-VCA (320 ng of protein/μl of beads) was equilibrated in 1×UBA buffer. For binding His6-HA-Arc40, ∼40 μl of GST-N-WASP-VCA-, GST-N-WASP-VCAW503A-, and GST protein-bound beads (1.75 μm) and 1.5, 3, and 4.5 μm purified Arc40 were mixed in a total volume of 200 μl; or 40 μl of yeast Myo5-CA- or GST-Bee1-VCA-bound beads (1.75 μm) and 1.5 μm purified Arc40 were mixed in a total volume of 200 μl. For binding Arp2/3 complex from yeast extract, 5 μl of GST-VCA beads were mixed with variable amounts of high speed extracts or purified Arp2/3 complex in a total volume of 200 μl. Kd was determined as described previously (8Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr.

Briefly GST-VCA-coated Affi-Gel beads (0–8 μm) were incubated with 250 nm purified His6-HA-Arc40 or 200 nm Arp2/3 complex in 1× UBA buffer + 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. GST-coated Affi-Gel beads were added to the reaction mixtures to equalize the total bead volumes in each binding reaction. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Supernatants were collected by low speed centrifugation. Beads were washed twice in 1× UBA buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40. Free and bound fractions were detected by Western blotting after resolving the proteins by SDS-PAGE. The bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The data were plotted and fitted with a single rectangular hyperbola equation: B = BmaxC/(Kd + C) using SigmaPlot software (Systat Software, Inc.). Other Methods—Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of fixed cells and electron microscopy were carried out as described previously (25Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography of yeast extracts or purified yeast Arp2/3 complex was carried out on a Bio-Rad SE1000/17 or Amersham Biosciences Superose 12 column, respectively, at 0.5 ml/min. Tryptic digestion and the identification of proteins were done as described previously (5Winter D. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Li R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) at the Taplin biologic mass spectrometry facility by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The Budding Yeast Arp2/3 Complex Always Contains ARPC1/Arc40 —Previously we used two different methods to purify the Arp2/3 complex from budding yeast, one involving Ni-NTA affinity and conventional columns and the other using an affinity column to which the CA domain was covalently coupled (5Winter D. Podtelejnikov A.V. Mann M. Li R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Lechler T. Jonsdottir G.A. Klee S.K. Pellman D. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). CA domain is the VCA region lacking the G-actin-binding V motif. To determine whether the lack of ARPC1/Arc40 was due to the purification procedures, we developed a purification of the complex using the TAP tag, which was faster and gentler (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, like the CA affinity-purified complex, the complexes purified using the TAP tag still lacked Arc40 as visualized by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 1, A and B). As a positive control, bovine Arp2/3 complex purified using the CA affinity column contained the 40-kDa ARPC1 (Fig. 1A). We noticed, however, that the yeast complexes purified by both methods had a smear at the top of the gel (>200 kDa) (Fig. 1, A and B, large black arrows) and occasionally an additional band around 85 kDa. To identify the proteins present in the smear, the region of the gel (boxed) was excised and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. The peptide sequences obtained for the band exclusively matched the sequence of Arc40 and cover 36% of the open reading frame (Fig. 1C, bold). Immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal anti-yeast Arc40 antibody (10Winter D.C. Chau E.C. Russel S.E. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) further confirmed the identity of the high molecular weight smear and the occasional 85-kDa bands to be Arc40 and also revealed Arc40 species at monomer size (see Fig. 2, B and C). This result suggests that the yeast Arc40 copurifies with the complex but exhibits abnormally high and heterogeneous molecular weights.Fig. 2Gel filtration analysis of purified yeast Arp2/3 complex. Approximately 100 μg of yeast complex was loaded on a Superose 12 gel filtration column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. A, the fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. B, the same fractions as shown in A were blotted with an antibody against yeast Arc40. C, VCA binding reduces formation of Arc40 aggregates. Lane 1, purified Arp2/3 complex.

M, molecular mass markers; F, fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) High Molecular Weight Species of Arc40 Are Formed during SDS-PAGE—Since most of the Arc40 associated with purified yeast Arp2/3 complex was seen as high molecular weight aggregates on SDS-PAGE, we performed gel filtration fractionation to determine whether these aggregates were present in the native complex. If the large aggregates were formed before gel electrophoresis, the Arp2/3 complex should elute faster than expected of a 220-kDa globular complex and exhibit size heterogeneity, but if Arc40 associates with the complex as a monomer, it should cofractionate with the other subunits with expected elution rate. A Superose 12 gel filtration column with calibrated separation range from 15 to 669 kDa was used. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the large aggregates cofractionated with the complex in the expected fractions (peak at fraction 26). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the large aggregates in these fractions were indeed Arc40. This result suggests that Arc40 associates with the Arp2/3 complex normally but forms large aggregates during SDS-PAGE. Attempts to prevent or solubilize these aggregates were unsuccessful. Serendipitously we analyzed by SDS-PAGE purified Arp2/3 complex that was bound to CA-coated beads. The beads were directly boiled in the sample buffer before gel loading. We found that binding to CA strongly reduced Arc40 aggregates and increased the proportion of monomeric Arc40 in the gel (Fig. 2C, arrow). Arc40 Directly Binds VCA—The above result led us to suspect that Arc40 directly interacts with VCA, and this interaction somehow prevents Arc40 aggregation in the gel. To test this hypothesis, recombinant baculovirus-expressed His6-HA-tagged Arc40 was used to test the interaction with GST-VCA from Bee1 and N-WASP and CA from yeast Myo5. Purified VCA and CA fragments were cross-linked to Affi-Gel beads and tested for interaction with purified Arc40 by bead pull-down assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both VCA fragments demonstrated similar levels of binding to recombinant Arc40, while CA from yeast Myo5 also showed strong binding, whereas the GST control did not bind (Fig. 3A). For the following analysis, we used the GST-VCA and GST-VCAW503A peptides from N-WASP because the mutant and wild-type N-WASP-VCA peptides were characterized previously for binding to the Arp2/3 complex (26Marchand J-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting the conserved tryptophan in the A region were previously shown to disrupt the interaction of VCA with the Arp2/3 complex (8Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1270-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 26Marchand J-B. Kaiser D.A. Pollard T.D. Higgs H.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, GST-N-WASP-VCA bound Arc40 in a dose-dependent manner, and GST-N-WASP-VCAW503A mutant had significantly reduced affinity to Arc40. Quantification of the amount of Arc40 bound to GST-N-WASP-VCA and GST-N-WASP-VCAW503A at 1.5 μm Arc40 showed that binding to the mutant was decreased by 21-fold compared with the wild type, suggesting that Arc40 binds directly to VCA and this interaction specifically requires the conserved tryptophan in the A region. The Kd values measured for Arc40-VCA and Arp2/3-VCA interactions were 0.45 ± 0.16 and 0.30 ± 0.12 μm, respectively (Fig. 3B). The similarity in binding affinities of these interactions suggests that Arc40 is a major contributor of Arp2/3 complex binding to VCA. This conclusion was further supported by analysis of the Arc40 null complex (see below). The Generation and Phenotypic Analysis of Δarc40 Cells—To directly test whether Arc40 is required for the activity of the Arp2/3 complex in vivo and in vitro, it would be useful to have a viable Δarc40 yeast strain. In previous work we found that Arc40 was the only Arp2/3 subunit that was essential for cell viability. With the newly annotated yeast genome data base, we realized that the original ARC40 disruption construct affected an adjacent small reading frame encoding an essential protein, Dad3 (27Cheeseman I.M. Anderson S. Jwa M. Green E.M. Kang J. Yates J.R. II I Chan C.S. Drubin D.G. Barnes G. Cell. 2002; 111: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Thus, we generated a new disruption construct that deletes amino acids 67–295 of Arc40 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The new Δarc40/ARC40 heterozygous diploid strain was sporulated and dissected on a YPD plate. The Δarc40 spores were viable but grew very slowly compared with wild-type colonies (Fig. 4A), and only 30% (from 60 tetrads) of Δarc40 spores were able to form colonies. The mutant cells exhibit highly aberrant morphology and size heterogeneity (data not shown). Rhodamine-phalloidin staining of the mutant cells showed disruption of cortical actin patches and accumulation of aberrant actin cable-like structures (Fig. 4B). These phenotypes are entirely consistent with those of other Arp2/3 subunit null mutants (10Winter D.C. Chau E.C. Russel S.E. Li R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7288-7293Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Evangelista M. Pruyne D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as well as with the disruption of BEE1 encoding the only WASP-like protein in yeast (25Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Images from thin section electron microscopy revealed that Δarc40 cells accumulated a large number (74 ± 12/section) of post-Golgi vesicles in the bud, whereas only a few (5 ± 1/section) vesicles were observed in wild-type cell sections (Fig. 4C). A similar vesicle accumulation phenotype was also observed in Δbee1 cells (25Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Arc40 functions exclusively in the Arp2/3 complex and further confirm that disruption of cortical actin patches affects a late step of exocytosis. A Partial Arp2/3 Complex Is Present in Δarc40 Cells and Has Reduced Affinity with VCA—Since we were able to recover viable Δarc40 cells, we examined the effect of this mutation on the integrity of the Arp2/3 complex. Yeast extracts prepared from the wild-type or Δarc40 strain were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography. Fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and blotted with antibodies against Arp2, Arp3, ARPC3/Arc18, and ARPC5/Arc15. In wild-type extracts, these subunits were mainly present in the complex fraction and were undetectable in the monomer fractions (Fig. 5A). In Δarc40 extracts, Arp3, Arc15, and Arc18 were still mainly present in the complex fractions, but ∼60% of Arp2 shifted into the monomer fractions, and ∼40% remained in the complex fractions (Fig. 5B). Since ARPC2/Arc35 and ARPC4/Arc19 are core subunits (6Pollard T.D. Beltzner C.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), these must be present in the complex in Δarc40 extracts for assembly of any subcomplex. Therefore, this result suggests that an Arp2/3 complex lacking only Arc40 exists in the mutant extract, although the affinity of Arp2 with the complex is reduced. Because Arc40 alone binds to VCA with an affinity close to that between VCA and the purified Arp2/3 complex, we tested whether loss of Arc40 had any effect on the latter interaction. Equal amounts of high speed extracts from wild-type and Δarc40 cells were incubated with VCA-coated Affi-Gel beads. Bound and free Arp2/3 complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies against Arp3. Fig. 6A shows that loss of Arc40 strongly reduced the affinity of VCA with the Arp2/3 complex. Furthermore little Arp2 in Δarc40 extract was bound to VCA beads, suggesting that Arp2 itself does not bind VCA (Fig. 6B). To further rule out that the reduction in VCA affinity observed in Δarc40 extract was due to partial loss of Arp2, we also tested Δarp2 extracts in the above experiment. The lack of Arp2 had only a slight effect on the interaction between Arp2/3 complex with VCA (Fig. 6A), suggesting that Arp2 does not contribute significantly to the binding affinity of Arp2/3 complex with VCA. Previous cross-linking results also implicated Arp3 in Arp2/3 interaction with VCA (7Zalevsky J. Grigorova I. Mullins R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3468-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Weaver A.M. Heuser J.E. Karginov A.V. Lee W.L. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1270-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar); however, the GST-VCA beads exhibited the same level of interaction with the Arp2/3 complex in Δarp3 extracts as that in wild-type extracts (Fig. 6C). These results strongly suggest that ARPC1/Arc40 mediates a major interaction between the Arp2/3 complex and VCA. Arc40 Is Required for VCA-stimulated Actin Nucleation— Previous"
https://openalex.org/W1981006148,"N-cadherin comprises five homologous extracellular domains, a transmembrane, and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domains of N-cadherin play important roles in homophilic cell adhesion, but the contribution of each domain to this phenomenon has not been fully evaluated. In particular, the following questions remain unanswered: what is the minimal domain combination that can generate cell adhesion, how is domain organization related to adhesive strength, and does the cytoplasmic domain serve to facilitate extracellular domain interaction? To address these issues, we made serial constructs of the extracellular domains of N-cadherin and produced various cell lines to examine adhesion properties. We show that the first domain of N-cadherin alone on the cell surface fails to generate adhesive activity and that the first two domains of N-cadherin form the “minimal essential unit” to mediate cell adhesion. Cell lines expressing longer extracellular domains or N-cadherin wild type cells formed larger cellular aggregates than those expressing shorter aggregates. However, adhesion strength, as measured by a shearing test, did not reveal any differences among these aggregative cell lines, suggesting that the first two domains of N-cadherin cells generate the same strength of adhesive activity as longer extracellular domain cells. Furthermore, truncations of the first two domains of N-cadherin are also sufficient to form cisdimerization at an adhesive junction. Our findings suggest that the extracellular domains of N-cadherin have distinct roles in cell adhesion, i.e. the first two domains are responsible for homophilic adhesion activity, and the other domains promote adhesion efficiency most likely by positioning essential domains relatively far out from the cell surface.

The first model for N-cadherin activation derived from crystal structure analysis suggested that the first extracellular domain (EC1) forms cis- and trans-dimers and so contributes to N-cadherin homophilic associations (10Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als-Nielsen J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 13Tamura K.

It has also been shown that with increasing calcium concentration, the N-terminal domain of E-cadherin first forms a “ring-like” tip to tip lateral cis-dimer with an adjacent partner. Two cis-domains then interact to form trans-dimer associations (12Tomschy A. Fauser C. Landwehr R. Engel J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3507-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 14Koch A.W.

Consistent with these observations, the crystal structure of a five domain C-cadherin (CCADEC1-5) showed that symmetric interactions between molecules were generated by tip-to-tip association, but also implicated EC2 in homophilic interactions (16Boggon T.J.

Together, the structural evidence strongly favors the conclusion that EC1 and EC2 of the classical cadherins are responsible for cis- and trans-interactions between identical cadherin molecules, and it is this interaction that yields homophilic adhesion between cells. However, studies of C-cadherin interactions by surface force measurement and bead adhesion assays have yielded a different conclusion about the roles of the cadherin EC domains in generating adhesive activity, implicating multiple cadherin domains and a “ratchet” mechanism to effect adhesion, i.e. all domains function directly in generating cell adhesion (23Sivasankar S.

In order to examine the minimum requirement for EC domains in cell adhesion, to identify possible domain configurations that may enhance adhesive strength, and to distinguish between the functional contributions to adhesion from the extracellular and intracellular domains of N-cadherin, we generated a series of cell lines in which the serially arranged extracellular domains of N-cadherin were expressed with the wild type or with the myelin protein zero (Po) transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain. We chose Po to replace the native N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, because Po is a transmembrane calcium-independent adhesion molecule with a single immunoglobulin-like extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic region with no catenin-binding sites (27Doyle J.P. Stempak J.G. Cowin P. Colman D.R. D'Urso D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 465-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). By substituting the Po cytoplasmic domain for the cadherin wild type domain, we effectively “neutralize” the contribution to cadherin cell adhesion mediated by an intracellular regulator domain. Our findings demonstrate the following: 1) that the first two domains of N-cadherin (NEC1-2) form the minimal essential unit for classical cadherin to generate cell adhesion; 2) that although the entire extracellular domain of N-cadherin is required for the most efficient cell aggregation, EC length does not influence the adhesive strength generated between cells; and 3) that the NEC1-2 domains of N-cadherin play critical roles in cis-dimerization during cell adhesion. Antibodies—A polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of N-cadherin was generated in rabbits. A rat monoclonal antibody against the EC domain of mouse N-cadherin (MNCD2) was kindly provided by Prof. M. Takeichi (see Ref. 28Matsunami H. Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 466-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies against GFP were purchased from Clontech. Rabbit polyclonal or mouse monoclonal antibodies against the Myc tag were purchased from Upstate Laboratory (Charlottesville, VA). Constructs—An N-cadherin cDNA was as described previously (4Shan W.S. Tanaka H. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Yoshida M. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The complete rat Po coding region cDNA was provided by Dr. Mika Yoshida (29Yoshida M. Colma D.R. Neurochem. Res. 2001; 26: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Chimeric constructs encoding the various EC domains of N-cadherin were fused with six copies of the Myc epitope at the C terminus. An XhoI or AgeI site was created by PCR to substitute for the natural N-cadherin or Po stop codon. The XhoI site was used for ligation of the N-cadherin chimeric DNA to the 6× Myc tag, which was isolated from the pCS+2 vector. The AgeI site was used for ligation of Po chimeric DNA with EGFP, which was subcloned from the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Finally, the chimeric cadherin DNAs were cloned into the pCXN2 vector. All PCR products and ligation sites were sequenced using the ABI computerized automated DNA sequencing. Ncad-Fc Fusion Protein Generation—A construct of an N-cadherin Fc fusion protein (Ncad-Fc) was made as described previously (30Sakurai T. Lustig M. Nativ M. Hemperly J.J. Schlessinger J. Peles E. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, a fragment from the 5′ end to EcoRV site (residues 1-2126: AB008811 accession number in GenBank) was excised from the full-length N-cadherin cDNA and inserted into pRK5 fused with a cDNA encoding the human Fc region of IgG. The fragment of N-cadherin corresponds to the EC1-4 domains of the extracellular region, including its peptide sequence and cleavable prodomain region. The construct was cotransfected with a pSV2neo plasmid into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and stable transfectants were isolated by selection with G418 (0.8 mg/ml). Because Ncad-Fc does not have a transmembrane domain, the protein was secreted into the culture medium. Ncad-Fc was collected by immunoprecipitation from the culture supernatant with protein A beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The positive clones expressing Ncad-Fc were selected by Western blot. The selected clone was plated in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum and changed to DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum after confluence was reached. The culture supernatant was collected 1 week later and kept at 4 °C. Purification of Ncad-Fc was carried out as described previously (31Sakurai T. Roonprapunt C. Grumet M. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The collected medium was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and was applied to DE52 columns (Whatman) equilibrated in 17.5 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.3). Bovine IgG contained in the culture medium does not bind to this column, but the Fc fusion protein bound well and was retained. After this procedure, Ncad-Fc protein was purified by using protein A columns. SDS-PAGE was carried out to estimate the purification. Purified protein was dialyzed against PBS with 1 mm CaCl2 and stocked at -70 °C until use. Cell Culture and cDNA Transfection—L-cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2 and in 90% DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To obtain single or double transfectants, the cells were transfected by using Superfect (Qiagen; 1 μg of each cadherin in pCXN2 vector in single or double transfection), and then cultured in selective medium containing 800 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Colonies were isolated and examined for N-cadherin-myc or Ncad-Po-GFP expression by immunocytochemistry and Western blot. Positive cells were expanded and used for further studies. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, delipidated in 100% methanol, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% normal goat serum in PBS. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with primary cadherin antibody, cells were treated (30 min) with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and washed. Coverslips were then mounted and examined by confocal laser microscopy. Aggregation Assays—Monolayer cultures were treated with 0.01% trypsin in HCMF (HEPES-buffered Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hanks' solution) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. The trypsinized cells were washed gently in HCMF containing 1 mm calcium and 1% BSA at 4 °C. This low trypsin procedure dissociates cell layers into single cells but leaves cadherins intact on the cell surface. After the cells were thoroughly dissociated, 5 × 105 cells were transferred to 24-well dishes for a final volume of 0.5 ml of HCMF containing 1% BSA with or without 1 mm Ca2+. The plates were rotated at 80 rpm at 37 °C for time course observation of aggregate formation. Cell aggregation was calculated by the index (No - Nt)/No, where Nt is the total particle number after incubation at a certain time and No is the total particle number at the initiation of incubation (13Tamura K. Shan W.S. Hendrickson W.A. Colman D.R. Shapiro L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 32Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). For mixed aggregation analysis, cells expressing different cadherin constructs were labeled with lipophilic dyes prior to mixing. We used 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine (DiI) and 3,3-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). A stock solution of DiI was made by dissolving 2.5 mg of DiI in 1 ml of 100% ethanol, and a stock of DiO was made by dissolving 2.5 mg of DiO in 1 ml of 90% ethanol and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. These solutions were sonicated and filtered before use. To label cells with these dyes, incubation was carried out for 8 h at 37 °C in serum-containing DMEM at final concentrations of 15 and 10 μg/ml for DiI and DiO, respectively. The cells were washed extensively with HCMF containing calcium. After single cell suspensions were obtained (as described above), 2.5 × 105 cell/well of each of types were transferred to a 24-well dish. After rotating at 80 rpm at 37 °C for 15-30 min, 50 μl of the aggregates was removed, placed on a slide, and covered with a coverslip and examined by confocal microscopy. Adhesion Strength Assays—To study adhesion strength in chimeric N-cadherin-transfected cell lines, plastic Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were first coated with 10 μg/ml protein A in a coating buffer (0.2 carbonate-bicarbonate (pH 9.4)), incubated at 4 °C overnight, washed with HCMF several times, and blocked with 1% BSA/HCMF for 1 h room temperature. Ncad-Fc protein (10 μg/ml in PBS) was coated on the immobilized protein A for 1 h at room temperature and then washed in HCMF four times. 5 × 104 of suspended cells in 1% BSA/HCMF were loaded on to the coated area with 1 mm Ca2+ and allowed to adhere to the substrate for 30 min. For adhesion strength assays on the cultured monolayer, the N-cadherin-GFP cell line was typsinized and plated on 18-mm coverslips (Fisher) (overnight). 5 × 105 of the suspended cells were loaded on the coverslips and incubated (37 °C for 30 min) with or without Ca2+ (1 mm). The centrifugation experiments were modified from previous study (33Lotz M.M. Burdsal C.A. Erickson H.P. McClay D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1795-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The Lab-Tek chamber slides coated with N-cad-Fc were placed vertically in 50-ml tubes. The 18-mm circular coverslips with monolayer N-cadherin-GFP growth were attached to the lids of the 50-ml tubes with Krazy Glue. All Falcon tubes contained 1 ml each of PBS before centrifugation and were centrifuged at 1,500-4,500 × g in a swinging rotor (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5804R) for 10 min. After centrifugation, the cells retained on the coverslip, and those collected at the bottom of the Falcon tube were counted under a fluorescent microscope (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—For membrane fractionation, cell lines transfected with N-cadherin truncated constructs were harvested in ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the sediment was washed in PBS. After centrifuging again, sedimented cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), placed on ice for 20 min, Dounce-homogenized (50 strokes), and placed on ice for 20 min. Cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again; these steps were repeated five times. The first pellet was taken as the nuclear fraction, and the last collected supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. This pellet was treated as the membrane fraction. For immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, 5 × 106 cells were cultured in 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C for 3 days. The confluent monolayer was then washed with PBS, scraped off the dish, pelleted for 5 min at 1000 rpm, and extracted in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, Ca2+ free, leupeptin 5 μg/ml, Pefabloc 0.4 mm, aprotinin 1 μg/ml) for 30 min. After cells were lysed, the samples were centrifuged (20 min, 15,000 rpm), and the supernatants were separated for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. For immunoblotting, protein concentrations were determined (BCA protein assay, Pierce), and samples were run on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% milk protein, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. After secondary antibody incubation and routine washing, blots were developed with the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To detect immunoprecipitates, the supernatants were incubated with specific antibody (2 μl per sample) for 1 h at 4 °C. The antigen-IgG complexes were precipitated by sequential incubation with protein A-Sepharose 4B. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively and boiled with SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. Relative intensity of each Western band was measured and compared with control (wild type N-cadherin) by NIH image program. Truncated N-cadherins Are Appropriately Expressed at the Cell Surface—We generated serial constructs of N-cadherin, which included different EC domains linked to the natural transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (NEC). The signal peptide and prodomain of N-cadherin were preserved in the EC domain constructs to ensure proper expression of the constructs on the cell surface. In order to exclude possible homophilic adhesive interactions influenced by the intracellular domain of N-cadherin, segments of myelin protein zero (Po), including its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, were employed in our experiments (NECsPoCyto). The complete set of constructs is shown in Fig. 2A. These were transfected into L-cells to generate permanent cell lines. Chimeric proteins were detected by immunocytochemistry, which demonstrated that all constructs were expressed appropriately on the cell membrane. Western blots of total proteins were performed to confirm that the expressed protein sizes were as predicted (Fig. 2, B and C) and to compare levels of protein expression in cell lines prior to aggregation experiments. In order to analyze levels of truncated N-cadherin proteins on the cell surface, membrane fractions were prepared from these cell lines, and Western blots with Myc antibody revealed eventually the same levels of truncated N-cadherin are expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 2, D and E). The relative intensities as compared with N-cadherin wild type are 98% in NEC1, 105% in EC1-2, 92% in NEC1-3, and 107% in NEC1-4. For cell binding studies, an N-cadherin-Fc fragment (Ncad-Fc) of four EC domains (EC1-4) was generated and expressed as described (30Sakurai T. Lustig M. Nativ M. Hemperly J.J. Schlessinger J.

Biol. 1999; 209: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F). The First Two Domains of N-cadherin Form the “Minimal Essential Unit” to Initiate Cell Adhesion—In cell aggregation assays, NEC1 cells as well as control untransfected L-cells were unable to form aggregates, strongly implying that the EC1 domain of N-cadherin is insufficient by itself to mediate adhesion (Fig. 3, A a-h, and B). NEC1-2 cells started forming cell aggregates at early time points, but the sizes of the aggregates remained virtually constant during adhesion assay (Fig. 3, A, i-l and B). In contrast, the cell aggregate sizes increased over time with NEC1-3, NEC1-4, or NcadWT cell lines (Fig. 3, A, m-x, and B). Aggregate sizes for the NEC1-4 and NcadWT were ∼5 times larger than the NEC1-2 cell line (Fig. 3, A and B). Our results indicate that the first two domains of N-cadherin, rather than EC1-3 as reported previously (23Sivasankar S. Brieher W. Lavrik N. Gumbiner B. Leckband D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11820-11824Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Leckband D. Sivasankar S. Curr. Opin.

The Catenin-binding Cytoplasmic Domain Is Not Required for N-cadherin to Generate Cell Adhesion—The notion has been presented that the catenin-binding cytoplasmic domain is essential for cadherin binding activity (5Kemler R. Ozawa M. BioEssays. 1989; 11: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 35Nagafuchi A.

A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). However, it has also been shown that the cadherin extracellular domains can generate adhesive properties in the absence of catenin linkages (37Jaffe S.H. Friedlander D.R. Matsuzaki F. Crossin K.L. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3589-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Vestal D.J. Ranscht B. J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Here we replaced the native N-cadherin cytoplasmic domain with that of myelin Po to isolate the function of the extracellular domain in cell adhesion. The different NECPoCyto cell lines were found to behave identically to their wild type cytoplasmic domain counterparts. The NEC1PoCyto cell line also failed to form cell aggregates during adhesion assays (Fig. 4, A, a-h, and B), whereas NEC1-2Po and NEC1-4PoCyto cell lines formed cell clusters of different sizes (Fig. 4, A, i-p, and B). Furthermore, NECPoCyto molecules, in which the N-cadherin extracellular domains were linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Po, displayed adhesion properties similar to the cadherins. These cell lines showed calcium-dependent adhesion properties (Fig. 4, A and B). Taken together, our findings reveal that the cadherin extracellular domain seems to be the sole contributor to the “purely” adhesive properties of the molecule, i.e. surface-to-surface adhesion is independent of the nature of the cytoplasmic domain. Because they link with cytoplasmic components, the catenins have important intracellular signaling roles but seem not to be necessary to allow the EC domains to generate intercellular adhesion. We considered the possibility that a single EC1 domain might be able to enter into an adhesive bond with a wild type N-cadherin across an intercellular gap. However, mixed aggregation assays showed that neither NEC1 nor NEC1PoCyto cells could form trans-interactions with cells expressing wild type N-cadherin (Fig. 5, a-c, and a′-c′). In contrast, NEC1-2 or NEC1-2PoCyto cells interacted well with wild type N-cadherin cells (Fig. 5, d-f and d′-f′), consistent with the conclusion that the first two domains of N-cadherin form the minimal unit to trigger trans-interactions with full-length N-cadherin. Strength of Cell Adhesion Seems Not to be Associated with Length of Extracellular Domain of N-cadherin—It has been suggested that C-cadherin"
https://openalex.org/W2120757204,"The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel in pancreatic islet beta cells consists of four pore-forming (Kir6.2) subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) subunits. In beta cells, the KATP channel links intracellular metabolism to the dynamic regulation of the cell membrane potential that triggers insulin secretion. Syntaxin 1A (Syn-1A) is a SNARE protein that not only plays a direct role in exocytosis, but also binds and modulates voltage-gated K+ and Ca2+ channels to fine tune exocytosis. We recently reported that wild type Syn-1A inhibits rat islet beta cell KATP channels and binds both nucleotide-binding folds (NBF-1 and NBF-2) of SUR1. However, wild type Syn-1A inhibition of rat islet beta cell KATP channels seems to be mediated primarily via NBF-1. During exocytosis, Syn-1A undergoes a conformational change from a closed form to an open form, which would fully expose its active domain, the C-terminal H3 domain. Here, we show that the constitutively open form Syn-1A mutant (L165A/E166A) has a similar affinity to NBF-1 and NBF-2 as wild type Syn-1A and was equally effective in inhibiting the KATP channels of rat pancreatic beta cells and a cell line (BA8) stably expressing SUR1/Kir6.2. Although dialysis of NBF-1 into BA8 and islet beta cells effectively blocked wild type and open form Syn-1A inhibition of the KATP current, NBF-2 was also effective in blocking the open form Syn-1A inhibition. This prompted us to examine the specific domains within Syn-1A that would mediate its action on the KATP channels. The C-terminal H3 domain of Syn-1A (Syn-1A-H3), but not the N-terminal HABC domain (Syn-1A-HABC), binds the SUR1 protein of BA8 cells, causing an inhibition of KATP currents, and this inhibition was mediated via both NBF-1 and NBF-2. It therefore appears that the H3 domain of Syn-1A is the putative domain, which binds SUR1, but its distinct actions on the NBFs may depend on the conformation of Syn-1A occurring during exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1999820766,"Here we show a novel mechanism by which FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) regulates apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and one of its receptors, DR5. c-FLIP is a critical regulator of the TNF family of cytokine receptor signaling. c-FLIP has been postulated to prevent formation of the competent death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in a ligand-dependent manner, through its interaction with FADD and/or caspase-8. In order to identify regulators of TRAIL function, we used the intracellular death domain (DD) of DR5 as a target to screen a phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library. The DD of DR5 selected from the library a peptide that showed sequence similarity to a stretch of amino acids in the C terminus of c-FLIPL. The phage-displayed peptide selectively interacted with the DD of DR5 in in vitro binding assays. Similarly, full-length c-FLIP (c-FLIPL) and the C-terminal p12 domain of c-FLIP interacted with DR5 both in in vitro pull-down assays and in mammalian cells. This interaction was independent of TRAIL. To the contrary, TRAIL treatment released c-FLIPL from DR5, permitting the recruitment of FADD to the active DR5 signaling complex. By employing FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, we demonstrate that DR5 and c-FLIPL interact in a FADD-independent manner. Moreover, we show that a cellular membrane permeable version of the peptide corresponding to the DR5 binding domain of c-FLIP induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that c-FLIP interacts with the DD of DR5, thus preventing death Lsignaling by DR5 prior to the formation of an active DISC. Because TRAIL and DR5 are ubiquitously expressed, the interaction of c-FLIPL and DR5 indicates a mechanism by which tumor selective apoptosis can be achieved through protecting normal cells from undergoing death receptor-induced apoptosis. Here we show a novel mechanism by which FLICE-like inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) regulates apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and one of its receptors, DR5. c-FLIP is a critical regulator of the TNF family of cytokine receptor signaling. c-FLIP has been postulated to prevent formation of the competent death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in a ligand-dependent manner, through its interaction with FADD and/or caspase-8.

This interaction was independent of TRAIL. To the contrary, TRAIL treatment released c-FLIPL from DR5, permitting the recruitment of FADD to the active DR5 signaling complex. By employing FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, we demonstrate that DR5 and c-FLIPL interact in a FADD-independent manner. Moreover, we show that a cellular membrane permeable version of the peptide corresponding to the DR5 binding domain of c-FLIP induces apoptosis in mammalian cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that c-FLIP interacts with the DD of DR5, thus preventing death Lsignaling by DR5 prior to the formation of an active DISC. Because TRAIL and DR5 are ubiquitously expressed, the interaction of c-FLIPL and DR5 indicates a mechanism by which tumor selective apoptosis can be achieved through protecting normal cells from undergoing death receptor-induced apoptosis.

Unlike Fas ligand (FasL) and TNF, which have a restricted tissue distribution, TRAIL mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell types. Recently, the functional expression of TRAIL has been observed on the surface of various immune cells that were previously known to induce apoptosis of target cells by an unidentified mechanism. These cells include natural killer cells (NK), dendritic cells (DC), monocytes, and T cells that have been stimulated by cellular transformation (10Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Eto H.

TRAIL function is mediated through its interaction with TRAIL receptors. TRAIL can bind to five receptors, two of which are signaling receptors that carry a functional death domain (DD), whereas the remaining three are decoy receptors. The signaling receptors are named death receptor 4 (DR4), or TRAIL-R1/APO2A (16Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Shortly after treatment with TRAIL, the DD of DR4 or DR5 associates with a similar domain found in the adaptor protein Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), resulting in the recruitment of pro-caspase-8 or -10 and subsequent formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) (25Sprick M.R.

Once formed, DISC promotes the autoproteolytic activation and release of active caspase-8, which in turn can cleave and activate downstream executioner caspases, thus leading to apoptosis (14Wang S.

The TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-8 can also culminate in the cleavage of Bid and activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (27Yamada H. Tada-Oikawa S. Uchida A. Kawanishi S. Biochem.

Because of the tumor selectivity of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and its ubiquitous expression, it has been postulated that the apoptosis pathway induced by TRAIL is tightly regulated by several mechanisms to prevent spontaneous cell death. One such mechanism involves the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis, cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), which is also known as I-FLICE, FLAME, CASPER, or CASH (31Bertin J. Armstrong R.C.

Targets. 2003; 7: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, c-FLIPS lacks the entire caspase domain (39Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

DED is a critical protein interaction domain that recruits caspases into complexes with members of the TNF receptor family (39Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, there is a unique caspase cleavage site at position 341 (LEVD) of c-FLIPL that is thought to be involved in the regulation of c-FLIP function by caspases. Indeed, another c-FLIP variant, c-FLIPp43 is the product of caspase cleavage of full-length c-FLIPL (39Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

However, it is now thought that the c-FLIP variants may have distinct roles in regulating apoptosis (39Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell.

For instance, whereas c-FLIPS has been shown to inhibit TRAIL-induced DISC formation and apoptosis (45Burns T.F. El-Deiry W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37879-37886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Bin L. Li X. Xu L.G. Shu H.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), c-FLIPL appears to have dual opposing functions wherein it inhibits Fasinduced caspase-8 recruitment and activation when it is present at a high level, but promotes activation of caspase-8 at low concentrations (39Krueger A.

Thus, c-FLIP proteins are critical regulators of death ligand-induced apoptosis, and the levels and activities of different c-FLIP variants can modulate death ligand-induced caspase activation at the DISC. Given that TRAIL and TRAIL receptors are expressed in a variety of tissues and that their functions must be tightly regulated in order to inhibit unwanted cell death, it is imperative to characterize the mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of the physiological function and tumor selectivity of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. This need is further highlighted by the implication of TRAIL in various immunological processes and its ability to induce tumor selective cell death. To identify regulators of TRAIL function, we screened a phage display combinatorial library with the death domain of DR5. Here, we report the identification of a peptide ligand that corresponds to a region within the caspase domain of c-FLIPL and specifically interacts with the death domain of DR5. We confirmed that c-FLIPL interacts with the death domain of DR5 both in in vitro pull-down assays and in co-immunoprecipitation studies of endogenous proteins in mammalian cells. This interaction occurs in the absence of TRAIL and in a FADD-independent manner. Besides, TRAIL treatment results in the release of c-FLIPL from DR5, permitting the recruitment of FADD and caspase-8 complex to the receptor. Finally, we demonstrate that a cellular membrane permeable from the c-FLIP peptide corresponding to the DR5 binding domain of c-FLIPL induces spontaneous, ligand-independent apoptosis. Taken together, these observations suggest that c-FLIPL directly interacts with DR5 receptor and regulates TRAIL-induced apoptosis prior to the formation of the DISC.

Recent work has demonstrated that residues at the intracellular end of the second transmembrane domain, between the –3′ and 2′ positions, form the ion selectivity filter of these receptors. In this study, the proline residue at the 2′ position (Pro-2′) at the intracellular end of the second transmembrane domain of the γ-aminobutyric acid type C ρ1 subunit was mutated to glutamate (ρ1P2′E) and arginine (ρ1P2′R). Dilution potential experiments indicated that the charge selectivity of the ρ1P2′E receptor channels had been inverted, with the channels now becoming predominantly cation selective, indicating the ability of negatively charged residues at this 2′ position to control charge selectivity. The mutation was also seen to have significantly decreased agonist potency and intrinsic efficacy. In contrast, the ρ1P2′R receptor channels were anion-selective but were now found to be constitutively open with high holding currents (inhibited by low γ-aminobutyric acid doses and the competitive antagonist, 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid alone) and increased agonist activity.

Members of this family are formed by a pentameric arrangement of subunits around a central ion channel pore, which is lined by residues within the second transmembrane (M2) domain of each subunit (5Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Although these receptors display a high degree of sequence and structural homology, they differ in the nature of the ions conducted. For example, nACh receptors are selectively permeable to monovalent and divalent cations, whereas GlyR, GABAAR, and GABACRs predominantly conduct anions, typically chloride. This difference critically underpins the role of different LGICs in mediating excitatory or inhibitory transmission at synapses. The proximity of residues within the M2 domain to the ion permeation pathway, and the channel gate(s), suggests that they have a considerable influence on channel gating and ion conduction, and this has been confirmed by a number of mutagenesis studies (6Imoto K.

Electron microscopic pictures of the closed nAChR reveal that hydrophobic residues around 9′–14′ form a girdle to occlude ion permeation (5Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In the desensitized state, the structure of a putative “desensitization gate” has not been definitively resolved but may involve a more extensive number of M2 residues (10Auerbach A. Akk G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 181-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 11Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the open state of the channel, the pore tapers to a constriction at the intracellular end. In the nAChR a threonine at the 2′ position forms the narrowest part of the pore, and mutations to this position markedly alter permeation properties (12Unwin N. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1813-1829Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Mutations to other residues within this constricted intracellular end have also been shown to have marked effects on ion permeation and seem to be particularly important for determining ion selectivity (6Imoto K. Busch C. Sakmann B. Mishina M. Konno T. Nakai J. Bujo H. Mori Y. Fukuda K. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 8Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Even from early work investigating the ion selectivity of N-LGIC receptors, it was suggested that a critical role was played by rings of charged residues at the extracellular and intracellular ends of the M2 domain, the charged side chains being thought to favor the permeation of ions of the opposite charge (6Imoto K.

Nature. 1988; 335: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) had also shown that the changes in charge of the intermediate ring in the intracellular end of the M2 domain had the greatest effect on ion conductance in the AChR channel. More recently, mutations to other residues, especially of a charged nature, within this constricted intracellular end of the M2 domain have also been shown to have marked effects on ion permeation and seem to be particularly important for determining ion charge selectivity (8Keramidas A. Moorhouse A.J. Schofield P.R. Barry P.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2004; 86: 161-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Bertrand and colleagues (9Galzi J-L. Devillers-Thiéry A. Hussy N.

Complementary mutations successfully inverted the ion selectivity of the GlyR, serotonin type 3 receptor A, and GABAAR (14Gunthorpe M.J. Lummis S.C.R. J. Biol.

These studies indicate that the ion selectivity filter is located at the intracellular end of the channel corresponding to the narrowest region of the channel between the –3′ and 2′ positions and that N-LGIC receptors share common physical characteristics in these regions. The current study has focused on the role of the proline residue at the 2′ position (Pro-2′) in the M2 domain of GABACRs. This proline is highly conserved across the species from which the ρ1 subunit has been cloned, suggesting its importance for normal receptor function. It is located at the extracellular edge of the constricted region and there is a high degree of sequence variation at this position between the N-LGIC receptors. We have recently shown that mutations to this residue altered the relative actions of a series of agonists and partial agonists at recombinant ρ1 GABACRs (20Carland J.E. Moore A.M. Hanrahan J.R. Mewett K.N. Johnston G.A.R. Chebib M. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 46: 770-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We interpreted these effects in terms of mutations to 2′ changing the gating equilibrium between the closed and open states of the channel and found a correlation with side-chain hydrophobicity (using mutations to alanine, glycine, serine, and phenylalanine). In the current study, we investigated the impact of charged residues at the 2′ position of the human GABAC ρ1 subunit in the M2 domain on the pharmacology and ion selectivity of the human ρ1 GABACR (see Fig. 1). Production of Mutant Human GABAC ρ1 Subunits—Mutation of the native proline at the 2′ position of the human GABAC ρ1 subunit in the M2 domain to arginine (ρ1P2′R) and glutamate (ρ1P2′E) was achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility). Plasmids containing mutant and wild-type inserts were linearized with Xba-I, and mRNA was synthesized using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Expression of Wild-type and Mutant ρ1 GABACRs in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were harvested from Xenopus laevis as described previously (21Chebib M. Mewett K.N. Johnston G.A.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Stage V-VI oocytes were injected with mRNA (10 ng/50 nl) and then stored at 18 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mm theophylline, and 50 μgml–1 gentamycin. Recordings of receptor activity were obtained after 2–8 days by a two-electrode voltage clamp (see next section). Oocytes were voltage-clamped at –60 mV and continually perfused with ND96 solution at room temperature. Known concentrations of compounds tested were dissolved in ND96 and applied until maximum responses were obtained. The oocyte was then washed for 3–10 min, which was sufficient for the complete recovery of the control response to GABA. In the case of antagonists, a complete GABA concentration response curve was obtained under control conditions and then again in the presence of a known concentration of antagonist. This enabled the determination of single point estimates from individual cells. All compounds were tested on oocytes from at least three harvests. Studies of wild-type and mutant receptors were conducted in parallel. Electrophysiology and Solutions—Recordings of receptor currents and current-voltage data were obtained with a two-electrode voltage clamp using a Digidata 1200, a Geneclamp 500 amplifier, and pClamp 8 for Windows (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA), together with a MacLab 2e recorder (AD Instruments, Sydney, NSW) and Chart version 3.6.3 program, as further described previously (21Chebib M. Mewett K.N. Johnston G.A.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 357: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Microelectrodes, filled with 3 m KCl were used for both the current and voltage intracellular electrodes, with the external bath reference electrode being a Ag/AgCl electrode, which needed correction for changes in Cl– activity when appropriate. Steady-state current measurements were obtained in response to (100 ms) voltage steps from –30 mV to potentials between –60 mV and 80 mV, in 10-mV increments. The current-voltage relationships for the GABA (100 μm)-evoked current were obtained after the subtraction of control responses to the same voltage protocol recorded in the absence of GABA. Current-voltage measurements were undertaken for each receptor in the presence of three solutions with decreasing levels of extracellular NaCl, OR2 (a control 100% NaCl, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 5 mm HEPES (with 2.5 mm NaOH)) and then in two OR2-like solutions 0.5OR2 (a 50% NaCl solution in which 82.5 mm NaCl was replaced with 41.25 mm sodium chloride and 78 mm sucrose) and 0.25OR2 (a 25% NaCl solution in which 82.5 mm NaCl was replaced with 20.6 mm NaCl and 112.5 mm sucrose). The concentration of sucrose required to maintain solution osmolarity was obtained from the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics (22Wolf A.V. Brown M.G. Prentiss P.G. Weast R.C. Astle M.J. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. Chemical Rubber Publishing Co., Florida1980: D261-D270Google Scholar). GABA, imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA), 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazole[5,4-C]pyridine-3-ol (THIP), and muscimol were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA), cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA), trans-2-(+/–)-(aminomethyl)cyclopropanoic acid ((+/–)-TAMP), cis-2-(+/–)-(aminomethyl)cyclopropanoic acid ((+/–)-CAMP), and (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) were prepared as previously reported (23Hanrahan J.R.

J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2602-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). General Analysis of Data—All current responses were normalized to the maximum GABA-activated current recorded in the same cell and expressed as a percentage of this maximum. This was then plotted as a function of agonist concentration using Kaleidagraph 3.0. This data was fitted by least squares to the equation I = IM[A]nH/(EC50nH + [A]nH), where I is the response to a known concentration of agonist, IM is the maximum current obtained, [A] is the agonist concentration, EC50 is the concentration of agonist that activates 50% of receptors and nH is the Hill coefficient. The apparent binding constant for antagonists (KB) was estimated using the Schild equation KB = ({A}/{A*} – 1) – [Ant], where {A} is the EC50 of agonist in the presence of antagonist, {A*} is the EC50 of agonist in the absence of antagonist, and [Ant] is the concentration of antagonist. This model assumes simple competitive antagonism. Dilution Potential Fitting—Current-voltage relationships were plotted using Clampfit, and reversal potentials were directly read from linear or polynomial fits to these data and averaged. Reversal potentials obtained in the three extracellular solutions (OR2, 0.5OR2, and 0.25OR2) were corrected for liquid junction potentials and changes in Ag/AgCl electrode potentials, because of changes in Cl– activity when the extracellular solutions were diluted, using the MS Windows version of JPCalc (25Barry P.H. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 51: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). SigmaPlot 5 was used to fit reversal potentials (Erev) to a modified version of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (26Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J. Physiol. 1949; 108: 37-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1806) Google Scholar, 27Goldman D.E. J. Gen.

Where aNa, aK, and aCl represent the ionic activities of Na+, K+, and Cl–, respectively, α = PCl/PNa and β = PK/PNa, and superscripts o and i refer to external and internal solution values, respectively. Because of the large changes in ionic strength of the external solutions, it was necessary to use ion activities (a) rather than ion concentrations (C) in all data fitting calculations. For the NaCl concentrations in the three different OR2 solutions (87, 45, and 25 mm) mean activity coefficients (γ, where a = γC) of 0.793, 0.837, and 0.873 at 25 °C were interpolated from Table I of Appendix 8.9 in Robinson and Stokes (28Robinson R.A.

A one-way analysis of variance, using Tukey's multiple comparison test, was performed to determine the statistical significance of the results, where 0.05 was treated as the point of significance. ρ1P2′R Receptors Have an Increased Basal Holding Current—The expression of wild-type and mutant GABAC ρ1 subunit mRNA in Xenopus oocytes produced functional GABA-activated receptors. However, when clamped at –60 mV the holding current for cells expressing ρ1P2′R receptors (–704 ± 76 nA, n = 46) was significantly (p < 0.001) greater than that in cells expressing wild-type (–40 ± 15 nA, n = 22) and ρ1P2′E receptors (–38 ± 7 nA, n = 26). This holding current was inhibited by low doses of GABA (Fig. 2c) and by TPMPA alone (Fig. 3, IC50 = 2.55 ± 0.76 μm, n = 4). This indicates that the ρ1P2′R receptors allow some ion permeation even in the absence of the agonist. In these receptors, in response to application of maximal GABA concentrations, inward currents were observed at –60 mV that were much larger than the holding currents (Fig. 2c) suggesting that the proportion of time that these receptors are spontaneously open is much smaller than channel openings induced by ligand binding. Overall, the whole-cell currents measured for wild-type and mutant receptors varied, ranging between 100 and 3000 nA for wild-type receptors, 100 and 400 nA for ρ1P2′E receptors, and 100 and 600 nA for ρ1P2′R receptors.Fig. 3a, TPMPA (300 μm, duration indicated by closed bar) inhibits the basal holding current of ρ1P2′R receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes in the absence of GABA. GABA (100 μm, duration indicated by hatched bar) produces a maximal response at ρ1P2′R receptors. b, the holding current is inhibited by TPMPA in a dose-dependent manner. Data are the mean ± S.E.

The potency of GABA (p < 0.001, n = 24) and (+/–)-CAMP (p < 0.01, n = 5) was significantly increased at the ρ1P2′R receptors, whereas in contrast, all three compounds were significantly less potent at the ρ1P2′E receptors (p < 0.001, n = 4–15). The intrinsic efficacy of these full agonists tested was maintained at the mutant receptors, with the exception of a significant increase for TACA (p < 0.001, n = 3) and a significant ∼50% decrease for (+/–)-CAMP at ρ1P2′E receptors (p < 0.001, n = 4).Table IIEffects of agonists, partial agonists and antagonists at wild-type and mutant ρ1 GABAC receptors expressed in X. laevis oocytesWild-typer1P2′Er1P2′REC50aEC50 is the concentration required to obtain 50% activation.

Open table in a new tab A similar pattern of changes were observed for the partial agonists muscimol, CACA, (+/–)-TAMP, and I4AA (Table II and Fig. 5). The potency of muscimol was increased by ∼7-fold at the ρ1P2′R receptors (p < 0.01, n = 5) and decreased by 4-fold at the ρ1P2′E receptors (p < 0.001, n = 3). Similarly, CACA was 5-fold more potent at the ρ1P2′R receptors (p < 0.01, n = 5) compared with wild-type, with a 3-fold decrease in potency being observed at ρ1P2′E receptors (p < 0.001, n = 3). The potency of (+/–)-TAMP and I4AA was also increased at the ρ1P2′R receptors, by 15- and 21-fold, respectively (p < 0.001, n = 5–9). Similarly, (+/–)-TAMP and I4AA were also more potent at ρ1P2′E receptors compared with wild-type, this increase was significant for (+/–)-TAMP (p < 0.001, n = 4). The intrinsic efficacy of the partial agonists was, in general, decreased at the ρ1P2′E receptors and increased at the ρ1P2′R receptors (Table II), with the greatest change observed being the 7-fold increase in the measured intrinsic efficacy of I4AA at the ρ1P2′R receptors (p < 0.001, n = 9). The Hill coefficients (nH) for activation of wild-type receptors ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 for the different full and partial agonists (Table II). The mean nH for activation of both mutant receptors seemed to be generally decreased compared with the wild-type, with values ranging from 1."

From a partial agonist monoclonal antibody directed against the M2 muscarinic receptor, we constructed and produced a single chain variable fragment with high affinity for its target epitope. The fragment is able to recognize its receptor on Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor to block the effect of carbachol on this receptor and to exert an inverse agonist activity on the basal activity of the receptor. The antibody fragment is also able to increase the basal rhythm of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and to inhibit in a non-competitive manner the negative chronotropic effect of carbachol. This antibody fragment is able to exert its inverse agonist activity in vivo on mouse heart activity.

The G protein-coupled receptor family is one of the main targets of currently used drugs (1Christopoulos A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2Ach-R) 1The abbreviations used are: M2Ach-R, M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; scFv, single chain variable fragment; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ECG, electrocardiogram. belongs to this receptor family. This receptor is an integral membrane protein consisting of seven membrane spanning α-helices linked together by extra- and intracellular loops that form a pharmacophore pocket. One of the pharmacological challenges posed by this family of receptors is the presence of multiple subtypes, all recognizing the same endogenous ligands. This suggests a high conservation of the pharmacophore for a particular family of receptors, thus explaining the difficulty to develop drugs (agonists or antagonists) specific for one of these subtypes. Autoantibodies directed against cardiovascular G protein-coupled receptors functionally interfering with the target have been described in several cardiovascular diseases (2Wallukat G.

Most of these autoantibodies are directed against the second extracellular loop and are exquisitely specific for one of the receptor subtypes in view of the highly variable sequence of this domain (7Mirzadegan T. Benko G. Filipek S. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2759-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Elies et al. (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G. Schulze W. Granier C.

This monoclonal antibody (IgG 2a) displays a partial agonist activity on its target receptor because of its natural bivalency. It is able to stabilize constitutive active receptor dimers and paradoxically induces a small decrease in carbachol affinity for the M2Ach-R. In this study, this antibody was used to construct an scFv fragment (single chain variable fragment), which was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. We describe the immunochemical, pharmacological, and physiological properties of this scFv fragment. As reported in a previous study with an inverse agonist scFv-directed against the β2 adrenergic receptor (9Peter J.C. Eftekhari P. Billiald P. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36740-36747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) this may open the way to the design of allosteric inverse agonist reagents that are specific for one subtype of receptor. Peptides—M2-G19K (GVRTVEDGECYIQFFSNA(K)) peptide and its truncated version V9C (VRTVEDGEC) corresponding to the second extracellular loop (residues 167-184) of the human M2Ach-R were synthesized using N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry with an automated peptide synthesizer (10Neimark J. Briand J.P. Pept. Res. 1993; 6: 219-228PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and their integrity assessed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry. Construction of the Single-chain Antibody Gene—The single-chain antibody gene fragment encoding the heavy and light variable region of the monoclonal antibody B8E5 (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G. Schulze W. Granier C. Hjalmarson A. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was prepared as described in Ref. 9Peter J.C. Eftekhari P. Billiald P. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36740-36747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar. scFv B8E5 was created by joining the B8E5 VH and VL genes together by PCR splicing with overlap extensions using oligonucleotides that encoded a 15-amino-acid linker (G4-S)3 between the C terminus of the VH and the N terminus of the VL gene. The ends of the variable gene were modified by PCR using as primers, VHRev (5′-GGT GCA GCT GCA GCA GTC TGG GGG AGA CT-3′), which encodes the N-terminal wild type sequence of the VH containing a PstI site, and VHFor (5′-ACC ACC GGA TCC GCC TCC GCC TGA GGA GAC TGT GAG CGT-3′), which encodes the C terminus of the VH and a part of the linker. VLRev (5′-GGA GGC GGA TCC GGT GGT GGC GGA TCT GGA GGT GGC GGA AGC GAT ATT GTG ATG GCC CA-3′) and VLFor, containing a XhoI site that encodes His6 residues (5′-GCA ATT CCT CGA GTT AGT GAT GGT GAT GGT GAT GTT TGA TCT CCA GCT TGG TGC C-3′), were used to amplify and modify the VL domain. The scFv gene was inserted in frame with the PelB sequence on the expression vector pSW1 (11Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) between the PstI and XhoI sites. The constructed vector pSW1-6H8 His6 was cloned in HB 2151 E. coli strain. Bacterial Expression of scFv-B8E5—The bacterial expression of the recombinant scFv protein and extraction of soluble periplasmic protein are described in Ref. 12Mousli M. Devaux C. Rochat H. Goyffon M. Billiald P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 442: 183-188Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar. The periplasmic extract was centrifuged at 10, 000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered on a 0.45-μm membrane (Millipore) and extensively dialyzed against PBS (20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Production and Purification of Fab Fragments—Monoclonal antibody B8E5 (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G. Schulze W. Granier C. Hjalmarson A. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was purified from ascitic fluids on an affinity column made by coupling G19K peptide to CNBr-activated Sepharose by a standard procedure (Amersham Biosciences); the ascitic fluids (2 ml) were diluted 1:20 in PBS, and the antibody, adsorbed on the affinity column in PBS, was eluted with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.7, and immediately dialyzed against PBS. Fab fragments were obtained by papain (Sigma) digestion (13Porter R.R. Biochem. J. 1959; 73: 119-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the affinity purified monoclonal antibody B8E5. The Fab fragments were separated from the Fc fragments on a Hi-Trap protein A column with a Gradi-Frac system (Amersham Biosciences) followed by a second affinity chromatography purification. Purity was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. No unhydrolyzed IgG could be detected. Purification of the scFv Construction—The scFv recombinant antibody fragment was purified from periplasmic extract on a protein-L immobilized Sepharose (Pierce) 1-ml column, and the adsorbed recombinant proteins were eluted with 0.2 m glycin, pH 2.7, and immediately dialyzed against PBS. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-PAGE analysis was performed as a standard procedure using 12.5% acrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Serva) or immunoblotting. For Western blot analysis, the proteins were transferred from the gels onto a PROTRAN Nitrocellulose Transfer membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) using a mini trans-blot system (Bio-Rad) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm glycin, 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The membranes were soaked for 1 h in PBS-T (20 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with 5% nonfat milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by a 1-h incubation with anti-His tag antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP 1/2000) (Sigma). The antibody was diluted in the blocking solution PBS-T milk. The proteins on the membranes were revealed by the classical procedure of the ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Immunochemical Characterization of the scFv Fragment—The instrument Biacore 3000 and all the reagents for analysis were obtained from Biacore (Uppsala, Sweden). The carboxylated dextran matrix (CM5) was activated with 50 μl at 5 μl/min of a mixture 0.2 mN-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.05 mN-hydroxysuccinimide. For kinetic analysis the G19K peptide was immobilized with the standard Biacore protocol. Kinetic studies were performed as described (14Mijares A. Lebesgue D. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inhibition assays were performed using Biacore technology; the same concentration of scFv B8E5 was preincubated with or without different concentration of V9C or G19K peptides for 30 min and then injected on the sensor chip with high density of V9C peptides immobilized by its C terminus end with standard Biacore procedure. Under this mass transfer condition, the slope of the curves is directly correlated with the active concentration of scFv (15Richalet-Secordel P.M. Rauffer-Bruyere N. Christensen L.L. Ofenloch-Haehnle B. Seidel C. Van Regenmortel M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein Concentration Determination—The total protein concentration of the purified scFv (active + non-active proteins) was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce) and by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient was determined using the Expasy program tool available on the Web. 2Personal communication, www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html. Immunocytochemistry—CHO human M2Ach-R, M1Ach-R, and M3Ach-R transfected cells (16Buckley N.J. Bonner T.I. Buckley C.M. Brann M.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. M Waelbroeck) were fixed for 5 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min. Slides were saturated with PBS supplemented with 5% nonfat dry milk. ScFv B8E5 and scFv 9C2 (17Aubrey N. Devaux C. di Luccio E. Goyffon M. Rochat H. Billiald P. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (control) were incubated for 1 h at room temperature 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, biotinylated protein-L (1/500, Pierce) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Alexa-conjugated Streptavidin (1/500, Molecular Probes, Junction City, OR) was allowed to react with the fixed primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 μg/ml, Sigma) was used for nuclear staining. Pharmacological Characterization of the scFv Fragment; cAMP Response by M2Ach-R CHO Transfected Cells Treated in Vitro with scFv—The biochemical effects of scFv B8E5 on the M2Ach-R were assessed by measuring the intracellular cAMP concentration of M2Ach-R CHO transfected cells. Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates 24 h before stimulation and then washed and incubated with 1 ml of Hank's balanced medium buffered with 10 mm HEPES containing 100 μm of isobutylmethylxanthine to block cAMP hydrolysis. After 30 min, scFv was added at different concentrations, and 30 min after the first treatment forskolin and carbachol were added to a final concentration of 1 μm and 30 nm, respectively. Stimulation of the cells was performed during the first 15 min, and then the supernatant was aspirated and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of boiling water. The cAMP content was determined using a competitive immunoenzymatic assay (Biotrak cAMP, Amersham Biosciences). The protein concentrations of the samples were determined using a BCA kit (Pierce). The concentration of cAMP was reported on the protein concentration related to the number of cells/well; the results were expressed as pmol cAMP/mg protein. Results are from duplicates of three independent experiments. Beating Frequency of Neonatal Rat Cardiomyocytes in Culture—Rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were prepared from ventricles of 1-2 day-old Sprague-Dawley rats using a modified method (18Wallukat G. Wollenberger A. Morwinski R. Pitschner H.F. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured as monolayers for 8 days at 37 °C in SM 20-1 medium (32Halle W. Wollenberger A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1970; 25: 292-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 2 μm fluorodeoxyuridine and exhibited a spontaneous basal pulsation rate of 160 ± 20 beats/min. The cardiomyocyte cultures were washed with fresh medium containing serum and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with the same medium under stationary conditions. The flasks were transferred to the heatable stage of an inverted microscope, reagent was added, and the increase of the beating rate was determined for at least 10 observations for each experimental point in three independent experiments. Physiological Characterization of the scFv Fragment in Vivo on Mice—Twelve male BALB/c mice (20 g each) were given tail intravenous injections while being kept in individual mouse ECG boxes as described in Ref. 19Eftekhari P. Roegel J.C. Lezoualc'h F. Fischmeister R. Imbs J.L. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar for four continuous weeks. The ECG boxes (Rodent Restrainers for ECG, Sesams, Logelbach, France) have four conductive surfaces on their bottom to position the four limbs of the conscious animal. These surfaces are coated with contact gel and connected to analogue amplifiers for signal amplification and filtering (0.5-30 Hz cutoff frequencies; Bessel type filter, order 2; 50 Hz notch filter (-30 db); Sesams, Logelbach, France). The amplified and filtered signals are digitized at 256 Hz on a signal processor board (64 channels, 16-bit resolution) and stored in digital form on a personal computer using the HEM recording software (Notocord, Croissy sur Seine, France). Three-lead electrocardiograms (DI, DII, DIII derivations) were recorded from 12 conscious mice during 60 min. Mice were not anesthetized to prevent ECG modifications (20Chaves A.A. Dech S.J. Nakayama T. Hamlin R.L. Bauer J.A. Carnes C.A. Life Sci. 2003; 72: 2401-2412Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After 20 min in the ECG box, each treatment in a 100-μl volume was injected intravenously (Table I). The plan of the intravenous injection was designed to have a period of 1 day between two injections of carbachol.Table IPlan of intravenous treatment of 12 mice for the study of the scFv activity on their heart function via the M2Ach-R Open table in a new tab The ECG signal was analyzed off line. The QRS complexes were identified, and artifact, ectopic beats, and normal beats were recognized and annotated (ECG-Auto, EMKA Technologies, Paris, France). The heart rate (60/mean interval between the R wave peaks of adjacent normal QRS complexes) (bpm) was calculated based on the beat per beat data. Statistics—Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab software. To compare the percent of variation of the cardiac rhythm with the rhythm at t = 0, we used a Student's paired match t test to compare the integral of each curve upon the different treatments. Molecular Modeling—ScFv B8E5 model was built in silico using the Biopolymer, Homology, and Discover software of Accelrys (San Diego, CA). The VH and VL chains of the scFv B8E5 were built from the Protein Data Bank accession codes 1IFH and 2MCP, respectively. The sequences of the templates (see Fig. 6) were changed to those of the scFv B8E5, and the modified chain was submitted to a steepest descent energy minimization of 2000 steps until a root mean square derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol Å was reached. The assembly was again submitted to a conjugate gradient minimization procedure of 2000 steps with the backbone fixed. Cloning, Sequencing, Expression, and Immunochemical Characterization of the scFv B8E5 Fragment—The N-terminal part of the VH and VL of the B8E5 antibody was sequenced by Edman degradation to design the primers used for the amplification of the two domains. The original sequence of the VH, EVQLVE and the VL, DIVMAQ, helped us to design the VHrev and VLRev primer. The scFv-encoding gene derived from the variable regions (VH and VL linked together via a short linker (G4S)3) of the IgG2a B8E5 monoclonal antibody (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G.

The sequence of the single-chain construction is represented in Fig. 1. We confirmed that the cloned VL gene did not correspond to the aberrant κ transcript of the sp2/0 hybridomas (21Carroll W.L.

It also allows the determination of the active concentration of analytes in solution (15Richalet-Secordel P.M. Rauffer-Bruyere N. Christensen L.L. Ofenloch-Haehnle B. Seidel C. Van Regenmortel M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 249: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The active concentration showed that 100% of the purified recombinant protein was able to interact with the antigenic peptides V9C. The calculated concentration allowed us to determine the kinetic parameters of the scFv B8E5 using a Biacore System and the BIAeval 3.1 software. A Langmuir binding model gave us the following kinetic parameters: the kon = 2.4×105m-1 s-1, the koff = 2.15×10-3 s-1, and the equilibrium constant KA = 1.1×108m-1. These parameters are similar to those calculated under the same conditions for the B8E5 proteolytic Fab fragment (kon = 7.4×105m-1 s-1, koff = 4.7×10-3 s-1). The inhibition constants of this scFv fragment were determined as described in under “Experimental Procedures:” Ki values were determined as 5.7×10-8 M and 4.7×10-5 M for the short V9C peptide and for the extended G19K peptide, respectively. To assess the ability of the scFv to interact with the receptor, immunocytochemical experiments were performed on CHO M2Ach-R transfected cells. Fig. 2b shows the presence of a specific membrane and cytoplasmic labeling when using the scFv B8E5 fragment. No specific labeling could be observed on CHO untransfected cells, CHO transfected with M1Ach-R and M3Ach-R, and on CHO transfected with the M2Ach-R treated with an scFv control. Pharmacological Characterization of the scFv Fragment—Next we determined if the scFv construction had pharmacological properties on the M2Ach-R. Activation of the M2Ach-R induces a decrease of intracellular cAMP mediated by the Gi protein (23Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). CHO M2Ach-R transfected cells were pretreated with 1 μm of forskolin, which activates adenylyl cyclase. The decrease of intracellular measured cAMP thus will be directly correlated with activation of the M2Ach-R. CHO M2Ach-R transfected cells stimulated with forskolin were treated with different scFv concentrations in the presence or absence of carbachol (30 nm). Interestingly, the B8E5 scFv fragments were able to significantly increase the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). This is the main characteristic of inverse agonists (see Ref. 24Daeffler L. Landry Y. Fundam. Clin. Pharmacol. 2000; 14: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar for review). Moreover, Fig. 3b shows that scFv B8E5 was able to inhibit the activation of the M2 muscarinic receptor by carbachol in a dose-dependent manner. Also, a fixed concentration of 25 nm scFv seems to inhibit in a non-competitive manner the effect of carbachol (Fig. 3c). These results were confirmed in vitro by measuring the beating rate of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes stimulated by carbachol (Fig. 4). The basal beating rate of the cardiomyocytes as well as the carbachol dose-response curve were increased. In view of the fact that the carbachol dose-response curve in presence of scFv only showed a decrease in the maximal response not present with the 9C2 scFv control (data not shown), it typically represents a non-competitive inhibition of the carbachol effect. We thus conclude through two different experiments that the scFv acts in a non-competitive manner.Fig. 4Pharmacological effects of scFv B8E5 on neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. scFv B8E5 increased spontaneous beating (a) rate and inhibited the carbachol stimulation of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in a non-competitive manner (b); the decrease in beat number/min is represented by increasing concentration of carbachol in the presence of scFv B8E5 (6 nm (□) and 12 nm (Δ)) or without co-treatment (♦).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Physiological Characterization of the scFv Fragment—To investigate the possible in vivo effects of the scFv B8E5 on the heart, we injected the scFv construction in mice alone or combined with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (0.1 mg/kg) or the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol (2 mg/kg). The animals had a comparable heart rate before the different administrations (data not shown). ScFv injected alone induced a significant increase (p = 0.012) of the heart rate compared with the NaCl treatment at the beginning of the recording (Fig. 5a). Injection of carbachol (0.1 mg/kg intravenously injected) induced a marked decrease of the heart rate. This effect was significantly blunted (p = 0.041) in the presence of scFv B8E5 (Fig. 5b). Isoproterenol (2 mg/kg), a β-agonist, induced a marked increase of the heart rate. This increase was significantly reduced (p = 0.042) in the presence of scFv B8E5 (Fig. 5c). Most of the neurotransmitter receptors belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors representing one of the main targets of cardiovascular and neurological drugs. The pharmacological existence of subfamilies of these receptors was first assessed by showing that the same neurotransmitters had different effects on different tissues. Cloning, sequencing, and expressing molecules, coded by different genes but recognizing the same neurotransmitters, highlighted this molecular diversity. In view of the putative structure of these proteins, the localization of the neurotransmitters in an intramembrane pocket was suggested. This fact only allows a limited amount of variability to dock different agonist and antagonists. On the other hand, the constancy of the pharmacophore pocket between members of the same family could explain the difficulty to design and synthesize molecules with an exclusive specificity for one of the receptor subtypes. In contrast, the extracellular domains of receptors of the same family can vary more widely which suggests the possibility to raise antibodies possessing the single specificity intended by the pharmacologists. Drug discovery based on immunological reagents was already forwarded more than 20 years ago, but only recently because of the expansion of biotechnological tools could it be considered as a realistic goal. Indeed, recent results have shown that such approach could lead to functional peptides derived from antibodies directed against cell receptors (25Bes C. Briant-Longuet L. Cerruti M. De Berardinis P. Devauchelle G. Devaux C. Granier C. Chardes T. DeBerardinis P. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The finding that autoantibodies against G protein-coupled receptors were present in and responsible for different cardiovascular diseases prompted us to use a similar approach for the development of antibody fragments of low molecular weight interfering with this family of receptors. Cloning and sequencing of the variable regions of the B8E5 monoclonal antibody in comparison with the corresponding germ line showed 45% and 42.6% variability, respectively, for the heavy chain and for the light chain. The sequence of the variable part of the heavy chain corresponded for 84% to that of the Protein Data Bank accession code 1IFH (26Schulze-Gahmen U. Rini J.M. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1098-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) (IgG 2A Fab fragment complexed with a 7-mer peptide from influenza virus hemagglutinin HA1-(101-107)), whereas the sequence of the light chain corresponded for 94.7% to that of the Protein Data Bank accession code 2MCP (27Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) (phosphocholine binding immunoglobulin Fab fragment McPC603). The high similarity of the scFv fragment with antibody combining sites of a known three-dimensional structure allowed us to construct a realistic model of the scFv fragment in silico (Fig. 6). The percents of φ and ψ angles core region occupancy are for the VH and for the VL of 74.6% and 73.9%, respectively. The physicochemical parameters of the epitope-scFv interaction as measured by surface plasmon resonance allowed us to confirm that the scFv fragment had similar binding properties as the Fab fragment of the B8E5 antibody. Difference in inhibition constants for the long (G19K) and the short (V9C) peptides is certainly caused by a lesser accessibility of the epitope for the antibody fragment on the long peptide. The same observation was made previously with the monoclonal antibody (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G. Schulze W. Granier C. Hjalmarson A. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Active concentration calculation of purified scFv shows that 100% of the purified recombinant proteins are able to interact with their antigen. Protein L used for the purification of the scFv interacted with the VL κ chain (28Akerstrom B. Bjorck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19740-19746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Graille M. Stura E.A. Housden N.G. Beckingham J.A. Bottomley S.P. Beale D. Taussig M.J. Sutton B.J. Gore M.G.

The 100% of activity of purified scFv thus can be explained by the fact that only correctly folded recombinant proteins can also interact with protein L. A cytochemistry experiment showed a specific labeling of membrane and of the cytoplasm of M2Ach-R transfected cells compared with untransfected cells and cells transfected with two other subtypes of muscarinic receptors. These results are in accordance with the data presented in Table II, which show that the recognized epitope VRTVE is different in the other muscarinic receptors subtype. Indeed, the V residue at the Nter portion of the epitope, important for the interaction peptide/antibody (8Elies R. Fu L.X. Eftekhari P. Wallukat G. Schulze W. Granier C. Hjalmarson A. Hoebeke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is not present in the other subtypes of muscarinic receptors. These results confirm the high specificity of this antibody fragment on the M2Ach-R.Table IIAlignments of the second extracellular loop of the five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptorsM2ACh-R163QFIVGVRTVEDGECYIQFFSNAM1ACh-R165QYLVGERTVLAGQCYIQFLSQPM3ACh-R208QYFVGKRTVPPGECFIQFLSEPM4ACh-R172QFVVGKRTVPDNQCFIQFLSNPM5ACh-R170QYLVGKRTVPLDECQIQFLSEP Open table in a new tab In our previous studies, an scFv fragment of an antibody directed against the second extracellular loop of the β2 adrenergic receptor was shown to have an inverse agonist activity (9Peter J.C. Eftekhari P. Billiald P. Wallukat G. Hoebeke J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36740-36747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We supposed that monovalency of the anti-M2Ach-R antibody fragment compared with the bivalency of the partial agonist monoclonal antibody B8E5 led to the same properties. To directly check the pharmacological activity of this recombinant protein, we studied the accumulation of cAMP in M2R-Ach CHO transfected cells in the presence of forskolin with and without carbachol. The scFv fragments not only inhibited the cAMP decrease induced by carbachol, but they also increased the cAMP accumulation induced by forskolin. This means that the scFv fragments behave as inverse agonists, i.e. molecules specifically recognizing the resting conformation of the receptor and shifting the active → resting conformational equilibrium to the right. A dose-response carbachol curve in the presence of scFv suggested that carbachol inhibition was non-competitive, suggesting an allosteric modulation of the receptor. The scFv fragment was able to increase the spontaneous beating rate of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in culture. We previously checked the 100% identity between the sequence of the second extracellular loop of the M2Ach-R from human and rat. The scFv fragment also blocked the effect on the same cells of the muscarinic agonist carbachol. This effect did not shift the carbachol dose-response curve to higher agonist concentrations but decreased the maximally obtained response. These results confirm that the scFv fragment blocks the accessibility of the pharmacophore pocket in a non-competitive manner or allosterically prevent the conformation transition from inactive to active state of the receptor. This antibody fragment is able to decrease parasympathetic activity via its action on the M2Ach muscarinic receptor (no difference of sequence can be observed between the second extracellular loop of rat and human) and thus to induce an increase of the heart rate from t = 1 to t = 10. The antibody fragment is also able to block the action of carbachol in vivo. These results were similar to that observed in vitro, physiologically confirming the biochemical inverse agonist activity of the fragment. Moreover, isoproterenol treatment combined with scFv showed a smaller increase of the heart rate than for isoproterenol alone. This phenomenon was observed with low doses of pirenzepine, an inverse agonist of the M2 muscarinic receptor (30Daeffler L. Schmidlin F. Gies J.P. Landry Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), combined with isoprenaline in healthy human volunteers (31Brodde O.E. Konschak U. Becker K. Ruter F. Poller U. Jakubetz J. Radke J. Zerkowski H.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To summarize, we have completely characterized a polypeptide with a specific inverse agonist activity on the M2 muscarinic receptor. It is the second example of a G protein-coupled receptor inverse agonist shifting by an allosteric mechanism the receptor to its resting conformation. The structural model that we obtained from the scFv fragment could help us to design shorter peptide fragments with similar properties. We thank Dr. M. Waelbroeck (Faculté de Médecine, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium) for providing the CHO M1Ach-R, M2Ach-R, and M3Ach-R transfected cells."

It has been shown in animal models that blocking bone destruction can result in decreased myeloma tumor burden. Osteoclasts are bone destroying cells found in the bone marrow, and their significance in myeloma is supported by recent findings that osteoclasts alone can support sustained survival and proliferation of purified primary myeloma cells in ex vivo co-cultures. However, molecular mechanisms associated with interactions between myeloma cells and osteoclasts remain unclear. Here, we show that when myeloma plasma cells are co-cultured with osteoclasts, chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1) is the most significantly altered soluble, secreted protein present in the conditioned medium. RNA interference experiments with CHSY1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the amount of CHSY1 in the co-culture conditioned medium, and this was associated with a 6.25-fold increase in apoptotic myeloma cells over control co-cultures. CHSY1 contains a Fringe domain, and Fringe is well known for its regulation of Notch signaling via its DDD motif. And interestingly, Fringe domain in CHSY1 has this DDD motif. Shortly after co-culture with osteoclasts, we found that the Notch2 receptor was activated in myeloma cells but Notch1 was not. Activation of Notch2 was down-regulated by CHSY1 siRNA treatment. Modulating Notch signaling by CHSY1 via its DDD motif provides new insight into mechanisms of the interactions between myeloma cells and their bone marrow microenvironment. Targeting this interaction could shed light on treatment of myeloma, which is currently incurable.

Despite treatment advances, myeloma is uniformly fatal to the nearly 14,000 people newly diagnosed with the disease in the United States each year. Myeloma is closely associated with lytic bone disease, the most debilitating manifestation of the malignancy, found in 80% of patients (1Hussein M.A. Juturi J.V. Lieberman I. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The current data on MM disease progression indicate that myeloma cell proliferation is highly dependent upon the state of the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, it has been reported that interactions between myeloma cells and their microenvironment alter the ability of myeloma cells to resist to chemotherapy (2Hardin J. MacLeod S. Grigorieva I. Chang R. Barlogie B. Xiao H. Epstein J. Blood. 1994; 84: 3063-3070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grigorieva I. Thomas X. Epstein J. Exp. Hematol. 1998; 26: 597-603PubMed Google Scholar). It appears that continued proliferation of myeloma cells is somehow dependent upon the bone-destructive properties of osteoclasts. This is supported by the clinical observation that patients with smoldering myeloma who were treated only with the bone-resorption inhibitor pamidronate experienced tumor burden reduction (8Dhodapkar M.V.

It has been reported that inhibiting myeloma bone disease by halting bone resorption via treatment with bisphosphonates or inhibitors of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) signaling has a profound antimyeloma effect. The data using the severe combined immunodeficient-human (SCID-hu) animal model indicate that osteoclasts, cells responsible for the break-down of bone, facilitate survival and growth of myeloma cells (4Yaccoby S.

Furthermore, it has been recently found that sustained survival and proliferation of purified primary myeloma cells in ex vivo cultures can be supported by osteoclasts alone in a contact-dependent manner (10Yaccoby S. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M. Miao H.Q. Kussie P. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Sanderson R.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2016-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). While the symbiolic relationaship between myeloma cells and osteoclasts are well demonstrated, their molecular details have not been fully determined. We focused our efforts on examining these molecular mechanisms in an effort to ultimately identify novel therapeutic targets for myeloma. As a first step toward this goal, we cultured myeloma cells with osteoclasts and examined the changes in secreted protein profiles. After co-culturing the cells, we used cytokine arrays to detect changes in specific known proteins and surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) proteomics to examine global changes and also identify proteins undetectable in the cytokine arrays. We identified the most prominent secreted protein as chondroitin synthase 1 (CHSY1), which has a predicted Fringe domain putatively regulating the Notch pathway (11Baron M. Aslam H. Flasza M. Fostier M. Higgs J.E. Mazaleyrat S.L. Wilkin M.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Fringe activates Notch2 signaling from Delta ligands and simultaneously inhibits Notch1 signaling from Serrate and Jagged ligands (13Fleming R.J. Gu Y. Hukriede N.A. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2973-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Recently, Notch signaling has been discovered to be involved in intercellular signaling between myeloma cells and other cells in the bone marrow. We hypothesize that CHSY1 plays a role in myeloma by stimulating Notch2 signaling and inhibiting Notch1 signaling. Here, we present our results showing that CHSY1, the most prominent secreted protein detected in myeloma cell-osteoclast co-culture conditioned medium, activates Notch2 signaling in myeloma cells. This is particularly significant because of the apparent relationship between Notch signaling and the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance by myeloma cells. Our findings may provide new insight into the biology of myeloma as well as chemotherapy resistance in other cancers. Preparation of Myeloma Cells—Samples of myeloma plasma cells (MM PCs) were obtained from heparinized bone marrow aspirates from 50 patients with active myeloma during scheduled clinic visits. Signed Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent forms are kept on record. Bone marrow samples were separated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (specific gravity: 1.077 g/ml), and the proportion of MM PCs in the light density cell fractions was determined by CD38/CD45 flow cytometry. MM PCs were isolated using CD138 immunomagnetic bead selection and the autoMACs automated separation system (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Purity of MM PC preparations was determined by CD38/CD45 flow cytometry to be routinely 95% (10Yaccoby S. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M. Miao H.Q. Kussie P. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Sanderson R.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2016-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Preparation of Osteoclasts—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from patients with myeloma by leukopheresis. Signed Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent forms are kept on record. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in osteoclast medium (α-minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics (10 μg/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20 μg/ml neomycin), RANKL (50 ng/ml], human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 25 ng/ml), and dexamethasone (10 nm)). After removal of non-adherent cells, 95% of the remaining cells are multinucleated osteoclast (OC) and their precursors. Osteoclasts generated in these culture are multinucleated, TRAP- and vitronectin receptor-positive, and form resorption pits on mineralized discs; details have been described previously (10Yaccoby S. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M. Miao H.Q. Kussie P. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Sanderson R.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2016-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Myeloma Cell-Osteoclast Co-culture—Osteoclast cultures in 6-well and 24-well plates were washed three times with serum-free α-MEM medium without RANKL or M-CSF. Purified MM PCs in serum-free α-MEM were added to osteoclast cultures in a ratio of ∼1:1000. After 6 h of co-culture, media and MM PCs were collected and centrifuged, the media frozen at –80 °C for future analysis, and the cells analyzed for viability by trypan blue exclusion and for apoptotic ratio by propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry. Apoptosis Assay—The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined using PI flow cytometry. MM PCs were recovered by shaking and washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 rpm, washed in PBS and centrifuged again, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, fixed in 800 μl of 70% ethanol, and stored overnight at 4 °C. MM PCs were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of staining solution (RNase A (40 μg/ml) and PI (50 μg/ml) in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Cells were then analyzed on an Immunocytometry system FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using a data collection rate of 50–80 events/s. Apoptotic sub-G1 and cell cycle G2/M analyses were performed by Cell Quest (BD Biosciences). Human Cytokine Array Analysis—Aliquots of serum-free media from MM PC cultures (from four different donors), osteoclast cultures, and MM PC-osteoclast co-cultures were collected after 6 h. Media samples were mailed on dry ice to RayBiotech, Inc. (Norcross, GA) for processing on their 79-cytokine array. Briefly, the array membrane was incubated with an experimental sample, a mixture of biotin-labeled antibodies, and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for detection. Each array has internal positive (biotin-labeled protein) and negative controls (bovine serum albumin). SELDI ProteinChip Analyses—Soluble proteins in serum-free 6-h conditioned medium were studied using SELDI ProteinChip technology (Ciphergen, Fremont, CA). One-μl aliquots were spotted on NP20 ProteinChip arrays and air-dried. An energy-absorbing matrix (sinapinic acid, Ciphergen) was added, and protein profiles were analyzed on ProteinChip reader (model PBSII) calibrated with protein standards for mass determination (Ciphergen). Protein mass spectra were generated using 60 laser shots (laser intensity of 230, detector sensitivity of 9 arbitrary units). Enrichment and Identification of Protein of Interest—The high molecular weight proteins in 6-h conditioned medium were enriched ∼100-fold using Centricon YM-30 centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Concentrated proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% Ready Gels (BioRad). After staining with colloidal blue staining kit (Invitrogen), a protein band corresponding to the size of the protein of interest, as determined by SELDI, was excised and trypsin-digested using ProteinChip peptide mapping kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Ciphergen). Mass spectra of digested peptides were generated by SELDI and submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein data base for identification. CHSY1 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Three siRNAs (siRNA1, siRNA2, and siRNA3) were custom-designed and synthesized (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) for use against CHSY1. Use of three sequences gives a 98% chance of successfully inhibiting CHSY1 (Ambion, Inc). We transfected siRNA into cells using silencer siRNA transfection kit according to the company's protocol (Ambion, Inc.). Cultures were treated for 2 days with siRNA (siRNA1, -2, or -3). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) siRNA was used as a negative control according to the same protocol as for siRNA1, -2, and -3. Western Blot Analysis for Notch Activation—For cytosolic protein extraction of myeloma and osteoclast, about 20 millions of myeloma cells and osteoclasts were lysed in 1 ml of a 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture P 8340 (a mixture of 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestain, leupeptin, and aprotinin) (Sigma), after washing three times in PBS buffer, at a dilution of 1:200. The cytosolic fractions were collected by spinning the sample at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Fifty μg of protein from myeloma or osteoclast cytosolic fraction were resolved with 12–20% SDS-PAGE. Fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (polyvinylidene difluoride, Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked overnight with 5% dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated 2 h at room temperature with anti-Notch1, anti-Notch2, and anti-Delta antibodies (sc-6014, sc-5545, and sc-8155, respectively, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were incubated 1 h with 1:5000 dilution of either horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (0.8 mg/ml; Pierce). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal substrate Western blotting kit (Pierce). The blot was stripped and reprobed for actin (sc-7200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as an internal control (17LaVoie M.J. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

All experiments were repeated at least three times. Student's paired t test was used. Evaluation of Cytokines and Chemokines in Myeloma Cell-Osteoclast Serum-free Co-culture—It has been reported that in co-culture with myeloma cells, osteoclasts support survival and sustained proliferation of freshly purified primary myeloma cells for extended time periods and that this effect requires contact between myeloma cells and osteoclasts (10Yaccoby S. Macleod V. Bendre M. Huang Y. Theus A.M. Miao H.Q. Kussie P. Yaccoby S. Epstein J. Suva L.J. Kelly T. Sanderson R.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 2016-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Here we present confirmation of these results (Figs. 1 and 2) in serum-free conditions which allow easy collection and subsequent identification of soluble secreted proteins from the media. Coculturing myeloma cells with osteoclasts not only inhibits myeloma cell death (Fig. 1) but also promotes myeloma cell proliferation. The influence on cell proliferation is evidenced by the 4.5-fold increase in the proportion of MM PCs in G2/M phase after 2 days of co-culture with osteoclasts (Fig. 2). Before co-culture, 4% of cells were in G2/M; this level increased to 18% after co-culture.Fig. 2Flow cytometric analysis of G2/M phase MM PCs before and after co-culture with osteoclasts.

As a first step toward understanding the mechanisms of myeloma cell-osteoclast interactions, we sought to evaluate changes in the cytokine and chemokine milieu in co-culture conditioned media. This experiment serves two purposes. First, by evaluating previously characterized changes in specific proteins (i.e. MIP, IL-3, and IL-6), we can determine whether our experimental system is functional for identifying changes in the profile of secreted proteins during MM PC-osteoclast co-culture. Second, it allows us to analyze changes in levels of other cytokines and chemokines that have not yet been investigated in this context. We cultured MM PCs and osteoclasts individually and in co-culture and then analyzed the conditioned media using 79-cytokine arrays (RayBiotech, Inc.). These arrays use antibodies to 79 cytokines, along with positive and negative controls, to quantitatively identify these known proteins within conditioned medium. We examined four separate co-cultures and compared them with four individual cultures of MM PCs and osteoclasts. We found that within 6 h of initiating co-culture, IL-6, MIP-1β, MCP-1, GRO, and ENA-78 were consistently up-regulated in all four co-cultures (Fig. 3). IL-7 and IL-10 were up-regulated in two of the four cultures (each with osteoclasts from a different source) (Fig. 3). TNF-α and hepatocye growth factor were up-regulated in only one of the four cultures. Our data confirm the previously reported up-regulation of IL-6 and MIP. IL-1, IL-3, and insulin-like growth factor were not detected in co-culture conditioned media, although they have been reported to be involved in myeloma cell-osteoclast interactions. Our data add three cytokines, MCP-1, GRO, and ENA-78, to the list of proteins potentially involved in the interplay between myeloma cells and their microenvironment. Furthermore, it appears that our serum-free co-culture system provides a simple, useful model to study these interactions. SELDI Analysis of the Secreted Proteome of Myeloma Cell-Osteoclast Co-culture—To identify differences in the secreted proteome of individually cultured versus co-cultured MM PCs and osteoclasts, we used SELDI to analyze conditioned media from these three groups. We found that after 6 h of co-culture, there were about 30 detectable peaks indicating changes before and after co-culture. However, there was one prominent difference between the protein profiles: in co-culture conditioned medium, a 66-kDa protein was up-regulated 4.6-fold over its level in conditioned medium from either MM PCs or osteoclasts cultured alone (Fig. 4). Because the 66-kDa protein was so highly up-regulated in MM PC-osteoclast co-culture, we focused on determining its identity. We used SDS-PAGE to purify the 66-kDa protein and performed tryptic digests on the sample from the excised band. Based on SELDI spectra, we identified the protein as CHSY1 (p = 1) (Fig. 5). CHSY1 is a type II membrane protein with both β1,3-glucuronate transferase and β1,4-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase activities (18Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), as well as a Fringe-like domain (amino acids 87–237; 62.7% homology to Fringe; BLAST analysis, National Center for Biotechnology Information) (19Marchler-Bauer A. Anderson J.B. DeWeese-Scott C. Fedorova N.D. Geer L.Y. He S. Hurwitz D.I. Jackson J.D. Jacobs A.R. Lanczycki C.J. Liebert C.A. Liu C. Madej T. Marchler G.H. Mazumder R. Nikolskaya A.N. Panchenko A.R.

CHSY1 Is Critical to MM PC-Osteoclast Interactions—To determine the functional significance of CHSY1 to the myeloma cell-osteoclast interaction, we designed siRNA experiments to examine the effects of inactivating CHSY1 expression. We designed 21-nucleotide CHSY1 siRNAs and transfected them into OC and then cocultured with MM cells. These double-stranded RNA molecules should specifically suppress levels of their target, CHSY1, at both the mRNA and protein levels. We used three different siRNAs to CHSY1 (siRNA1, -2, and -3) in an effort to increase the effectiveness of CHSY1 inactivation. As a negative control designed to identify changes in gene expression that result from the siRNA delivery method, we used negative GAPDH siRNA, which is not complementary to any gene in our target cells. SELDI analysis of the conditioned media showed markedly reduced levels of CHSY1 in co-cultures of cells carrying transfected siRNA (Fig. 6). To ascertain whether the effect of the siRNA were specific for CHSY1, we used the Ciphergen ProteinChip software protein biology system to quantify three protein peaks identified by SELDI (66 kDa (CHSY1), 44 kDa, and 33 kDa). We confirmed that siRNA treatment did not result in a global reduction of secreted proteins. In fact, the 33-kDa protein was up-regulated in cells carrying siRNA (Fig. 7). Therefore, siRNA treatment significantly reduced the level of secreted CHSY1 in a protein-specific manner.Fig. 7Specific inhibition of chondroitin synthase by siRNA. We quantitated the amounts of three proteins found in 6-h conditioned medium from co-culture, relative to their levels after addition of negative control GAPDH siRNA. Of the three CHSY1 siRNAs tested, siRNA2 and siRNA3 gave consistent effects on myeloma cell death, and siRNA2 is the one with the strongest effect on production of CHSY1. Gray bars represent 66-kDa protein; white bars represent 44-kDa protein, and black bars represent 33-kDa protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the biological impact of CHSY1 suppression on MM PC proliferation and apoptosis. We reasoned that if CHSY1 is critical to MMPC-osteoclast interactions, then specifically reducing its level should alter the protective effect that osteoclasts impart to myeloma cells (see Figs. 1 and 2). Exposure of MM PC-osteoclast co-cultures to CHSY1 siRNAand and co-culture transfected cells for 2 days resulted in an increased number of apoptotic MM PCs (20% apoptosis without siRNA; 48% with siRNA), decreased MM PC viability (83% viability without siRNA; 53% with siRNA), and a 40% reduction in the number of live MM PCs the siRNA negative control (Figs. 1 and 8). Our data suggest that elevating the level of CHSY1 contributes to the high degree of MM PC growth and proliferation that occurs in co-culture with osteoclasts. Notch Signaling Is Involved in MM PC-Osteoclast Interactions—CHSY1 has a Fringe-like domain. Fringe regulates Notch1 and -2 signaling via a well characterized glycosyltransferase that modulates the Notch receptors to specific ligands through glycosylation (11Baron M. Aslam H. Flasza M.

Biol. 2002; 248: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that CHSY1 contributes to myeloma by stimulating Notch2 signaling and inhibiting Notch1 signaling, consistent with the predicted activities of its Fringe-like domain (13Fleming R.J. Gu Y. Hukriede N.A. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2973-2981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we used Western blot analysis to investigate Notch signaling in MM PCs during co-culture with osteoclasts. Activation of a Notch receptor involves cleavage of a 100-kDa segment, which can be identified by Western blot. Release of the 100-kDa peptide indicates activation of the signaling pathway because it is imported into the nucleus where it binds transcriptional regulators and initiates downstream signaling. Our data show that Notch2 is cleaved in co-cultured MM PCs but not in MM PCs cultured alone (Fig. 9). Activation of Notch1 was not detected (data not shown). Our results demonstrate that Notch2 signaling is activated in MM PCs when co-cultured with osteoclasts but not when cultured alone. To determine whether Notch2 activation is due to elevated levels of CHSY1, we utilized our siRNA system. We found that siRNA2 showed the strongest reduction in CHSY1 level and siRNA1 showed the weakest (data not shown). Therefore, we examined the effects of both siRNA1 and -2 on activation of Notch2. We did not detect Notch2 activation in co-cultured cells carrying siRNA2, but cells carrying siRNA1 (with less CHSY1 suppression) activated Notch2. These results suggest that Notch2 activation in MM PCs co-cultured with osteoclasts is dependent on the level of CHSY1. Furthermore, the data are consistent with our hypothesis that CHSY1 contributes to myeloma by activating Notch2 signaling and inhibiting Notch1 signaling via its Fringe-like domain.

https://openalex.org/W2027519034,"UGRP1 is a downstream target gene for homeodomain transcription factor T/EBP/NKX2.1, which is predominantly expressed in lung epithelial cells, and may play an anti-inflammatory role in lung inflammation. To understand the role of UGRP1 in inflammation, its expression was investigated in relation to cytokine signaling. In vivo experiments using mouse embryonic lung organ culture and intranasal administration of interleukin (IL) 10 revealed that constitutive expression of Ugrp1 mRNA is enhanced by IL-10. Increase of protein levels was also demonstrated by immunohistochemistry using embryonic lungs. This IL-10 induction of Ugrp1 gene expression occurs at the transcriptional level when examined using mouse embryonic lung primary cultures. In human lung NCI-H441 cells that in contrast to mouse lung cells, do not exhibit constitutive expression of the gene, expression of the UGRP1 gene was induced in a rapid and stable fashion. Two T/EBP, but not STAT3, binding sites located in the human UGRP1 gene promoter are responsible for IL-10 induction of the UGRP1 gene as judged by transfection, gel shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses. The IL-10 receptor chains, IL-10R1 and IL-10R2, are expressed in H441 cells, however, STAT3 was only weakly activated upon IL-10 treatment. In contrast, STAT3 was strongly activated when the cells were treated with other cytokines such as IL-22 and interferon-β but UGRP1 expression was not increased. Together these results demonstrate that IL-10 induces UGRP1 gene expression in lung epithelial cells through a T/EBP/NKX2.1-dependent pathway. The results further suggest that UGRP1 might be a target for IL-10 anti-inflammatory activities in the lung.

T/EBP is expressed in brain, thyroid, and lung epithelium during embryogenesis and is essential for the genesis of these organs (11Kimura S. Hara Y. Pineau T. Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). In adult lung, the expression of T/EBP is confined to both the conducting airways and type II alveolar epithelial cells (12Yuan B. Li C. Kimura S. Engelhardt R.T. Smith B.R. Minoo P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). UGRP1, officially named Secretoglobin gene family 3A2 (13Niimi T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Srisodsai A. Zimonjic D.B. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Kimura S. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 97: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), is a novel gene encoding a homodimeric secretory protein of ∼10 kDa that is highly expressed in epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchus, and bronchioles (1Niimi T. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Zhou Y. Levitt R.C. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based on our previous results, there is considerable evidence to suggest that UGRP1 may function in the regulation of the local immune response in the lung. First, the human UGRP1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31-q32, a region where one of the asthma susceptibility genes was assigned and genes coding for several Th2-type cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are located (13Niimi T. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Srisodsai A. Zimonjic D.B. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Kimura S. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 97: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the UGRP1 amino acid sequence exhibits similarity to the UG/Clara cell secretory protein, which is known to function as an anti-inflammatory agent via inhibition of phospholipase A2 (1Niimi T. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Zhou Y. Levitt R.C. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Third, a polymorphism (G/A) was identified in the human UGRP1 gene promoter that is associated with an increased risk of asthma in a Japanese population of adult asthmatic patients (14Niimi T.

Lastly, the mRNA level of Ugrp1 is decreased in inflamed mouse lungs, and returns to basal levels following dexamethasone treatment (1Niimi T. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Zhou Y. Levitt R.C. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine that was shown to mediate anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and tissue protective functions. The known IL-10 signaling is through binding to specific receptors IL-10R1 and IL-10R2, which leads to activation of the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) signal transduction pathways (15Donnelly R.P. Dickensheets H. Finbloom D.S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). An anti-inflammatory role for IL-10 was demonstrated by lung cells and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from IL--10(–/–) mice after repeated Aspergillus fumigatus challenge (16Grunig G. Corry D.B. Leach M.W. Seymour B.W. Kurup V.P. Rennick D.M. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which exhibited highly elevated levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ production, and exaggerated airway inflammation compared with wild-type controls. An anti-inflammatory role for IL-10 was also demonstrated by local delivery of IL-10 to the airway of mice using an adenovirus gene transfer system during ovalbumin challenge (17Stampfli M.R. Cwiartka M. Gajewska B.U. Alvarez D. Ritz S.A. Inman M.D. Xing Z. Jordana M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) or Pneumocystis carinii infection (18Ruan S. Tate C. Lee J.J. Ritter T. Kolls J.K. Shellito J.E. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6107-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role for IL-10 in allergic inflammation is the observation that the lungs of asthmatic patients exhibit significantly lower levels of IL-10 when compared with normal controls (19Borish L. Aarons A. Rumbyrt J. Cvietusa P. Negri J. Wenzel S. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 97: 1288-1296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). It is known that IL-10 inhibits: 1) the activation of a specific protein-tyrosine kinase involved in the bacterial lipopolysaccharide signaling pathway including the Ras signaling pathway (20Geng Y. Gulbins E. Altman A. Lotz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8602-8606Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and 2) activation of the NF-κB pathway that is involved in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines by human monocytes (21Wang P. Wu P. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9558-9563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which IL-10 exerts its anti-inflammatory activities on different cell types have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that IL-10 increased constitutive expression of the Ugrp1 gene in mouse lungs when examined by mouse embryonic lung organ culture in the presence of IL-10 and in vivo intranasal instillation of IL-10 to mice. IL-10 also induced UGRP1 gene expression in human lung-derived NCI-H441 cells that do not exhibit constitutive expression of UGRP1. IL-10-modulated Ugrp1 gene expression was regulated at the transcriptional level when examined in primary mouse embryonic lung cells. The IL-10 responsiveness of UGRP1 gene expression is mediated through the binding of T/EBP, but not STAT3, to its specific binding sites in the promoter region of the UGRP1 gene. This is the first demonstration that the homeodomain transcription factor, T/EBP, plays an essential role in mediating the induction of an IL-10 responsive gene in lung epithelial cells, and UGRP1 might be a target for IL-10 anti-inflammatory activities in the lung. Cell Culture, Embryonic Lung Organ Culture, and Materials—Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma NCI-H441 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Mouse embryonic lungs obtained from embryonic day (E) 15.5 pregnant C57BL/6 females were cultured by placing them on 0.4-μm Millipore filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), supported by stainless steel grids in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells/lungs were cultured without serum for 24–48 h before addition of IL-10. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma, and human and mouse IL-10 from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Mouse Intranasal Instillation of IL-10 —Six to 9-week-old 129Sv mice (n = 5 in each group) were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin and allowed to breathe spontaneously. Sterile PBS or various amounts of mouse IL-10 were intranasally instilled into the trachea of each animal. After 24 h, total RNAs were prepared from whole lungs. All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the Using Animals in Intramural Research Guidelines (NIH Animal Research Advisory Committee, NIH, Bethesda, MD) after approval of the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee. Immunohistochemistry—Cultured E15.5 embryonic lungs treated with 50 ng/ml IL-10 for 2 days were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidases, followed by rinsing three times for 5 min each with PBS. Tissues for immunostaining for T/EBP were incubated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 100 °C for 10 min. Tissues were blocked in 5% skim milk for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated overnight with rabbit anti-UGRP1 or anti-T/EBP antibodies produced in our laboratory (1: 500 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively) at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. After washing three times for 5 min in PBS, tissues were processed by the ABC method using a commercially available kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunocomplexes were visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Northern Blotting—Total RNA, extracted from H441 cells or mouse lungs by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.22 m formaldehyde and blotted onto Gene-Screen Plus nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Hybridization was performed in PerfectHyb Plus hybridization buffer (Sigma) at 65 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min, followed by exposure to a Storm PhosphorImager screen and the signals were visualized with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). PCR-based Nuclear Run-on Experiments—Mouse embryonic lung primary culture was used as a source for PCR nuclear run-on experiments. Briefly, E16.5 mouse embryo lungs were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 units/ml Dispase I (Roche Applied Science), and 10,000 units/ml collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. Dispersed cells were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at room temperature. Individual cells were plated out at the density of 1 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well dish and cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight. Cells were then treated with 100 ng/ml IL-10 or mock-treated with PBS for 2 h before harvest in PBS. Harvested cells were lysed by pipetting 10–15 times in 5 volumes of nucleus isolation buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma), and nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei and the supernatant were separately subjected to RNA isolation using TRIzol to obtain nuclear and cytosolic total RNAs. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with ABI Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) to determine the level of Ugrp1 pre- and/or post-processed transcript in the nuclei and/or cytosol. Total RNAs isolated from either nuclei or cytosol were treated with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNAs. Reverse transcription of isolated RNAs was carried out by using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To detect the Ugrp1 transcript, two sets of primers were used (Fig. 2D); F1 (5′-AGTTCATTCAG-GCTTGGTCTTGAC-3′) and R1 (5′-GGAGTTTGTGTTTGCTGC-TATGC-3′) are specific to the sequences in intron 1 and amplify only pre-spliced transcripts, whereas F2 (5′-GGTTATTCTGCCACTGCCCT-TCTC-3′) and R2 (5′-TACCAGGTGTGAAAGAGCCTCCAG-3′) primer sequences are derived from the junctions of exon 1 and 2, and 2 and 3, respectively, and amplify only post-spliced transcripts. Reactions were performed using SYBR Green master mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the following conditions: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for pre-processed specific primers or 62 °C for post-processed specific primers for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 60 s. Data were analyzed by the standard curve method, and normalized for 18 S rRNA, which was measured by using the following primer pair: 5′-CGGCTACCACATCCAAGGAA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATTGGAGCTG-GAATTACCGC-3′(reverse). RT-PCR Analyses—The RT reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing DNase I-pretreated RNA (2.5 μg), 4 μlof5× first strand synthesis buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1 μl of a mixture of four dNTPs (2.5 mm each), 2 μlof0.1 m dithiothreitol, and 50 ng of oligo(dT) primers. After incubation at 42 °C for 2 min, 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added, and the incubation was continued for 50 min. PCR was carried out using 0.5 μl of the reaction mixture, Advantage 2 polymerase (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA), and the following oligonucleotide primers: human IL-10 R1 (forward, 5′-GCTCCTGAGGTATGGAATAGAGTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TA-TGTGTCATTTGCGGGGGC-3′), human IL-10 R2 (forward, 5′-TGGAT-GACACCATTATTGGACCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTTGCTCACAGACAGGC-TCACTC-3′), human IL-22 R1 (forward, 5′-GCCACCAAGATGACTGA-CAGGTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTCTCTGCTTCCCTCCAAGG-3′), and human IL-28 R1 (forward, 5′-AAGTGGAAGAGTGTGCGGGAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGGGGAGTGACTGGAAATAGGGTC-3′). Luciferase Reporter Plasmid Construction and Transfection—Sequence-specific primers were used to generate a series of reporter constructs in pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) containing various lengths of human UGRP1 gene promoter as follows: –31 hUGRP1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCATATAAATATGTGTGTGCAAAAGCAG-3′, –76 hUGRP1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGGTGAGTCAAGTGGTAGGGAC-3′, –100 hUGRP1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCTAACATTTATCCCTTTCTTTGGT-GG-3′, –148 hUGRP1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCAACACACGGGGAAGTGG-AAAAC-3′, –178 hUGRP1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGCTGTACTGTAGAGC-TTTGTTTCTCA-3′, –322 hUGRP1, 5′-GCTGCTAGCTCTCCAAACTT-AAATGATTAGAAAACTG-3′, and 5′-AGATCTCGAGTCTGGGATATT-TTTC-3′ (common reverse primer). The construct –209 hUGRP1 was as previously described (1Niimi T. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Zhou Y. Levitt R.C. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to make pGL3-M1, M2, M1*2, and –76M3 mutant plasmids (mutated nucleotides boldfaced with underline): M1, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGCAAGGGTTTATGCCCGAG-G-3′, M2, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGCAAGGGTTTATGCAAGAGGTACGGG-AGAAT-3′, M1*2, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGCAAGGGTTTATGCCCGAGGT-ACGGGAGAAT-3′, M3, 5′-GCGTGCTAGCGGTGAGTCCCGTGGTAG-GGAC-3′, and 5′-AGATCTCGAGTCTGGGATATTTTTC-3′ (common reverse primer). The PCR fragments were digested with NheI (5′ side) and XhoI, and inserted into the NheI and XhoI sites of the pGL3 plasmid. For mutants M1*3, M2*3, and M1*2*3, the reverse primer 5′-CTGAATTCTAGTCCCTACCACGGGACTCACCCCACC-3′ was used in combination with the above forward primers, and the resultant PCR fragment was digested with NheI and EcoRI (located downstream of the 3rd T/EBP binding site), and swapped with the NheI-EcoRI fragment of the –209 hUGRP1 construct. A series of UGRP1 luciferase reporter constructs and plasmid pRL-TK as a normalization control for transfection efficiency, and pCMV4-T/EBP (22Mizuno K. Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4927-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) or pCMV4 were co-transfected using Opti-MEM media and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) into H441 cells that were preincubated without serum for 24 h. IL-10 (25 ng/ml) was added 12 h after transfection, and 48 h later, cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were determined using the luciferase assay system (Promega). EMSA—Nuclear extracts of NCI-H441 cells were prepared using NE-PER (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used as probes or competitors: GRR (5′-ATGTATTTCCCAGAAA-3′) (23Wehinger J. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Finke J. Mertelsmann R. Weber-Nordt R.M.

Hu Y. Stearns M.E. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 1605-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Nuclear extract (3 μg) and unlabeled oligonucleotide competitor DNAs were preincubated in EMSA buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.6 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/μl pepstatin A, 2 μg/μl leupeptin, and 87 μg/μl poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences)) for 10 min on ice. An oligonucleotide probe (1 × 105 cpm) was added to the mixture and incubated for 20 min on ice. For antibody supershift assay, 1 μl of anti-TTF1 (T/EBP) monoclonal antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) or anti-STAT3 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the mixture and the incubation continued for an additional 30 min. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by 5% nondenaturing PAGE and analyzed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). ChIP—The ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol, except for the sonication procedure that was optimized for NCI-H441 cells. Briefly, pre-cultured H441 cells without serum for 48 h were stimulated with 25 ng/ml IL-10 for 30 min. The DNA-protein structure was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and cells were washed twice with cold PBS, harvested on ice, and spun down. The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and sonicated to shear DNAs to lengths between 600 and 1000 bp. The sonicate was centrifuged and the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl). An aliquot (1% volume) of diluted cell supernatant was saved to use as an input DNA. Salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) was added to the reminder of the supernatant to immunoprecipitate Ab-bound DNA complex, which was divided into three fractions, each containing anti-TTF1 (T/EBP) (DAKO), mIgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or no Ab as a negative control, and was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After washing, the immunoprecipitated protein-DNA complex and the input were incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse protein/DNA cross-linking. Primers used for PCR amplification are as follows: a fragment containing –179 to –209 T/EBP binding sites (forward, 5′-TCCAGGAGA-AGGATTCGTTGGG-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCCCCGTGTGTTCCCATGAG-3′), a fragment containing the –51 to –80 T/EBP binding site (forward, 5′-TCTCATGGGAACACACGGGGAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGTGATGGC-TGCTTTTGCACACAC-3′), or UGRP1 gene exon 3 as a nonspecific control (forward, 5′-GTGGCCAAACAGGACACTGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CGTCCT-TCTGAATAGAGTCC3′). PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel, and visualized and quantitated with Eagle Eye (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Phospho-STAT3 Western Blots—The levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 were measured by Western blotting as previously described (28Kotenko S.V. Gallagher G. Baurin V.V. Lewis-Antes A. Shen M. Shah N.K. Langer J.A. Sheikh F. Dickensheets H. Donnelly R.P. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Briefly, H441 cells were treated with various cytokines (50 ng/ml each) for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of this incubation period, the cells were lysed, and STAT3 protein was immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-STAT3 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The levels of activated STAT3 were measured using a mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). Anti-IL-10R1 Antibody Treatment—H441 cells were pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without a monoclonal antibody (3F9) (5 μg/ml) that was obtained in purified form from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and is known to specifically block the binding of IL-10 to the IL-10 receptor (29Liu Y. de Waal Malefyt R. Briere F. Parham C. Bridon J.M. Banchereau J. Moore K.W. Xu J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 604-613PubMed Google Scholar). IL-10 (50 ng/ml) was then added, and total RNA was prepared for Northern blotting after an additional 6-h incubation period. IL-10 Induces UGRP1 Gene Expression—Ugrp1 mRNA is constitutively expressed in adult as well as embryonic mouse lungs (Fig. 1) (1Niimi T. Keck-Waggoner C.L. Popescu N.C. Zhou Y. Levitt R.C. Kimura S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels were found to be augmented by IL-10 when embryonic day (E) 15.5 lungs were organ-cultured in the presence of IL-10 and mice were intranasally administered IL-10. Thus, the organ-cultured embryonic lungs exhibited an increase in Ugrp1 mRNA levels in a statistically significant time-dependent manner at 48 h after the initiation of IL-10 treatment (Fig. 1A), and intranasal IL-10 administration demonstrated a dose-dependent increase of Ugrp1 mRNA levels after 24 h, with 600 ng being statistically significant (Fig. 1B). When embryonic lungs were subjected to immunohistochemistry, the increase of UGRP1 protein expression after IL-10 treatment was clearly observed as compared with control, whereas no changes were seen for T/EBP expression with or without IL-10 (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that IL-10 enhances Ugrp1 gene expression in mouse lungs. To determine the mechanism for the IL-10 induced increase in UGRP1 mRNA expression, various lung cell lines were analyzed. Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma NCI-H441 cells, which do not demonstrate any constitutive expression of UGRP1, were found to express UGRP1 mRNAs albeit at low levels, upon treatment with IL-10 at 25 and 50 ng/ml (Fig. 2A). The UGRP1 mRNA expression was first observed as early as 2 h after the initiation of treatment, was drastically increased by 4 h, and continued at elevated levels up to 24 h. Interestingly during this period, T/EBP mRNA levels did not significantly change (Fig. 2B). Next, H441 cells were pretreated with either the RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D, or the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 2C). The IL-10 induction of UGRP1 mRNA expression was not observed in the presence of actinomycin D, whereas cycloheximide did not have any effect on IL-10-induced UGRP1 mRNA levels, demonstrating that induction of UGRP1 gene expression by IL-10 in H441 cells requires transcription but not a newly synthesized protein(s). Also, of interest was that T/EBP mRNA expression was completely abolished by actinomycin D treatment. PCR-based nuclear run-on experiments (30Rolfe F.G. Valentine J.E. Sewell W.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 17: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were performed to confirm that the IL-10-induced increase in Ugrp1 mRNA occurred at the transcriptional level. RNA was isolated from nuclei and cytoplasm of primary mouse embryonic lung cells treated with and without IL-10 for 2 h. Specific primers were designed that selectively recognize either pre-processed or post-processed transcripts (Fig. 2D, illustration in upper panel). In the nuclei, the levels of pre-spliced and post-spliced transcripts were, respectively, 13- and 1.6-fold higher with IL-10 treatment than without, whereas in the cytosol, a 3-fold increase of Ugrp1 mRNA levels was obtained as compared with no treatment (Fig. 2D, lower panels). Taken together, the results indicate that IL-10 modulation of UGRP1 gene expression takes place at the transcriptional level. Analysis of UGRP1 Gene Promoter—To determine the transcriptional control site(s) for IL-10 induction, the human UGRP1 gene promoter activity was examined by transient transfection analysis with"
https://openalex.org/W2064644008,"The kinetic mechanism and the metabolic role of pyruvate phosphate dikinase from Entamoeba histolytica were investigated. The initial velocity patterns in double reciprocal plots were parallel for the phosphoenolpyruvate/AMP and phosphoenolpyruvate/pyrophosphate substrate pairs and intersecting for the AMP/pyrophosphate pair. This suggests a kinetic mechanism with two independent reactions. The rate of ATP synthesis at saturating and equimolar concentrations of phosphoenolpyruvate, AMP, and pyrophosphate was inhibited by phosphate, which is consistent with an ordered steady-state mechanism. Enzyme phosphorylation by [32Pi]pyrophosphate depends on the formation of a ternary complex between AMP, pyrophosphate, and pyruvate phosphate dikinase. In consequence, the reaction that involves the AMP/pyrophosphate pair follows a sequential steady-state mechanism. The product inhibition patterns of ATP and phosphate versus phosphoenolpyruvate were noncompetitive and uncompetitive, respectively, suggesting that these products were released in an ordered process (phosphate before ATP). The ordered release of phosphate and ATP and the noncompetitive inhibition patterns of pyruvate versus AMP and versus pyrophosphate also supported the sequential kinetic mechanism between AMP and pyrophosphate. Taken together, our data provide evidence for a uni uni bi bi pingpong mechanism for recombinant pyruvate phosphate dikinase from E. histolytica. The ΔG value for the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (+2.7 kcal/mol) determined under near physiological conditions indicates that the synthesis of ATP is not thermodynamically favorable in trophozoites of E. histolytica.

Pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) 1The abbreviations used are: PPDK, pyruvate phosphate dikinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPi, pyrophosphate, Pi, inorganic phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; rEhPPDK, recombinant pyruvate phosphate dikinase from Entamoeba histolytica; Ps, Propionibacterium shermanii; Cs, Clostridium symbiosum; TUU, tri uni uni ping-pong mechanism; UUBB, uni uni bi bi ping-pong mechanism. catalyzes the reversible conversion of AMP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and pyrophosphate (PPi) to ATP, pyruvate (Pyr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The enzyme is found in bacteria such as Propionibacterium shermanii (1Evans H.J. Wood H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Clostridium symbiosum (2Reeves R.E. Menzies R.A. Hsu D.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 34: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), in the protists Entamoeba histolytica (6Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3202-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Giardia lamblia (7Hrdý I. Mertens E. Nohýnková E. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), trypanosomatids, and Euglena (8Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci .U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and in a thermophilic actinomyces microorganism (9Eisaki N. Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Horiuchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The functional role of PPDK depends on the organism. For example, it is well established that PPDK is responsible for the synthesis of the primary CO2 acceptor (PEP) in the C4 cycle (10Edwards G. Nakamoto H. Burnell J. Hatch M. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 255-286Crossref Google Scholar). PPDK also synthesizes PEP in P. shermanii, Acetobacter xylinum, Rhodospirillum rubrum, Microbispora rosea (9Eisaki N. Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Horiuchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Rhizobium meliloti (11Østerås M. Driscoll B. Finan T. Microbiol. 1997; 143: 1639-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, in E. histolytica, G. lamblia, C3 plants, and trypanosomatids the role of PPDK has not been determined. In the reaction catalyzed by PPDK the transfer of the phosphoryl groups from PEP and PPi to AMP is mediated by a catalytic histidine (His) residue (12Herzberg O. Chen C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L. Noh S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This residue rotates 45 Å from the PEP/Pyr domain to the AMP-ATP/PPi-Pi domain after its phosphorylation by PEP (12Herzberg O. Chen C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L. Noh S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and is also phosphorylated by a phosphoryl group derived from PPi (13Thrall S.H. Mehl A.F. Carroll L.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Enzymes that have functional and amino acid sequence similarities to PPDK, such as enzyme I of the bacterial PEP-sugar phosphotransferase system (14Ginsburg A. Peterkofsky A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and PEP synthase (12Herzberg O. Chen C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L. Noh S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), show the same mechanism of phosphoryl group transfer. Previous studies on PPDK from P. shermanii (PsPPDK) and C. symbiosum (CsPPDK) described two different kinetic mechanisms. The initial velocity patterns between PEP, AMP, and PPi determined for PsPPDK yielded sets of parallel lines in the double reciprocal plots (15Milner Y. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that each substrate participates in an individual partial reaction according to a non-classical tri uni uni ping pong mechanism (TUU) (Scheme 1). The term non-classical in this mechanism refers to a proposal of three physically and catalytically independent sites (15Milner Y. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the initial velocity patterns for the CsPPDK (16Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the PPDK from C4 plants (10Edwards G. Nakamoto H. Burnell J. Hatch M. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 255-286Crossref Google Scholar), were intersecting for AMP/PPi, and parallel for PEP/AMP and PEP/PPi. This suggests two partial reactions in a non-classical uni uni bi bi ping pong mechanism (UUBB) (Scheme 2). This mechanism has been labeled as non-classical because the patterns of product inhibition (16Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J.

In this regard, the mechanism that best describes the kinetics of EhPPDK (Schemes 1 and 2) has not been established. Therefore the present study was carried out to determine the kinetic mechanism of rEhPPDK. In addition we determined the intracellular concentrations of the substrates and products of PPDK, in order to evaluate the metabolic role of PPDK in E. histolytica, because there is a lack of information on this relevant subject. rEhPPDK was overexpressed and purified from the Escherichia coli strain BL21DE3pLysS, as described in Ref. 17Saavedra-Lira E.

A minor modification was the addition of one tablet of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free tablets from Roche Diagnostics) to 10 ml of bacterial extract at the beginning of the procedure. Initial Velocity Studies—The rate of the reaction catalyzed by PPDK was determined in the direction of pyruvate synthesis by coupling lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (13 units/ml, Roche Diagnostics) and following the consumption of NADH (0.2 mm) at 340 nm. The reaction was assayed at 25 °C in 50 mm imidazole buffer at pH 6.3 and in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 (total) and 4.5 mm NH4Cl. The initial velocity studies were analyzed by non-linear regression (Micrococal Origin version 6) by fitting the data to the corresponding equations of steady-state ordered, ping-pong, and rapid equilibrium random bi bi mechanisms (Equations 1, 2, and 1, respectively). In Equations 1 and 2, v = initial velocity, Vmax = maximal velocity, [A] and [B], KA and KB are the concentration and Michaelis-Menten constants of substrates A and B, respectively, and Kia is the dissociation constant for substrate A.v=Vmax×[A][B]KiaKB+KAB+KBA+[A][B](Eq. 1) v=Vmax×[A][B][A][B]+KBA+KAB(Eq. 2) Product Inhibition Studies—Initial velocities of EhPPDK were determined in the absence and in the presence of the inhibitor product at various concentrations of one substrate and constant concentrations of the other two co-substrates. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.3), 7 mm free Mg2+ (added as MgCl2 and determined by using the computer program Chelator, Ref. 18Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (876–879): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar) and 4.5 mm NH4Cl at 25 °C. With the exception of the experiments where Pyr was used as a product inhibitor, the reaction was coupled to the NADH lactate dehydrogenase system. When inhibition by Pyr was studied, the rate of ATP formation was measured by coupling the EhPPDK reaction to hexokinase from yeast (5 units/ml from Roche Diagnostics), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (5 units/ml from Roche Diagnostics). The reaction medium also contained 0.5 mm NADP+, 5 mm glucose, 8 mm MgCl2 (total), 0.1 mm PEP, 0.1 mm AMP, 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.3), and 4.5 mm NH4Cl. Data obtained from product inhibition studies were analyzed by both linear (double reciprocal plots) and non-linear regression (see equations below). The data were computer-fitted to equations for linear competitive inhibition, linear uncompetitive inhibition, and linear noncompetitive inhibition (Equations 3, 4, and 5, respectively). v=Vmax[A]KA×(1+[I]Kis)+[A](Eq. 3) v=Vmax[A]KA+[A]×(1+[I]Kji)(Eq. 4) v=Vmax[A]KA×(1+[I]Kis)+[A]×(1+[I]Kii)(Eq. 5) [I] is the inhibitor concentration; Kii is the inhibitor constant that affects the intercept (1/Vmax); Kis is the inhibitor constant that affects the slope (Km/Vmax); the other terms are the same as those defined for Equations 1 and 2. The experiments of inhibition by Pi were designed according to the kinetic equations for a UUBB ping-pong mechanism, assuming either a steady-state ordered mechanism (Equation 6), or a rapid equilibrium random mechanism (Equation 7) for the binding of AMP and PPi. These two equations were determined using the computer program REFERASS (19Varon R. García-Sevilla F. García-Moreno M. García-Canovas F. Peyro R. Duggleby R.G. Comput. Appl. Sci. 1997; 13: 159-167PubMed Google Scholar). At equimolar concentrations of the three substrates of the reaction (PEP, PPi, and AMP) and in presence of the product Pi (Q), but in the absence of the other two products (ATP and Pyr), the following Equations 8 and 9 are derived from Equations 6 and 7.v=VfVr([ABC]−[PQR]Keq)VrKiBKC[A]+VrKC [AB]+VrKB[AC]+VfKeqKiRKQ[P]+VfKeqKR[PQ]+VrKiBKCKiQ[AQ]+VfKeqKQ[PR]+VfKeqKP[QR]+VfKeqKQ[PR]+VrKA[BC]+VfKeqKiRKQKiC[CP]+VrKCKiQ[ABQ]+VfKeqKRKiA[APQ]+VfKeqKPKCB[BQR]+VrKAKiP[ACP]+VrKAKiR[BCR]+VfKeqKPKiB[BQR]+VrKCKiQKiiC[ABQC]+VfKeqKQKiC[CPR]+VfKeqKQKiCKiiQ[CPR]+VrKAKiRKiiC[BCQR]+Vr[ABC]+VfKeq[PQR]+VfKeqKiRKQKiA[AP](Eq. 6) v=VfVr([ABC]−[PQR]Keq)VrKiBKC[A]+VfKeqKiQKR[P]+VrKB [AC]+VrKC[AB]+VrKQ[BC]+VrKiBKCKiP[AP]+VfKeqKR[PQ]+VfKeqKP[QR]+VfKeqKQ[PR]+Vr[ABC]+VfKeq[PQR]+VrKAKiQ[BCQ]+VfKeqKPKiC[CQR]+VfKeqKPKiB[BQR]+VrKAKiR[BCR]+VrKAKiQKiiR[BCQR](Eq. 7) v=Vf[A]3coefa+coefa2[A]2+(1+Kc×[Q]KiQ×KiiC)×[A]3(Eq. 8) v=Vf×[A]3coefa×[A]+coefa2×[A]2+[A]3(Eq. 9) At saturating concentrations of the three substrates, Equations 8 and 9 simplify to Equations 10 and 11, respectively.Vmax=Vf1+KcKiQ×Kiic×[Q](Eq. 10) Vf=Vmax(Eq. 11) In Equations 6, 7 and 8, 9, and 10, 11: Vf is the maximal velocity for the synthesis of ATP; Vr is the maximal velocity for the synthesis of PEP; [A], [B], and [C] are the concentrations of substrates PEP, AMP, and PPi, respectively; [P], [Q], and [R] are the concentrations of products Pyr, Pi, and ATP, respectively; Keq is the equilibrium constant of the reaction; Ki is the dissociation constant of the substrate or the product that is indicated next as a subindex in capitals; K is the Michaelis-Menten constant of the product or substrate that is indicated. In Equations 8 and 9, A is the equimolar concentration of each substrate. For Equation 8, coefa = KiB KC +KiAKC[Q]KiQ and coefa2 = KB + KC + KA + KC[Q]/KiQ. For Equation 9, coefa = KiBKC and coefa2 = KA + KB + KC + KA [Q]/KiQ. The initial velocity in these experiments was determined at different concentrations of Pi and constant and saturating concentrations of AMP, PPi, and PEP (1 mm). Pyrophosphorylation of rEhPPDK with 32PPi—The reaction was started by the addition of rEhPPDK (0.4 mg of protein, equivalent to 1.04 nmol) to 500 μl of medium containing 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.3), 10 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm NH4Cl, 2 mm32PPi (∼14 μCi; Perkin Elmer), and the indicated substrates. The reaction was stopped after 0.5–1.5 s of incubation at room temperature by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Longer times of incubation (30–60 s) did not increase the 32Pi incorporation into PPDK. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed; the precipitated protein was washed another five times with 10% trichloroacetic acid. It was finally resuspended in 1.5 ml of 10% SDS and mixed with 5.5 ml of water. The covalent incorporation of 32Pi into rEhPPDK was determined in a Beckman LS100C counter by measuring the Cerenkov radiation. Intracellular Content of Metabolites—Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM1 IMSS were grown axenically at 37 °C in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% adult bovine serum and 3% of a vitamin mixture. The cultured cells (∼1 × 108) were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in SHE buffer (250 mm sucrose, 100 mm Hepes pH 7, and 1 mm EGTA) and washed twice with the same buffer. The cells were then mixed with 3% (v/v) perchloric acid/20 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 800 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was recovered, neutralized, and conserved at –70 °C until use. The intracellular concentration of substrates and products of the reaction catalyzed by EhPPDK were determined by using standard enzymatic and colorimetric assays (20Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VI & VII. Editorial VCH, Germany1986: 118-501Google Scholar), except for AMP and PPi, in which rEhPPDK was used. Because the true substrates of PPDK, like PEP, PPi, and ATP, are complexes with Mg2+, the total concentration of this metal was also determined. E. histolytica trophozoites (1 × 107 cells/0.2 ml) were mixed with 1 ml of 70% nitric acid and 1 ml of 98% sulfuric acid and heated for 40 min. The magnesium content in the digested extracts was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry in a Varian apparatus. The intracellular volume used to calculate the metabolite concentration was 13 μl/107 cells. This corresponds to the volume reported for bovine alveolar macrophages, which are morphologically very similar to trophozoites from E. histolytica (21Scorneaux B. Shryock T.R. J. Vet. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 22: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Determination of Keq and ΔG—The determination of ΔG for the reaction PEP + AMP + PPi [lrarr2] Pyr + ATP + Pi required the measurement of the equilibrium constant (Keq) at 37 °C and pH 6.3 (the assumed in vivo conditions for E. histolytica). The Keq of the reaction catalyzed by EhPPDK was estimated in these conditions from the concentration of Pi and ATP at equilibrium. The initial concentrations were 0.05 mm PEP, 0.05 mm AMP, and 0.035 mm PPi. rEhPPDK Purity and Stability—The densitometric analysis of the SDS-electrophoresis gel routinely showed purity greater than 90% for all rEhPPDK used in these experiments. The stability of the enzyme stored in imidazole buffer was increased by adding a commercially available mixture of protease inhibitors. Enzyme activity remained stable for at least 60 days at room temperature (data not shown). Kinetic Mechanism—Initial velocities of EhPPDK were determined at variable concentrations of one of the substrates with fixed variable concentrations of the second and a constant concentration of the third substrate. The kinetic patterns and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constants obtained by nonlinear regression analysis are summarized in Table I. The patterns for PEP and PPi (concentration of AMP constant) and PEP and AMP (concentration of PPi constant) were parallel, indicating a ping-pong kinetic mechanism for PEP versus PPi and AMP. The pattern for AMP and PPi (concentration of PEP constant) was intersecting (Fig. 1); the same pattern was obtained when AMP was the variable substrate, suggesting that these substrates have a sequential kinetic mechanism in which AMP or PPi binds first (ordered mechanism), or one in which either substrate binds first (random mechanism). This intersecting pattern (Fig. 1) suggested that the reaction catalyzed by EhPPDK involves a partial reaction in which a ternary AMP-EP-PPi complex is formed.Table IObserved kinetic patterns and apparent Michaelis constantsSubstrateObserved patternVariedVariable fixedFixedaConcentrations were PEP, 0.6 mm; PPi, 1 mm; AMP, 0.6 mm.rEhPPDKbThis work.Km appcKm app, mean ± S.D. of four different enzyme preparations for rEhPPDK. rEhPPDKCsPPDKdRef. 15.PsPPDKeRef. 1.mmPEPAMPPPiparallel0.024 ± 0.012parallelparallelPEPPPiAMPparallel0.032 ± 0.010parallelparallelAMPPEPPPiparallel0.004 ± 0.001parallelparallelAMPPPiPEPintersecting0.023 ± 0.011intersectingparallelPPiPEPAMPparallel0.062 ± 0.023parallelparallelPPiAMPPEPintersecting0.126 ± 0.031intersectingparallela Concentrations were PEP, 0.6 mm; PPi, 1 mm; AMP, 0.6 mm.b This work.c Km app, mean ± S.D. of four different enzyme preparations for rEhPPDK.d Ref. 15Milner Y.

A. 1968; 61: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar. Open table in a new tab These patterns (Table I) corresponded to those predicted for a UUBB ping-pong kinetic mechanism. Identical double-reciprocal patterns were reported for the PPDK from C. symbiosum under similar conditions (16Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas the AMP/PPi patterns were parallel for the enzyme from P. shermanii (15Milner Y. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is the main difference between these two kinetic mechanisms (shown in Schemes 1 and 2). Product Inhibition Studies—The intersecting pattern of the AMP/PPi pair (Fig. 1) may result from three different sequential kinetic mechanisms: a random rapid-equilibrium, a steady-state ordered or a steady-state random mechanisms (22Segel I. Enzyme Kinetics. Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 560-590Google Scholar). In an attempt to discern between the three of them, initial velocity data determined with different concentrations of Pi, were analyzed using Equations 10 and 11. Equation 10 predicts that in a UUBB ping-pong mechanism, with a steady-state ordered addition of AMP and PPi, the second product (Pi) will inhibit the enzyme activity. In contrast, Equation 11 predicts that in a UUBB ping-pong mechanism with a random rapid equilibrium for the reaction between AMP/PPi, the effect of Pi on the initial rate is negligible in the presence of saturating and equimolar concentrations of the three substrates. The equation considering a steady-state random mechanism between these substrates was not derived because its analysis is exceedingly complex. Thus, based on Equations 10 and 11, the hyperbolic decay in the plot of apparent maximal velocity versus Pi concentration (Fig. 2) suggested that the interaction of the enzyme with AMP and PPi could not be explained by a random rapid equilibrium mechanism. To distinguish between steady-state random and ordered mechanisms other product inhibition patterns were examined. These were determined by measuring the initial velocity catalyzed by PPDK as a function of a variable substrate, in the direction of ATP synthesis. The results from these experiments are summarized in Table II. The product inhibition patterns for Pi versus AMP and PPi, and ATP versus PPi and AMP, were noncompetitive (Table II), indicating that Pi and ATP, and PPi and AMP bind to different enzyme forms and indicating that substrates and products were reversibly interconnected. This may occur in the pyrophosphorylated form of the enzyme (EPP), because the AMP/PPi and ATP/Pi pairs participate in the same reversible partial reaction. The noncompetitive inhibition exerted by ATP against AMP (Table II) also supported a reversible conversion between these two ligands.Table IIProduct inhibition patterns for rEhPPDKProduct inhibitorVaried substrateCosubstratesObserved patternKisKiimmmmmmPiPEPPPi, AMP (0.1)UaU, uncompetitive inhibition.-7.2 ± 0.8 (3)bThe number of experiments is shown in parentheses.PiAMPPPi (1), PEP(0.6)NCcNC, noncompetitive inhibition.44 ± 888 ± 15 (3)PiPPiPEP, AMP (0.6)NC23 ± 846 ± 15 (3)ATPPEPPPi, AMP (0.1)NC0.14 ± .0117 ± 8 (2)ATPAMPPEP, PPi (0.1)NC-0.45 (2)ATPPPiPEP, AMP (0.1)NC5.1 ± 115 ± 3 (3)PyrAMPPEP, PPi (0.1)NC-22.6 (2)PyrPPiPEP, AMP (0.1)NC2.3 ± 0.50.4 ± 0.1 (3)a U, uncompetitive inhibition.b The number of experiments is shown in parentheses.c NC, noncompetitive inhibition. Open table in a new tab The release order for ATP and Pi was determined from their product inhibition patterns against PEP. The kinetic prediction for an ordered mechanism between these two products is that the last product released should act as a competitive inhibitor against PEP, whereas the first released product is an uncompetitive inhibitor. For a random mechanism, the prediction is noncompetitive inhibition by both products. The inhibition patterns (Table II) showed that ATP and Pi were released in an ordered sequence, although in a non-classical manner, since the observed inhibition patterns did not strictly correspond to those expected. The uncompetitive inhibition of Pi against PEP indicated that these ligands bind to different enzyme forms and that Pi was released before ATP. However the noncompetitive inhibition of ATP versus PEP did not fit the predicted pattern for the last released product. Alternative explanations for this noncompetitive inhibition are the formation of dead-end complexes, the existence of an iso mechanism (23Northrop D.B. Rebholz K.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), or the existence of a non-classical UUBB ping-pong mechanism (15Milner Y. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wang H.C. Ciskanik L. Dunaway-Mariano D. von der Saal W. Villafranca J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Evidence for the presence of dead-end complexes with ATP came from noncompetitive inhibition by GMP with respect to AMP (data not shown). The data suggested that GMP and AMP bind to the same enzyme form (EP), but that GMP interacts with another form, possibly the free enzyme, leading to a deadend complex. This finding agrees with the noncompetitive pattern observed for ATP versus PEP and with the existence of dead-end complexes. Another explanation for the noncompetitive inhibition of ATP versus PEP is an iso mechanism; this involves a rate-limiting step associated with isomerization of the free enzyme in the catalytic cycle. In this mechanism, the free enzyme that binds the first substrate is conformationally different from the free enzyme form that binds the last product released. Thus, the inhibition pattern between the first substrate and the last product is noncompetitive, instead of competitive (23Northrop D.B. Rebholz K.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). PPDK exhibits two-site catalysis with two independent active sites separated by 45 Å. To complete a catalytic cycle the enzyme undergoes a transition between two different conformations, which have been identified by x-ray crystallography in the protein from C. symbiosum (12Herzberg O. Chen C. Kapadia G. McGuire M. Carroll L. Noh S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2652-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 24Herzberg O. Chen C.C. Liu S. Tempczyk A. Howard A. Wei M. Ye D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A full catalytic turnover involves a transition of conformer 1 to conformer 2 that brings the dissociation of the products AMP/PPi from their active site, preparing the enzyme for catalysis at the PEP/Pyr active site (25Wei M. Li Z. Ye D. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41156-41165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The partial reaction involving PEP/Pyr in CsPPDK is slower than the partial reaction involving ATP/Pi. It has been proposed that the movement of the central domain between the C-terminal and N-terminal domains could be the rate-limiting step (26Xu Y. McGuire M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Martin B.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2195-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence identity among PPDKs (50–60%) suggests a conserved structure and the same catalytic conformers for rEhPPDK. The putative presence of two different conformers for the free enzyme could explain the noncompetitive inhibition by ATP with respect to PEP. However, a simpler explanation for the noncompetitive inhibition of ATP versus PEP, which is supported by our data, is that EhPPDK catalysis occurs through a non-classical kinetic mechanism (two independent sites), like the one mentioned previously for CsPPDK. The binding order between AMP and PPi was determined from the Pyr inhibition patterns. Competitive inhibition by Pyr with respect to the first substrate and noncompetitive inhibition with respect to the second substrate is predicted for a classical UUBB kinetic mechanism. The noncompetitive inhibition by Pyr with respect to PPi suggested that this substrate binds after AMP. However, the inhibition pattern of Pyr with respect to AMP was also noncompetitive, suggesting that the kinetic mechanism between AMP and PPi could be random (because the Pyr inhibition with both substrates was of the same type). Alternatively, these inhibition patterns may correspond to and support the non-classical mechanism mentioned above. Thus, Pyr may bind to the binary complex EPAMP, and AMP to the PyrEP complex since both substrates bind to different sites (Scheme 3). There are experimental data of Pyr inhibition against PPi at saturating concentrations of AMP and of the inhibition patterns predicted from the equation derived from Scheme 3 that support the formation of the PyrEPAMP dead end complex (data not shown). The patterns of Pyr inhibition versus AMP and PPi were not reported for CsPPDK, but they were determined for PsPPDK (15Milner Y. Wood H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7920-7928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This last enzyme exhibited noncompetitive inhibition for Pyr versus both AMP and PPi. Pyrophosphorylation of rEhPPDK with 32PPi—It was found that 21 ± 3% of rEhPPDK bound 32Pi covalently in the presence of 32PPi + PEP + AMP in the reaction mixture and 5.7 ± 0.7% with either 32PPi, 32PPi + AMP or 32PPi + PEP (Table III). The higher incorporation of 32Pi into the enzyme in the presence of 32PPi + PEP + AMP, compared with 32PPi + PEP (Table III), suggests that the phosphorylated enzyme produced in the first partial reaction (PEP → pyruvate) does not catalyze the second phosphorylation from 32PPi in the absence of AMP. This finding suggested that the ternary complex EP-AMP-PPi was essential for the pyrophosphorylation of rEhPPDK. The pyrophosphorylated PPDK form was originally identified by following the time course of catalysis of CsPPDK with [γ-32P]ATP, in which the steady-state E-PP concentration diminished by increasing the Pi concentration, which is the first phosphate acceptor in the kinetic mechanism for the PEP synthesis (13Thrall S.H. Mehl A.F. Carroll L.J. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Table IIIIncorporation of 32Pi (from PPi) into rEhPPDKAssay componentsnmol 32Pi/nmol rEhPPDKPercentage of 32Pi incorporated into rEhPPDK32PPi (2 mm)0.077 ± 0.0207.4 ± 2.0 (3)aThe number of experiments is shown in parentheses.32PPi (2 mm) + AMP (0.6 mm)0.048 ± 0.0155.2 ± 1.2 (3)32PPi (2 mm) + PEP (0.6 mm)0.067 ± 0.0126.2 ± 0.5 (3)32PPi (2 mm) + PEP (0.6 mm) + AMP (0.6 mm)0.211 ± 0.03221.0 ± 3.1 (11)a The number of experiments is shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Although these results did not establish the binding order between AMP and PPi, they indicated that the second partial reaction was sequential and corresponded to a UUBB pingpong mechanism (supporting the data reported in Table I and Fig. 1) instead of a TUU mechanism. The incorporation of 32Pi into the enzyme in the absence of PEP was unexpected (Table III), because, in all mechanisms, PEP is the first substrate that binds to PPDK producing the phosphorylated form (EP), which in turn reacts with either AMP or PPi. However, this incorporation could be caused by the high concentration of 32PPi used (2 mm). This finding complicates the kinetic mechanism proposed for rEhPPDK because it suggests that the free enzyme may also bind PPi as the first phosphate group donor. It has been reported that with 1 mm of each of the three substrates, 10 mm MgCl2 and after 70 min of reaction in presence of EhPPDK at 25 °C, ADP is generated in addition to Pi, pyruvate and ATP at a concentration 10 times lower than that of ATP (6Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3202-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ADP could be synthesized by phosphorylation of EhPPDK in an incomplete catalytic cycle, requiring only one phosphate donor, perhaps PPi, in addition to AMP. This observation supports the notion that PPi binds to the free enzyme, as shown here. However, in order to simplify the kinetic scheme of EhPPDK (Scheme 3) the PPi-enzyme complex and other dead end complexes were disregarded. Metabolic Role: Substrate and Product Concentrations—The concentrations of metabolites involved in the PPDK reaction were determined in extracts of E. histolytica (Table IV). Using these values we estimated the mass action constant (KMA) of 12.7 in Equation 12.KMA=[Pyr][Pi][ATP][PEP][PPi][AMP](Eq. 12) Table IVConcentrations of metabolites related to the reaction catalyzed by PPDKSubstratenmol/107 cellsmmPEP10.4 ± 4.0 (n = 3)an, number of experiments.0.8 ± 0.2AMP12.3 ± 5.2 (n = 6)0.95 ± 0.31PPi5.3 ± 1.4 (n = 6)0.41 ± 0.12Pyr5.8 ± 2.5 (n = 5)0.45 ± 0.11ATP13.7 ± 6.0 (n = 7)1.05 ± 0.41Pi108.7 ± 50.4 (n = 4)8.36 ± 3.22a n, number of experiments.

This concentration is high enough to assume safely that Mg-PEP, Mg-PPi, and Mg-ATP (the true substrates) are formed. Our data of the concentrations of PEP, Pyr, and PPi were in the same order of magnitude of those reported by Reeves et al. (0.21 ± 0.09 mm and 0.38 ± 0.11 mm, 0.35 ± 0.09 mm, respectively, Ref. 27Reeves R.E. Warren L.G. Guthrie J.D. Arch. Invest. Med. 1974; 5: 331-336Google Scholar). Also, the concentration of ATP was in the same order of magnitude, but it was approximately two times higher than the value reported before, 1.05 ± 0.41 mm (Table IV) and 0.40 ± 0.08 mm (27Reeves R.E. Warren L.G. Guthrie J.D. Arch. Invest. Med. 1974; 5: 331-336Google Scholar). These differences may result from using different E. histolytica strains and/or different growth and incubation conditions. PPDK catalyzes PEP synthesis in C4 plants (10Edwards G. Nakamoto H. Burnell J. Hatch M. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 255-286Crossref Google Scholar). It is localized in chloroplasts of mesophyll cells, which have a pH of 8 in the stroma, and where the reaction is coupled with pyrophosphatases and adenylate kinases (10Edwards G. Nakamoto H. Burnell J. Hatch M. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1985; 36: 255-286Crossref Google Scholar). It has been estimated that, under physiological conditions, the reaction catalyzed by CsPPDK goes toward the synthesis of ATP (ΔG ≈ –1 kcal/mol, Ref. 28Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, in that work the authors used the concentrations of the metabolites reported for E. coli and not those of C. symbiosum (28Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D.

A PEP synthesizing role has been proposed for PPDK in other organisms such as P. shermanii and M. rosea from the measurement of its activity in different growth media (1Evans H.J. Wood H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Eisaki N. Tatsumi H. Murakami S. Horiuchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Other authors have suggested that PPDK catalyzes synthesis of ATP in parasite protists such as E. histolytica and Giardia intestinalis because of the lack of pyruvate kinase in these organisms. However, it is noted that recent works showed in G. intestinalis (31Park J.H. Schofield P.J. Edwards M.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and E. histolytica trophozoites (32Saavedra E. Olivos A. Encalada R. Moreno-Sánchez R. Exp. Parasitol. 2004; 106: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have significant pyruvate kinase activity. Thus, it was judged relevant to evaluate the metabolic role of PPDK in E. histolytica under near physiological conditions. At pH 6.3, 37 °C and the initial concentrations of substrates and Mg2+ (which were in excess over those of the metabolites) described under “Experimental Procedures,” the reaction catalyzed by PPDK reached equilibrium after 40 min (data not shown). The equilibrium concentrations were 0.04 mm for Pi, and 0.015 mm for ATP and pyruvate. The equilibrium concentrations of AMP (0.035 mm), PEP (0.035 mm), and PPi (0.01 mm) were calculated by subtracting the concentration of ATP at equilibrium from the initial substrate concentrations. With these values, the equilibrium constant for the reaction was calculated (Keq = 0.73; ΔG° = + 0.19 kcal/mol). This value differed from that reported for the reaction catalyzed by CsPPDK (333 for the same reaction at 25 °C, 5 mm MgCl2 and pH 7, Ref. 28Mehl A. Xu Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In both cases, the Keq was determined without considering the concentration of protons. This parameter could be important because it has been reported that the reaction catalyzed by EhPPDK requires 2 μmol of H+ for each μmol of ATP synthesized in the pH range of 6.5–8.4, and in the presence of 8.3 mm MgCl2 (a limiting concentration when compared with the metabolite concentrations we used), and presumably at room temperature (2Reeves R.E. Menzies R.A. Hsu D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 5486-5491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, proton consumption of the reaction at pH 6.3 (assay conditions) was measured following the fluorescence of pyranine. The value obtained was 1.7 ± 0.1 μmol of H+, which was in full agreement with that reported by Reeves (6Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3202-3204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, proton consumption was not considered explicitly in the calculation of ΔG, since KMA and Keq were determined at pH 6.3, and the concentration of protons cancels in the equation for the determination of ΔG (+2.7 kcal/mol). Therefore, it seems that in the assumed physiological conditions for amoeba trophozoites the PPDK reaction is not to close to its thermodynamic equilibrium. In consequence, net ATP synthesis catalyzed by PPDK should be expected when substrates accumulate and products diminish under particular metabolic conditions of the trophozoites. The apparent lack of pyrophosphatases (34McLaughlin J. Lindmark D.G. Muller M. Arch. Invest. Med. 1978; 9: 141-148PubMed Google Scholar) together with an active vacuolar proton-transporting ATPase, which acidifies the intravacuolar milieu and that is involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and erythrocytes (33Ghosh K.S. Samuelson J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4243-4249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yi Y. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), may fulfill the required conditions for driving the synthesis of ATP by EhPPDK.

https://openalex.org/W1991472810,"Cardiac-restricted transcription factors dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C are expressed in the developing heart and activate several cardiac promoters. However, their regulatory mechanisms are still to be understood. To elucidate their exact regulatory functions, we have developed an RNA interference strategy to specifically inhibit dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C protein production in H9c2 cells, which are derived from rat embryonic heart. Expression of endogenous cardiac genes atrial natriuretic peptide and α-myosin heavy chain was down-regulated in H9c2 cells lacking both dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C, indicating that these factors are required for the maintenance of the cardiac genetic program. Consistent with these, expression of atrial natriuretic peptide and α-myosin heavy chain was up-regulated in H9c2 cells, which overexpressed dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C. In addition, dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C interact to synergistically activate atrial natriuretic peptide and α-myosin heavy chain transcription. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in H9c2 cells treated with phenylephrine showed that dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C protein complex bind to the A/T sequence on atrial natriuretic peptide promoter. Taken together, these results not only suggest that the complex cis-trans interaction of dHAND, myocyte enhancer factor 2C, and the target gene may fine-tune gene expression in cardiac myocytes but also provide a molecular paradigm to elucidate the mechanisms of action of dHAND and myocyte enhancer factor 2C in the developing heart.

The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; MEF2C, myocyte enhancer factor 2C; MADS box, MCM1, agamous, deficiens, serum response factor box; ANP, atria1 natriuretic peptide; α-MHC, α-myosin heavy chain; RNAi, RNA interference; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PE, phenylephrine; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. transcription factors are a large family of genes that play important roles in determination and differentiation of diverse cell types including skeletal cells, hematopoietic cells, some neuronal cells, and cardiomyocytes. The bHLH proteins contain the basic region and the HLH domain. The basic region can bind to the E-box consensus sequence (CANNTG), and the HLH domain can mediate homodimerization or heterodimerization. This family can be divided into several subgroups based either on their structure, DNA binding activity, or expression pattern during development. Tissue-specific bHLH proteins compose the largest subgroup and bind the E-box element (CANNTG) of target gene by dimerization with a ubiquitously expressed bHLH factors, the E protein. In addition, transcriptional activity of the tissue-specific bHLH proteins requires association with other bHLH proteins or non-bHLH proteins (1Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12604-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, in skeletal muscle cells the muscle bHLH protein MyoD regulates skeletal muscle genes through direct interaction with MEF2A, a member of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family (2Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Bernardo N.G. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). dHAND is a bHLH protein expressed in deciduum, heart, autonomic nervous system and neural crest derivatives. Several laboratories cloned it in 1995 and gave it different names such as HAND2, Th2, and exd. The phenotype of dHAND null mice demonstrates the essential role of dHAND in the formation of the right ventricle, the trabeculae, and the neural crest-derived aortic arches. dHAND is also implicated in the regulation of chamber specification, cardiac looping, and cardiac neural crest (3Srivastava D. Thomas T. Olson E.N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Atria1 natriuretic peptide (ANP) is an important cardiac hormone expressed during heart development, and it regulates the blood volume and pressure. Reduced ANP expression in dHAND –/– mice suggests that dHAND is potentially important for the regulation of ANP. The ANP promoter harbors four functional E-box elements that might bind dHAND (4Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor that is required for cardiogenesis is myocyte enhancer binding factor 2C (MEF2C), which belongs to the MADS (MCM1, agamous, deficiens, and serum response factor) box family. In mammals, the MADS-box family is composed of four members, MEF2A, MEF2B, MEF2C, and MEF2D. These transcription factors contain an almost identical N-terminal region necessary to mediate DNA binding, and they are divergent in their C-terminal region, which is implicated in transcription activation. The MEF2 proteins can form homo- and heterodimers to bind the consensus DNA sequence (T/C)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A) to regulate gene expression. Inactivation of MEF2C in mouse leads to cardiac morphogenetic defects, vascular abnormalities, and embryonic lethality, which demonstrates an essential role of MEF2C in heart development (5Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of cardiac development requires the coordinated expression of several factors in a temporally and spatially defined manner. These cardiac-restricted transcription factors form multiprotein complexes around cardiac-restricted genes through interaction to regulate target genes. But the mechanism by which these genes regulate has yet to be determined. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional factors dHAND and MEF2C interact to synergistically activate expression of cardiac gene promoters in H9c2 cells. Inhibiting expression of dHAND and MEF2C in H9c2 cells result in down-regulation of ANP and α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC). Moreover, overexpression of dHAND and MEF2C in H9c2 cells result in up-regulation of ANP and α-MHC. In addition, the functional interaction on ANP promoter is mediated through the MEF2C-binding site but not dHAND-binding sites. This interaction suggests that dHAND protein was recruited by MEF2C to A/T sequence on ANP promoter to activate transcription. Plasmids—The pcDNA3-MEF2C expression vector was a gift of Dr. Coralie Poizat and Larry Kedes (University of Southern California). The pcDNA3-His2B-dHAND expression vector, the ANP reporter plasmid (–638 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site), and the α-MHC-luciferase (–330 base pairs upstream from the transcriptional start site) were gifts from Jeffery D. Molkentin and Dr. Yan-Shan Dai (Cincinnati, OH). RNAi Plasmids Construct—The U6/dHAND and U6/MEF2C RNAi constructs were designed following pSilencer neo™ Instruction Manual (Ambion). Briefly, 21-nucleotide-long inverted repeats separated by a 9-nucleotide linker were inserted downstream of the U6 promoter. Six thymidines were inserted downstream of the antisense strand to provide a stop signal for the RNA polymerase III. The sense strand of the hairpin was homologous to a 21-nucleotide region in the target mRNA (MEF2C or dHAND) and were analyzed by BLAST research to ensure that they did not have significant sequence homology with other genes. The sense strand of the MEF2C small interfering RNA (siRNA) was designed to be homologous to a region covering the MEF2C-coding sequence (nucleotides 538–558 bp) from the start codon of the mouse sequence (accession number L13171.1). The dHAND siRNA was designed to target a region near the C terminus of the dHAND-coding sequence (nucleotides 529–549 bp of the rat sequence NM_022696). Nucleotide overhangs to the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the DNA oligonucleotides, respectively. Sequences containing DNA templates for the synthesis of siRNAs are listed below. siRNA top strand of dHAND is 5′-GATCC AAA GAG GAG AAG AGG AAG AAA TTC AAG AGA TTT CTT CCT CTT CTC CTC TTT TTT TTTGGA AA-3′, and siRNA bottom strand of dHAND is 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA AAA GAG GAG AAG AGG AAG AAA TCT CTT GAA TTT CTT CCT CTT CTC CTC TTTG-3′. siRNA top strand of MEF2C is 5′-GATCC AAT AGT ATG TCT CCT GGT GTA TTC AAG AGA TAC ACC AGG AGA CAT ACT ATT TTT TTT GGA AA 3′, and siRNA bottom strand of MEF2C is 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAA AAT AGT ATG TCT CCT GGT GTA TCT CTT GAA TAC ACC AGG AGA CAT ACT ATTG-3′. These oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized and mixed in equimolar amounts, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, then gradually cooled to 37 °C for 1 h. The annealed siRNA templates were then ligated into pSilence2.1-U6 vector. pSilence2.1-U6 was purchased from Ambion. Transient Transfection Assays—H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, streptomycin (10 g/liter), and penicillin (10 g/liter). All transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in six-well plates. 24 h after plating, each well was transfected with 1.0 μg of reporter DNA ANP-Luc or α-MHC-Luc and 0.5 μg of expression vectors pcDNA3-MEF2C or/and pcDNA3-HisB-dHAND. β-Galactosidase (20 ng in each well) was used as an internal control. The total amount of DNA was kept constant using pcDNA3.1 empty vector. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection in a luminometer using FOLAR star reporter assay system (BMG) and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Each value presented is the average of triplicate samples and is representative of multiple independent experiments (n ≥ 3). The data were statistically analyzed with Student's t test. Northern Blot Analysis—After transfection with dHAND and MEF2C or RNAi plasmid of dHAND and MEF2C or empty vector pcDNA3 and pSilencer2.1-U6, total cellular RNA was isolated from H9c2 with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Twenty micrograms of total RNA were size-fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%), transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences) by capillary blotting in the presence of 20×SSC (300 mm sodium chloride and 300 mm sodium citrate), and then immobilized by incubating the membrane for 2 h at 80 °C. Blots were hybridized with random prime-labeled rat cDNA probes for ANP, α-MHC, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The hybridization signal obtained with the GAPDH probe was used to correct differences in loading and/or transfer efficiencies. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by a Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). The hybridization and washing were performed according to standard methods. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film for 24 h at –70 °C. The ANP probe was obtained by using the specific oligonucleotide primers 5′-AACCAGAGAGTGAGCCGAGACAGCAAA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGAGCAGATTTGGCTGTTATCTT-3′, which are based on the nucleotide sequence of rat ANP cDNA. The primers for α-MHC probe were 5′-TGGCGCCAAGCAGAAAATGCACGA-3′ and 5′-ACAGGCAAAGTCAAGCATTCATAT-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—H9c2 cells were lysed at 4 °C with a gentle rotation in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with anti-dHAND antibody by a gentle rotation. The immune complex (lysate proteins and antibody) was added to the spin cup containing the equilibrated immobilized protein A. Then it was incubated for at least 10 min, the tube was centrifuged, and 3 washes were done with binding/washing buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.008 m sodium phosphate, 0.002 m potassium phosphate, and 0.01 m KCl, pH 7.4). The immunoprecipitated protein was recovered using elution buffer and centrifugation. The eluted protein was mixed with sample buffer and loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Resolved proteins were transferred on Hybond-polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and Western blots were performed. The blot was incubated with MEF2C polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected with ECL chemiluminescence reagents (Santa Cruz) following the recommended protocol. The seize classic (A) immunoprecipitation kit was purchased from Pierce. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—H9c2 Cells were grown to 95% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were collected and crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min, then were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 × g. Cells were then resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitor) and sonicated 12 times for 10 s each followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and diluted in buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% SDS, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) followed by immunoclearing with 80 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with dHAND antibody or MEF2C antibody (Santa Cruz). After immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose was added, and the incubation was continues for another hour. Precipitates were washed sequentially in the following three different washing buffers for 5 min each; a low salt immune complex washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), a high salt immune complex washing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and a LiCl immune complex washing buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Precipitates were washed two times with Tris-EDTA buffer then used to PCR assay for their binding sequences. For PCR assays precipitates were extracted 3 times with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Elutions were pooled and heated at 65 °C for at least 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified; 1 μl from 50 μl of DNA extract was reserved for 25–30 cycles of PCR amplification. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The primers for the E-box were 5′-TCCACCCACGAGGCCAATGAAT-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGGATGTTTGCTGTCTCGGCTC-3′ (antisense primer). The primers for the A/T site were 5′-GACCTGTATCATGTTGGCTTCCTGG-3′ (sense primer) and 5′-ATTGGCCTCGTGGGTGGACCTCTGG-3′ (antisense primer). Synergistic Activation of the ANP and α-MHC Promoter by dHAND and MEF2C—Both dHAND and MEF2C regulate cardiac promoters and are expressed in cardiomyocytes. To gain great insight into the transcriptional mechanism regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression by dHAND and MEF2C, we investigated whether these two transcription factors could functionally interact to induce the activation of the ANP and α-MHC promoters. We employed H9c2 cells to address this issue. The H9c2 cell line is derived from 13.5-embryonic day BDIX rat heart tissue and was cloned by Kimes and Brandt in 1976 (6Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). ANP, α-MHC, dHAND, and MEF2C are all endogenously expressed in H9c2 cells. Cotransfection of both dHAND and MEF2C in H9c2 cells leads to a 7- and 5-fold increase in synergistic activation of the ANP and α-MHC promoter respectively (Fig. 1). These data suggest that the ANP and α-MHC genes are synergistically activated by co-expression of dHAND and MEF2C. Collectively, these results indicate that the transcription factors dHAND and MEF2C can functionally synergize to activate the promoters of the ANP and α-MHC gene. dHAND and MEF2C Synergistically Activate Expression of Endogenous ANP and α-MHC in H9c2 Cells—To further assess the function of dHAND and MEF2C in the activation ANP and α-MHC, we examined the effects of overexpression of dHAND and MEF2C on the expression of the endogenous ANP and α-MHC gene in H9c2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, expression of the cardiac-specific ANP gene was enhanced in H9c2 cells transfected with dHAND and MEF2C expression vector compared with H9c2 cells transfected with the empty vector pcDNA3.1. Furthermore, when repressing dHAND and MEF2C expression by transfecting the H9c2 cells with RNAi plasmid of dHAND and MEF2C, the expression of the ANP gene was reduced compared with the transfection of H9c2 cells with pSilencer2.1-U6 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained for the α-MHC gene (Fig. 2A). Importantly, endogenous expression of dHAND and MEF2C was dramatically reduced in H9c2 cells transfected with the RNAi plasmid of dHAND and MEF2C, respectively (Fig. 2B). Moreover, both expression of dHAND and MEF2C were increased in transfected H9c2 cells with dHAND and MEF2C. These findings suggest that dHAND and MEF2C maintain transcription of ANP and α-MHC gene. dHAND and MEF2C Physically Interact in Vivo—Our previous studies indicate that dHAND directly interacts with full-length MEF2C in vitro (7Zang M-X. Li Y. Xue L.-X. Jia H.-T. Jing H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To examine whether dHAND and MEF2C interact in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in H9c2 cells. Protein lysates from H9c2 cells were first incubated with dHAND antibody, then protein A was used to precipitate dHAND from protein lysates, which was resolved in a SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot with anti-MEF2C antibody. The data demonstrated that MEF2C interacted with dHAND in vivo but not with preimmune goat serum (Fig. 3). These data suggest that MEF2C and dHAND physically interact in vivo to form a protein complex. dHAND·MEF2C Protein Complex Bind to the A/T Sequence of ANP Promoter in H9c2 Cells Treated with Phenylephrine (PE)—Our previous studies show that the dHAND·MEF2C protein complex binds to the A/T sequence of ANP promoter in unstimulated H9c2 cells (7Zang M-X. Li Y. Xue L.-X. Jia H.-T. Jing H. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 93: 1255-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which also suggests that in the H9c2 cell line the interaction of dHAND and MEF2C takes place in the A/T sequence of ANP promoter. To further address whether the dHAND and MEF2C complex change their binding sites on ANP promoter under PE stimulation, a serial of ChIP experiments was performed in H9c2 cells treated with PE. PE is a well known stimulator of cell enlargement (hypertrophy) in rat ventricular myocytes. This hypertrophic response induces the expression of ANP (8Mcdonough P.M. Brown J.H. Glembotski C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H625-H630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine whether dHAND·MEF2C protein complexes are assembled on one or both sites of ANP promoter, we divided the soluble chromatin into two aliquots; one was immunoprecipitated with dHAND antibodies and the other with MEF2C antibodies. Both of the eluted immunoprecipitates were amplified by the two site sequences of the ANP promoter (Fig. 4). The data demonstrate that both dHAND and MEF2C can occupy the DNA fragment from –628 to –494 bp, which harbors the A/T sequence (Fig. 4A), whereas they do not assemble on the DNA fragment from –511 to +62 bp, which harbors the E-box sequence (Fig. 4B). All these results demonstrate that the dHAND·MEF2C protein complex still binds to the A/T sequence of ANP promoter in H9c2 cells treated with PE. In this study we have obtained the following results. 1) dHAND and MEF2C interact to synergistically activate transcription of ANP and α-MHC in H9c2 cells, 2) ANP and α-MHC mRNA levels are reduced when inhibiting the expression of dHAND and MEF2C, and 3) dHAND·MEF2C synergy is dependent on MEF2C DNA binding, and dHAND protein is recruited by MEF2C to the A/T sequence on the ANP promoter to activate ANP transcription. Roles of MEF2C and dHAND in Regulating Heart Development—MEF2C is a member of the MEF2 transcriptional factors family that contains MADS and MEF2 domains to mediate DNA binding and dimerization. These MEF2 transcriptional factors have been shown to be expressed at high level in all muscle cells, but they are also found in brain and lymphoid tissue (9Black B.L. Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). They are important regulators of muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation of all three muscle lineages. For example, during myogenesis, MEF2A and muscle bHLH proteins cooperatively activate skeletal muscle genes. Thus, skeletal myogenesis is mediated by MEF2A, which can initiate the developmental cascade. In fact, the MEF2 family directly associates with cell-specific transcriptional factors to regulate the determination, proliferation, and differentiation of cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and neural cells. They control the development of multiple tissues including heart, vasculature, neural tubes, and skeletal muscle (2Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Bernardo N.G. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). MEF2C is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, spleen, and brain. In the developing mouse heart, MEF2C is initially expressed in the precardiogenic mesoderm beginning at embryonic day 7.75 (E 7.75). Consistent with its expression pattern, inactivation of the MEF2C gene in mice leads to cardiac morphogenetic defects, vascular abnormalities, and lethality by E 9.5, suggesting that MEF2C functions as a critical regulator of cardiac development. Indeed, MEF2C plays a critical role in the looping of the cardiac tube, development of the right ventricle, and expression of a subset of cardiac muscle genes (10Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N. Science. 1997; 276: 1404-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The direct transcriptional targets of MEF2C in regulation of diverse cell fates are largely unknown. Four members of the MEF2 transcriptional factor family bind to a DNA sequence element, referred to as an A/T-rich sequence, which consists of the consensus DNA sequence (T/C)TA(A/T)4TA(G/A). MEF2C forms homodimers and heterodimers that interact with the A/T-rich sequence element to directly promote transcriptional activation of the target gene. Here we demonstrated that MEF2C functions in concert with dHAND as a mechanism of enhancing cardiac-specific ANP and α-MHC gene transcription. This synergy between MEF2C and dHAND was independent of the ability of dHAND to bind the E-box on ANP promoter, and it required the dHAND·MEF2C protein complex to bind the A/T-rich sequence element on the ANP promoter. These observations suggest that MEF2C can participate in programming the cardiac gene expression through combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors such as dHAND. These results also indicate that dHAND can function in regulating ANP gene expression independently of the E-box sequence elements. Like MEF2C, dHAND is also thought to function in regulating cell type-specific gene expression through combinatorial interactions with other transcriptional factors. dHAND is a member of a large transcription factors family that contains the bHLH domain which mediates DNA binding and dimerization. These transcription factors are expressed in a wide array of eukaryotic organisms from yeast to humans. For example, dHAND is expressed in numerous tissues including the heart, limbs, and multiple neural crest-derivatized tissues during development. Most notably, dHAND forms both homodimers with itself and heterodimers with the ubiquitously expressed E12/E47 bHLH proteins or with non-bHLH proteins to enhance transcriptional activation (4Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24390-24398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated that dHAND was recruited by MEF2C to potentiate cardiac-specific ANP gene expression. dHAND has also been reported to interact with transcriptional factors NKX2.5 and GATA4, which together are co-expressed only in the myocardium. All these combinatorial interactions result in synergistic activation of the ANP promoter. We also did RNAi and Northern blot analysis to address the roles of dHAND and MEF2C on transcriptional activation of ANP and α-MHC. RNAi is the process of gene-silencing whereby siRNAs hybridize to their cognate mRNA to induce the specific degradation of the target mRNA (13Gaudillière B. Shi Y. Bonni A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46442-46446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). U6 promoter-driven RNAi vectors of dHAND and MEF2C were used to induce hairpin RNA-triggered RNAi and characterize the role of the two transcription factors in H9c2 cells. We found that expression of dHAND and MEF2C hairpin RNA leads to the efficient inhibition of endogenous dHAND and MEF2C protein expression in H9c2 cells. Meanwhile, ANP and α-MHC mRNA levels were down-regulated when suppressing the expression of dHAND and MEF2C. Accordingly, our data reveal that dHAND and MEF2C play critical roles in regulating the activity of ANP and α-MHC promoters. Mechanism for MEF2C and dHAND Transcriptional Regulation of ANP—ANP and MHC play important roles during heart development. For example, ANP is a cardiac peptide hormone that possesses significant diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilatory activities and plays a critical role in the maintenance of blood pressure and sodium balance. During embryonic development, the ANP gene is expressed in both the atrium and the ventricle, but after birth, the expression of ANP is mainly in the cardiac atria. However, if the ventricle is subjected to diverse stimuli causing ventricular hypertrophy, including growth factors, cytokines such as phenylephrine or angiotensin II, mechanical stretch, and activators of protein kinase C, the ventricular ANP gene is stimulated and starts to be expressed. ANP, once released into the circulation, cause natriuresis, diuresis, and vasodilation. Thus, ANP plays a potentially important role in hemodynamic regulation during hypertension. Because expression of ANP is abundant in ventricular cells during embryogenesis and subsequently is extinguished during normal adult development, the reexpression of ANP within hypertrophied ventricular myocytes has been considered to be representative of the induction of an embryonic gene program (14Knowlton K.U. Baracchinit E. Ross R.S. Harris A.N. Hendersonll S.A. Evans S.M. Glembotski C.C. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7759-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-MHC, another cardiac-specific gene, encodes a gene for a cardiac contractile protein and plays an important role in the speed of heart contraction because it has a characteristic adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, which is correlated with the energy transduction responsible for the generation of force in muscle. The myosin heavy chains are encoded by a highly conserved multigene family, and their expression is tissue- and developmental stage-specific. In cardiac muscle, two distinct MHC genes, α- and β-MHC isoforms, have been characterized. Both cardiac MHC genes are coexpressed in the early heart tube when septation and the cardiac compartments form; the α-MHC gene is expressed only in the atria, whereas β-MHC expression is restricted to the ventricles. At birth or in the adult the α-MHC mRNA becomes the predominant MHC transcript in the ventricle (15Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Werte S. Neumannli J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although ANP and α-MHC play important roles during heart development, little is understood in the mechanisms of regulation in cardiomyocytes. Delineation of the ANP and α-MHC regulatory elements has further yielded insight into the transcriptional regulation of a cardiac-specific gene. ANP promoter harbors four copies of the E-box sites and an A/T-rich sequence. α-MHC promoter harbors two copies of the E-box sites and an A/T-rich sequence. Interactions between these cis-elements and cardiac-specific transcriptional factors finetune transcription of ANP and α-MHC genes. Here we demonstrated that dHAND interacts with MEF2C to potentiate cardiac-specific expression of ANP and α-MHC. Most notably, dHAND protein was recruited by MEF2C to an A/T sequence on the ANP promoter to activate ANP transcription in H9c2 cells treated with PE. Consistent with our results, Thattaliyath et al. (4Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that dHAND functions as a transcriptional activator partially independent on DNA binding. Indeed, interaction between transcription factors may take place at one of their binding sites. For example, among these cardiac-specific transcription factors, GATA4 recruits MEF2C (5Morin S. Charron F. Robitaille L. Nemer M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2046-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), NKX2.5 recruits dHAND (4Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and NKX2.5 recruits GATA4 (15Subramaniam A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Werte S. Neumannli J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24613-24620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these recruitments lead to an increase of ANP promoter activity. On the other hand, interaction between transcription factors may take place at both of their binding sites. For example, the synergistic activation of cardiac promoters by NKX2.5-TBX5 interaction has been shown to be based on stable ternary complexes composed of NKX2.5-TBX5 interaction as well as the simultaneous binding of each protein to its binding site (17Bruneau B.G. Nemer G. Schmitt J.P. Charron F. Robitaille L. Caron S. Conner D. Gessler M. Nemer M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

Accordingly, our results provide a molecular paradigm for elucidating the regulation mechanisms of dHAND and MEF2C on heart development. During cardiogenesis and cardiac differentiation, many transcription factors play important roles on ANP transcription. For example, dHAND interacts with MEF2C, GATA4, or NKX2.5 (4Thattaliyath B.D. Firulli B.A. Firulli A.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Dai Y.S. Cserjesi P. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All these interactions contribute to enhance the activity of ANP promoter. These transcription factors and their target genes generate a unique network of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions to form a cardiac-specific enhanceosome, which coordinates expression of target gene. The enhanceosome is made of stable multiprotein complexes that promote the cooperative recruitment of coactivators and RNA polymerase II complex to activate transcription. Assembly of the enhanceosome is regulated by specific extracellular events and intracellular signals (19Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1287-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vo N. Goodman R.H. J. Biol.

Although we have shown that MEF2C forms a complex with dHAND, it is not clear how complex formation is regulated. A challenge for future investigations is to discover the temporal and spatial regulation of these interactions during heart development. It is reported that p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) activates MEF2 in cardiac muscle (23Finn S.G. Dickens M. Fuller S.J. Biochem.

Development. 1998; 125: 3005-3014PubMed Google Scholar), so the analysis of interaction between dHAND and MEF2C in response to different stimuli in cardiomyocytes at various development stages will be important to understand the mechanisms of enhanceosome formation on ANP and α-MHC transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2005403372,"The Na,K-ATPase is a transmembrane protein responsible for maintaining electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane in all mammalian cells, a process that is subject to regulation at the transcriptional as well as post-transcriptional level. Included among physiologic regulators in the kidney are prostaglandins. Previously, we demonstrated that prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) increases the activity and expression of the Na,K-ATPase in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (Taub, M., Borsick, M., Geisel, J., Matlhagela, K., Rajkhowa, T., and Allen, C.

In this work, we present evidence that transcription of the Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit is stimulated by PGE1, an effect that may be mediated through the cAMP and Ca2+ pathways. Transient transfection studies using 5′-deletion mutants of the human β1 subunit promoter indicated that region -100 to -92 containing the sequence AGTCCCTGC (a prostaglandin-responsive element (PGRE)) is required to elicit the stimulatory effects of PGE1, 8-bromo-cAMP, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and okadaic acid. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that both the cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) and Sp1 bind to the PGRE present within this region of the β1 subunit promoter. The involvement of the PGRE and Sp1 sites in regulation by PGE1 was further confirmed by the increased PGE1 stimulation that was observed following insertion of the PGRE into a promoter/luciferase construct containing a portion of a heterologous promoter and the fibronectin promoter with four GC boxes. Further evidence suggesting an interaction between Sp1 and CREB was obtained from experiments conducted with pLuc-MCS-β72–167, which contains region -167 to -72 in the human β1 subunit promoter. The PGE1 stimulation observed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells transiently transfected with pLuc-MCS-β72–167 was reduced when the two GC boxes immediately upstream from the PGRE were translocated farther upstream. Also consistent with an interaction between CREB and Sp1 are the results of our immunoprecipitation studies indicating that CREB co-immunoprecipitated with Sp1 when an antibody against CREB, Sp1, or the CREB-binding protein was used.

The Na,K-ATPase is a ubiquitous transmembrane protein that establishes and maintains an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane in virtually all mammalian cells (3Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). In addition, the Na,K-ATPase plays specialized roles in specific cell types. For example, in nerve and muscle cells, the Na,K-ATPase is involved in the propagation of an action potential. In the kidney, where the Na,K-ATPase is present at higher levels than in most tissues, the Na,K-ATPase plays an important role in Na+ reabsorption, a process that occurs in tubular epithelial cells. In kidney tubule epithelial cells, the Na,K-ATPase is present in the basolateral membrane, promoting transepithelial ion transport (4Cereijido M. Robbins E.S. Dolan W.J. Rotunno C.A. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 853-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Na+ in the lumen of the nephron is transported into the tubule epithelial cells through transport systems localized to the apical membrane, including the Na+/H+ antiport system. Intracellular Na+ is then transported out of the cells' basolateral membrane through the Na,K-ATPase in exchange for extracellular K+, a process that utilizes ATP. The α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (a 112-kDa protein) mediates the catalytic activity, whereas the glycosylated β subunit (40–60 kDa) has been proposed to facilitate the assembly and transport of the α subunit from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. The Na,K-ATPase is subject to regulation by a number of effector molecules, including peptide hormones such as triiodothyronine (T3) 1The abbreviations used are: T3, triiodothyronine; PKC, protein kinase C; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PGRE, prostaglandin response element; SPGRE, Sp1-containing PGRE; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREM, CRE modulator; CREB, cAMP regulatory element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; FN, fibronectin; MRE/GRE, mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid-responsive element; TRE, thyroid hormone-responsive element; CaM kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor. 1The abbreviations used are: T3, triiodothyronine; PKC, protein kinase C; PGE1, prostaglandin E1; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PGRE, prostaglandin response element; SPGRE, Sp1-containing PGRE; 8-Br-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; CRE, cAMP-responsive element; CREM, CRE modulator; CREB, cAMP regulatory element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; FN, fibronectin; MRE/GRE, mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid-responsive element; TRE, thyroid hormone-responsive element; CaM kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase; ATF, activating transcription factor. and steroid hormones such as hydrocortisone. These effector molecules may have acute effects on the activity of pre-existing Na,K-ATPases (5Scherzer P. Wald H. Rubinger D. Popovtzer M.M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 83: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as well as chronic effects resulting from changes in the number of Na,K-ATPases present intracellularly (2Taub M.L. Wang Y. Yang I.S. Fiorella P. Lee S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Such chronic effects may be the consequence of transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional events. When considering the effects of any one of a number of regulatory molecules, their effects on the Na,K-ATPase are difficult to predict, as exemplified by the case of T3. In fetal rat brain, T3 affects gene expression largely at the post-transcriptional level (6Corthesy-Theulaz I. Māerillat A.M. Honegger P. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C124-C131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in rat kidney cortex, T3 also affects Na,K-ATPase α1 and β1 subunit gene expression at the transcriptional level (7Gick G.G. Ismail-Beigi F. Edelman I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16610-16618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which other regulatory factors control Na,K-ATPase activity are often not similarly well defined. Prostaglandins are included among the regulatory factors that regulate the activity of the Na,K-ATPase (5Scherzer P. Wald H. Rubinger D. Popovtzer M.M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 83: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 8Breyer M.D. Zhang Y. Guan Y.F. Hao C.M. Hebert R.L. Breyer R.M. Kidney Int.

Prostaglandins initiate their regulatory effects on transport systems such as the Na,K-ATPase through their interaction with G-protein-coupled prostanoid receptors. Subsequently, such signaling pathways as the cAMP and protein kinase C (PKC) pathways may be activated depending upon the prostanoid receptor that is involved. This study is concerned with defining the transcriptional regulation of the Na,K-ATPase by one such prostaglandin, PGE1, using a well characterized in vitro model system of the renal distal tubule, the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line (11Saier Jr., M.H. Boerner P. Grenier F.C. McRoberts J.A. Rindler M.J. Taub M. Ü H.S. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1986; 12: 42-50PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we observed that PGE1 stimulates the activity of the Na,K-ATPase in MDCK cells, an effect that could be explained by increased expression of the mRNAs for the α and β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase (1Taub M. Borsick M. Geisel J. Matlhagela K. Rajkhowa T. Allen C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 2Taub M.L. Wang Y. Yang I.S. Fiorella P. Lee S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have also obtained evidence of a stimulatory effect of PGE1 on β1 subunit transcription while using a human Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter/luciferase construct (pHβ1-1141Luc (12Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). In this work, we define a prostaglandin-responsive element (PGRE) that is present in the human Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit promoter. The results of our transient transfection studies with 5′-deletion mutants of the β1 subunit promoter indicate the presence of a functional PGRE with the sequence AGTCCCTGC at a position located within region -182 to -83. The observed 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) stimulation, the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation, and the okadaic acid stimulation, like the PGE1 stimulation, were all dependent upon the presence of the same functional element in the β1 subunit promoter, suggesting that this element is a cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the presence of a sequence located between -111 and -81 that binds to the cAMP regulatory element-binding protein (CREB) and Sp1 transcription factors. To determine further the nature of the involvement of CREB and Sp1 in mediating PGE1 stimulation, the PGRE was introduced into a heterologous promoter, and studies were conducted with pLuc-MCS containing either a normal or a mutant region of the β1 subunit promoter. In addition, evidence for an interaction between CREB and Sp1 was obtained from immunoprecipitation and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down studies. The results of these studies suggest that a novel interaction between these transcription factors is involved in mediating regulation initiated by effector molecules acting through both cAMP- and Ca2+-mediated pathways.

The expression vector pLuc-MCS (which contains a minimal promoter with a TATA sequence), the pFR-Luc reporter plasmid, the fusion transactivator plasmid pFA2-CREB, and the negative control plasmid pFC2-dbd were all obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The pFR-Luc reporter plasmid contains a promoter with five tandem repeats of the yeast Gal4-binding site that control expression of the luciferase gene. The pFA2-CREB plasmid encodes a protein that contains the activation domain of CREB and the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain (residues 1–147). When the transcriptional activator CREB is phosphorylated and activated, the fusion protein binds to the Gal4-binding sites on the pFR-Luc reporter plasmid and activates transcription of the luciferase gene. Cell Culture and Transfection—The basal medium consists of a 50:50 mixture of DMEM and Ham's nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm sodium bicarbonate, penicillin, and streptomycin as described previously (17Taub M. Chuman L. Saier Jr., M.H. Sato G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The growth medium for stock cultures of MDCK cells (Medium K-1) was further supplemented with 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 5 μg/ml human transferrin, 5 × 10-12m T3, 5 × 10-8m hydrocortisone, 25 ng/ml PGE1, and 5 × 10-8m selenium. MDCK stock cultures were subcultured using 0.53 mm EDTA and 0.05% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by inhibition of trypsin action with soybean trypsin inhibitor as described previously (17Taub M. Chuman L. Saier Jr., M.H. Sato G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). MDCK cells to be utilized for transient transfection studies were plated at 2 × 105 cells/35-mm dish into dishes containing DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin. The day after plating, the cultures were cotransfected with the appropriate reporter plasmid (1 μg) as well as with the pSVβgal plasmid (0.2 μg) so as to adjust for transfection efficiency. For each condition, transfections were carried out in quadruplicate in antibioticfree medium supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin utilizing Lipofectamine. The next day, the medium was changed to antibiotic-containing medium (DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin), and the cultures were returned to a 5% CO2 and 95% air humidified environment. Two hours later, appropriate effector molecules were added to the cultures, and the cultures were then allowed to incubate for 4 h (unless indicated otherwise). At the end of the incubation, the monolayers were solubilized in reporter lysis buffer. After the cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, the lysates were either immediately utilized for assays of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities or stored at -20 °C until used. To measure luciferase activity, an aliquot of the cell lysate was placed in 20 μl of luciferase assay buffer containing 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm MgCO3·4Mg(OH)2, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 270 μm CoA, 470 μm luciferin, and 530 μm ATP. The light units emitted were determined using a Packard Tri-Carb 4530 scintillation counter with the coincidence circuit turned off. To determine the β-galactosidase activity of the transfected cells, aliquots of cell extracts were incubated at 23 °C in reaction buffer containing the Galacton-Star® substrate (provided in the Galacto-Star™ system), and the light emitted was then measured as described above. β-Galactosidase activity is expressed as a fraction of the activity in control transfected cultures. Each determination of luciferase activity was normalized with respect to the β-galactosidase activity of the culture. The normalized luciferase value obtained in each condition was the mean ± S.E. of quadruplicate determinations. The percent normalized value was compared with the indicated control value from the same experimental culture set. The significance of each observed stimulatory (or inhibitory) effect was determined by one-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test (using programs in Prism 4 software). Differences were determined as being significant when p < 0.05. Plasmid Construction—Previously, the human Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit gene promoter was inserted into the pOLuc plasmid (to obtain the construct pHβ1-1141Luc) (12Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A set of deletion mutants within the human Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit promoter (pHβ1-726Luc, pHβ1-554Luc, pHβ1-456Luc, pHβ1-327Luc, and pHβ1-83Luc) was constructed as described previously by Feng et al. (12Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we prepared additional deletion mutants (pHβ1-212Luc, pHβ1-232Luc, and pHβ1-182Luc) by exonuclease III digestion of pHβ1-554Luc following cleavage of pHβ1-554Luc at the unique SalI and SdaI restriction sites, located immediately 5′ relative to the β1 subunit promoter region. A double-stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide with a sequence homologous to -167 to -72 of the human Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter, AGCTTCCA AGCGGCCCCT CTAGCCCCGGCGGCTCCTTT GTGCCGGCCC CGAACCCGCCCTCTCGGGCC GAGTCCCTGC CCCTGGCGCC GGCGATTGGC (with the GC boxes underlined and the PGRE boldface and underlined), was ligated into the HindIII/XhoI sites on the polylinker of the pLuc-MCS plasmid upstream from the TATA box, creating the expression vector pLuc-MCS-β72–167. In addition, a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide in which the two GC boxes were translocated as indicated, AGCTT GGCGGCCCGCCC CCA AGCGGCCCCT CTAGCCCC CTCCTTT GTGCCGGCCC CGAA TCTCGGGCC GAGTCCCTGC CCCTGGCGCC GGCGATTGGC, was also ligated into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pLuc-MCS, creating the expression vector pLuc-MCS-β72–167-2GCtrans. A double-stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide with a sequence homologous to -118 to -36 of the human fibronectin (FN) promoter (19Suzuki M. Oda E. Nakajima T. Sekiya S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3010-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), AGCTTGGCGGGCGGGTGGGGTGGGGCGGGGCGG GGACAGCCCG GCGGGTCTCT CCTCCCCCGCGCCCCGGGCC TCCAGAGGGGCGGGC (with four GC boxes underlined), was inserted into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pLuc-MCS, creating the expression vector pLuc-MCS-FN. The double-stranded synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide with the sequence from -118 to -36 with the PGRE inserted downstream from -84, AGCTTGGCGGGCGGGTGGGGTGGGGCGGGGCGG GGACAGC CGAGTCCCTGC CCG GCGGGTCTCT CCTCCCCCGCGCCCCGGGCC TCCAGAGGGGCGGGC, was also inserted into the HindIII/XhoI sites of pLuc-MCS, creating pLuc-MCS-PGREFN. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from MDCK cells by a modification (21Andrews N.C. Faller D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) of the procedure of Dignam et al. (20Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). To summarize, MDCK cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml bovine insulin and 5 μg/ml human transferrin. The monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the dishes using a rubber policeman, transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 s at 4 °C. After removing the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C in a volume that was 2-fold greater than the packed cell volume. After swelling on ice for 10 min, the cells were vortexed for 20 s and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 s (also at 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). After incubation on ice for 20 min, the suspension was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided into aliquots and quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentration of the aliquots was determined by the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215458) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The custom-synthesized double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were 32P-labeled by the random priming method using [α-32P]dCTP. The consensus CRE oligonucleotide, the mutant CRE oligonucleotide, and the consensus Sp1 site were 32P-5′-end-labeled when used as probes. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were also used as competitors. Included among the oligonucleotides used were the PGRE (CTCTCGGGCCGAGTCCCTGCCCCTGGCGCCG, -81 to -111), 2) the synthetic PGRE (SPGRE) (GCCCCGAACCCGCCCTCTCGGGCCGAGTCCCTGCCCCTGGCGCC, -82 to -125), 3) the consensus CRE (AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG), 4) a mutant CRE (AGAGATTGCCTGTGGTCAGAGAGCTAG), and 5) the consensus Sp1 oligonucleotide (ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC). During the DNA binding reactions, nuclear extracts (2–6 μg) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) in a volume of 9 μl. An excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide (50–200-fold) was used in competition reactions. The 32P-labeled probe was added to the reaction tube, and the incubation was continued for 20 min at 37 °C. In studies using antibodies, the antibody was added either during the initial incubation period with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe or after this initial incubation period as specified. The binding reaction was terminated by the addition of gel loading buffer (to a final concentration of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 4% glycerol), and samples from the binding reactions were immediately separated on nondenaturing 4% acrylamide and 0.001% bisacrylamide gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. To compare the intensities of particular bands on autoradiograms, the bands on the autoradiograms were scanned with a Bio-Rad scanning densitometer and quantified using the Quantity One program. Immunoprecipitations and GST Pull-down Assays—MDCK cell cultures utilized for immunoprecipitations and GST pull-down assays were cultured in 100-mm diameter dishes in serum-free DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin. The cultures were transiently transfected with 1 μg of the Rc/RSV-CREB vector and 1 μg of the pcDNA3-Sp1 vector. After 18 h, the cultures were treated for 4 h with 500 ng/ml PGE1. Subsequently, the cultures were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF; removed from the culture dishes with a rubber policeman; and spun in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Immunoprecipitations were conducted by a modification of the method described by Taub et al. (1Taub M. Borsick M. Geisel J. Matlhagela K. Rajkhowa T. Allen C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To summarize, aliquots of cell extracts, equalized with respect to protein, were pre-absorbed with preimmune serum coupled to protein G-Sepharose in lysis buffer and then mixed by rotation with rabbit anti-CREB or rabbit anti-Sp1 antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads in lysis buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 3,000 rpm using lysis buffer and heated in electrophoresis sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min, followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Full-length GST-CREM and GST alone were produced in host bacteria (23Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). The GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating cell lysates (prepared as described above) in lysis buffer using equivalent quantities of either GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After mixing by rotation for 16 h at 4 °C, bound proteins were washed by centrifugation in lysis buffer and eluted by heating in SDS sample buffer at 100 °C for 3 min. The samples obtained from immunoprecipitations and GST pull-down assays were separated by SDS-PAGE using either 12% gels (CREB) or 7.5% gels (Sp1). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with either anti-Sp1 or anti-CREB antibody, and bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Effect of PGE1 and 8-Br-cAMP—To study the regulation of the human Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter activity by PGE1 and 8-Br-cAMP, MDCK cells were transiently transfected with pHβ1-1141Luc, a human Na,K-ATPase β1 promoter/luciferase construct (12Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cultures were incubated for 4 h in the presence of 500 ng/ml PGE1, 1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, or no further supplement (control). Fig. 1 shows that PGE1 caused a 4.8 ± 0.3-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the control, whereas 8-Br-cAMP caused a 4.4 ± 0.4-fold increase. Previously, both a mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid-responsive element (MRE/GRE; -572 to -552) (24Derfoul A. Robertson N.M. Lingrel J.B. Hall D.J. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and a thyroid hormone-responsive element (TRE; -459 to -438) (12Feng J. Orlowski J. Lingrel J.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were identified on the human Na,K-ATPase β1 subunit promoter (Fig. 2A). To determine whether either of these elements is required for PGE1 or 8-Br-cAMP stimulation, transient transfection studies were conducted with the 5′-deletion constructs shown in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2 (B and C) indicates that the stimulatory effects of PGE1 and 8-Br-cAMP were retained in deletion constructs lacking the MRE/GRE (located at -572 to -552; as exemplified by the deletion mutant pHβ1-554Luc) and/or the TRE (located at -459 to -438; as exemplified by the deletion mutant pHβ1-327Luc). Stimulation by PGE1 and 8-Br-cAMP was even retained in the deletion mutant pHβ1-182Luc. However, in the deletion mutant pHβ1-83Luc, activation of luciferase activity by PGE1 and 8-Br-cAMP was lost completely. These results suggest that a regulatory element(s) located between -182 and -83 is required to"
https://openalex.org/W1987622138,"The plasmid R6K is an interesting model system for investigating initiation of DNA replication, not only near the primary binding sites of the initiator protein π but also at a distance, caused by π -mediated DNA looping. An important milestone in the mechanistic analysis of this replicon was the development of a reconstituted replication system consisting of 22 different highly purified proteins (Abhyankar, M. A., Zzaman, S., and Bastia, D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 45476–45484). Although the in vitro reconstituted system promotes ori γ-specific initiation of replication by a mutant form of the initiator called π *, the wild type (WT) π is functionally inert in this system. Here we show that the chaperone DnaK along with its co-chaperone DnaJ and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE were needed to activate WT π and caused it to initiate replication in vitro at the correct origin. We show further that the reaction was relatively chaperone-specific and that other chaperones, such as ClpB and ClpX, were incapable of activating WT π. The molecular mechanism of activation appeared to be a chaperone-catalyzed facilitation of dimeric inert WT π into iteron-bound monomers. Protein-protein interaction analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that, in the absence of ATP, DnaJ directly interacted with π but its binary interactions with DnaK and GrpE and with ClpB and ClpX were at background levels, suggesting that π is recruited by protein-protein interaction with DnaJ and then fed into the DnaK chaperone machine to promote initiator activation.

The plasmid R6K contains three origins of DNA replication called α, β, and γ and two sequence-specific terminators (Ter sites) (1Crosa J.H. Luttrop L.K. Falkow S. J.

The plasmid requires both the plasmid-encoded initiator protein π and the host-encoded DnaA for replication initiation from the replication origins γ and α, whereas initiation from ori β requires π but can occur without DnaA (10Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kelley W.L. Patel I. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 32: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Germino J. Bastia D. Cell. 1983; 34: 125-134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) promotes DNA looping and binding to a single iteron at α and to the half-iteron at ori β (see Fig. 1A) (15Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D. Cell. 1988; 52: 375-383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Mukherjee S. Erickson H. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6287-6291Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus the seven iterons are not only needed for initiation from γ but also from the distant α and β origins (2Crosa J.H. Luttrop L. Falkow S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 124: 443-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 17Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The single iteron at α and the half-iteron at β are essential for initiation from those two origins, respectively (10Kelley W.L. Bastia D. New Biol. 1992; 4: 569-580PubMed Google Scholar, 17Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In vitro data are consistent with the notion that α-γ or β-γ looping not only activates α and β, respectively, but looping also keeps ori γ repressed (17Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus R6K not only provides an opportunity to investigate the details of the mechanism of local and distant origin activation by looping but also the details of origin repression. To dissect the biochemical steps of replication initiation locally and at a distance and of ori repression, we have developed a reconstituted in vitro replication system consisting of 22 purified proteins (18Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the in vitro system, a mutant form of the monomeric initiator called π * (P42L/P106L/F107S), but not the usually dimeric wild type π, is active in replication initiation. Although the monomeric form of π promotes initiation from γ, it is unable to activate the distant α and β origins because of its inability to loop DNA (17Miron A. Mukherjee S. Bastia D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1205-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Bullesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, it stands to reason that both the monomeric and the oligomeric forms of π are probably involved in the activation of the distant origins, whereas monomeric initiator is sufficient for initiation at γ (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, it is reasonable to expect that there should be a mechanism in the cell to maintain the requisite equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric π so that the copy number is maintained and conditions are created that facilitate DNA looping and activation of replication from the two major origins (α and β) (see Fig. 1B). Which additional proteins might be needed to activate the inert dimeric π ? A reasonable possibility is suggested by the known roles of chaperones in the replication of other plasmid and phage chromosomes and from the consideration that monomeric π is active in the initiation of ori γ in vitro, whereas dimeric π is inert (19Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Bullesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Chaperones, originally discovered as heat shock proteins, are normally present in the cell at lower concentrations, but their synthesis is enhanced in response to a thermal shock. The Hsp70 class of heat shock proteins, to which DnaK belongs, are known to be involved in ATP-dependent protein disaggregation, unfolding for transport through the membrane, and activation of already folded proteins by promoting monomerization of the dimeric proteins (20Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The DnaK chaperone works in conjunction with the DnaJ co-chaperone and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE to promote phage λ replication by dissociating the DnaB helicase from the phage-encoded P protein (21Mensa-Wilmot K.

The DnaK chaperone system is also known to be required for the activation of the wild type RepA initiator protein of plasmids P1 and F (26Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 28Kawasaki Y. Wada C. Yura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11520-11524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, replication of plasmid RK2 requires the ClpX chaperone (29Konieczny I. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14378-14382Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DnaK (Hsp70) chaperone system consists of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE proteins. DnaK contains 638 amino acids and has a N-terminal ATPase domain followed by a linker domain that in turn is followed by a substrate-binding domain and finally a C-terminal domain of unknown function. The ATP-bound DnaK chaperone has low affinity for its substrate and is converted to the ADP-bound high affinity form by interaction with the DnaJ co-chaperone that induces hydrolysis of the ATP bound to DnaK (20Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The DnaJ protein (376 amino acids) consists of an N-terminal J domain followed by a G/F motif, a linker domain, and a Zn2+ finger domain followed in turn by the C-terminal substrate-binding domain. DnaJ can act by itself as a chaperone (20Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). The GrpE protein (197 amino acids) binds to DnaK and acts as a nucleotide exchange factor that promotes the conversion of the ADP form of DnaK to the ATP form (30Zylicz M. Ang D. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of an N-terminal domain of unknown function followed by an α-helical dimerization domain followed in turn by a C-terminal β-sheet domain. The last two domains are needed for binding to DnaK (20Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). ClpA and ClpX, the ClpY family of proteins, are ATP-dependent proteases that have two components: 1) a chaperone component (such as ClpA and ClpX) and 2) a protease component (called ClpP and ClpQ) with which the chaperone component transiently associates and causes unfolding and degradation of damaged proteins (27Wickner S.

Although the involvement of chaperones in plasmid replication is well documented, no information (either in vivo or in vitro) was available as to the identity of the chaperone system that might be needed to activate R6K-encoded π protein. Moreover, with the exception of phage λ replication (21Mensa-Wilmot K. Seaby R. Alfano C. Wold M.C. Gomes B. Mc-Macken R. J. Biol.

Keeping the above-mentioned questions in mind, we proceeded to purify several chaperones from the host Escherichia coli and tested their ability to (i) enhance the binding of WT π to iteron DNA and (ii) enable the initiator to activate replication origins in the reconstituted system. In this paper, we reported on the development of such a system that includes the chaperone DnaK, the co-chaperone DnaJ, and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (38Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N.

The results showed that the DnaK chaperone system activated WT π initiator by promoting a dimer to monomeric conversion of π upon binding to iteron DNA. We also found that the activation was relatively chaperone-specific in the sense that ClpB and ClpX chaperones were incapable of substituting for the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE system to activate π. The WT π physically interacted with DnaJ in the absence of ATP. The chaperone-activated π used the same replication origin γ to initiate replication, as did an active monomeric mutant form called π *(P42L/P106L/F107S). Bacterial Strains—The E. coli strain DH5α (F′/end 1, hsd R 17 (rk/mk)) gln v44 thi-1 rec A1 gyr A (Nalr) rel A1Δ (Lac YZA-arg F) U189 deoR [φ80 dLac Δ (LacZ) M15] was used for all of the cloning experiments, whereas the lon–E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) was used for the expression of all of the proteins.

Overexpression plasmids for the production of DnaK, DnaJ, ClpB, ClpX, and GrpE were constructed by PCR amplification of the reading frames whose coordinates and the oligonucleotides used are shown in Table I. The amplified DNA was restriction-digested and cloned into pET15b and pTXb1 and resulted in DnaK-pDZK03, DnaJ-pDZJ03, ClpB-pDZB04, ClpX-pDZX04, and GrpE-pDJE03.

S. A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The molar concentration of the proteins was calculated considering the monomeric molecular mass of each protein. The procedures for the purification of all of the proteins needed for in vitro replication have been described previously (18Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The chaperones were purified essentially through a single affinity column. The cells were grown to a density of 0.6 at 600 nm at 37 °C in L broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.4 mm). After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h 30 min, the cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm. The cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% sucrose, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME)) and lysed by sonication (3 × 30-s bursts with 5 min of cooling on ice between bursts). The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 for 20 min at 4 °C. DnaK and DnaJ supernatants were loaded onto a cobalt-affinity resin (TALON, BD Biosciences) previously equilibrated in buffer A (25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 300 mm KCl, 2 mm β-ME, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol) for DnaK (42Hupp T.R. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The columns were washed until the flow-through was clear. The protein was eluted with its respective buffer containing imidazole (100 mm). DnaK-His6- and DnaJ-His6-eluted fractions were pooled and further purified by Superose 12 column with their respective buffer without imidazole. These positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer C (25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, 400 mm KCl, 50% glycerol) and storage buffer D (25 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-ME, 50 mm KCl, 50% glycerol), respectively. The intein-chitin-binding domain fusion proteins (ClpB, ClpX, and GrpE) were purified on chitin-agarose affinity column (New England Biolabs) preequilibrated with buffer E (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2) for ClpB (43Park S.K.

J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) without reducing agents, and the columns were washed and incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with 30 mm dithiothreitol followed by 3 h of further incubation at 11 °C to complete the intein self-cleavage and release of the ClpB, ClpX, and GrpE moiety. Pooled fractions were further purified by Superose 12 column with their respective protein buffers (buffers E, F, and G), and the positive fractions were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer H, (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50% glycerol), storage buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.015% TX-114, 50% glycerol), and storage buffer J (buffer G + 50% glycerol), respectively, and stored at –80 °C. In Vitro Replication—The template used (see Fig. 11A) and the procedures for in vitro DNA replications with purified proteins were performed as described previously (18Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45476-45484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Reaction buffer contained 40 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 10% glycerol. The reactions were done in two steps. The step I contained 2 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 200 ng (5.55 pmol) of WT π protein, 1 μg (14.28 pmol) of DnaK, 150 ng (3.65 pmol) of DnaJ, and 50 ng (2.17 pmol) of GrpE protein in 10 μl of reaction buffer. These components were assembled on ice and, after the addition of the WT π initiator protein, preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Meanwhile, the step II components were assembled on ice in 20 μl and contained the buffer mentioned above along with 40 μm dNTPs, 3000 cpm/pmol [3H]dTTP, 3 mm ATP, 500 μm each of CTP, UTP, and GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 20 μg/ml creatine kinase type I (Sigma), DNA template pMA1 (200 ng), 1.0 μg of single strand-binding protein, 20 ng of integration host factor, 120 ng of DnaA, 0.5 units of RNase H, 600 ng of Gyrase AB, 100 ng of DnaB, 50 ng of DnaC, and 50 ng of DnaG. After the step I preincubation, the reaction mixture of step II in 20 μl was added to each tube supplemented further with 120 ng of reconstituted polymerase III holoenzyme to start the DNA synthesis. The standard reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30–60 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 20 μl of 0.2 m sodium pyrophosphate to each tube and precipitated with 500 μl of 10% chilled trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was trapped on a GF/C filter, washed with 95% ethanol, and air-dried, and total nucleotide incorporation was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The DNA synthesis was quantified by measuring the total pmol of acid-precipitable radioactivity in the reaction product. Origin Identification by ddNTP Incorporation—The reactions were carried out as described above but with the addition of [α-32P]dCTP, [α-32P]dATP, [α-32P]dGTP, and [α-32P]ddTTP from 25 to 75 μm. The reaction products were purified as described previously (18Abhyankar M.M. Zzaman S. Bastia D. J. Biol.

The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography and quantified with a phosphorimaging device using the ImageQuant™ software. Gel-shift Substrate—Substrate was made according to the published protocol (19Abhyankar M.M. Reddy J.M. Sharma R. Bullesbach E. Bastia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6711-6719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The π -binding direct repeat (iteron VII) DNA was excised from the pUC18-DR by digesting with EcoRI and HindIII. The resulting fragment (∼70 bp) was gel-purified using QiaQuick gel extraction kit. The DNA concentrations were measured by absorbance at 260 nm. The DNA fragment (2 pmol) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in a 50-μl reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then passed through Sephadex G-25 spin columns to separate labeled DNA from unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP. Gel-shift Assay—The binding of WT π with the iteron DNA fragment was carried out by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. 200 ng (5.55 pmol) of WT π was incubated with different chaperones in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.6), 40 mm potassium glutamate, and 150 mm NaCl at room temperature for 10 min. 40 fmol of labeled iteron DNA fragment was added to this mixture and incubated at room temperature for another 10 min. 2 μl of DNA loading dye was added, and the reaction mixture was loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide-Tris borate-EDTA gel and the complex formation was monitored by gel electrophoresis at 150 V for 3 h in 1× Tris borate-EDTA (89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The gels were analyzed and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant™ software. ELISA—Protein-protein interactions were performed by immobilizing different chaperones on the plastic surface of microtiter plates, and after blocking the unoccupied plastic surface with BSA, the immobilized proteins were incubated with various concentrations of WT π and the extent of interaction was detected with anti-π antibodies and secondary reporter-linked antibodies and the results were quantified with an ELISA plate reader as described previously (41Ratnakar P.V.A.L. Mohanty B.K. Lobert M. Bastia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5522-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purification of the Chaperones—Keeping in mind that the WT dimeric π retains specific DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions and therefore is biologically active, we reasoned that some chaperones are probably involved in the activation of this initiator in vivo. The principal goals that prompted this work were (i) to identify a chaperone or chaperone system that would monomerize and activate WT π and enhance its binding to a single iteron and, more importantly, allow it to catalyze the initiation of replication in vitro and (ii) to determine definitively using an in vitro reconstituted system that only chaperones but no other protein components were involved in the activation process. Although chaperone-mediated in vitro replication of plasmid DNA has been previously reported (26Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K.

The N-domain of cardiac troponin I contains two protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Although the physiological consequences of phosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 are known, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these functional changes have yet to be established. In this work, NMR was used to identify conformational and dynamic changes in cardiac troponin C upon binding a phosphomimetic troponin I, having Ser43/Ser45 mutated to Asp. Chemical shift perturbation mapping indicated that residues in helix G were most affected. Smaller chemical shift changes were observed in residues located in the Ca2+/Mg2+-binding loops. Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates in the C-lobe of troponin C were compared in complexes containing either the wild-type or phosphomimetic N-domain of troponin I. In the presence of a phosphomimetic domain, exchange rates in helix G increased, whereas a decrease in exchange rates for residues mapping to Ca2+/Mg2+-binding loops III and IV was observed. Increased exchange rates are consistent with destabilization of the Thr129–Asp132 helix capping box previously characterized in helix G. The perturbation of helix G and metal binding loops III and IV suggests that phosphorylation alters metal ion affinity and inter-subunit interactions.

Our studies support a novel mechanism for protein kinase C signal transduction, emphasizing the importance of C-lobe Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent troponin interactions. Troponin and tropomyosin form the Ca2+-sensitive switch that regulates striated muscle contraction. Troponin is a ternary assembly of proteins composed of the Ca2+-binding subunit troponin C (TnC), 1The abbreviations used are: TnC, troponin C (Ca2+ binding); TnI, troponin I (inhibitory); cTnC, recombinant cardiac troponin C (desMet1-Ala2, C35S); CcTnC, cTnC corresponding to residues 81–161; cTnI, cardiac TnI; cTnI(S43D/S45D), full-length recombinant mouse cTnI with the N-terminal Met cleaved during expression and purification and Ser43 and Ser45 mutated to Asp; NcTnI, recombinant mouse cTnI corresponding to residues 33–80 with the N-terminal Met cleaved during expression and purification; NcTnI(S43D/S45D), recombinant NcTnI with Ser43 and Ser45 mutated to Asp; PKC, protein kinase C; H/D, hydrogen/deuterium; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. the inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI), and the tropomyosin-binding protein troponin T that anchors troponin to the thin filament. Troponin C, a member of the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins, contains two globular domains connected by a linker. Each domain of cTnC contains two EF-hand or Ca2+-binding motifs. The N-lobe contains two lower affinity Ca2+-binding motifs, sites I and II, that control muscle contraction. Site I is naturally inactive in the cardiac isoform because of several amino acid substitutions and an amino acid insertion (1van Eerd J.P. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 64: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ binding at site II in cTnC regulates muscle contraction. The C-lobe contains two high affinity Ca2+-binding sites, III and IV, which also bind Mg2+ with lower affinity. Interactions between the C-lobe of cTnC and the N-domain of cTnI form the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC/cTnI interaction site. In addition, the C-lobe of cTnC also interacts tightly with the C terminus of cardiac troponin T (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). These interactions form the core of the troponin complex, tethering all three subunits throughout the contraction cycle. A variety of effectors can modulate the frequency and intensity of myocardial contraction by charge modification upon the phosphorylation of cTnI and cardiac troponin T. In the heart, phosphorylation of cTnI appears to be of particular importance in cardiac hypertrophy and failure (3Kobayashi T. Dong W-J. Burkart E.M. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J.

Although it is clear that PKC phosphorylation of cardiac troponin modulates contraction in response to hemodynamic stressors such as hypertension and myocardial infarction, the molecular mechanisms of this modulation remain unknown. The effects of PKC phosphorylation at Ser43 and Ser45 of cTnI can be mimicked, both in vitro and in vivo, by the introduction of negative charge at positions 43/45 (3Kobayashi T. Dong W-J.

Serine residues 43/45 of cTnI are at the N terminus of an amphiphilic α-helix that binds in a hydrophobic cleft in the C-lobe of cTnC (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Stability of the hydrophobic core in CcTnC is largely governed by metal binding at site III (12Brito R.M. Krudy G.A. Negele J.C. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20966-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange of Ca2+ for Mg2+ in Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites III and IV resulted in a partial closure of the hydrophobic binding cleft around site IV, allowing the possibility that Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange can modulate contraction via Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC/cTnI interactions (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Finley N. Dvoretsky A. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1439-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, even absent excess Ca2+, Mg2+ did not readily displace Ca2+ in the C-lobe of cTnC bound to NcTnI (14Finley N. Dvoretsky A. Rosevear P.R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1439-1446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To define the structural consequences resulting from cTnI phosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 by PKC, we have utilized solution NMR to identify residues in cTnC that are important in transmission of the phosphorylation signal. Backbone resonances in Ca2+-loaded [13C,15N]CcTnC bound to NcTnI(S43D/S45D) were assigned and used for secondary structure determination. The phosphorylation mimetics did not significantly alter the secondary structural elements of the paired Ca2+-binding motifs in CcTnC. Residues in CcTnC important for transmission of the phosphorylation signal were identified using chemical shift perturbation mapping and amide proton exchange. The phosphorylation mimetics induced localized conformational/dynamic perturbations in the N terminus of helix G and Ca2+/Mg2+-binding loops III and IV. Specifically, the presence of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI was found to destabilize the Thr129–Asp132 N-cap in helix G of CcTnC. Perturbation of N-cap interactions in helix G have been shown previously to decrease metal ion affinities at site III (15Trigo-Gonzalez G. Awang G. Racher K. Neden K. Borgford T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9826-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These findings support a mechanism for PKC modulation of cardiac contractility wherein the introduction of negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI results in altered C-lobe metal ion affinities and perturbation of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent protein-protein interactions. Presumably, these changes are transmitted to other regulatory and switch regions within cardiac troponin. These changes establish a role for the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC/cTnI interaction in transmitting the phosphorylation signal and modulating Ca2+ sensitivity. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Isotopically enriched and unlabeled recombinant proteins were expressed, purified, and quantified as described (16Abbott M.B. Gaponenko V.

Complex Formation and Resonance Assignment—Samples of Ca2+-saturated [2H,15N]cTnC or [13C,15N]CcTnC were combined in equimolar amounts with either cTnI(S43D/S45D) or NcTnI(S43D/S45D) to form stable binary complexes as described previously (16Abbott M.B. Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Li G. Dvoretsky A. Rance M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20610-20617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Binary complexes were judged 1:1 by native gel electrophoresis in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and by sensitivity-enhanced 1H-15N HSQC spectra (16Abbott M.B. Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N.

Samples for NMR were ∼1 mm in Ca2+-saturated protein in 20 mm Trisd11, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10% 2H2O. Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was used to prevent protein degradation during NMR analysis. NMR Methodology—Experiments were collected at 40 °C using 400, 600, and 800 MHz Varian Inova spectrometers equipped with pulse-field gradient units and triple resonance probes. Acquisition parameters for heteronuclear multidimensional NMR experiments and chemical shift referencing details can be found in Gasmi-Seabrook et al. (17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Inter-residue NOEs obtained from 15N-editied nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC experiments at mixing times of 70 and 150 ms were used to confirm consecutive assignments. 1H-15N transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy spectra of the intact binary complex [2H,15N]cTnC-cTnI(S43D/S45D) were acquired with 2048 points in the direct dimension, 64 points in the indirect dimension, and 320 scans per increment. Felix 2000 was employed to process and analyze NMR data. Amide 1H and 15N chemical shift differences were obtained by subtracting the respective chemical shifts for each residue in CcTnC-NcTnI from the amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts for the same residue in CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D). The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift difference for each residue was calculated using √[(Δ1H)2 + (Δ15N/7)2]. Hydrogena/Deuterium Exchange Experiments—Complexes consisting of ∼1 mm Ca2+-loaded [15N]CcTnC bound to NcTnI(S43D/S45D) or NcTnI were prepared in NMR buffer and lyophilized. To initiate hydrogen exchange, lyophilized samples were dissolved in 99.99% 2H2O. Amide exchange rates were measured from the decay of resonance intensity in successive 1H-15N HSQC spectra collected at 25 °C every 20 min. 1H-15N HSQC spectra were acquired with 1280 and 64 points in the direct and indirect dimensions, respectively, with eight scans per increment. Spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix. The volume of each amide cross-peak was normalized, and the ratio was fitted to a single exponential function, A = A0[exp - (-kext)]. Differences in CcTnC amide proton exchange rates, Δkex, were obtained by subtracting exchange rates for each residue in CcTnC-NcTnI from the same residue in CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D). NMR Signal Assignment and Secondary Structure—Changing a phosphorylation site to a negatively charged residue such as Asp or Glu can often be used to mimic phosphorylation and facilitate biophysical studies. Incorporation of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 by mutation was shown to provide functional mimetics for PKC phosphorylation of cTnI (4Sumandea M.P. Burkart E.M. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1015: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Burkart E.M. Arteaga G.M. Sumandea M.P. Prabhakar R. Wieczorek D.F. Solaro R.J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1285-1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A comparison between cTnI and cTnI(S43D/S45D) bound to Ca2+-loaded [2H,15N]cTnC was made. Chemical shift perturbation mapping was used to monitor conformational changes in cTnC induced by the introduction of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI in the intact binary complex. Amide proton chemical shift differences between Ca2+-loaded [2H,15N]cTnC-cTnI(S43D/S45D) and [2H,15N]cTnC-cTnI are shown in Fig. 1A. The majority of chemical shift perturbations induced by the mutation of Ser43/Ser45 to Asp were localized to the C-lobe of cTnC, with residues in helix G experiencing the largest chemical shift changes (Fig. 1A). Small amide proton chemical shift perturbations were observed for Glu66, Gly68, and Ser69 in the N-lobe of cTnC (Fig. 1A). These residues are located in the regulatory Ca2+-binding site (site II). Titration of cTnC with a cTnI peptide phosphorylated at Ser43/Ser45 was also found to induce small amide proton chemical shift perturbations in N-lobe residues corresponding to Gly42, Val72, and Val79 (19Li M.X. Wang X. Lindhout D.A. Buscemi N. Van Eyk J.E. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14460-14468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chemical shift perturbations may reflect charge-induced changes in local electrostatic interactions or changes in protein structure. It is unlikely that N-lobe chemical shift perturbations result from local electrostatic interactions, because these residues are >15 Å from the sites of cTnI phosphorylation in the core cardiac troponin structure (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). To examine in more detail conformational perturbations induced in the C-lobe of cTnC by PKC phosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI, we have studied a model phosphomimetic complex, CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D). NMR resonance assignments and solution structures for both Mg2+- and Ca2+-loaded CcTnC in the CcTnC-NcTnI complex are available (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Comparison of C-lobe chemical shift perturbations in cTnC-cTnI(S43D/S45D) and CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D) demonstrate that CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D) provides a suitable model for PKC phosphorylation-induced structural changes in the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC-cTnI interaction site (Fig. 1). This finding is consistent with the core cardiac troponin x-ray structure showing that NcTnI primarily makes contacts with the C-lobe of cTnC (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites Ser43/Ser45 in cTnI are located at the N terminus of helix H1 in cTnI, corresponding to residues 43–79 (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Residues 43–65 of cTnI bind to the hydrophobic cleft in CcTnC (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Two dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectroscopy was used to monitor individual amide resonances of residues in the C-lobe of cTnC upon complex formation with NcTnI(S43D/S45D). Only a single set of bound CcTnC amide resonances were observed as expected for high affinity binding (Kd < 1 μm) in the slow exchange regime. These results are consistent with isothermal titration microcalorimetry showing that bisphosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI-(1–64) had little effect on cTnC affinity (Ka ∼ 1 × 10-2 μm) (20Ward D.G. Brewer S.M. Gallon C.E. Gao Y. Levine B.A. Trayer I.P. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Backbone chemical shift assignments for Ca2+-loaded [13C,15N]CcTnC bound to NcTnI(S43D/S45D) were obtained using standard triple resonance assignment strategies (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resonance assignment strategy relied primarily on (Hβ)CβCα(CO)NNH, HNCαCβ, HNCα, and HNCO triple resonance experiments. Assignments were obtained for 75 of the 81 CcTnC amino acid residues. Backbone chemical shifts for the Cα,Cβ,C′, and Hα resonances were used to determine chemical shift index values for each residue in Ca2+-loaded CcTnC bound to NcTnI(S43D/S45D) (21Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The chemical shift index-determined secondary structure showed a characteristic paired EF-hand motif with four helices spanning residues 93–103 (E), 114–123 (F), 130–139 (G), and 150–158 (H), as well as two short β-strands extending from residues 111–113 and 147–149 (Fig. 1B). The overall secondary structure is analogous to that previously determined for Ca2+- and Mg2+-loaded CcTnC bound to NcTnI (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The similarity in secondary structure for CcTnC bound to NcTnI and NcTnI(S43D/S45D) justified the use of available C-lobe cTnC structures for interpreting changes in chemical shifts and H/D exchange rates upon the introduction of a negative charge at the two PKC phosphorylation sites (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chemical Shift Mapping—Chemical shifts are sensitive to the local environment and can be used to monitor subtle structural changes. We have shown previously that amide chemical shifts for cTnC are extremely sensitive to the small conformational changes that occur upon cAMP-dependent protein kinase A phosphorylation of cTnI (22Finley N. Abbott M.B. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Dong W. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Howarth J.W. Rance M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Rosevear P.R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5992-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts for the 1HN, 15NH, 13Cα, and 13Cβ resonances in CcTnC-NcTnI (17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were used for a residue-by-residue comparison with the chemical shifts obtained in CcTnC-NcTnI(S43D/S45D). Perturbations in the combined 1HN/15NH and 13Cα/13Cβ chemical shifts are plotted on the structure of Ca2+-loaded CcTnC bound to NcTnI (Fig. 2). The largest 1HN/15NH chemical shift perturbations were observed in the N terminus of helix G, Ile128 and Thr129, and in helix E, Glu95 (Fig. 1B). These residues cluster around the N-cTnI-binding site (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Threonine 129 is the N-cap residue in the N-terminal helix capping box of helix G in both Ca2+- and Mg2+-loaded CcTnC-NcTnI complexes (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In both complexes, the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr129 hydrogen bonds to the amide of Asp132, and the Asp side-chain, in turn, forms a hydrogen bond with the amide of Thr129 (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The upfield amide proton chemical shift for Thr129 in the phosphomimetic complex is consistent with destabilization of the hydrogen bond between the amide of Thr129 (N-cap residue) and the carboxylate side-chain of Asp132 (N3 residue). The 3JNH-Cα coupling constant for Thr129 decreased slightly from 9 Hz (17Gasmi-Seabrook G.M. Howarth J.W. Finley N. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Brito R.M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8313-8322Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to 8.3 Hz in the phosphomimetic complex, consistent with a decrease in the average φ backbone torsion angle. Changes in the amide proton chemical shift and the 3JNH-Cα coupling constant for Thr129 are consistent with destabilization of the N-terminal helix G capping box. In addition, upfield amide nitrogen chemical shifts are also observed for Ile128 and Thr129 in the phosphomimetic complex (data not shown). Hydrophobic interactions between the N′ residue (Ile128) and the N4 residue (Ile133) stabilize the N-cap box (24Harper E.T. Rose G.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Such stabilizing interactions would be expected to deshield the amide nitrogen resonances of Ile128 and Thr129. However, destabilization of the hydrogen-bonding network in the Thr129–Asp132 N-cap box would reverse this effect, shifting the amide nitrogen resonances upfield as observed in the phosphomimetic complex. Chemical shift perturbations were also observed in 13Cα and 13Cβ resonances of CcTnC residues upon the introduction of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 in cTnI. Residues showing the largest 13Cα/13Cβ chemical shift changes are located in helix E (Leu-97, Phe101, and Phe104), helix F (Leu117 and Leu121), and helix H (Phe153, Leu154, and Phe156) (Fig. 2B). Hydrophobic and polar residues identified by chemical shift indexing form contiguous surfaces that define the binding interface between CcTnC and NcTnI within the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC-NcTnI interaction site (Fig. 2C). Residues 43–65 of cTnI form an amphiphilic α-helix that binds to the C-lobe hydrophobic crevice via multiple polar and Van der Waals interactions (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), similar to the interactions observed in the skeletal sTnC-sTnI (1–47) complex (25Vassylyev D.G. Takeda S. Wakatsuki S. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4847-4852Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange—Changes in local dynamic behavior have also been utilized to identify residues that undergo conformational change accompanying protein binding. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange allows characterization of changes in global thermodynamic stability and local conformational motion with exchange time constants on the order of minutes to days. Whereas chemical shifts report on the magnetic environment of nuclei, H/D exchange kinetics provides information about backbone dynamics, conformation, and proton-solvent interactions. Comparison of H/D exchange rates provides a mechanism to assess the effects of the PKC phosphorylation mimetics on conformational fluctuations in CcTnC. To this end, amide proton H/D exchange rates in [15N]CcTnC bound to either NcTnI or NcTnI(S43D/S45D) were measured at 25 °C. At temperatures >25 °C, many of the exchange rates were too fast to reliably measure, whereas temperatures <25 °C resulted in the broadening of 1H-15N correlations. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange rates could be monitored for 59 of the 75 assigned 1H-15N correlations in the HSQC spectrum of CcTnC. The remaining resides were excluded from analysis because of weak signal intensity and/or resonance overlap. The amide proton exchange kinetics could be classified into five categories, namely rapidly exchanging (within the first 20 min), fast (kex > 8.5 × 10-2 min-1), moderately fast (8.5 × 10-3 min-1 < kex < 8.5 × 10-2 min-1), slow (2.5 × 10-3 min-1 < kex < 8.5 × 10-3 min-1), and very slow (kex < 2.5 × 10-3 min-1) (Table I). Rapidly exchanging amide correlations, disappearing within the first 20 min of exchange in both complexes, were assigned to residues Asp87, Asp88, Ser89, Lys90, Gly91, Lys92, Thr93, Glu94, Ser98, Asp99, Arg102, Met120, Thr124, Gly125, Glu126, Thr127, Glu130, Asn144, Glu152, and Gly159. Most of these correspond to residues that are located in unstructured or mobile loop regions (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The time course of H/D exchange for 28 residues could be followed in both complexes and used to calculate exchange rates (Table I). The introduction of a negative charge mimicking PKC phosphorylation in NcTnI was found to both increase and decrease the amide proton H/D exchange rates of selective residues in CcTnC (Table I and Fig. 3). A comparison of 1H-15N correlation spectra of CcTnC bound to NcTnI(S43D/S45D) and NcTnI after 330 min of exchange into 2H2O shows that the amide proton of Ile133 exchanges faster in the phosphomimetic complex (Fig. 3). Isoleucine 133 is located in helix G immediately following the Thr129–Asp132 N-cap box. The H/D exchange rates for Thr129, Asp132, Ile133, and Glu135, located in helix G of CcTnC, were also increased in the phosphomimetic complex (Table I and Fig. 4). These residues are involved both in stabilizing N-terminal helix capping interactions and in the (i) to (i + 3) hydrogen bonds typical of α-helices. In addition, Asp132 and Glu135 participate in interresidue polar interactions with Arg45 and Lys46 of cTnI (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Thus, the introduction of proximal negative charge in cTnI weakens the substantial hydrogen-bonding lattice in helix G, altering Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent interactions between cTnI and the C-lobe of cTnC.Table IAmide H/D exchange rates for CcTnC bound to NcTnI and the PKC phosphorylation mimetic NcTnI(S43D/S45D)CcTnC residueaResonance assignments for residues 81–86 could not be confirmed.

Both Asn107 and Asn143 occupy position 3 within Ca2+/Mg2+ binding loops III and IV, respectively. The amide proton of the residue at position 3 is known to hydrogen bond with the side-chain carboxylate of Asp at position 12 (26Strynadka N.L. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in amide proton H/D exchange is consistent with increased hydrogen bonding interactions between the amide protons of Asn107 and Asn143 and the carboxylate groups of Glu116 and Glu152, respectively. Decreased amide H/D exchange in the PKC phosphomimetic complex is also observed for Ala108, Gly110, Asp113, and Glu115 in site III and for Gly146 in site IV (Table I and Fig. 4). The side chain of Asp113, located at the ninth position in Ca2+/Mg2+ binding loop III, directly coordinates the bound metal ion. Amide protons of Gly110 and Gly146, located at the sixth position in Ca2+/Mg2+ binding loop III and IV, respectively, hydrogen bond to the carboxylate side chain of the conserved Asp residues at position 1 (12Brito R.M. Krudy G.A. Negele J.C. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20966-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decreased H/D exchange for residues within Ca2+/Mg2+ binding loops III and IV is consistent with the stabilization of intra-loop hydrogen bonding interactions and the compaction of the metal binding loops in the phosphomimetic complex. These changes suggest that phosphorylation of NcTnI alters the conformation of Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites III and IV, possibly resulting in altered metal ion affinity and Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange. Summary—The structural consequences of PKC phosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI on cTnC have been examined using chemical shift mapping and H/D exchange. To facilitate structural studies, PKC phosphorylation mimetics of cTnI having Ser43/Ser45 mutated to Asp were utilized. The overall picture obtained from chemical shift mapping shows structural perturbations predominately localized to the C-lobe of cTnC, with smaller N-lobe perturbations around Ca2+-binding site II (Fig. 1). Distances between N-lobe Ca2+-binding sites and Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI in the core cardiac troponin structure (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar) suggest that chemical shift perturbations in Ca2+-binding site II are the result of long range effects as opposed to direct binding interactions. Recently, measurement of fluorescence resonance energy transfer distance distributions from a single cTnC donor/acceptor pair in cTnC-cTnI and cTnC-cTnI(S43E/S45E, T144E) showed that the introduction of a negative charge in cTnI alters N-lobe conformational equilibria (3Kobayashi T. Dong W-J. Burkart E.M. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Previously we showed that amide chemical shifts could be utilized to monitor conformation equilibria between open and closed N-lobe substates (16Abbott M.B. Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Finley N. Li G. Dvoretsky A. Rance M. Solaro R.J. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20610-20617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We see no evidence that the introduction of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI significantly alters conformational equilibria in the N-lobe of cTnC (Fig. 1). It is likely that the N-lobe conformational change detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis (3Kobayashi T. Dong W-J. Burkart E.M. Cheung H.C. Solaro R.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) results from the additional negative charge at Thr144 of cTnI. This probability is consistent with N-lobe conformational changes detected by NMR chemical shift analysis of cTnC binding to a cTnI regulatory peptide phosphorylated at Thr144 (19Li M.X. Wang X. Lindhout D.A. Buscemi N. Van Eyk J.E. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14460-14468Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results help clarify the molecular consequences of PKC phosphorylation at Ser43, Ser45, and Thr144 in cTnI on Ca2+-loaded cTnC. Phosphorylation of Ser43/Ser45 in cTnI induces conformational perturbations in the C-lobe of cTnC containing Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites III and IV, whereas phosphorylation at Thr144 directly alters conformational equilibria in the N-lobe of cTnC containing Ca2+-binding site II. A combination of chemical shift mapping and H/D exchange was used to examine conformational perturbations in the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC-cTnI interaction site induced by the introduction of a negative charge at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI. Chemical shift mapping identified structural perturbations in CcTnC residues lining the NcTnI hydrophobic binding cleft (Fig. 2). Amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange results are consistent with the destabilization of N-terminal helix G-capping interactions and the conformational perturbation of Ca2+/Mg2+-binding sites III and IV (Fig. 4). Whereas metal binding at site III is primarily responsible for stabilizing the hydrophobic core (12Brito R.M. Krudy G.A. Negele J.C. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20966-20973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), helix-capping interactions are known to increase domain stability and accelerate folding (28Kapp G.T. Richardson J.S. Oas T.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3814-3823Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Destabilization of N-cap interactions in helices C and G by mutation have been shown to decrease Ca2+-binding affinity in TnC (15Trigo-Gonzalez G. Awang G. Racher K. Neden K. Borgford T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9826-9831Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Leblanc L. Bennet A. Borgford T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 296-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, weakening of the hydrogen-bonding lattice in helix G would be expected to alter metal ion affinity and Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange at site IV. Microcalorimetry data suggest that Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent protein-protein interactions are 8-fold stronger in the presence of Ca2+ than in the presence of Mg2+ (29Calvert M.J. Ward D.G. Trayer H.R. Trayer I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32508-32515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Substitution of Mg2+ for Ca2+ in CcTnC bound to NcTnI is characterized by condensation of the C-terminal portion of the metal binding loops and partial closure of the cTnI hydrophobic binding cleft around site IV (13Finley N.L. Howarth J.W. Rosevear P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11371-11379Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The close association between helix stability and metal ion affinity provides an attractive model for modulating Ca2+/Mg2+ exchange and Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent protein-protein interactions by PKC phosphorylation. A negative charge introduced at Ser43/Ser45 of cTnI, either by mutation or phosphorylation, is expected to stabilize the NcTnI helix through favorable electrostatic interactions between neighboring polar side chains and the helix backbone (30Smart J.L. McCammon J.A. Biopolymers. 1999; 49: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Residues 43–65 in cTnI form a α-helix that binds to the C-lobe of cTnC through multiple polar and van der Waals interactions (2Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Computational analyses of cTnI having Glu substituted at Ser43/Ser45 suggest that the incorporation of a negative charge extends the N terminus of the cTnI helix to residue 40 (4Sumandea M.P. Burkart E.M. Kobayashi T. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1015: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Solution analysis of the secondary structure of NcTnI bound to CcTnC, based on experimentally determined chemical shift index values, suggests that the NcTnI helix begins at residue 46. The mutation of Ser43/Ser45 to Asp stabilizes and extends the N terminus by three residues, from residue 46 in NcTnI to residue 43 in NcTnI(S43D/S45D). 2N. L. Finley, unpublished results. Structural changes in CcTnC and NcTnI induced by the phosphorylation of Ser43/Ser45 support a mechanism for PKC modulation of cardiac contractility wherein the introduction of a negative charge results in altered C-lobe metal ion affinities and perturbation of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent protein-protein interactions. Structural changes in NcTnI and CcTnC, forming the Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent protein-protein interaction site, can then be transmitted to other regulatory or switch regions in troponin. These studies emphasize the importance of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent cTnC-cTnI protein-protein interactions in the modulation of cardiac contractility."
https://openalex.org/W1980604503,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine with pleiotropic immunological and biological activities. TNFα signaling is triggered by the engagement of soluble TNFα to two types of cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. This recruits cytosolic proteins to the intracellular domains of the receptors and initiates signaling to downstream effectors. In this study, we used a proteomic approach to identify these cytosolic proteins from affinity-purified, endogenous TNFα·TNFR complexes in human myelomonocytic U937 cells. Seven proteins were identified, including TRADD, TRAP2, and TRAF2, which are three proteins known to be recruited to TNFα receptors. NAK, RasGAP3, TRCP1, and TRCP2 were also identified. We further showed that NAK is recruited to TNFR1 in a temporally regulated and TNFα-dependent manner and that it mediates the TNFα-induced production of the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted). These data demonstrate that NAK is a component of the TNFα·TNFR1 signaling complex and confirm the physiological role of NAK in the TNFα-mediated response.

It is produced by many cell types including macrophages, monocytes, lymphocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts in response to inflammation or infection. Human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease are associated with inappropriate production of TNFα or sustained activation of TNFα signaling. Therefore, understanding the regulation of TNFα production and signals transmitted by TNFα is necessary for the development of effective treatments for these diseases.The pleiotropic biological activities of TNFα are mediated by its binding to two different cell surface receptors, the TNF receptor type I (TNFR1) and the TNF receptor type II (TNFR2) (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Neither of these receptors possesses enzymatic activities. Signals transduced from these receptors are mediated by cytosolic proteins recruited to the receptors, and their intracellular domains share no significant homology, suggesting that they may interact with different cellular proteins. Gene knockout experiments confirm that TNFR1 and TNFR2 control different signaling cascades and that the majority of TNFα signaling events are mediated by TNFR1 (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar).Binding of TNFα to TNFR1 induces homotrimerization of the receptors and recruits cytosolic proteins (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). These proximal events activate multiple downstream pathways, including activation of two transcription factors NFκB and AP-1 and activation of those pathways that lead to apoptosis. Over the last decade, many of the molecular mechanisms of TNFα signaling have begun to be deciphered through the identification of proteins that are recruited to the TNF receptors. Upon TNFα binding, TRADD is first recruited to TNFR1 and provides a platform for the recruitment of other death domain-containing proteins, such as receptor interacting protein and Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain (5Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 6Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B.

Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). TRAF2, a member of the TRAF family of proteins that does not contain the death domain, is recruited to TNFR1 via TRADD (9Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). TRAF2 is also an adaptor protein of TNFR2 (10Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Given the very low abundance of the endogenous receptors and proteins recruited to the receptors, together with the limits of the protein identification, most of these proteins were identified under the conditions of overexpression utilized in yeast two-hybrid systems or by affinity purification using recombinant proteins. Therefore, little is known about the composition of the endogenous receptor complex.Activation of NFκB is one of the major pathways by which TNFα induces the expression of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses (4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). NFκB is composed of homo- or heterodimers of Rel family members (11Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar), but the most common form consists of a p50/p65 heterodimer. NFκB is retained in the cytoplasm by a family of inhibitory proteins known as IκB proteins. In response to TNFα, the IκB proteins are phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which contains IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ subunits (12Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated IκB is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome. NFκB then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to specific promoter sequences termed κB elements and thereby activates the transcription of NFκB-driven genes. The IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα on serine 32 and serine 36. NAK (also known as TRAF2-associated kinase or TRAF family member-associated NFκB activator-binding kinase 1) shares a high degree of homology with IKKα and IKKβ and phosphorylates IκBα on serine 36 but not serine 32 in vitro (13Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M.

Thus, it has been proposed to be a member of the IKK family of kinases (13Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M.

Nak–/– mice have similar phenotypes to Ikkβ–/–, Ikkγ–/–, and RelA–/– mice in that they all die at embryonic day 14.5 from massive liver degeneration and apoptosis, which is consistent with this proposal (15Bonnard M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 854-862PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in Nak–/– mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, the transcription of two NFκB-driven genes, TLR2 and ICAM, are deficient in response to TNFα (15Bonnard M. Mirtsos C. Suzuki S. Graham K. Huang J. Ng M. Itie A. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Henzel W.J. Elia A.J. Shillinglaw W. Mak T.W. Cao Z. Yeh W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, in these cells, IκBα degradation and the binding of NFκB to κB DNA elements are normal. Based on these observations, it has been suggested that NAK may phosphorylate the p65 subunit of NFκB or act through an unidentified factor to regulate the activation of the NFκB (13Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M. Nature. 2000; 404: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although NAK clearly plays an essential role in the transcription of a subset of TNFα-induced NFκB driven genes, the precise involvement of NAK in TNFα signaling has remained elusive.In this study, we explored the composition of the endogenous TNFα·TNFR1 complex using a proteomic approach. Compared with conventional protein identification technologies, the mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach used here has a high sensitivity (down to fmol detection levels) and can handle a high complexity of samples, which allowed us to identify low abundance proteins from an endogenous complex without purifying each individual protein. We affinity-purified the endogenous TNFα·TNFR receptor complex from U937 cells using FLAG-tagged TNFα. Proteins co-purified in the complex were first eluted with FLAG peptides and then with 8 m urea. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Seven proteins, TRADD, TRAF2, TRAP2, NAK, RasGAP3, and two novel proteins were identified in the complex. We also demonstrated that recruitment of NAK to TNFR1 is temporally regulated and TNFα-dependent and that endogenous NAK is required for the TNFα-induced production of the chemokine RANTES.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture, Antibodies, and Reagents—U937 and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-TNFR1 antibody (AF225) was purchased from R & D Systems. Anti-TRADD, -TRAF2, and -NAK (M-375) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody and affinity beads were obtained from Sigma. Antihemagglutinin antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science. All chemical reagents otherwise specified were purchased from Sigma. Human FLAG-NAK was cloned by PCR from a human ovary cDNA library (BD Biosciences) into pENTR/S.D./D-TOPO vector using directional TOPO cloning kits from Invitrogen and subsequently cloned into expression vector pAdori-DV (a Wyeth proprietary vector). Mutation of K38M was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using PCR and cloned into pAdori-DV vector as described above.Purification of Endogenous TNFα Receptor Complex—1 × 1010 U937 cells were harvested and washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C) and then resuspended to 1 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml of FLAG-TNFα (Alexis Biochemicals) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed in 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor mixtures) (Roche Applied Science) and gently rocked at 4 °C for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation twice at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The lysate was preclarified by incubation with GammaBind™ beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The resulting lysate was immunoprecipitated using M2 affinity beads (Sigma). The immunocomplex was first eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma) at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. The residual binding proteins were then further eluted with 8 m urea. One-half of the peptide-eluted proteins or 1/10 of the 8 m urea-eluted proteins was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-TRADD or -TRAF2 antibody. The remainders of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining.Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Protein bands of interest were manually excised from the gel, reduced, and alkylated with iodoacetamide and then digested in situ with trypsin using an automated digestion robot (ABIMED) as described previously (21Houthaeve T. Gausepohl H. Ashman K. Nillson T. Mann M. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The peptide digests were then sequenced using a high throughput tandem mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest LCQ-DECA, San Jose CA) equipped with a microelectrospray reversed-phase liquid chromatography interface. Data were acquired in automated MS/MS mode using the data acquisition software provided with the LCQ to detect and sequence each peptide as it eluted from the column. The dynamic exclusion and isotope exclusion functions were employed to increase the number of peptide ions that were analyzed. During the LC-MS-MS run, typically >1000 fragmentation spectra were collected from each sample and matched against the nonredundant databases (NCBI) using the Sequest software package (ThermoQuest).Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—For immunoprecipitation, 1 × 108 U937 cells were treated with FLAG-TNFα at 100 ng/ml for different times or left untreated. Cell lysates were prepared as described above and subjected to immunoprecipitation using either M2 beads or TNFR1 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblots probed with anti-NAK, -TRADD, or -TRAF2 antibodies. Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL detection kits (Amersham Biosciences).Analysis of RANTES Production and Kinase Assays—293T cells were seeded on 6-well plates and transfected with either vector alone, NAK, or NAK(K38M) expression vectors using calcium phosphate (ProFection Mammalian Transfection System, Promega). After 48 h, the cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml TNFα for 24 h or left untreated. Cell supernatants were collected and analyzed for RANTES by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (BioSource International). The cells were harvested and lysed as described above. FLAG-NAK proteins were immunoprecipitated with M2 beads and analyzed for kinase activity using biotin-AKELDQGSLCTS-FVGTLQKKK peptides derived from IKKβ as substrates (22Kishore N. Huynh Q.K. Mathialagan S. Hall T. Rouw S. Creely D. Lange G. Caroll J. Reitz B. Donnelly A. Boddupalli H. Combs R.G. Kretzmer K. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13840-13847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 33 μm ATP, 330 μCi of [33P]ATP and 267 μm peptide. Peptides were then separated from each reaction mixture by passing the reaction mixture through a P81 phosphocellulose membrane (Whatman) under a vacuum manifold. The extent of peptide phosphorylation on each membrane was determined by standard liquid scintillation counting. The immunoprecipitates were also subjected to immunoblot analysis to assess the relative amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins.Small Interfering RNA—A pool of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting NAK was purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (catalog number M-003788-02, Lafayette, Chicago). The human HEK293 cell line was transfected with the siRNA smart pool targeting NAK or scrambled RNAs (catalog number D-001200-01-80, Dharmacon, Inc.) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, the cells were treated with TNFα for 40 h. RANTES production was measured in the medium by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of NAK, IKKα, and IKKβ transcripts were determined by Taqman using standard manufacturer's protocols. The fold changes of the mRNAs were all normalized to the housekeeping gene β-2-microglobulin. The primers and probes for NAK (catalog number Hs00179410_m1), IKKβ (catalog number Hs00233287_m1), and β-2-microglobulin (catalog number Hs99999907_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California). Primers for IKKα (forward, 5′-CAGGTTCTCTTCCT-GGCATCA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTTCGATGAGAAGGGGATACTG-3′) were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa) and probe (5′-TGATTACACCAACTCCTT-3′) was ordered from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPurification of the Endogenous TNFα·TNFR Complex from U937 Cells—Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are expressed in U937 cells (23Murphy M. Walter B.N. Pike-Nobile L. Fanger N.A. Guyre P.M. Browning J.L. Ware C.F. Epstein L.B. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The binding of TNFα to these receptors triggers their homotrimerization and the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to the receptor tails. The activated receptors, together with the recruited cytosolic proteins, constitute the TNFα·TNFR complex. To understand the composition of the endogenous TNFα·TNFR complex, we treated U937 cells with FLAG-tagged TNFα and affinity purified the TNFα·TNFR complex using anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads. TNFα interacts with both receptors, and therefore it was assumed that the TNFα·TNFR complex contains both TNFα·TNFR1 and TNFα·TNFR2 and that proteins associated with either of these receptors would be co-purified.After purification, the bound complex was eluted with FLAG peptides. Proteins eluted from the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining (Fig. 1A). Approximately 12 protein bands were seen in the eluted complex, but none of these bands were present in the sample from cells without TNFα stimulation. Thus, these proteins were specifically associated with the TNFα·TNFR complex. As a control, TRADD and TRAF2 were detected by immunoblotting in the eluates from TNFα-treated cells (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we conclude that the active TNFα·TNFR complex was formed and purified.Identification of Proteins Co-purified with the Receptor Complex by Mass Spectrometry—To identify the proteins co-purified with the TNFα·TNFR complex, we excised the 12 bands from the silver-stained gel shown in Fig. 1A and analyzed them by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) after in-gel digestion (see “Materials and Methods”). As expected, TNFα and TRADD were detected in band 12 and band 9, respectively (Table I). Surprisingly, we were unable to detect any peptides of TRAF2 at the expected position of band 7, where we had detected it by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B). Proteins in other bands either could not be determined because of the poor quality of the spectrum or later turned out to be nonspecific binding proteins, such as Hsp90 and Hsp71 in band 4 and tropomyosin in band 10.Table IList of proteins identified in TNFα·TNFR1 complexProteinsGenBank™ identification number (gi)PositionaF stands for bands in FLAG-eluted sample; U stands for bands in 8 m urea-eluted sample.

Numbers correspond to what is indicated in Fig. 1. Open table in a new tab In a previous study, we found that FLAG peptides only elute 1/10 of the proteins that bound to the beads (24Kuai J. Nickbarg E. Wooters J. Qiu Y. Wang J. Lin L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14363-14369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We observed the same phenomenon in the present study as indicated by the low recovery (∼10%) of total TRADD on the beads judged by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). This low efficiency of elution was probably due to the multimeric and high affinity interactions between M2 antibodies and trimerized FLAG· TNFα·TNFR complex. To increase the amount of proteins eluted from the beads, we treated the beads further with 8 m urea and resolved the eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE. However, 8 m urea also eluted nonspecific binding proteins, resulting in a pattern that was indistinguishable between the untreated and TNFα-treated samples on the silver-stained gel (data not shown). Therefore, we excised the areas that corresponded to the peptide-eluted bands shown in Fig. 1A and then analyzed these bands by mass spectrometry. Proteins identified from the 8 m urea eluates of the untreated sample were proteins that bound non-specifically to the M2 beads. These proteins were subtracted from the total proteins identified in the 8 m urea eluates of the TNFα-treated sample. This resulted in a list of proteins that specifically associated with the TNFα·TNFR complex (Table I).In the 8 m urea eluates of the TNFα-treated sample, seven peptides of TRAF2 were detected at the band 7 position, and these peptides were totally absent in the control. Peptides of TNFα and TRADD were also detected in the 8 m urea eluates, as were two peptides of TNFR1 and one peptide of TNFR2. The presence of TNFR1, TNFR2, TRADD, and TRAF2 in the 8 m urea eluates demonstrates that the 8 m urea eluates contained components of both TNFα·TNFR1 and TNFα·TNFR2 complexes.Five additional proteins were detected in the 8 m urea eluates (Table I). Among them, TRAP2, also known as subunit 2 of the 26 S proteasome, was previously identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with the intracellular domain of TNFR1 (25Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Wallach D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 367: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26Dunbar J.D. Song H.Y. Guo D. Wu L.W. Donner D.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4252-4259PubMed Google Scholar). The detection of TRAP2 in our endogenous TNFα·TNFR1 complex demonstrated that TRAP2 associates with TNFR1 under physiological conditions. Together, these observations suggest a direct interaction of TNFα signaling with the 26 S proteosome-mediated protein degradation. Given the proteasome-mediated degradation of phosphorylated IκB during the activation of NFκB, it is conceivable that the regulation of proteosome activity is coupled to the activation of NFκB during TNFα signaling.NAK, an IKK family kinase that has been reported to play a critical role in the TNFα-induced activation of NFκB (13Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M.

Mak T.W. Cao Z. Yeh W.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4976-4985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was also detected. Thus, there exists a physiological association of NAK with the TNFα·TNFR complex, which confirms and extends the previous observations and unequivocally demonstrates a role for NAK in TNFα signaling under physiological conditions.We also detected RasGAP3, and two novel proteins KIAA0143 (gi2495710) and FLJ20758 (gi17433930), which we named TRCP1 and TRCP2 (TNF receptor complex proteins 1 and 2), respectively. RasGAP3 is an inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) binding protein that belongs to the GTPase-activating protein-1 (GAP1) family (27Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1995; 376: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). RasGAP3 contains a highly conserved RasGAP domain and a pleckstrin homology domain that localizes it to the plasma membrane (28Cozier G.E. Lockyer P.J. Reynolds J.S. Kupzig S. Bottomley J.R. Millard T.H. Banting G. Cullen P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28261-28268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Lockyer P.J. Bottomley J.R. Reynolds J.S. McNulty T.J. Venkateswarlu K. Potter B.V. Dempsey C.E. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 1007-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RasGAP3 has not been previously implicated in TNFα signaling; however, MAP kinase-activating death domain protein, another death domain containing protein that interacts with TNFR1, contains a guanine nucleotide exchange domain of the small GTPase Rab (30Schievella A.R.

Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The association of the TNFR complex with proteins that regulate the activities of small GTPases links TNFα signaling to small GTPases. TRCP1 encodes 885 amino acids, and 6 peptides were identified in the 8 m urea eluates (Table I). TRCP2 has 689 amino acids, and 8 peptides were identified (Table I). We did not find any functional domains in TRCP1 and TRCP2. Identification of the specific TNFR receptors with which TRCP1, TRCP2, and RasGAP3 interact and their functions in TNFα signaling require further investigation.NAK Is Recruited to the TNFR1 Receptor in a TNFα-dependent Manner and Mediates the TNFα-induced Production of the Chemokine RANTES—We next tested whether NAK associates with TNFR1 using immunoprecipitation assays with an anti-TNFR1 antibody. As seen in Fig. 2, similar patterns of NAK recruitment were observed in immunoprecipitates using either anti-TNFR1 antibody or anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, confirming that NAK was indeed recruited to TNFR1. Moreover, this recruitment was temporally regulated. It peaked between 5 and 10 min, later than TRADD and TRAF2, which peaked as early as 2 min. NAK has been reported to associate with TRAF2 (13Tojima Y. Fujimoto A. Delhase M. Chen Y. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Kaneko Y. Nimura Y. Motoyama N. Ikeda K. Karin M. Nakanishi M.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that TRAF2 mediates the recruitment of NAK to the complex. Importantly, similar to the TNFα-dependent recruitment of TRADD and TRAF2, the recruitment of NAK was also dependent upon TNFα treatment (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Time- and TNFα-dependent recruitment of NAK to TNFR1 complex.
