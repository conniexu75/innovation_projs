https://openalex.org/W3087333805,"Plastic pollution is a planetary threat, affecting nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem globally. In response, multilevel mitigation strategies are being adopted but with a lack of quantitative assessment of how such strategies reduce plastic emissions. We assessed the impact of three broad management strategies, plastic waste reduction, waste management, and environmental recovery, at different levels of effort to estimate plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries. We estimate that 19 to 23 million metric tons, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems. Considering the ambitious commitments currently set by governments, annual emissions may reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030. To reduce emissions to a level well below this prediction, extraordinary efforts to transform the global plastics economy are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3087356468,"Superspreading events (SSEs) have characterized previous epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections1–6. For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. Using contact tracing data from 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed between 23 January and 28 April 2020 in Hong Kong, we identified and characterized all local clusters of infection. We identified 4–7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n = 309 cases) and estimated that 19% (95% confidence interval, 15–24%) of cases seeded 80% of all local transmission. Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P = 0.002). Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P = 0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9–107.2). Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Cases linked to superspreading events are estimated to account for 80% of all local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Hong Kong in a study with implications for public health policies."
https://openalex.org/W3014364737,"Social distancing interventions can be effective against epidemics but are potentially detrimental for the economy. Businesses that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or close physical proximity when producing a product or providing a service are particularly vulnerable. There is, however, no systematic evidence about the role of human interactions across different lines of business and about which will be the most limited by social distancing. Here we provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human interaction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49 million workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face communication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model suggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half, they need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in communication. Retail, hotels and restaurants, arts and entertainment and schools are the most affected sectors. Our results can help target fiscal assistance to businesses that are most disrupted by social distancing."

The first-line treatment for CKD is dietary intervention, so there may be a gut microbiota–associated component. Lobel et al. investigated the mechanistic links between the microbiota and protein intake, because the protein metabolites indole and indoxyl sulfate are known uremic toxins (see the Perspective by Pluznick). The authors used a mouse model of CKD precipitated by a paucity of the dietary sulfur–containing amino acids methionine and cysteine. Bacterial metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids modulated indole production by sulfide inhibition of the enzyme tryptophanase, thus abrogating uremic toxicity by this metabolite in this model system.

https://openalex.org/W3087711113,"Water has many anomalous properties compared to ""simple"" liquids, and these anomalies are typically enhanced in supercooled water. While numerous models have been proposed, including the liquid-liquid critical point, the singularity-free scenario, and the stability limit conjecture, a molecular-level understanding remains elusive.The main difficulty in determining which, if any, of these models is correct is the limited amount of data in the relevant temperature and pressure ranges. For water at ambient pressures, which is the focus of this work, data is largely missing from 160 - 232 K due to rapid crystallization. Whether rapid crystallization is just an experimental obstacle, or a fundamental problem signaling the inability of water to thermally equilibrate prior to crystallization is also a major unanswered question. Here, we investigate the structural transformations of transiently-heated, supercooled water with nanosecond time resolution using infrared vibrational spectroscopy. The experiments demonstrate three key results. First, water's structure relaxes from its initial configuration to a ""steady-state"" configuration prior to the onset of crystallization over a wide temperature range. Second, water's steady-state structure can be reproduced by a linear combination of two, temperature-independent structures that correspond to a ""high-temperature liquid"" and a ""low-temperature liquid."" Third, the observed structural changes are reversible over the full temperature range. Taken together, these results show that supercooled water can equilibrate prior to crystallization for temperatures from the homogeneous nucleation temperature down to the glass transition temperature. Second, the results provide support for the hypothesis that supercooled water can be described as a mixture of two, structurally-distinct, interconvertible liquids from 135 K to 245 K."
https://openalex.org/W3087645851,"Brazil detected community transmission of COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. In this study we identified which areas in the country were the most vulnerable for COVID-19, both in terms of the risk of arrival of cases, the risk of sustained transmission and their social vulnerability. Probabilistic models were used to calculate the probability of COVID-19 spread from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the initial hotspots, using mobility data from the pre-epidemic period, while multivariate cluster analysis of socio-economic indices was done to identify areas with similar social vulnerability. The results consist of a series of maps of effective distance, outbreak probability, hospital capacity and social vulnerability. They show areas in the North and Northeast with high risk of COVID-19 outbreak that are also highly socially vulnerable. Later, these areas would be found the most severely affected. The maps produced were sent to health authorities to aid in their efforts to prioritize actions such as resource allocation to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. In the discussion, we address how predictions compared to the observed dynamics of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3087727357,"How ribosomes are made The formation of eukaryotic ribosomes is a complex process that starts with transcription of a large precursor RNA that assembles into a large 90S preribosome, which matures to finally give the 40S small subunit of the ribosome. Cheng et al. and Du et al. give insight into this process, using cryo–electron microscopy to look at intermediates along the pathway. Together, these studies reveal how a cast of molecular players act to coordinate the compositional and structural changes that transform the 90S preribosome into a pre-40S subunit.

https://openalex.org/W3087456655,"Purpose To examine the psychological impact of fertility treatment suspensions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to clarify psychosocial predictors of better or worse mental health. Methods 92 women from Canada and the United States (ages 20–45 years) whose fertility treatments had been cancelled were recruited via social media. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, perceived mental health impact, and change in quality of life related to treatment suspensions. Potential predictors of psychological outcomes were also examined, including several personality traits, aspects of social support, illness cognitions, and coping strategies. Results 52% of respondents endorsed clinical levels of depressive symptoms. On a 7-point scale, participants endorsed a significant decline in overall quality of life (M(SD) = -1.3(1.3), p < .0001) as well as a significant decline in mental health related to treatment suspensions on a scale from -5 to +5 (M(SD) = -2.1(2.1), p < .001). Several psychosocial variables were found to positively influence these outcomes: lower levels of defensive pessimism (r = -.25, p < .05), greater infertility acceptance (r = .51, p < .0001), better quality social support (r = .31, p < .01), more social support seeking (r = .35, p < .001) and less avoidance of infertility reminders (r = -.23, p = .029). Conclusion Fertility treatment suspensions have had a considerable negative impact on women’s mental health and quality of life. However, these findings point to several protective psychosocial factors that can be fostered in the future to help women cope."

Quantifying that heat increase is challenging because it requires many different temperature measurements over both the vertical and horizontal extent of the oceans. Wu et al. report success in this effort through the use of a different method: They inferred temperature changes from sound waves generated by repeating earthquakes (see the Perspective by Wunsch). The travel time of these earthquakes from source to receiver reflects changes in the average water temperature that they encounter. This technique should substantially enhance our ability to monitor ocean warming. Science , this issue p. 1510 ; see also p. 1433"
https://openalex.org/W3087350755,"Similar to many large river valleys globally, the Sacramento River Valley has been extensively drained and leveed, hydrologically divorcing river channels from most floodplains. Today, the former floodplain is extensively managed for agriculture. Lack of access to inundated floodplains is recognized as a significant contributing factor in the decline of native Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We observed differences in salmon growth rate, invertebrate density, and carbon source in food webs from three aquatic habitat types—leveed river channels, perennial drainage canals in the floodplain, and agricultural floodplain wetlands. Over 23 days (17 February to 11 March, 2016) food web structure and juvenile Chinook Salmon growth rates were studied within the three aquatic habitat types. Zooplankton densities on the floodplain wetland were 53x more abundant, on average, than in the river. Juvenile Chinook Salmon raised on the floodplain wetland grew at 0.92 mm/day, 5x faster than fish raised in the adjacent river habitat (0.18 mm/day). Two aquatic-ecosystem modeling methods were used to partition the sources of carbon (detrital or photosynthetic) within the different habitats. Both modeling approaches found that carbon in the floodplain wetland food web was sourced primarily from detrital sources through heterotrophic pathways, while carbon in the river was primarily photosynthetic and sourced from in situ autotrophic production. Hydrologic conditions typifying the ephemerally inundated floodplain—shallower depths, warmer water, longer water residence times and predominantly detrital carbon sources compared to deeper, colder, swifter water and a predominantly algal-based carbon source in the adjacent river channel—appear to facilitate the dramatically higher rates of food web production observed in the floodplain. These results suggest that hydrologic patterns associated with seasonal flooding facilitate river food webs to access floodplain carbon sources that contribute to highly productive heterotrophic energy pathways important to the production of fisheries resources."
https://openalex.org/W3087216867,"Wild boar and feral swine number and range are increasing worldwide in parallel with their impact on biodiversity and human activities. The ecological and economic impact of this species include spread of diseases, vehicle collisions, damage to crops, amenities and infrastructures and reduction in plant and animal abundance and richness. As traditional methods such as culling have not contained the growth and spread of wild boar and feral pigs, alternative methods such as fertility control are now advocated. We used empirical data on two isolated wild boar populations to model and compare the effects of different regimes of culling and fertility control on population trends. We built a Bayesian population model and applied it to explore the implications for population control of various management options combining culling and/or contraception. The results showed that, whilst fertility control on its own was not sufficient to achieve the target reduction in wild boar number, adding fertility control to culling was more effective than culling alone. In particular, using contraceptives on 40% of the population to complement the culling of 60% of the animals, halved the time to achieve our target reduction compared with culling only. We conclude that, assuming the effort of adding fertility control to culling was found to be cost-effective in terms of population reduction, these two methods should be used simultaneously if a rapid decrease in wild boar number is required for a closed population."
https://openalex.org/W3087130309,"Diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) techniques allow visualization of soft tissues of fluid-preserved specimens in three dimensions without dissection or histology. Two popular diceCT stains, iodine-potassium iodide (I2KI) dissolved in water and elemental iodine (I2) dissolved in 100% ethanol (EtOH), yield striking results. Despite the widespread use of these stains in clinical and biological fields, the molecular mechanisms that result in color change and radiopacity attributed to iodine staining are poorly understood. Requests to apply these stains to anatomical specimens preserved in natural history museums are increasing, yet curators have little information about the potential for degradation of treated specimens. To assess the molecular effects of iodine staining on typical museum specimens, we compared the two popular stains and two relatively unexplored stains (I2KI in 70% EtOH, I2 in 70% EtOH). House sparrows (Passer domesticus) were collected and preserved under uniform conditions following standard museum protocols, and each was then subjected to one of the stains. Results show that the three ethanol-based stains worked equally well (producing fully stained, life-like, publication quality scans) but in different timeframes (five, six, or eight weeks). The specimen in I2KI in water became degraded in physical condition, including developing flexible, demineralized bones. The ethanol-based methods also resulted in some demineralization but less than the water-based stain. The pH of the water-based stain was notably acidic compared to the water used as solvent in the stain. Our molecular analyses indicate that whereas none of the stains resulted in unacceptable levels of protein degradation, the bones of a specimen stained with I2KI in water demineralized throughout the staining process. We conclude that staining with I2KI or elemental I2 in 70% EtOH can yield high-quality soft-tissue visualization in a timeframe that is similar to that of better-known iodine-based stains, with lower risk of negative impacts on specimen condition."
https://openalex.org/W3087636632,"Clinical isolates of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) frequently contain mutations in the gene encoding an elongation factor, FusA1. Recent work has shown that fusA1 mutants often display elevated aminoglycoside resistance due to increased expression of the efflux pump, MexXY. However, we wondered whether these mutants might also be affected in other virulence-associated phenotypes. Here, we isolated a spontaneous gentamicin-resistant fusA1 mutant (FusA1P443L) in which mexXY expression was increased. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that the fusA1 mutant also exhibited discrete changes in the expression of key pathogenicity-associated genes. Most notably, the fusA1 mutant displayed greatly increased expression of the Type III secretion system (T3SS), widely considered to be the most potent virulence factor in the P. aeruginosa arsenal, and also elevated expression of the Type VI (T6) secretion machinery. This was unexpected because expression of the T3SS is usually reciprocally coordinated with T6 secretion system expression. The fusA1 mutant also displayed elevated exopolysaccharide production, dysregulated siderophore production, elevated ribosome synthesis, and transcriptomic signatures indicative of translational stress. Each of these phenotypes (and almost all of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with the fusA1 mutation) were restored to levels comparable with that in the progenitor strain by expression of the WT fusA1 gene in trans, indicating that the mutant gene is recessive. Our data show that in addition to elevating antibiotic resistance through mexXY expression (and also additional contributory resistance mechanisms), mutations in fusA1 can lead to highly selective dysregulation of virulence gene expression.

Due to its high intrinsic resistance to antibiotics and aggressive virulence, Pseudomonas aeruginosa holds the dubious accolade of consistently occupying a “top ten” slot on lists of clinical threats across the globe. Indeed, the World Health Organization recently classified it as a top priority pathogen for which the development of new antimicrobial interventions is critical. This opportunistic, Gram-negative bacterium is ubiquitous and exhibits a particular predilection for the built environment, making encounters with the human populace commonplace. P. aeruginosa is frequently isolated from burn wounds, the respiratory tract, and the urinary tract and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) (1McCarthy R.R.

CF is a genetic disease characterized by defective targeting or activity of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Although it is a multisystem disease affecting many organs, the most obvious manifestations of CF are associated with the respiratory tract. Here, defective mucociliary clearance causes an accumulation of thick mucus plugs within the airways. Such oxygen-limited environments provide the perfect niche for P. aeruginosa to thrive (4Ratjen F. Döring G. Cystic fibrosis.Lancet. 2003; 361 (12606185): 681-68910.1016/S0140-6736(03)12567-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 5Trinh N.T.N. Bilodeau C. Maillé É. Ruffin M.

Chronic P. aeruginosa infection of the CF lung is associated with the transition from an active, motile lifestyle to a sessile, biofilm-like mode of growth. These are bacterial communities embedded within a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix, composed of mannose-rich polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, and proteins (6Maunders E. Welch M. Matrix exopolysaccharides; the sticky side of biofilm formation.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2017; 364 (28605431): 3440-345210.1093/femsle/fnx120Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This matrix confers a level of protection against antibiotics and the host immune system (7Alhede M. Bjarnsholt T. Givskov M. Alhede M. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms.Adv. Appl.

Biofilm formation is also associated with increased expression of the Type VI (T6) secretion machinery.

Conversely, “free-swimming” planktonic cells predominate in acute infection scenarios. Here, virulence factors and motility are up-regulated, and pathogenicity is enhanced (10Breidenstein E.B.M. de la Fuente-Núñez C. Hancock R.E.W.

Perhaps the most potent P. aeruginosa virulence determinant is the Type III (T3) secretion system, which mediates the translocation of cytotoxic effector proteins directly into the cytoplasm of neighboring host cells. These effectors subvert the function of the recipient cells, typically by disrupting the cytoskeleton, promoting cell rounding and apoptosis, and therefore assist immune evasion through preventing phagocytosis by host innate immune cells (11Galle M. Carpentier I. Beyaert R. Structure and function of the Type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Curr. Protein Pept.

Both the T3 and T6 secretion systems are contact-triggered injectisomes; however, they are structurally and mechanistically distinct, as are their targets, and the expression of these two systems appears to be inversely correlated (13Moscoso J.A. Mikkelsen H. Heeb S. Williams P. Filloux A. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensor RetS switches type III and type VI secretion via c-di-GMP signalling.Environ. Microbiol. 2011; 13 (21955777): 3128-313810.1111/j.1462-2920.2011.02595.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In previous work, we showed that the rapidly growing planktonic cells associated with increased virulence factor production display markedly up-regulated expression of the machinery required for macromolecular synthesis, especially proteins involved in translation (14Mikkelsen H. Duck Z. Lilley K.S. Welch M. Interrelationships between colonies, biofilms, and planktonic cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189 (17220232): 2411-241610.1128/JB.01687-06Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Translation comprises four main steps; initiation, elongation, termination, and recycling. The ribosome-associated protein, elongation factor G (EF-G, encoded by fusA1 and fusA2 in P. aeruginosa), is essential for two of these steps: “elongation” and “recycling” (15Savelsbergh A. Rodnina M.V. Wintermeyer W. Distinct functions of elongation factor G in ribosome recycling and translocation.RNA. 2009; 15 (19324963): 772-78010.1261/rna.1592509Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). During elongation, EF-G catalyzes the translocation of charged tRNA from the A-site to the P-site and from the P-site to the E-site of the large ribosomal subunit. This is coupled with movement of the ribosome along the mRNA being translated. EF-G is comprised of five domains; domains I and II mediate GTP binding and hydrolysis, and domains III, IV, and V dock to the A-site of the ribosome. The tip of domain IV interacts with the mRNA and promotes tRNA translocation (16Salsi E. Farah E. Netter Z. Dann J. Ermolenko D.N. Movement of elongation factor G between compact and extended conformations.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427 (25463439): 454-46710.1016/j.jmb.2014.11.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This involves large structural rearrangements as the EF-G domains swivel relative to one another (17Belardinelli R. Rodnina V, M. Effect of fusidic acid on the kinetics of molecular motions during EF-G-induced translocation on the ribosome.Sci.

The translocation process is repeated until a stop codon is encountered and release factors catalyze hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA bond, thereby liberating the newly synthesized polypeptide. EF-G then coordinates with ribosome-recycling factor (a structural mimic of tRNA) to promote disassembly of the ribosomal subunits (16Salsi E. Farah E. Netter Z. Dann J. Ermolenko D.N. Movement of elongation factor G between compact and extended conformations.J. Mol.

Microbiol. 2014; 12 (24336183): 35-4810.1038/nrmicro3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Aminoglycoside antibiotics can disrupt both the elongation and recycling steps, thereby leading to a decrease in the overall number of ribosomes available. Whole-genome sequence analyses have revealed that fusA1 is a hotspot for accruing mutations in P. aeruginosa isolates from patients with CF (20Bolard A. Plésiat P. Jeannot K. Mutations in gene fusA1 as a novel mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance in clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2018; 62 (29133559): e01817-e0183510.1128/aac.01835-17Crossref Google Scholar). These fusA1 mutants often display increased resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. However, little more is known about the phenotypic consequences of such fusA1 mutations on the wider physiology of the cell. In this study, we show that a spontaneous SNP in P. aeruginosa fusA1 gives rise to discrete but large-magnitude changes in key pathophysiological processes. For example, the strain containing the mutated fusA1 allele displayed selective up-regulation of genes encoding the T3 secretion system (T3SS) apparatus, the T6 secretion system (T6SS) apparatus, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes, and a multidrug efflux system. These findings suggest a hitherto unexpected subtlety in the chain of events linking transcription, translation, and virulence/antibiotic sensitivity in this organism. At the outset of this investigation, we sought to identify potential regulators of biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. To do this, we made a stable chromosomal reporter construct in which the promoter of the cdrAB operon (PcdrAB) was fused to a promoter-less lacZ ORF. CdrA is a biofilm-associated extracellular matrix adhesion and is known to be primarily expressed in conditions that favor biofilm formation. The construct was integrated at a neutral site in the PAO1 chromosome using the mini-CTX system (21Calvo B. Bilbao J.R. Pérez De Nanclares G. Vázquez J.A. Castaño L. Integration-proficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa vectors for isolation of single-copy chromosomal lacZ lux gene fusions.BioTechniques. 2000; 29 (11084852): 948-95410.2144/00295bm04Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The resulting PcdrAB::lacZ reporter strain, hereafter referred to as EMC0, yielded vivid blue colonies when grown on M9 minimal medium agar plates containing X-Gal and glucose, but far paler colonies on medium containing X-Gal and glycerol. This suggested that PcdrAB is activated during colony growth on glucose. To identify genes that might impinge upon transcription from the cdrAB promoter, we mutagenized EMC0 by introducing the pTnMod-OGm plasposon (22Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Plasposons: modular self-cloning minitransposon derivatives for rapid genetic analysis of Gram-negative bacterial genomes.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64 (9647854): 2710-271510.1128/AEM.64.7.2710-2715.1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting mutants were selected on plates containing gentamicin (to select for likely Tn insertion mutants) and X-Gal + glucose (to establish whether any of the mutants were affected in transcription from PcdrAB). Around 10,000 gentamicin-resistant mutants were screened in all. Several of these yielded a paler pigmentation than EMC0 when grown on X-Gal/glucose plates, indicating a reduction in transcription from PcdrAB (Fig. 1A). Further analysis of one of these isolates (hereafter denoted EMC1) in M9-glucose liquid cultures confirmed the diminished β-gal production. This also indicated that EMC1 had a minor growth defect in this medium (Fig. 1A). We therefore measured growth and β-gal production in a rich medium, LB. To our surprise, EMC1 exhibited an even greater growth defect in this medium (Fig. 1B). Attempts to identify the insertion site of the plasposon in EMC1 using conventional approaches (including “random-primed” PCR-based amplification of the regions flanking the plasposon, or “cloning out” of the plasposon as described previously (22Dennis J.J. Zylstra G.J. Plasposons: modular self-cloning minitransposon derivatives for rapid genetic analysis of Gram-negative bacterial genomes.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64 (9647854): 2710-271510.1128/AEM.64.7.2710-2715.1998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) failed. We therefore used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of EMC1 (and, as a control, also of the EMC0 progenitor strain) to identify the plasposon insertion site. Remarkably, and despite the robust GmR phenotype of the strain (Table 1), we found that EMC1 did not contain a plasposon insertion. It did, however, contain a C→T transition at position 4,770,363 in the genome (Fig. S1). This SNP was located in the fusA1 ORF and resulted in a proline-to-leucine substitution at position 443 in the protein. The SNP was confirmed by PCR amplification of the gene followed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product. WGS also revealed a selection of additional potential SNPs in EMC1, but these were all subsequently found by PCR/Sanger sequencing to be false positive SNP calls arising from the WGS technology. We conclude that the only difference between EMC0 and EMC1 is the SNP in fusA1.Table 1MICs of antibiotics for EMC0 and EMC1AntibioticMode of actionEMC0 MICEMC1 MICμg/mlGentamicinBinds 30S ribosome and disrupts reading of tRNA210KanamycinBinds 30S ribosome and disrupts reading of tRNA1500>2000TetracyclineBinds 30S ribosome and inhibits binding of tRNA2020ChloramphenicolBinds 50S ribosome and inhibits peptide bond formation250250RifampicinInhibits RNA polymerase100100Fusidic acidInhibits elongation factor G17501750 Open table in a new tab The gentamicin resistance of EMC1 was heritable but could be somewhat unstable. In one experiment, progressive subculturing (via 1:100 dilution of the culture into fresh medium every 24 h) of EMC1 in M9-glucose minimal medium lacking gentamicin gave rise to gentamicin-sensitive (GmS) derivatives. After each 24-h round of subculturing, aliquots were removed, serially diluted, and plated onto nonselective M9-glucose agar. A selection of 40 colonies from these plates were then retested for gentamicin resistance by plating onto M9-glucose + Gm. Following the first round of subculturing (24-h growth), none of the 40 tested colonies were GmS. However, after the second round of subculturing (a cumulative 48 h of growth) 1 of 40 colonies tested was gentamicin-sensitive, rising to 5 of 40 colonies after the third 24-h round of subculturing. PCR amplification and sequencing of the fusA1 gene in these GmS derivatives revealed that they all still contained the fusA1P443L mutation. These data suggest that whatever gives rise to the GmR phenotype in EMC1 can be overridden by secondary mutations elsewhere. However, these bypass mutations do not arise with high frequency, and even when they did, they took time to spread through the culture (with only 1 in 8 of the isolates sampled being GmS after 72 h of growth). Indeed, subsequent independent repeats of the experiment yielded no further GmS isolates upon subculturing EMC1 in the absence of gentamicin. FusA1 encodes one of the two paralogous EF-G proteins in P. aeruginosa and plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis and ribosomal recycling (23Palmer S.O. Rangel E.Y. Hu Y. Tran A.T. Bullard J.M. Two homologous EF-G proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit distinct functions.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (24260360): e8025210.1371/journal.pone.0080252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the two paralogues (denoted fusA1 (PA4266) and fusA2 (PA2071)) is highly conserved, with a shared identity of 84%. EF-G1B, encoded by fusA2, is thought to have greater involvement in elongation and polypeptide synthesis (23Palmer S.O. Rangel E.Y. Hu Y. Tran A.T. Bullard J.M. Two homologous EF-G proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit distinct functions.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (24260360): e8025210.1371/journal.pone.0080252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). By contrast, EF-G1A (encoded by fusA1) has a more dominant role in ribosomal recycling and association with ribosomal recycling factors (23Palmer S.O. Rangel E.Y. Hu Y. Tran A.T. Bullard J.M. Two homologous EF-G proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit distinct functions.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (24260360): e8025210.1371/journal.pone.0080252Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FusA1 is a conformationally flexible multidomain protein (24Lin J. Gagnon M.G. Bulkley D. Steitz T.A. Conformational changes of elongation factor G on the ribosome during tRNA translocation.Cell. 2015; 160 (25594181): 219-22710.1016/j.cell.2014.11.049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and proline 443 sits in close proximity to the crucial GTPase “switch” regions (Fig. 2A). The switch regions play an important role in directing GDP-GTP exchange, raising the question of whether the P443L substitution might affect the conformation of the protein. To test this, we measured the intrinsic Trp fluorescence profile of purified WT FusA1 and FusA1P443L. FusA1 contains 6 tryptophan residues. Protein Trp fluorescence is exquisitely sensitive to the microenvironment of each Trp residue and, as such, can be a sensitive reporter of protein conformation. These analyses indicated that purified FusA1P443L had a lower quantum yield at the Trp emission λmax (332 nm) compared with the WT protein (Fig. 2B). This indicates that one or more Trp residues in the mutant protein are likely to exhibit altered solvent accessibility compared with the WT protein, possibly due to conformational differences. One of the more widely used web-based algorithms, mCSM (25Pires D.E.V. Ascher D.B. Blundell T.L. mCSM: predicting the effects of mutations in proteins using graph-based signatures.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30 (24281696): 335-34210.1093/bioinformatics/btt691Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), predicted that the P443L substitution should destabilize FusA1 by 0.267 kcal/mol. Consistent with this, purified FusA1P443L had a lower melting temperature than the WT protein (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that the P443L substitution likely alters the conformation, stability, or dynamics of FusA1. The substantial growth defect associated with EMC1 grown in LB was complementable by expression of the WT fusA1 gene in trans on a plasmid (Fig. S2), suggesting that the WT allele is dominant. The complemented EMC1 also displayed the same MIC for gentamicin as EMC0. Compared with EMC0, EMC1 also exhibited defects in twitching motility and swimming motility, and these too could be complemented by introduction of WT fusA1 in trans (Fig. 3A). EMC1 also displayed lower secreted gelatinase activity, and poor growth on the gelatinase plates. However, the lower secreted gelatinase production and slower growth of EMC1 may be linked because complementation of EMC1 in trans with WT fusA1 restored both phenotypes. Expression of fusA1P443L in trans in EMC0 or EMC1 had no apparent effect on the motility/gelatinase phenotypes of the strains compared with the empty vector control. This suggests that the WT fusA1 allele in EMC0 is dominant. By contrast with the impaired motility and secreted protease phenotypes, exopolysaccharide production was increased in EMC1 compared with EMC0, both on plate assays (Fig. 3A) and in liquid culture (Fig. S3). Expression of WT fusA1 in trans in EMC1 led to a decrease in exopolysaccharide production (compared with EMC1 containing the empty vector control), whereas expression of fusA1P443L enhanced exopolysaccharide synthesis. Exopolysaccharides comprise the extracellular matrix, which “glues together” cells in a biofilm. Interestingly in this regard, the increased exopolysaccharide production in EMC1 was not accompanied by an increase in its biofilm-forming ability compared with EMC0 (data not shown). Exopolysaccharide production is often inversely correlated with expression of the T3 secretion machinery. We therefore examined whether the P443L substitution in FusA1 impacted T3 secretion. To our surprise, cultures of EMC1 overexpressed the T3SS protein, PcrV (Fig. 3B). This increased expression was due to increased transcription of the pcrV-encoding operon, because RT-PCR analyses indicated that the amount of mRNA encoding pcrV was also increased in EMC1 (Fig. 3B and Fig. S4). This increased expression of PcrV could be reversed by supplying WT fusA1 in trans. These observations led us to test whether previously reported GmR fusA1 point mutants also displayed increased PcrV expression. A selection of GmR fusA1 mutants (all in a PAO1 genetic background) recently reported by Bolard et al. (20Bolard A. Plésiat P. Jeannot K. Mutations in gene fusA1 as a novel mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance in clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2018; 62 (29133559): e01817-e0183510.1128/aac.01835-17Crossref Google Scholar) were grown (alongside the progenitor PAO1 strain from that study) in M9-glucose, and the corresponding cell extracts were probed after SDS-PAGE resolution with anti-PcrV antibodies. None of these mutants displayed the robust PcrV expression associated with EMC1 (Fig. S5). This suggests that the GmR phenotype conferred by these other mutated fusA1 proteins is not linked with PcrV expression. Given that multiple phenotypes were affected by the fusA1P443L mutation in EMC1 and that these phenotypes were not all modulated in the manner expected from previous studies (e.g. exopolysaccharide production and T3 secretion both being up-regulated instead of inversely regulated), this suggested that the P443L mutation may lead to global dysregulation in EMC1. To investigate this further, cultures of EMC0, EMC1, and EMC1 complemented with WT fusA1 expressed from pUCP20 in trans (hereafter EMC1*) were grown to late exponential phase in M9 minimal medium + glucose and were prepared for iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis. To establish whether any of the observed changes in protein profile were also underpinned by transcriptional changes, samples were also harvested for RNA sequencing (from cultures grown in the same conditions). The proteomic analysis resolved 3506 proteins (of a total of 5570 predicted ORFs encoded by P. aeruginosa PAO1). Principal components analysis of the data revealed that the proteome of EMC1 was distinct from that of EMC0 and that the proteomic changes giving rise to this segregation could be largely reversed by expression of WT fusA1 in trans in EMC1* (Fig. S6 (A–C) and Tables S1 and S2). Proteins were considered to be significantly modulated if they exhibited a log2-fold change (FC) > 1 (or < −1, if down-regulated) with a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p value of ≤0.01. Based on these criteria, 128 proteins were up-regulated in EMC1 compared with EMC0, and 166 proteins were down-regulated. The 20 most highly up-regulated proteins are shown in Table 2. Remarkably, and consistent with the earlier phenotypic analyses, over half (12 of 20) of these proteins were involved in T3 secretion. Similarly, and also consistent with our earlier observations, PelA, involved in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharide, was also up-regulated. A list of the top 20 down-regulated proteins is shown in Table 2. The situation here is more ambiguous, because the majority (13 of 20) of these proteins currently have no assigned function.Table 2List of the top 20 proteins (based on log2FC) modulated in EMC1 versus EMC0ProteinLocus tagProtein functionEMC1 versus EMC0log2FCp valueUp-regulated proteins 1PscLPA1725Type III secretion export protein5.8730.000 2PopNPA1698Type III secretion outer membrane protein4.1870.001 3PscPPA1695Type III secretion translocation protein4.1780.000 4PA3661Hypothetical protein4.0040.002 5PopDPA1709Type III secretion outer membrane protein3.8950.000 6PA1325Hypothetical protein3.6670.000 7ExoYPA2191Adenylate cyclase3.2660.000 8SpcSPA3842ExoS chaperone3.2630.000 9PcrHPA1707Regulatory protein3.2620.000 10ExoSPA3841Exoenzyme S3.2610.000 11PcrGPA1705Type III secretion regulator3.2110.000 12PopBPA1708Type III translocator protein3.1510.000 13ExoTPA0044Exoenzyme T2.8360.000 14AprXPA1245Metalloproteinase2.7980.001 15AprAPA1249Alkaline metalloproteinase2.7550.007 16PelAPA3064Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis2.7250.000 17PA0630Hypothetical protein2.6880.001 18PA0620R-type pyocin, related to P2 phage2.6130.000 19SsuDPA3444Hypothetical protein2.5190.002 20PscFPA1719Type III export protein2.5070.000Down-regulated proteins 1ExaBPA1983Ethanol oxidation−3.1540.000 2PA5086Predicted T6SS lipase immunity protein−3.0880.000 3PA2565Hypothetical protein−2.9620.002 4PA3865Probable amino acid–binding protein−2.9550.001 5PA3785Hypothetical protein−2"
https://openalex.org/W3087018131,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a complex condition comprising a 'clustering' of components representing cardiometabolic risk factors for heart disease and diabetes; its prevalence rate is high and consequences serious. Evidence suggests that light exposure patterns and misalignment of circadian rhythms might contribute to MetS etiology by impacting energy metabolism and glucose regulation.We hypothesised that individuals with MetS would show disrupted circadian and sleep parameters alongside differences in light exposure profiles. We investigated this using data from a cohort study in Brazil.Data from 103 individuals from the Baependi Heart Cohort Study aged between 50 and 70 were analysed. Motor activity and light exposure were measured using wrist-worn actigraphy devices. Cardiometabolic data were used to calculate the number of MetS components present in each participant, and participants grouped as MetS/non-MetS according to standard guidelines. Between-group comparisons were made for the actigraphy measures; additionally, correlation analyses were conducted.Motor activity and circadian profiles showed no differences between groups. However, the MetS group presented lower light exposure during the day and higher light exposure at night. Correlation analyses, including all participants, showed that greater daytime light exposure and greater light exposure difference between day and night were associated with reduced MetS risk (a lower number of MetS components). Also, the light exposure difference between day and night correlated with body mass index across all participants.The observed results suggest a direct association between light exposure and MetS which appears to not be attributable to disruptions in circadian activity rhythm nor to sleep parameters. This link between light exposure patterns and MetS risk could inform possible prevention strategies."

Two experiments were designed as a 2 x 3 replicated incomplete Latin square design. Eight cats, with an average body weight (BW) of 4.34 kg ± 0.04 and body condition score (BCS) of 5.4 ± 1.4 (9 point scale), were fed isocaloric amounts of a commercial adult maintenance canned cat food either once (0800 h) or four times daily (0800 h, 1130 h, 1500 h, 1830 h). Study 1 consisted of three 21-d periods. On day 14, two fasted and 11 postprandial blood samples were collected over 24 hours to measure plasma concentrations of ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP, leptin, PYY, insulin and amino acids, and whole blood glucose. Physical activity was monitored from day 15 to 21 of each period. In Study 2 indirect calorimetry was performed on the last day of each period. Body weight was measured weekly and feed intake recorded daily in both experiments. No effect of feeding regimen on BW was detected. Cats eating four times daily had lesser plasma concentrations of GIP and GLP-1 (P<0.05) and tended to have lesser plasma PYY concentrations (P<0.1). Plasma leptin and whole blood glucose concentrations did not differ between regimens (P>0.1). Cats fed once daily had a greater postprandial plasma amino acid response, and greater plasma ghrelin and insulin concentrations (P<0.05). Physical activity was greater in cats fed four times (P<0.05), though energy expenditure was similar between treatments at fasting and in postprandial phases. Finally, cats eating one meal had a lower fasting respiratory quotient (P<0.05). Overall, these data indicate that feeding once a day may be a beneficial feeding management strategy for indoor cats to promote satiation and lean body mass."

In addition to the originator pharmaceutical company, Janssen, a range of governmental and non-profit entities have contributed to the development of bedaquiline. Materials and methods We identified various avenues of public investments in the development of bedaquiline: direct funding of clinical trials and a donation programme, tax credits and deductions, and revenues resulting from the priority review voucher (PRV) awarded to the originator. Data on investments were gathered through contact with study leads and/or funders; for non-responses, published average costs were substituted. The originator company’s expenses were estimated by similar methods. Tax credits and deductions were calculated based on estimated originator trial costs and donation expenses. The value of the PRV was estimated by application of a published model. Results Public contributions through clinical trials funding were estimated at US$109–252 million, tax credits at US$22–36 million, tax deductions at US$8–27 million, administration of a donation programme at US$5 million, PRV revenues at US$300–400 million. Total public investments were US$455–747 million and originator investments were US$90–240 million (if capitalized and risk-adjusted, US$647–1,201 million and US$292–772 million, respectively). Conclusions Estimating the investments in the development of a medicine can inform discussions regarding fair pricing and future drug development. We estimated that total public investments exceeded the originator’s by a factor of 1.6–5.1."
https://openalex.org/W3087327384,"The incidence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic diseases has reached an epidemic status worldwide. Insulin resistance is a common link in the development of these conditions, and hyperinsulinemia is a central hallmark of peripheral insulin resistance. However, how hyperinsulinemia leads to systemic insulin resistance is less clear. We now provide evidence that hyperinsulinemia promotes the release of soluble pro-inflammatory mediators from macrophages that lead to systemic insulin resistance. Our observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia induces sirtuin1 (SIRT1) repression and stimulates NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and transactivation of NF-κB to promote the extracellular release of pro-inflammatory mediators. We further showed that low-dose naltrexone (LDN) abrogates hyperinsulinemia-mediated SIRT1 repression and prevents NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. This, in turn, attenuates the hyperinsulinemia-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reinstates insulin sensitivity both in in vitro and in vivo diet-induced hyperinsulinemic mouse model. Notably, our data indicate that Sirt1 knockdown or inhibition blunts the anti-inflammatory properties of LDN in vitro. Using numerous complementary in silico and in vitro experimental approaches, we demonstrated that LDN can bind to SIRT1 and increase its deacetylase activity. Together, these data support a critical role of SIRT1 in inflammation and insulin resistance in hyperinsulinemia. LDN improves hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance by reorienting macrophages toward anti-inflammation. Thus, LDN treatment may provide a novel therapeutic approach against hyperinsulinemia-associated insulin resistance.

The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is initially characterized by decreased insulin sensitivity, manifested by ensuing hyperglycemia and a compensatory response where pancreatic β-cells produce and secrete more insulin, and subsequently results in hyperinsulinemia (2Kahn S.E.

Recently, naltrexone has gained a remarkable intervention in various neurological and autoimmune pathological conditions (14Toljan K. Vrooman B.

Naltrexone was synthesized as an orally active competitive opioid receptor antagonist; however, LDN exhibits paradoxical properties, including analgesia and anti-inflammatory actions (16Younger J.

LDN simultaneously has an antagonistic effect on nonopioid receptors, including TLR4, that have not been reported at higher doses (16Younger J. Parkitny L. McLain D.

Because insulin resistance is associated with a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, we sought to determine the role of LDN in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance associated with hyperinsulinemia in this study. Here, using numerous complementary experimental approaches, we show the critical participation of SIRT1 in inflammation and insulin resistance associated with hyperinsulinemia. Our findings indicate that LDN rescues hyperinsulinemia-induced insulin resistance by attenuating NF-κB activity and blocking the release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Together, these data indicate that LDN improves insulin sensitivity by reorienting the macrophages toward anti-inflammation and that LDN may be used against insulin resistance, inflammation, and associated metabolic diseases. We developed a short-term HFD-fed nonobese mouse model (Fig. 1A) to provide a deeper understanding of endogenous mechanisms that regulate insulin action in response to circulating hyperinsulinemia and study the effect of LDN on the insulin signaling axis in diet-induced hyperinsulinemic mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, fasting serum insulin levels were higher in the HFD saline fed mice than in the normal chow diet (NCD) fed mice, indicating the development of hyperinsulinemic mice. Interestingly, fasting insulin levels decreased significantly after LDN treatment in the HFD group. Dynamic insulin tolerance tests (ipITT) and glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT) were carried out to measure the peripheral response to insulin and glucose, respectively, and to explore the in vivo efficacy of LDN on glucose homeostasis and whole-body insulin sensitivity. HFD-fed hyperinsulinemic mice displayed impaired insulin sensitivity (as evident by the higher area under the curve), compared with the NCD groups, and the insulin sensitivity returned to normal when HFD-fed mice were treated with LDN (Fig. 1C). A similar trend was observed for ipGTT, as the HFD-saline group exhibited an increased glucose excursion AUC, compared with mice on NCD, and it was significantly reduced in HFD-LDN mice (Fig. 1D). Overall, we found that HFD-LDN mice were substantially more glucose tolerant than the HFD-saline group, and it had reduced basal insulin levels suggesting improved insulin sensitivity. Together, these findings indicate the potential new role of LDN in improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in HFD-induced hyperinsulinemic mice. Basal hyperinsulinemia is closely linked to pro-inflammatory conditions that lead to insulin resistance (20Kappert K. Meyborg H. Clemenz M. Graf K. Fleck E. Kintscher U. Stawowy P. Insulin facilitates monocyte migration: A possible link to tissue inflammation in insulin-resistance.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365 (17999918): 503-50810.1016/j.bbrc.2007.11.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Next, we tested the possible involvement of hyperinsulinemia in inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and we determined the effects of LDN on the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in an HFD mouse model. Serum from HFD-induced hyperinsulinemic mice showed a significantly enhanced release of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6. Interestingly, we found that LDN treatment attenuated hyperinsulinemia-induced serum IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 levels (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that diet-induced hyperinsulinemia resulted in the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators and LDN treatment significantly abrogates hyperinsulinemia-induced release of pro-inflammatory mediators in serum. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are closely linked to an inflammatory condition that leads to insulin resistance (7Blüher M. Clinical relevance of adipokines.Diabetes Metab. J. 2012; 36 (23130315): 317-32710.4093/dmj.2012.36.5.317Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Increased accumulation of pro-inflammatory or classically activated M1 macrophages in adipose tissue is positively correlated with insulin resistance (21Surmi B.K. Hasty A.H. Macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue: Initiation, propagation and remodeling.Future Lipidol. 2008; 3 (18978945): 545-55610.2217/17460875.3.5.545Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of HFD-induced hyperinsulinemia on cytokine expression in purified ATMs. Expression of pro-inflammatory markers, such as IL-1β, MCP-1, and CD11c, was induced (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1) in the HFD-saline group, but LDN treatment attenuated the expression profile of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine that was induced by hyperinsulinemia and restored anti-inflammatory cytokine expression (Fig. S1). Taken together, these findings suggest that LDN inhibits hyperinsulinemia-induced inflammation. Next, we tested the possible involvement of hyperinsulinemia-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance by investigating the effect of hyperinsulinemia on macrophage cells. We challenged macrophage cells with a high dose of insulin (100 nm) for 24 h in the presence and absence of LDN (nontoxic low dose) and analyzed various parameters as discussed below (Fig. 2A). A nontoxic dose of LDN (5 μm) was selected for in vitro studies (Fig. S2). Our study revealed that a high dose of insulin induced an M1-like phenotype by elevating the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL-1β, MCP-1, and CD11C) and LDN attenuated insulin-mediated M1 (IL-1β, MCP-1, and CD11C) cytokine mRNA expression (Fig. 2B and Fig. S3). Furthermore, we analyzed conditioned media proteins released from macrophages when challenged with high insulin in the presence and absence of LDN. Our results (Fig. 2C) showed a significant increase in IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 release in conditioned media from insulin-challenged macrophage cells, which was attenuated by LDN treatment. To decipher hyperinsulinemia-induced aberrant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the development of insulin resistance, HepG2 cells were exposed to hyperinsulinemia-treated Raw 264.7 cell-conditioned media, and its downstream effects were analyzed. Phosphorylation of AKT (Ser-473), AKT (Thr-308), and GSK3β (Ser-9) were measured as a surrogate for insulin resistance. Interestingly, we found that conditioned media from hyperinsulinemia-treated macrophage cells blunted the phosphorylation of AKT (Ser-473), AKT (Thr-308), and GSK3β (Ser-9), compared with the conditioned media from non–insulin-treated macrophage cells, whereas conditioned media from the LDN-treated hyperinsulinemic group retained AKT (Ser-473), AKT (Thr-308), and GSK3β (Ser-9) phosphorylation (Fig. 2, D–G). Naltrexone has a t1/2 of 4–10 h (14Toljan K. Vrooman B. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN)—review of therapeutic utilization.Med. Sci. 2018; 6 (30248938): 8210.3390/medsci6040082Google Scholar), which excludes the possibility that the presence of naltrexone in conditioned media (after 24-h treatment) interferes with insulin sensitivity. To delineate whether cytokines released by macrophages, or any other soluble factors, are responsible for inhibition of phosphorylation, we treated HepG2 cells with hyperinsulinemia-challenged macrophage-conditioned media after heat inactivation (Fig. 2A) and found that heat inactivation of conditioned media did not blunt AKT (Ser-473) phosphorylation in HepG2 cells (Fig. S4). Together, these findings suggest that hyperinsulinemia induces the release of various pro-inflammatory mediators that are involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and that LDN attenuated the hyperinsulinemia-mediated release of pro-inflammatory mediators and restored insulin sensitivity. NF-κB is a key transcription factor that drives the pro-inflammatory phenotype. It is held quiescent in the cytoplasm in a complex with IκBα (22Cohen L. Henzel W.J. Baeuerle P.A. IKAP is a scaffold protein of the IκB kinase complex.Nature. 1998; 395 (9751059): 292-29610.1038/26254Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In response to pro-inflammatory stimuli via TLR, IκBα is phosphorylated, thereby allowing NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and activate the transcription of a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to induce inflammatory responses (23Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israël A. Complementation cloning of NEMO, a component of the IκB kinase complex essential for NF-κB activation.Cell. 1998; 93 (9657155): 1231-124010.1016/S0092-8674(00)81466-XAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). To investigate whether NF-κB transcription was regulated by hyperinsulinemia treatment, a construct containing a luciferase enzyme driven by an NF-κB promoter was transfected into macrophage cells. We observed that hyperinsulinemia increased the transactivation potential of NF-κB, and LDN prevented such transactivation (Fig. 3A). NF-κB activation also relies on posttranslational modifications of NF-κB subunits, such as RelA (p65) phosphorylation (24Viatour P. Merville M.-P. Bours V. Chariot A. Phosphorylation of NF-κB and IκB proteins: Implications in cancer and inflammation.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30 (15653325): 43-5210.1016/j.tibs.2004.11.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). In addition to the increased transactivation potential of NF-κB, an elevated level of p65 phosphorylation was also observed in hyperinsulinemic treatment compared with untreated cells, which were attenuated in the presence of LDN (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of the p65 subunit is required for the optimal p65-mediated transactivation potential of NF-κB. Next, we examined NF-κB p65 subcellular localization, which was barely detectable in the nucleus of unstimulated macrophage cells. As expected, hyperinsulinemia increased nuclear NF-κB p65 localization, whereas LDN treatment blocked this shuttling of NF-κB to the nucleus from the cytosol (Fig. 3C). We also performed a Western blot analysis of liver nuclear extracts from experimental mice to determine the relative amount of NF-κB p65. Western blotting data showed increased nuclear NF-κB p65 in HFD-saline livers as compared with other experimental groups (Fig. 3, D and E). Taken together, these results suggest that NF-κB p65 is translocated into the nucleus in response to high insulin conditions, whereas LDN prevents NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and blocks the hyperinsulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p65 subunit, which is required for optimal p65-mediated transactivation. SIRT1 is known to be a positive regulator of insulin signaling, and several studies have indicated the involvement of SIRT1 in insulin resistance and T2DM (25Li Y. Xu S. Giles A. Nakamura K. Lee J.W. Hou X. Donmez G. Li J. Luo Z. Walsh K. Guarente L. Zang M. Hepatic overexpression of SIRT1 in mice attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance in the liver.FASEB J. 2011; 25 (21321189): 1664-167910.1096/fj.10-173492Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). SIRT1 activity and/or expression is reported to be down-regulated in different metabolically sensitive organs in diabetic and insulin-resistant rodent models (25Li Y. Xu S. Giles A. Nakamura K. Lee J.W. Hou X. Donmez G. Li J. Luo Z. Walsh K. Guarente L. Zang M. Hepatic overexpression of SIRT1 in mice attenuates endoplasmic reticulum stress and insulin resistance in the liver.FASEB J. 2011; 25 (21321189): 1664-167910.1096/fj.10-173492Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of hyperinsulin and/or LDN on SIRT1, we measured the SIRT1 protein expression profile in hyperinsulinemic state in the liver, white adipose tissue lysates from NCD and HFD mice, and hyperinsulinemia-challenged macrophage cells in the presence and absence of LDN treatment. Interestingly, we observed that in the HFD-saline group, basal hyperinsulinemia resulted in significant repression of nuclear SIRT1 levels in the liver, whereas LDN treatment protected SIRT1 from such down-regulation (Fig. 3, D and F). Similar to liver tissue lysates, white adipose tissue lysates showed markedly reduced adipose nuclear SIRT1 levels in HFD-fed mice (with basal hyperinsulinemia), compared with the NCD group (Fig. S5). Interestingly, we observed that hyperinsulinemia significantly down-regulated SIRT1 protein levels in macrophages, whereas LDN treatment protected SIRT1 from such down-regulation (Fig. 3G). We found that protein levels of endogenous SIRT1 decreased in hyperinsulinemic conditions, and conversely, LDN treatment maintained SIRT1 levels even under hyperinsulinemic conditions, which suggests that LDN may influence SIRT1 protein stability. To test this idea, endogenous SIRT1 protein levels were measured by time after inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX). As shown in Fig. 3, levels of SIRT1 were reduced upon CHX treatment in the presence of insulin for 12 h (Fig. 3, H and I). Interestingly, although LDN treatment stabilized SIRT1 levels under insulin-treated conditions (Fig. 3, H and I), the SIRT1 mRNA levels did not significantly change under these conditions (Fig. S6). Together, these results clearly illustrate that hyperinsulinemia-mediated SIRT1 degradation is abrogated in the presence of LDN. To evaluate whether SIRT1 participates in regulating LDN-mediated attenuation of NF-κB activity, thereby down-regulating pro-inflammatory responses, we knocked down SIRT1 using murine sequence-specific siRNA in cultured mouse macrophage cells. Knockdown was specific, as shown on the immunoblot with an ∼90% reduction of SIRT1 (Fig. S7). Macrophage cells were transfected with an NF-κB/luciferase reporter construct and were treated with high insulin and LDN in the presence and absence of Sirt1 specific inhibitor (EX-527) or siRNA for Sirt1 and Sirt1 overexpression (SIRT1 O.E.). NF-κB transactivity showed a 2.5-fold increase when cells were treated with insulin as measured by luciferase assay (Fig. 3J), whereas, LDN and Sirt1 overexpression significantly attenuated hyperinsulinemia-induced NF-κB activity. Interestingly, LDN-mediated suppression of NF-κB promoter activity was absent when the cells were treated with EX-527 (Fig. 3J). Similar to Ex-527, in Sirt1 knockdown cells, the absence of Sirt1 significantly increased NF-κB promoter activity even in the presence of LDN (Fig. 3J). Similarly, to determine the role of Sirt1 in determining LDN efficacy, we treated macrophages with insulin in the presence and absence of LDN for 24 h and also with or without Sirt1 knockdown. Interestingly, we found that hyperinsulinemia increased NF-κB p65 nuclear localization, which was prevented by LDN; however, LDN was unable to attenuate NF-κB p65 nuclear localization when Sirt1 was silenced using Sirt1 siRNA (Fig. 3K). These observations indicate that Sirt1 is required for LDN to block hyperinsulin-stimulated nuclear localization of NF-κB p65 subunit and transactivation potential of NF-κB. To further characterize the potential role of SIRT1 in regulating LDN-mediated attenuation of pro-inflammatory gene expression, macrophage cells were treated with high insulin and LDN in the presence and absence of EX-527, siRNA specific for Sirt1, and analyzed for pro-inflammatory gene expression. As shown in Fig. S8, cells co-treated with LDN and EX-527 showed no change in pro-inflammatory gene expression profile as compared with the high insulin-treated group. Furthermore, macrophage cells with knocked down Sirt1 also abrogated the anti-inflammatory effect of LDN. Taken together, these results indicate that LDN specifically blocks hyperinsulin-stimulated nuclear localization of NF-κB p65, which is required for optimal p65-mediated transactivation potential of NF-κB and the LDN-stimulated anti-inflammatory phenotype depends on SIRT1. We performed a blind docking experiment to investigate the possibility of naltrexone interactions with SIRT1. The docked complex of naltrexone binds to the main active site of SIRT1 with low binding energy of −10.94 kcal. The negative binding energy shows the spontaneous binding of naltrexone at the active site of SIRT1. The possibility of naltrexone binding at some other additional binding sites was also detected, but its minimum energy cluster showed the highest binding affinity for the main active site. Although no hydrogen bonding interaction was detected between naltrexone-SIRT1, the nearby close contact residues involved in hydrophobic interactions are Ala-262, Ser-265, Ile-270, Pro-271, Asp-272, Gln-345, Asn-346, Ile-347, and Asp-348 (Fig. 4, A and B). These close contact residues are responsible for holding naltrexone at the active site of SIRT1. To determine the interaction between SIRT1 and naltrexone and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the naltrexone-SIRT1 complex, a series of microscale thermophoresis experiment measurements were recorded for fixed amounts of SIRT1 with an increasing amount of naltrexone. An S-shaped sigmoidal binding curve was obtained in the presence of the naltrexone-SIRT1 complex. From the experimental data, it was determined that the Kd = 77.5 nm for SIRT1 (Fig. 4C). This observation suggests a significant binding affinity between SIRT1 and naltrexone. Furthermore, SIRT1 deacetylase activity was evaluated using a deacetylase fluorometric assay kit (CS1040, Sigma-Aldrich). LDN treatment showed significantly higher SIRT1 deacetylase activity than the control (Fig. 4D). Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that naltrexone can physically interact with SIRT1 to induce deacetylate activity. Emerging evidence has indicated that macrophage polarization is a crucial step toward the pathogenesis of insulin resistance (26Olefsky J.M. Glass C.K. Macrophages, inflammation, and insulin resistance.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2010; 72 (20148674): 219-24610.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Macrophages of the M1 phenotype act as pro-inflammatory mediators, and M1-like macrophage polarization is closely associated with obesity and diabetes (27Gordon S. Alternative activation of macrophages.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3 (12511873): 23-3510.1038/nri978Crossref PubMed Scopus (4585) Google Scholar), whereas macrophages of the M2 phenotype suppress inflammation (28Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R.

Mathematical model such as Von Bertalanffy growth model and dynamic energy budget models are available for modelling the growth of various organisms but have their demerits for their application to the growth and development of BSF. Also, such dynamic models were not yet applied to the growth of the BSF larvae despite models proven to be useful for automation of industrial production process (e.g. feeding, heating/cooling, ventilation, harvesting, etc.). This work primarily focuses on developing a model based on the principles of the afore mentioned models from literature that can provide accurate mathematical description of the dry mass changes throughout the life cycle and the transition of development phases of the larvae. To further improve the accuracy of these models, various factors affecting the growth and development such as temperature, feed quality, feeding rate, moisture content in feed, and airflow rate are developed and integrated into the dynamic growth model. An extensive set of data were aggregated from various literature and used for the model development, parameter estimation and validation. Models describing the environmental factors were individually validated based on the data sets collected. In addition, the dynamic growth model was also validated for dry mass evolution and development stage transition of larvae reared on different substrate feeding rates. The developed models with the estimated parameters performed well highlighting its application in decision-support systems and automation for large scale production."

However, to use these bacteria successfully in biocontrol mechanisms their effect on the fitness of the vector into which they have been introduced has to be evaluated. This study investigated the effect of two such bacteria candidates, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens, on Anopheles gambiae s.l. fitness. Pupae and larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes were collected by dipping method and reared to adults. The effect of these bacteria on mosquito fitness was assessed by reintroducing isolates of each bacteria separately into antibiotic-treated female adult mosquitoes through sugar meal. Wild type (non-antibiotic-treated) mosquitoes and those antibiotic-treated with no bacteria reintroduction were used as controls. The mosquitoes were monitored on longevity/survival, fecundity, hatch rate, and larval survival. The antibiotic-treated adult mosquitoes had reduced life span with median survival of 14 days while the bacteria-reintroduced groups and the wild type survived to day 22 (p< 0.0001). Treatment with Enterobacter and Serratia did not affect the average egg deposition (p>0.05) but they affected hatch rates positively (p = 0.008). There was, however, some evidence that suggests Enterobacter could have a positive effect on larval development (p < 0.0001). With no observed negative effect on survival/longevity of Anopheles gambiae, introducing E. cloacae and S. marcescens in future bacteria-associated control strategies is unlikely to result in mosquitoes that will be outlived by the wild population. This, however, requires evaluations under field conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3087669175,"Peroxisomal disorders (PD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diseases caused by a defect in peroxisome biogenesis or a disruption of a peroxisomal function at a single enzyme or at transporter level. The main biochemical markers for PD are very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA). The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation of basic diagnostic parameter, i.e. VLCFA, with disease severity, determined through the survival time. We performed a retrospective study in patients with PD (n = 31; aged 1 week—21 years). Evaluation of VLCFA results from patients were as follows: 15 patients with classical Zellweger syndrome (ZS), 3 patients with mild outcome of ZS, 9 individuals with D-Bifunctional Protein Deficiency (DBP), and no specified results in the case of 4 patients. Patients with classical ZS had higher VLCFA levels, compared to individuals with mild form of ZS and also to patients with DBP; for C26:0/C22:0: 0.65±0.18; 0.11±0.09; 0.30±0.13 (P < 0.001) and for C26:0: 5.20±1.78; 0.76±0.46; 2.61±0.97[mg/mL] (P < 0.001) respectively. The only variable parameter, i.e. the one that determines the survival time of patients, was C26:0 (Chi2 = 19,311, P < 0.0001). Correlation coefficient between survival time and C26:0 level was statistically significant (r = -0.762), and the results showed that high levels of C26:0 were associated with short survival time. Conclusion VLCFA levels correlate with the severity of the clinical course of ZS, DBP and mild ZSD. The best predictive value for estimating the projected disease severity and survival time is a concentration of C26:0."

Several studies have shown that feed additives 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate to be effective in reducing enteric methane emissions. The objective of this study was to estimate the net mitigating effect of using 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate on total greenhouse gas emissions in California dairy industry. A life cycle assessment approach was used to conduct a cradle-to-farm gate environmental impact analysis based on dairy production system in California. Emissions associated with crop production, feed additive production, enteric methane, farm management, and manure storage were calculated and expressed as kg CO2 equivalents (CO2e) per kg of energy corrected milk. The total greenhouse gas emissions from baseline, 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate offered during lactation were 1.12, 0.993, and 1.08 kg CO2e/kg energy corrected milk, respectively. The average net reduction rates for 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate were 11.7% and 3.95%, respectively. In both cases, using the feed additives on the whole herd slightly improved overall carbon footprint reduction compared to limiting its use during lactation phase. Although both 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate had effects on decreasing the total greenhouse gas emission, the former was much more effective with no known safety issues in reducing the carbon footprint of dairy production in California."
https://openalex.org/W3087148883,"We constructed an electric multi-rotor autonomous unmanned aerial system (UAS) to perform mosquito control activities. The UAS can be equipped with any of four modules for spraying larvicides, dropping larvicide tablets, spreading larvicide granules, and ultra-low volume spraying of adulticides. The larvicide module sprayed 124 μm drops at 591 mL/min over a 14 m swath for a total application rate of 1.6 L/ha. The tablet module was able to repeatedly deliver 40-gram larvicide tablets within 1.1 m of the target site. The granular spreader covered a 6 m swath and treated 0.76 ha in 13 min at an average rate of 1.8 kg/ha. The adulticide module produced 16 μm drops with an average deposition of 2.6 drops/mm2. UAS pesticide applications were made at rates prescribed for conventional aircraft, limited only by the payload capacity and flight time. Despite those limitations, this system can deliver pesticides with much greater precision than conventional aircraft, potentially reducing pesticide use. In smaller, congested environments or in programs with limited resources, UAS may be a preferable alternative to conventional aircraft."
https://openalex.org/W3087192522,"A forecast of nuisance flooding of Charleston peninsula is presented, based on an analysis of tide records from Charleston Harbor, SC. The forecast was based on past trends in local sea level and tidal harmonics, including the 18.6-yr lunar nodal and annual cycles. The data document an exponential rise in mean sea level. Extrapolating to year 2060 shows that the sea-level trend already is equivalent to the RCP4.5 scenario and on track to exceed NOAA’s intermediate low sea-level rise scenario of 0.5 m this century. If the trend continues, MSL will have risen by 0.22 m in 50 yr at an annual rate of 0.5 cm/yr in 2069. Simulations to 2064–2068, based on an empirical relationship between the annual number of flood events, defined as a water level exceeding 1.17 m NAVD (North American Vertical Datum of 1988), and the annual sum of monthly mean high water (r2 = 0.84), predict annual flood events will rise to the 60 to 75 range. Application of the hourly tidal harmonics to the long-term sea-level trend provided estimates of total land area flooded and duration of flooding. Flood duration is expected to rise to 6.5% by 2046–2050 and 8.2% of time by 2064–2068. The area exposed to flooding will be 4.23 km2 in 2046–2050 and 4.46 km2 in 2064–2068, corresponding to about 20–21% of peninsular area on what was formerly marshland and creeks, filled in earlier centuries. Finally, the estimated cost of defending the city and a proposal for a climate tax are discussed."

MC4R and MRAP2 are expressed in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, a primary region for the control of food intake.

Zebrafish MRAP2a, which is restricted to larval development, suppresses MC4R signaling, whereas MRAP2b, which is expressed in adult zebrafish, increases MC4R's sensitivity to its agonist α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone. Furthermore, MRAP2 enhances signaling through MC4R in vitro, and overexpression of MRAP2 in MC4R-containing paraventricular nucleus neurons leads to a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure in female mice (1Asai M.

This suggests that there are other mechanisms by which MRAP2 also promotes feeding. It is now understood that MRAP2's regulation over GPCRs is not limited to the melanocortin receptor family. MRAP2 has been shown to promote feeding through inhibition of the prokineticin receptor-1, as well as to decrease food intake through inhibition of the orexin receptor (9Chaly A.L. Srisai D.

MRAP2 and MRAP1 are the only two proteins in the eukaryotic proteome that are currently known to exhibit this unusual membrane orientation. The orientation of most membrane proteins is predicted by the “positive-inside rule,” in which the charged amino acids flanking the transmembrane domain determine the overall orientation such that the more positive region faces the cytosol (18Heijne G. The distribution of positively charged residues in bacterial inner membrane proteins correlates with the trans-membrane topology.EMBO J. 1986; 5 (16453726): 3021-302710.1002/j.1460-2075.1986.tb04601.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hartmann E.

Based on this rule, MRAP1 is predicted to insert into the membrane in both orientations, which agrees with experimental data. Using the same line of logic, MRAP2 is predicted to have its N-terminal domain in the cytosol. Nevertheless, recent findings show that MRAP2 has dual topology. It is evident that the positive-inside rule is not sufficient for explaining MRAP2's membrane orientation. Despite the important role MRAP2 plays in the modulation of energy homeostasis, the sequence features within MRAP2 that dictate membrane orientation and dimerization are unknown. MRAP1's membrane orientation and oligomeric state are dependent on a short polybasic segment adjacent to the transmembrane domain (13Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regions of melanocortin 2 (MC2) receptor accessory protein necessary for dual topology and MC2 receptor trafficking and signaling.J. Biol.

Although this motif is conserved in MRAP2, we show that this sequence does not dictate MRAP2's membrane orientation or dimerization in cell culture. Additionally, using truncation mutations, we identify the transmembrane domain of MRAP2 as the minimal dimerization domain. Finally, we show that contrary to the assumption that MRAP2 can only form anti-parallel dimers, MRAP2 can form parallel dimers as well as higher-order oligomers. Our results not only highlight important differences between MRAP1 and MRAP2 but also offer new insight into MRAP2 structure. Understanding the molecular details that determine MRAP2's oligomeric state and membrane orientation will aid in elucidating the mechanism by which MRAP2 regulates GPCRs that are essential for metabolic processes. The dual topology and oligomeric state of MRAP1 is dictated by a short polybasic segment in the N-terminal domain that is directly adjacent to the transmembrane domain (Fig. 1C). Sebag and Hinkle (13Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regions of melanocortin 2 (MC2) receptor accessory protein necessary for dual topology and MC2 receptor trafficking and signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (18981183): 610-61810.1074/jbc.M804413200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) showed that mouse MRAP1 lacking residues 31–37 (MRAP1 Δ31–37) has a fixed membrane orientation such that the N terminus of MRAP1 is extracellular and the C terminus is cytosolic. This polybasic motif that determines the membrane orientation of MRAP1 is conserved in MRAP2. To investigate whether this sequence is required for dual topology of MRAP2, immunocytochemistry and microscopy were used to detect cell surface MRAP2 from intact, nonpermeabilized cells that are transiently transfected with either N-terminally FLAG epitope–tagged or C-terminally FLAG epitope–tagged MRAP2 in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells (Fig. 2A). Both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of WT MRAP2 were detected extracellularly. Unexpectedly, both the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain of MRAP2 lacking the polybasic motif (MRAP2 Δ38–44) were also detected on the cell surface. A control experiment was also performed to ensure that formaldehyde fixation does not result in significant permeabilization of unpermeabilized cells (Fig. S1). Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were used to measure the cell surface N-terminal domain to C-terminal domain ratio of WT MRAP2 Δ38–44 (Fig. 2B). As expected, we find that WT MRAP2 has a cell surface N-terminal domain to C-terminal domain ratio of ∼1. As a control, RAMP3, a single-pass transmembrane protein that was previously shown to favor a conformation with an extracellular N terminus (13Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regions of melanocortin 2 (MC2) receptor accessory protein necessary for dual topology and MC2 receptor trafficking and signaling.J. Biol.

We confirm that although deletion of the polybasic motif in MRAP2 does result in a modest preference for an extracellular N-terminal domain, MRAP2 Δ38–44 still has dual topology. Additionally, the presence of an immunoreactive “doublet band” for MRAP2 Δ38–44 indicates that the N-terminal asparagine residue exists in both glycosylated and unglycosylated forms (Fig. 2C). This further indicates dual topology of MRAP2 Δ38–44 because the N terminus must be in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen for glycosylation to occur. These results show that the conserved polybasic segment that is required for the dual topology of MRAP1 is not required for the dual topology of MRAP2. MRAP1 Δ31–37 cannot form dimers, likely because it has a fixed membrane orientation (13Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regions of melanocortin 2 (MC2) receptor accessory protein necessary for dual topology and MC2 receptor trafficking and signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (18981183): 610-61810.1074/jbc.M804413200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine whether MRAP2 Δ38–44 can form dimers or higher-order oligomers, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with both FLAG- and HA epitope–tagged versions of either WT MRAP2 or MRAP2 Δ38–44. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting showed that both WT MRAP2 and MRAP2 Δ38–44 form dimers or higher-order oligomers or associate through noncovalent interactions with other membrane proteins (Fig. 2D). The same experiment was performed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and yielded the same results (Fig. S2). Overall, these results indicate that the conserved polybasic motif that is required for dual topology, and dimerization in MRAP1 is not required for either dual topology or dimerization/association of MRAP2. MRAP2 is known to form dimers or higher-order oligomers, but the dimerization domain has not been identified. To identify the dimerization domain, constructs were created that either truncate the C-terminal domain (NTD-TM), the N-terminal domain (TM-CTD), or both the N- and C-terminal domains, leaving just the transmembrane domain (TM). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with both FLAG and HA epitope–tagged constructs in the following combinations: TM-CTD + TM-CTD, NTD-TM + NTD-TM, NTD-TM + TM-CTD, and TM + TM. Co-immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting show that neither the N-terminal domain nor the C-terminal domain are required for dimerization or association (Fig. 3A). Specifically, TM-CTD can be co-immunoprecipitated with itself and with NTD-TM (Fig. 3A, fourth, sixth, and seventh lanes), and NTD-TM can be co-immunoprecipitated with itself (Fig. 3A, fifth lane). Finally, the transmembrane domain can also be co-immunoprecipitated with itself (Fig. 3A, eighth lane). The experiment was also performed in CHO cells and yielded the same results (Fig. S2). Based on these results MRAP2 dimerizes or associates through its transmembrane domain. The GXXXG motif is common in transmembrane helix interactions (21Teese M.G. Langosch D. Role of GXXXG motifs in transmembrane domain interactions.Biochemistry. 2015; 54 (26244771): 5125-513510.1021/acs.biochem.5b00495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M.

We also investigated whether the glycine residues within the transmembrane domain of MRAP2 are required for dimerization by mutating the glycine residues that make up this motif to leucine residues (G48L + G52L). Co-immunoprecipitations from cell lysates followed by immunoblotting also show that the glycine residues within the transmembrane domain are not required for MRAP2 dimerization or association (Fig. 3A, ninth lane). Based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments by Sebag and Hinkle, MRAP2, like MRAP1, forms anti-parallel dimers (16Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regulation of G protein–coupled receptor signaling: specific dominant-negative effects of melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3 (20371771): ra2810.1126/scisignal.2000593Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although previous experiments show that MRAP1 forms exclusively anti-parallel dimers and does not form parallel dimers, it is unclear whether this holds true for MRAP2. To determine whether MRAP2 forms parallel dimers, a NanoBiT protein–protein interaction assay was performed. The NanoBiT system is composed of a large BiT (LgBiT) and a small BiT (SmBiT) that have very little to no luciferase activity on their own. However, when LgBiT and SmBiT are in close proximity within the cell, the functional luciferase will then generate a luminescent signal at even low protein expression levels, driven by weak HSV-TK promoter. The low intrinsic affinity between the isolated SmBiT and LgBiT lessens the likelihood of spurious dimerization driven by these segments. The following combinations of DNA were transfected into HEK293T cells: MRAP2-LgBiT + SmBiT-PRKACA, LgBiT-MRAP2 + SmBiT-PRKACA, LgBiT-MRAP2 + MRAP2-SmBiT, and MRAP2-LgBiT + MRAP2-SmBiT. PRKACA is a noninteracting cytosolic protein that is used as a negative control. Surprisingly, when MRAP2-LgBiT and MRAP2-SmBiT are transfected together, we see a NanoBiT luminescence signal that is significantly higher than the negative control (Fig. 4A). These results show that the C-terminal domains are of MRAP2 are in close proximity to each other in live cells, consistent with dimerization (Fig. 4B). MRAP2 Δ38–44, TM-CTD, NTD-TM, TM, and G48L+G52L with C-terminal LgBiT and C-terminal SmBiT also resulted in a significant NanoBiT luminescence signal when compared with the negative control, and these results are consistent with the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Unexpectedly, when LgBiT-MRAP2 and MRAP2-SmBiT are transfected together, there is less NanoBiT signal than the negative control. The absence of a significant NanoBiT signal from the anti-parallel orientation may be due to the inherent size difference between the N- and C-terminal domains of MRAP2, because the C-terminal domain is significantly larger than the N-terminal domain. Once MRAP2 multimers are positioned in the membrane, the shorter length of the N-terminal domain may not favorably allow for a LgBiT and SmBiT interaction. Overall, these results indicate that the C-terminal domains of MRAP2 are in close proximity in the cell but does not exclude anti-parallel MRAP2 dimers. To further test the findings above and investigate whether MRAP2 forms higher-order oligomers, whole-cell cross-linking and blue native PAGE were employed. Whole cells expressing FLAG-MRAP2 were cross-linked with a membrane-permeable, lysine-reactive cross-linker, and the resulting whole-cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 5A). The presence of higher-molecular-weight bands with the apparent molecular weights of cross-linked dimeric and trimeric MRAP2 suggests that MRAP2 forms higher-order oligomers that can be cross-linked in whole cells. MRAP2 containing lysates from non–cross-linked cells were also separated on a polyacrylamide gel under native conditions with varying concentrations of n-dodecyl-β-maltoside detergent (Fig. 5B). Consistent with the cross-linking results, non–cross-linked MRAP2 forms higher-molecular-weight structures. These structures are most likely dimers, tetramers, and octamers based on the molecular weights of the bands. Because native protein shape and the amount of bound detergent will affect protein complex mobility through the gel matrix, the molecular weights predicted from native gels are approximate (23Wittig I. Beckhaus T. Wumaier Z. Karas M. Schägger H. Mass estimation of native proteins by blue native electrophoresis.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9 (20173216): 2149-216110.1074/mcp.M900526-MCP200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Heuberger E.H.M.L. Veenhoff L.M. Duurkens R.H. Friesen R.H.E.

Biol. 2002; 317 (11955011): 591-60010.1006/jmbi.2002.5416Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we cannot rule out that the higher-molecular-weight bands arise from MRAP2 associating with other membrane proteins. If the high molecular weight bands are due to MRAP2 alone, we note that the absence of higher-order oligomer bands such as tetramers and octamers in the cross-linking experiment are likely a result of incomplete cross-linking of higher-order structures. Similarly, the presence of trimer in Fig. 5A may be due to incomplete cross-linking of a tetrameric structure. In summary, these results indicate that MRAP2 forms parallel dimers and higher-order oligomers such that the C-terminal domains of MRAP2 proteins are in close proximity in the membrane (Fig. 5C). The N-terminal and transmembrane domains of MRAP2 and MRAP1 are highly conserved and the N-terminal domain of MRAP1 is essential for its dual topology and homodimerization. However, we show that the mechanism that regulates MRAP2 dimerization is distinct from that of MRAP1. Deletion of the conserved polybasic motif that dictates MRAP1's membrane orientation from MRAP2 does not abolish dual membrane orientation nor dimerization of MRAP2. The positive-inside rule that predicts the orientation of transmembrane domains is based on ∼15 residues on either side of the transmembrane domain and establishes that the more positively charged side will end up on the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane (18Heijne G. The distribution of positively charged residues in bacterial inner membrane proteins correlates with the trans-membrane topology.EMBO J. 1986; 5 (16453726): 3021-302710.1002/j.1460-2075.1986.tb04601.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hartmann E.

In fact, single-point mutations in dual-topology membrane proteins from bacteria that have a near zero charge bias can shift the orientations of these proteins (25Rapp M. Granseth E. Seppälä S. Heijne G.V. Identification and evolution of dual-topology membrane proteins.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13 (16429150): 112-11610.1038/nsmb1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Previous experiments that investigated MRAP1's membrane topology are consistent with both the positive-inside rule and algorithms that predict transmembrane helices and membrane topology such as TMHMM (26Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. A hidden Markov model for predicting transmembrane helices in protein sequences.Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6 (9783223): 175-182PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. S3). Approximately half of MRAP1 is glycosylated, supporting the fact that MRAP1 can be inserted into the membrane in both Nexo/Ccyto and Ncyto/Cexo orientations. MRAP1's dual topology has also been validated by bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments and the presence of both N- and C-terminal antibody epitopes on the cell surface (15Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein MRAP forms antiparallel homodimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Based on the positive-inside rule and computational predictions, MRAP2 is predicted to favor a Ncyto/Cexo orientation. However, this study, along with previous studies (16Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Regulation of G protein–coupled receptor signaling: specific dominant-negative effects of melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein 2.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3 (20371771): ra2810.1126/scisignal.2000593Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), supports MRAP2 having dual topology, contrary to the predicted Ncyto/Cexo orientation. MRAP2's dual topology defies the positive-inside rule. Our study reveals that the molecular features that dictate MRAP1 and MRAP2 orientations are distinctly different. These differences between MRAP1 and MRAP2 highlight the importance of identifying the mechanism behind MRAP2's dual topology, and this will be the subject of future studies. MRAP2 has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with several GPCRs including all five melanocortin receptors, orexin receptor 1 (OX1R), prokineticin receptor 1 (PKR1), and GHSR1a (9Chaly A.L. Srisai D.

https://openalex.org/W3087315291,"Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), a rapidly growing mycobacterium, is an emergent opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic bronchopulmonary infections in individuals with respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Most treatments of M. abscessus pulmonary infections are poorly effective due to the intrinsic resistance of this bacteria against a broad range of antibiotics including anti-tuberculosis agents. Consequently, the number of drugs that are efficient against M. abscessus remains limited. In this context, 19 oxadiazolone (OX) derivatives have been investigated for their antibacterial activity against both the rough (R) and smooth (S) variants of M. abscessus. Several OXs impair extracellular M. abscessus growth with moderated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), or act intracellularly by inhibiting M. abscessus growth inside infected macrophages with MIC values similar to those of imipenem. Such promising results prompted us to identify the potential target enzymes of the sole extra and intracellular inhibitor of M. abscessus growth, i.e., compound iBpPPOX, via activity-based protein profiling combined with mass spectrometry. This approach led to the identification of 21 potential protein candidates being mostly involved in M. abscessus lipid metabolism and/or in cell wall biosynthesis. Among them, the Ag85C protein has been confirmed as a vulnerable target of iBpPPOX. This study clearly emphasizes the potential of the OX derivatives to inhibit the extracellular and/or intracellular growth of M. abscessus by targeting various enzymes potentially involved in many physiological processes of this most drug-resistant mycobacterial species."

This study sought to investigate the reliability, validity, and ability to detect change of MFM32 in individuals with Type 2 and non-ambulant Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Data were used from the Phase 2 study assessing the efficacy and safety of olesoxime. A total of 110 individuals with Type 2 or 3 SMA were included in the analyses. Test-retest reliability (intraclass-correlation coefficient in global impression-defined stable individuals), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), convergent validity (Spearman rank order correlations with other measures), known-groups validity (analysis of covariance comparing Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale -defined groups), and ability to detect change (analysis of covariance comparing global impression-defined groups) were calculated. Strong evidence of test-retest reliability (intraclass-correlation coefficient = 0.93-0.95), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89), convergent validity (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale: rho = 0.87; forced vital capacity: rho = 0.61), known-groups validity (all p<0.0001), and ability to detect change (all p<0.001) were demonstrated.

https://openalex.org/W3087218485,"Background Unexpected gallbladder cancer (UGBC) is sometimes found in the resected gallbladder of patients during or after surgery. Some reports have indicated UGBC identification rates for all gallbladder surgeries, but scarce data are available for the UGBC identification rates for specific gallbladder diseases. The present study was performed to clarify UGBC rates and the factors suspicious for UGBC categorized according to preoperative diagnoses, in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LSC). Methods We recorded data for all LSC surgeries performed in the Department of Surgery, Sada Hospital, Japan since 1991, and analyzed the 28-year data. We used the chi-square test and Kaplan–Meier analysis for this retrospective case–control study. Results The UGBC identification rate was 0.69% (63/9186 patients). The UGBC identification rates categorized according to the preoperative diagnoses were 1.3% (13/969) for acute cholecystitis, 2.4% (16/655) for benign tumor, 2.0% (28/1383) for chronic cholecystitis or cholecystitis, and 0.054% (3/5585) for cholecystolithiasis. The percentage of older patients (≥ 60 years) was significantly higher in UGBCs compared with cases finally diagnosed as benign in each group categorized according to the preoperative diagnoses (p≤0.0014), except for cholecystolithiasis. In cases pre-diagnosed as benign tumor, UGBCs were associated with higher rates of thickened gallbladder wall compared with benign tumor (69.2% vs. 27.9%, respectively; p = 0.0011). UGBCs pre-diagnosed as acute cholecystitis had higher T2–T4 rates (100% vs. 64.3%, respectively; p<0.05) and lower survival rates (p = 0.0149) than UGBCs pre-diagnosed with chronic cholecystitis. Conclusions UGBC identification rates depend on the preoperative diagnosis and range from 0.054% to 2.4%. Older age (≥ 60 years) could be related to UGBC, and a pre-diagnosis of acute cholecystitis might indicate more advanced cancer compared with a pre-diagnosis of chronic cholecystitis."

Sensory evaluation included crumb elasticity, porosity and other characteristics, taste and smell. Among all analyzed gluten-free breads, the sample containing 7.5% share of freeze-dried red potato pulp Magenta Love was characterized by high content of phenolic compounds and dietary fiber, pronounced antioxidant activity, low levels of potentially dangerous acrylamide and good physical and sensory characteristics. Therefore such an addition (7.5% Magenta Love) could be recommended for industrial production of gluten-free bread."

https://openalex.org/W3087277418,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an infectious disease caused by the protozoa Leishmania chagasi, whose main vector in South America is Lutzomyia longipalpis. The disease was diagnosed in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo (ES) for the first time in 1968. Currently, this disease has been considered endemic in 10 municipalities. Furthermore, the presence of L. longipalpis has been detected in eight other municipalities where the transmission has not been reported thus far. In this study, we performed species distribution modeling (SDM) to identify new and most likely receptive areas for VL transmission in ES. The sandflies were both actively and passively collected in various rural area of ES between 1986 and 2017. The collection points were georeferenced using a global positioning system device. Climatic data were retrieved from the WorldClim database, whereas geographic data were obtained from the National Institute for Space Research and the Integrated System of Geospatial Bases of the State of Espírito Santo. The maximum entropy algorithm was used through the MIAmaxent R package to train and test the distribution models for L. longipalpis. The major contributor to model generation was rocky outcrops, followed by temperature seasonality. The SDM predicted the expansion of the L. longipalpis-prone area in the Doce River Valley and limited the probability of expanding outside its watershed. Once the areas predicted suitable for L. longipalpis occurrence are determined, we can avoid the inefficient use of public resources in conducting canine serological surveys where the vector insect does not occur."
https://openalex.org/W3087305934,"Recent studies indicated that the androgen receptor (AR) plays important roles in modulating metastasis of VHL-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms of AR roles in VHL wild-type (VHL-wt) ccRCC, remain unclear. Here we found that AR interacted with VHL to modulate the metastasis of VHL-wt ccRCC via an oxygen-dependent manner. Mechanism dissection revealed that AR could transcriptionally suppress the miR-185-5p expression in the presence of functional VHL-wt protein under a normoxic condition, which might then result in increasing the expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-C via targeting the 3′UTR of mRNAs at a post-transcriptional level. In contrast, under a hypoxic condition, AR could increase miR-185-5p expression to suppress VEGF-C expression, yet this miR-185-5p effect on VEGF-A was reversed via AR’s positive regulation on the HIF2α-increased VEGF-A expression that resulted in increasing VEGF-A in the VHL-wt RCC cells. These distinct AR functions under different oxygen conditions may involve the VHL-impacted ubiquitination and nuclear localization of AR. The differential regulation of VEGF-A vs VEGF-C by AR may then result in differential impacts on the ccRCC metastatic destinations of VHL-wt ccRCC cells under different oxygen conditions. These finer mechanisms may help in the development of a novel therapy to better suppress the ccRCC progression under different oxygenization conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3087493977,"Autoimmune complexes are an important feature of several autoimmune diseases such as lupus, as they contribute to tissue damage through the activation of immune cells. Neutrophils, key players in lupus, interact with immune complexes through Fc gamma receptors (FcgR). Incubation of neutrophils with aggregated-IgGs caused degranulation and increased the surface expression of FcgRI within minutes in a concentration-dependent fashion. After 30 minutes, IgG aggregates (1 mg/mL) upregulated FcgRI by 4.95 ± 0.45-fold. FcgRI-positive neutrophils reached 67.24% ± 6.88% on HA-IgGs stimulated neutrophils, from 3.12% ± 1.62% in non-stimulated cells, ranking IgG-aggregates among the most potent known agonists. FcgRIIa, and possibly FcgRIIIa, appeared to mediate this upregulation. Also, FcgRI-dependent signaling proved necessary for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in response to IgG-aggregates. Finally, combinations of bacterial materials with aggregates dramatically boosted ROS production. This work suggests FcgRI as an essential component in the response of human neutrophils to immune complexes leading to the production of ROS, which may help explain how neutrophils contribute to tissue damage associated with immune complex-associated diseases, such as lupus."

However, very little information is available on the impact of insecticide resistance on blood feeding process in mosquitoes. Here, using two recently detected DNA-based metabolic markers in the major malaria vector, An. funestus, we investigated how metabolic resistance genes could affect the blood meal intake. After allowing both the field F1 and lab F8 Anopheles funestus strains to feed on the human arm for 30 minutes, we assessed the association between key parameters of blood meal process including, probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success, blood meal size, and markers of glutathione S-transferase (L119F-GSTe2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP6P9a_R)-mediated metabolic resistance. None of the parameters of blood meal process was associated with L119F-GSTe2 genotypes. By contrast, for CYP6P9a_R, homozygous resistant mosquitoes were significantly more able to blood-feed than homozygous susceptible (OR = 3.3; CI 95%: 1.4-7.7; P = 0.01) mosquitoes. Moreover, the volume of blood meal ingested by CYP6P9a-SS mosquitoes was lower than that of CYP6P9a-RS (P<0.004) and of CYP6P9a-RR (P<0.006). This suggests that CYP6P9a gene is inked with the feeding success and blood meal size of An. funestus. However, no correlation was found in the expression of CYP6P9a and that of genes encoding for salivary proteins involved in blood meal process. This study suggests that P450-based metabolic resistance may influence the blood feeding process of Anopheles funestus mosquito and consequently its ability to transmit malaria parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3087654550,"Established research has documented the pervasive influence of incentives (i.e., food, sex, money) on animal and human behavior. Additionally, motivational theories postulating intra-individually stable preferences for specific types of incentives (i.e., motives) highlight that effects of a given incentive are highly dependent on the motive disposition of the individual. Indeed, also research on motor performance has documented the interactive effects of motives and motive-specific incentives on motor outcomes. However, the majority of this research has relied on correlational designs focusing on the effects of the achievement motive, with few studies addressing the role of the affiliation and power motive. In order to extend findings in this domain, we tested whether a fit between individuals' power (affiliation) motive and incentives of competition (cooperation) would improve motor performance. Following baseline measures, participants performed a dart-throwing task as part of a dyadic performance (i.e., cooperative) or a one-on-one competition scenario. In the dyadic performance scenario, a stronger affiliation motive did not translate to better performance. However, in the one-on-one competition scenario a stronger power motive was associated with better performance. Results highlight the role of the power motive in predicting motor performance, particularly in competitive situations."
https://openalex.org/W3087165752,"The objective of this study was to develop a computer-aided method to quantify the obvious degree of growth ring boundaries of softwood species, based on data analysis with some image processing technologies. For this purpose, a 5× magnified cross-section color micro-image of softwood was cropped into 20 sub-images, and then every image was binarized as a gray image according to an automatic threshold value. After that, the number of black pixels in the gray image was counted row by row and the number of black pixels was binarized to 0 or 100. Finally, a transition band from earlywood to latewood on the sub-image was identified. If everything goes as planned, the growth ring boundaries of the sub-image would be distinct. Otherwise would be indistinct or absent. If more than 50% sub-images are distinct, with the majority voting method, the growth ring boundaries of softwood would be distinct, otherwise would be indistinct or absent. The proposed method has been visualized as a growth-ring-boundary detecting system based on the .NET Framework. A sample of 100 micro-images (see S1 Fig via https://github.com/senly2019/Lin-Qizhao/) of softwood cross-sections were selected for evaluation purposes. In short, this detecting system computes the obvious degree of growth ring boundaries of softwood species by image processing involving image importing, image cropping, image reading, image grayscale, image binarization, data analysis. The results showed that the method used avoided mistakes made by the manual comparison method of identifying the presence of growth ring boundaries, and it has a high accuracy of 98%."
https://openalex.org/W3087498435,"Levels of protein translation by ribosomes are governed both by features of the translation machinery as well as sequence properties of the mRNAs themselves. We focus here on a striking three-nucleotide periodicity, characterized by overrepresentation of GCN codons and underrepresentation of G at the second position of codons, that is observed in Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of mRNAs. Our examination of mRNA sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that this periodicity is particularly pronounced in the initial codons—the ramp region—of ORFs of genes with high protein expression. It is also found in mRNA sequences immediately following non-standard AUG start sites, located upstream or downstream of the standard annotated start sites of genes. To explore the possible influences of the ramp GCN periodicity on translation efficiency, we tested edited ramps with accentuated or depressed periodicity in two test genes, SKN7 and HMT1. Greater conformance to (GCN)n was found to significantly depress translation, whereas disrupting conformance had neutral or positive effects on translation. Our recent Molecular Dynamics analysis of a subsystem of translocating ribosomes in yeast revealed an interaction surface that H-bonds to the +1 codon that is about to enter the ribosome decoding center A site. The surface, comprised of 16S/18S rRNA C1054 and A1196 (E. coli numbering) and R146 of ribosomal protein Rps3, preferentially interacts with GCN codons, and we hypothesize that modulation of this mRNA-ribosome interaction may underlie GCN-mediated regulation of protein translation. Integration of our expression studies with large-scale reporter studies of ramp sequence variants suggests a model in which the C1054-A1196-R146 (CAR) interaction surface can act as both an accelerator and braking system for ribosome translation."

https://openalex.org/W3087189687,"Currently, aortic valve replacement is the only treatment capable of relieving left ventricle pressure overload in patients with severe aortic stenosis. It aims to improve cardiac function and revert hypertrophy, by triggering myocardial reverse remodeling. Despite immediately relieving afterload, reverse remodeling turns out to be extremely variable. Among other factors, the extent of reverse remodeling may depend on how well ubiquitin-proteasome system tackle hypertrophy. Therefore, we assessed tagged ubiquitin and ubiquitin ligases in the left ventricle collected from patients undergoing valve replacement and tested their association to the degree of reverse remodeling. Patients were classified according to the regression of left ventricle mass (ΔLVM) and assigned to complete (ΔLVM≥15%) or incomplete (ΔLVM≤5%) reverse remodeling groups. No direct inter-group differences were observed. Nevertheless, correlation analysis supports a fundamental role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system during reverse remodeling. Indeed, total protein ubiquitination was associated to hypertrophic indexes such as interventricular septal thickness (r = 0.55, p = 0.03) and posterior wall thickness (r = 0.65, p = 0.009). No significant correlations were observed for Muscle Ring Finger 3. Surprisingly, though, higher levels of atrogin-1 were associated to postoperative interventricular septal thickness (r = 0.71, p = 0.005). In turn, Muscle Ring Finger 1 correlated negatively with this postoperative hypertrophy marker (r = -0.68, p = 0.005), suggesting a cardioprotective role during reverse remodeling. No significant correlations were found with left ventricle mass regression, although a trend for a negative association between the ligase Murine Double Minute 2 and mass regression (r = -0.44, p = 0.10) was found. Animal studies will be necessary to understand whether this ligase is protective or detrimental. Herein, we show, for the first time, an association between the preoperative myocardial levels of ubiquitin ligases and postoperative hypertrophy, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting ubiquitin ligases in incomplete reverse remodeling."

When designing the protocol, most researchers refer to electronic databases and extract protocol elements using a keyword search. However, state-of-the-art database systems only offer text-based searches for user-entered keywords. In this study, we present a database system with a context-dependent and protocol-element-selection function for successfully designing a clinical trial protocol. To do this, we first introduce a database for a protocol retrieval system constructed from individual protocol data extracted from 184,634 clinical trials and 13,210 frame structures of clinical trial protocols. The database contains a variety of semantic information that allows the filtering of protocols during the search operation. Based on the database, we developed a web application called the clinical trial protocol database system (CLIPS; available at https://corus.kaist.edu/clips). This system enables an interactive search by utilizing protocol elements. To enable an interactive search for combinations of protocol elements, CLIPS provides optional next element selection according to the previous element in the form of a connected tree.

I hadn't really thought about it before. Construction? I had spent some summers in college as a frame carpenter and gotten pretty good at it. A musician? Appealing—I'm not too bad on blues harmonica—but I knew I wasn't good enough to make a living at it. “A mailman,” I blurted out, “so I could walk around all day and think about things.” I'm not sure where the idea came from; I had just flown from New Orleans—where I completed my Ph.D.—to the Mile High City, so I was probably a bit lightheaded at the time. Little did I know then that, after a 30-year career in science, I would in fact end up as a letter carrier, making a difference in a way I never would have expected.

I first became inspired by the idea that my work could make a positive, practical impact in the world after I transitioned from academia to biotech. I had initially been attracted to scientific research by the fun of solving problems and discovering something new. During my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research, that meant uncovering the mechanisms certain viruses use to replicate in cells. But as I started in biotech and my work became more applied, I realized that my research could lead to potential treatments for human disease. I worked on developing gene therapy approaches to treat osteoarthritis and restenosis, antiviral drugs against hepatitis B and C, and—in a late-career return to academia—a less costly vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV).

Still, none of my projects resulted in anything tangible to help people. I also became accustomed to being bounced around by forces that felt outside of my control and to taking career opportunities as they came up. My first biotech job ended when the company restructured and my position was eliminated. I landed a job at another biotech company, but just 1 year in, it went bankrupt and I was laid off. Next, I secured a “senior postdoc” in academia—which lasted until Congress instigated sequestration in 2013, the grant that funded my project was cut, and I was out of a job again. Eventually, after some part-time consulting work with a few small startups, I decided I needed something more substantial and permanent.

I felt I still had some good years left, and that I had not yet made a difference in society, but I wasn't able to find another full-time position in a science-related field. I started to ponder that question from my postdoc interview all those years ago. What else could I do besides science? How could I still make a meaningful contribution?

I decided to completely change gears and get a job as a letter carrier for the United States Postal Service. Even by my standards of adaptability, this last change was pretty dramatic—and a little hard to get used to. I have a Ph.D. and 30 years of experience conducting scientific research, yet here I am, delivering mail. But I try to keep an open mind. Although I miss research, I do enjoy getting to walk around and think about things. What would my life look like if, after my first biotech furlough, I had taken that interview for a director of biology position in San Francisco? Will that HPV vaccine patent I co-authored ever amount to anything? Why is my car making that noise?

Lately I've been thinking about the COVID-19 pandemic and my career. It's ironic that although I'm trained as a virologist—surely an essential skill these days—it is in my new role that I am considered an “essential worker.” I certainly hope I'm helping in the fight against COVID-19 by delivering election ballots, medicines, and checks (among the bills, too, of course). Truth be told, I believe I am making a more direct and positive impact on people's lives now than when I was in science. Finding out that viral protein X interacts with cellular protein Y was cool—but it doesn't touch the average person on the street the way getting the mail does."

https://openalex.org/W3087690858,"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and maturation of a fibrillar tumor microenvironment play important roles in breast cancer progression. A better understanding of how these events promote cancer cell migration and invasion could help identify new strategies to curb metastasis. The nucleus and Golgi affect migration in a microenvironment-dependent manner. Nucleus size and mechanics influence the ability of a cell to squeeze through confined tumor microenvironments. Golgi positioning determines front-rear polarity necessary for migration. While the roles of individual attributes of nucleus and Golgi in migration are being clarified, how their manifold features are inter-related and work together remains to be understood at a systems level. Here, to elucidate relationships among nucleus and Golgi properties, we quantified twelve morphological and positional properties of these organelles during fibrillar migration of human mammary epithelial cells. Principal component analysis (PCA) reduced the twelve-dimensional space of measured properties to three principal components that capture 75% of the variations in organelle features. Unexpectedly, nucleus and Golgi properties that co-varied in a PCA model built with data from untreated cells were largely similar to co-variations identified using data from TGFβ-treated cells. Thus, while TGFβ-mediated EMT significantly alters gene expression and motile phenotype, it did not significantly affect the relationships among nucleus size, aspect ratio and orientation with migration direction and among Golgi size and nucleus-Golgi separation distance. Indeed, in a combined PCA model incorporating data from untreated and TGFβ-treated cells, scores of individual cells occupy overlapping regions in principal component space, indicating that TGFβ-mediated EMT does not promote a unique Golgi-nucleus phenotype during fibrillar migration. These results suggest that migration along spatially-confined fiber-like tracks employs a conserved nucleus-Golgi arrangement that is independent of EMT state."
