https://openalex.org/W3172858351,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undergone progressive change, with variants conferring advantage rapidly becoming dominant lineages, e.g., B.1.617. With apparent increased transmissibility, variant B.1.617.2 has contributed to the current wave of infection ravaging the Indian subcontinent and has been designated a variant of concern in the United Kingdom. Here we study the ability of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent and vaccine sera to neutralize B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, complement this with structural analyses of Fab/receptor binding domain (RBD) complexes, and map the antigenic space of current variants. Neutralization of both viruses is reduced compared with ancestral Wuhan-related strains, but there is no evidence of widespread antibody escape as seen with B.1.351. However, B.1.351 and P.1 sera showed markedly more reduction in neutralization of B.1.617.2, suggesting that individuals infected previously by these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B.1.617.2. This observation provides important new insights for immunization policy with future variant vaccines in non-immune populations."
https://openalex.org/W3176969175,"SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19. A concern regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or a history of SARS-CoV infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated Fc receptor-γ (FcγR)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated FcγR-independent in vitro infection enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Three of 46 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can rarely occur in SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques."

Grieneisen et al. examined changes in the microbiomes of 585 wild baboons from fecal samples collected over 14 years (see the Perspective by Cortes-Ortiz and Amato). Almost all microbiome traits tested demonstrated some level of statistically significant heritability. Most heritability values were low but varied over time correlating with the age of the host. Baboons live in an environment similar to that postulated for early humans and have a microbiome similar to that of humans. Thus, this heritability of the microbiome may reflect similar genetic determinants in humans, for which similar datasets are not available.

https://openalex.org/W3181096911,"The discovery of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates brings us tantalizingly close to a new material class that mirrors the cuprate superconductors. Here, we report on magnetic excitations in these nickelates, measured using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ni L3-edge, to shed light on the material complexity and microscopic physics. Undoped NdNiO2 possesses a branch of dispersive excitations with a bandwidth of approximately 200 meV, reminiscent of strongly-coupled, antiferromagnetically aligned spins on a square lattice, despite a lack of evidence for long range magnetic order. The significant damping of these modes indicates the importance of coupling to rare-earth itinerant electrons. Upon doping, the spectral weight and energy decrease slightly, while the modes become overdamped. Our results highlight the role of Mottness in infinite-layer nickelates."
https://openalex.org/W3181734343,"Increasing cases, insufficient amount of personal protection equipment, extremely demanding workloads, and lack of adequate therapies to save lives can contribute to a psychological burden directly related to working during disease outbreaks. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of contracting COVID-19 due to its ability to spread efficiently through asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. There are limited studies assessing the pandemic’s psychological impact on HCWs, specifically those in close proximity to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our study explored the emotions, perceived stressors, and coping strategies of front-line HCWs at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 during the first surge at our community-based teaching hospital, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Connecticut. A validated comprehensive questionnaire derived and modified from previous epidemics was used to inquire about staff feelings, factors that caused stress and factors that mitigated stress. Personal coping strategies and factors that can increase staff’s motivation to work during future events of similar nature were also asked. Emotional reactions, coping mechanisms, and stressors varied by healthcare role, while some experiences and reactions were similar among groups. Willingness to participate in a second wave of the pandemic or future outbreaks is strongly driven by adequate personal protective equipment, financial recognition, and recognition from management, similarly reported in previous disease outbreaks. All groups felt a reduction in stress due to a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, as well as when sharing jokes or humor with colleagues. Our HCWs at high risk of exposure experienced significant emotional distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding the needs and experiences of our HCWs at highest risk, we can improve our psychological support using targeted interventions during future waves of this pandemic or similar devastating events."

Bristow et al. analyzed drill samples collected by the Curiosity rover as it climbed up sedimentary layers in the crater. They found evidence of past reactions with liquid water and sulfate brines, which could have percolated through the clay from an overlying sulfate deposit. Similar sulfate deposits are widespread across the planet and represent some of the last sedimentary rocks to form before the planet lost its surface liquid water, so the results inform our understanding of the geologic processes that occurred as Mars dried out.

Nicotine also induces anxiety through an as yet unknown circuitry. We found that nicotine injection drives opposite functional responses of two distinct populations of VTA DA neurons with anatomically segregated projections: it activates neurons that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), whereas it inhibits neurons that project to the amygdala nuclei (Amg). We further show that nicotine mediates anxiety-like behavior by acting on β2-subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the VTA. Finally, using optogenetics, we bidirectionally manipulate the VTA-NAc and VTA-Amg pathways to dissociate their contributions to anxiety-like behavior. We show that inhibition of VTA-Amg DA neurons mediates anxiety-like behavior, while their activation prevents the anxiogenic effects of nicotine. These distinct subpopulations of VTA DA neurons with opposite responses to nicotine may differentially drive the anxiogenic and the reinforcing effects of nicotine.

These distinct subpopulations of VTA DA neurons with opposite responses to nicotine may differentially drive the anxiogenic and the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Nicotine is the principal addictive component that drives continued tobacco use. The initiation of addiction involves the mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system, which contributes to the processing of rewarding stimuli during the overall shaping of successful behaviors (Schultz, 2007Schultz W. Multiple dopamine functions at different time courses.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Addictive drugs such as nicotine are assumed to hijack the mechanisms of reinforcement learning, leading to an overvaluation of the drug reward at the expense of natural rewards. Although drug-induced reinforcement learning generally involves an increase in extracellular DA concentration in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are drug dependent (Changeux, 2010Changeux J.-P.

Neurosci. 2016; 39: 257-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nicotine exerts its reinforcing effects through the direct activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), a family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (Changeux et al., 1998Changeux J.-P. Bertrand D. Corringer P.J. Dehaene S. Edelstein S. Léna C. Le Novère N. Marubio L. Picciotto M. Zoli M.

Cell-type-specific optogenetic manipulations have confirmed that DA cell activation is sufficient to drive the transition toward addiction and established causal links between DA neuron activation and drug-adaptive behaviors (Pascoli et al., 2015Pascoli V.

However, such a view does not take into account the heterogeneity of midbrain DA neurons and the possibility that different messages can be transmitted in parallel from DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Indeed, VTA DA neurons belong to anatomically distinct circuits, differ in their molecular features, and show diverse responses to external stimuli (Lammel et al., 2008Lammel S. Hetzel A. Häckel O.

DA neurons transmit signals related not only to salience and reward but also to aversive stimuli (Brischoux et al., 2009Brischoux F. Chakraborty S. Brierley D.I.

Although the vast majority of research groups that have examined nicotine-evoked responses have reported homogeneous activation of DA neurons and an increase in DA release in their projection areas (Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988Di Chiara G.

Nicotine-mediated activation of dopaminergic neurons in distinct regions of the ventral tegmental area.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2011; 36: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Therefore, a key issue is how the multiple effects of nicotine map onto DA cell diversity and whether nAChR or other features can define different neuronal subpopulations that, through their response to nicotine, can influence specific behaviors. We recorded the response of VTA DA neurons to an intravenous (i.v.) injection of nicotine using single-cell electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized mice. We used a dose of nicotine (30 μg/kg) that has been shown to be reinforcing in the context of i.v. self-administration (Morel et al., 2014Morel C. Fattore L. Pons S. Hay Y.A. Marti F. Lambolez B. De Biasi M. Lathrop M. Fratta W. Maskos U. Faure P. Nicotine consumption is regulated by a human polymorphism in dopamine neurons.Mol. Psychiatry. 2014; 19: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These neurons were first identified during the recordings on the basis of their electrophysiological properties (i.e., firing rate and action potential width) (Mameli-Engvall et al., 2006Mameli-Engvall M. Evrard A. Pons S. Maskos U. Svensson T.H. Changeux J.-P. Faure P.

Valverde S. Tolu S. Dautan D. Hay A. Morel C. Cui Y. Lambolez B. Venance L. Marti F. Faure P. A concurrent excitation and inhibition of dopaminergic subpopulations in response to nicotine.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar; Pinault, 1996Pinault D. A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or Neurobiotin.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1996; 65: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). All neurons were confirmed as DA neurons by post hoc immunofluorescence with co-labeling for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and NB (Figure 1A). Acute i.v. nicotine injections induced a significant variation of DA neuron firing rates, producing either an increase or a decrease in firing rate that was absent in control experiments with saline. Indeed, the variations in firing frequency had a unimodal distribution for saline injections (n = 233 neurons) but a bimodal distribution for nicotine injections (n = 245; Figure 1B, comparison of distribution, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.001; see also Figure S1). Among the 245 identified DA neurons, some were activated (Nic+; n = 155) whereas others were inhibited (Nic−, n = 88) by nicotine injection (Figure 1C), in line with our previous findings (Eddine et al., 2015Eddine R. Valverde S. Tolu S. Dautan D. Hay A. Morel C. Cui Y. Lambolez B. Venance L. Marti F. Faure P. A concurrent excitation and inhibition of dopaminergic subpopulations in response to nicotine.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 8184Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Nicotine-induced increases or decreases in DA neuron firing rate were of similar amplitude (about 35% from baseline for a dose of 30 μg/kg) and were higher in amplitude than saline-evoked responses (Figure 1D). In addition, nicotine-induced changes in DA neuron firing rate were dose dependent and, importantly, maintained the polarity of their response (i.e., either an increase or decrease) at all doses tested (Figure 1E). Finally, to rule out potential confounding effects of anesthesia on the activity of VTA DA neurons, putative VTA DA neurons (n = 16) were recorded in freely moving mice (Figures S2A–S2B), and nicotine or saline was injected into the tail vein (30 μg/kg i.v.; see STAR Methods). We observed VTA DA neurons that were either activated (Nic+; n = 8) or inhibited (Nic−; n = 8) by the nicotine injection (Figure 1F), replicating the results we found in anesthetized mice (comparisons between saline-induced and nicotine-induced firing rate variations by Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction, p = 0.02 for activated neurons and p < 0.001 for inhibited neurons). Therefore, the nature of nicotine-evoked responses (i.e., activation or inhibition) constitutes a marker that allows the robust segregation of VTA DA neurons into two populations. We then sought to determine whether the spontaneous activity of these two populations of DA neurons differ in anesthetized mice. The basal activity of VTA DA neurons is characterized by the firing rate and the percentage of spikes within a burst (%SWB) (Mameli-Engvall et al., 2006Mameli-Engvall M. Evrard A. Pons S. Maskos U. Svensson T.H. Changeux J.-P. Faure P. Hierarchical control of dopamine neuron-firing patterns by nicotinic receptors.Neuron. 2006; 50: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Bursts are classically identified as discrete events consisting of a sequence of spikes with (1) a burst onset defined by two consecutive spikes within an interval of <80 ms and (2) the end of a burst defined by an inter-spike interval of >160 ms (Grace and Bunney, 1984aGrace A.A. Bunney B.S. The control of firing pattern in nigral dopamine neurons: burst firing.J. Neurosci. 1984; 4: 2877-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Ungless and Grace, 2012Ungless M.A. Grace A.A. Are you or aren’t you? Challenges associated with physiologically identifying dopamine neurons.Trends Neurosci. 2012; 35: 422-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We found that nicotine-activated and nicotine-inhibited DA neurons had similar firing rates (Δ = 0.26 Hz, p = 0.0506) and bursting activities (Δ = 3.5%, p = 0.064) (Figure S2C). An analysis of the distribution of burst time intervals also highlighted different profiles in the distribution of inter-spike intervals depending on the burst length (Figure S2C). Other parameters describing cell spontaneous activity (e.g., coefficient of variation or bursting frequency) were analyzed, but none of them revealed a difference between nicotine-activated and nicotine-inhibited DA neurons. Finally, a multiple logistic regression was used to predict the probability of response type (inhibited/activated) on the basis of predictor variables (the firing frequency, the coefficient of variation, %SWB, and bursting frequency). Only the spontaneous firing frequency was statistically associated to the outcome (p = 0.007), and the classification prediction was very low (about 36%). Overall, differences between the two groups could be detected, yet nicotine-evoked responses could not be predicted on the basis of the sole analysis of spontaneous activity. We next asked whether these two populations were anatomically segregated. NB-filled cell bodies of each responding neuron (n = 243) were positioned onto mouse brain atlas plates (Paxinos and Franklin, 2004Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Gulf Professional Publishing, 2004Google Scholar) (Figure S3) to study their anatomical location. As illustrated by a single atlas plate schematic (bregma − 3.3 mm), anatomical coordinates suggest that the inhibited neurons were located more medially within the VTA than the activated neurons, independently of their anteroposterior or dorsoventral positions (Figure 1G). The DA system is heterogeneous and is increasingly thought about in terms of anatomically and functionally distinct sub-networks (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012Watabe-Uchida M. Zhu L. Ogawa S.K. Vamanrao A. Uchida N. Whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons.Neuron. 2012; 74: 858-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). DA neurons in the VTA have been reported to project to different terminal regions on the basis of their localization along the mediolateral axis (Beier et al., 2015Beier K.T. Steinberg E.E. DeLoach K.E. Xie S. Miyamichi K. Schwarz L. Gao X.J. Kremer E.J. Malenka R.C. Luo L.

Therefore, we next investigated whether these two subpopulations belong to anatomically distinct DA circuits by probing nicotine-evoked responses of DA neurons with identified projection sites. To do so, we first targeted the NAc by simultaneously injecting green RetroBeads (RB), a retrograde tracer, in three sub-nuclei: the lateral shell (NAcLSh), the medial shell (NAcMSh), and the core (Figure S4A). Two weeks later, spontaneous and nicotine-evoked activities of VTA DA neurons were recorded in vivo in anesthetized mice, and neurons were then labeled with NB. Triple-labeling immunofluorescence allowed us to confirm post hoc the DA nature (TH+), projection site (RB+ or RB−), and position (NB+) of all recorded neurons (Figure 2A; Figure S4B). We recorded and labeled 32 nicotine-activated and 17 nicotine-inhibited neurons in mice with RB injected in the NAc (all shell + core), among which 30 neurons were further identified as NAc-projecting (RB+, TH+) neurons. Among the NAc-projecting DA neurons, 93% (28 of 30) were activated by nicotine, while only 7% of neurons (2 of 30) were inhibited. In contrast, the remaining 19 DA neurons showed no evidence of projection to the NAc (RB−, TH+), and 79% of these neurons (15 of 19) were inhibited by a nicotine injection, while 21% (4 of 19) were activated (Figures 2B and 2C). The proportion of nicotine-activated neurons in NAc-projecting cells was thus significantly greater than what would be expected from the entire population of RB+ and RB− neurons (Pearson’s chi-square test, p < 0.001). A similar analysis was carried out on mice with a single RB injection site of either the NAcMSh or the NAcLSh to examine whether this effect was driven by a specific NAc sub-nucleus. Analysis of the nicotine-evoked responses on NAcMSh-projecting DA neurons (n = 14 RB+, TH+; n = 8 RB−, TH+) and NAcLSh-projecting DA neurons (n = 6 RB+, TH+; n = 6 RB−, TH+) leads to the same conclusion that the majority of DA neurons that project to the NAc are activated by nicotine, regardless of the specific NAc sub-nucleus they project to (Figure S5). In a second series of experiments, RB were injected in the amygdala nuclei (Amg), targeting both the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA) (Figure S4C). All recorded neurons were once again labeled with NB and confirmed as DA post hoc by triple-labeling immunofluorescence (TH+, NB+, RB+/−; Figure 2D; Figure S4D). We recorded and labeled 26 nicotine-activated and 26 nicotine-inhibited neurons in mice with RB injected in the Amg (BLA + CeA) (Figures 2E and 2F), among which 22 VTA DA neurons were confirmed as Amg-projecting (RB+, TH+) neurons. Among the Amg-projecting DA neurons, 86% (19 of 22) were nicotine inhibited, while only 14% (3 of 22) were activated. In contrast, DA neurons without evidence of projection to the Amg (RB−, TH+) were mainly nicotine activated (77% [23 of 30]), with 23% of neurons (7 of 30) inhibited (Figures 2E and 2F). The proportion of inhibited neurons in Amg-projecting cells was thus significantly greater than what would be expected from the entire population of RB+ and RB− neurons (Pearson’s chi-square test, p < 0.001). Analysis of the distribution of the nicotine-evoked variation in firing frequency for NAc-projecting (n = 30) and Amg-projecting (n = 22) neurons revealed two different distributions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.001) with opposite modes (i.e., positive and negative variations; Figure 2G). Overall, these results indicate that the majority of VTA DA neurons activated by an i.v. nicotine injection project to the NAc (core or shell), whereas the majority of nicotine-inhibited neurons project to the Amg (comparison of the percentages of inhibited and activated neurons in Amg-projecting neurons and NAc-projecting neurons by Pearson’s chi-square test, p < 0.001). Notably, in line with previous reports (Lammel et al., 2008Lammel S. Hetzel A. Häckel O. Jones I. Liss B. Roeper J. Unique properties of mesoprefrontal neurons within a dual mesocorticolimbic dopamine system.Neuron. 2008; 57: 760-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), further anatomical analysis of triple-labeled VTA sections revealed that Amg-projecting DA neurons are located more medially in the VTA than NAc-projecting DA neurons (Figure S4E). We found that NAc-projecting and Amg-projecting DA neurons had similar firing rates (p = 0.8), but Amg-projecting neurons tended to have higher bursting activity (p = 0.28), in line with what we had previously observed for nicotine-activated and nicotine-inhibited VTA DA neurons (Figure S4F; also see Figure S2C). We then probed how these opposite changes in the firing of VTA DA neurons in response to nicotine injection translate into DA release in the NAc and Amg. Using in vivo fiber photometry and a genetically encoded DA sensor (GRABDA2m; Sun et al., 2018Sun F. Zeng J. Jing M. Zhou J. Feng J. Owen S.F. Luo Y. Li F. Wang H.

We found that nicotine injection evoked an increase of DA release in the NAcLSh, whereas it produced a decrease of DA release in the BLA (Figure 2I), in agreement with our electrophysiological results at the cell body level. Together, these results confirm that nicotine drives opposite functional responses within two distinct DA pathways from the VTA. Finally, we took advantage of the anatomical distinction between these two pathways to analyze the respective electrophysiological properties of their VTA DA neurons in ex vivo patch-clamp recordings. NAc-projecting (MSh + LSh + core) or Amg-projecting (BLA + CeA) DA neurons were labeled with RB (Figures S6A and S6B). Amg-projecting DA neurons showed higher excitability (Figures S6C and S6D) than NAc-projecting DA neurons, but no difference in nicotine-evoked currents was found between these two populations (Figures S6E and S6F). These results indicate that these two VTA DA cell populations have different membrane properties but do not markedly differ in the functional expression of somatodendritic nAChR. We next asked whether these two distinct DA sub-circuits are associated with different behavioral outcomes after an acute injection of nicotine. Nicotine is known to have rewarding properties, which require the activation of VTA DA neurons (Durand-de Cuttoli et al., 2018Durand-de Cuttoli R. Mondoloni S. Marti F. Lemoine D. Nguyen C.

However, nicotine can also induce negative outcomes such as anxiety-like behaviors and stress-induced depressive-like states (Kutlu and Gould, 2015Kutlu M.G. Gould T.J.

We hypothesized that the activation and inhibition of the different DA neuron pathways have distinct roles in nicotine-induced behavior. We first aimed to establish the role of the VTA in the anxiogenic effects of acute nicotine exposure. To this end, mice were placed in an elevated O maze (EOM) after an acute injection of either saline or nicotine (intraperitoneal [i.p.], 0.5 mg/kg, injected 1 min before the test), and we found that nicotine, but not saline, reduced exploration of the open arms over time (Figure 3A; see Figure S7A for individual data). Mice that received nicotine injections also showed fewer entries into the open arms (Figure S7A), and this anxiety-like phenotype was not related to a detectable effect of nicotine on locomotor activity in an open field (OF; Figure S7B). Next, to probe the specific role of the VTA in this anxiogenic effect, we locally infused nicotine into this brain region (Figure S7C) 1 min before the EOM test, using bilaterally implanted cannulas. As with i.p. injections, we found that the infusion of nicotine, but not saline, directly into the VTA decreased exploration of th"

Patients in conservative management for chronic kidney disease (CKD) have received attention only recently, therefore less is known about how COVID-19 affects this population. The aim of this study was to provide evidence on COVID-19 incidence and mortality in CKD patients followed up in an integrated healthcare program and in the population living in the same catchment area. The study population included CKD patients recruited in the Emilia-Romagna Prevention of Progressive Renal Insufficiency (PIRP) project, followed up in the 4 nephrology units (Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini) of the Romagna Local Health Authority (Italy) and alive at 1.01.2020. We estimated the incidence of COVID-19, its related mortality and the excess mortality within this PIRP cohort as of 31.07.2020. COVID-19 incidence in CKD patients was 4.09% (193/4,716 patients), while in the general population it was 0.46% (5,195/1,125,574). The crude mortality rate among CKD patients with COVID-19 was 44.6% (86/193), compared to 4.7% (215/4,523) in CKD patients without COVID-19. The excess mortality of March-April 2020 was +69.8% than the average mortality of March-April 2015–19 in the PIRP cohort. In a cohort mostly including regularly followed up CKD patients, the incidence of COVID-19 among CKD patients was strongly related to the spread of the infection in the community, while its lethality is associated with the underlying kidney condition and comorbidities. COVID-19 related mortality was about ten times higher than that of CKD patients without COVID. For this reason, it is urgent to offer a direct protection to CKD patients by prioritizing their vaccination."

Ensuring the global supply of corn, and thereby the energy and food security of nations has become particularly important. To understand the importance of corn production as an influencing mechanism of global food supplies, the present study researched the corn production of typical farms in major corn-producing and importing countries around the world. I selected the corn input and output data of 18 typical farms in 12 countries from 2012 to 2019, used the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model to calculate the technical efficiency of corn production, and built a tobit model to explore the impact of farming methods, input elements, supporting services, and other factors on efficiency. The study established that the average comprehensive technical efficiency of corn production on a typical farm was 0.863, and the average loss was 13.7%. In addition, it concluded that intensive tillage and conservation tillage have high technical efficiency. It also demonstrated that the proportion of mechanical labour and technical efficiency is in a ‘U’-shaped relationship, among others."

Receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-RBD), and N protein, demonstrated sensitivity (94% and 92.5%, respectively) in COVID-19 patients (n = 53), with 98% specificity in non-COVID-19 respiratory-disease (n = 98), and healthy-controls (n = 129). Anti S-RBD and N antibodies appeared five to ten days post-onset of symptoms, peaking at approximately four weeks. The appearance of IgG and IgM coincided while IgG subtypes, IgG1 and IgG3 appeared soon after the total IgG; IgG2 and IgG4 remained undetectable. Several inflammatory cytokines/chemokines were found to be elevated in many COVID-19 patients (e.g., Eotaxin, Gro-α, CXCL-10 (IP-10), RANTES (CCL5), IL-2Rα, MCP-1, and SCGF-b); CXCL-10 was elevated in all. In contrast to antibody titers, levels of CXCL-10 decreased with the improvement in patient health suggesting it as a candidate for disease resolution.

For many across Africa, compliance can be difficult. The aim of this study was to 1) understand the impact of student’s household’s ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, 2) identify predictors of mitigation strategy compliance, and 3) describe the impact of COVID-19 on household economics, food-security, and mental well-being. Materials and methods We conducted an email-based survey among current medical and pharmacy students of the University of Liberia College of Health Sciences between July and October 2020. The questionnaire was designed to explore their household’s ability to comply with current mitigation strategies, as well as the pandemic´s impact on the student’s household’s finances and food security. Descriptive statistics were used to delineate demographic characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model factors associated with ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, as well as participant’s food security. Results 113 persons responded to the questionnaire. Seventy-six (67∙3%) reported income losses as a result of the pandemic, with 93 (82∙3%) reporting being “somewhat” or “very worried” about their households’ finances. Seventy-seven (68∙1%) participants reported food stocks that were sufficient for one-week or less. Forty (35%) participants reported eating less preferred foods or skipping meals in the past week. Overall, 20 participants (19∙4%) had a positive depression screen. Conclusions Study participants showed mixed results in being able to adhere to national COVID-19 mitigation strategies, with household level stressors experienced around finances and food security. Until Liberia has access to vaccinations for most of its citizens, COVID-19 response measures need to provide social protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and which specifically targets food insecurity. Preventative interventions for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia’s response to the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3181600403,"Background Pakistan’s National AIDS Control Program has registered 44,000 HIV/AIDS patients to date, but the actual number of cases have been estimated to be as high as 150,000–170,000. The health care system has a very important role to play in this equation and must be reformed to improve the health care services in Pakistan, with regards to HIV/AIDS. Methods It was a qualitative research employing a phenomenological approach. The principal researcher visited nine public and private health care facilities and conducted 19 key informant interviews with people working for providing preventive and curative services, in addition to the observations made on the site. Results Pakistan’s health system has a limited capacity to address the HIV spread in the country, with its current resources. There is an obvious scarcity of resources at the preventive, diagnostic and curative level. However, menace can be curtailed through measures taken at the service delivery level by checking the unsafe needles practices, unclean surgical procedures and an unregulated and untrained private health workforce which are dangerous potentials routes of transmission of the virus to the general population. Healthcare establishments carry the chances of nosocomial infections including HIV/AIDS. Poverty, illiteracy and stigma associated with the disease is compounding the overall situation. Conclusion Improved accessibility to service delivery with a greater focus on prevention would be imperative to address the threat of HIV/AIDS in Pakistan. A health systems approach would help in identifying gaps at both strategic and operational levels, and concurrently find and implement solutions."

Infants and young children aged 2–59 months hospitalized with pneumonia were recruited. Serum blood samples were collected on admission and analyzed for total serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 concentrations using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a level of serum vitamin D &lt;50 nmol/L. The association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of hospitalized pneumonia according to WHO criteria, including the presence of danger signs, hypoxemia (SpO2 in air below 90%), duration of hospitalization, and admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU), was analyzed using logistic regression. Results 133 children with WHO-defined pneumonia were enrolled in the study and 127 (96%) had their vitamin D status determined.

Overt policies encouraging educators to adopt e-Learning and implement digital services coupled with the dramatic change in the education system in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19, has furthered the demand for evidence-based approaches for the planning and delivery of assessments. This study employed the Assessment Design Decision Framework (ADDF), a theoretical model that considers key aspects of assessment design, to retrospectively investigate from a multi-stakeholder perspective the assessments implemented following the rapid transition to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with faculty and students from the Colleges of Pharmacy, Medicine and Health Sciences. After inductive and deductive thematic analysis three major themes were identified. These reflected on the impact of sudden transition on assessment design and assessment plan; changing assessment environment; and faculty-student assessment related interactions which included feedback. The use of a comprehensive validated framework such as ADDF, to plan assessments can improve validity and credibility of assessments. The strengths of this study lie in the innovative adoption of the ADDF to evaluate assessment design decisions from both an educator and student perspective. Further, the data yielded from this study offers novel validation of the use of ADDF in circumstances necessitating rapid transition, and additionally identifies a need for greater emphasis to be attributed to the significance of timeliness of the various activities that are advocated within the framework."
https://openalex.org/W3178310059,"Background Monitoring changes of seroprevalence over time is important at the beginning and during of COVID-19 outbreak to anticipate its dynamics and plan an adequate public health response. Methods We conducted a repeated cross-sectional investigation among asymptomatic outpatient subjects and covered 0.1% of total population of Northern Serbia (Autonomous Province of Vojvodina). Each participant was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using an immunochromatographic qualitative test (point-of-care rapid test). In the last round of survey IgG antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed. Results During the four rounds of survey (between the end of April and the end of September), anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivities based on immunochromatographic test results were 2.60% (95% CI 1.80–3.63), 3.93% (95% CI 2.85–5.28), 6.11% (95% CI 4.72–7.77) and 14.60% (95% 12.51–16.89), respectively. After adjusting with results obtained from the Line immunoassay test, the estimated overall seroprevalence increased to 16.67% (95% CI 14.45–19.08) corresponding to 322,033 infections in total by the end of September 2020 in Vojvodina’s population. Throughout the course of the study, for every RT-PCR confirmed case of COVID-19, there were 39–87 additional infections in Vojvodina. No significant difference (p&gt;0.05) in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity regarding gender and between age subgroups was observed over the course of the survey. Conclusions The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies implies much more widespread infection in Vojvodina than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. However, our results suggest that the population of Vojvodina has not reached a desirable level of protection from SARS-CoV-2 virus by the end of September 2020."

We conducted a cross-sectional design study through a questionnaire survey with 443 respondents aged between 12 and 81 years. The questionnaire was concerned with previous health problem occurrences associated with thermal discomfort experiences, indoor environments, economic conditions, and basic anthropometric factors. Logistic regression with the odds ratio (OR) was applied to evaluate the tendency of different respondent groups to suffer from certain health problems, when compared to reference groups. Furthermore, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to incorporate certain factors (economic conditions, thermal discomfort experiences, and perceived indoor environments) into a single model to understand their direct and indirect effects on health conditions. The results indicate that economic conditions are the most significantly associated with health problems. Furthermore, we found that the low-income group was the most vulnerable to health problems, including coughing, puking, diarrhoea, odynophagia, headaches, fatigue, rheumatism, fidgeting, skin rashes, muscle cramps, and insomnia (OR: 1.94–6.04, p &lt;0.05). Additionally, the SEM suggested that the respondents’ economic conditions and thermal discomfort experiences had significant direct effects on their health problems with standardized estimates of -0.29 and 0.55, respectively. Additionally, perceived indoor environment quality, which is possible to cause thermal discomfort experience, indirectly affect health problems. These findings contribute an insightful and intuitive knowledge base which can aid health assessments associated with demographic and physical environments in developing sustainable and healthy environment strategies for the future."

The effect of intraoperative fluid balance and vasopressors on these complications is unknown. Materials and methods We conducted a cohort study between July 2008 and December 2017. Our exposure variables were the total intraoperative fluid balance and the use of vasopressors on ICU admission. Our primary outcome was any biliary complication (anastomotic and non-anastomotic strictures) up to one year after transplantation. Our secondary outcomes were vascular complications, primary graft non-function and survival. Results We included 562 consecutive liver transplantations. 192 (34%) transplants had a biliary complication, 167 (30%) had an anastomotic stricture and 56 had a non-anastomotic stricture (10%). We did not observe any effect of intraoperative fluid balance or vasopressor on biliary complications (HR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.02). A higher intraoperative fluid balance was associated with an increased risk of primary graft non-function (non-linear) and a lower survival (HR = 1.40, 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.71) in multivariable analyses. Conclusion Intraoperative fluid balance and vasopressors upon ICU admission were not associated with biliary complications after liver transplantation but may be associated with other adverse events. Intraoperative hemodynamic management must be prospectively studied to further assess their impact on liver recipients’ outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3182724930,"Isopeptide crosslinked proteins can be the product of transglutaminase or of exposure to organophosphorus toxicants (OP). Transglutaminase links glutamine to lysine with loss of ammonia. OP toxicants induce a link between glutamic acid and lysine with loss of water. Our goal was to establish criteria to distinguish real from false isopeptide crosslinks reported by software searches of mass spectrometry data. We used fragmentation spectra of tryptic peptides from MAP-rich tubulin Sus scrofa as a test system for detection of naturally-occurring isopeptide crosslinks. Data were analyzed with Protein Prospector. Criteria for the assignments included the presence of at least 1 crosslink specific product ion, fragment ions from both peptides, Protein Prospector scores ≥20, and best fit of the MS/MS data to the crosslinked peptide as opposed to a linear peptide. Out of 301,364 spectra, 15 potential transglutaminase-type crosslinked peptide candidates were identified. Manual evaluation of these MS/MS spectra reduced the number to 1 valid crosslink between Q112 of NFH and K368 of Tau. Immunopurification with anti-isopeptide 81D1C2 confirmed that MAP-rich tubulin contained only one isopeptide. Support for this isopeptide bond was obtained by showing that transglutaminase was capable of incorporating dansyl-aminohexyl -QQIV into K368. A model of the KIETHK-QLEAHNR isopeptide was synthesized with the aid of transglutaminase. MS/MS spectra of the model validated our interpretation of the native isopeptide. An OP-induced isopeptide bond between K163 of tubulin alpha-1A and E158 of tubulin beta-4B was induced by treating MAP-rich tubulin with 100 μM chlorpyrifos oxon. This crosslink was supported by the criteria described above and by the presence of diethoxyphospho-lysine 163 in the tubulin alpha-1A peptide. The information obtained in this work is valuable for future studies that aim to understand why exposure to OP is associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disease."

However, little is known about the relationship between resting heart rate and colorectal adenoma development. We aimed to investigate this association in a population who underwent screening colonoscopy. Methods Among 39,021 patients who underwent both electrocardiogram and screening colonoscopy during routine health examinations at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Health Promotion Center, Korea from January 2014 to July 2019, 1,344 patients had advanced adenoma. We performed 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching to establish a control group that mitigated the confounding effects of age and sex. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify the independent risk factors of advanced adenoma development. Results Resting heart rate was significantly higher in the advanced adenoma group than in the control group. The prevalence of advanced polyp increased across the quartiles of resting heart rate. Patients with higher resting heart rates were more likely to be older, smokers, and have increased blood pressure and DM and less likely to engage in active exercises than those with lower resting heart rates. Patients with higher resting heart rates had higher serum glucose, triglyceride, hemoglobin A1C, and insulin levels and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Patients with resting heart rate in the highest quartile (≥71 bpm) still showed significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of advanced adenoma development (OR: 1.379, 95% confidence interval: 1.099–1.731, p = 0.006).

We then exploited SPN priming to investigate independence of different symmetry representations. SPN priming did not survive changes in retinal location (Experiment 2, N = 48) or non-orthogonal changes in axis orientation (Experiment 3, N = 48). However, SPN priming transferred between vertical and horizontal axis orientations (Experiment 4, N = 48) and between reflectional and rotational symmetry (Experiment 5, N = 48). SPN priming is interesting in itself, and a useful new method for identifying functional boundaries of the symmetry response. We conclude that visual regularities at different retinal locations are coded independently. However, there is some overlap between different regularities presented at the same retinal location."

This study aims to compare the effectiveness between flipped classroom and live demonstration in transferring skills for fabricating Adams clasp. Forty third-year undergraduate dental students were assigned to two groups. The students in group LD (n = 20) attended a live demonstration while students in group FC (n = 20) attended a flipped classroom. Both groups were taught on skills to fabricate Adams clasp in a standardised way. Each student from both groups were asked to submit an Adams clasp for a blinded quality assessment by two trained and calibrated assessors using a 18-item rubric, followed by validated students’ satisfaction questionnaires to evaluate their perceived satisfaction on the teaching method received. A crossover study was then conducted three weeks later where LD attended a flipped classroom while FC attended a live demonstration. Students’ satisfaction questionnaires were again collected from each student for blinded analysis. Mean scores for the quality of Adams clasp were 9.775 and 9.125 for LD and FC, respectively. No significant difference was detected between the two groups. Statistically significant association was found for one statement on the questionnaire, “I found the classroom arrangements conducive for the wire-bending activity” (p = 0.010). No significant differences were found between the two groups for other statements (p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, within the limitations of the study, flipped classroom is equally effective as conventional live demonstration in transferring orthodontic wire-bending skills for fabrication of Adams clasp. However, students perceived the classroom arrangements during the flipped classroom significantly more conducive for teaching orthodontic wire-bending."
https://openalex.org/W3178185593,"Background Natural disasters are believed to be associated with cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to explore the changes in mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD) and their associations with natural disasters at the global level. Methods Country-specific data on the impact of natural disasters, rates of mortality due to IHD and years of life lost (YLL) and socioeconomic variables were obtained for 193 countries for the period from 1990 to 2017. An ecological trend study was conducted to estimate the changes in the IHD mortality and YLL rates and their associations with natural disasters (occurrence, casualties and total damage). Correlation analyses and multivariate linear regression were used. Results Significant changes were found in the IHD mortality and YLL rates and the occurrence of disasters between the two equal periods (1990 to 2003 and 2004 to 2017) (p&lt;0.001). The bivariate Pearson correlation test revealed that the trend in the occurrence of natural disasters was positively correlated with trends in the IHD mortality and YLL rates among females and all individuals (p&lt;0.05) and was marginally correlated among males. Multiple linear regression revealed an independent association between the occurrence of natural disasters and the IHD mortality rate among males, females and all individuals (standardized coefficients = 0.163, 0.357 and 0.241, p&lt;0.05), and similar associations were found for the YLL rate (standardized coefficients = 0.194, 0.233 and 0.189, p&lt;0.05). Conclusions Our study demonstrated significant changes in the IHD mortality and YLL rates at the global level and their independent associations with natural disasters. Both males and females were vulnerable to natural disasters. These results provide evidence that can be used to support policy making and resource allocation when responding to disasters and developing strategies to reduce the burden of IHD."
https://openalex.org/W3179934799,"Background Intestinal ischemia is a common complication with obscure pathophysiology in critically ill patients. Since insufficient delivery of oxygen is discussed, we investigated the influence of oxygen delivery, hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac index and the systemic vascular resistance index on the development of intestinal ischemia. Furthermore, we evaluated the predictive power of elevated lactate levels for the diagnosis of intestinal ischemia. Methods In a retrospective case-control study data (mean oxygen delivery, minimum oxygen delivery, systemic vascular resistance index) of critical ill patients from 02/2009–07/2017 were analyzed using a proportional hazard model. General model fit and linearity were tested by likelihood ratio tests. The components of oxygen delivery (hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation and cardiac index) were individually tested in models. Results 59 out of 874 patients developed intestinal ischemia. A mean oxygen delivery less than 250ml/min/m 2 (LRT vs. null model: p = 0.018; LRT for non-linearity: p = 0.012) as well as a minimum oxygen delivery less than 400ml/min/m 2 (LRT vs null model: p = 0.016; LRT for linearity: p = 0.019) were associated with increased risk of the development of intestinal ischemia. We found no significant influence of hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac index or systemic vascular resistance index. Receiver operating characteristics analysis for elevated lactate levels, pH, CO 2 and central venous saturation was poor with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.5324, 0.52, 0.6017 and 0.6786. Conclusion There was a significant correlation for mean and minimum oxygen delivery with the incidence of intestinal ischemia for values below 250ml/min/m 2 respectively 400ml/min/m 2 . Neither hemoglobin, arterial oxygen saturation, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance index nor elevated lactate levels could be identified as individual risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3181500142,"Although the global tobacco market of cigarillos is substantial, little is known about their particulate matter (PM) emissions. For exposure risk assessment of cigarillos, the PM fractions PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and PM 1 of eight cigarillo brands (four with filters) and a reference cigarette were measured. For this purpose, second-hand smoke was generated by an automatic smoke pump in a measuring chamber with a volume of 2.88 m³. The mean particle concentrations of the cigarillos ranged from 2783 μg/m³ to 6686 μg/m³ for PM 10 , from 2767 μg/m³ to 6585 μg/m³ for PM 2.5 , and from 2441 to 4680 μg/m³ for PM 1 . Mean concentrations of the reference cigarette for PM 10 , PM 2.5 , and PM 1 were 4400 μg/m³, 4335 μg/m³, and 3289 μg/m³, respectively. Filter-tipped cigarillos showed between 5% and 38% lower PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels, respectively, and between 4% and 30% lower PM 1 levels. Our findings show generally high PM emissions for all investigated tobacco products. Therefore, the declaration of PM amounts to government authorities should be mandatory for all tobacco products. Policymakers should ensure that corresponding information will be provided in the future."

https://openalex.org/W3179926383,"Aggressiveness of cancers, like prostate cancer, has been found to be associated with elevated expression of the microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). Here, we investigated whether KH176m (the active metabolite of sonlicromanol), a recently discovered selective mPGES-1 inhibitor, could affect prostate cancer cells-derived spheroid growth. We demonstrated that KH176m suppressed mPGES-1 expression and growth of DU145 (high mPGES-1 expression)-derived spheroids, while it had no effect on the LNCaP cell line, which has low mPGES-1 expression. By addition of exogenous PGE 2 , we found that the effect of KH176m on mPGES-1 expression and spheroid growth is due to the inhibition of a PGE 2 -driven positive feedback control-loop of mPGES-1 transcriptional regulation. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subset of cancer cells exhibiting the ability of self-renewal, plasticity, and initiating and maintaining tumor growth. Our data shows that mPGES-1 is specifically expressed in this CSCs subpopulation (CD44 + CD24 - ). KH176m inhibited the expression of mPGES-1 and reduced the growth of spheroids derived from the CSC. Based on the results obtained we propose selective mPGES-1 targeting by the sonlicromanol metabolite KH176m as a potential novel treatment approach for cancer patients with high mPGES-1 expression."

In this study, we clarified the correlation between ADA monitoring, including non-trough level, and real-world IBD clinical outcomes. This retrospective, observational, single-center study involved patients with ulcerative colitis (19) and Crohn’s disease (33) treated with ADA from January 2007 to August 2018. Serum ADA and AAA levels were measured 4‒14 days after ADA administration. The AAA positivity rate was 23.1% (12/52). ADA continuity was higher in AAA-negative patients than in AAA-positive patients ( P = 0.223). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a serum AAA cut-off of 9.2 μg/mL was associated with ADA continuity. The ADA level was significantly higher in the endoscopic remission group than in the non-remission group ( P = 0.02). Based on the ROC curve analysis results of serum ADA level and endoscopic remission, the cut-off value of the serum ADA level was set to 11.1 μg/mL. Under the combined use of ADA with immunomodulators and AAA positivity, ADA continuity was significantly higher when the serum AAA level at 4–14 days after ADA administration was ≥9.2 μg/mL. Furthermore, endoscopic remission can be expected with a serum ADA level of ≥11.1 μg/mL. Overall, to predict clinical outcomes, it would be useful to measure the blood level of ADA regardless of the timing of the trough."

https://openalex.org/W3179603344,"Akt/PKB is a kinase involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cell processes. Its activity is modulated by diverse post-translational modifications (PTMs). Particularly, conjugation of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) to this kinase impacts on multiple cellular functions, such as proliferation and splicing. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, this kinase is key for pluripotency maintenance. Among other functions, Akt is known to promote the expression of Nanog, a central pluripotency transcription factor (TF). However, the relevance of this specific PTM of Akt has not been previously analyzed in this context. In this work, we study the effect of Akt1 variants with differential SUMOylation susceptibility on the expression of Nanog. Our results demonstrate that both, the Akt1 capability of being modified by SUMO conjugation and a functional SUMO conjugase activity are required to induce Nanog gene expression. Likewise, we found that the common oncogenic E17K Akt1 mutant affected Nanog expression in ES cells also in a SUMOylatability dependent manner. Interestingly, this outcome takes places in ES cells but not in a non-pluripotent heterologous system, suggesting the presence of a crucial factor for this induction in ES cells. Remarkably, the two major candidate factors to mediate this induction, GSK3-β and Tbx3, are non-essential players of this effect, suggesting a complex mechanism probably involving non-canonical pathways. Furthermore, we found that Akt1 subcellular distribution does not depend on its SUMOylatability, indicating that Akt localization has no influence on the effect on Nanog, and that besides the membrane localization of E17K Akt mutant, SUMOylation is also required for its hyperactivity. Our results highlight the impact of SUMO conjugation in the function of a kinase relevant for a plethora of cellular processes, including the control of a key pluripotency TF."
https://openalex.org/W3180010235,"Introduction Women are under-represented in senior academic and hospital positions in many countries. The authors aim to assess the place and the evolution of all appointed female and male health practitioners’ working in French public Hospitals. Materials and methods Data of this observational study were collected from the National Management Centre (Centre National de Gestion) from 2015 up to January 1, 2020. First, the authors described demographic characteristics and specialties of all appointed medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry doctors’ working as Hospital Practitioners, Associate Professors, and Full Professors in French General and University-affiliated Hospitals in 2020. Then, they retrospectively reported the annual incidence of new entrance according to gender and professional status from 1999 to 2019 thanks to the appointment date of all practitioners in activity between 2015 and 2020. Results In 2020, 51 401 appointed practitioners (49.7% of female) were in activity in French public hospitals with a large majority being medical doctors (92.4%) compared to pharmacists (6%) and dentists (1.6%). Women represented 52.5% of the Hospital Practitioners, 48.6% of the Associate Professors, and 22.0% of the Full Professors (p &lt; 0.001). There were disparities between the rates of female Full Professors in medicine (20.6%), pharmacy (36.1%), and dentistry (44.3%, p &lt; 0.001). Women were appointed Hospital Practitioners and Associate Professors earlier than men (respectively 37.1 versus 38.8 years, p &lt; 0.001 and 36.1 versus 36.5 years, p = 0.04), and at a later age among Full Professors (43.7 versus 41.9 years, p &lt; 0.001). Compared to men, the annual proportion of appointed women varied significantly between 1999 and 2019 from 47.6% to 60.4% for Hospital Practitioners, from 50.0% to 44.6% for Associate Professors, and from 11.2% to 33.3% for Full Professors (p &lt; 0.001 for trend). Conclusions Although more and more women occupy positions in French hospitals, there is still a gender gap regarding access to Full Professor status in medicine and pharmacy, but not in dentistry. The disparity in numbers makes comparison difficult. Despite a trend towards gender equality during the last twenty years, it has not yet been achieved regarding access to the highest positions."
https://openalex.org/W3180679715,"In this paper we investigate the utility of one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in epidemiological forecasting. Deep learning models, in particular variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been studied for ILI (Influenza-Like Illness) forecasting, and have achieved a higher forecasting skill compared to conventional models such as ARIMA. In this study, we adapt two neural networks that employ one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers as a primary building block—temporal convolutional networks and simple neural attentive meta-learners—for epidemiological forecasting. We then test them with influenza data from the US collected over 2010-2019. We find that epidemiological forecasting with CNNs is feasible, and their forecasting skill is comparable to, and at times, superior to, plain RNNs. Thus CNNs and RNNs bring the power of nonlinear transformations to purely data-driven epidemiological models, a capability that heretofore has been limited to more elaborate mechanistic/compartmental disease models."

On the contrary, we propose a lognormal expansion that captures deviations from the lognormal distribution with additional terms that allow a better fit at the upper distribution tail, which is overestimated according to the lognormal distribution. As a consequence, concentration indexes should be addressed consistently with the lognormal expansion. Through a dynamic panel data approach, we also show that firm growth is persistent and highly dependent on firm characteristics, including size, age, and leverage −these results neglect Gibrat’s law for the Colombian case."

Materials and methods The canine GBM cell line J3T1 was subcutaneously injected into 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice to obtain tumour fragments. Tumour fragments were implanted into adult male mongrel dog brains through surgery. Multiparametric MRI was performed with conventional MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging at one week and two weeks after surgery in a total of 15 surgical success cases. The presence of tumour cells, the necrotic area fraction, and the microvessel density (MVD) of the tumour on the histologic specimen were assessed. Tumour volume, diffusion, and perfusion parameters were compared at each time point using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and the differences between tumour and normal parenchyma were compared using unpaired t-tests. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between the imaging and histologic parameters. Results All animals showed a peripheral enhancing lesion on MRI and confirmed the presence of a tumour through histologic analysis (92.3%). The normalized perfusion values did not show significant decreases through at least 2 weeks after the surgery ( P &gt; 0.05). There was greater cerebral blood volume and flow in the GBM than in the normal-appearing white matter (1.46 ± 0.25 vs. 1.13 ± 0.16 and 1.30 ± 0.22 vs. 1.02 ± 0.14; P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). The MVD in the histologic specimens was correlated with the cerebral blood volume in the GBM tissue (r = 0.850, P = 0.004). Conclusion Our results suggest that the canine GBM model showed perfusion imaging characteristics similar to those of humans, and it might have potential as a model to assess novel technical developments for GBM treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3180410158,"Background The guiding principle of many health care reforms is to overcome fragmentation of service delivery and work towards integrated healthcare systems. Even though the value of integration is well recognized, capturing its drivers and its impact as part of health system performance assessment is challenging. The main reason is that current assessment tools only insufficiently capture the complexity of integrated systems, resulting in poor impact estimations of the actions taken towards the ‘Triple Aim’. We describe the unique nature of simulation modeling to consider key health reform aspects: system complexity, optimization of actions, and long-term assessments. Research question How can the use and uptake of simulation models be characterized in the field of performance assessment of integrated healthcare systems? Methods A systematic search was conducted between 2000 and 2018, in 5 academic databases (ACM D. Library, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, Web of Science) complemented with grey literature from Google Scholar. Studies using simulation models with system thinking to assess system performance in topics relevant to integrated healthcare were selected for revision. Results After screening 2274 articles, 30 were selected for analysis. Five modeling techniques were characterized, across four application areas in healthcare. Complexity was defined in nine aspects, embedded distinctively in each modeling technique. ‘What if?’ &amp; ‘How to?’ scenarios were identified as methods for system optimization. The mean time frame for performance assessments was 18 years. Conclusions Simulation models can evaluate system performance emphasizing the complex relations between components, understanding the system’s adaptability to change in short or long-term assessments. These advantages position them as a useful tool for complementing performance assessment of integrated healthcare systems in their pursuit of the ‘Triple Aim’. Besides literacy in modeling techniques, accurate model selection is facilitated after identification and prioritization of the complexities that rule system performance. For this purpose, a tool for selecting the most appropriate simulation modeling techniques was developed."
https://openalex.org/W3181202499,"Inability to efficiently deal with emotionally laden situations, often leads to poor interpersonal interactions. This adversely affects the individual’s psychological functioning. A higher trait emotional intelligence (EI) is not only associated with psychological wellbeing, educational attainment, and job-related success, but also with willingness to seek professional and non-professional help for personal-emotional problems, depression and suicidal ideation. Thus, it is important to identify low (EI) individuals who are more prone to mental health problems than their high EI counterparts, and give them the appropriate EI training, which will aid in preventing the onset of various mood related disorders. Since people may be unaware of their level of EI/emotional skills or may tend to fake responses in self-report questionnaires in high stake situations, a system that assesses EI using physiological measures can prove affective. We present a multimodal method for detecting the level of trait Emotional intelligence using non-contact based autonomic sensors. To our knowledge, this is the first work to predict emotional intelligence level from physiological/autonomic (cardiac and respiratory) response patterns to emotions. Trait EI of 50 users was measured using Schutte Self Report Emotional Intelligence Test (SSEIT) along with their cardiovascular and respiratory data, which was recorded using FMCW radar sensor both at baseline and while viewing affective movie clips. We first examine relationships between users’ Trait EI scores and autonomic response and reactivity to the clips. Our analysis suggests a significant relationship between EI and autonomic response and reactivity. We finally attempt binary EI level detection using linear SVM. We also attempt to classify each sub factor of EI, namely–perception of emotion, managing own emotions, managing other’s emotions, and utilization of emotions. The proposed method achieves an EI classification accuracy of 84%, while accuracies ranging from 58 to 76% is achieved for recognition of the sub factors. This is the first step towards identifying EI of an individual purely through physiological responses. Limitation and future directions are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3180465372,"It is difficult for university hospitals to recruit and retain technically efficient surgeons because their missions include teaching and research as well as clinical services. The authors hypothesized that technically efficient surgeons do not continue to provide active clinical services in a university hospital. The authors collected data from all the surgical procedures performed at Teikyo University Hospital from April 1 through September 30 in 2013–2018. The dependent variable was defined as a length of each surgeon’s active clinical services measured by month. Data envelopment analysis was employed to calculate each surgeon’s technical efficiency score. Five control variables were selected; experience, medical school, surgical volume, gender, and academic ranks. Multiple regression analysis was performed. Efficiency scores had significantly negative association with length of active clinical services. Experience and surgical volume had significantly positive association with length of active clinical services. The other coefficients of control variables were insignificant. Technically efficient surgeons provide shorter active clinical services in a university hospital."
https://openalex.org/W3181311364,"Richard Ernst, professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), Nobel laureate, and groundbreaking scientist, died on 4 June. He was 87. By working at the interfaces between chemistry, physics, and biology, Ernst opened the door to magnetic resonance of materials, proteins, and nucleic acids. His work on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revolutionized medical diagnosis.

Born on 14 August 1933 and raised in Winterthur near Zurich, Switzerland, Ernst graduated with a diploma (BA) in chemistry from ETH Zurich, followed by a PhD from the same institution under the supervision of Hans Primas and Hans Gunthard. Except for a few years with Varian Associates in Palo Alto, California, he spent his entire career as a member of the ETH Zurich faculty. He had a rare talent for picking graduate students and postdoctoral associates, many of whom now hold faculty positions.

In 1945, physicists Felix Bloch at Stanford University and Edward M. Purcell at Harvard University discovered nuclear magnetic resonance in bulk matter by observing very weak signals that emanate from the nuclei of atoms, which possess magnetization like the needle of a compass. Ernst transformed magnetic resonance from an academic curiosity into a universal tool by making it possible to observe all nuclei in a molecule or a human body simultaneously rather than sequentially. The resulting signals can be analyzed by Fourier transformation, a mathematical operation that retrieves with clarity all frequencies in seemingly inextricable signals. Ernst developed methods to unravel signals that overlap in several dimensions, to correlate frequencies of different nuclei in a molecule, and to separate different spatial dimensions in a body. Simultaneous observation of all nuclei drastically improved the sensitivity of magnetic resonance. Information-rich images that are generated allow researchers and radiologists to observe all magnetic nuclei in a molecule or human body.

Ernst's breakthrough applies to work in a variety of fields. In biology, simultaneous observation of magnetic resonance signals allows the structure and dynamics of biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) to be determined in solution as well as in microcrystals, fibrils, sediments, and other solids. Magnetic resonance not only circumvents the need for obtaining crystals for diffraction but also opens the way to the study of the flexibility and structural adaptability of biomolecules. In materials science, simultaneous observation of magnetic resonance signals has been exploited with great success in batteries, catalysts, polymers, and porous materials of all sorts, as improved sensitivity makes it possible to determine the arrangement of atoms and ions in space and their ability to move around.



Ernst was honored as the sole recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1991, which coincided with the extravagantly celebrated 90th anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel and the 700th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation. Upon his return to Switzerland from Stockholm, Ernst was celebrated like a national hero, with spectacular fireworks and many television and radio interviews. He had mixed feelings about his award and the related celebrations, as he was well aware that others had paved the way for his success: Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield, who had made images of humans, and Weston Anderson, Jean Jeener, Ray Freeman, Kurt Wuthrich, and others, who had contributed to obtaining structures of molecules. Three of these scientists would be awarded Nobel Prizes in later years, but Ernst was disappointed that the others did not receive proper recognition.

Ernst also received the Marcel Benoist Prize in Switzerland, the Wolf Prize in Israel, and the first of more than a dozen honorary doctorates from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. His autobiography, Nobelpreistrager aus Winterthur (Nobel laureate from Winterthur), richly illustrated with works of Tibetan art that he collected, was published in German in 2020. An English translation will be released soon.

Ernst's influence went far beyond the field of physical chemistry. He was for many years one of the most cited Nobel laureates. As a guest speaker at universities around the world, especially after his retirement in 1998, he deftly associated science with other concerns, including Tibetan art and Buddhism. In his talks, he also expressed a biting criticism of university education, which he believed should focus on instilling a sense of responsibility beyond mere knowledge and technical skills, and he sharply denounced inequalities and injustice. His fiery speeches against the evils of US imperialism earned him the enmity of his critics.

The richness of Ernst's career reflects the complexity of the man. Always on the lookout for new methods to probe the secrets of matter, he also sought to unravel the mysteries of music and art. Even though he had given up playing Bach's cello suites because “his fingers did not obey his ear,” he continued to study intricate works of 18th-century composers. He also explored the Buddhist painting schools of Tibetan monasteries as well as the pantheon of deities represented on thangkas that he ardently collected.

I began working with Ernst as a postdoc in 1980. His support helped me earn the title of privatdozent before departing ETH Zurich in 1985. While there, I h elped him complete a book on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance that took many years to write. Owing in large part to Ernst's demanding sense of breadth and farsighted vision, the book continues to be widely cited as a reference for practitioners of magnetic resonance, even decades after its publication.

Along with his students and other collaborators, I appreciated Ernst's rigor, tinged with a certain stiffness; his incorruptible intransigence; and his oscillations between moods of arrogance and humility, forever unsatisfied and in search of balance. Like the spirits transmitted by reincarnation according to the Tibetan traditions that he admired so much, the spirit of this great scientist will undoubtedly enrich future generations."
https://openalex.org/W3181444235,"Neutrophils are recognized for their role in host defense against pathogens as well as inflammatory conditions mediated through many mechanisms including neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). NETs are increasingly appreciated as a major contributor in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a key neutrophil granule enzyme mediates generation of hypochlorous acid which, when extracellular, can cause host tissue damage. To better understand the role played by neutrophils in inflammatory diseases, we measured and modulated myeloperoxidase activity and NETs in vivo , utilizing a rat peritonitis model. RLS-0071 is a 15 amino acid peptide that has been shown to inhibit myeloperoxidase activity and NET formation in vitro . The rat model of inflammatory peritonitis was induced with intraperitoneal injection of either P . aeruginosa supernatant or immune-complexes. After euthanasia, a peritoneal wash was performed and measured for myeloperoxidase activity and free DNA as a surrogate for measurement of NETs. P . aeruginosa supernatant caused a 2-fold increase in MPO activity and free DNA when injected IP. Immune-complexes injected IP increased myeloperoxidase activity and free DNA 2- fold. RLS-0071 injection decreased myeloperoxidase activity and NETs in the peritoneal fluid generally to baseline levels in the presence of P . aeruginosa supernatant or immune-complexes. Taken together, RLS-0071 demonstrated the ability to inhibit myeloperoxidase activity and NET formation in vivo when initiated by different inflammatory stimuli including shed or secreted bacterial constituents as well as immune-complexes."
