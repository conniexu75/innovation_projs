https://openalex.org/W2810866092,"Proteins such as FUS phase separate to form liquid-like condensates that can harden into less dynamic structures. However, how these properties emerge from the collective interactions of many amino acids remains largely unknown. Here, we use extensive mutagenesis to identify a sequence-encoded molecular grammar underlying the driving forces of phase separation of proteins in the FUS family and test aspects of this grammar in cells. Phase separation is primarily governed by multivalent interactions among tyrosine residues from prion-like domains and arginine residues from RNA-binding domains, which are modulated by negatively charged residues. Glycine residues enhance the fluidity, whereas glutamine and serine residues promote hardening. We develop a model to show that the measured saturation concentrations of phase separation are inversely proportional to the product of the numbers of arginine and tyrosine residues. These results suggest it is possible to predict phase-separation properties based on amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2810097927,"Knowledge of immune cell phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment is essential for understanding mechanisms of cancer progression and immunotherapy response. We profiled 45,000 immune cells from eight breast carcinomas, as well as matched normal breast tissue, blood, and lymph nodes, using single-cell RNA-seq. We developed a preprocessing pipeline, SEQC, and a Bayesian clustering and normalization method, Biscuit, to address computational challenges inherent to single-cell data. Despite significant similarity between normal and tumor tissue-resident immune cells, we observed continuous phenotypic expansions specific to the tumor microenvironment. Analysis of paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing data from 27,000 additional T cells revealed the combinatorial impact of TCR utilization on phenotypic diversity. Our results support a model of continuous activation in T cells and do not comport with the macrophage polarization model in cancer. Our results have important implications for characterizing tumor-infiltrating immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W2805619986,"Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies suffer from many sources of technical noise, including under-sampling of mRNA molecules, often termed “dropout,” which can severely obscure important gene-gene relationships. To address this, we developed MAGIC (Markov affinity-based graph imputation of cells), a method that shares information across similar cells, via data diffusion, to denoise the cell count matrix and fill in missing transcripts. We validate MAGIC on several biological systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover regulatory relations without perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2811453513,"Cerebral cortex size differs dramatically between reptiles, birds, and mammals, owing to developmental differences in neuron production. In mammals, signaling pathways regulating neurogenesis have been identified, but genetic differences behind their evolution across amniotes remain unknown. We show that direct neurogenesis from radial glia cells, with limited neuron production, dominates the avian, reptilian, and mammalian paleocortex, whereas in the evolutionarily recent mammalian neocortex, most neurogenesis is indirect via basal progenitors. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mouse, chick, and snake embryos and in human cerebral organoids demonstrate that high Slit/Robo and low Dll1 signaling, via Jag1 and Jag2, are necessary and sufficient to drive direct neurogenesis. Attenuating Robo signaling and enhancing Dll1 in snakes and birds recapitulates the formation of basal progenitors and promotes indirect neurogenesis. Our study identifies modulation in activity levels of conserved signaling pathways as a primary mechanism driving the expansion and increased complexity of the mammalian neocortex during amniote evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2810745432,"Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) is the canonical type I viral envelope glycoprotein and provides a template for the membrane-fusion mechanisms of numerous viruses. The current model of HA-mediated membrane fusion describes a static spring-loaded fusion domain (HA2) at neutral pH. Acidic pH triggers a singular irreversible conformational rearrangement in HA2 that fuses viral and cellular membranes. Here, using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)-imaging, we directly visualized pH-triggered conformational changes of HA trimers on the viral surface. Our analyses reveal reversible exchange between the pre-fusion and two intermediate conformations of HA2. Acidification of pH and receptor binding shifts the dynamic equilibrium of HA2 in favor of forward progression along the membrane-fusion reaction coordinate. Interaction with the target membrane promotes irreversible transition of HA2 to the post-fusion state. The reversibility of HA2 conformation may protect against transition to the post-fusion state prior to arrival at the target membrane."

While quantitative models can predict RNA secondary structure stability, we are still unable to predict the thermodynamic stability of RNA tertiary structure. Here, we probe conformational preferences of diverse RNA two-way junctions to develop a predictive model for the formation of RNA tertiary structure. We quantitatively measured tertiary assembly energetics of >1,000 of RNA junctions inserted in multiple structural scaffolds to generate a ""thermodynamic fingerprint"" for each junction. Thermodynamic fingerprints enabled comparison of junction conformational preferences, revealing principles for how sequence influences 3-dimensional conformations. Utilizing fingerprints of junctions with known crystal structures, we generated ensembles for related junctions that predicted their thermodynamic effects on assembly formation. This work reveals sequence-structure-energetic relationships in RNA, demonstrates the capacity for diverse compensation strategies within tertiary structures, and provides a path to quantitative modeling of RNA folding energetics based on ""ensemble modularity."""
https://openalex.org/W2811414439,"The DNA-binding protein REST forms complexes with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to repress neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells. In differentiating neurons, REST is downregulated predominantly by transcriptional silencing. Here we report that post-transcriptional inactivation of REST by alternative splicing is required for hearing in humans and mice. We show that, in the mechanosensory hair cells of the mouse ear, regulated alternative splicing of a frameshift-causing exon into the Rest mRNA is essential for the derepression of many neuronal genes. Heterozygous deletion of this alternative exon of mouse Rest causes hair cell degeneration and deafness, and the HDAC inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) rescues the hearing of these mice. In humans, inhibition of the frameshifting splicing event by a novel REST variant is associated with dominantly inherited deafness. Our data reveal the necessity for alternative splicing-dependent regulation of REST in hair cells, and they identify a potential treatment for a group of hereditary deafness cases."
https://openalex.org/W2811090861,"Background The high burden of chronic communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and an escalating rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Malawi and other sub-Saharan African countries, calls for a shift in how health care services are designed and delivered. Patient-centred care and patient self-management are critical elements in chronic care, and are advocated as universal strategies. In sub-Saharan Africa, there is need for more evidence around the practice of patient self-management, and how to best support patients with chronic conditions in the African context. Our study explored self-management practices of patients with different chronic conditions, and their strategies to overcome care challenges in a resource-constrained setting in Malawi. Methods This is primarily a qualitative study, involving patients with different chronic conditions from one rural district in Malawi. Data are drawn from semi-structured questions of a survey with 129 patients (from the third of four-part data collection series), 14 in-depth interviews, and four focus-group discussions with patients (n = 31 respondents). A framework approach was used for qualitative analysis, and descriptive statistical analysis was performed on survey data. Results Patients demonstrated ability to self-manage their conditions, though this varied between conditions, and was influenced by individual and external factors. Factors included: 1) ability to acquire appropriate disease knowledge; 2) poverty level; 3) the presence of support from family caregivers and community-based support initiatives; 4) the nature of one’s social relations; and 5) the ability to deal with stressors and stigma. NCD and HIV comorbid patients were more disadvantaged in their access to care, as they experienced frequent drug stock-outs and incurred additional costs when referred. These barriers contributed to delayed care, poorer treatment adherence, and likelihood of poorer treatment outcomes. Patients proved resourceful and made adjustments in the face of (multiple) care challenges. Conclusion Our findings complement other research on self-management experiences in chronically ill patients with its analysis on factors and barriers that influence patient self-management capacity in a resource-constrained setting. We recommend expanding current peer-patient and support group initiatives to patients with NCDs, and further investments in the decentralisation of integrated health services to primary care level in Malawi."

Although vaccination is potentially one of the most effective methods to control GAS infection and its sequelae, few prototype vaccines have been investigated in humans. In this study, we report the safety and immunogenicity of a novel acetylated peptide-protein conjugate vaccine candidate MJ8VAX (J8-DT), when delivered intramuscularly to healthy adults. Methods A randomized, double-blinded, controlled Phase I clinical trial was conducted in 10 healthy adult participants. Participants were randomized 4:1 to receive the vaccine candidate (N = 8) or placebo (N = 2). A single dose of the vaccine candidate (MJ8VAX), contained 50 μg of peptide conjugate (J8-DT) adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide and re-suspended in PBS in a total volume of 0.5 mL. Safety of the vaccine candidate was assessed by monitoring local and systemic adverse reactions following intramuscular administration. The immunogenicity of the vaccine was assessed by measuring the levels of peptide (anti-J8) and toxoid carrier (anti-DT)—specific antibodies in serum samples. Results No serious adverse events were reported over 12 months of study. A total of 13 adverse events (AEs) were recorded, two of which were assessed to be associated with the vaccine. Both were mild in severity. No local reactogenicity was recorded in any of the participants. MJ8VAX was shown to be immunogenic, with increase in vaccine-specific antibodies in the participants who received the vaccine. The maximum level of vaccine-specific antibodies was detected at 28 days post immunization. The level of these antibodies decreased with time during follow-up. Participants who received the vaccine also had a corresponding increase in anti-DT serum antibodies. Conclusions Intramuscular administration of MJ8VAX was demonstrated to be safe and immunogenic. The presence of DT in the vaccine formulation resulted in a boost in the level of anti-DT antibodies. Trial registration ACTRN12613000030774"
https://openalex.org/W2810978155,"Parkinson's disease is mainly a sporadic disorder in which both environmental and cellular factors play a major role in the initiation of this disease. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are integral components of the extracellular matrix and are known to influence amyloid aggregation of several proteins, including α-synuclein (α-Syn). However, the mechanism by which different GAGs and related biological polymers influence protein aggregation and the structure and intercellular spread of these aggregates remains elusive. In this study, we used three different GAGs and related charged polymers to establish their role in α-Syn aggregation and associated biological activities of these aggregates. Heparin, a representative GAG, affected α-Syn aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas biphasic α-Syn aggregation kinetics was observed in the presence of chondroitin sulfate B. Of note, as indicated by 2D NMR analysis, different GAGs uniquely modulated α-Syn aggregation because of the diversity of their interactions with soluble α-Syn. Moreover, subtle differences in the GAG backbone structure and charge density significantly altered the properties of the resulting amyloid fibrils. Each GAG/polymer facilitated the formation of morphologically and structurally distinct α-Syn amyloids, which not only displayed variable levels of cytotoxicity but also exhibited an altered ability to internalize into cells. Our study supports the role of GAGs as key modulators in α-Syn amyloid formation, and their distinct activities may regulate amyloidogenesis depending on the type of GAG being up- or down-regulated in vivo.

Heparin and other glycosaminoglycans stimulate the formation of amyloid fibrils from α-synuclein in vitro.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (11814343): 1502-151110.1021/bi011711sCrossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 37Bourgault S.

One of the most studied glycosaminoglycans, heparin, is known to promote the formation of aggregation-competent Tau dimers, which is a critical rate-limiting step of Tau aggregation (38Ramachandran G.

Moreover, GAGs are also known to interact with positively charged regions of proteins and facilitate their aggregation into amyloids associated with either disease onset or protective functions (22Valle-Delgado J.J.

Remarkably, Lewy body deposits contain heparan sulfate proteoglycans (41Perry G. Richey P. Siedlak S.L. Galloway P. Kawai M. Cras P. Basic fibroblast growth factor binds to filamentous inclusions of neurodegenerative diseases.Brain Res. 1992; 579 (1628222): 350-35210.1016/0006-8993(92)90074-JCrossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and chondroitin sulfates (42DeWitt D.A.

This co-accumulation or colocalization of GAGs with α-Syn amyloid deposits suggests the involvement of GAGs in mediating protein fibrillation. Holmes et al. (43Holmes B.B. DeVos S.L. Kfoury N. Li M.

However, the influence of GAGs on α-Syn aggregation and its associated biological activities remains elusive. In addition, how various GAGs with a different degree of sulfation/backbone affect the pathway(s) of α-Syn fibrillation and structure/functions of the resultant fibrils remains unexplored so far. Here, we used three different GAGs and related polysaccharide/polymers to delineate how different GAGs influence the α-Syn aggregation pathway(s) as well as the structure/activities of resultant fibrils. The in vitro aggregation of α-Syn in the presence of GAGs demonstrates that each GAG and related polymers uniquely modulate α-Syn amyloid formation. α-Syn in the presence of GAGs produced morphologically different and less or nontoxic amyloid fibrils, which also exhibited altered internalization ability in cells. Using two-dimensional (2D) NMR, we studied GAG–protein interactions and showed that each GAG interacts with soluble α-Syn uniquely in a residue-specific manner. These GAGs also interact differentially with preformed fibrils and alter the fibrillar secondary structural composition. Overall, the present study helps to delineate the role of GAGs and related polymers as modulators in amyloid formation associated with PD and other amyloid-related diseases. To explore the interaction mechanism of GAGs with α-Syn and their role in aggregation, we used different GAGs and related polymers including heparin (Hep), chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), chondroitin sulfate B (CSB), dextran sulfate (Dext), chitosan, and polyvinyl sulfate (PVS) polymer. The chemical structure of these GAGs consists of a disaccharide-repeating unit of amino sugar moieties and uronic acid with different degrees of sulfation (Fig. 1A). We sought to understand how the chemical structure, backbone, and orientation of the functional groups of GAGs modulate α-Syn aggregation and its resultant fibril properties. For instance, we used CSA and CSB, which have identical chemical formulas and similar structure, except for the orientation of the 6′-COOH group of the disaccharide-repeating unit, which is equatorial and axial in the case of CSA and CSB, respectively. To study the importance of the electrostatic interaction and the negatively charged sulfate group, chitosan, a positively charged carbohydrate polymer, was also included in this study. Further, PVS, which contains a long hydrocarbon chain of sulfate groups but lacks sugar backbone, was used to probe the significance of the amino sugar backbone of sulfated polymers. Of note, all of the GAGs under study contain a higher density of sulfate groups compared with the heparan sulfate found in the Lewy bodies. To investigate the effect of GAG concentration on α-Syn aggregation, four different molar ratios of protein and GAGs were used. The molar ratios of protein:GAG were 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2, which we termed GAG 0.25, GAG 0.5, GAG 1, and GAG 2, respectively. We expressed and purified recombinant α-Syn and assessed the protein purity using SDS-PAGE analysis and MALDI-TOF spectrometry (Fig. S1). For the aggregation reaction, 300 μm low-molecular-weight (LMW) protein (prepared as described under “Experimental procedures”), which contains mostly monomeric α-Syn (44Ghosh D. Mondal M. Mohite G.M. Singh P.K. Ranjan P. Anoop A. Ghosh S. Jha N.N. Kumar A. Maji S.K. The Parkinson's disease-associated H50Q mutation accelerates α-Synuclein aggregation in vitro.Biochemistry. 2013; 52 (24047453): 6925-692710.1021/bi400999dCrossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), was incubated with GAGs/polymers at the molar ratios described above. α-Syn alone was also incubated as a control. The protein samples were incubated at 37 °C with slight agitation, and a thioflavin T (ThT)–binding assay was performed at regular time intervals. ThT binding to amyloids generally follows a sigmoidal growth curve consisting of three distinct phases: (i) lag phase (very low ThT fluorescence), where proteins slowly associate to form an aggregation-competent nuclei; (ii) growth phase (rapid increase in ThT fluorescence), where the oligomeric nucleus gradually grows into fibrils; and (iii) stationary phase (ThT fluorescence becomes saturated), where fibril formation is completed and it remains in equilibrium with the monomeric protein. The sigmoidal growth curves obtained were fitted, and lag time was calculated using previously described equations (45Willander H. Presto J. Askarieh G. Biverstål H. Frohm B. Knight S.D. Johansson J. Linse S. BRICHOS domains efficiently delay fibrillation of amyloid β-peptide.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287 (22801430): 31608-3161710.1074/jbc.M112.393157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The ThT fluorescence of α-Syn alone showed a sigmoidal growth curve with a lag time of 68 ± 3 h. At low concentrations, Hep 0.25 and 0.5 accelerated α-Syn aggregation with lag times of 15 ± 5 and 39 ± 3 h, respectively. However, Hep at higher concentrations (Hep 1 and Hep 2) delayed the α-Syn aggregation with lag times of 85 ± 5.5 and 91 ± 9.8 h, respectively (Fig. 1, Hep). In contrast to Hep, other GAGs accelerated the rate of α-Syn aggregation upon increase in their concentration (Fig. 1). Along with ThT-binding assay, the time-dependent structural transition was also monitored by circular dichroism (CD) (Fig. S2). At the beginning of incubation, α-Syn in the absence and presence of GAGs showed a random coil structure and subsequently got converted to β-sheet structure at the end of the aggregation (Fig. S2). To trace the structural transition and formation of β-sheet, we plotted CD intensity at θ218 nm (specific for β-sheet) with time. Intensity at 218 nm increased with the incubation time for all the samples, indicating time-dependent β-sheet formation (Fig. S3). Also, we calculated the relative percentage of the secondary structures formed during the aggregation by CD deconvolution using CDPro software (46Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Estimation of protein secondary structure from circular dichroism spectra: Comparison of CONTIN, SELCON, and CDSSTR methods with an expanded reference set.Anal.

The data showed time-dependent disappearance of the random coil structure and appearance of the β-sheet. To examine the effect of a positively charged GAG/polymer on α-Syn aggregation, we studied α-Syn aggregation in the presence of chitosan. Similar to other GAGs, chitosan also resulted in faster aggregation kinetics. Although at the beginning of the incubation, ThT fluorescence increased rapidly, after some time, it formed a gel-like state that impeded our further measurement of ThT fluorescence (data not shown) and CD spectroscopy. However, at the end of the aggregation, we diluted and redissolved the gel in a higher volume of 20 mm Gly-NaOH buffer, pH 7.4 (containing 0.01% sodium azide) by vortexing. We recorded the CD spectra on day 10, where we found the presence of a β-sheet structure (Fig. S5). We further tested the effect of PVS and observed that it accelerated α-Syn aggregation rapidly. α-Syn at 300 μm concentration incubated with PVS formed a β-sheet almost instantaneously and showed very high ThT binding to α-Syn aggregates. Therefore, using this high protein concentration (300 μm), it was difficult to follow aggregation kinetics in the presence of PVS. Hence, we incubated 10 μm α-Syn in the presence of different molar ratios of PVS. At a low molar ratio of PVS (PVS 0.25), no increment in ThT was observed even after 6000 min of incubation (Fig. 1B, PVS). Although in the case of PVS 0.5 and PVS 1, α-Syn showed nucleation-dependent polymerization, the aggregation rate was significantly higher compared to all other GAGs under study, despite the low α-Syn concentration used for PVS-mediated aggregation. In addition, PVS 2 completely eliminated the lag phase of aggregation, and after 10 min of incubation, it reached a plateau phase (Fig. 1B, PVS). Taken together, all GAGs except heparin increased the aggregation rate of α-Syn with an increase in their concentrations. Heparin at low molar ratios (Hep 0.25 and 0.5) accelerated α-Syn aggregation, whereas at higher molar ratios (Hep 1 and 2), it delayed the aggregation process. To probe whether the nucleation of α-Syn aggregation is delayed at a high molar ratio of Hep, we performed static light scattering at 450 nm and time-dependent atomic force microscopy (AFM) during aggregation in the presence of Hep 0.25 and Hep 2 (Fig. 2, A and B). Static light scattering data (similar to ThT fluorescence kinetics) revealed that heparin at high concentrations (Hep 2) exhibited a longer lag phase compared to α-Syn alone and Hep 0.25 (Fig. 1). Time-dependent morphological analysis by AFM showed that oligomer formation was delayed in the case of Hep 2 compared to both α-Syn control and Hep 0.25 (Fig. 2, A and B). The inability of α-Syn to attain spontaneous nucleation in the presence of Hep was further confirmed by the addition of sonicated preformed fibrils (1 and 2% seed) into the α-Syn-Hep 2 reaction mixture after ∼65 h of incubation. In the presence of seeds, a rapid increase in ThT binding was observed for α-Syn aggregation in the presence of Hep 2 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the present data convincingly establish that higher concentration of Hep inhibits α-Syn aggregation by preventing the formation of the aggregation-competent oligomeric nucleus. Intriguingly, this phenomenon was observed only for heparin, and the trend was not observed for other GAGs under study. However, it is not clear at this point as to why this mechanism is unique only for heparin. It conceivably could be because its distinct backbone with negative charge density/distribution might influence α-Syn aggregation uniquely. In the presence of CSB, the aggregation kinetics measured by ThT fluorescence showed three-state transitions, unlike other GAGs, which showed two-state kinetics (Figs. 1B, CSB, and 2D). It is possible that CSB stabilizes the aggregation intermediate in the middle of the kinetics observed as a temporary plateau phase, which eventually converts into fibrils. As shown in Fig. 2D, the CD data for this intermediate showed the presence of a stabilized helix-rich intermediate (48Ghosh D. Singh P.K. Sahay S"

Much of the increase is expected in developing countries. The fastest growth in the elderly population is taking place in China, India, and their south Asian and western Pacific neighbors. AD is the only top 10 cause of death that cannot eventually be prevented, cured, or even slowed down. Between 2000 and 2014, deaths from AD as recorded on death certificates increased 89%, whereas deaths from the number one cause of death (heart disease) decreased by 14%. Among people aged 70 or older, 61% of those with AD are expected to die before the age of 80 as compared with 30% of people without AD (2Mattson M.P. Carney J.W. Butterfield D.A.

The main components of the amyloid deposits that accumulate extracellularly are the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are generated by a double proteolytic event by the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (6Goate A.M.

A key feature observed in AD patients is the presence of nonenzymatic protein glycation, because it affects long-living proteins throughout the body (9Culberson J.W. Clinical aspects of glucose metabolism and chronic disease.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2017; 146 (28253982): 1-1110.1016/bs.pmbts.2016.12.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein glycation, which differs from the enzyme-assisted glycosylation, starts with the condensation of a protein amino group with glucose to yield a Schiff base, which undergoes a rearrangement to form so-called Amadori reaction compounds (10Ulrich P.

Subsequently, these species evolve by decomposition, fragmentation, and condensation and yield a widely heterogeneous set of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Glucose and other products lead to auto-oxidation reactions, which are responsible for free radicals and highly reactive carbonyl compound production. These compounds can react, in a protein, with specific groups and contribute to post-translational modifications (10Ulrich P. Cerami A. Protein glycation, diabetes, and aging.Recent Prog. Horm.

Despite this evidence, the molecular mechanism through which glycation might influence the tendency to develop AD remains enigmatic. Glycation seems to affect the aggregation properties of polypeptides unevenly; some proteins are stimulated to aggregate by glycation, whereas glycation slows down the process for other proteins (for an exhaustive review, see Iannuzzi et al. (20Iannuzzi C. Irace G. Sirangelo I. Differential effects of glycation on protein aggregation and amyloid formation.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2014; 1 (25988150): 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). Different glycation agents can also affect proteins in different ways. Preliminary studies on the effects of glycation on Aβ have confirmed a complex scenario also for this protein. Various researchers have suggested that glycation increases the speed and the aggregate size of Aβ self-assembly (11Wolf J. Vítek M. Herrendörfer G. Sumpf D.

However, pretreatment of Aβ42 with glucose, fructose, and the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate B was shown to inhibit Aβ42-induced apoptosis and reduce neurotoxicity in neuroblastoma cells (23Fernàndez-Busquets X.

The fibrillary aggregates formed upon glycation were also not cytotoxic, suggesting that glycation of Aβ could reduce its toxicity rather than increasing it. Here, we have reconsidered the problem and addressed the effect of glycation on the two main Aβ peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) using an in vitro approach based on complementary biophysical techniques. We selected as glycation agent methylglyoxal (MGO), a by-product of the interconversion between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. MGO is a dicarbonyl metabolite that forms through multiple catabolic processes (24Reichard Jr., G.A. Skutches C.L. Hoeldtke R.D. Owen O.E.

We demonstrated that, as opposed to the process observed with glucose and fructose, MGO significantly slows down formation of the mature fibers while still allowing protein aggregation and without drastically changing the morphology of the aggregates (13Li X.H. Du L.L. Cheng X.S. Jiang X. Zhang Y. Lv B.L. Liu R. Wang J.Z. Zhou X.W.

We first explored by systematically screening the effects of buffer, pH, and ionic strength on the kinetics of glycation and self-assembly to find conditions in which aggregation would be sufficiently slow to follow the glycation process using peptides synthesized in house and previously extensively characterized (31Crescenzi O. Tomaselli S. Guerrini R. Salvadori S. D'Ursi A.M. Temussi P.A. Picone D. Solution structure of the Alzheimer amyloid β-peptide (1–42) in an apolar microenvironment: similarity with a virus fusion domain.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269 (12423364): 5642-564810.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03271.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Optimal conditions for the reaction were found using 200 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, to have a polar environment in which the Aβ peptides are known to quickly aggregate and adopt a β-conformation (32Emendato A. Spadaccini R. De Santis A. Guerrini R. D'Errico G. Picone D. Preferential interaction of the Alzheimer peptide Aβ-(1–42) with Ω-3-containing lipid bilayers: structure and interaction studies.FEBS Lett. 2016; 590 (26821608): 582-59110.1002/1873-3468.12082Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The peptides were always pretreated under strong acidic conditions (TFA) for 1 h and freeze-dried to remove the volatile acid. This protocol allows dissolving possible aggregates and thus better reproducibility between experiments. We found that optimal peptide concentrations for following kinetics within reasonable time were 100 μm. After pretreatment, the peptides were dissolved in phosphate buffer and divided into two identical aliquots, which were incubated at 37 °C in the presence and in the absence of MGO (as a control). After optimization, we found that the addition of a 100-fold excess of MGO (10 mm final concentration) was necessary to obtain efficient glycation. The vast excess of MGO may not be physiologic but was used to speed up an intrinsically slow reaction (33Thornalley P. Dicarbonyl intermediates in the maillard reaction.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1043 (16037229): 111-11710.1196/annals.1333.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and to be able to observe effects in a reasonable time span. Aβ peptides contain an arginine in the fifth N-terminal position, which has been observed to be glycated in Aβ40 and in its fragments (34Fica-Contreras S.M. Shuster S.O. Durfee N.D. Bowe G.J.K. Henning N.J. Hill S.A. Vrla G.D. Stillman D.R. Suralik K.M. Sandwick R.K. Choi S.

Among the possible products, argpyrimidine is the only AGE product that fluoresces at this wavelength (35Beisswenger P.J. Howell S. Mackenzie T. Corstjens H. Muizzuddin N. Matsui M.S. Two Fluorescent Wavelengths, 440ex/520em nm and 370ex/440em nm, reflect advanced glycation and oxidation end products in human skin without diabetes.Diabetes Technol. Ther. 2012; 14 (22023375): 285-29210.1089/dia.2011.0108Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other potential products, such as modifications of Lys-16, do not have appreciable fluorescence emission. Glycation could thus be followed by monitoring formation of the fluorescent argpyriminide product resulting from the glycation reaction, measuring the emission spectra in the range 370–550 nm, upon excitation at 340 nm, following the procedure described by Praveen et al. (36Pampati P.K. Suravajjala S. Dain J.A. Monitoring nonenzymatic glycation of human immunoglobulin G by methylglyoxal and glyoxal: a spectroscopic study.Anal. Biochem. 2011; 408 (20816660): 59-6310.1016/j.ab.2010.08.038Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An intense fluorescence signal with the maximum centered at 400 nm was observed for the glycated Aβ40 peptide (Aβ40G) (Fig. 1A). The fluorescence intensity, and therefore the argpyrimidine concentration, eventually reached a plateau (Fig. 1B). As a reference, nonglycated Aβ40 (Aβ40NG) does not have considerable fluorescence under the same conditions, and MGO has an intrinsic fluorescence signal upon excitation at a different wavelength (data not shown). The same experimental procedure was adopted to follow glycation on the longer and more aggregation-prone amyloid peptide Aβ42. Also in this case, the sample was split in two aliquots, and 10 mm MGO was added to only one of them (samples hereafter indicated as Aβ42G and Aβ42NG for glycated and nonglycated Aβ42, respectively). AGE products formed by Aβ42 had a different behavior with respect to Aβ40. During the reaction, there was a progressive increase of the fluorescence signal upon excitation at 340 nm, but the emission maximum was red-shifted as compared with the shorter peptide and centered at 430 nm (Fig. 2A). This behavior could reflect a different end product or a different conformation of Aβ42. The reaction was also slower than that observed for Aβ40 and reached a plateau after approximately 1 week (Fig. 2B). A slower glycation reaction for Aβ42 could be expected, because the glycation sites will reasonably be less accessible because this peptide is more aggregation-prone than Aβ40. It has recently been described that only two of the four potential glycating groups can be glycated by MGO in Aβ40 and its shorter fragments (34Fica-Contreras S.M. Shuster S.O. Durfee N.D. Bowe G.J.K. Henning N.J. Hill S.A. Vrla G.D. Stillman D.R. Suralik K.M. Sandwick R.K. Choi S. Glycation of Lys-16 and Arg-5 in amyloid-β and the presence of Cu2+ play a major role in the oxidative stress mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.J. Biol. Inorg.

Although chromatographic approaches are not the most suitable technique to perform an accurate quantitative evaluation of the differently modified Aβ42 species, the chemico-physical characteristics of these specific peptides make chromatographic techniques hard to use for the analysis of the undigested amyloid peptides: Aβ42 is too sticky and tends to interact strongly with the stationary phase. This results in a low yield and a low chromatographic resolution. The situation could be different for the glycated peptide, but this would, per se, invalidate the analysis because the quantification could enrich only one of the different species formed. On the other hand, chromatography has widely been used for semiquantitative comparisons between very similar compounds. In this light, the intensity of the signals observed in the MALDI spectra for two compounds differing only by the presence of a small group can provide reliable semiquatitative information on their relative abundance. After incubation of the peptide with MGO in phosphate buffer for 10 days, we observed three main species in addition to the unreacted peptide (Fig. 3A). The signal at m/z 4584.5 (mass increment of 72 Da as compared with the unmodified peptide) was presumably generated by a reaction involving the peptide N terminus or the ϵ-amine group of a lysine residue (37Lapolla A. Fedele D. Seraglia R. Traldi P. The role of mass spectrometry in the study of non-enzymatic protein glycation in diabetes: an update.Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2006; 25 (16625652): 775-79710.1002/mas.20090Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (note that the difference of one mass unit between the values cited here and the figure is due to the isotopic pattern). The ion at m/z 4592.5 (mass increment of 80 Da) indicated the formation of an argpyrimidine, as expected from the glycation of Arg-5. A minor species at m/z 4664.6 (mass increment of 152 Da) was also observed, which could correspond to the doubly modified peptide. To confirm these results and identify the modified amino acidic residues, the peptide was subjected to overnight trypsin digestion, and the fragments were analyzed by high-resolution LC-MS. Seven main species were detected (Table 1). The molecular weight of four fragments corresponded to those expected for the unmodified peptides, confirming digestion efficacy. Species with a molecular weight of 2033.903, 2714.259, and 3412.644 (Fig. 3B) were observed, corresponding to residues 1–16 with an argpyrimidine (theoretical weight 2033.894), fragment 6–28 with an N-(carboxyethyl)-lysine (theoretical weight 2714.314), and fragment 1–28 with both modifications (theoretical weight 3412.634). The identification of the glycated Lys was achieved taking into account that N-(carboxyethyl)-lysine cannot be recognized by trypsin (Table 2). Thus, even if peptides 6–28 and 1–28 contain two potentially reactive lysines (i.e. at positions 16 and 28), only Lys-16 could be glycated, as the peptide bond following Lys-28 was regularly hydrolyzed by trypsin. These results demonstrated that in full-length Aβ42, only Arg-5 and Lys-16 can be modified out of the four potentially reactive groups (N terminus, Arg-5, Lys-16, and Lys-28) and confirmed that no other fluorescence products were formed during the reaction.Table 1List of the species identified for Aβ42 by MALDI/MS analysesIon (m/z)PeptideExperimental molecular weightTheoretical molecular weight4423.51–41aLaser-induced fragment.4512.41–424511.44511.34584.51–42 (N-(carboxyethyl)-lysine)4583.54583.34592.51–42 (argpyrimidine)4591.54591.44664.61–42 (argpyrimidine + N-(carboxyethyl)lysine)4663.64663.4a Laser-induced fragment.

The presence of the doubly modified peptide (observed both in the MALDI and in LC-MS analysis) indicated that glycation of one of the two sites does not significantly affect the reactivity of the other. The additional peak observed in the nonglycated Aβ42 (m/z 4423.4) was tentatively assigned to the fragment 1–41, produced during the MS analysis by the laser-induced elimination of the C-terminal alanine residue. We then adopted the widely used thioflavin T (ThT) assay to follow how glycation modifies/alters the kinetics of fiber formation (38Masino L. Nicastro G. De Simone A. Calder L. Molloy J. Pastore A. The Josephin domain determines the morphological and mechanical properties of ataxin-3 fibrils.Biophys.

It is not considered strictly quantitative (40Sabate R. Rodriguez-Santiago L. Sodupe M. Saupe S.J. Ventura S. Thioflavin-T excimer formation upon interaction with amyloid fibers.Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2013; 49 (23687656): 5745-574710.1039/c3cc42040jCrossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but nevertheless gives a reliable qualitative indication of the formation of amyloid species. We followed the fluorescence enhancement over time at 20 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in the presence and in the absence of MGO by fluorescence spectroscopy. In the absence of MGO, the ThT signal reached a maximum after 1 day (Fig. 4). Subsequently, the signal decayed, suggesting the formation of mature amyloid fibers, which precipitate a decrease of the signal. Overall, the fluorescence gain of Aβ42NG is larger than that of Aβ40NG. The glycated peptides have a different behavior. The ThT signals reached less intense maxima as compared with the nonglycated peptides. Decrease in time is observed for Aβ42G but is much less pronounced than for the nonglycated peptide. Noticeably, the intensity of the ThT fluorescence signal for the two peptides is very different. These results corroborated the hypothesis that glycation affects the Aβ42 aggregation pathway not by abolishing the process completely but by slowing down formation of mature aggregates. It is known that different batches of Aβ can behave differently due to different degrees of seeding. To verify whether our results depend on the history of the sample, we carried out in parallel the same experiments using commercial peptides. Pretreatment with TFA was carried out using the same protocol applied to the in-house synthesized peptides. We then assessed the kinetics of glycation and fiber formation using a plate reader, which allows concomitant recording of the"

We have previously described the catalytic properties of CAIX in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, a line of cells that were derived from a patient with triple negative breast cancer. We chose this line because CAIX expression in breast cancer is a marker of hypoxia and a prognosticator for reduced survival. However, CAXII expression is associated with better survival statistics than those patients with low CAXII expression. Yet CAIX and CAXII have similar catalytic activities. Here we compare the potential roles of CAIX and CAXII in the context of TNBC and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. In tumor graft models, we show that CAIX and CAXII exhibit distinct expression patterns and non-overlapping. We find the same pattern across a panel of TNBC and luminal breast cancer cell lines. This affords an opportunity to compare directly CAIX and CAXII function. Our data suggest that CAIX expression is associated with growth potentiation in the tumor graft model and in a TNBC line using knockdown strategies and blocking activity with an impermeant sulfonamide inhibitor, N-3500. CAXII was not associated with growth potentiation. The catalytic activities of both CAIX and CAXII were sensitive to inhibition by N-3500 and activated at low pH. However, pH titration of activity in membrane ghosts revealed significant differences in the catalytic efficiency and pKa values. These features provide evidence that CAIX is a more efficient enzyme than CAXII at low pH and that CAIX shifts the equilibrium between CO2 and bicarbonate in favor of CO2 production by consuming protons. This suggests that in the acidic microenvironment of tumors, CAIX plays a role in stabilizing pH at a value that favors cancer cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2810456907,"Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling is implicated in tumorigenesis and the progression of human colorectal cancers, and mutations in the components of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway are observed in the majority of patients. Therefore, extensive studies on the Wnt signaling pathway and its target genes are crucial to understand the molecular events of tumorigenesis and develop an efficacious therapy. In this study, we showed that the stress response gene ATF3 is transcriptionally activated by the binding of β-catenin and TCF4 to the redundant TCF4 site at the proximal promoter region of the ATF3 gene, indicating that ATF3 is a direct target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The loss of function or overexpression studies showed that ATF3 inhibited the migration or invasion of HCT116 cells. The expression of some MMP and TIMP genes and the ratio of MMP2/9 to TIMP3/4 mRNAs was differentially regulated by ATF3. Therefore, though ATF3 is activated downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, it acts as a negative regulator of the migration and invasion of HCT116 human colon cancer cells exhibiting aberrant Wnt/β-catenin activity. ATF3 is a candidate biomarker and target for human colorectal cancer treatment and prevention."
https://openalex.org/W2811099953,"The circadian clock is a critical regulator of immune function. We recently highlighted a role for the circadian clock in a mouse model of pulmonary inflammation. The epithelial clock protein Bmal1 was required to regulate neutrophil recruitment in response to inflammatory challenge. Bmal1 regulated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) recruitment to the neutrophil chemokine, CXC chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), providing a candidate mechanism. We now show that clock control of pulmonary neutrophilia persists without rhythmic glucocorticoid availability. Epithelial GR-null mice had elevated expression of proinflammatory chemokines in the lung under homeostatic conditions. However, deletion of GR in the bronchial epithelium blocked rhythmic CXCL5 production, identifying GR as required to confer circadian control to CXCL5. Surprisingly, rhythmic pulmonary neutrophilia persisted, despite nonrhythmic CXCL5 responses, indicating additional circadian control mechanisms. Deletion of GR in myeloid cells alone did not prevent circadian variation in pulmonary neutrophilia and showed reduced neutrophilic inflammation in response to dexamethasone treatment. These new data show GR is required to confer circadian control to some inflammatory chemokines, but that this alone is insufficient to prevent circadian control of neutrophilic inflammation in response to inhaled LPS, with additional control mechanisms arising in the myeloid cell lineage.-Ince, L.

https://openalex.org/W2811384188,"Background Genetic risk factors, intestinal microbiota and a dysregulated immune system contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We have previously demonstrated that dysfunction of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) and PTPN22 contributes to alterations of intestinal microbiota and the onset of chronic intestinal inflammation in vivo. Here, we investigated the influence of PTPN2 and PTPN22 gene variants on intestinal microbiota composition in IBD patients. Methods Bacterial DNA from mucosa-associated samples of 75 CD and 57 UC patients were sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing approach. Microbial analysis, including alpha diversity, beta diversity and taxonomical analysis by comparing to PTPN2 (rs1893217) and PTPN22 (rs2476601) genotypes was performed in QIIME, the phyloseq R package and MaAsLin pipeline. Results In PTPN2 variant UC patients, we detected an increase in relative abundance of unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Lachnospiraceae families and reduction of Roseburia when compared to PTPN2 wild-type (WT) patients. Ruminoccocus was increased in PTPN22 variant UC patients. In CD patients with severe disease course, Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, unclassified Erysipelotrichaeceae, unassigned genera from Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae families were reduced and Bacteroides were increased in PTPN2 WT carriers, while Faecalibacterium, Bilophila, Coprococcus, and Erysipelotrichaeceae were reduced in PTPN22 WT patients when compared to patients with mild disease. In UC patients with severe disease, relative abundance of Lachnobacterium was reduced in PTPN2 and PTPN22 WT patients, Dorea was increased in samples from PTPN22 WT carriers and an unassigned genus from Ruminococcaceae gen. was increased in patients with PTPN2 variant genotype. Conclusions We identified that IBD-associated genetic risk variants, disease severity and the interaction of these factors are related to significant alterations in intestinal microbiota composition of IBD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2810742889,"Objective Since 1987 all fecal samples referred to the clinical microbiology laboratory of the UZ Brussel were screened for the presence of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). In this study all STEC strains isolated over a period of 27 years (1987–2014) were reexamined to achieve deeper insight in the STEC infections in our patient population. Methods A total of 606 STEC strains from 604 patients were subjected to molecular methods for shiga toxin (stx) subtyping, detection of additional virulence genes, typing of the O-serogroups, and phylogenetic relatedness assessment of STEC O157:H7/H-. Results Since the introduction of PCR in 1991 the annual positivity rates varied between 1.1% and 2.7%. The isolation rate of STEC O157:H7/H- remained stable over the years while the isolation rate of non-O157 serotypes increased, mainly since 2011. The majority of the patients were children. Uncomplicated- and bloody diarrhea were the most prevalent gastrointestinal manifestations (respectively 51.9% and 13.6%), 4.3% of the strains were related to the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and 30.2% of the patients showed none of these symptoms. The strains were very diverse; they belonged to 72 different O-serovars and all stx subtypes except stx1d and stx2g were identified. Out of the 23 stx2f-positives one was associated with HUS and one belonged to the E. albertii species. As seen in other studies, the frequency of strains of the O157:H7/H- serotype and strains carrying stx2a, eaeA and ehxA was higher in patients with HUS. Conclusions The characteristics and trends of STEC infection seen in our patient population are similar to those noted in other countries. STEC infections in our hospital are mainly sporadic, and a substantial portion of the patients were asymptomatic carriers. Human STEC Stx2f infection was less rare than previously assumed and we report the first Belgian STEC stx2f HUS case and stx2f positive E. albertii infection."
https://openalex.org/W2810648195,"Using GWAS to identify candidate genes associated with cattle morphology traits at a functional level is challenging. The main difficulty of identifying candidate genes and gene interactions associated with such complex traits is the long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) phenomenon reported widely in dairy cattle. Systems biology approaches, such as combining the Association Weight Matrix (AWM) with a Partial Correlation in an Information Theory (PCIT) algorithm, can assist in overcoming this LD. Used in a multi-breed and multi-phenotype context, the AWM-PCIT could aid in identifying udder traits candidate genes and gene networks with regulatory and functional significance. This study aims to use the AWM-PCIT algorithm as a post-GWAS analysis tool with the goal of identifying candidate genes underlying udder morphology. We used data from 78,440 dairy cows from three breeds and with own phenotypes for five udder morphology traits, five production traits, somatic cell score and clinical mastitis. Cows were genotyped with medium (50k) or low-density (7 to 10k) chips and imputed to 50k. We performed a within breed and trait GWAS. The GWAS showed 9,830 significant SNP across the genome (p < 0.05). Five thousand and ten SNP did not map a gene, and 4,820 SNP were within 10-kb of a gene. After accounting for 1SNP:1gene, 3,651 SNP were within 10-kb of a gene (set1), and 2,673 significant SNP were further than 10-kb of a gene (set2). The two SNP sets formed 6,324 SNP matrix, which was fitted in an AWM-PCIT considering udder depth/ development as the key trait resulting in 1,013 genes associated with udder morphology, mastitis and production phenotypes. The AWM-PCIT detected ten potential candidate genes for udder related traits: ESR1, FGF2, FGFR2, GLI2, IQGAP3, PGR, PRLR, RREB1, BTRC, and TGFBR2."
https://openalex.org/W2811218988,"Early postnatal-life malnutrition remains prevalent globally, and about 45% of all child deaths are linked to malnutrition. It is not clear whether survivors of childhood malnutrition suffer from long-term metabolic effects, especially when they are later in life exposed to a fat and carbohydrate rich obesogenic diet. The lack of knowledge around this dietary ""double burden"" warrants studies to understand the long-term consequences of children previously exposed to malnutrition. We hypothesized that an early-life nutritional insult of low protein consumption in mice would lead to long-term metabolic disturbances that would exacerbate the development of diet-induced insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated the effects of feeding a low protein diet (4% wt/wt) immediately after weaning for four weeks and subsequent feeding of a high carbohydrate high fat feeding for 16 weeks on metabolic function and development of NAFLD. Mice exposed to early-life protein restriction demonstrated a transient glucose intolerance upon recovery by regular chow diet feeding. However, protein restriction after weaning in mice did not exacerbate an obesogenic diet-induced insulin resistance or progression to NAFLD. These data suggest that transient protein restriction in early-life does not exacerbate an obesogenic diet-induced NAFLD and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2811406237,"Aspergillus flavus is a saprophytic fungus that infects corn, peanuts, tree nuts and other agriculturally important crops. Once the crop is infected the fungus has the potential to secrete one or more mycotoxins, the most carcinogenic of which is aflatoxin. Aflatoxin contaminated crops are deemed unfit for human or animal consumption, which results in both food and economic losses. Within A. flavus, two morphotypes exist: the S strains (small sclerotia) and L strains (large sclerotia). Significant morphological and physiological differences exist between the two morphotypes. For example, the S-morphotypes produces sclerotia that are smaller (< 400 μm), greater in quantity, and contain higher concentrations of aflatoxin than the L-morphotypes (>400 μm). The morphotypes also differ in pigmentation, pH homeostasis in culture and the number of spores produced. Here we report the first full genome sequence of an A. flavus S morphotype, strain AF70. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the A. flavus S-morphotype genome sequence with a previously sequenced genome of an L-morphotype strain (NRRL 3357), including an in-depth analysis of secondary metabolic clusters and the identification SNPs within their aflatoxin gene clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2976436242,"Set7/9 (also known as Set7, Set9, Setd7, and Kmt7) is a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes the methylation of multiple substrates, including histone H3 and non-histone proteins. Although not essential for normal development and physiology, Set7/9-mediated methylation events play important roles in regulating cellular pathways involved in various human diseases, making Set7/9 a promising therapeutic target. Multiple Set7/9 inhibitors have been developed, which exhibit varying degrees of potency and selectivity in vitro. However, validation of these compounds in vivo has been hampered by the lack of a reliable cellular biomarker for Set7/9 activity. Here, we report the identification of Rpl29, a ribosomal protein abundantly expressed in all cell types, as a major substrate of Set7/9. We show that Rpl29 lysine 5 (Rpl29K5) is methylated exclusively by Set7/9 and can be demethylated by Lsd1 (also known as Kdm1a). Rpl29 is not a core component of the ribosome translational machinery and plays a regulatory role in translation efficiency. Our results indicate that Rpl29 methylation has no effect on global protein synthesis but affects Rpl29 subcellular localization. Using an Rpl29 methylation-specific antibody, we demonstrate that Rpl29K5 methylation is present ubiquitously and validate that (R)-PFI-2, a Set7/9 inhibitor, efficiently reduces Rpl29K5 methylation in cell lines. Thus, Rpl29 methylation can serve as a specific cellular biomarker for measuring Set7/9 activity.

PTMs can alter the properties of proteins, including their folding, stability, targeting to specific subcellular locations, interactions with ligands or other proteins, and functional states. Lysine methylation, which involves the transfer of one, two, or three methyl groups to the ϵ-nitrogen of a lysine side chain, is a widespread PTM that contributes to essentially all aspects of cell physiology (1.Wozniak G.G. Strahl B.D. Hitting the “mark”: interpreting lysine methylation in the context of active transcription.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1839 (24631869): 1353-136110.1016/j.bbagrm.2014.03.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Given their abundance, histone proteins were among the first characterized methyl-lysine proteins (2.Murray K. The occurrence of ϵ-N-methyl lysine in histones.Biochemistry. 1964; 3 (14114491): 10-1510.1021/bi00889a003Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Studies over the last two decades have established that histone lysine methylation plays critical roles in gene regulation and chromatin dynamics, with the sites (lysine residues) and degrees of methylation (mono-, di-, and trimethylation) often correlating with distinct chromatin states and functional outcomes. For example, mono- and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) mark enhancer and active promoter regions, respectively, and H3K36me3 is usually associated with transcribed regions, whereas H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 are typically enriched in repressed and heterochromatin regions, respectively (3.Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. The molecular hallmarks of epigenetic control.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2016; 17 (27346641): 487-50010.1038/nrg.2016.59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). The relative slow development of proteomic tools and the fact that most proteins are much less abundant than histones have hindered the identification of lysine methylation in other proteins. Nonetheless, numerous non-histone proteins have been shown to be methylated at lysine residues (4.Zhang X. Huang Y. Shi X. Emerging roles of lysine methylation on non-histone proteins.Cell Mol.

Lysine methylation is generated by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and removed by lysine demethylases (KDMs). The majority of known KMTs contain a catalytic SET domain, named after the three founding members of the family: Su(var)3–9, Enhancer of zeste, and Trithorax (6.Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G.

Another protein family known to methylate lysine is the seven β-strand methyltransferase family (7.Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: a chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem.

There are also two families of KDMs. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (Lsd1, also known as Kdm1a) and Lsd2 (Kdm1b) belong to the family of FAD-dependent monoamine oxidases. They remove mono- and dimethylation from H3K4 (8.Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A.

The second family of KDMs is the Jumonji C (Jmjc) domain-containing proteins, which can remove mono-, di-, and trimethylation by an oxidative mechanism requiring Fe(II) and α-ketoglutarate as co-factors (12.Klose R.J.

Although these compounds exhibit certain degrees of potency in biochemical assays in vitro, it has been difficult to validate their inhibitory effects toward Set7/9 in vivo. Despite the identification of multiple Set7/9 substrates, a reliable biomarker that can be conveniently used to measure Set7/9 activity in cells is still unavailable. The challenges include potential functional redundancy of KMTs on Set7/9 substrates, low levels of expression and methylation of Set7/9 substrates, and lack of detection reagents. In this study, we identified ribosomal protein L29 (Rpl29) as a major substrate of Set7/9. Rpl29, a component of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit abundantly expressed in all cell types, plays a regulatory role in translation efficiency but is not essential for protein synthesis (40.Kirn-Safran C.B. Oristian D.S. Focht R.J. Parker S.G. Vivian J.L. Carson D.D. Global growth deficiencies in mice lacking the ribosomal protein HIP/RPL29.Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236 (17195189): 447-46010.1002/dvdy.21046Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We showed that Rpl29 lysine 5 (Rpl29K5) is methylated exclusively by Set7/9. This methylation event had no effect on global protein synthesis but facilitated Rpl29 nuclear enrichment. We demonstrated that Rpl29K5 methylation is present ubiquitously in cell lines and validated that the Set7/9 inhibitor (R)-PFI-2 (36.Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Li F. Oudhoff M.J. Tatlock J.H. Dong A. Zeng H.

Thus, Rpl29 methylation is a specific cellular biomarker for Set7/9 activity, which would be valuable for developing and testing therapeutics that target Set7/9. In an attempt to generate a “pan” methyl-lysine antibody, New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with a peptide library that contained a single dimethyl lysine (Kme2) surrounded by six degenerate amino acids on each side (XXXXXX-Kme2-XXXXXX), and the polyclonal antibody, D3977, was purified by immunoaffinity. As Set7/9 is a promiscuous enzyme that methylates multiple substrates (4.Zhang X. Huang Y. Shi X. Emerging roles of lysine methylation on non-histone proteins.Cell Mol.

The antibody recognized multiple proteins, with the vast majority of them showing no obvious differences in both cell lines. However, a prominent signal of ∼22 kDa detected in WT cells was absent in Set7/9−/− cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the protein could be a Set7/9-specific substrate or, alternatively, its expression could be silenced in Set7/9−/− cells. To determine the identity of the protein, we performed immunoaffinity enrichment with the D3977 antibody, followed by LC and tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis. The ∼22-kDa protein turned out to be Rpl29, a component of the large (60S) ribosomal subunit. Of note, peptides containing dimethyl Lys-5 of Rpl29 were identified in WT, but not Set7/9−/−, samples, suggesting that Set7/9 catalyzes dimethylation of Rpl29 at Lys-5 (Rpl29K5me2) (Fig. 1B). Indeed, Lys-5 is present in an optimal sequence motif recognized by Set7/9, i.e. K-S-K (25.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Hauk G. Trievel R.C.

To confirm that Set7/9 is responsible for Rpl29 methylation, we stably transfected Set7/9−/− mESCs with a plasmid expressing FLAG-tagged Set7/9 or a catalytically inactive variant that harbors a histidine-to-alanine mutation at amino acid 297 (H297A) in the SET domain (15.Chuikov S.

WT Set7/9 restored Rpl29 methylation, with methylation abundance correlating with Set7/9 levels in different stable clones, whereas the H297A mutant protein failed to rescue Rpl29 methylation (Fig. 1C). To verify the methylation site, we transiently transfected FLAG-tagged Rpl29 or an Rpl29 mutant with Lys-5 being substituted with arginine (K5R). The FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the D3977 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D, Lys-5 substitution led to complete elimination of Rpl29 methylation, indicating that Lys-5 is the only site methylated by Set7/9. Set7/9 is typically a monomethyltransferase, although it has also been shown to deposit dimethyl marks on specific substrates (26.Dhayalan A. Kudithipudi S. Rathert P. Jeltsch A. Specificity analysis-based identification of new methylation targets of the SET7/9 protein lysine methyltransferase.Chem.

To confirm that Set7/9 indeed catalyzes Rpl29K5 dimethylation, we performed an in vitro methylation assay using recombinant GST-Set7/9 protein and biotinylated Rpl29 peptides (amino acids 2–15) with Lys-5 being unmodified or methylated. As shown in Fig. 1E, Set7/9 efficiently methylated the unmodified and monomethyl peptides, but not di- and trimethyl peptides. By measuring the density of the methyl signals, as well as the biotinylated peptide signals (for normalization), using the NIH ImageJ software, we estimated that the methyl signal deposited on the monomethyl peptide was ∼70% of that deposited on the unmodified peptide (Fig. 1E). The data suggest that Set7/9 catalyzes both mono- and dimethylation of Rpl29 at Lys-5, with strong activity for producing the dimethyl mark. Having established that Set7/9 specifically methylates Rpl29 at Lys-5, a rabbit mAb against an Rpl29 peptide with dimethyl Lys-5 was developed. Dot-blot analysis showed that the antibody, named dimethyl-RPL29 (Lys-5) (D8T9P) rabbit mAb, exhibited strong reactivity with the dimethyl peptide, slight cross-reactivity with the monomethyl peptide, and no reactivity with the trimethyl and unmodified peptides (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis detected a single ∼22-kDa protein in WT mESCs, but not in Set7/9−/− and Rpl29−/− mESCs (Rpl29−/− cells were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 technology, Fig. S1), thus demonstrating that the antibody is specific for methylated Rpl29 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our results show that Rpl29 is a major substrate of Set7/9. Several Set7/9 substrates, including p53, Dnmt1, E2F1, and Stat3, have been shown to be demethylated by the lysine demethylase Lsd1 (4.Zhang X. Huang Y. Shi X.

https://openalex.org/W2951673872,"The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) plays a major role in dopamine homeostasis and regulation of neurotransmission by clearing dopamine from the extracellular space using secondary active transport. Dopamine is an essential monoamine chemical messenger that regulates reward seeking behavior, motor control, hormonal release, and emotional response in humans. Psychostimulants such as cocaine primarily target the central binding site of hDAT and lock the transporter in an outward-facing conformation, thereby inhibiting dopamine reuptake. The inhibition of dopamine reuptake leads to accumulation of dopamine in the synapse causing heightened signaling. In addition, hDAT is implicated in various neurological disorders and disease-associated neurodegeneration. Despite its significance, the structural studies of hDAT have proven difficult. Instability of hDAT in detergent micelles has been a limiting factor in its successful biochemical, biophysical, and structural characterization. To overcome this hurdle, we identified ligands that stabilize hDAT in detergent micelles. We then screened ~200 single residue mutants of hDAT using a high-throughput scintillation proximity assay and identified a thermostable variant (I248Y). Here we report a robust strategy to overexpress and successfully purify a thermostable variant of hDAT in an inhibitor and allosteric ligand bound conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2810696621,"Genes are transcribed in irregular pulses of activity termed transcriptional bursts. Cellular differentiation requires coordinated gene expression; however, it is unknown whether the burst fraction (i.e. the number of active phases of transcription) or size/intensity (the number of RNA molecules produced within a burst) changes during cell differentiation. In the ocular lens, the positions of lens fiber cells correlate precisely with their differentiation status, and the most advanced cells degrade their nuclei. Here, we examined the transcriptional parameters of the β-actin and lens differentiation-specific α-, β-, and γ-crystallin genes by RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in the lenses of embryonic day (E) E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 mouse embryos and newborns. We found that cellular differentiation dramatically alters the burst fraction in synchronized waves across the lens fiber cell compartment with less dramatic changes in burst intensity. Surprisingly, we observed nascent transcription of multiple genes in nuclei just before nuclear destruction. Nuclear condensation was accompanied by transfer of nuclear proteins, including histone and nonhistone proteins, to the cytoplasm. Although lens-specific deletion of the chromatin remodeler SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 5 (Smarca5/Snf2h) interfered with denucleation, persisting nuclei remained transcriptionally competent and exhibited changes in both burst intensity and fraction depending on the gene examined. Our results uncover the mechanisms of nascent transcriptional control during differentiation and chromatin remodeling, confirm the burst fraction as the major factor adjusting gene expression levels, and reveal transcriptional competence of fiber cell nuclei even as they approach disintegration."

We compared peripheral nerve block (PNB) with analgosedation (AS) as an analgetic approach for patients with isolated extremity injury, assuming that prehospital required medical interventions (e.g. reduction, splinting of dislocation injury) using PNB are less painful and more feasible compared to AS.Thirty patients (aged 18 or older) were randomized to receive either ultrasound-guided PNB (10 mL prilocaine 1%, 10 mL ropivacaine 0.2%) or analgosedation (midazolam combined with s-ketamine or with fentanyl). Reduction-feasibility was classified (easy, intermediate, impossible) and pain scores were assessed using numeric rating scales (NRS 0-10).Eighteen patients were included in the PNB-group and twelve in the AS-group; 15 and 9 patients, respectively, suffered dislocation injury. In the PNB-group, reduction was more feasible (easy: 80.0%, impossible: 20.0%) compared to the AS-group (easy: 22.2%, intermediate: 22.2%, impossible: 55.6%; p = 0.01). During medical interventions, 5.6% [1/18] of the PNB-patients and 58.3% [7/12] of the AS-patients experienced pain (p<0.01). Recorded pain scores were significantly lower in the PNB-group during prehospital medical intervention (median[IQR] NRS PNB: 0[0-0]) compared to the AS-group (6[0-8]; p<0.001) as well as on first day post presentation (NRS PNB: 1[0-5], AS: 5[5-7]; p = 0.050). All patients of the PNB-group would recommend their analgesic technique (AS: 50.0%, p<0.01).Prehospital ultrasound-guided PNB is rapidly performed in extremity injuries with high success. Compared to the commonly used AS in trauma patients, PNB significantly reduces pain intensity and severity."
https://openalex.org/W2811483537,"Introduction To achieve measles elimination, two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) are provided through routine immunization services or vaccination campaigns. In May 2016, Kenya conducted a measles-rubella (MR) vaccination campaign targeting 19 million children aged 9 months–14 years, with a goal of achieving ≥95% coverage. We conducted a post-campaign cluster survey to estimate national coverage and classify coverage in Kenya’s 47 counties. Methods The stratified multi-stage cluster survey included data from 20,011 children in 8,253 households sampled using the recently revised World Health Organization coverage survey methodology (2015). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of national campaign coverage were calculated, accounting for study design. County vaccination coverage was classified as ‘pass,’ ‘fail,’ or ‘intermediate,’ using one-sided hypothesis tests against a 95% threshold. Results Estimated national MR campaign coverage was 95% (95% CI: 94%-96%). Coverage differed significantly (p < 0.05) by child’s school attendance, mother’s education, household wealth, and other factors. In classifying coverage, 20 counties passed (≥95%), two failed (<95%), and 25 were intermediate (unable to classify either way). Reported campaign awareness among caretakers was 92%. After the 2016 MR campaign, an estimated 93% (95% CI: 92%–94%) of children aged 9 months to 14 years had received ≥2 MCV doses; 6% (95% CI: 6%–7%) had 1 MCV dose; and 0.7% (95% CI: 0.6%–0.9%) remained unvaccinated. Conclusions Kenya reached the MR campaign target of 95% vaccination coverage, representing a substantial achievement towards increasing population immunity. High campaign awareness reflected the comprehensive social mobilization strategy implemented in Kenya and supports the importance of including strong communications platforms in future vaccination campaigns. In counties with sub-optimal MR campaign coverage, further efforts are needed to increase MCV coverage to achieve the national goal of measles elimination by 2020."

The risk of uterine rupture is at least two-fold when labor is induced. In Sweden, women are allowed to deliver vaginally after one previous Cesarean section, regardless if labor starts spontaneously or is induced. The aim of the study is to compare the proportion of uterine ruptures between the three methods (balloon catheter, Minprostin® and Cytotec®) for induction of labor in women with an unfavorable cervix and one previous Cesarean section. Material and methods Retrospective cohort study of all women with one previous Cesarean section and induction of labor with an unfavorable cervix at the four largest clinics in Stockholm during 2012–2015. Inclusion criteria: Women with a previous Cesarean section and induction of labor with a viable fetus, cephalic presentation, singleton, at ≥34 w, (n = 910). Results 3.0% (27/910) of the women with induction of labor had a uterine rupture, 91% of them had no previous vaginal delivery. The proportion of uterine ruptures was 2.0% (6/295) with orally administrated Cytotec®, 2.1% (7/335) with balloon catheter and 5.0% (14/ 281) when Minprostin® was used. Conclusions No difference in the proportion of uterine ruptures was shown when orally administrated Cytotec® and balloon catheter were compared (p = 0.64). Orally administrated Cytotec® and balloon catheter give a high success rate of vaginal deliveries (almost 70%) despite an unfavorable cervix."
https://openalex.org/W2953274720,"The mechanism by which familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) mutations within the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) affect ε-endoproteolysis is only poorly understood. Thereby, mutations in the cleavage domain reduce ε-efficiency of γ-secretase cleavage and some even shift entry into production lines. Since cleavage occurs within the TMD, a relationship between processing and TMD structure and dynamics seems obvious. Using molecular dynamic simulations, we dissect the dynamic features of wild-type and seven FAD-mutants into local and global components. Mutations consistently enhance hydrogen-bond fluctuations upstream of the ε-cleavage sites but maintain strong helicity there. Dynamic perturbation-response scanning reveals that FAD-mutants target backbone motions utilized in the bound state. Those motions, obscured by large-scale motions in the pre-bound state, provide (i) a dynamic mechanism underlying the proposed coupling between binding and ε-cleavage, (ii) key sites consistent with experimentally determined docking sites, and (iii) the distinction between mutants and wild-type."

FEWs may sell sex to male patrons and are considered a high-risk group for HIV. This study aimed to identify factors associated with recent HIV testing among FEWs in Cambodia to inform future prevention activities.Data were collected in 2014 as part of the evaluation of a larger HIV prevention project. A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to select participants from Phnom Penh and Siem Reap for face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. A logistic regression model was constructed to identify independent factors associated with recent HIV testing.Data were collected from 667 FEWs with a mean age of 25.6 (SD = 5.5). Of total, 81.7% reported ever having had an HIV test, and 52.8% had at least one test in the past six months. After adjustment for other covariates, factors independently associated with recent HIV testing included living in Phnom Penh (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.43-3.28), having received HIV education in the past six months (AOR = 3.48, 95% CI = 2.35-5.15), disagreeing with a statement that 'I would rather not know if I have HIV' (AOR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.41-3.30), agreeing with a statement that 'getting tested for HIV helps people feel better' (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.13-0.81) and not using a condom in the last sexual intercourse with a non-commercial partner (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.26-0.88).FEWs with greater knowledge and positive attitudes towards HIV testing got tested for HIV more frequently than those with lesser knowledge and less positive attitudes. These findings suggest that future interventions should focus on disseminating tailored health messages around testing practices as well as specific topics such as condom use with non-commercial partners."

However, in well-functioning, active older adults the relationship between habitual physical activity and muscle function is surprisingly unclear. Leg press velocity, force, and power, were compared between 50 older and 30 younger healthy individuals, and associations with habitual physical activity explored. An incremental power test was performed on a pneumatic leg press, with theoretical maximum velocity, force, and power calculated. Vastus lateralis muscle thickness was measured by ultrasound, and participants wore a combined accelerometer and heart rate monitor for 6-days of free-living. Older individuals produced lower absolute maximum velocity, force, and power, than younger individuals. When accounting for smaller muscle size, older individual’s maximum force and power remained markedly lower. Both groups were active, however using age specific thresholds for classifying physical activity, the older individuals engaged in twice the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in comparison to the younger individuals. There were no associations between any characteristics of muscle function and physical activity. These data support that the ability to generate force and power deteriorates with age, however habitual physical activity levels do not explain inter-individual differences in muscle function in active older individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2810355417,"Most protein folding studies until now focus on single domain or truncated proteins. Although great insights in the folding of such systems has been accumulated, very little is known regarding the proteins containing multiple domains. It has been shown that the high stability of domains, in conjunction with inter-domain interactions, manifests as a frustrated energy landscape, causing complexity in the global folding pathway. However, multidomain proteins despite containing independently foldable, loosely cooperative sections can fold into native states with amazing speed and accuracy. To understand the complexity in mechanism, studies were conducted previously on the multidomain protein malate synthase G (MSG), an enzyme of the glyoxylate pathway with four distinct and adjacent domains. It was shown that the protein refolds to a functionally active intermediate state at a fast rate, which slowly produces the native state. Although experiments decoded the nature of the intermediate, a full description of the folding pathway was not elucidated. In this study, we use a battery of biophysical techniques to examine the protein's folding pathway. By using multiprobe kinetics studies and comparison with the equilibrium behavior of protein against urea, we demonstrate that the unfolded polypeptide undergoes conformational compaction to a misfolded intermediate within milliseconds of refolding. The misfolded product appears to be stabilized under moderate denaturant concentrations. Further folding of the protein produces a stable intermediate, which undergoes partial unfolding-assisted large segmental rearrangements to achieve the native state. This study reveals an evolved folding pathway of the multidomain protein MSG, which involves surpassing the multiple misfolding traps during refolding."
https://openalex.org/W2810366302,"Molecular imaging with a fluorescent version of Tilmanocept may permit an accurate and facile detection of sentinel nodes of endometrial cancer. Tilmanocept accumulates in sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) by binding to a cell surface receptor unique to macrophages and dendritic cells. Four female Yorkshire pigs underwent cervical stromal injection of IRDye800-Tilmanocept, a molecular imaging agent tagged with near-infrared fluorescent dye and radiolabeled with gallium-68 and technetium-99m. PET/CT scans 1.5 hours post-injection provided pre-operative SLN mapping. Robotic-assisted lymphadenectomy was performed two days after injection, using the FireFly imaging system to identify nodes demonstrating fluorescent signal. After removal of fluorescent nodes, pelvic and periaortic node dissections were performed. Nodes were assayed for technetium-99m activity, and SLNs were established using the “10%-rule”, requiring that the radioactivity of additional SLNs be greater than 10% of the “hottest” SLN. Thirty-four nodal samples were assayed ex vivo for radioactivity. All the SLNs satisfying the “10%-rule” were detected using the FireFly system. Five fluorescent nodes were detected, corresponding with preoperative PET/CT scan. Three pigs had one SLN and one pig had two SLNs, with 100% concordance between fluorescence and radioactivity. Fluorescent-labeled Tilmanocept permits real-time intraoperative detection of SLNs during robotic-assisted lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer in a porcine model. When radiolabeled with gallium-68, Tilmanocept allows for preoperative localization of SLNs using PET/CT, and shows specificity to SLNs with persistent fluorescent signal, detectable using the FireFly system, for two days post-injection. In conclusion, these findings suggest that a phase I trial in human subjects is warranted, and that a long-term goal of an intra-operative administration of non-radioactive fluorescent-labeled Tilmanocept is possible."
https://openalex.org/W2809975186,"This study contributes with original empirical evidence on the distributional and welfare effects of one of the most important health policies implemented by the Mexican government in the last decade, the Seguro Popular de Salud (SPS). We analyze the effect of SPS on households' welfare using a decomposable index that considers insured and uninsured households' response to out-of-pocket (OOP) payments using both social welfare weights and inequality aversion. The disaggregation of the welfare index allows us to explore the heterogeneity of the SPS impact on households' welfare. We applied propensity score matching to reduce the self-selection bias of being SPS insured. Overall results suggest non-conclusive results of the impact of SPS on households' welfare. When we disaggregated the welfare index by different sub-population groups, our results suggest that households' beneficiaries of SPS with older adults or living in larger cities are better protected against OOP health care payments than their uninsured counterparts. However, no effect was found among SPS-insured households living in rural and smaller cities, which is a result that could be attributed to limited access to health resources in these regions. Scaling up health insurance coverage is a necessary but not sufficient condition to ensure the protection of SPS coverage against financial risks among the poor."

Due to the absence of surveillance and the lack of reliable information, many endemic countries are not able to assess their rabies burden and implement appropriate solutions. This study reports the incidence of animal bites considered at risk of rabies transmission, along with rates and determinants of the adherence to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) between 2008 and 2014 in Dodoma Region, Tanzania. A retrospective analysis of rabid animal bites considered at risk of rabies transmission at Dodoma Regional Referral Hospital (DRRH) during 2008-2014 was conducted. Data were collected from the registers of patients presenting to the hospital because of a potential rabies exposure. The patients were assessed by a trained health worker and each bite was considered as ""at risk of rabies"" based on the victim's description of the event. Overall, 10,771 patients coming from Dodoma Region attended DRRH because of a bite from a suspected rabid animal, giving a mean incidence of 74 bites at risk of rabies transmission per 100,000 persons per year. Overall, only 46.0% of people exposed received a complete course of PEP and 61.6% attended the clinic within 48 hours after the bite. Multivariate analysis shows that people age >15 years, residence in rural areas and occurrence during the rainy season were independently associated to delayed access to care. Male gender, age below 15 years. and bites occurring during the dry season were associated with completion of PEP. In this area with a high rate of at-risk bites, several factors-mainly related to health care access and to the affordability and delivery of rabies vaccines-still need to be addressed in order to reduce gender and social inequalities in rabies prevention and control. Further efforts are required to establish an efficient rabies surveillance system in Dodoma Region."
https://openalex.org/W2811038726,"This paper addresses a chaos kernel function for the relevance vector machine (RVM) in EEG signal classification, which is an important component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The novel kernel function has evolved from a chaotic system, which is inspired by the fact that human brain signals depict some chaotic characteristics and behaviors. By introducing the chaotic dynamics to the kernel function, the RVM will be enabled for higher classification capacity. The proposed method is validated within the framework of one versus one common spatial pattern (OVO-CSP) classifier to classify motor imagination (MI) of four movements in a public accessible dataset. To illustrate the performance of the proposed kernel function, Gaussian and Polynomial kernel functions are considered for comparison. Experimental results show that the proposed kernel function achieved higher accuracy than Gaussian and Polynomial kernel functions, which shows that the chaotic behavior consideration is helpful in the EEG signal classification."
https://openalex.org/W2811497209,"The polycomb group (PcG) proteins are key epigenetic regulators in stem cell maintenance. PcG proteins have been thought to act through one of two polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), but more recent biochemical analyses have challenged this model in the identification of noncanonical PRC1 (nc-PRC1) complexes characterized by the presence of Rybp or Yaf2 in place of the canonical Chromobox proteins. However, the biological significance of these nc-PRC1s and the potential mechanisms by which they mediate gene repression are largely unknown. Here, we explore the functional consequences of Yaf2 disruption on stem cell regulation. We show that deletion of Yaf2 results in compromised proliferation and abnormal differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Genome-wide profiling indicates Yaf2 functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, particularly impacting genes associated with ectoderm cell fate in a manner distinct from Rybp. We confirm that Yaf2 assembles into a noncanonical PRC complex, with deletion analysis identifying the region encompassing amino acid residues 102-150 as required for this assembly. Furthermore, we identified serine 166 as a Yaf2 phosphorylation site, and we demonstrate that mutation of this site to alanine (S166A) compromises Ring1B-mediated H2A monoubiquitination and in turn its ability to repress target gene expression. We therefore propose that Yaf2 and its phosphorylation status serve as dual regulators to maintain the pluripotent state in mESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2810134404,"Emerging infectious disease is a growing threat to global biodiversity. The infectious disease chytridiomycosis, caused by the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has led to the decline and extinction of hundreds of amphibian species. Severe Bd-caused epizootics have been documented in North, Central and South America-with many of the research focused on anurans. California, where Bd-related epizootics and amphibian declines have been reported, has some of the highest diversity of salamanders. After more than a decade since the first known epizootic in California, little is known about Bd disease dynamics in salamanders. Pacific newts (Genus: Taricha) are ideal study species because of their abundance, wide geographic range, occurrence in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and how little is known about Bd infection dynamics for this group. We conducted a retrospective study to determine the relationship between Pacific newts and the fungal pathogen. We tested 1895 specimens collected between 1889-2009 and found no evidence of Bd-infected Pacific newts until the late 1940's. Although we estimate that Bd emerged in this genus and rapidly spread geographically throughout California, we did not find evidence for epizootic dynamics. Bd infection prevalence and intensity, two measures commonly used to estimate dynamics, remained consistently low over time; suggesting Pacific newts may not be highly susceptible. Also, we found the timing of first Bd emergence in Pacific newts predate Bd emergence in other California salamander species. In addition, we found several environmental and anthropogenic factors correlated with Bd prevalence which may help explain Bd disease dynamics in the genus Taricha. Pacific newts may be a reservoir species that signal pathogen invasion into California salamanders, though further studies are needed."

Class Ia RNRs require two dimeric subunits for activity: an α2 subunit that houses the active site and allosteric regulatory sites and a β2 subunit that houses the diferric tyrosyl radical cofactor. Ribonucleotide reduction requires that both subunits form a compact α2β2 state allowing for radical transfer from β2 to α2.

With rapid subsequent phosphorylation of the dNDPs and conversion of dUDP or dCDP into TTP, RNR provides the monomeric building blocks required for DNA replication and DNA repair. RNRs also play an essential role in controlling the relative ratio and amounts of dNTP pools required for fidelity of these processes (1Hofer A. Crona M. Logan D.T. Sjöberg B.M.

The RNR of E. coli is a prototype of the class Ia RNRs (which includes human RNR) and requires two subunits, α and β, each relatively stable homodimers, for activity (Fig. 1). α contains three nucleotide binding sites: The catalytic site (C-site), the specificity site at the α2 interface (S-site) and the activity site (A-site). The A-site is an ATP-cone domain located in the N terminus of α (Fig. 1, green), binds dATP or ATP, and controls RNR activity: ATP activates and dATP inhibits. This inhibition is the subject of a report in this issue by Chen et al. (2Chen P. Y.-T. Funk M.A. Brignole E.J. Drennan C.L.

This process involves long-range radical transfer and is reversible. The active form of E. coli class Ia RNR is described in textbooks as a symmetrical complex of α2β2 and is based on a docking model of high resolution structures of α2 and β2. Biochemical studies have established that the Kd for complex formation between α2 and β2 is weak and nucleotide-dependent. Only when α2, loaded with a matched substrate/effector pair, binds to β2 do conformational changes occur that initiate the reduction chemistry (4Ge J. Yu G. Ator M.A. Stubbe J.

Inhibition is thought to arise from a near doubling of the separation between the tyrosyl radical cofactor in β2 and the cysteine in the C-site in α4β4 (∼60 Å) relative to that of α2β2, preventing formation of the essential active site thiyl radical required for reduction. Despite the correlation between dATP and inactivation, many questions remain, including the ordering of events that lead to dATP inhibition and the physiological relevance of such activity regulation.

Guided by prior structural studies they made mutants of α residues within the α/β interface in the A-site of α4β4 (green in Fig. 1). The mutants were designed to perturb this interaction, while minimizing the effect of dATP/ATP binding to the ATP-cone. Analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and negative stain EM methods were used to assess changes in quaternary structure in the presence of dATP (175 μm) and correlated with catalytic activity measurements relative to wt levels. They concluded from their studies that dATP binds to the α4β4 structure and results in RNR inhibition. However, given the distinct concentration dependence of the EM (nm) and AUC (μm) measurements, insight into the Kd for dATP binding for each mutant and for the Kd for α/β interaction in the mutants relative to wt (α/β) would have provided an even stronger correlation between the data sets. The Kd values will also be critical in evaluating how the in vitro model may translate in vivo, where nucleotide pools are complex and dynamic. In the cell, an inhibited α4β4 structure would need to reequilibrate with α2β2 in response to changes in the ratio of dATP/ATP pools and deoxynucleotide concentrations.

Interestingly, in these structures an α6 ring hexamer was observed with no β subunit. This trimer of dimers (Fig. 1) is formed by dATP cone-dATP cone interactions and appears to preclude access of β2, a requisite for catalysis. Thus, both the dATP inhibited human and E. coli RNRs appear to reduce the rate of formation of the α2β2 complex required for effective radical transfer, but by two distinct mechanisms. Further support for the importance of dATP control of quaternary structure as the basis of dATP inhibition in human cells is provided by recent studies with clofarabine (ClF). ClF is an adenosine analog that in its triphosphate state inhibits in vitro human RNR by binding to the cone domain of α and causes α6 formation in the presence or absence of β2 (9Brignole E.J.

An unresolved question is to what extent such age-related alterations in circadian organization are driven by the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), modifying timing signals to contributing peripheral tissue oscillators, and are mediated by underlying changes in the local cellular oscillators themselves. Using a bioluminescence reporter approach, we sought to determine whether circadian clock function in human adipocytes from subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissues changes with age. SAT and VAT biopsies were obtained from obese individuals during gastric bypass surgeries [n = 16; body mass index: 44.8 ± 11.4 kg/m2; age: 44 ± 9 yr (range: 30–58)]. Cells were isolated and transduced with a lentiviral circadian reporter construct [brain and muscle ary1 hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like:luciferase (BMAL:LUC)], and bioluminescence was recorded over a period of 3 d. Human BMAL1:LUC adipocytes displayed a robust luminescence rhythm with comparable within-individual periods in mature and preadipocytes (P > 0.05). With increasing age, the circadian period decreased in mature adipocytes (P = 0.005) (β = 4 min/yr; P < 0.05).

They include a highly fluorescent chemical structure, an aryloxazole ring, linked to a furan moiety operating as singlet oxygen trap. Their activity depends on both the structure of the aryloxazole fluorophore and the electron-donating and electron-accepting properties of the substituents attached to the C-5 of the furan ring. All probes are selectively oxidized by singlet oxygen to give a single fluorescent product in methanol and produce negligible amounts of singlet oxygen themselves by self-sensitization. The most promising dyad, (E)-2-(2-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)vinyl)naphtho[1,2-d]oxazole, FN-6, shows outstanding reactivity and sensitivity: it traps singlet oxygen with a rate constant (5,8 ± 0.1) x 1(07) M-1 s-1 and its fluorescence increases by a factor of 500 upon reaction. Analysis of the dyads reactivity in terms of linear free energy relationships using the modified Swain and Lupton parameter F and the Fukui condensed function for the electrophilic attack, suggests that cycloaddition of singlet oxygen to the furan ring is partially concerted and possibly involves an exciplex with a ""more open"" structure than could be expected for a concerted cycloaddition."
https://openalex.org/W2810484425,"Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules bind peptides and present them to receptors on CD4+ T cells as part of the immune system’s surveillance of pathogens and malignancy. In the absence of peptide, MHC-II equilibrates between peptide-receptive and peptide-averse conformations. The conversion between these forms has been postulated to be important in regulating cellular antigen presentation but has been difficult to study. In order to generate the MHC-II molecule HLA-DR1 in the peptide-receptive form, we designed and tested a series of photocleavable peptides that included the UV-sensitive 3-amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl)-propionate amino acid analog. They were intended to bind tightly to the HLA-DR1 MHC molecule, but to generate low-affinity fragments after UV exposure that would be released to yield HLA-DR1 in the peptide-receptive conformation. We were able to identify photocleavable peptides that bound tightly to HLA-DR1 and generated the peptide-receptive conformation after UV exposure. However, slow release of photocleaved peptide fragments from the binding site limited the rate of binding of an incoming labeled peptide and complicated kinetic measurements of the individual steps of the overall peptide binding reaction. Modification of the N-terminal region of the photocleavable peptide to reduce MHC-II pocket or H-bonding interactions allowed for generation of the peptide receptive form immediately after UV exposure with peptide fragments neither retained within the site nor interfering with binding of an incoming peptide. However this was achieved only at the expense of a substantial reduction in overall peptide binding affinity, and these peptides had such weak interaction with HLA-DR1 that they were easily exchanged by incoming peptide without UV exposure. These results show that photocleavable peptides can be used to generate peptide-receptive HLA-DR1 and to facilitate peptide exchange in generation of specific peptide-MHC-II complexes, but that usage of these peptides for kinetic studies can be constrained by slow fragment release."

This study was designed to identify reliable emotional cues from expressive behavior in women and men with Parkinson’s disease. Method Videotaped expressive behavior of 96 participants during an interview of discussing enjoyable events was rated using the Interpersonal Communication Rating Protocol. Indices from emotional measures were represented in three components. Correlational analyses between expressive behavior domains and emotional components were conducted for the total sample and by gender separately. Results More gross motor expressivity and smiling/laughing indicated more positive affect in the total sample. Less conversational engagement indicated more negative affect in women. However, women with more negative affect and depression appeared to smile and laugh more. Conclusion This study identified reliable cues from expressive behavior that could be used for assessment of emotional experience in people with Parkinson’s disease. For women, because smiling/laughing may convey two possible meanings, that is, more positive and more negative affect, this cue needs to be interpreted cautiously and be used for detecting the intensity, not the type, of emotional experience. Healthcare practitioners should be sensitive to valid cues to make an accurate evaluation of emotion in people with Parkinson’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W2809880092,"Wood ashes infused with water have been traditionally used as hair cosmetics, but little or no research has examined the effects of ash on human hair. This study investigated the effect of eucalyptus ash on the structure and morphology of excised human grey hair and its potential use as a pretreatment in natural hair dyeing using anthocyanins extracted from purple cops of Zea mays. Tensile characteristics and surface morphology of ash-pretreated hair was monitored by texture analysis, scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The biochemical characteristics of ash-treated hair were analyzed by synchrotron radiation-FTIR and sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near edge. Dyeing with anthocyanins was analyzed by Lab color scale and adsorption of anthocyanins. Ash-treated hair was elastically and plastically deformed with microscopic alterations to the ridges of the cuticle cells, similar to ammonia-treated hair. The ash extract significantly changed the relative proportion of alpha-helices in the cuticle and cortex layers (p < 0.05), but did not affect the interaction of S-bonds with neighboring atoms (p > 0.05). Ash-treated hair showed significantly enhanced adsorption of anthocyanins (p < 0.05) which changed the color of the grey hair. The alteration of secondary proteins in the cuticle and cortex layers of the grey hair by ash extract pre-treatment, enhanced anthocyanin adsorption. The eucalyptus ash could potentially be useful as a natural hair dyeing pre-treatment."

However, few studies have reported the effect of hepatitis virus infections on body composition. Our aim was to explore the association of hepatitis virus infections with percent body fat (PBF) in a cross-sectional analysis. A total of 69226 subjects obtained from the health examinations at Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) from 2010 to 2016 were enrolled in the study. Participants were divided into subgroups based on the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV. PBF was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). A multivariable linear regression model was applied to test the association of hepatitis virus infections with PBF and glycemic status. In male participants, hepatitis virus infections were closely associated with increased PBF, especially in those subjects with HCV/HBV coinfection. HCV/HBV coinfection was positively correlated with fasting plasma glucose and postprandial glucose while HCV and HBV mono-infection were not. The impact of hepatitis virus infection on increased PBF was observed in general population with gender difference. A further study on the treatment of hepatitis virus infection might help prevent the development of obesity-related diseases."

Alignment was studied in the teenage and adult population of Mexico that lacked conventional social security between 2008 and 2015, a period of expanding financial resources for health and public health insurance coverage. Spatial econometric methods were used to analyze data from the Ministry of Health on the supply and demand for ANC in 2,314 municipalities (94% of all municipalities in Mexico). During this period, the relative weight of ANC demand among adolescents increased 37% while the production of antenatal consultations for adolescent and adult women remained unchanged. Bivariate spatial analyses of correlation between supply and demand for ANC services yielded a minimal spatial correlation, or lack of territorial correspondence, between supply and demand among women in both age groups. Spatial econometric analysis confirmed a non-significant association between supply and demand for ANC services. Our findings suggest the existence of misalignment between supply and demand for these services. This requires a reassessment of the management and delivery of ANC services at the local level in order to increase effective coverage and improve the overall performance of the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2810272281,"Self-organized dendritic architecture is of fundamental importance and its application can be used in many natural and industrial processes. Nanopost arrays are usually used in the applications of reflecting grating and changing the material surface wettability. However, in recent research, it is found that nanopost arrays can be fabricated as passive components to induce the dendritic self-organizaed hierarchical architectures. Via this simplified Phase-Field based finite element simulation, the surface dendritic self-organized architecture morphology and expanding speed in the growing path can be controlled by nanopost structures. In addition, nanopost array arrangement on the surface affects the hierarchal architecture branching distribution. Finally, with an external applied force introduced to the system, it enables the nanopost as an active component. It is found that nanopost surroundings significantly impact the final distribution of dendritic architectures which is qualitatively in agreement with experiments and induce these dendritic architectures to form assigned character patterns after the external driving forces are introduced into the system. This novel study can fundamentally study the dynamic physics of dendritic self-organized architecutes provide an indicator for the development of smart self-organized architecture, and a great opportunity for the creation of large-scale hierarchical structures."
