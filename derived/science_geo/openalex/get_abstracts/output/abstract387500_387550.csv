https://openalex.org/W2171777347,"The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be used to inform association and functional studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8) per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next phase of human genetic research."
https://openalex.org/W2092350553,"Neutron stars are composed of the densest form of matter known to exist in our universe, and thus provide a unique laboratory for exploring the properties of cold matter at super-nuclear density. Measurements of the masses or radii of these objects can strongly constrain the neutron-star matter equation of state, and consequently the interior composition of neutron stars. Neutron stars that are visible as millisecond radio pulsars are especially useful in this respect, as timing observations of the radio pulses provide an extremely precise probe of both the pulsar's motion and the surrounding space-time metric. In particular, for a pulsar in a binary system, detection of the general relativistic Shapiro delay allows us to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which show a strong Shapiro delay signature. The implied pulsar mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M_sun is by far the highest yet measured with such certainty, and effectively rules out the presence of hyperons, bosons, or free quarks at densities comparable to the nuclear saturation density."
https://openalex.org/W2169895148,"Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue and colleagues use whole-genome exome sequencing to analyse primary pancreatic cancers and one or more metastases from the same patients, and find that tumours are composed of distinct subclones. The authors also determine the evolutionary maps by which metastatic cancer clones have evolved within the primary tumour, and estimate the timescales of tumour progression. On the basis of these data, they estimate a mean period of 11.8 years between the initiation of pancreatic tumorigenesis and the formation of the parental, non-metastatic tumour, and a further 6.8 years for the index metastasis clone to arise. These data point to a potentially large window of opportunity during which it might be possible to detect the cancer in a relatively early form. Peter Campbell and colleagues use next-generation sequencing to detect chromosomal rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer. The results reveal considerable inter-patient heterogeneity and indicate ongoing genomic instability and evolution during the development of metastases. But for most of the patients studied, more than half of the genetic rearrangements found were present in all metastases and the primary tumour, making them potential targets for therapeutic intervention at early and late stages of the disease. Here, whole-genome sequencing has been used to analyse primary pancreatic tumours and one or more metastases from the same patients. The findings show that tumours are composed of several geographically distinct subclones, and allow maps to be produced showing how metastatic cancer clones evolve within the primary tumour. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer has been performed. Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated1,2, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy3. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2066254965,"Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97-98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection."
https://openalex.org/W2135911378,"An eight-year study of the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning across the food web suggests that plant diversity has strong bottom-up effects on biotic interactions. The experiment by Scherber et al. manipulated plant species in specially seeded grassland plots and monitored species richness of herbivores, carnivores and all other relevant groups, and their interactions. The effects are consistent across groups, but are stronger at adjacent trophic levels and in above-ground groups rather than below-ground groups. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism. The effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function are usually studied within trophic levels. These authors conduct a large experiment across trophic levels to show how manipulations of plant diversity affect function in different groups. The effects are consistent across groups, but are stronger at adjacent trophic levels and in above-ground rather than below-ground groups. Biodiversity is rapidly declining1, and this may negatively affect ecosystem processes2, including economically important ecosystem services3. Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive effects on organisms and processes4 across trophic levels5. However, only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web perspective6. In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an unprecedented range of above- and below-ground organisms and multitrophic interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen infestation and hyperparasitism. Our results suggest that plant diversity has strong bottom-up effects on multitrophic interaction networks, with particularly strong effects on lower trophic levels. Effects on higher trophic levels are indirectly mediated through bottom-up trophic cascades."

https://openalex.org/W2063090026,"The brain has to continually select between a plethora of external sensory stimuli in order to focus on and process a few of them. Neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are selectively responsive to particular visual objects, and their activity is known to be modulated by cognitive effects. Cerf et al. have constructed a new brain–machine interface in which patients implanted with intracranial electrodes looking at superimposed computer images, when asked to make an image fade in or fade out, rapidly learnt to regulate neuronal activity of their MTL neurons in different subregions and hemispheres. They were able to increase the firing rate of certain cells while decreasing that of others and controlling the composite image content. This work provides direct evidence that humans can control the neuronal activity of their own visual neurons deep inside their own brain, and that such activity can be decoded to control devices. It is hoped that similar interface devices will one day boost the communication of patients with various neurological impairments, such as locked-in syndrome or motor neuron disease. Neurons in the medial temporal lobe are selectively responsive to particular visual objects, but their activity is modulated by internal cognitive effects. Here it is shown that humans can regulate the activity of their MTL neurons to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation. Using a brain–machine interface, subjects looked at a hybrid superposition of two images and had to enhance one image at the expense of the other, using cognitive strategies such as attention and imagery. Daily life continually confronts us with an exuberance of external, sensory stimuli competing with a rich stream of internal deliberations, plans and ruminations. The brain must select one or more of these for further processing. How this competition is resolved across multiple sensory and cognitive regions is not known; nor is it clear how internal thoughts and attention regulate this competition1,2,3,4. Recording from single neurons in patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons5,6,7,8,9, here we demonstrate that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation. Subjects looked at a hybrid superposition of two images representing familiar individuals, landmarks, objects or animals and had to enhance one image at the expense of the other, competing one. Simultaneously, the spiking activity of their MTL neurons in different subregions and hemispheres was decoded in real time to control the content of the hybrid. Subjects reliably regulated, often on the first trial, the firing rate of their neurons, increasing the rate of some while simultaneously decreasing the rate of others. They did so by focusing onto one image, which gradually became clearer on the computer screen in front of their eyes, and thereby overriding sensory input. On the basis of the firing of these MTL neurons, the dynamics of the competition between visual images in the subject’s mind was visualized on an external display."
https://openalex.org/W2012084455,"The plant SLAC1 anion channel controls turgor pressure in the aperture-defining guard cells of plant stomata, thereby regulating the exchange of water vapour and photosynthetic gases in response to environmental signals such as drought or high levels of carbon dioxide. Here we determine the crystal structure of a bacterial homologue (Haemophilus influenzae) of SLAC1 at 1.20 Å resolution, and use structure-inspired mutagenesis to analyse the conductance properties of SLAC1 channels. SLAC1 is a symmetrical trimer composed from quasi-symmetrical subunits, each having ten transmembrane helices arranged from helical hairpin pairs to form a central five-helix transmembrane pore that is gated by an extremely conserved phenylalanine residue. Conformational features indicate a mechanism for control of gating by kinase activation, and electrostatic features of the pore coupled with electrophysiological characteristics indicate that selectivity among different anions is largely a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration. SLAC1 is a recently identified anion channel found in the leaves of plants, where it controls turgor pressure and stomatal opening in response to environmental factors including carbon dioxide, ozone and drought. The X-ray crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of SLAC1 — the tellurite resistance protein TehA from Haemophilus influenzae — has now been determined. Structure-inspired mutagenesis was used to analyse the conductance properties of the channel. Electrostatic features of the pore suggest that selectivity among different anions is largely a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration. This work, together with further studies of the function of the bacterial protein, suggests that SLAC1 and TehA represent a large family of selective anion channels controlled by environmental stimuli. SLAC1 is a plant ion channel that controls turgor pressure in the guard cells of plant stomata, thereby regulating the exchange of water vapour and photosynthetic gases in response to environmental signals. Here, the X-ray crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of SLAC1 has been solved, and structure-inspired mutagenesis has been used to analyse the conductance properties of the channel. The findings indicate that selectivity among different anions is largely a function of the energetic cost of ion dehydration."
https://openalex.org/W2011447482,"Macroautophagy, a homeostatic process that shuttles cytoplasmic constituents into endosomal and lysosomal compartments, has recently been shown to deliver antigens for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Skeletal muscle fibers show a high level of constitutive macroautophagy and express MHC class II molecules upon immune activation. We found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a monokine overexpressed in inflammatory myopathies, led to a marked up-regulation of macroautophagy in skeletal myocytes. Furthermore, TNF-α augmented surface expression of MHC class II molecules in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated myoblasts. The synergistic effect of TNF-α and IFN-γ on the induction of MHC class II surface expression was not reflected by higher intracellular human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR levels and was reversed by macroautophagy inhibition, suggesting that TNF-α facilitates antigen processing via macroautophagy for more efficient MHC class II loading. Muscle biopsies from patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, a well defined myopathy with chronic inflammation, showed that over 20% of fibers that contained autophagosomes costained for MHC class II molecules and that more than 40% of double-positive muscle fibers had contact with CD4(+) and CD8(+) immune cells. These findings establish a mechanism through which TNF-α regulates both macroautophagy and MHC class II expression and suggest that macroautophagy-mediated antigen presentation contributes to the immunological environment of the inflamed human skeletal muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2027998117,"The lowermost part of the Earth's mantle-known as D″-shows significant seismic anisotropy, the variation of seismic wave speed with direction. This is probably due to deformation-induced alignment of MgSiO(3)-post-perovskite (ppv), which is believed to be the main mineral phase present in the region. If this is the case, then previous measurements of D″ anisotropy, which are generally made in one direction only, are insufficient to distinguish candidate mechanisms of slip in ppv because the mineral is orthorhombic. Here we measure anisotropy in D″ beneath North and Central America, where material from subducting oceanic slabs impinges on the core-mantle boundary, using shallow as well as deep earthquakes to increase the azimuthal coverage in D″. We make more than 700 individual measurements of shear wave splitting in D″ in three regions from two different azimuths in each case. We show that the previously assumed case of vertical transverse isotropy (where wave speed shows no azimuthal variation) is not possible, and that more complicated mechanisms must be involved. We test the fit of different MgSiO(3)-ppv deformation mechanisms to our results and find that shear on (001) is most consistent with observations and the expected shear above the core-mantle boundary beneath subduction zones. With new models of mantle flow, or improved experimental determination of the dominant ppv slip systems, this method will allow us to map deformation at the core-mantle boundary and link processes in D″, such as plume initiation, to the rest of the mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2092926839,"Famine edema was produced experimentally in 34 normal men who lost a quarter of their body weight while subsisting for 6 months on a European type of semi-starvation diet. The ratio of extracellular water to cellular tissue was roughly doubled. Their clinical state closely resembled that seen in Europe in 1945. There were no signs of renal or cardiac failure. The plasma protein concentration fell only slightly and the A/G ratio remained within normal limits. The venous pressure was roughly 50 per cent below normal. Data from the field lend support to these indications that famine edema is not simply a result of hypoproteinemia or of renal or cardiac failure. It is concluded that there is a dynamic nonequilibrium state of the capillary wall and, accordingly, calculations from equilibrium equations are inadmissible."
https://openalex.org/W2084418363,"Iodide (I(-)) is an essential constituent of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine, which are required for the development of the central nervous system in the fetus and newborn. I(-) uptake in the thyroid is mediated by the Na(+)/I(-) symporter (NIS). NIS has gained particular medical interest due to its sensitivity to the environmental pollutant perchlorate (ClO(4)(-)) and its implication in radioiodide cancer treatment. Recently, others have shown that I(-) absorption in the intestine is mediated by NIS (Nicola, J. P., Basquin, C., Portulano, C., Reyna-Neyra, A., Paroder, M., and Carrasco, N. (2009) Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 296, C654-662). However, their data suggest the participation of other systems in the homeostasis of I(-), in particular because in vivo uptake studies revealed a ClO(4)(-)-insensitive transport component. Here, we describe Na(+)-coupled I(-) uptake by the human Na(+)/multivitamin transporter (hSMVT), a related protein isolated from the placenta, where it was suggested to supply the fetus with the water-soluble vitamins biotin and pantothenic acid, and α-lipoic acid. hSMVT-mediated Na(+)/I(-) symport is inhibited by the other three organic hSMVT substrates but not by NIS substrates; notably, hSMVT is insensitive to ClO(4)(-). Because hSMVT is found in the intestine and in many other tissues, we propose that hSMVT may play an important role in the homeostasis of I(-) in the body."
https://openalex.org/W2065713555,"Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the enzyme acid β-glucosidase (GCase), the most common of which is the substitution of serine for asparagine at residue 370 (N370S). To characterize the nature of this mutation, we expressed human N370S GCase in insect cells and compared the x-ray structure and biochemical properties of the purified protein with that of the recombinant human GCase (imiglucerase, Cerezyme®). The x-ray structure of N370S mutant acid β-glucosidase at acidic and neutral pH values indicates that the overall folding of the N370S mutant is identical to that of recombinant GCase. Subtle differences were observed in the conformation of a flexible loop at the active site and in the hydrogen bonding ability of aromatic residues on this loop with residue 370 and the catalytic residues Glu-235 and Glu-340. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed a pH-dependent change in the environment of tryptophan residues in imiglucerase that is absent in N370S GCase. The mutant protein was catalytically deficient with reduced V(max) and increased K(m) values for the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside and reduced sensitivity to competitive inhibitors. N370S GCase was more stable to thermal denaturation and had an increased lysosomal half-life compared with imiglucerase following uptake into macrophages. The competitive inhibitor N-(n-nonyl)deoxynojirimycin increased lysosomal levels of both N370S and imiglucerase 2-3-fold by reducing lysosomal degradation. Overall, these data indicate that the N370S mutation results in a normally folded but less flexible protein with reduced catalytic activity compared with imiglucerase."

The quantitative removal of fibrinogen was effected by adjusting the plasma with citric acid to pH 5.4 prior to freezing to â 30° C. with excess ether. Solutions of extracted plasma protein obtained in this manner, after the removal of the dissolved ether and readjustment to p.H 7.0, have provided a satisfactory transfusion fluid, remaining crystal clear for more than two years2."
https://openalex.org/W1976479741,"Interfering intracellular antibodies are valuable for biological studies as drug surrogates and as potential macromolecular drugs per se. Their application is still limited because of the difficulty of acquisition of functional intracellular antibodies. We describe the use of the new intracellular antibody capture procedure (IAC3) to facilitate direct isolation of functional single domain antibody fragments using four independent target molecules (LMO2, TP53, CRAF1, and Hoxa9) from a set of diverse libraries. Initially, these have variability in only one of the three antigen-binding CDR regions of VH or VL and first round single domains are affinity matured by iterative randomization of the two other CDRs and reselection. We highlight the approach using a single domain binding to LMO2 protein. Our results show that interfering with LMO2 protein function demonstrates a role specifically in erythroid differentiation, confirm a necessary and sufficient function for LMO2 as a cancer therapy target in T-cell neoplasia and allowed for the first time production of soluble recombinant LMO2 protein by co-expression with intracellular domain antibodies. Co-crystallization of LMO2 and the anti-LMO2 VH protein was successful.

Antibodies and derivative fragments are molecules that can capture a huge variety of antigens with high specificity and affinity and are indispensable tools and reagents in bioscience and in medicine (1Reichert J.M. Rosensweig C.J. Faden L.B. Dewitz M.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The utilities of intracellular application of antibody fragments is that, unlike gene knock-out and interfering RNAs or antisense, these molecules interfere with cellular functions directly by binding to target proteins and can therefore target specific properties of proteins such as particular signal transduction via blockading protein-protein interaction (2Visintin M. Meli G.A. Cannistraci I. Cattaneo A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 290: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Pérez-Martínez D. Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Bioessays. 2010; 32: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This not only provides valuable and robust tools in biological analysis such as functional genomics and proteomics but also serve as drug surrogates to establish the target validity for drug development by ascertaining the biological effects from targeting the protein. To make these options possible on a broad basis, robust screening methods with high quality libraries are needed to allow selection of target-specific intracellular antibodies.

Single domain antibody fragments (DAbs), comprising either VH or VL, encompass a minimal antigen recognition can also be used for intracellular applications, so-called intracellular domain antibodies (iDAbs) (4Tanaka T. Lobato M.N. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).

Here, we describe use of IAC3 to isolate VH or VL iDAbs binding to LMO2, TP53, CRAF1, and Hoxa9. We have characterized one VH binding to LMO2 in cells that can inhibit the Lmo2 protein-protein interactions in cells and interfere with Lmo2 function in an erythroid differentiation and in a T-cell tumorigenesis assay. Furthermore, because the anti-LMO2 VH was selected against native LMO2 protein, co-expressing the VH with LMO2 in Escherichia coli facilitated bulk production of soluble recombinant LMO2 protein and crystallization of the protein complex for the first time. These results illustrate that the iDAbs isolated from the libraries by IAC3 can be applied successfully to difficult problems in biochemical and structural analysis in addition to dissecting in vivo cell biology. pBTM116-LMO2 (codons 26–159, see supplemental Fig. S3) is described elsewhere (11Nam C.H. Lobato M.N. Appert A. Drynan L.F. Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4962-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). pBD-LMO2 was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI and PstI fragment from pBTM116-LMO2 into EcoRI/PstI sites of pBD-Gal4-Cam (Stratagene). pBTM116-Hoxa9HD and pBD-Hoxa9HD were constructed by subcloning the fragment of mouse homeobox-a9 homeodomain (Hoxa9-HD, codons 205–267), from cDNA prepared from mouse spleen RNA into the EcoRI/PstI sites of the parental vectors. pBTM116-CRAF1-RBD and pBD-CRAF1-RBD were constructed by subcloning the cDNA fragment of human CRAF1 RAS binding domain (CRAF1-RBD, codon 1 to 151) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the parental vectors. pBTM116-TP53 and pBD-TP53 were constructed by subcloning the fragment of human TP53 cDNA with R273H mutation (codon 73 to 393) into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the parental vectors. The principle method to construct single domain VH or VL libraries in the yeast prey expression vector pVP16* (which carries the leucine auxotrophy gene) is shown in supplemental Fig. S1 and described in detail elsewhere (12Tanaka T. Chung G.T. Forster A. Lobato M.N. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pEFVP16-VH#6 (13Tanaka T. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) was used as the parental template for the VH libraries, and pEFVP16-VL#204 (14Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2009; 37: e41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was used for the single VL library. Fragments containing single domains with unchanged CDR1 and CDR2 and randomized CDR3 were amplified by PCR with EFFP5 and one of 14 rdmVHCDR3Rev-n primers designed to both randomize and vary the length of CDR3 (for VH) or EFFP5 and rdmVLCDR3Rev (for VL) (primer sequences in supplemental Fig. S1E). Amplified PCR fragments were purified from 2% agarose gel and purified, and further PCRs were performed with EFFP5 and NXJH5R2 (for VH) or VLDR2 (for VL) to cloning into pVP16* cut with SfiI and NotI to generate the 14 VH libraries (each with a different length of CDR3) and one VL library. The initial diversity of each library is shown in supplemental Fig. S2 (estimated from total transformants and the ratio of in-frame fusion of VH or VL with the VP16 segment). Amplification of the library was done by plating primary transformants on 25 × 25 cm LB plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin (at maximum of 2–4 × 105 colonies/plate) and incubating at 37 °C overnight. All the colonies were harvested by scraping, and plasmid DNAs were extracted by alkaline lysis method and further purified by using caesium chloride ultracentrifugation. IAC screening of single domain VH and VL libraries was performed in accordance with the protocol of the third generation IAC screening method as described elsewhere in detail (8Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Nature Protocols. 2010; 5: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transient mammalian two-hybrid assays (15Fearon E.R. Finkel T. Gillison M.L. Kennedy S.P. Casella J.F.

Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and the various forms of LMO2 bait and Gal4-DBD-RAS have been described previously (4Tanaka T. Lobato M.N. Rabbitts T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 1109-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Nam C.H. Lobato M.N. Appert A. Drynan L.F. Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4962-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, pM bait, pEFVP16-prey, pG5-Fluc, and pRL-CML plasmids were co-transfected into CHO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and assayed with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We have established a “one-plasmid” mammalian two-hybrid assay system for competitive M2H assays using a Triplex vector (8Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Nature Protocols. 2010; 5: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which allows expression of a prey protein-VP16 fusion (from the EF1α promoter) and a bicistronic mRNA (from the SV40 early promoter) comprising the Gal4-DBD-bait fusion-internal ribosome entry site-Renilla luciferase. Transfection of this plasmid was carried out into a line of CHO cells stably carrying a Firefly luciferase gene with Gal4 DNA binding sites (CHOluc15 (8Tanaka T. Rabbitts T.H. Nature Protocols. 2010; 5: 67-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Anti-LMO2 VH#576 or VL#551 were subcloned into SfiI and NotI sites of the Triplex vector to produce an iDAb-VP16 fusion gene, and LMO2 was subcloned into the BamHI/PstI sites to produce a Gal4DBD-LMO2 fusion gene. As competitors, scFv or single domains were subcloned into pEF/Myc/nuc (Invitrogen). For competitive M2H assays, the CHOluc15 were seeded in 12-well culture plates the day before transfection and grown until >90% confluent. One μg triplex vector and 1 or 2 μg competitor plasmid was transfected using 2 μl Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, lysed, and assayed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data represent a minimum of three experiments for each point, and each of which was performed in duplicate. Values are normalized for stimulated Firefly luciferase levels compared with levels for transfected Renilla luciferase. To determine the biological effects of the IAC-selected anti-LMO2 iDAb VH#576 in vivo, hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induced erythroid differentiation assays were performed with amurine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells expressing various single domains. MEL cell clone 585 (a kind gift from professor D. R. Higgs) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin. To express single domains in MEL cells, retroviruses encoding VH or VL were constructed by subcloning the single domain PCR fragments with nuclear localization signal into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pMIG (17Refaeli Y. Van Parijs L. Alexander S.I. Abbas A.K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and were transiently transfected into Plat-E viral packaging cells (18Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene. Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000. Two days after transfection, culture medium containing retrovirus were harvested and used to infect MEL585 by spinoculation at 650 × g for 1.5 h at 25 °C. Forty-eight hours after infection, GFP-positive MEL cells were separated by sorting using a Cytomation MOFLOW flow cytometer. One million GFP-positive cells were seeded into 6-cm culture dishes and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus penicillin and streptomycin with or without 4 mm HMBA. After initiation of HMBA treatment, an aliquot of the culture was harvested for cell number counting, hemoglobin staining, and Western blotting. The viable cell numbers were calculated by adding 20 μl cell culture to 20 μl trypan blue (0.4%, w/v), and viability was assessed based on the exclusion of the dye by live cells. Cell counts were conducted in triplicate. To test hemoglobin production in MEL cells, the cells were stained with diaminofluorene (DAF). A DAF stock solution was prepared to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml DAF (Sigma) in 90% glacial acetic acid and stored at 4 °C. The staining solution was prepared by adding 50 μl of DAF stock and 30 μl of 30% H2O2 to 500 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. 50 μl cell suspension in PBS were added to 50 μl of DAF staining solution and left at room temperature for 2 min, and the blue staining cells were counted under the microscope. To detect protein expression in the cells, the harvested cells were lysed by resuspending in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After spinning, the supernatants were fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membranes, and were immunodetected with anti-LMO2 monoclonal antibody (19Natkunam Y. Zhao S. Mason D.Y. Chen J. Taidi B. Jones M. Hammer A.S. Hamilton Dutoit S. Lossos I.S. Levy R. Blood. 2007; 109: 1636-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (B-5-1-2, Sigma) as the SDS-PAGE loading control. A transgenic line has been established in which Lmo2 is expressed under the control of the T-cell promoter Lck and transplantable T-cell neoplasias arise in these mice, manifest by thymoma and splenomegaly. 5L. Drynan, A. Forster, and T. H. Rabbitts, unpublished data. T-cells from Lck-Lmo2 thymoma were injected into CD1 nude (nu/nu) mouse recipients and splenomegaly allowed to occur. Immediately after sacrifice and harvesting the splenic neoplastic T-cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 20% FCS, 200 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma), 20 units/ml recombinant murine IL-2, 10 units/ml recombinant murine IL-6, and 10 units/ml recombinant human IL-7 plus penicillin and streptomycin for 48 h, and these dividing cell populations were infected with pMIG-derived retroviruses as described above. The pMIG vector allows expression of an iDAb and co-expression of GFP, allowing determination of the proportion of infected cells by flow cytometry. Specific iDAb-expressing viruses were made expressing anti-LMO2 VH#576 with a nuclear localization signal (pMIG-VH#576-nuc) or anti-RAS VH#6 with nuclear localization signal (pMIG-VH#6-nuc) and GFP. Following flow cytometric determination of percentage of infected cells, the infected populations were used for transplantation in CD1 nu/nu mice. A bolus of one million T-cells containing the infected GFP-expressed population was injected into the tail vein of recipient CD1 nu/nu mice, and recipient mice were sacrificed at 4–6 weeks (when the mice showed lymph node enlargement in mandibular, axillary, and iliac regions) after injection by which time splenomegaly was observed. The spleens were dissected from mice and weighed. To prepare single T-cell suspensions for flow cytometry, the spleen was minced in cold PBS, passed through a cell strainer (70 μm of nylon), treated with red blood cell lysis buffer (150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm KHCO3, and 0.1 mm EDTA) for 2 min at room temperature, and single cells were finally resuspended in PBS with 1% FCS. The percentage of GFP expressed cells in spleen was assessed by flow cytometry and compared with the initial population before transplantation. For co-expression of recombinant LMO2 and the anti-LMO2 VH single domain, isolated from IAC, bicistronic expression vectors were constructed by subcloning anti-LMO2 VH#576 and various truncated forms of LMO2 cDNA in pRK-HISTEV (13Tanaka T. Williams R.L. Rabbitts T.H. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3250-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and transformed into the C41(DE3) bacterial strain (20Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). The transformed bacteria were grown in LB with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C until A600 nm 0.6 at which stage ZnSO4 was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.5 mm) at 16 °C overnight (up to 16 h). The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 μm ZnSO4, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were extracted by cell disruption (Constant Systems Ltd., UK) at 25,000 psi. LMO2 and anti-LMO2 VH single domain were co-purified using a Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating HP column (5 ml, GE healthcare) using a gradient elution from 20 to 300 mm imidazole. The protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The appropriate fractions were pooled and completely digested with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease during dialysis against the buffer without imidazole at 4 °C overnight. The protein complex was repurified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) to remove cleaved His6 tags and tobacco etch virus protease. The unbound fractions (LMO2-anti LMO2 VH#576) were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore) and were further purified by gel filtration with HiLoad Superdex-75 (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions corresponding to the LMO2-anti-LMO2 VH#576 complex were pooled and concentrated again to ∼10 mg/ml for further experiments. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on the Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co., Ltd.) equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit. CD data were collected by scanning in the wavelength range of 190–260 nm with a resolution of 1 nm and a response time of 8 s. Final spectra were the sum of 10 scans accumulated at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. Background contribution due to buffer was subtracted. The concentration of the sample was 0.22 mg/ml and dissolved in 25 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8. Crystallization conditions were screened at 294 K by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method using Greiner 96 well crystallization plates (Greiner Bio-One Ltd). The Cartesian Technologies MicroSys MIS4000 pipetting instrument (Digilab Genomic Solutions) was used to perform nanoliter-scale crystallization experiments. Reservoir solutions were taken from commercial crystallization screening kits (Hampton Research): Crystal Screen I, Crystal Screen II, Salt RX, Index, Natrix, Grid Screen PEG 6000, Grid screen ammonium sulfate, Grid screen PEG/LiCl, Grid screen NaCl, Grid screen MPD, and “Quik screen” sodium phosphate. 96 solutions from each screen were dispensed, in 95-μl volumes, into the crystallization plate reservoirs by a Robbins Hydra-96 microdispenser (Art Robbins Instruments). These plates were processed by the Cartesian robot, which first dispensed 100-nl protein droplets onto the 96 crystallization platforms and then added 100 nl from the reservoir solution to each platform. The plates were sealed manually using transparent self-adhesive foil (Greiner). Crystals formed in 2 days at 294 K using Natrix reagent N5 (0.2 m potassium chloride, 0.01 m magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 0.05 m MES monohydrate, pH 5.6, 5% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000), Natrix reagent N3 (0.1 m magnesium acetate tetrahydrate, 0.05 m MES monohydrate, pH 5.6, 20% (v/v) (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol), and Grid screen ammonium sulfate A3 100 mm MES monohydrate, pH 6.0, 0.8 m ammonium sulfate. The protein crystals were confirmed as containing both LMO2 and VH#576 by SDS-PAGE using silver staining (supplemental Fig. S4C). To maximize the possibility of isolating iDAbs against any antigen using IAC3, a series of single domain VH or VL synthetic libraries with different length of CDR3 have been designed and constructed (supplemental Fig. S1, A–D). The randomisation of codons in CDR3 was achieved by PCR mutagenesis method with oligonucleotide primers shown in supplemental Fig. S1E (12Tanaka T. Chung G.T. Forster A. Lobato M.N. Rabbitts T.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e23Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The single domain anti-RAS VH#6 and VL#204 were used as the templates for PCR reactions. For VH libraries, 14 VH single domain libraries with different length of CDR3 (from 8 to 21 residues, according to ImMunoGeneTics information system numbering (21Lefranc M.P. Pommié C. Ruiz M. Giudicelli V. Foulquier E. Truong L. Thouvenin-Contet V. Lefranc G. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 55-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), supplemental Fig. S2) were prepared. A single VL library was prepared because the VL CDR3 is invariant in length. The diversity of each library is shown on supplemental Fig. S2 together with the percentage of clones with open reading frames determined by sequence analysis of 10–20 randomly selected clones from each library. The utility of these IAC3 libraries as sources of intracellular antibodies was assessed using a panel of different intracellular protein antigens, namely LMO2, TP53, CRAF1-RBD, and Hoxa9-HD. The bait plasmids for each protein, constructed by fusion to the DNA-binding domains of LexA (in pBTM116) or Gal4 (in pBD-Gal4). Initial rounds of screening of single domain libraries with CDR3 randomization were performed with LexA-antigen fusions (Fig. 1A) and interaction of bait (LexA-antigen) and prey (iDAb) confirmed with lacZ reporter expression. Prey plasmid DNAs were rescued from each initial screen, pooled, and used as PCR templates for constructing second sublibraries with CDR2 randomized. (The size of the sublibraries for each antigen are shown in Fig. 1B.) Positives from screening these secondary libraries were again pooled, and finally the CDR1 was randomized (Fig. 1C) for a tertiary screen. The Gal4-DBD antigen fusion was used as the bait in secondary and tertiary screens, to avoid carrying through VH or VL that bind to either the LexA-DBD or the DBD-antigen fusion region from initial screening. On secondary screening, large numbers of colonies from VH sublibraries grew on tryptophan, leucine, and histidine dropout selection plates. To restrict the iDAbs to those with the highest specificity and affinity, we repeated screening of LMO2, TP53, and Hoxa9-HD sublibraries with randomized CDR1 under stringent conditions of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole concentration. Finally, we obtained 88 anti-LMO2, 32 anti-TP53, and 50 anti-Hoxa9-HD VH segments and 10 anti-LMO2 VL segments (Fig. 1C). The amino acid sequences of representative anti-LMO2, anti-TP53, and anti-Hoxa9 single domains are shown in Fig. 2. Although protein expression in E. coli offers a rapid way of producing bulk recombinant protein, often target proteins (including LMO2, where our previous attempts at recombinant LMO2 expression had only resulted in LMO2 inclusion bodies in all tested experimental conditions) prove problematic to express as soluble and correctly folded proteins in quantities sufficient for structure determination, e.g. crystallization or NMR spectroscopy. IAC methods develop single domains that are selected using native protein antigens (i.e. because the selection works in vivo) and thus to evaluate the utility of these single domains as tools for biophysical analysis, we assessed synthesis of soluble recombinant LMO2 protein via co-expression with the VH#576 single domain. A His-tagged VH#576 and various forms of LMO2, encoding short truncations of LMO2 at N- and C-terminal ends, were cloned into a bicistronic expression vector, expressed in bacteria at 16 °C and co-purified with nickel-affinity chromatography. The purified complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE showing excellent levels of expression for all the LMO2 forms with approximately stoichiometric amounts of VH (Fig. 3A). The best yields were obtained with LMO2-Δ7N11C (LMO2 truncated seven amino acids of N-terminal and 11 of C-terminal regions, see supplemental Fig. S3) and VH#576, and the amounts were >10 mg per liter of bacterial culture. The quality of the LMO2 and VH#576 proteins was assessed by estimating the proportion of secondary structure using far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 3B). Spectra showed the complex contains significant levels of secondary structure, estimating 8% α-helix, 62% β-structure, and 30% random coil. The ability to produce high quantities of soluble LMO2-VH#576 heterodimer and the apparent quality of the tertiary structure of the complex suggested that crystal formation might be possible. Accordingly, protein crystallization was carried out, and initial screening of crystallization conditions yielded plate-like crystals or needle-shaped crystals within 2 days (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B) and confirmed these were as containing both LMO2 and VH#576 molecules in equal molarities (supplemental Fig. S4C). This method finding suggests that co-purification and co-crystallization of LMO2-VH proteins will allow us to take further optimized crystals to x-ray crystallographic analysis and that the general approach of single domain “coating” of recombinant protein could be applicable to other proteins that are intransigent to recombinant production systems. The IAC3 methods rely on the use of yeast as a cou"
https://openalex.org/W2075725907,"For bacteria and bacteriophages, cell wall digestion by hydrolases is a very important event. We investigated one of the proteins involved in cell wall digestion, the yomI gene product (renamed CwlP). The gene is located in the SP-β prophage region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. Inspection of the Pfam database indicates that CwlP contains soluble lytic transglycosylase (SLT) and peptidase M23 domains, which are similar to Escherichia coli lytic transglycosylase Slt70, and the Staphylococcus aureus Gly-Gly endopeptidase LytM, respectively. The SLT domain of CwlP exhibits hydrolytic activity toward the B. subtilis cell wall; however, reverse phase (RP)-HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the CwlP-SLT domain has only muramidase activity. In addition, the peptidase M23 domain of CwlP exhibited hydrolytic activity and could cleave d-Ala-diaminopimelic acid cross-linkage, a property associated with dd-endopeptidases. Remarkably, the M23 domain of CwlP possessed a unique Zn(2+)-independent endopeptidase activity; this contrasts with all other characterized M23 peptidases (and enzymes similar to CwlP), which are Zn(2+) dependent. Both domains of CwlP could hydrolyze the peptidoglycan and cell wall of B. subtilis. However, the M23 domain digested neither the peptidoglycans nor the cell walls of S. aureus or Streptococcus thermophilus. The effect of defined point mutations in conserved amino acid residues of CwlP is also determined."
https://openalex.org/W1993984389,"The Wnt pathway transcription factor T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) plays essential roles in the control of several developmental processes, including T cell development in the thymus. Although previously regarded as being required only during early T cell development, recent studies demonstrate an important role for TCF-1 in T helper 2 (Th2) cell polarization. TCF-1 was shown to activate expression of the Th2 transcription factor GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) and thus to promote the development of IL-4-producing Th2 cells independent of STAT6 signaling. In this study, we show that TCF-1 is down-regulated in human naive CD4(+) T cells cultured under Th2-polarizing conditions. The down-regulation is largely due to the polarizing cytokine IL-4 because IL-4 alone is sufficient to substantially inhibit TCF-1 expression. The IL-4-induced suppression of TCF-1 is mediated by STAT6, as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and STAT6 knockdown experiments. Moreover, we found that IL-4/STAT6 predominantly inhibits the shorter, dominant-negative TCF-1 isoforms, which were reported to inhibit IL-4 transcription. Thus, this study provides a model for an IL-4/STAT6-dependent fine tuning mechanism of TCF-1-driven T helper cell polarization."

The physiological relevance of the majority of these peptides is unknown at present, although many of them have been implicated in regulatory processes important for cell survival and adaptability. One peptide that is of particular interest to us is a 19-amino acid proteic toxin, coined IbsC, whose production is repressed by SibC, an RNA antitoxin. Together, IbsC and SibC constitute a type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) pair. To better understand the function of IbsC and to decipher the sequence determinants for its toxic phenotype, we carried out extensive sequence analyses of the peptide. We generated a series of truncation and single amino acid deletion mutants to determine the minimal sequence required for toxicity. We further probed into functionally relevant amino acids with a comprehensive set of IbsC mutants produced using a systematic sequence randomization strategy. We found that IbsC remained toxic in the presence of multiple deletions and single amino acid substitutions, despite being well-conserved in Escherichia coli and across other Gram-negative bacteria. The toxicity of this peptide was determined to be dependent on a stretch of highly hydrophobic residues near its center. Our results defined sequence-function relationship of IbsC and offered additional insights into properties common to membrane-targeting type I toxins in E. coli and related species.

https://openalex.org/W2060430566,"IN a recent unpublished lecture to the Cambridge Natural History Society on analogies between insects and aeroplanes, Mr. J. W. S. Pringle pointed out that many insects lack inherent stability ; equilibrium during flight being maintained by appropriate displacements of the wings. Their difficulties are greatest when only a single pair of wings is present. It is in such insects (Diptera, in which the forewings alone are functional, and Strepsiptera with functional hindwings only) that the reduced appendages are transformed into halteres. According to the hypothesis of Fraenkel and Pringle1, the knobbed haltere serves as an organ of equilibrium. Vibrating in one plane it acts as an alternating gyroscope. If the insect is rotated so that the plane of vibration is changed, lateral shearing forces will be set up in the cuticle of the base of the haltere and will be perceived by the campani-form sensilla."

A re-investigation of medium D has shown that in our hands it is inadequate and acid production is poor. Apparently this has also been found by Dunn et al., for in their third communication3 they recommend the use of 0.05N sodium hydroxide solution instead of 0.1 N. In a fourth paper, Dunn et al.4 describe the assay of phenylalanine with a further modification of the medium, in which a still weaker standard solution (0.028 N) is used for titrating the acid produced, although in the assays the contents of six tubes were combined and titrated with 0.111 N sodium hydroxide."
https://openalex.org/W2047655167,"IN spite of the recent controversy1 whether the Feulgen reaction stains the 'chromosomin' or the desoxyribose nucleic acid in the chromosome, the value of the above test for the identification of chromatin and chromosomes still remains unimpaired. This is more so in the case of the yeast, where volutin granules could easily be confused with chromatin. Kater2 describes and figures metachromatic granules both in parent and bud during metaphase and anaphase. On the other hand, Caspersson and Brandt3 showed that while in the resting cells the nucleic acid is confined to the volutin granules, in growing cells these granules disappear and the nucleic acid has a homogeneous distribution in the cytoplasm. The only cytological method of differentiating desoxyribose nucleic acid from the ribose type is said to be by Feulgen's nucleal reaction (Mirsky4). Both volutin and chromatin stain by ordinary staining procedures, but only chromatin is stained by the Feulgen technique. Whatever may be the interpretation of the phenomena of nucleal reaction5, the stained structure in the preparation is identified as chromatin. It appeared to us that a demonstration of the chromosomes of yeasts by the Feulgen technique would establish beyond doubt that yeasts have chromosomes and that these chromosomes conform in their behaviour to similar structures in higher plants."

The information is of necessity scrappy in view of the almost inconceivable chaos now existing in German transport and communications. One lasting impression remains with me: the certainty that it will be many years before anything approaching normal conditions returns to German museums. The destruction of buildings must be seen to be believed, and one may be excused for thinking that there is a good case for abandoning towns such as Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and others and building new towns on alternative sites. By and large, scientific collections have emerged from the War with relatively little damage since for the most part they were evacuated in time. It has certainly been proved that such a policy was wise. Exhibition collections and teaching material, on the other hand, have usually suffered the fate of the museum or university building in which they were kept, while 'souvenir-hunting' has added to the losses."

https://openalex.org/W2025913934,"IN Nature of December 26, 1936 (p. 1099)1, a method is described by A. C. Léeman for destroying Dichapetalum, a noxious weed of the Transvaal, by plastering a mixture of copper sulphate, calcium chloride and ordinary soil upon a short length of underground stem from which the 'bark' had been removed. Within twenty-four hours, leaves 15 ft. from the main stem were practically dead or dying, the downward movement being much slower (the ratios of the rates calculated from Léeman's figures being about 30: I). The movement of the copper ions was followed by placing freshly cut sections in a solution of potassium ferrocyanide, when a more or less deep red-brown colour could be seen where the copper arrived or accumulated. It was found that the movement took place “essentially” in the phloem, and it was suggested that the method could be used for the study of the translocation of solutes as such, the advantage being that the copper enters the intact sieve-tubes laterally by diffusion."

https://openalex.org/W2082417435,"IN the last few years the radio-engineer, using his own special technique, has devised two new heating processes, one for metals and one for non-metals. Few recent technical developments have excited more widespread interest among scientific workers, not because any new principle has been established, but because it is recognized that a new tool has come to hand, which in certain respects gives us a command over the forces of Nature that we have not before enjoyed. It may be true that the poor workman always quarrels with his tools ; it is none the less true that the scientific workman is always interested in a new one ; and physicists and chemists, biologists and metallurgists, as well as engineers, have shown great zest in trying the new tool on their own special problems, particularly their industrial problems. The processes are too young to make possible a considered judgment of their scientific or industrial value: I shall therefore be content to illustrate their special features by a few examples."

https://openalex.org/W2005822504,"Murgatroyd and Sykes1 report experiments in which they pre-stressed glass for a prolonged period at a stress thought to be sufficient ultimately to break it, and they afterwards broke the glass in a rapid loading, test. They found that the pre-stressing had not significantly reduced the breaking stress in the latter test. Orowan2 had previously suggested that if the time effect on the strength of glass was due to the spread of initial cracks as a consequence of atmospheric attack, the results of pre-stressing at a load sufficient ultimately to break the glass would be to reduce the strength under a subsequent short-time breaking test. Murgatroyd and Sykes therefore concluded that their results are incompatible with any theory which relates the decay in strength of glass to increase in length of cracks."
https://openalex.org/W2067596661,"RECENTLY it was announced that, on the initiative of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, there has been formed an Inter-University Council for Higher Education in the Colonies, to advise and assist in the development of facilities for higher education in colonial areas now under British administration (see Nature, March 16, p. 347). The body thus formed is representative not only of universities in Great Britain and Northern Ireland but also of institutions now enjoying full recognition as universities in Colonial areas. To those who have participated in the movement which has led to this result it must be gratifying to note how wholehearted the response of British universities has been. The result is a Council of great weight and authority, the activities of which will certainly issue in developments of the highest value and importance."
https://openalex.org/W2091891575,"THE biochemical phosphorylation reactions may be classified into three main groups: (1) The hydroxyl groups in organic molecules form phosphoric esters reversibly with inorganic phosphates, in which case the free energy of the phosphate linkage is small and of the order 1,000–2,000 calories. (2) The process of esteriflcation is coupled with an oxidation process and is also reversible. The free energy of this type of phosphate linkage is of the order of 10,000 calories. (3) Exchange occurs between the phosphate group and hydroxyl groups in the same molecule or in different molecules, either reversibly or irreversibly. The mechanism of the coupling of the oxidation and the phosphorylation in the second group of reactions has not yet been clarified, although in many instances there is fairly complete information with regard to the chemical substances and stable intermediates taking part in the reactions."
