https://openalex.org/W2150702843,"The inherent flexibility afforded by molecular design has accelerated the development of a wide variety of organic semiconductors over the past two decades. In particular, great advances have been made in the development of materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), from early devices based on fluorescent molecules to those using phosphorescent molecules. In OLEDs, electrically injected charge carriers recombine to form singlet and triplet excitons in a 1:3 ratio; the use of phosphorescent metal-organic complexes exploits the normally non-radiative triplet excitons and so enhances the overall electroluminescence efficiency. Here we report a class of metal-free organic electroluminescent molecules in which the energy gap between the singlet and triplet excited states is minimized by design, thereby promoting highly efficient spin up-conversion from non-radiative triplet states to radiative singlet states while maintaining high radiative decay rates, of more than 10(6) decays per second. In other words, these molecules harness both singlet and triplet excitons for light emission through fluorescence decay channels, leading to an intrinsic fluorescence efficiency in excess of 90 per cent and a very high external electroluminescence efficiency, of more than 19 per cent, which is comparable to that achieved in high-efficiency phosphorescence-based OLEDs."
https://openalex.org/W2072531628,"Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in the brain's reward circuit have a crucial role in mediating stress responses, including determining susceptibility versus resilience to social-stress-induced behavioural abnormalities. VTA dopamine neurons show two in vivo patterns of firing: low frequency tonic firing and high frequency phasic firing. Phasic firing of the neurons, which is well known to encode reward signals, is upregulated by repeated social-defeat stress, a highly validated mouse model of depression. Surprisingly, this pathophysiological effect is seen in susceptible mice only, with no apparent change in firing rate in resilient individuals. However, direct evidence--in real time--linking dopamine neuron phasic firing in promoting the susceptible (depression-like) phenotype is lacking. Here we took advantage of the temporal precision and cell-type and projection-pathway specificity of optogenetics to show that enhanced phasic firing of these neurons mediates susceptibility to social-defeat stress in freely behaving mice. We show that optogenetic induction of phasic, but not tonic, firing in VTA dopamine neurons of mice undergoing a subthreshold social-defeat paradigm rapidly induced a susceptible phenotype as measured by social avoidance and decreased sucrose preference. Optogenetic phasic stimulation of these neurons also quickly induced a susceptible phenotype in previously resilient mice that had been subjected to repeated social-defeat stress. Furthermore, we show differences in projection-pathway specificity in promoting stress susceptibility: phasic activation of VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), induced susceptibility to social-defeat stress. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition of the VTA-NAc projection induced resilience, whereas inhibition of the VTA-mPFC projection promoted susceptibility. Overall, these studies reveal novel firing-pattern- and neural-circuit-specific mechanisms of depression."
https://openalex.org/W2117782909,"Major depression is characterized by diverse debilitating symptoms that include hopelessness and anhedonia. Dopamine neurons involved in reward and motivation are among many neural populations that have been hypothesized to be relevant, and certain antidepressant treatments, including medications and brain stimulation therapies, can influence the complex dopamine system. Until now it has not been possible to test this hypothesis directly, even in animal models, as existing therapeutic interventions are unable to specifically target dopamine neurons. Here we investigated directly the causal contributions of defined dopamine neurons to multidimensional depression-like phenotypes induced by chronic mild stress, by integrating behavioural, pharmacological, optogenetic and electrophysiological methods in freely moving rodents. We found that bidirectional control (inhibition or excitation) of specified midbrain dopamine neurons immediately and bidirectionally modulates (induces or relieves) multiple independent depression symptoms caused by chronic stress. By probing the circuit implementation of these effects, we observed that optogenetic recruitment of these dopamine neurons potently alters the neural encoding of depression-related behaviours in the downstream nucleus accumbens of freely moving rodents, suggesting that processes affecting depression symptoms may involve alterations in the neural encoding of action in limbic circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2034475831,"The clinical efficacy and safety of a drug is determined by its activity profile across many proteins in the proteome. However, designing drugs with a specific multi-target profile is both complex and difficult. Therefore methods to design drugs rationally a priori against profiles of several proteins would have immense value in drug discovery. Here we describe a new approach for the automated design of ligands against profiles of multiple drug targets. The method is demonstrated by the evolution of an approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitor drug into brain-penetrable ligands with either specific polypharmacology or exquisite selectivity profiles for G-protein-coupled receptors. Overall, 800 ligand–target predictions of prospectively designed ligands were tested experimentally, of which 75% were confirmed to be correct. We also demonstrate target engagement in vivo. The approach can be a useful source of drug leads when multi-target profiles are required to achieve either selectivity over other drug targets or a desired polypharmacology. An automated approach designing drug ligands to multi-target profiles (with a 75% prediction success rate) is experimentally validated by the invention of novel ligands tailored to the complex and physiologically-relevant goal of identifying drugs that can specifically target profiles of multiple proteins. This paper describes a new approach to the problem of designing drugs that interact with multiple targets, which may be desirable either to achieve exquisite selectivity over other drug targets, or to obtain a drug with a particular polypharmacological profile. The authors have developed an automated, adaptive design approach to the generation of analogues and prioritizing them against a set of objectives. They tested experimentally 800 ligand–target predictions of prospectively designed ligands; 75% were confirmed correct, and the predicted target engagement was confirmed in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2089927164,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a multi-organ disease that leads to mental retardation, macro-orchidism in males and premature ovarian insufficiency in female carriers. FXS is also a prominent monogenic disease associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). FXS is typically caused by the loss of fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) expression, which codes for the RNA-binding protein FMRP. Here we report the discovery of distinct RNA-recognition elements that correspond to the two independent RNA-binding domains of FMRP, in addition to the binding sites within the messenger RNA targets for wild-type and I304N mutant FMRP isoforms and the FMRP paralogues FXR1P and FXR2P (also known as FXR1 and FXR2). RNA-recognition-element frequency, ratio and distribution determine target mRNA association with FMRP. Among highly enriched targets, we identify many genes involved in ASD and show that FMRP affects their protein levels in human cell culture, mouse ovaries and human brain. Notably, we discovered that these targets are also dysregulated in Fmr1(-/-) mouse ovaries showing signs of premature follicular overdevelopment. These results indicate that FMRP targets share signalling pathways across different cellular contexts. As the importance of signalling pathways in both FXS and ASD is becoming increasingly apparent, our results provide a ranked list of genes as basis for the pursuit of new therapeutic targets for these neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2171341930,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission is thought to be an important cellular mechanism underlying memory formation. A widely accepted model posits that LTP requires the cytoplasmic carboxyl tail (C-tail) of the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor subunit GluA1. To find the minimum necessary requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP in mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we used a single-cell molecular replacement strategy to replace all endogenous AMPA receptors with transfected subunits. In contrast to the prevailing model, we found no requirement of the GluA1 C-tail for LTP. In fact, replacement with the GluA2 subunit showed normal LTP, as did an artificially expressed kainate receptor not normally found at these synapses. The only conditions under which LTP was impaired were those with markedly decreased AMPA receptor surface expression, indicating a requirement for a reserve pool of receptors. These results demonstrate the synapse’s remarkable flexibility to potentiate with a variety of glutamate receptor subtypes, requiring a fundamental change in our thinking with regard to the core molecular events underlying synaptic plasticity. The minimal possible requirement for AMPA receptor trafficking during long-term potentiation is explored, revealing that no region of the receptor subunit is necessary, in contrast with previous work; the only requirement for LTP seems to be a large reserve of glutamate receptors. Learning and memory formation are thought to involve long-term potentiation (LTP), a rapid and lasting increase in synaptic strength between two neurons. LTP has been well described at glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is required for the formation of new memories. This study suggests, however, that the prevailing model for LTP, focusing on a single neurotransmitter receptor protein — the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 — needs to be reconsidered. Rather, it seems that no one particular glutamate receptor is critically important for the production of LTP: if there is a large enough pool available locally for a synapse, LTP will occur."
https://openalex.org/W2072522353,"Lung epithelial cells can influence immune responses to airway allergens. Airway epithelial cells also undergo apoptosis after encountering environmental allergens; yet, relatively little is known about how these are cleared, and their effect on airway inflammation. Here we show that airway epithelial cells efficiently engulf apoptotic epithelial cells and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, dependent upon intracellular signalling by the small GTPase Rac1. Inducible deletion of Rac1 expression specifically in airway epithelial cells in a mouse model resulted in defective engulfment by epithelial cells and aberrant anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal priming and challenge of these mice with house dust mite extract or ovalbumin as allergens led to exacerbated inflammation, augmented Th2 cytokines and airway hyper-responsiveness, with decreased interleukin (IL)-10 in bronchial lavages. Rac1-deficient epithelial cells produced much higher IL-33 upon allergen or apoptotic cell encounter, with increased numbers of nuocyte-like cells. Administration of exogenous IL-10 'rescued' the airway inflammation phenotype in Rac1-deficient mice, with decreased IL-33. Collectively, these genetic and functional studies suggest a new role for Rac1-dependent engulfment by airway epithelial cells and in establishing the anti-inflammatory environment, and that defects in cell clearance in the airways could contribute to inflammatory responses towards common allergens."
https://openalex.org/W2052831663,"Pore-forming toxins are critical virulence factors for many bacterial pathogens and are central to Staphylococcus aureus-mediated killing of host cells. S. aureus encodes pore-forming bi-component leukotoxins that are toxic towards neutrophils, but also specifically target other immune cells. Despite decades since the first description of staphylococcal leukocidal activity, the host factors responsible for the selectivity of leukotoxins towards different immune cells remain unknown. Here we identify the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptor CCR5 as a cellular determinant required for cytotoxic targeting of subsets of myeloid cells and T lymphocytes by the S. aureus leukotoxin ED (LukED). We further demonstrate that LukED-dependent cell killing is blocked by CCR5 receptor antagonists, including the HIV drug maraviroc. Remarkably, CCR5-deficient mice are largely resistant to lethal S. aureus infection, highlighting the importance of CCR5 targeting in S. aureus pathogenesis. Thus, depletion of CCR5(+) leukocytes by LukED suggests a new immune evasion mechanism of S. aureus that can be therapeutically targeted."

This trial investigates the use of motivational mobile phone text messages (SMS) to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) over six months. Methodology/Principal Findings CAMPS was a single-site randomized two-arm parallel design trial in Yaoundé, Cameroon. We enrolled and randomized HIV-positive adults on ART, aged 21 years and above to receive a weekly standardized motivational text message versus usual care alone. The primary outcome was adherence measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS), number of doses missed (in the week preceding the interview) and pharmacy refill data. Outcomes were measured at 3 and 6 months. Service providers and outcome assessors were blinded to allocation. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Between November and December 2010, 200 participants were randomized, with 101 in the intervention group and 99 in the control group. At 6 months, overall retention was 81.5%. We found no significant effect on adherence by VAS>95% (risk ratio [RR] 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89, 1.29; p = 0.542; reported missed doses (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87, 1.16; p>0.999) or number of pharmacy refills (mean difference [MD] 0.1, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.43; p = 0.617. One participant in the intervention arm reported a possible disclosure of status. Conclusions/Significance Standardized motivational mobile phone text messages did not significantly improve adherence to ART in this study. Other types of messaging or longer term studies are recommended. Registration 1. Pan-African Clinical Trials Registry; PACTR201011000261458 2. Clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01247181"

https://openalex.org/W1964507459,"Highly charged iron (Fe(16+), here referred to as Fe XVII) produces some of the brightest X-ray emission lines from hot astrophysical objects, including galaxy clusters and stellar coronae, and it dominates the emission of the Sun at wavelengths near 15 ångströms. The Fe XVII spectrum is, however, poorly fitted by even the best astrophysical models. A particular problem has been that the intensity of the strongest Fe XVII line is generally weaker than predicted. This has affected the interpretation of observations by the Chandra and XMM-Newton orbiting X-ray missions, fuelling a continuing controversy over whether this discrepancy is caused by incomplete modelling of the plasma environment in these objects or by shortcomings in the treatment of the underlying atomic physics. Here we report the results of an experiment in which a target of iron ions was induced to fluoresce by subjecting it to femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser; our aim was to isolate a key aspect of the quantum mechanical description of the line emission. Surprisingly, we find a relative oscillator strength that is unexpectedly low, differing by 3.6σ from the best quantum mechanical calculations. Our measurements suggest that the poor agreement is rooted in the quality of the underlying atomic wavefunctions rather than in insufficient modelling of collisional processes."

https://openalex.org/W2099255378,"A subset of ultraluminous X-ray sources (those with luminosities of less than 10(40) erg s(-1); ref. 1) are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto black holes with masses of ∼5-20M cicled dot, probably by means of an accretion disk. The X-ray and radio emission are coupled in such Galactic sources; the radio emission originates in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermost regions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring when the rate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the Eddington limit). Only four such maximal sources are known in the Milky Way, and the absorption of soft X-rays in the interstellar medium hinders the determination of the causal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of a bright new X-ray source in the nearby galaxy M 31, whose peak luminosity exceeded 10(39) erg s(-1). The radio luminosity is extremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguing that the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to the Eddington limit onto a black hole of stellar mass. Continued radio and X-ray monitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between the accretion flow and the powerful jet emission."
https://openalex.org/W2080620346,"Abnormal protein accumulation is a pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including accumulation of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Dominant mutations in the TDP-43 gene are causative for familial ALS; however, the relationship between mutant protein biochemical phenotypes and disease course and their significance to disease pathomechanism are not known. Here, we found that longer half-lives of mutant proteins correlated with accelerated disease onset. Based on our findings, we established a cell model in which chronic stabilization of wild-type TDP-43 protein provoked cytotoxicity and recapitulated pathogenic protein cleavage and insolubility to the detergent Sarkosyl, TDP-43 properties that have been observed in sporadic ALS lesions. Furthermore, these cells showed proteasomal impairment and dysregulation of their own mRNA levels. These results suggest that chronically increased stability of mutant or wild-type TDP-43 proteins results in a gain of toxicity through abnormal proteostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2044423696,"Dye-decolorizing peroxidases (DyPs) belong to the large group of heme peroxidases. They utilize hydrogen peroxide to catalyze oxidations of various organic compounds. AauDyPI from Auricularia auricula-judae (fungi) was crystallized, and its crystal structure was determined at 2.1 Å resolution. The mostly helical structure also shows a β-sheet motif typical for DyPs and Cld (chlorite dismutase)-related structures and includes the complete polypeptide chain. At the distal side of the heme molecule, a flexible aspartate residue (Asp-168) plays a key role in catalysis. It guides incoming hydrogen peroxide toward the heme iron and mediates proton rearrangement in the process of Compound I formation. Afterward, its side chain changes its conformation, now pointing toward the protein backbone. We propose an extended functionality of Asp-168, which acts like a gatekeeper by altering the width of the heme cavity access channel. Chemical modifications of potentially redox-active amino acids show that a tyrosine is involved in substrate interaction. Using spin-trapping experiments, a transient radical on the surface-exposed Tyr-337 was identified as the oxidation site for bulky substrates. A possible long-range electron transfer pathway from the surface of the enzyme to the redox cofactor (heme) is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1977568392,"Approximately one-third of the proteome is initially destined for the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum or the bacterial plasma membrane. The proper localization of these proteins is mediated by a universally conserved protein-targeting machinery, the signal recognition particle (SRP), which recognizes ribosomes carrying signal sequences and, through interactions with the SRP receptor, delivers them to the protein-translocation machinery on the target membrane. The SRP is an ancient ribonucleoprotein particle containing an essential, elongated SRP RNA for which precise functions have remained elusive. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to show that the Escherichia coli SRP-SRP receptor GTPase complex, after initial assembly at the tetraloop end of SRP RNA, travels over 100 Å to the distal end of this RNA, where rapid GTP hydrolysis occurs. This movement is negatively regulated by the translating ribosome and, at a later stage, positively regulated by the SecYEG translocon, providing an attractive mechanism for ensuring the productive exchange of the targeting and translocation machineries at the ribosome exit site with high spatial and temporal accuracy. Our results show that large RNAs can act as molecular scaffolds that enable the easy exchange of distinct factors and precise timing of molecular events in a complex cellular process; this concept may be extended to similar phenomena in other ribonucleoprotein complexes."

https://openalex.org/W1994247424,"Mast cells are derived from hematopoietic progenitors that are known to migrate to and reside within connective and mucosal tissues, where they differentiate and respond to various stimuli by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, including histamine, growth factors, and proteases. This study demonstrated that primary human mast cells as well as the rat and human mast cell lines, RBL-2H3 and HMC-1, produce the heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, with a molecular mass of 640 kDa as well as smaller molecular mass species of 300 and 130 kDa. Utilizing domain-specific antibodies coupled with N-terminal sequencing, it was confirmed that both forms contained the C-terminal module of the protein core known as endorepellin, which were generated by mast cell-derived proteases. Domain-specific RT-PCR experiments demonstrated that transcripts corresponding to domains I and V, including endorepellin, were present; however, mRNA transcripts corresponding to regions of domain III were not present, suggesting that these cells were capable of producing spliced forms of the protein core. Fractions from mast cell cultures that were enriched for these fragments were shown to bind endothelial cells via the α(2)β(1) integrin and stimulate the migration of cells in ""scratch assays,"" both activities of which were inhibited by incubation with either anti-endorepellin or anti-perlecan antibodies. This study shows for the first time that mast cells secrete and process the extracellular proteoglycan perlecan into fragments containing the endorepellin C-terminal region that regulate angiogenesis and matrix turnover, which are both key events in wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2046191576,"The nematocyst is a complex intracellular structure unique to Cnidaria. When triggered to discharge, the nematocyst explosively releases a long spiny, tubule that delivers an often highly venomous mixture of components. The box jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri, produces exceptionally potent and rapid-acting venom and its stings to humans cause severe localized and systemic effects that are potentially life-threatening. In an effort to identify toxins that could be responsible for the serious health effects caused by C. fleckeri and related species, we used a proteomic approach to profile the protein components of C. fleckeri venom. Collectively, 61 proteins were identified, including toxins and proteins important for nematocyte development and nematocyst formation (nematogenesis). The most abundant toxins identified were isoforms of a taxonomically restricted family of potent cnidarian proteins. These toxins are associated with cytolytic, nociceptive, inflammatory, dermonecrotic and lethal properties and expansion of this important protein family goes some way to explaining the destructive and potentially fatal effects of C. fleckeri venom. Venom proteins and their post-translational modifications (PTMs) were further characterized using toxin-specific antibodies and phosphoprotein/glycoprotein-specific stains. Results indicated that glycosylation is a common PTM of the toxin family while a lack of cross-reactivity by toxin-specific antibodies infers there is significant divergence in structure and possibly function among family members. This study provides insight into the depth and diversity of protein toxins produced by harmful box jellyfish and represents the first description of a cubozoan jellyfish venom proteome."

A resulting common wisdom is that it would be better for society if physicians would restrain their prescription of antibiotics. In this view, self-interest and societal interest are at odds, making antibiotic use a classic ""tragedy of the commons"".We developed two mathematical models of transmission of antibiotic resistance, featuring de novo development of resistance and transmission of resistant organisms. We analyzed the decision to prescribe antibiotics as a mathematical game, by analyzing individual incentives and community outcomes.A conflict of interest may indeed result, though not in all cases. Increased use of antibiotics by individuals benefits society under certain circumstances, despite the amplification of drug-resistant strains or organisms. In situations where increased use of antibiotics leads to less favorable outcomes for society, antibiotics may be harmful for the individual as well. For other scenarios, where a conflict between self-interest and society exists, restricting antibody use would benefit society. Thus, a case-by-case assessment of appropriate use of antibiotics may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2061777220,"Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is well established to play crucial roles in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis. X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by impaired mineralization and growth retardation associated with elevated circulating FGF23 levels. Administration of phosphate and calcitriol is effective in improving growth retardation, but is not sufficient to fully reverse impaired growth, suggesting the existence of a disease-specific mechanism in the development of growth retardation in addition to dysregulated phosphate metabolism. However, the precise mechanisms of growth retardation in XLH remain elusive. Here, we postulated that FGF23 suppressed chondrocyte proliferation in the presence of soluble α-Klotho (sKL). In vitro and ex vivo studies revealed that FGF23 formed a protein complex with sKL through KL1 internal repeat and suppressed the linear growth of metatarsals in the presence of sKL, which was antagonized by co-incubation with neutralizing antibodies against FGF23 or by knocking-down FGFR3 expression. Additionally, FGF23 binding to FGFR3 was enhanced in the presence of sKL. Histologically, the length of the proliferating zone was diminished and was associated with decreased chondrocyte proliferation. FGF23/sKL suppressed Indian hedgehog (Ihh) expression and administration of Ihh protein partially rescued the suppressive effect of FGF23/sKL on metatarsal growth. Intraperitoneal administration of sKL in Hyp mice, a murine model for XLH, caused a decrease in the length of the proliferating zone associated with decreased chondrocyte proliferation without altering circulating phosphate levels. These findings suggest that suppression of chondrocyte proliferation by FGF23 could have a causative role in the development of growth retardation in XLH."

Currently, no drug or vaccine is available for treatment or prevention. A previous study with a vaccine candidate based on the low seroprevalent adenoviruses 26 and 35 (Ad26 and Ad35) was shown to provide protection against homologous Ebola Zaire challenge in non human primates (NHP) if applied in a prime-boost regimen. Here we have aimed to expand this principle to construct and evaluate Ad26 and Ad35 vectors for development of a vaccine to provide universal filovirus protection against all highly lethal strains that have caused major outbreaks in the past. We have therefore performed a phylogenetic analysis of filovirus glycoproteins to select the glycoproteins from two Ebola species (Ebola Zaire and Ebola Sudan/Gulu,), two Marburg strains (Marburg Angola and Marburg Ravn) and added the more distant non-lethal Ebola Ivory Coast species for broadest coverage. Ad26 and Ad35 vectors expressing these five filovirus glycoproteins were evaluated to induce a potent cellular and humoral immune response in mice. All adenoviral vectors induced a humoral immune response after single vaccination in a dose dependent manner that was cross-reactive within the Ebola and Marburg lineages. In addition, both strain-specific as well as cross-reactive T cell responses could be detected. A heterologous Ad26–Ad35 prime-boost regime enhanced mainly the humoral and to a lower extend the cellular immune response against the transgene. Combination of the five selected filovirus glycoproteins in one multivalent vaccine potentially elicits protective immunity in man against all major filovirus strains that have caused lethal outbreaks in the last 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W2038907907,"Cell-cell adhesions and the cytoskeletons play important and coordinated roles in cell biology, including cell differentiation, development, and migration. Adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics are regulated by Rho-GTPases. ARHGAP21 is a negative regulator of Rho-GTPases, particularly Cdc42. Here we assess the function of ARHGAP21 in cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and scattering. We find that ARHGAP21 is localized in the nucleus, cytoplasm, or perinuclear region but is transiently redistributed to cell-cell junctions 4 h after initiation of cell-cell adhesion. ARHGAP21 interacts with Cdc42, and decreased Cdc42 activity coincides with the appearance of ARHGAP21 at the cell-cell junctions. Cells lacking ARHGAP21 expression show weaker cell-cell adhesions, increased cell migration, and a diminished ability to undergo hepatocyte growth factor-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, ARHGAP21 interacts with α-tubulin, and it is essential for α-tubulin acetylation in EMT. Our findings indicate that ARHGAP21 is a Rho-GAP involved in cell-cell junction remodeling and that ARHGAP21 affects migration and EMT through α-tubulin interaction and acetylation."

Obesity-associated adipose tissue inflammation has been suggested to cause insulin resistance, but weight loss and lipolysis also promote adipose tissue immune responses. While leukocyte-endothelial interactions are required for obesity-induced inflammation of adipose tissue, it is not known whether lipolysis-induced inflammation requires activation of endothelial cells.

Increased expression of adipose tissue cytokines IL-1β, CCL2, and TNF-α in response to CL 316,243 administration is also dependent upon E-selectin but not P-selectin. In contrast, fasting increases adipose-resident macrophages but not neutrophils, and does not activate adipose-resident endothelium.

Increased expression of adipose tissue cytokines IL-1β, CCL2, and TNF-α in response to CL 316,243 administration is also dependent upon E-selectin but not P-selectin. In contrast, fasting increases adipose-resident macrophages but not neutrophils, and does not activate adipose-resident endothelium. Thus, two models of lipolysis-induced inflammation induce distinct immune cell populations within adipose tissue and exhibit distinct dependences on endothelial activation. Importantly, our results indicate that β3-adrenergic stimulation acts through up-regulation of E-selectin in adipose tissue endothelial cells to induce neutrophil infiltration. Background: Studies suggest that lipolysis induces adipose tissue inflammation, commonly associated with type 2 diabetes. Results: Activation of adipose-resident endothelium is required for β3-adrenergic receptor-mediated but not fasting-induced inflammation. Conclusion: Both β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation and fasting induce adipose tissue inflammation, but by different mechanisms. Significance: The study shows heterogeneity of immune cell dynamics in adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is a dynamic organ that responds to nutritional cues by synthesizing and storing excess energy in the form of triglycerides during times of abundance, or releasing energy in times of need. Lipolysis, the hydrolysis of adipocyte triglyceride to glycerol and fatty acids, occurs in response to β-adrenergic stimulation by catecholamines during fasting. Conversely, in the fed state, lipolysis is inhibited by insulin, which stimulates lipogenesis (1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Adipocyte dysfunctions linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Lipolysis is controlled in adipocytes by three main lipases, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), 2The abbreviations used are: ATGLadipose triglyceride lipaseNEFAnon-esterified fatty acidHSLhormone-sensitive lipaseMGLmonoacylglycerol lipaseICAMintercellular adhesion molecule-1H&Ehematoxylin and eosinSVFstromal vascular fraction. hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) (2Zechner R.

Adipose tissue homeostasis is maintained in a complex manner through interactions with adipocytes, endothelial cells, immune cells, and others. In obesity, insulin resistance may cause an increase in basal lipolysis associated with an immune response in adipose tissue. Such adipose tissue inflammation is thought to promote systemic glucose intolerance (1Guilherme A. Virbasius J.V. Puri V. Czech M.P. Adipocyte dysfunctions linking obesity to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that a similar adipose inflammatory response occurs during weight loss or fasting, states that are also associated with increased adipose tissue lipolysis, as a consequence of β-adrenergic stimulation (9Kosteli A. Sugaru E. Haemmerle G. Martin J.F. Lei J. Zechner R. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Weight loss and lipolysis promote a dynamic immune response in murine adipose tissue.J. Clin.

Metab. 2005; 289: E608-E616Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, these latter conditions are not associated with glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, raising an interesting paradox. It is appreciated that inflammatory responses require vascular endothelial cell activation, which increases expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules that are necessary for leukocyte extravasation from the vasculature to areas of inflammation (11Pober J.S. Sessa W.C. Evolving functions of endothelial cells in inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 12Ley K. Laudanna C. Cybulsky M.I. Nourshargh S. Getting to the site of inflammation: the leukocyte adhesion cascade updated.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 678-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3078) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells can become activated in response to lipid stimuli, and this activation model is accepted in the context of atherosclerosis development (13Ringseis R. Eder K. Fatty acids and signalling in endothelial cells.Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, Essential Fatty Acids. 2010; 82: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); however, the role that adipose-resident endothelial cells play in recruitment of leukocytes to adipose tissue upon lipolysis is not well understood. Some studies suggest that endothelial-leukocyte interactions are required for adipose tissue inflammation (14Nishimura S. Manabe I. Nagasaki M. Seo K. Yamashita H. Hosoya Y. Ohsugi M. Tobe K.

P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 regulates adhesive properties of the endothelium and leukocyte trafficking into adipose tissue.Circ. Res. 2010; 107: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, whether these interactions are mediated by adipose tissue lipolysis is not known. Here, two model systems of lipolysis induction were utilized; systemic treatment with the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL 316,243 or fasting to determine the role of adipose-resident endothelial cell function in the adipose tissue immune response that ensued. Although fasting increased macrophage accumulation within adipose tissue, we surprisingly found that chemical induction of lipolysis caused a robust neutrophil infiltration into adipose tissue. Although fasting did not activate endothelial cells, β3-adrenergic receptor activation-mediated lipolysis robustly increased expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), E-selectin, and P-selectin in adipose-resident endothelium. Furthermore, E-selectin was required to mediate the β3-adrenergic receptor activation-induced adipose tissue immune response. Thus, β3-adrenergic receptor-activated lipolysis, but not fasting-induced lipolysis, is associated with an immune response in adipose tissue that correlates with and is mediated by endothelial cell activation. Wild type C57Bl/6J animals, B6.129S4-Seletm1Dmil/J and B6.129S7-Selptm1Bay/J animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. E-selectin (E-sel) and P-selectin (P-sel) knock out (KO) animals were maintained by homo- and heterozygote breeding at the UMASS animal facility. Male animals were used between 8–12 weeks of age for all of the studies. Mice were injected with 0.5 or 1 mg/kg CL 316,243 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or PBS intraperitoneally for the indicated times. Fasting studies were performed after acclimation of the mice to paper bedding for at least 5 days. Mice were fasted for 24 h. The University of Massachusetts Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all of the animal procedures. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC)s (Clonetics) were maintained in EGM-2 media (Lonza) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with PBS, the indicated amounts of CL 316,243, or 10 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α (Calbiochem) for 6 h. Total RNA was isolated from whole epididymal adipose tissue or HUVECs following the manufacturer's protocol (TriPure, Roche). Precipitated RNA was treated with DNase (DNA-free, Invitrogen) prior to reverse transcription (iScript Reverse transcriptase, Bio-Rad). SYBR green quantitative PCR (iQ SYBR green supermix, Bio-Rad) was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX97. Mice were injected for 30 min, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 16 h, or 24 h as indicated. The data obtained from the CL 316,243-injected mice were normalized to that from the PBS-injected mice at each time point to control for injection-induced inflammation.

Epididymal adipose tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Photos were taken with an Axiovert 35 Zeiss microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with an Axiocam CCl camera at 50× or 100× magnification. EDTA plasma was collected from the retro-orbital sinus after isoflurane anesthesia. NEFA were measured with a colorimetric assay (Wako) using the manual procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions. The epididymal adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated by digestion in Hanks balanced salt solution, 2.5% BSA and 2 mg/ml collagenase for 45 min and strained through a 70 μm filter followed by red blood cell lysis. Cells were blocked with mouse IgG in FACS buffer (1% BSA/PBS). Cells were stained with antibodies directed toward F4/80 (APC, ABd serotec), CD11b (Percp 5.5, BD), Siglec F (PE, BD), GR-1 (APC-Cy7, BD), Ly6c (PE-Cy7, BD), Galectin 3 (FITC, BioLegend), and CD11c (V450, BD). The data were collected on an LSRII (BD) and were analyzed with FlowJo software. Samples were gated for scatter and single cells. Gates were drawn based on fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls. A total of 100,000 events were recorded. To study the effects of lipolysis on adipose tissue inflammation, we utilized a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist that has been previously documented to robustly induce lipolysis and hence, adipose tissue inflammation, CL 316,243 (CL) (9Kosteli A.

As expected, CL 316,243 treatment acutely increased serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) by a maximum of 4-fold at the 30-min time point (Fig. 1A). Adipose tissue samples from these same mice were obtained for histology and the slides stained with H&E. As expected, an increase in adipose tissue inflammatory cells was observed in the CL 316,243-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated mice that peaked between 16 and 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1B). To identify what cell types were infiltrating into the adipose tissue upon CL 316,243 treatment, we isolated the adipose tissue stromal vascular fraction (SVF) from animals that had been injected with PBS or 1 mg/kg CL 316,243 for 18 h and characterized these cells with flow cytometry. Macrophages were identified as cells that were positive for CD11b and F4/80 antigen, and negative for the eosinophil marker Siglec F (19Wu D. Molofsky A.B. Liang H.E. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R.

In the PBS-treated mice, ∼12% of Siglec F-negative SVF cells were positive for both CD11b and F4/80. Interestingly, no increase in these CD11b & F4/80 double positive cells after CL 316,243 treatment was observed, as was previously reported (Fig. 1C) (9Kosteli A. Sugaru E. Haemmerle G. Martin J.F.

However, there was a 65% increase in CD11b-positive cells after CL 316,243 treatment (39% in PBS-treated mice versus 64% in CL 316,243-treated mice), which was statistically significant (p < 0.005, data not shown) (Fig. 1C).

In an acute immune response, neutrophil infiltration precedes that of monocytes and macrophages (27Mantovani A. Cassatella M.A. Costantini C. Jaillon S. Neutrophils in the activation and regulation of innate and adaptive immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that these CD11b-positive cells that had infiltrated into the CL 316,243-treated adipose tissue may be of the granulocyte lineage. To assess this, the cells were stained for GR-1, a granulocyte marker that is present on neutrophils. CL 316,243 treatment increased GR-1-positive cells in adipose tissue SVF nearly 10-fold over PBS injection alone (Fig. 1C). These GR-1-positive cells highly expressed CD11b and did not express high levels of F4/80 or Ly6c (Fig. 1D), indicating that they are likely neutrophils rather than myeloid-derived suppressor cells (28Xia S. Sha H. Yang L. Ji Y. Ostrand-Rosenberg S. Qi L. Gr-1+ CD11b+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells suppress inflammation and promote insulin sensitivity in obesity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 23591-23599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, CL 316,243 administration intraperitoneally is associated with acute adipose tissue inflammation and neutrophil infiltration. To further characterize the nature of this immune response, RNA was isolated from mice that had been injected intraperitoneally with PBS or 0.5 mg/kg CL 316,243 after 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 16, or 24 h, and the expression of several inflammatory genes was measured by qRT-PCR. Gene expression was normalized to 36B4, and the gene expression in the CL 316,243-treated adipose tissue was compared with that in the PBS-treated mice for each time point. Because CL 316,243 treatment is associated with increased adipose tissue inflammation, macrophage marker genes as well as the expression of several inflammatory cytokines were measured. Consistent with the 65% increase in CD11b-positive cells by FACS (data not shown and Fig. 1C) after CL 316,243 treatment, a 3.47-fold increase in Itgam, which encodes CD11b, was noted 24 h after CL 316,243 treatment (Fig. 2A). A gradual increase in the mRNA levels of an additional leukocyte marker, CD68 was also observed, which peaked at a 2-fold increase in the CL 316,243-treated mice after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Although it has been previously documented that CL 316,243 treatment causes adipose tissue macrophage infiltration (9Kosteli A. Sugaru E. Haemmerle G. Martin J.F. Lei J. Zechner R. Ferrante Jr., A.W. Weight loss and lipolysis promote a dynamic immune response in murine adipose tissue.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3466-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 10Granneman J.G. Li P. Zhu Z. Lu Y. Metabolic and cellular plasticity in white adipose tissue I: effects of β3-adrenergic receptor activation.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 289: E608-E616Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), no change in Itgax mRNA levels, which encodes CD11c protein, could be detected during the CL 316,243 treatment time course (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, an acute 50% reduction in EMR1 expression (Fig. 2D), which encodes the macrophage F4/80 protein, was observed after CL 316,243 treatment compared with PBS-treated mice. These results are consistent with the notion that the CL 316,243-induced infiltrating cells are not macrophages. Large increases were also noted in the mRNA levels of several inflammatory cytokines within adipose tissue acutely after CL 316,243 treatment. Interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA levels were increased by 140-fold and CCL-2/MCP-1 mRNA levels were increased by 30-fold in CL 316,243-treated compared with PBS-treated adipose tissue. The expression levels of these cytokines peaked 4 h after CL 316,243 treatment, and remained increased for at least 24 h (Fig. 2, E and F). Cytokines TNFα and IL-6 were also induced in adipose tissue by CL 316,243 treatment, by 6- and 600-fold, respectively (Fig. 2, G and H). The expression of these cytokines peaked two hours after CL 316,243 treatment and also remained elevated over 24 h. Interestingly, the up-regulation of these cytokines within the adipose tissue occurred at a time point that was prior to leukocyte infiltration (Fig. 1B), which suggests that these cytokines may be secreted from adipose-resident cells rather than infiltrating cells. Thus, the up-regulation of these cytokines may be important for induction of leukocyte infiltration into adipose tissue in response to β3-adrenergic receptor activation. We hypothesized that the immune cells that were infiltrating adipose tissue after CL 316,243 treatment derived from the circulation, and if this were the case, that these immune cells were being recruited to the adipose tissue through activation of adipose-resident endothelium. Inflammatory stimuli cause transcriptional up-regulation of endothelial genes ICAM-1, vascular-cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin, and this up-regulation is necessary for leukocyte recruitment into the inflamed tissue (11Pober J.S. Sessa W.C. Evolving functions of endothelial cells in inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar, 29Pober J.S. Endothelial activation: intracellular signaling pathways.Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: S109-S116Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Indeed, CL 316,243-treated mice displayed an increase in the mRNA expression of these genes compared with PBS-treated mice. In the CL 316,243-treated mice, there was a 3-fold increase in ICAM-1 expression, a 17-fold increase in E-selectin expression, and a 4.5-fold increase in P-selectin expression that peaked 4 h after CL 316,243 treatment (Fig. 3, A–D). This peak in the expression of these leukocyte adhesion molecule genes preceded the immune cell infiltration into adipose tissue (Fig. 1), suggesting that up-regulation of these molecules may be necessary for lipolysis-induced leukocyte infiltration. However, VCAM-1 expression was not induced after CL 316,243 treatment (Fig. 3B). As VCAM-1 is important for firm adhesion of monocytes/macrophages and T cells to the vessel wall, rather than neutrophils (12Ley K. Laudanna C. Cybulsky M.I. Nourshargh S. Getting to the site of inflammation: the leukocyte adhesion cascade updated.Nat. Rev.

To test whether endothelial cells could be directly activated by CL 316,243 in the absence of other cell types, primary endothelial cells derived from human umbilical veins (HUVECs) were treated with increasing doses of CL 316,243 for 6 h, at which time RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR was performed for ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin. Importantly, no up-regulation of the adhesion molecules was noted after CL 316,243 treatment at doses that are comparable to the in vivo dose employed (0.1–1 μg/ml), and only at the highest dose of CL 316,243 treatment (100 μg/ml) was a very small up-regulation of ICAM-1 expression noted. In contrast, stimulation of HUVECs with TNFα, a known activator of endothelial cells, caused significant up-regulation of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E selectin (Fig. 3E). We also performed similar experiments in which HUVECs were treated with 1 μg/ml CL 316,243 in combination with 100 μm palmitate or oleate for 4 h, and we found that these fatty acids were not sufficient to up-regulate leukocyte adhesion molecule expression in the presence or absence of CL 316,243 (data not shown). These results suggest that CL 316,243 treatment itself causes little or no endothelial cell activation, but suggest that other adipose-resident cells activate the"

Engineered, biologically functionalized materials have the capacity to influence stem cell behavior through a powerful combination of biological, mechanical, and topographical cues. Here, we present the development of a novel electrospun scaffold, functionalized with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) ionically immobilized onto the fiber surface. Bound GAGs retained the ability to interact with GAG-binding molecules and, crucially, presented GAG sulfation motifs fundamental to mediating stem cell behavior. Bound GAG proved to be biologically active, rescuing the neural differentiation capacity of heparan sulfate-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells and functioning in concert with FGF4 to facilitate the formation of extensive neural processes across the scaffold surface. The combination of GAGs with electrospun scaffolds creates a biomaterial with potent applicability for the propagation and effective differentiation of pluripotent stem cells."

The protein has been reported variously to exist in helical loops under the cell surface, to rotate, and to move in patches in both directions around the cell surface. Studies of the Escherichia coli protein in vitro have been hampered by its tendency to aggregate. Here we report the purification and characterization of native E. coli MreB. The protein requires ATP hydrolysis for polymerization, forms bundles with a left-hand twist that can be as long as 4 μm, forms sheets in the presence of calcium, and has a critical concentration for polymerization of 1.5 μM."
https://openalex.org/W2045737062,"The challenge for structural biology is to understand atomic-level macromolecular motions during enzymatic reaction. X-ray crystallography can reveal high resolution structures; however, one perceived limitation is that it reveals only static views. Here we use time-dependent soak-trigger-freeze X-ray crystallography, namely, soaking nucleotide and divalent metal into the bacteriophage RNA polymerase (RNAP)-promoter DNA complex crystals to trigger the nucleotidyl transfer reaction and freezing crystals at different time points, to capture real-time intermediates in the pathway of transcription. In each crystal structure, different intensities and shapes of electron density maps corresponding to the nucleotide and metal were revealed at the RNAP active site which allow watching the nucleotide and metal bindings and the phosphodiester bond formation in a time perspective. Our study provides the temporal order of substrate assembly and metal co-factor binding at the active site of enzyme which completes our understanding of the two-metal-ion mechanism and fidelity mechanism in single-subunit RNAPs. The nucleotide-binding metal (Me(B)) is coordinated at the active site prior to the catalytic metal (Me(A)). Me(A) coordination is only temporal, established just before and dissociated immediately after phosphodiester bond formation. We captured these elusive intermediates exploiting the slow enzymatic reaction in crystallo. These results demonstrate that the simple time-dependent soak-trigger-freeze X-ray crystallography offers a direct means for monitoring enzymatic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1984030808,"Mia40 and the sulfhydryl:cytochrome c oxidoreductase Erv1/ALR are essential for oxidative protein import into the mitochondrial intermembrane space in yeast and mammals. Although mitochondrial protein import is functionally conserved in the course of evolution, many organisms seem to lack Mia40. Moreover, except for in organello import studies and in silico analyses, nothing is known about the function and properties of protist Erv homologues. Here we compared Erv homologues from yeast, the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania tarentolae, and the non-related malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Both parasite proteins have altered cysteine motifs, formed intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro and in vivo, and could not replace Erv1 from yeast despite successful mitochondrial protein import in vivo. To analyze its enzymatic activity, we established the expression and purification of recombinant full-length L. tarentolae Erv and compared the mechanism with related and non-related flavoproteins. Enzyme assays indeed confirmed an electron transferase activity with equine and yeast cytochrome c, suggesting a conservation of the enzymatic activity in different eukaryotic lineages. However, although Erv and non-related flavoproteins are intriguing examples of convergent molecular evolution resulting in similar enzyme properties, the mechanisms of Erv homologues from parasitic protists and opisthokonts differ significantly. In summary, the Erv-mediated reduction of cytochrome c might be highly conserved throughout evolution despite the apparent absence of Mia40 in many eukaryotes. Nevertheless, the knowledge on mitochondrial protein import in yeast and mammals cannot be generally transferred to all other eukaryotes, and the corresponding pathways, components, and mechanisms remain to be analyzed."

The Japanese government has increased the number of medical school enrollments since 2008, but some researchers warn that this increase could lead to physician surplus in the future. It is unknown how many physicians will be required to accommodate future healthcare needs.We simulated changes in age/sex composition of the population, fatalities (the number of fatalities for the consecutive five years), and number of physicians from 2010 to 2035. Two indicators were defined: fatalities per physician and fatalities by physician working hour, based on the data of the working hours of physicians for each tuple of sex and age groups. We estimated the necessary number of physicians in 2035 and the number of new physicians to maintain the indicator levels in 2010.The number of physicians per 1,000 population is predicted to rise from 2·00 in 2010 to 3·14 in 2035. The number of physicians aged 60 years or older is expected to increase from 55,375 (20% of physicians) to 141,711 (36%). In 2010 and 2035, fatalities per physician were 23·1 and 24·0 for the total population, and 13·9 and 19·2 for 75 years or older, respectively. Fatalities per physician working hour are predicted to rise from 0·128 to 0·138. If working hours are limited to 48 hours per week in 2035, the number of fatalities per physician working hour is expected to be 0·196, and the number of new physicians must be increased by 53% over the current pace.The number of physicians per population continues to rise, but the estimated supply will not fulfill the demand for healthcare in the aging society. Strategies to increase the number of physicians and improve working conditions are urgently needed."

A CHDL domain was shown to be present in RapA, a protein that is involved in autoaggregation of Rhizobium cells, biofilm formation, and adhesion to plant roots as shown by us and others. Structural similarity to cadherins suggested calcium-dependent oligomerization of CHDL domains as a mechanistic basis for RapA action. Here we show by circular dichroism spectroscopy, light scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and other methods that RapA2 from Rhizobium leguminosarum indeed exhibits a cadherin-like β-sheet conformation and that its proper folding and stability are dependent on the binding of one calcium ion per protein molecule. By further in silico analysis we also reveal that RapA2 consists of two CHDL domains and expand the range of CHDL-containing proteins in bacteria and archaea.

Rhizobia are soil bacteria that establish symbiotic interactions with leguminous plants, inducing nitrogen-fixing root nodules under conditions of nitrogen starvation. Rhizobia are able to colonize several and diverse niches such as the bulk soil, the rhizosphere, and the vicinity of plant tissues. It was proposed that the ability of rhizobia to form different types of biofilms on a variety of surfaces might contribute to their ability to colonize (1Downie J.A.

Rap proteins contain one or several so-called “Ra” (Rhizobium-adhering) domains, which consist of 100–120 amino acids with a high degree of similarity displaying at least 20 conserved residues. Rap proteins include the RapA1 and RapA2 paralogues that were proposed as agglutinins and others of unknown function such as RapB, RapC, and RL2702 (herein RapD) (5Krehenbrink M. Downie J.A.

Furthermore, the EPS-glycanases PlyA, PlyB, and PlyC, secreted by the PrsDE system, also contain a Ra domain in their C terminus and can thus also be considered as members of the Rap family (5Krehenbrink M.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1304-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The smallest members of the Rap family (∼25 kDa) are RapA1 and RapA2, composed solely by two Ra domains. RapA1 is an extracellular calcium-binding protein with affinity for the cellular surface of R. leguminosarum biovars and Rhizobium etli. Remarkably, RapA1 binds to the cell surface at one pole. Exogenously added RapA1 caused aggregation of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii cells, which was inhibited by incubation with a crude EPS preparation of the same strain (6Ausmees N. Jacobsson K.

Therefore, it was argued that the surface receptor of RapA1 may be some structure of the acidic EPS. RapA1 overproduction increased the attachment of R. leguminosarum R200 cells to clover roots (8Mongiardini E.J. Ausmees N. Pérez-Giménez J. Julia Althabegoiti M. Ignacio Quelas J. López-García S.L.

Ecol. 2008; 65: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting its involvement in colonization or biofilm formation. Interestingly, the C-terminal Ra domain of RapA1 has been identified as a cadherin-like domain (CHDL) that is also found in many other proteins from taxonomically diverse bacteria (9Cao L. Yan X.

Cadherins are a family of eukaryotic calcium-binding proteins that contain characteristic repeat sequences (cadherin domains) in their extracellular regions and are responsible for the initiation and maintenance of cell-cell contacts through a calcium-dependent mechanism (10Nollet F.

Biol. 2000; 299: 551-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The bacterial CHDL domains (∼110 amino acids) were predicted to have an immunoglobulin β-sandwich-fold with Greek-key topology, similar to the characteristic fold of eukaryotic cadherins (9Cao L.

In this scenario, RapA2 with its two tandem Ra/CHDL domains, would mediate homophilic protein-protein interactions between Ra/CHDL domains on the surface of two neighboring cells (trans interactions). Here we further expand the set of bacterial proteins harboring a CHDL domain, emphasizing the need to understand the function of this broadly conserved protein domain. To gain insight into the function of the bacterial CHDL domain, we have structurally characterized RapA2 from R. leguminosarum bv. viciae strain 3841 (14Young J.P. Crossman L.C. Johnston A.W.

We show that RapA2 is structurally similar to cadherins and propose that all homologous Ra domains are bacterial CHDL domains. However, biophysical evidence strongly suggests that RapA2 does not mediate cell-cell contacts via calcium-dependent protein-protein interactions as is the case for cadherins. Instead, we demonstrate that RapA2 directly binds to EPS/capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and that calcium modulates both RapA2 folding and its carbohydrate binding ability. Our findings suggest that other bacterial CHDL domains would confer carbohydrate binding properties to their cognate proteins. R. leguminosarum bv. viciae strains 3841 (16Johnston A.W. Beringer J.E.

Multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30372) Google Scholar) at EMBL-EBI using default settings. The resulting alignments were colored, and the consensus was calculated using the Chroma program (26Goodstadt L. Ponting C.P. CHROMA. Consensus-based colouring of multiple alignments for publication.Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 845-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction and protein fold recognition of RapA2 were performed using the 3D-Jury MetaServer in which results of various prediction servers are jointly evaluated (27Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. 3D-Jury. A simple approach to improve protein structure predictions.Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Four templates with the highest 3D-Jury scores (Protein Data Bank codes 1edh, 2a4e, 2a62, and 2o72 for mouse E-cadherin, mouse cadherin-11, mouse cadherin-8, and human E-cadherin, respectively) were chosen to predict the tertiary structure of RapA2 using the Deep View-SwissPdbViewer program version 4.0.4 and the automated mode of the Swiss Model workspace. All measurements were done with protein samples dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with the addition of CaCl2 at the indicated concentration. Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter. The protein was diluted to 7 μm (0.18 mg/ml) and placed in a cell with a 1-mm path length. Spectra were acquired over the wavelength range of 196–260 nm. Thermally induced denaturation of RapA2 at varying calcium concentrations was followed by CD spectroscopy. Measurements were performed in a Peltier-thermostatted cell holder using a 1-mm path length cell. The spectra of RapA2 with or without added calcium were recorded as a function of temperature ranging from 15 to 95 °C with a 1 °C/min thermal gradient and a spectrum recorded every 5 °C. The reversibility of protein unfolding was examined by scanning the same sample and recording the CD spectra after rapid cooling to 15 °C. Spectra in the near-UV region (260–320) were recorded at 25 °C in a 10-mm path cell using a protein concentration of 75 μm and various concentrations of CaCl2. Each spectrum was the average of at least eight scans to reduce noise. Binding of 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (ANS) to RapA2 was measured with a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorimeter using 50 μm ANS, 75 μm RapA2, and 0.5 or 1 mm CaCl2. The excitation wavelength was set at 370 nm, and spectra were recorded from 400 to 600 nm at 25 °C. A VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc.) was used for calcium binding studies, and data were analyzed using the software Origin 7.0 supplied by Microcal. Ligand and protein solutions were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Titration was carried out at 25 °C. RapA2 (400 μm) in the sample cell was titrated with 33 injections, 8 μl each of CaCl2 (10 mm). The injections were made at 180-s intervals. A control experiment was carried out to measure the ligand dilution heat that was subtracted from the calcium binding thermogram before data analysis. A Precision Detector PD2010 light-scattering instrument connected to an FPLC system and a LKB 2142 differential refractometer were used. RapA2 (300 μl, 1.5 mg/ml) was loaded on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column; size exclusion chromatography was performed at 0.4 ml/min in buffer composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with CaCl2 added at 0.1 or 4 mm. The 90° light scattering, refractive index, and absorbance of the eluting material were recorded and analyzed with the Discovery32 software supplied by Precision Detectors. The 90° light scattering detector was calibrated using BSA as a standard. For dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies, the protein was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl pH 8.0 with the addition of the indicated concentration of CaCl2 (0–4 mm). DLS was measured with a Malvern Nanos S instrument model ZEN 1600. Diameter distribution was calculated from the average of 20 measurements. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli et al. (28Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) but without the addition of SDS or reducing agent to the standard solutions. When needed, 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the gel and to the running buffer. RapA2 and RapB (20 μg each) were preincubated alone or in a mixture in PBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of 2 mm CaCl2. CPS and EPS of R. leguminosarum strains were obtained from cells and culture supernatants, respectively, from cultures grown for 2 days in Y-mannitol minimal medium. To isolate CPS, the cell pellets were washed gently with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 mm MgSO4 followed by vigorous stirring in a washing buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl for 1 h at room temperature and centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h. CPS in the supernatant was precipitated with 2 volumes of cold ethanol, recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and subsequently washed with increasing concentrations of ethanol (70–90% v/v). The samples were air-dried, resuspended in sterile water, and stored at −20 °C. EPS was precipitated from culture supernatants by the addition of two volumes of cold ethanol followed by centrifugation. Washing and subsequent treatments were as described for CPS preparations. Succinoglycan was obtained from a 4-day culture of S. meliloti in GMS medium. Cells were removed by centrifugation, and succinoglycan was precipitated from culture supernatants by the addition of 3 volumes of ethanol. Quantification of polysaccharides was done by determination of hexoses by the sulfuric acid-anthrone method (29Loewus M.W. Briggs D.R. The number of catalytically active sites present on the chymotrypsin molecule.J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 199: 857-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and determination of hexuronic acids by the meta-hydroxybiphenyl method (30Filisetti-Cozzi T.M. Carpita N.C. Measurement of uronic acids without interference from neutral sugars.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Proteinase K treatment of acidic EPS and CPS was done according to Jefferson and Cerca (31Jefferson K.K. Cerca N. Methods in Molecular Biology. Cell-Cell Interactions: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2006: 119-126Google Scholar). Briefly, samples of R. leguminosarum acidic EPS or CPS (1 mg/ml) were incubated with proteinase K (2 mg/ml) in a 2-ml volume. Proteinase was heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 30 min. Then treated polysaccharides were precipitated with ethanol, exhaustively washed, dried, and resuspended in sterile water. Purified RapA2 (40 μg) was mixed with polysaccharide suspensions containing 0.5 mg of EPS or CPS in 200 μl of PBS. Incubations were carried out at room temperature with gentle agitation for 20 min. Polysaccharides (0.25% in mixture reactions) were separated from supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h as described for xanthan gum (32Sandford P.A. Pittsley J.E. Knutson C.A. Watson P.R. Cadmus M.C. Janes A. Sandford P.A. Laskin A. Variation in Xanthomonas campestris NRRL B-1459.

The efficacy of EPS sedimentation at 100,000 × g was confirmed by quantification of hexuronic acids in both fractions. Pellets were washed once with PBS, and the presence of protein in the pellet and supernatant fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE. The binding of RapA2 to the different polysaccharides was characterized by a modified ELISA technique. Flat-bottomed Microlon 600 microplates (Greiner) were coated with 100 μl of the EPS suspension in coating buffer (50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.7) at 4 °C overnight. Binding of RapA2 (50 ng/ml in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5 mm CaCl2) was detected with a monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. 4-Nitrophenyl phosphate was used as substrate in the phosphatase reaction. For binding inhibition assays RapA2 was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with serial 10-fold dilutions of the putative inhibitory compound before the addition to the wells of"
https://openalex.org/W1965208671,"To address the ""endoplasmic reticulum stress"" triggered by the burden of protein synthesis, the unfolded protein response is induced during osteoblast differentiation. In this study, we show that the transcription of parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor (PTH1R) is regulated by one of the endoplasmic reticulum-stress mediators, the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, in osteoblasts. We found that the increase in Pth1r transcription upon BMP2 treatment is significantly suppressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking IRE1α. As expected, gene silencing of Ire1α and Xbp1 resulted in a decrease in Pth1r transcripts in BMP2-treated embryonic fibroblasts. We identified two potential binding sites for XBP1 in the promoter region of Pth1r and found that XBP1 promotes the transcription of Pth1r by directly binding to those sites. Moreover, we confirmed that the gene silencing of Xbp1 suppresses PTH-induced Rankl expression in primary osteoblasts and thereby abolishes osteoclast formation in an in vitro model of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, the present study reveals potential involvement of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway in PTH-induced osteoclastogenesis through the regulation of PTH1R expression."

Most cancers develop autonomy from growth factor signaling often through mutations or changes in protein expression (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. The hallmarks of cancer.Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22350) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been identified as key regulators of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and one of these cascades, Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2, has been the target of many pharmaceutical endeavors (2Shaw R.J.

Several MEK1/2 inhibitors including selumetinib, MEK162, GSK1120212, CI-1040, PD0325901, and XL518 have either been or are currently being evaluated in phase I/II clinical trials, and still others are in preclinical development (3Frémin C.

The survival of many myeloid leukemia cells, both in vitro and in vivo, depends on the activation of this MAPK pathway, and various MEK1/2 inhibitors have been used to successfully inhibit leukemic proliferation (18Morgan M.A. Dolp O. Reuter C.W.

In this study we tested four MEK1/2 inhibitors in HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells which harbor an N-RAS mutation and demonstrate constitutive MAPK activation (18Morgan M.A. Dolp O. Reuter C.W.

The most effective preclinical compounds targeting the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway are against MEK1/2. Because ERK1/2 are the only known substrates of MEK1/2, the proliferative inhibition and reduced survival seen following MEK1/2 inhibition are attributed to ERK1/2-mediated factors (4Roberts P.J.

PD98059 and U0126 are the most popular preclinical MEK1/2 inhibitors used to study this pathway, and the results obtained with these compounds in cell culture have been used to justify the development of clinical inhibitors. Here we show that these structurally distinct MEK1/2 inhibitors and a newer inhibitor, MEK inhibitor I (MIIC), 2The abbreviations used are: MIICMEK inhibitor ICCCPcarbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazoneCytccytochrome cCytOXcytochrome oxidaseDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideETCelectron transport chain. not only block ERK1/2 phosphorylation but also cause acute alterations of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function. MEK inhibitor I carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone cytochrome c cytochrome oxidase dimethyl sulfoxide electron transport chain. The ETC is composed of four protein complexes containing electron carriers embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane and cytochrome c (Cytc) present in the intermembrane space. Complex III, Cytc, and cytochrome oxidase (complex IV) (CytOX) contain heme electron carriers which can either be oxidized (not carrying electrons) or reduced (carrying electrons), and their oxidation state can be measured with multiwavelength cell spectroscopy. Inhibition of the mitochondrial complexes results in an upstream reduction and a downstream oxidation of the electron carriers as well as decreasing oxygen consumption allowing multiwavelength cell spectroscopy, combined with NADH spectroscopy, to pinpoint the site of mitochondrial inhibition in living cells (21Hollis V.S. Palacios-Callender M. Springett R.J. Delpy D.T. Moncada S. Monitoring cytochrome redox changes in the mitochondria of intact cells using multi-wavelength visible light spectroscopy.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1607: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that PD98059, U0126, and MIIC potently inhibit the ETC at complex I at concentrations routinely used in the literature for inhibition of MEK1/2, and we investigate the role of this inhibition on human leukemia cell proliferation. Furthermore, we show that PD198306, a newer and more potent MEK1/2 inhibitor, acts as a robust mitochondrial protonophore and uncouples oxidative phosphorylation at higher concentrations. In short, we show the strong mitochondrial effects of these compounds provide a new mechanism by which these inhibitors regulate cell proliferation. HL-60 cells were cultured at 37 °C in spinner flasks in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 95% air and 5% CO2 incubator. Cell density and viability were determined via trypan blue exclusion using the Countess® Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen). Proliferation was defined as the increase in viable (trypan blue-excluding) cells over time compared with vehicle control-treated cells. This definition takes into account changes due to cell division, differentiation, and death. U0126 (C18H16N6S2) and PD198306 (C18H16F3IN2O2) were purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). PD98059 (C16H13NO3) was from Promega. MEK inhibitor I designated MIIC (C21H18N4OS) was from EMD/Calbiochem. Rotenone and pyridaben were from Sigma. Rotenone was dissolved in ethanol. Pyridaben and the MEK1/2 inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, and controls were treated with a correlating concentration of DMSO. Inhibitors were added as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were spun down at 500 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in at a density of 2.0 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium and placed in a custom-built 5-ml chamber that consisted of a 17-mm inside-diameter quartz crucible embedded in an aluminum block maintained at 37.0 °C by a thermoelectric element. The oxygen concentration within the chamber was measured from the fluorescence lifetime of a phosphorescent membrane inserted through a 3-mm-diameter hole in the side of the crucible, and the top of the chamber was sealed with a stainless steel plunger. The stir bar was made of glass rather than Teflon, and all of the seals were made of Viton in accordance with good respirometry practice (22Haller T. Ortner M. Gnaiger E. A respirometer for investigating oxidative cell metabolism: toward optimization of respiratory studies.Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cells were oxygenated and deoxygenated under computer control by exchange of oxygen across 80 mm of oxygen-permeable silicone tubing immersed in the cell suspension using a feedback circuit to adjust the oxygen tension within the tubing to maintain constant oxygenation within the chamber; the tubing always contained 5% CO2 to maintain intracellular pH. Oxygen consumption was measured from the difference between the oxygen delivery to the cell suspension by the tubing and the rate change of the oxygen concentration of the cell suspension. The oxygen delivery was calculated from the oxygen gradient across the wall of tubing and the oxygen permeability of the tubing which was measured prior to each study. Heme attenuation spectra and NADH fluorescence spectra were measured with two separate CCD-spectrograph systems working in time-multiplexed mode at 50 Hz using a 6-ms on/4-ms off duty cycle. Contiguous spectra were averaged to give a temporal resolution of 0.5 s. A warm white light emitting diode (LED) was used for the attenuation spectra illumination which was mounted 10 mm below a bundle of three NA0.37 1-mm optical fibers. One fiber was used for attenuation spectra detection, one for fluorescence spectra detection and one was coupled to a 365-nm UV LED for fluorescence excitation. The two detection fibers were F-matched onto the slits of two 0.3-mm spectrographs (Triax 320; Horiba, Edison, NJ), each equipped with a 1024 × 128-pixel back-thinned CCD camera (DV401BV; Andor Technology, South Windsor, CT). The attenuation spectrograph was equipped with a 600 g/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, which provided complete spectra between 508 and 640 nm with a pixel bandpass of 0.16 nm. The slits were set to give a spectral resolution of 1 nm. The NADH fluorescence spectrograph was equipped with a 300 g/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, which provided complete spectra between 400 and 670 nm with a pixel bandpass of 0.33 nm. The slits were set to give a spectral resolution of 20 nm. Heme oxidation changes were calculated by fitting a linear combination of model spectra to the change in attenuation spectrum (23Kim N. Ripple M.O. Springett R. Spectral components of the α-band of cytochrome oxidase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) over the wavelength range 520–630 nm.

Acta. 2011; 1807: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and a quadratic background to account for any base-line drift. All model spectra were measured from the isolated enzymes except a602 (see Ref. 23Kim N. Ripple M.O. Springett R. Spectral components of the α-band of cytochrome oxidase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1807: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The b560 heme of complex II is not included in the model because it has a midpoint potential of −185mV (24Yu L. Xu J.X. Haley P.E. Yu C.A. Properties of bovine heart mitochondrial cytochrome b560.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1137-1143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and so is unlikely to be reduced in the absence of exogenous reductants. The oxidized fraction of each heme (oxidation state) was calculated from the oxidation changes assuming full reduction during anoxia and full oxidation at high oxygen tension after addition of 1 μm complex I inhibitor rotenone. NADH oxidation changes were calculated by fitting a linear combination of model spectra to the fluorescence intensity spectrum over the wavelength range 410–610 nm. The model spectra were the fluorescence spectrum of NADH, the fluorescence spectrum of the RPMI 1640 medium and a linear background. The NADH signal originates from both NADH and NADPH in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. The oxidation state of mitochondrial NADH was calculated from oxidation changes assuming full reduction of mitochondrial NADH during anoxia and full oxidation of mitochondrial NADH after 1 mm complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid, which inhibits the TCA cycle, and 1 μm protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), assuming that NADPH and cytosolic NADH did not change with these interventions. Aliquots containing of 2.0 × 106 cells were removed from the chamber and immediately combined with 500 μl of cold PBS, centrifuged at 4.3 × g for 90 s, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer heated to 75 °C and heated for 5 min. The proteins were separated on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and transferred to an Immobilon P membrane. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% milk. Primary antibodies were diluted in TBST and 5% milk or BSA and exposed to the blot overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies ERK and phosphor-ERK (Thr-202, Tyr-204) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Blots were washed in TBST three times and exposed to fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies, mouse IgG IRDye800 (Rockland), and rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 680, for 45 min. Blots were washed in TBST three times and once in TBS before being read on an Odyssey Imaging System (LiCor). Blots were analyzed and quantitated using custom software that corrects the fluorescence intensity of a protein band for the fluorescence intensity above and below the band. The amount of phosphorylated ERK1/2 fluorescence per total ERK1/2 fluorescence is expressed in the data, but it should be noted that this value is only proportional to the pERK1/2/total ERK1/2 due to differences in the efficiency of detection. MEK inhibitors slowed the proliferation of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner that varied with inhibitor (Fig. 1A). Exponentially growing HL-60 cells were treated with 1 nm-300 μm inhibitor for 48 h, and the number of viable cells was calculated and related to the proliferation of vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells. PD198306 showed a slightly stronger inhibition of proliferation per dose than MIIC and U0126. All three of these drugs were more potent at inhibiting proliferation than PD98059, a first generation MEK1/2 inhibitor. A 50% inhibition of proliferation was detected with 300 μm PD98059, the highest concentration tested (Fig. 1A). U0126 and MIIC, at 30 μm, inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells by 67 and 77%, respectively. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, the only known substrates of MEK1/2, is the standard assay of MEK1/2 activity. To determine the MEK1/2 activity of inhibitor-treated HL-60 cells, total cell extracts were made 2 min after exposure to 1–100 μm inhibitor. Western analysis indicated that little or no pERK1/2 was found following 1 μm MIIC, U0126, and PD198306 and 100 μm PD98059 (Fig. 1B). Multiwavelength cell spectroscopy was used to quantitate oxidation changes of the ETC hemes simultaneously with oxygen consumption (VO2). A typical study is shown in Fig. 2 where a downward deflection in Cytc denotes reduction and an upward deflection denotes oxidation. Oxygen concentration within the chamber was maintained at 100 μm (∼10% O2) except in the gray shaded area where the O2 concentration was altered under computer control. [O2] was decreased to zero (anoxia) and maintained there for 2 min then returned to 100 μm. Under anoxic conditions, electrons are not able to leave the chain, and all of the upstream redox centers, including Cytc, become fully reduced (Fig. 2, A and B). The addition of 1 μm rotenone, a complex I inhibitor, blocked entry of electrons into the chain, resulting in a complete oxidation of Cytc and blocked all mitochondrial VO2 (Fig. 2, A and B). The heme oxidation states were subsequently calculated assuming that the hemes were fully reduced and fully oxidized under anoxia and rotenone, respectively. The addition of U0126 indicated by the arrows, to final concentrations of 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μm, resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in VO2 and oxidation of Cytc (Fig. 2, B and D). At base line 62 ± 1% of Cytc, 69 ± 4% of bH of the bc1 complex (complex III) and 89 ± 3% of CytOx were oxidized (Fig. 3, top). DMSO, given as a vehicle control, slightly increased VO2 but did not appreciably change the cytochrome oxidation state (Fig. 3, left). The addition of MIIC and U0126 caused a dose-dependent oxidation of Cytc, bH, and CytOx (Fig. 3, top). Cytc was 97.5 ± 0.3% and 88.5 ± 0.2% oxidized after 10 μm MIIC and U0126, respectively, and nearly fully oxidized after 30 μm. The bL and c1 hemes of the bc1 complex also oxidized in concert with the other hemes (data not shown). The oxidation was rapid and stabilized within 90 s (Fig. 2D). PD98059 also oxidized the hemes but required more drug, 30 μm and higher, to do so. PD198306, a newer generation MEK1/2 inhibitor, had little effect on the heme oxidation state until the highest concentration, 30 μm. A dose-dependent decrease in VO2 was noted following treatment with MIIC or U0126 (Fig. 3, bottom). Similarly, PD98059 decreased VO2 but required a greater concentration of drug. In contrast, PD198306 first increased VO2 at moderate concentrations (3 and 10 μm) and then decreased VO2 at the highest concentration (30 μm), where it also oxidized Cytc and bH. U0124, sold as a small molecule control for U0126 studies, had no effect VO2 or cytochrome oxidation state (data not shown). A direct linear correlation, R>0.99, between Cytc oxidation and VO2 was found for MIIC, U0126, and PD98059 (Fig. 3, lower left). As each of these compounds was added Cytc oxidation increased in concert with a decrease in VO2. The results suggest that these inhibitors have the same mechanism of action on the mitochondria. The oxidation of all ETC hemes along with inhibition of VO2 indicated that the MEK1/2 inhibitors were disrupting the ETC upstream of complex III. Similar to the hemes, NAD+ and NADH are a redox couple where NADH is the reduced form (carrying two electrons) and NAD+ is the oxidized form. To determine whether the inhibition was occurring at complex I or upstream of complex I, the oxidation state of NAD(H) was measured fluorometrically. Treatment with MIIC and U0126 resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in NAD(H) which was significant starting at 0.1 μm and 1 μm (p < 0.005), respectively (Fig. 3, lower right). The effect of PD98059 could not be determined because the drug itself fluoresced. U0126 also fluoresced, but it could be spectrally resolved. PD198306 resulted in an oxidation in NAD(H) at 10 μm. The concentration of each inhibitor required to reduce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 to ≤5% of base line produced only a 10–25% decrease in proliferation compared with vehicle-treated control cells at 48 h (Fig. 4A, gray section). Improved proliferative inhibition to 80% of control occurred at higher doses, with little or no further decrease in pERK1/2 levels. For the inhibitors MIIC, U0126, and PD98059 this improved proliferative inhibition strongly correlated with the oxidation of Cytc and a decrease in VO2 (Fig. 4, B and C). These changes are indicative of inhibition of the ETC. Similarly, PD198306 inhibits proliferation by just 25% when pERK1/2 is <5% of control. A greater proliferative inhibition was noted at higher doses, which did not decrease pERK1/2 levels further but did alter mitochondrial function. Rotenone, an established complex I inhibitor, caused no decrease in pERK1/2/ERK1/2 although there was significant inhibition of proliferation at 48 h to 18 ± 6% of vehicle-treated control cells, suggesting loss of pERK1/2 is not necessary for complex I inhibition (Fig. 4, D and F). As expected, 1 μm rotenone fully oxidized Cytc and inhibited VO2 to 6.2 ± 2.4% of control; the residual VO2 was nonmitochondrial in origin (Fig. 4E). Another known complex I inhibitor, pyridaben (1 μm), also oxidized Cytc, abolished mitochondrial VO2, and inhibited proliferation to 44 ± 4% of control (data not shown), showing that complex I inhibition robustly affects proliferation. At 1 μm, MIIC and U0126 had only modest effects on proliferation despite lowering pERK1/2/ERK1/2 to <2.5% of control levels. This concentration caused partial inhibition of complex I as indicated by the intermediate inhibition of VO2 and oxidation of ETC cytochromes (Figs. 4E and 3). At a higher concentration of 10 μm, MIIC and U0126 further decreased VO2 and further inhibited proliferation but caused no detectable change in pERK1/2/ERK1/2 (Fig. 4, D–F), suggesting that the robust inhibition of proliferation is dependent on complex I inhibition. In contrast, the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 at 10 μm inhibited pERK1/2/ERK1/2 to 11.3 ± 4.6% of control but had little effect on VO2, Cytc oxidation, or on proliferation, again suggesting that lowering pERK1/2/ERK1/2 alone has little effect on proliferation. Together these data support the requirement of complex I activity over pERK1/2 expression for maintenance of proliferation. Using a new technology that provides a real-time depiction of mitochondrial metabolism in intact cells via measurements of NAD(H) oxidation state, heme oxidation states, and oxygen consumption, we found that several structurally distinct MEK1/2 inhibitors acutely and effectively altered mitochondrial metabolism. Three of the inhibitors tested, U0126, MIIC, and PD98059, had dose-dependent immediate effects on complex I of the ETC. Another MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD198306, acted acutely as a protonophore. As expected, all of the MEK1/2 inhibitors blocked phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in a dose-dependent manner, and all slowed the proliferation of HL-60 human leukemia cells. Notably, the depletion of pERK1/2 to levels <5% of control correlated with just a 10–25% decrease in proliferation compared with control. Further proliferative inhibition, down to 80% of control, occurred at higher doses of inhibitor and correlated strongly with the effects on the mitochondrial electron transport. The immediate, dose-dependent reduction in NAD(H) and oxidation in heme bH of complex III, Cytc, and heme a of CytOx, as well as the corresponding decrease in VO2 caused by MIIC, U0126, and PD98059 are hallmarks of complex I inhibition. Such inhibition would explain the increase in the ADP:ATP ratio found in HEK293 cells treated with U0126 and PD98059 (25Dokladda K. Green K.A. Pan D.A. Hardie D.G. PD98059 and U0126 activate AMP-activated protein kinase by increasing the cellular AMP:ATP ratio and not via inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). U0126 also caused Cytc oxidation and inhibited VO2 in a normal mouse macrophage cell line, RAW264.7, and in two other human myeloid leukemia cell lines, ML-1 and AML-3 (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition of complex I is not specific to HL-60 cells. In addition, we found that U0126 oxidized Cytc and inhibited VO2 in isolated HL-60 mitochondria (data not shown), suggesting that U0126 acts to inhibit complex I independently of cytoplasmic MEK1/2. At least 60 different families of compounds have been found to inhibit complex I, highlighting its sensitivity to a vast variety of structurally unrelated natural and artificial compounds (26Degli Esposti M. Inhibitors of NADH-ubiquinone reductase: an overview.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The oxidation of Cytc in HL-60 cells was maintained for at least 2 days following a single dose of U0126 (data not shown), suggesting that the inhibition is prolonged. It is possible that the structurally distinct inhibitors U0126, MIIC, and PD98059 bind directly to complex I. Alternatively, inhibition could be occurring through a signaling event. Such a signaling cascade would require a terminal signaling protein with access to complex I and therefore present in either the mitochondrial intermembrane space or the mitochondrial matrix. There have been several reports of the presence of ERK1/2 in mitochondria, but it is difficult to reconcile the mitochondrial location of ERK1/2 with the impermeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to proteins lacking a mitochondrial import sequence (27Wortzel I. Seger R. The ERK cascade: distinct functions within various subcellular organelles.Genes Cancer. 2011; 2: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 28Nowak G. Clifton G.L. Godwin M.L.

Mitochondrial protein import: from transport pathways to an integrated network.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2012; 37: 85-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In any case, inhibition of complex I by MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 can be ruled out because low dose PD198306 resulted in the profound loss of pERK1/2, presumably indicating complete inhibition of MEK1/2 kinase activity, with no observable inhibition of complex I. Kinase inhibitors are notoriously nonspecific, and it remains possible that these compounds are targeting a kinase within the mitochondria whose physiological substrate is complex I. The mammalian complex I contains 45 subunits (30Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A. The architecture of respiratory complex I.Nature. 2010; 465: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and some of the subunits reportedly contain phosphorylation sites (31Papa S.

Proteomics. 2005; 4: 84-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of a protonophore decrease the membrane potential and stimulate respiration whereas high concentrations cause a decrease in respiration concomitant with a failure in the TCA cycle to reduce NADH (34Steinlechner-Maran R. Eberl T. Kunc M. Margreiter R. Gnaiger E. Oxygen dependence of respiration in coupled and uncoupled endothelial cells.Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C2053-C2061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous work with the protonophore CCCP has shown the Cytc oxidation state changes very little at low concentrations, where VO2 increases, but becomes highly oxidized at higher concentrations where VO2 decreases (35Kim N. Ripple M.O. Springett R. Measurement of the mitochondrial membrane potential and pH gradient from the redox Poise of the hemes of the bc1 complex.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 1194-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PD198306 produced exactly this pattern of oxidation and electron flux changes consistent with it acting as a protonophore. Increases in VO2 can also arise if ATP consumption is increased, but the changes observed with PD198306 also occurred in the presence of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, indicating that ATP consumption is not driving the increased VO2 (data not shown). Similar to CCCP and another protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), PD198306 contains a secondary amine group which, in this case, bridges two benzene rings. Loss of the proton on the amine group would lead to a negative charge that would be delocalized over the two benzene rings, thus explaining the protonophore activity at higher concentrations. It should be noted that PD198306 is a structural analog of the MEK1/2 inhibitors, CI-1040 and MEK162, used in clinical trials. In summary, the role of the MAPK signaling pathway in cellular proliferation is well established, and the overexpression or activation of the upstream components of this pathway in certain cancers is undeniable; however, the use of MEK1/2-specific inhibitors to define the function of this pathway must be accepted with caution. As we have clearly shown, MEK1/2 inhibitors of diverse structure can alter mitochondrial metabolism in addition to depleting pERK1/2. Because the reduction of pERK1/2 to <5% of base line corresponded to only a 10–25% decrease in proliferation compared with control regardless of the inhibitor used and because the mitochondrial inhibition continued to correlate with enhanced proliferative inhibition, we propose a prominent role for mitochondrial-mediated proliferative control by these inhibitors. The concentrations used to obtain this level of proliferative inhibition were consistent with those published in the majority of literature related to these MEK1/2 inhibitors (36Ripple M.O.

Therefore, it is likely that many of the antiproliferative effects associated with these inhibitors are due to inhibition of mitochondrial function rather than strictly being mediated by the loss of pERK1/2."
https://openalex.org/W1987415729,"Introduction Consequences of lack of viral monitoring in predicting the effects of development of HIV drug resistance mutations during HAART in resource-limited settings (RLS) is still a matter of debate. Design To assess, among HIV+ patients receiving their first-line HAART, prevalence of virological failure and genotypic resistance mutations pattern in a Médécins Sans Frontières/Ministry of Health programme in Busia District (Kenya). Methods Patients with HAART treatment for ≥12 months were eligible for the study and those with HIV-RNA ≥5000 copies/ml underwent genotypic study. Total HIV-1 RNA from Dried Blood Spots was extracted using Nuclisens method. Results 926 patients were included. Among 274 (29.6%) patients with detectable viral load, 55 (5.9%) experienced treatment failure (viral load >5.000 copies/ml); 61.8% were female and 10 (18.2%) had clinical failure. Median CD4 cell count was 116 cell/mm3 (IQR: 54–189). Median HIV-RNA was 32,000 copies/ml (IQR: 11000–68000). Eighteen out of 55 (33%) samples could be sequenced on PR and RT genes, with resistance associated mutations (RAMs) in 15 out of 18 samples (83%). Among patients carrying RAMs, 12/15 (81%) harboured RAMs associated to thymidine analogues (TAMs). All of them (100%) showed M184V resistance associated mutation to lamivudine as well as NNRTI's RAMS. Conclusions Virological failure rate in resource-limited settings are similar to those observed in developed countries. Resistance mutation patterns were concordant with HAART received by failing patients. Long term detectable viral load confers greater probability of developing resistance and as a consequence, making difficult to find out a cost-effective subsequent treatment regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2138153168,"It is well known that the outcome of an intervention is affected both by the inherent effects of the intervention and the patient's expectations. For this reason in comparative clinical trials an effort is made to conceal the nature of the administered intervention from the participants in the trial i.e. to blind the trial. Yet, in practice perfect blinding is impossible to ensure or even verify post hoc. The current clinical standard is to follow up the trial with an auxiliary questionnaire, which allows trial participants to express in closed form their belief concerning the intervention, i.e. trial group assignment (treatment or control). Auxiliary questionnaire responses are then used to compute the extent of blinding in the trial in the form of a blinding index. If the estimated extent of blinding exceeds a particular threshold the trial is deemed sufficiently blinded; otherwise, the strength of evidence of the trial is brought into question. This may necessitate that the trial is repeated. In this paper we make several contributions. Firstly, we identify a series of problems of the aforesaid clinical practice and discuss them in context of the most commonly used blinding indexes. Secondly, we formulate a novel approach for handling imperfectly blinded trials. We adopt a feedback questionnaire of the same form as that which is currently in use, but interpret the collected data using a novel statistical method, significantly different from that proposed in the previous work. Unlike the previously proposed approaches, our method is void of any ad hoc free parameters and robust to small changes in the participants' feedback responses. Our method also does not discard any data and is not predicated on any strong assumptions used to interpret participants' feedback. The key idea behind the present method is that it is meaningful to compare only the corresponding treatment and control participant sub-groups, that is, sub-groups matched by their auxiliary responses. A series of experiments on simulated trials is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its superiority over those currently in use."
https://openalex.org/W1967053832,"β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins that, upon recruitment to an activated G-protein-coupled receptor, can promote desensitization of G-protein signaling and receptor internalization while simultaneously eliciting an independent signal. The result of β-arrestin signaling depends upon the activating receptor. For example, activation of two Gαq-coupled receptors, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) and neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), results in drastically different signaling events. PAR2 promotes β-arrestin-dependent membrane-sequestered extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation, cofilin activation, and cell migration, whereas NK1R promotes nuclear ERK1/2 activation and proliferation. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer to monitor receptor/β-arrestin interactions in real time, we observe that PAR2 has a higher apparent affinity for both β-arrestins than does NK1R, recruits them at a faster rate, and exhibits more rapid desensitization of the G-protein signal. Furthermore, recruitment of β-arrestins to PAR2 does not require prior Gαq signaling events, whereas inhibition of Gαq signaling intermediates inhibits recruitment of β-arrestins to NK1R. Using chimeric receptors in which the C terminus of PAR2 is fused to the N terminus of NK1R and vice versa and a critical Ser/Thr mutant of PAR2, we demonstrate that interactions between β-arrestins and specific phosphoresidues in the C termini of each receptor are crucial for determining the rate and magnitude of β-arrestin recruitment as well as the ultimate signaling outcome.Background: Many GPCRs that utilize β-arrestins differ with respect to downstream signaling and cellular consequences.Results: Exchanging the C termini of two GPCRs switches the β-arrestin responses and relative affinities for the two receptors.Conclusion: Sequences within the C termini of different GPCRs are important for determining the nature of β-arrestin recruitment and signaling.Significance: These studies provide new insight regarding receptor-specific β-arrestin signals. β-Arrestins are multifunctional adaptor proteins that, upon recruitment to an activated G-protein-coupled receptor, can promote desensitization of G-protein signaling and receptor internalization while simultaneously eliciting an independent signal.

Significance: These studies provide new insight regarding receptor-specific β-arrestin signals. β-Arrestins are pleiotropic adaptor proteins that can terminate heterotrimeric G-protein signaling, promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and bind numerous signaling proteins to enhance or inhibit their activities, downstream of many seven-transmembrane receptors.

The two receptors differ both in their mechanism of activation of ERK1/2 and the downstream consequences of ERK1/2 activity. PAR2 is activated by serine protease-mediated cleavage of its N terminus, which reveals a tethered ligand that then binds and activates the receptor. Peptides corresponding to the tethered ligand sequence (SLI(G/K)(V/L)NH2) and peptidomimetics, such as 2-furoyl-LIGRLNH2 (2fAP) can be used to specifically activate PAR2 in the absence of proteolytic cleavage (6Al-Ani B.

Furthermore, despite the common involvement of Gαq and β-arrestins, the mechanisms by which the two receptors activate ERK1/2 are distinctly different. PAR2 can promote ERK1/2 activation by independent G-protein- and β-arrestin-dependent mechanisms, the former requiring Src and Ras and the latter requiring neither (1DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D.

In contrast, NK1R requires input from both G-protein- and β-arrestin-dependent pathways for Src and Ras-dependent activation of ERK1/2, suggesting that PAR2 might recruit β-arrestins independent of G-protein coupling, whereas NK1R may rely on G-protein-mediated events for β-arrestin recruitment (1DeFea K.A.

We hypothesized that the differences in ERK1/2 activation by the two receptors and the subsequent downstream events might be dependent upon interactions between β-arrestin-1/2 and the receptor C termini, which might in turn be dependent upon the phosphorylation state of the receptors. To address this possibility, we switched the C-tails of the two receptors and examined Ca2+ mobilization, β-arrestin recruitment kinetics, ERK1/2 activation and localization, and two downstream signaling events: proliferation and cell migration. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The following primary antibodies were used for Western blotting, immunostaining, or in-cell Western assays: mouse monoclonal antibodies to FLAG M2 (Sigma, 1:100 for in-cell Western, 1:250 for IF); rabbit anti-phosphocofilin (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 for WB); mouse anti-total cofilin (BD Biosciences, 1:1000 for WB); rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and mouse anti-total ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, 1:1000 for WB and in-cell Western, 1:250 for IF); mouse monoclonal antibody to EEA-1 (BD Biosciences, 1:250 for IF); rabbit anti-LAMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

IRDye®680- and IRDye®800-tagged secondary antibodies (1:45,000 for WB) were from Rockland. 2-Furoyl-LIGRLO-NH2, Sar-Met-SP, U73122, and BAPTA-AM were purchased from Tocris. FLAG-tagged PAR2WT and PAR2S363A/T366A in the pBJ1 vector, Renilla luciferase-tagged β-arrestin-1 and -2 constructs, and FLAG-tagged β-arrestin-1 and -2 constructs were obtained as gifts from Dr. JoAnn Trejo (University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA), Dr. Michel Bouvier (University of Montreal), and Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University Medical Center), respectively.

The C termini of PAR2 (nucleotide 1081 to the end) and NK1R (nucleotide 1227 to the end) were amplified by PCR with primers containing N-terminal EcoRI and C-terminal BamHI sites, digested, and ligated into eGFP-N1 to generate NK1RC-GFP and PAR2C-GFP. The N termini of PAR2 (nucleotides 1–1080) and NK1R (nucleotides 1–1226) were amplified by PCR with N-terminal HindIII and C-terminal EcoRI sites, digested, and ligated into EcoRI/HindIII-digested NK1RC-GFP and PAR2C-GFP, respectively. Sequences and reading frames across the fusion junction were confirmed by ABI sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild type and β-arrestin-1/2 double knock-out mice (from Robert Lefkowitz), and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were maintained as described previously (3Kumar P.

All plasmids were stably transfected in CHO cells using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. Stable CHO cell lines were selected by flow cytometry and were not single cell clonal cell lines. Transient transfections were carried out using FuGene (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were preloaded with Fura-2, washed, and mounted in a perfusion chamber on the stage of a Nikon TE300 microscope, and Ca2+ mobilization was determined as described previously (3Kumar P. Lau C.S. Mathur M. Wang P. DeFea K.A. Differential effects of β-arrestins on the internalization, desensitization and ERK1/2 activation downstream of protease activated receptor-2.Am. J. Physiol.

Briefly, either 2fAP or Sar-Met-SP was added to the bath, and fluorescence was detected in individual cells using a Nikon video camera and a video microscopy program (Metafluor). Fluorescence was quantified at 340- and 380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission. The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to the [Ca2+], was determined. To determine maximum Ca2+ levels, readings were followed by the addition of the calcium ionophore ionomycin. For determination of the amount of calcium response (or the duration of signaling), areas under the calcium response curves were determined using Kaleidagraph (version 4.0), and total [Ca2+] released was calculated using the Grynkiewitz equation, [Ca2+]i=Kd×(R−Rmin)/(Rmax−R)×Sf2/Sb2(Eq. 1) where Kd (for Ca2+ binding to Fura-2/AM) = 220 nm, R = A340/A380 at each time point, Rmin = A340/A380 under Ca2+-free conditions, Rmax = A340/A380 at saturating conditions (with the addition of ionomycin), Sf2 represents the base-line fluorescence at 340 nm without Fura, and Sb2 represents the base-line fluorescence at 340 nm with Fura. YFP-tagged receptor constructs were transiently co-expressed with either β-arrestin-1-luciferase or β-arrestin-2-luciferase in HEK293 cells. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with appropriate concentrations of 2fAP or Sar-Met-SP and 5 μm coelenterazine. For dose curves, coelenterazine was added, and readings were taken 15 min after agonist stimulation. For kinetic measurements, agonist and coelenterazine were added simultaneously, and readings were initiated at that time. Pharmacological inhibitors were added at appropriate concentrations, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C 10 min prior to the addition of 2fAP. Light emission was detected (460–500 nm for RLuc and 510–550 nm for YFP) using a TRISTAR LB941 multilabel plate reader from Berthold Technologies. BRET signal was calculated as the ratio of the light emitted by eYFP and the light emitted by luciferase. For a negative control, cells transfected with the β-arrestin-luciferase construct alone were used to determine the background. The ratio observed in β-arrestin luciferase-only-transfected cells was subtracted from that observed in the presence of YFP-tagged receptors to give the net BRET values. Half-lives (t½) of the kinetics reactions were determined from five separate experiments. For titration curves, β-arrestin was held constant and co-transfected with increasing amounts of YFP-tagged receptor; BRET readings were taken for each acceptor/donor ratio as described for dose curves but using a constant concentration of 1 μm 2fAP. Protein expression levels were confirmed by luciferase emission and YFP fluorescence, respectively. For pERK assays, cells were seeded into 96-well plates, serum-starved overnight, and then stimulated with 2fAP or Sar-Met-SP for 0–60 min, after which they were fixed, blocked, and incubated with anti-rabbit pERK and anti-mouse total ERK1/2 overnight at 4 °C. For cell surface receptor detection, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector, FLAG-tagged PAR2WT, or PAR2S363A/T366A, transferred to 24-well plates, fixed, blocked, and incubated with mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Following incubation with IRDye680 and IRDye800-conjugated secondary antibodies, the plates were scanned using the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system, and the integrated intensities of the wells were quantified using the LI-COR software. For the receptor internalization assays, 3 × 104 CHO cells stably expressing GFP-tagged receptors were cultured overnight on collagen-coated coverslips. When required, the cells were transiently transfected with DsRed-ERK1/2 or FLAG-tagged β-arrestin-1 or -2. 36 h post-transfection, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM, and the cells were treated with appropriate agonists (i.e. 1 μm 2fAP or 100 nm Sar-Met-SP) for 0–120 min, fixed, and blocked, and immunostaining was carried out as described previously (3Kumar P. Lau C.S. Mathur M. Wang P. DeFea K.A. Differential effects of β-arrestins on the internalization, desensitization and ERK1/2 activation downstream of protease activated receptor-2.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C346-C357Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CHO cells stably expressing GFP-tagged PAR2, NK1R, PAR2-NK1R, NK1R-PAR2, and HEK293 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged PAR2WT or PAR2S363A/T366A were used in these assays. 3 × 104 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated transwell supports (8-μm pore size) and allowed to attach for 2 h at 37 °C and then treated with 10 μm 2fAP or 100 nm Sar-Met-SP, added to the lower chambers, for 4 h. Non-migratory cells were removed with a cotton swab, filters were stained with crystal violet, and the total number of cells that migrated to the bottom was quantified counting in four fields of vision under the ×20 objective of a Nikon phase-contrast microscope. Alternatively, cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and serum-starved overnight, and a wound was generated by scratching across a monolayer with a 10-μl pipette tip. After treatment with or without 1 μm 2fAP for 6–24 h, cell migration into the wound area was monitored using the ×4 objective of a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope. The wound area was quantified using ImageJ software (wound area at time 0 minus the wound area at each time point). The migration index was calculated as a -fold change in area covered by cells at the 0 min time point over that at the 24 h time point. 104 CHO cells expressing GFP-tagged PAR2, NK1R, PAR2-NK1R, and NK1R-PAR2 were seeded onto 35-mm dishes, attached for 2 h, and serum-starved overnight and then treated with 2fAP, Sar-Met-SP, or serum (positive control) for 48 h. Cells were detached, stained with propidium iodide, and resuspended in 1 ml of flow cytometry buffer. Cells per ml were determined using a Beckman flow cytometer. Cell number was determined by multiplying the number of propidium iodide-excluding GFP-positive cells times the total volume. Untransfected cells were used to determine the gating strategy for identifying GFP-positive cells. To determine the importance of the receptor C termini in directing specific β-arrestin-dependent signaling events, we constructed chimeric receptors, in which either the cytoplasmic C terminus of PAR2 was fused to the N terminus of NK1R at the seventh transmembrane domain (NK1R-PAR2) or the C terminus of NK1R was fused to the N terminus of PAR2 (PAR2-NK1R) (Fig. 1A). They were expressed in CHO cells, and agonist-induced Ca2+ mobilization was determined using Fura-2/AM (PAR2 and PAR2-NK1R received 2fAP, and NK1R and NK1R-PAR2 received Sar-Met-SP). Mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores is an early signaling event downstream of Gαq-coupled receptors, such as PAR2 and NK1R, and is rapidly terminated upon β-arrestin recruitment. Thus, Ca2+ mobilization is often used as a read-out for Gαq-coupled receptor activation and for examining defects in desensitization (1DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Déry O.

https://openalex.org/W2089692933,"We recently showed that the developmentally important family of SOX (SRY (sex determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high mobility group (HMG) box) proteins require the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) for optimal nuclear accumulation, with clinical mutations in SRY that specifically impair nuclear accumulation via this pathway resulting in XY sex reversal. However, the mechanism by which CaM facilitates nuclear accumulation is unknown. Here, we show, for the first time, that the 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein hsc70 plays a key role in CaM-dependent nuclear import of SRY. Using a reconstituted nuclear import assay, we show that antibodies to hsc70 significantly reduce nuclear accumulation of wild type SRY and mutant derivatives thereof that retain CaM-dependent nuclear import, with an increased rate of nuclear accumulation upon addition of both CaM and hsc70, in contrast to an SRY mutant derivative with impaired CaM binding. siRNA knockdown of hsc70 in intact cells showed similar results, indicating clear dependence upon hsc70 for CaM-dependent nuclear import. Analysis using the technique of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicated that hsc70 is required for the maximal rate of SRY nuclear import in living cells but has no impact upon SRY nuclear retention/nuclear dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate direct binding of hsc70 to the SRY·CaM complex, with immunoprecipitation experiments from cell extracts showing association of hsc70 with wild type SRY, but not with a mutant derivative with impaired CaM binding, dependent on Ca(2+). Our novel findings strongly implicate hsc70 in CaM-dependent nuclear import of SRY."
https://openalex.org/W2032772918,"Squamous lung carcinoma lacks specific “ad hoc” therapies. Amplification of chromosome 3q is the most common genomic aberration and this region harbours genes having role as novel targets for therapeutics. There is no standard definition on how to score and report 3q amplification. False versus true 3q chromosomal amplification in squamous cell lung carcinoma may have tremendous impact on trials involving drugs which target DNA zones mapping on 3q. Forty squamous lung carcinomas were analyzed by FISH to assess chromosome 3q amplification. aCGH was performed as gold-standard to avoid false positive amplifications. Three clustered patterns of fluorescent signals were observed. Eight cases out of 40 (20%) showed ≥8 3q signals. Twenty out of 40 (50%) showed from 3 to 7 signals. The remaining showed two fluorescent signals (30%). When corrected by whole chromosome 3 signals, only cases with ≥8 signals maintained a LSI 3q/CEP3 ratio >2. Only the cases showing 3q amplification by aCGH (+3q25.3−3q27.3) showed ≥8 fluorescent signals at FISH evidencing a 3q/3 ratio >2. The remaining cases showed flat genomic portrait at aCGH on chromosome 3. We concluded that: 1) absolute copy number of 3q chromosomal region may harbour false positive interpretation of 3q amplification in squamous cell carcinoma; 2) a case results truly “amplified for chromosome 3q” when showing ≥8 fluorescent 3q signals; 3) trials involving drugs targeting loci on chromosome 3q in squamous lung carcinoma therapy have to consider false versus true 3q chromosomal amplification."

We hypothesized that the reported risk variants may be associated with tumor genomic instability. To explore potential correlations between germline risk variants and somatic genetic events, we analyzed matched tumor and blood samples from 95 glioma patients by means of SNP genotyping. The generated genotype data was used to calculate genome-wide allele-specific copy number profiles of the tumor samples. We compared the copy number profiles across samples and found two EGFR gene variants (rs17172430 and rs11979158) that were associated with homozygous deletion at the CDKN2A/B locus. One of the EGFR variants (rs17172430) was also associated with loss of heterozygosity at the EGFR locus. Our findings were confirmed in a separate dataset consisting of matched blood and tumor samples from 300 glioblastoma patients, compiled from publically available TCGA data. These results imply there is a functional effect of germline EGFR variants on tumor progression."

Background: There are conflicting models for how intracellular Ca2+ allosterically regulates Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Results: The model of reorientation of the two Ca2+ binding domains upon Ca2+ binding in the NCX1.4 isoform is not supported by data for NCX1.1. Conclusion: There is motivation to further evaluate the mechanism(s) of Ca2+ activation of NCX1.1. Significance: Control of Ca2+ efflux in cardiomyocytes is vital for cardiac physiology. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCX.1.1 plays a major role in the cardiac contractile cycle via efflux of Ca2+ from the cardiomyocyte after its transient rise during systole. Under normal physiological conditions, the exchanger utilizes the electrochemical Na+ gradient to extrude one Ca2+ ion for influx of three Na+ ions (1Kang T.M. Hilgemann D.W. Multiple transport modes of the cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.Nature. 2004; 427: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This exchange process is vital to proper timing of the Ca2+ transient as studies have provided evidence that some cardiac arrhythmias are related to altered exchanger properties and that the exchanger has atypical function in heart failure (2Piacentino 3rd, V. Weber C.R. Chen X. Weisser-Thomas J. Margulies K.B. Bers D.M. Houser S.R. Cellular basis of abnormal calcium transients of failing human ventricular myocytes.Circ.

Res. 2003; 57: 974-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). NCX1.1 is regulated by the same ions that it exchanges. Previous studies have shown that intracellular Na+ can inactivate the exchanger (5Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. Steady-state and dynamic properties of cardiac sodium-calcium exchange. Sodium depenent inactivation.J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 905-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Conversely, intracellular Ca2+ overcomes the Na+-dependent inactivation and leads to the physiologically important increase in exchange activity (6Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S.

Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This activation is vital to proper cardiomyocyte function. There are a number of splice variants of the NCX1 family of proteins with the ACDEF splice variant (NCX1.1) being the form expressed in cardiomyocytes (7Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W.

Studies over the past decade have led to characterization of the two tandem regulatory Ca2+ binding domains, denoted Ca2+ binding domain 1 (CBD1) and Ca2+ binding domain 2 (CBD2), which are located in the central portion of the primary sequence of the large intracellular domain (e.g. Ref. 7Hilge M.

Most structural studies to date have been carried out on the AD splice variant of CBD2, which has a shorter F-G loop between β-strands F and G than the ACDEF splice variant that is expressed in cardiomyocytes. Collectively, these studies have led to identification of the regions of the proteins that show changes in structure and dynamics upon Ca2+ binding to both isolated domains. Even though the atomic resolution structures of the isolated CBD1 and CBD2-AD are well established, the molecular mechanism of how binding of Ca2+ regulates exchanger activity remains uncertain. Recent studies by Hilge et al. (12Hilge M. Aelen J. Foarce A. Perrakis A. Vuister G.W. Ca2+ regulation in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger features a dual electrostatic switch mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14333-14338Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have led to the proposal that Ca2+ regulation of the exchanger involves a dual electrostatic switch mechanism where binding of Ca2+ to both CBD1 and CBD2-AD is required for structural rearrangements within CBD12 and that this could be the basis for regulation of exchanger activity. Small angle x-ray scattering data in this same study suggested that a similar structural rearrangement might also occur in the ACDEF splice variant. In both isoforms the small angle x-ray scattering data suggested that Ca2+ binding led to a more compact structure where the N- and C-terminal ends were closer together. Ottolia and co-workers (16John S.A. Ribalet B. Weiss J.N. Philipson K.D. Ottolia M. Ca2+-dependent structural rearrangements within Na+-Ca2+ exchanger dimers.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 1699-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have reported Ca2+-dependent changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency in a CBD12 construct that was targeted to the plasma membrane in Xenopus laevis oocytes by fusion to a Ki-Ras sequence (15Aurora R. Rose G.D. Helix capping.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In this construct, the fluorescent proteins CFP and YFP were incorporated into CBD12 at the N and C termini, respectively, to serve as the donor-acceptor pair. The results from these FRET studies were interpreted as evidence for a Ca2+-dependent increase in distance between the N- and C-terminal ends. Brüschweiler and co-workers have reported an extensive study of the structure and dynamics of full-length CBD12-AD by NMR (17Salinas R.K. Bruschweiler-Li L. Johnson E. Brüschweiler R. Ca2+ binding alters the interdomain flexibility between the two cytoplasmic calcium binding domains in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32123-32131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Two important conclusions were provided in these studies. First, in the AD splice variant of NCX1, CBD1 and CBD2 are arranged in a nearly linear fashion relative to each other in both the Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free forms. Second, the two Ca2+ binding domains of full-length CBD12 are joined by a rigid linker in the presence of Ca2+. However, in the absence of Ca2+, the linker (amino acids 501–503) becomes more flexible, allowing the two domains to rotate somewhat independently of each other, giving rise to an ensemble of dynamic structures centered about the more static elongated structure that exists in the presence of Ca2+. Based upon their observations, it was hypothesized that this transition from a flexible link between CBD1 and CBD2 in the absence of Ca2+ to a rigid link in the Ca2+-bound form might be the origin of the signal that is transmitted to the transmembrane domain to allosterically regulate Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Zheng and co-workers (18Wu M. Tong S. Gonzalez J. Jayaraman V. Spudich J.L. Zheng L. Structural basis of the Ca2+ inhibition mechanism of Drosophila Na+/Ca2+ exchanger CALX and its modification by alternative splicing.Structure. 2011; 19: 1509-1517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) obtained x-ray crystal structures of CBD12 from two different splice variants of CALX, a NCX homolog expressed in Drosophila sensory neurons. Despite a high degree of sequence homology between CBD12 in CALX and the mammalian NCXs, binding of intracellular Ca2+ to both CALX splice variants (CALX 1.1 and 1.2) results in inhibition of Na+/Ca2+ exchange rather than stimulation. Based upon the results from the crystal structures and additional Ca2+ binding analysis, it was proposed that the Ca2+ regulatory signal involves interdomain conformational changes that are induced by Ca2+ binding. In the present studies site-directed spin labeling has been employed in conjunction with conventional continuous-wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw-EPR) to determine how Ca2+ binding to the cardiac CBD12-ACDEF splice variant alters the dynamics of specific regions of the protein. The results from these studies are in qualitative agreement with previous NMR studies on the isolated domains with regard to which regions of the Ca2+ binding domains show the greatest changes upon Ca2+ binding. Pulsed electron-electron double resonance (DEER) has been employed to measure inter-probe distances, and these data have been utilized to construct a family of structural models for CBD12 in the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms. These latter studies show that CBD1 and CBD2 are not arranged in an orientation lengthwise antiparallel and in close proximity as hypothesized in early studies (7Hilge M. Aelen J. Vuister G.W. Ca2+ regulation in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger involves two markedly different Ca2+ sensors.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) but rather are oriented in an almost linear arrangement as suggested by the more recent small angle x-ray scattering studies (12Hilge M. Aelen J. Foarce A. Perrakis A. Vuister G.W. Ca2+ regulation in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger features a dual electrostatic switch mechanism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14333-14338Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and by the NMR studies of Brüschweiler and co-workers (17Salinas R.K. Bruschweiler-Li L. Johnson E. Brüschweiler R. Ca2+ binding alters the interdomain flexibility between the two cytoplasmic calcium binding domains in the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 32123-32131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most significantly, for the NCX1.1 isoform, both DEER measurements and EPR measurements in solution show that the relative orientations of the two Ca2+ binding domains are not significantly altered upon Ca2+ binding. This result strongly suggests that the allosteric signal that regulates the NCX1.1 isoform of the exchanger involves other types of changes in the structure and/or dynamics of CBD12 rather than rigid-body reorientation of the two Ca2+ binding domains relative to each other. Additional studies indicated that binding of Ca2+ does lead to changes in the dynamics of the F-G loops of CBD1 and CBD2. These latter results coupled with previous studies reported in the literature (12Hilge M. Aelen J. Foarce A. Perrakis A. Vuister G.W.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggest that further investigations of this region of the Ca2+ binding domains of CBD12 are warranted. The full-length rat NCX1.1 (ACDEF splice variant) cDNA was generously provided by Dr. J. Lytton at the University of Calgary. For convenience, residue numbers were adopted from canine NCX1.1 ignoring the first N-terminal 32 residues in rat NCX1.1. NdeI (5′) and XhoI (3′) restriction sites were generated at each terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding residues 360–685 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and the resultant PCR fragment was ligated into the pET19b+ expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). All four endogenous cysteines were replaced with alanines to create a cysteine-less (ΔC-CBD12) construct. Single or double cysteine mutants were then produced by introducing cysteines at desired sites on the ΔC-CBD12 construct. The sequences of all the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant DNAs were then transformed into BL21(DE3)PlysS competent cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). One liter of LB broth was inoculated with 10 ml of overnight culture. The culture was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 and transferred to an ice-water bath to cool. Protein overexpression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside and incubating at 27 °C for 4 h. After harvest, the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of lysis buffer that contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm DTT, 16 mm imidazole, 40 units/ml lysozyme, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), pH 8.0, and kept frozen at −80 °C until use. After thawing, the cell suspension was lysed by 2 min of sonication on ice that was followed by incubation with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 units/ml of DNase, and 0.5 units/ml of RNase at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (JA-20 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) for 30 min. The clear lysate was incubated for 1 h with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) that was pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The resin was washed with 100 column volumes of wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 16 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. Single and double mutant proteins were then spin-labeled at 4 °C overnight on the column with a 10-fold molar excess of 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ-3-pyrroline-3-methyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) spin label to generate the R1 side chain shown in Fig. 1 (Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, ON, Canada). Labeled protein bound to the column was washed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl and 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl and 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. Partially purified protein from the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was further purified using a DEAE anion exchange column (TSK DEAE 650M; Ace Scientific, Cherry Hill, NJ) using a linear 0–0.8 m NaCl gradient for elution. The eluted proteins were concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter device (30-kDa nominal molecular mass cutoff, Millipore, Bedford, MA) to the desired protein concentration. The apparent molecular weight and purity of each labeled protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE gel (20Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). All samples used for cw-EPR and DEER studies were greater than 95% pure as determined from the band intensities on the gels. HEK293 cells transfected with either wild-type (WT) or ΔC (the four endogenous cysteines in CBD12 replaced with alanines) NCX1.1 were analyzed by whole-cell patch clamp recording as described in previous studies (21Dong H.

The pipette solution contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 20 mm triethylammonium chloride, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 4.28 mm CaCl2, ([Ca2+]free = 1 μm). The extracellular solutions contained 145 mm LiCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and either 0.5 mm EGTA or 2 mm CaCl2. Solution exchange was achieved by a piezoelectric translator moving a theta glass with EGTA solution flowing continuously through one barrel and Ca2+ solution through the other barrel. Voltage clamp was conducted with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B) at a holding potential of 0 mV. Current traces were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz. For display, traces were filtered at 250 Hz. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were recorded with a voltage ramp protocol over the range −80 to +80 mV (0.5 V/s) at the first time interval during the base-line EGTA solution and at the second time interval during the Ca2+ solution. Outward current was generated when wild-type or ΔC NCX1.1-transfected cells internally dialyzed with a high Na+ were exposed to bath solution containing 2 mm Ca2+. The outward current corresponds to the electrogenic movement of Na+ through the molecule in exchange for Ca2+. The magnitude and time-course of the currents are similar to previous reports (21Dong H.

Control cells transfected with empty vector exhibited currents <1 pA under this protocol (data not shown). The voltage dependence of outward currents was examined under these conditions, which only permit outward Na+/Ca2+ exchange currents. The NCX1.1 I-V plot was calculated by the current in the presence of Ca2+ minus the base-line nonspecific current in EGTA. To assess any global changes in secondary structure due to replacement of WT cysteines with alanines, CD spectra were recorded on wild-type CBD12 and ΔC-CBD12. Spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 system (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) at room temperature in a 0.1-cm path length cell. All spectra were obtained from samples in buffer containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The data were collected from 190 to 260 nm at a scanning speed of 50 nm/min. The raw data, in millidegrees (θ), were converted to molar ellipticity ([θ]) using the relationship: [θ]=100θ/(ncl)(Eq. 1) where n is the number of amino acid residues, c is the protein concentration in mm, and l is the path length in cm. cw-EPR spectra were collected at X-band (9.8 GHz) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with a TM110 cavity (BrukerBiospin, Billerica, MA) using 5-milliwatt microwave power and 1-gauss field modulation at 100 kHz. Samples were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, in the 80–120 μm concentration range, and spectra were collected at room temperature in 50-μl glass capillaries (Kimble Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ). Short inter-probe distances (<20 Å) were measured on samples in 50% glycerol at 2 °C. The resultant EPR spectra were analyzed using a convolution method that assumed a Gaussian distance distribution as described in previous work (e.g. Refs. 23Hustedt E.J. Stein R.A. Sethaphong L.

Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free samples were prepared by treating proteins with 10 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA, respectively, before EPR measurements. The four-pulse DEER experiment was performed at X-band (9.5 GHz) on a Bruker EleXsys 580 spectrometer equipped with a Bruker split ring resonator (ER 4118X-MD5). A standard 4-pulse sequence was employed with a 32-ns π pulse and a 16-ns π/2 pulse. All measurements were recorded at 80 K as described in previous work (25Kim S. Brandon S. Zhou Z. Cobb C.E.

Samples were prepared in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 30% (w/w) glycerol in the 150–250 μm spin concentration range and loaded into 2.4 mm inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad LabGlass, Buena, NJ). All DEER data were analyzed using software developed in-house that simultaneously fits the background signal as a function of an effective spin concentration and radius of the molecule or complex while determining the specific interactions of interest using a distance distribution defined as a sum of gaussians (28Brandon S.

https://openalex.org/W2009881619,"We assessed the impact of home-based care (HBC) for HIV+ patients, comparing outcomes between two groups of Zambians receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) who lived in villages with and without HBC teams.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using medical charts from Macha Mission Hospital, a hospital providing HIV care in Zambia's rural Southern Province. Date of birth, date of ART initiation, place of residence, sex, body mass index (BMI), CD4+ cell count, and hemoglobin (Hgb) were abstracted. Logistic regression was used to test our hypothesis that HBC was associated with treatment outcomes.Of 655 patients, 523 (80%) were eligible and included in the study. There were 428 patients (82%) with favorable outcomes (alive and on ART) and 95 patients (18%) with unfavorable outcomes (died, lost to follow-up, or stopped treatment). A minority of the 523 eligible patients (n = 84, 16%) lived in villages with HBC available. Living in a village with HBC was not significantly associated with treatment outcomes; 80% of patients in a village with HBC had favorable outcomes, compared to 82% of patients in a village without HBC (P = 0.6 by χ(2)). In bivariable analysis, lower BMI (P<0.001), low CD4+ cell count (P = 0.02), low Hgb concentration (P = 0.02), and older age at ART initiation (P = 0.047) were associated with unfavorable outcomes. In multivariable analysis, low BMI remained associated with unfavorable outcomes (P<0.001).We did not find that living in a village with HBC available was associated with improved treatment outcomes. We speculate that the ART clinic's rigorous treatment preparation before ART initiation and continuous adherence counseling during ART create a motivated group of patients whose outcomes did not improve with additional HBC support. An alternative explanation is that the quality of the HBC program is suboptimal."
https://openalex.org/W2021211390,"Studies of glycerol metabolism in the heart have largely emphasized its role in triglyceride synthesis. However, glycerol may also be oxidized in the citric acid cycle, and glycogen synthesis from glycerol has been reported in the nonmammalian myocardium. The intent of this study was to test the hypothesis that glycerol may be metabolized to glycogen in mammalian heart. Isolated rat hearts were supplied with a mixture of substrates including glucose, lactate, pyruvate, octanoate, [U-(13)C(3)]glycerol, and (2)H(2)O to probe various metabolic pathways including glycerol oxidation, glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and carbon sources of stored glycogen. NMR analysis confirmed that glycogen production from the level of the citric acid cycle did not occur and that the glycerol contribution to oxidation in the citric acid cycle was negligible in the presence of alternative substrates. Quite unexpectedly, (13)C from [U-(13)C(3)]glycerol appeared in glycogen in carbon positions 4-6 of glucosyl units but none in positions 1-3. The extent of [4,5,6-(13)C(3)]glucosyl unit enrichment in glycogen was enhanced by insulin but decreased by H(2)O(2). Given that triose phosphate isomerase is generally assumed to fully equilibrate carbon tracers in the triose pool, the marked (13)C asymmetry in glycogen can only be attributed to conversion of [U-(13)C(3)]glycerol to [U-(13)C(3)]dihydroxyacetone phosphate and [U-(13)C(3)]glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate followed by rearrangements in the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway involving transaldolase that places this (13)C-enriched 3-carbon unit only in the bottom half of hexose phosphate molecules contributing to glycogen."
https://openalex.org/W2121600133,"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on a disease are increasingly available from multiple related populations. In this scenario, meta-analyses can improve power to detect homogeneous genetic associations, but if there exist ancestry-specific effects, via interactions on genetic background or with a causal effect that co-varies with genetic background, then these will typically be obscured. To address this issue, we have developed a robust statistical method for detecting susceptibility gene-ancestry interactions in multi-cohort GWAS based on closely-related populations. We use the leading principal components of the empirical genotype matrix to cluster individuals into “ancestry groups” and then look for evidence of heterogeneous genetic associations with disease or other trait across these clusters. Robustness is improved when there are multiple cohorts, as the signal from true gene-ancestry interactions can then be distinguished from gene-collection artefacts by comparing the observed interaction effect sizes in collection groups relative to ancestry groups. When applied to colorectal cancer, we identified a missense polymorphism in iron-absorption gene CYBRD1 that associated with disease in individuals of English, but not Scottish, ancestry. The association replicated in two additional, independently-collected data sets. Our method can be used to detect associations between genetic variants and disease that have been obscured by population genetic heterogeneity. It can be readily extended to the identification of genetic interactions on other covariates such as measured environmental exposures. We envisage our methodology being of particular interest to researchers with existing GWAS data, as ancestry groups can be easily defined and thus tested for interactions."
