In an experimental condition, group members made individual attitude judgments, discussed them, and remade judgments. Control groups discussed irrelevant materials before responding again to the attitude items. As predicted, discussion of the racial attitude items with others having similar attitudes significantly increased the gap between high- and low-prejudice groups."

https://openalex.org/W2079990645,"Two patients with Fabry's disease were infused with normal plasma to provide active enzyme (ceramide trihexosidase) for hydrolysis of the plasma substrate, galactosylgalactosylglucosylceramide. Maximum ceramide trihexosidase activity occurred 6 hours after infusion of the plasma, attaining a level approximately 150 percent of that in normal plasma; enzymatic activity was detectable for 7 days. The amount of accumulated substrate in the plasma of these recipients decreased about 50 percent on day 10 after infusion. Thus, periodic replacement of ceramide trihexosidase activity in the plasma of patients with Fabry's disease might lead to consistently lower amounts of substrate in the plasma and a decrease in its rate of accumulation in tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1991371734,"Two azaguanine-resistant clones of cultured, human fibroblasts were isolated from unrelated strains of karyotypically normal, male cells. The most resistant mutant has little hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, is virtually unable to incorporate hypoxanthine (a normal substrate of the enzyme), and resembles fibroblasts cultured from boys with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The less resistant mutant has about one-third as much enzyme activity as its parent strain and is less able to utilize hypoxanthine. Both mutants are morphologically and karyotypically normal. These mutations may have occurred at the X-chromosomal, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus and may provide a realistic experimental model for studying mutation in human genetic material."

https://openalex.org/W1538266938,"Abstract The enzyme that catalyzes the removal of a two-carbon compound from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(d-erythro-1',2',3'-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropteridine (known by the trivial name of dihydroneopterin) to yield 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine, has been purified by approximately 1100-fold from extracts of Escherichia coli B. The two-carbon compound formed as a product has been identified as glycolaldehyde. Since the reaction is similar to those reactions catalyzed by aldolases, the enzyme has been named dihydroneopterin aldolase. The enzyme is relatively heat-stable in that it can withstand a temperature of 100° for 5 min with virtually no loss of activity. The enzyme functions optimally at pH 9.6. The addition of chelating agents such as EDTA markedly increases the activity of the enzyme. The Km for dihydroneopterin is approximately 9 µm. The enzyme cannot use the following compounds as substrates in place of dihydroneopterin: neopterin, tetrahydroneopterin, dihydroneopterin monophosphate, and dihydroneopterin triphosphate. The product of the reaction, 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine, is a potent inhibitor of the reaction. Other dihydropteridines, including dihydropteroic acid and dihydrofolic acid, are less potent inhibitors. It was found that purified dihydroneopterin aldolase could use as substrate an epimer of dihydroneopterin, i.e. 2-amino-4-hydroxy-(6-l-threo-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropteridine, but the corresponding d-threo and l-erythro compounds could not be utilized, although the l-erythro compound could be utilized for the synthesis of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine in the presence of purified dihydroneopterin aldolase and another enzyme fraction obtained from extracts of E. coli. This suggests that E. coli contains an enzyme that catalyzes the epimerization of the l-erythro compound to a compound that can be used directly as substrate by the purified aldolase (presumably the corresponding l-threo compound)."
https://openalex.org/W1583163060,"Abstract Colicins Ia and Ib have been purified from mitomycin C-induced Escherichia coli strains W 3110 str-r (col Ia) and W3110 str-r (col Ib) by ammonium sulfate precipitation, treatment with diethylaminoethylcellulose, and chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, phosphocellulose, and hydroxylapatite. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium centrifugation as well as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at several pH values indicated that both colicin preparations were homogeneous. The molecular weight of colicin Ia was determined from its s20,w0 (3.57 S) and D20,w0 (4.12 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1) as well as from sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation and dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be approximately 77,600. The molecular weight of colicin Ib was approximately 79,600 (s20,w0 = 3.67 S; D20,w0 = 4.32 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1). Colicins Ia and Ib had f/f0 values of 1.82 and 1.76, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2049461814,Replicating circular molecules of colicin factor E1 have been isolated from minicells produced by a colicinogenic derivative of Escherichia coli P678-54. The replicating structures observed in electron micrographs are circular molecules with two branched points. Several structures found among the replicating molecules are interpretable as replicating rolling circles.
https://openalex.org/W1501590999,"Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase from Escherichia coli does not exhibit a steady state kinetic pattern indicative of kinetics, despite the fact that catalytic participation of a phosphorylated enzyme covalent intermediate has been established. Instead, kinetic patterns are consistent with the sequential addition of all substrates, to form a quaternary complex, before the release of any product. Double reciprocal plots are intersecting with ATP and succinate varied at nonsaturating concentration of the third substrate, CoA. These plots become parallel at higher CoA concentrations, suggesting that CoA can be the second substrate to add in the binding sequence. Analogous reciprocal plots with ATP and CoA varied at both nonsaturating and saturating succinate concentrations are also intersecting and parallel, respectively. The data may be reconciled with a binding sequence in which ATP binds to the enzyme first, followed by the random addition of CoA and succinate. The finding of a sequential mechanism for the addition of substrates to this enzyme, whose catalysis is known to involve a covalent intermediate, serves to illustrate a possible danger in the use of initial rate kinetics. It is not possible to discount chemical mechanisms involving covalent intermediates by failure to observe the ping-pong kinetic pattern which may be anticipated for these catalytic routes."

https://openalex.org/W1534005555,"Abstract Anthranilate synthetase Component I, one component of the anthranilate synthetase-anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase aggregate which catalyzes the first two reactions of tryptophan synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium, has been purified to homogeneity. Anthranilate synthetase Component I is a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 64,000 ± 3,500 and contains a single binding site for the feedback inhibitor, tryptophan. Tryptophan causes a decreased rate of reaction of enzyme sulfhydryl groups with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) suggesting that inhibition of this monomeric regulatory protein by feedback inhibitor is by a conformational alteration. Glycerol activates anthranilate synthetase Component I but is less efficient than the second protein component, anthranilate-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase."
https://openalex.org/W1980833143,"WE have previously shown1 that antibodies prepared against smooth muscle actomyosin and capable of reacting with fibroblasts of connective tissue and with thrombocytes (platelets) markedly reduced the aggregative competence of embryonic chick muscle and liver cells. These antibodies were type specific and did not react with skeletal or cardiac striated muscle actomyosin nor with the (Na+,K+,Mg2+)-ATPase from human erythrocyte ghosts2. The same antibodies blocked the activity of the Ca2+-dependent myosin ATPase of smooth muscle actomyosin3. Antibodies directed against striated muscle actomyosin and capable of blocking the activity of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase of this protein did not produce the aggregation-inhibitory effect. This led to the suggestion that the effect was the result of the antibodies against smooth muscle actomyosin reacting with an actomyosin of similar type at the surface of the muscle and liver cells1."

https://openalex.org/W2068783705,In cultured fibroblasts from individuals with cystinosis vacuolation is induced by exposure to L-cysteine-D-penicillamine disulfide. Normal fibroblasts do not show vacuolation on such exposure. These observations provide direct evidence that cystinotic cells have deficient activity of a lysosomal system for disulfide metabolism or transport. Induction of vacuolation by the mixed disulfide in cystinotic but not in normal cells furnishes a histological marker for cystinotic fibroblasts.
