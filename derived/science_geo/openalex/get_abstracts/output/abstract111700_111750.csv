https://openalex.org/W1959677146,"We have used organ culture of fetal thymic lobes from T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic beta 2M(-/-) mice to study the role of peptides in positive selection. The TCR used was from a CD8+ T cell specific for ovalbumin 257-264 in the context of Kb. Several peptides with the ability to induce positive selection were identified. These peptide-selected thymocytes have the same phenotype as mature CD8+ T cells and can respond to antigen. Those peptides with the ability to induce positive selection were all variants of the antigenic peptide and were identified as TCR antagonist peptides for this receptor. One peptide tested, E1, induced positive selection on the beta 2M(-/-) background but negative selection on the beta 2M(+/-) background. These results show that the process of positive selection is exquisitely peptide specific and sensitive to extremely low ligand density and support the notion that low efficacy ligands mediate positive selection."
https://openalex.org/W2075000963,"Isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH) is one of the most widely used antituberculosis drugs, yet its precise target of action on Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unknown. A missense mutation within the mycobacterial inhA gene was shown to confer resistance to both INH and ethionamide (ETH) in M. smegmatis and in M. bovis. The wild-type inhA gene also conferred INH and ETH resistance when transferred on a multicopy plasmid vector to M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG. The InhA protein shows significant sequence conservation with the Escherichia coli enzyme EnvM, and cell-free assays indicate that it may be involved in mycolic acid biosynthesis. These results suggest that InhA is likely a primary target of action for INH and ETH."
https://openalex.org/W2049425193,"The segment polarity genes hedgehog and engrailed are expressed in identical posterior-compartment-specific patterns in both Drosophila embryos and imaginal discs. We show here that the hedgehog protein is secreted, and it can cross embryo parasegment borders and the anterior-posterior compartment border of imaginal discs to neighboring cells that express neither engrailed nor hedgehog. In these cells, it is localized in discrete punctate structures that are sequestered within the polarized epithelium. Analysis of animals that have expressed hedgehog ectopically, or of a mutant that expresses hedgehog abnormally in the anterior compartment of the wing disc, indicates that hedgehog is involved in regulating patched. In the embryo, hedgehog regulation of patched apparently facilitates patched and wingless expression. In the discs, hedgehog regulation of patched and other genes in the anterior compartment helps to establish the proximodistal axis. We propose that the cell-cell communication mediated by hedgehog links the special properties of compartment borders with specification of the proximodistal axis in imaginal development."
https://openalex.org/W2071287590,"Despite intensive efforts, the general rules for γδ T cell recognition remain undefined. Here, we take advantage of the detailed knowledge of the molecular structure and biosynthetic pathways of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to analyze the recognition properties of the γδ T cell clones LBK5 (specific for the class II MHC, IEk) and G8 (specific for the nonclassical class I MHC, TL 10b). We find that the activation of these clones requires neither class I nor class II antigen-processing and that peptides do not confer specificity. Epitope mapping also shows that the topology of γδ T cell receptor interaction with the MHC is distinct from that of αβ T cells. These results suggest that the molecular nature of γδ T cell recognition is fundamentally different than that of αβ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2069396761,"We have Investigated DNA interactions between homologs and between sister chromatids during meiosis in S. cerevisiae. We have detected a DNA species containing information from both parental chromosomes at a specific hotspot for meiotic recombination and double strand breaks (DSBs). These joint molecules are a prominent feature of meiotic prophase. They appear to be a major intermediate stage in DSB-promoted recombination, because they occur with appropriate timing and require known recombination functions. Other possibilities cannot be completely dismissed, however. Most or all joint molecules contain two full-length nonrecombinant strands from each parental duplex and thus do not consist of single Holliday junctions. Joint molecules form between sister chromatids at ∼ 10% the interhomolog level. Also, joint molecule formation is aberrant in a mutant defective in the HOP1 gene, which encodes a meiotic chromosome structure component. General models for discrimination between homologs and sisters during meiosis are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2004099247,"A screen to detect yeast mutants that frequently lost expression of subtelomeric genes identified two mutations in PIF1, a gene known to encode a 5' to 3' DNA helicase. The loss of expression of subtelomeric genes in pif1 cells was due to deletion of the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes and the generation of new telomeres at proximal sites. In pif1 mutants, de novo telomere formation usually occurred at sites with very little homology to telomeric DNA. De novo telomere formation after HO-induced chromosome breakage also occurred at elevated frequencies in pif1 cells. Moreover, mutations in PIF1 caused all telomeres to lengthen. These results suggest that the PIF1 helicase is an inhibitor of both de novo telomere formation and telomere elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1970306306,"Prion diseases of humans and animals are known to be caused by infection with prions containing PrPSc or mutation of the prion protein (PrP) gene. During transgenetic studies, we discovered that uninoculated older mice harboring high copy numbers of wild-type (wt) PrP transgenes derived from Syrian hamsters (SHa), sheep (She), and PrP-B mice developed truncal ataxia, hindlimb paralysis, and tremors. These transgenic (Tg) mice exhibited a profound necrotizing myopathy involving skeletal muscle, a demyelinating polyneuropathy, and focal vacuolation of the central nervous system. Development of disease was dependent on transgene dosage. For example, half of all Tg(SHaPrP+/+)7 mice homozygous for the SHaPrP transgene array developed disease by approximately 460 days of age, while no hemizygous Tg(SHaPrP+/o)7 mice became ill before 650 days. The novel neurologic syndrome found in older Tg(wtPrP) mice implies that overexpression of wtPrPC is pathogenic and widens the spectrum of prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2026111974,"Chromatin structure at Schizosaccharomyces pombe centromeres is unusual. The insertion of the ura4 gene within these centromeres resulted in genetically identical cells mosaic for its expression. Placement of the ade6 gene within cen1 or cen3 resulted in red-white sectored colonies, demonstrating the instability of gene expression. The occurrence of pink colonies implied that intermediate levels of repression were established. Repression of both genes within centromeres was temperature sensitive. The chromatin structure of the ura4 gene at centromeres was altered, suggesting that the unusual chromatin encroaches into the gene and inhibits normal expression. These repressive effects at S. pombe centromeres resemble the classical phenomenon of position effect variegation imposed by Drosophila heterochromatin on nearby genes. However, since the epigenetic states can be set at intermediate levels of expression, a purely euchromatin-heterochromatin dichotomy does not apply. A model for the epigenetic regulation of genes placed within S. pombe centromeres is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1999529317,"The development of most epidermal sensory organs in Drosophila is controlled by achaete and scute, two of the genes of the achaete-scute complex (AS-C). The genes of the AS-C encode members of the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class of transcriptional regulators, and their activity defines proneural cell clusters in the imaginal discs from which sensory organ mother cells are singled out by a process of lateral inhibition. Ectopic expression of lethal of scute, another member of the AS-C, normally dispensable for sensory organ development in the adult, promotes this process independently of the activity of the other AS-C genes. This demonstrates a high degree of functional redundancy of the products of the AS-C. Furthermore, neurogenic genes are activated in ectopic proneural clusters, allowing development of epidermal progenitor cells. Finally, the bHLH domain is necessary and sufficient to mediate the proneural function, to activate neurogenic genes, and to allow lateral inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1964787551,"The transcription factor gene HNF-3 beta is expressed in the ventral midline of the mouse embryonic neural tube, including the floor plate, a structure important for dorsoventral patterning and axonal guidance. To assess HNF-3 beta function, the gene has been ectopically expressed in the midbrain/hindbrain of transgenic embryos using an En-2 promoter/enhancer. By 18.5 days postcoitum, transgenic brains show a range of abnormalities, including absent inferior colliculus and reduced cerebellum. Earlier, several genes normally expressed in the floor plate (BMP-1, Steel factor, and HNF-3 alpha) are induced within the same ectopic dorsal domain as HNF-3 beta, and autoactivation of the endogenous HNF-3 beta is observed. Conversely, expression of the dorsal gene Pax-3 is suppressed. Ectopic dorsal neuronal differentiation and abnormal dorsal axonal projections are also seen. These results suggest that HNF-3 beta is an important regulator of floor plate development in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2116008573,"The 40 kb Balbiani ring 1 (BR1) gene is at a given moment transcribed by, on average, 120 RNA polymerases. Here we directly assay the excision of introns both in the nascent and in the released nucleoplasmic BR1 pre-mRNAs, isolated by microdissection. We show that intron 3, located 3 kb from the 5' end of the pre-mRNA, is excised simultaneous with transcription. Within 2.5 min of transcription time, 50% of the pre-mRNA molecules have lost the intron. Intron 4, located 600 bases from the polyadenylation site, is excised cotranscriptionally in 5%-10% of the molecules and after or during release to the nucleoplasm in the remaining molecules. Our results demonstrate that spliceosome assembly is a cotranscriptional process in vivo and that splicing may occur during transcription but also after completed transcription, depending on the position of the intron."
https://openalex.org/W2089176336,"The structure of the DNA binding domain, determined at 1.8 angstrom resolution, contains a three-helix bundle that is capped by a four-stranded antiparallel beta sheet. This structure is a variant of the helix-turn-helix motif, typified by catabolite activator protein. In the heat shock transcription factor, the first helix of the motif (alpha 2) has an alpha-helical bulge and a proline-induced kink. The angle between the two helices of the motif (alpha 2 and alpha 3) is about 20 degrees smaller than the average for canonical helix-turn-helix proteins. Nevertheless, the relative positions of the first and third helices of the bundle (alpha 1 and alpha 3) are conserved. It is proposed here that the first helix of the three-helix bundle be considered a component of the helix-turn-helix motif."
https://openalex.org/W1994947913,"Quality control mechanisms prevent the cell surface expression of incompletely assembled multisubunit receptors such as the T cell receptor (TCR). The molecular chaperone function of calnexin (IP90, p88), a 90-kilodalton protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in the retention of representative chains of the TCR-CD3 complex in the ER was tested. Truncation mutants of calnexin, when transiently expressed in COS cells, were exported from the ER and either accumulated in the Golgi or progressed to the cell surface. CD3 epsilon chains cotransfected with the forms of calnexin that were not retained in the ER exited the ER and colocalized with calnexin. Since engineered calnexin determined the intracellular localization of the proteins associated with it, it is concluded that calnexin interacts with incompletely assembled TCR components and retains them in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1547329911,"Insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is controlled by peptides as well as by nutrients. We report here a novel, extraordinarily potent peptidergic regulation of insulin secretion. A 27-residue form of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP27) as low as 10(-14) to 10(-13) M stimulated insulin release from rat islets in a glucose-dependent manner. PACAP27 also increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in islet beta-cells. Nitrendipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, abolished both [Ca2+]i and insulin responses. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a peptide exhibiting 68% amino acid homology with PACAP, also increased [Ca2+]i in beta-cells but only at concentrations in the nanomolar range, indicating that PACAP27 is 4 logs more potent. A 38-residue form of the peptide (PACAP38) stimulated insulin release and increased beta-cell [Ca2+]i in a manner similar to that of PACAP27. PACAP-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in pancreatic nerve fibers, islets, and capillaries. The results indicate that PACAP is a physiologically occurring peptide in pancreas and that PACAP, in a glucose-dependent manner, activates beta-cells presumably via a high affinity PACAP-selective receptor, raises [Ca2+]i by increasing the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels, and consequently stimulates insulin release. PACAP appears to be by far the most potent insulinotropic peptide known."
https://openalex.org/W1502590013,"Osteocalcin is the most abundant noncollagenous protein of bone. Here we report that the mouse genome contains an osteocalcin cluster composed of three genes arranged within a 23-kilobase span of genomic DNA. We named them osteocalcin gene 1 (OG1), osteocalcin gene 2 (OG2), and osteocalcin-related gene (ORG) in order from the 5' end to the 3' end of the cluster. Hybridization of polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNAs with specific oligonucleotides and RNase protection assays showed that OG1 and OG2 are expressed only in bone, whereas ORG is transcribed in kidney but not in bone. Furthermore, during embryogenesis, OG1 and OG2 begin to be expressed at day 15.5, while ORG is transcribed as early as day 10.5. The protein encoded by ORG has a similar pattern of expression and identical structural features to nephrocalcin, a calcium-binding protein partially purified from kidney that plays a role in calcium reabsorption and in prevention of nephrolithiasis. The nephrocalcin gene has not been cloned in any species; we propose that ORG is the mouse nephrocalcin gene. The existence of several osteocalcin or osteocalcin-related sequences is not restricted to mouse but is present in every species we examined."
https://openalex.org/W1596104133,"The thrombin receptor, a member of the seven membrane-spanning superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors, is activated by an irreversible proteolytic mechanism, but signaling by activated thrombin receptors shuts off soon after receptor activation. This shut-off mechanism is thought to be required for concentration-dependent responses to thrombin and an important determinant of the cell's sensitivity to thrombin. We report that the thrombin receptor is rapidly phosphorylated upon activation, consistent with the action of a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase. Moreover, the G-protein coupled receptor kinase BARK2 (beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 2) blocked signaling by thrombin receptors coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes. In this system, rhodopsin kinase was inactive and BARK1 was markedly less effective than BARK2. Thrombin receptor mutants which lacked potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in the receptor's cytoplasmic tail were insensitive to inhibition by exogenous BARK2 but did confer concentration-dependent responses to thrombin. Our studies demonstrate that a G-protein coupled receptor kinase can shut off thrombin receptor signaling but that additional mechanism(s) for terminating signaling exist. These studies also reveal functional specificity among G-protein coupled receptor kinases in a novel in vivo reconstitution system and show that heterologous expression of these kinases can be used to manipulate cellular responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1601455272,"We have previously found that Raf-1, which is activated by hematopoietic growth factors in association with phosphorylation, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation. Recently, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate has been found to mediate phosphorylation, suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) may be involved in the activation mechanism(s). Since PKC can be activated by hematopoietic growth factors, it was investigated as a potential Raf-1 kinase-kinase. Results demonstrate that bryostatin 1, a pharmacologic activator of PKC, induces activation of in FDC-P1 cells. PKC inhibitors H7 and staurosporine block both bryostatin 1- and interleukin-3-mediated phosphorylation and FDC-P1 cell proliferation. Additionally, an antisense c-raf oligodeoxyribonucleotide specifically inhibits bryostatin 1-mediated proliferation, indicating a necessary role for in PKC signaling. Purified PKC can phosphorylate serine residues to high stoichiometry in vitro. Comparative phosphopeptide maps localize two PKC phosphorylation sites to phosphopeptides isolated from hematopoietic growth factor- or bryostatin 1-stimulated cells. The sites of PKC-mediated phosphorylation are deduced to be Ser497 and Ser619. Furthermore, PKC-mediated serine phosphorylation is sufficient to activate the enzymatic function of in vitro. These findings demonstrate that activated PKC can promote hematopoietic cell growth by regulating the enzymatic activity of through direct serine phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2077863888,"Comparative studies suggest that sex chromosomes begin as ordinary autosomes that happen to carry a major sex determining locus. Over evolutionary time the Y chromosome is selected to stop recombining with the X chromosome, perhaps in response to accumulation of alleles beneficial to the heterogametic but harmful to the homogametic sex. Population genetic theory predicts that a nonrecombining Y chromosome should degenerate. Here this prediction is tested by application of specific selection pressures to Drosophila melanogaster populations. Results demonstrate the decay of a nonrecombining, nascent Y chromosome and the capacity for recombination to ameliorate such decay."

A spatial resolution of 50 nanometers was obtained while imaging a lithographically prepared gold pattern with x-rays in the energy range of 5 to 8 kiloelectron volts. This is the highest resolution scanning x-ray image made to date with hard x-rays. With a beam 360 nanometers in diameter, Laue diffraction was observed from the smallest sample volume ever probed by x-ray diffraction, 5 × 10-3 cubic micrometers."
https://openalex.org/W2045868645,"The vagus nerve exerts a profound influence on the heart, regulating the heart rate and rhythm. An extensive vagal innervation of the cardiac ventricles and the central origin and extent of this innervation was demonstrated by transynaptic transport of pseudorabies virus with a virulent and two attenuated pseudorabies viral strains. The neurons that innervate the ventricles are numerous, and their distribution within the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus is similar to that of neurons innervating other cardiac targets, such as the sino-atrial node. These data provide a neuroanatomical correlate to the physiological influence of the vagus nerve on ventricular function."
https://openalex.org/W1551687657,"Mouse genomic fragments encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were isolated from a recombinant lambda library by in situ plaque hybridization. The mouse HO-1 gene, approximately 7 kilobase pairs (kbp) in length, is organized into 5 exons and 4 introns. The primary structure of the exons and 1287 base pairs (bp) of the 5'-flanking region was determined. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse HO-1 gene is identical to that of p32, initially identified as a stress-induced protein in mouse BALBc/3T3 cells. A single, major transcription initiation site is utilized for constitutive and heme- or metal-induced expression of the HO-1 gene in mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells. The transcriptional activity of the 5'-flanking region was examined by transient expression assays using the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as the reporter gene. Basal promoter activity in several cell lines was localized to within 149 bp of the upstream sequence by deletion analysis. This proximal promoter region of the mouse HO-1 gene contains several sequence elements that are not only conserved in both the rat and human HO-1 genes but also resemble consensus binding sites of various transcription factors including AP-1, AP-4, C/EBP and c-Myc:Max/USF. Heavy metals activate HO-1 gene transcription and the rat gene contains a putative metal regulatory element (Muller, R. M., Taguchi, H., and Shibahara, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 6795-6802) that is completely conserved in the mouse gene. Transient expression analyses, however, indicate that this sequence, which contains a core heptanucleotide, TGCACTC, identical to that of the strongest metal regulatory element of the mouse metallothionein-1 gene, is not responsive to Cd2+ or Zn2+. Stable transfection of constructs containing the entire mouse HO-1 gene and various portions of the 5'-flanking region into rat C6 glioma cells and simultaneous, quantitative analysis of the mouse and rat HO-1 mRNAs indicate that distal 5' sequences, between positions -3.5 and -12.5 kbp, are required for induction of mouse HO-1 gene transcription by both heme and heavy metals. A 5-7-fold difference in the levels of induction between stably integrated and transiently expressed mouse HO-1 gene constructs is observed in this cell line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2035550196,"Virtually all organisms manifest circadian (24-hour) rhythms, governed by an ill-defined endogenous pacemaker or clock. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Drosophila melanogaster period gene product PER is a clock component. If PER were central to the time-keeping mechanism, a transient increase in its concentration would cause a stable shift in the phase of the clock. Therefore, transgenic flies bearing a heat-inducible copy of PER were subjected to temperature pulses. This treatment caused long-lasting phase shifts in the locomotor activity circadian rhythm, a result that supports the contention that PER is a bona fide clock component."
https://openalex.org/W1486803151,"The purple phosphatases catalyze hydrolysis of phosphate esters (optimum pH approximately 5) and are resistant to inhibition by dextro-rotatory tartrate; their distinctive color is due to Fe(III)-phenolate charge-transfer transitions at their active site. Expression of human purple phosphatase, designated type 5 acid phosphatase, is restricted to osteoclasts and other activated cells of monohistiocytic lineage, but its biological role in relation to bone resorption and phagocytosis is unknown. To characterize this enzyme further, we have engineered the human type 5 acid phosphatase into a baculovirus vector expression system that enabled milligram quantities of purple protein to be purified from medium containing Sf9 host cells. The phosphatase cDNA was transcribed as a single RNA species of 1.5 kilobases as in human tissues. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity reacting with uteroferrin antisera appeared in the culture medium, from which up to 8 mg/liter was purified by two-step cation-exchange chromatography at pH 8.0. Two isoforms of approximately 36 kDa were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and were converted to a single species of apparent molecular size 34 kDa upon treatment with N-glycosidase F, indicating secreted glycoforms of a single polypeptide. Mass spectroscopy showed that the mean molecular mass of the active, secreted glycoprotein was 35849 Da. The recombinant enzyme (specific activity, 190 mumol p-nitrophenol/min/mg at 37 degrees C) contained 2 iron atoms/molecule and formed purple, monoclinic crystals. Exposure to the ferric chelator, 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one, rapidly inactivated the enzyme, which was not inhibited by alpha, alpha'-bipyridyl, a ferrous chelator. That ferric iron is essential for enzymatic catalysis, was further indicated by the synergistic effects of the reductant, dithiothreitol, and bipyridyl on phosphatase activity. The recombinant purple phosphatase catalyzed the peroxidation of 5-aminophthalhydrazide (luminol), as evidenced by the induction of chemiluminescence; this reaction was inhibited by alpha, alpha'-bipyridyl at concentrations that did not inhibit phosphatase activity. The divalent iron moiety of human type 5 phosphatase may therefore participate in the generation of free radical species by fluid-phase reactions involving Fenton chemistry that are dissociated from its phosphatase function."
https://openalex.org/W1566131689,"The catalytic activity of the calf thymus 5'- to 3'-exonuclease was measured on substrates consisting of two primers annealed adjacent to each other on a template. Exonucleolytic degradation of the downstream primer is very slow if the primers are separated by a gap of one nucleotide or if no upstream primer is present. When only a nick separates the primers, degradation is rapid. This suggests that the nuclease is designed to work with calf DNA polymerases such that synthesis from an upstream primer creates the favored nuclease substrate. Nuclease action then destroys the substrate, but it is regenerated by further polymerization. This process, termed nick translation, is necessary for both DNA replication and repair. If the downstream primer has an unannealed 5'-region, that region is removed by an endonuclease activity residing in the same enzyme. Efficient endonuclease action also requires an upstream primer that is annealed such that its 3'-end is directly adjacent to the annealed region of the downstream primer. This reaction is likely to be important for removal of DNA segments that are damaged such that exonuclease cleavage of the damaged site is not possible."
https://openalex.org/W1600977202,"The requirement of NIFB activity for the biosynthesis of iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co) can be satisfied by the addition of the low molecular weight product of NIFB, termed NifB cofactor (NifB-co). NifB-co has been purified to homogeneity by a unique one-step method. Addition of NifB-co into the FeMo-co synthesis system generated nitrogenase activity of 27-32 nmol of ethylene formed/min/nmol of iron. Iron is the only metal detected in the NifB-co. NifB-co-dependent in vitro FeMo-co synthesis is absolutely dependent on the presence of molybdate, homocitrate and active NIFNE protein in the reaction mixture. The cofactor appears to be a small Fe-S cluster synthesized by NIFB, as a precursor of FeMo-co. NifB-co did not display any EPR signal at 4 K in 0-4000 gauss range. A solution of NifB-co is greenish-brown in color, similar to FeMo-co. NifB-co exhibits a broad absorbance between 400 and 700 nm with no distinctive peaks or shoulders. NifB-co is stable to repeated freeze-thaw cycles and is also stable in N-methylformamide, the solvent used for the isolation of FeMo-co. The NifB-co is stable to a 5-min heat treatment at 60 degrees C. The cofactor is extremely O2-labile, with half-life of less then 15 s in air."
https://openalex.org/W2152700834,"To investigate the function of antioxidant enzymes in intact cells, we examined the removal of extracellular H2O2 by cultured fibroblasts (IMR-90). H2O2 concentration dependence of the reaction rate was interpreted as that the process involves two kinetically different reactions (referred to as reactions 1 and 2). Reaction 1 was characterized by a relatively low Km value (about 40 microM), and reaction 2 by linear dependence of the rate up to 500 microM H2O2. The magnitude of reaction 1 was reduced by treatment of the cells with diethyl maleate or 6-amino-nicotinamide, while reaction 2 was inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole treatment. It was concluded that reactions 1 and 2 are principally due to GSH peroxidase and catalase, respectively. The values of kinetic parameters were estimated by curve-fitting, and it was inferred that 80 to 90% of H2O2 is decomposed by GSH peroxidase at H2O2 concentrations lower than 10 microM. The contribution of catalase increases with the increase in H2O2 concentration. The intact cells showed a low catalase activity (about 15%), as compared with the activity found in the solubilized cells. The low catalase activity was ascribed to the latency of the enzyme caused by localization in peroxisomes. Fibroblasts also removed intracellular H2O2 generated by menadione. Treatment with diethyl maleate greatly impaired the H2O2-removing capability and caused H2O2 efflux into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1481997520,"Heme oxygenase, a central monooxygenase enzyme of the heme catabolism and the associated generation of carbon monoxide, forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with iron protoporphyrin IX, which is a prosthetic active center and at the same time the substrate of the enzyme. By using EPR, resonance Raman, and optical absorption spectroscopic techniques, we have determined the axial ligand coordination of the enzyme-heme complex. The ferric heme iron in the heme-enzyme complex at neutral pH is six-coordinate high spin, while at alkaline pH (pKa 7.6), the complex becomes low spin. Spectra of ferrous forms of the complex indicate that histidine serves as the iron proximal axial ligand and that the residue is in its neutral imidazole rather than its imidazolate protonation state. Thus, the active site of the heme-heme oxygenase complex has a myoglobin-like structure rather than an active site similar to the large cytochrome P-450 class of monooxygenases. As a consequence, the activated form of the heme-heme oxygenase complex, a peroxo intermediate, is different from that of the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases, in which the activated form is an oxo intermediate. The overall catalytic mechanism is probably more closely related to that of other monooxygenases with myoglobin-like active sites, such as secondary amine monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1976015057,"All recombination models postulate one or more recombination intermediates that are joint molecules containing two homologous parental molecules. A spike of branched DNA molecules not seen in DNA from mitotic cells was found in the two-dimensional gel analysis of meiotic DNA from S. cerevisiae. The mass of molecules in the spike, the timing of its appearance and disappearance, and its absence from a recombination-defective spo11 mutant are consistent with the hypothesis that it contains recombination intermediates. The spike changes in mass as predicted for joint molecules containing DNA from homologous chromosomes rather than sister chromatids in a strain heterozygous for an RFLP. Finally, joint molecules containing DNA from homeologous chromosomes were not found, suggesting that the block to recombination between homeologous sequences occurs prior to the formation of joint molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1487224455,"The therapeutically important anticoagulant heparin catalyzes inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III via formation of an intermediary ternary thrombin-heparin-antithrombin III complex that is subsequently converted to a stable thrombin-antithrombin III complex with the release of heparin. Point mutations at Arg-180, Arg-245, Lys-248, and Lys-252 in thrombin markedly reduced the efficiency of heparin catalysis by decreasing the stability of the ternary intermediate, whereas the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin alone was not affected by these mutations. These results together with an analysis of the x-ray crystal structure of thrombin yielded a model for the thrombin-heparin interaction, wherein heparin forms salt linkages along a groove in thrombin defined by Lys-252, Lys-248, Arg-245, Arg-89, Arg-98, and Arg-180."
https://openalex.org/W1567107115,"By performing DNase I footprint analysis, we had identified three distinct protein binding sequences (MT1, MT2, and MT3) located on the mouse thymidine kinase (TK) upstream promoter (Dou, Q.-P., Fridovich-Keil, J. L., and Pardee, A.B. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 88, 1157-1161). Here we report that MT2 includes an E2F-like binding site (GTTCGCGGGCAAA), as shown by the following evidence. (i) MT2 bound specifically to an affinity-purified fusion human E2F protein. (ii) Both MT2 and an authentic E2F site (TTTCGCGCGCTTT) bound specifically to similar or identical nuclear protein complexes. (iii) Formation of both these DNA-protein complexes were cell cycle-dependent: a G0/G1 phase-specific complex (E2F.G0/G1) was replaced by an S phase-specific complex(es) (E2F.S), whereas ""free"" E2F increased after the G1/S transition. (iv) Pulse inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide interchanged these complexes with similar kinetics. (v) When MT2-shifted E2F.G0/G1, E2F.S, and free E2F were eluted and analyzed by Western blot assay using a specific antiserum to human E2F-1, two forms of murine E2F (62 and 66 kDa) were observed from all three complexes. The compositions of these MT2-bound complexes were also investigated. Studies using specific antibodies revealed that p107, a retinoblastoma-like protein, was present in both E2F-G0/G1 and E2F.S, whereas cyclin E.cyclin A.cdk2 were only present in E2F.S complex(es). These data suggest that removal of the p107-containing E2F.G0/G1 complex, a candidate repressor, from the MT2 site in late G1 may be essential for S phase-dependent transcription of the mouse TK gene."
https://openalex.org/W2008717144,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) such as rhodopsin kinase and the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) play an important role in agonist-specific phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. GRK5 is a recently identified member of the GRK family that has greater homology with rhodopsin kinase than with beta ARK. To further characterize the activity of GRK5, it has been overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified by successive chromatography on S-Sepharose and Mono S columns. GRK5 phosphorylates the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR), m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor, and rhodopsin in an agonist-dependent manner to maximal stoichiometries of approximately 2.5, 1.5, and 1 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor, respectively, with Km values of approximately 0.5 microM for the beta 2AR, approximately 16 microM for rhodopsin, and approximately 24 microM for ATP. Peptide phosphorylation studies suggest that in contrast to beta ARK and rhodopsin kinase, GRK5 preferentially phosphorylates on nonacidic peptides with a Km of approximately 1.5 mM. Heparin and dextran sulfate were found to be potent inhibitors of GRK5 with IC50 values of approximately 1 nM, thereby being at least 150-fold more potent on GRK5 than on beta ARK. GRK5 can also be activated by polycations, with 10 microM polylysine promoting an approximately 2.6-fold activation. Overall, these studies demonstrate that GRK5 has unique properties that distinguish it from other members of the GRK family and that likely play an important role in modulating its mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W1485126530,"The fluctuations in the expression of two forms of DNA topoisomerase II, p170 and p180, were examined by immunoblotting during the transition of the growth state and the cell cycle in Swiss 3T3 cells. The level of p170 expression was higher during the exponentially growing phase than in the stationary phase, and the level of p180 did not appear to change when the cells changed the growth state. When quiescent cells were stimulated with serum, the p170 level began to increase at 12 h and reached a maximal level at 24-28 h, corresponding to the G2 phase. In contrast, the level of p180 was almost constant during the cell cycle, and the p180 band became obscure when the number of mitotic cells increased. Immunoblotting of the samples prepared from metaphase-synchronized HeLa cells did not have a p180 band, but did exhibit a band with a higher molecular weight. This band increased and p180 decreased in parallel with the increase in the number of mitotic cells. When the cells exited from the M phase, p180 reappeared and the higher molecular weight band disappeared."
https://openalex.org/W1586970933,"HNF1 and C/EBP alpha are transcription factors that bind to and trans-activate the human albumin gene proximal promoter. Various 5' deletions of the human albumin promoter were coupled to a luciferase reporter gene (alb-luc constructs) and co-electroporated with HNF1 and/or C/EBP alpha expression vectors into HeLa cells. Luciferase activities from co-electroporation of the HNF1 and C/EBP alpha expression vectors with the alb-luc constructs were approximately 10-fold greater than the sum of the activities achieved with HNF1 and C/EBP alpha alone. Analysis of COOH-terminal or internal deletions of the HNF1 expression vector revealed that the domain important for collaborative interaction with C/EBP alpha could be localized to a 157 amino acid region not previously described. This domain is proline and glutamine-rich and is highly homologous (66%) to a portion of vHNF1, an evolutionarily related gene first identified in dedifferentiated hepatoma cells. A construct linking the negatively charged activation domain of herpes simplex virus protein VP16 to the DNA-binding domain of HNF1 showed that it could also synergize with C/EBP alpha to trans-activate the human albumin gene promoter. Our studies delineate a domain in HNF1 important for synergistic activation with C/EBP alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1592540674,"Growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases can form stable associations with intracellular proteins that contain src homology (SH) 2 domains, including two proteins, Shc and Grb2, that are thought to lie upstream from the ras protooncogene in a signaling cascade. The phosphorylation and molecular associations of these proteins were evaluated in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells treated with nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin. Both NGF and EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins and their subsequent association with the receptors. In contrast, insulin had no effect on Shc phosphorylation, despite the expression of functional insulin receptors in these cells at levels comparable to those observed for NGF and EGF. NGF and EGF also induced the association of Shc proteins with a Grb2 fusion protein or endogenous Grb2, whereas insulin had no effect. All of the tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins associated with the Grb2 fusion protein, although only about half of the endogenous Shc was phosphorylated in response to NGF or EGF. However, all three hormones induced the association of several additional tyrosine phosphorylated proteins with Grb2, some of which also coprecipitated with antiserum against the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Moreover, these growth factors stimulated the association of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity with the Grb2 fusion protein, although this activity was not detected in anti-Shc immunoprecipitates. These results provide further evidence for the divergence of signaling pathways in insulin action, and suggest that Grb2 forms separate complexes with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in PC-12 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1490497276,"We have isolated a new human cDNA, named IFP 35, whose expression is regulated by interferons (IFN). Induction of IFP 35 mRNA in HeLa cells by IFN is due, at least in part, to increased transcription. In response to IFN treatment, the expression of IFP 35 mRNA is seen in a wide range of different cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, and epithelial cells. The cDNA sequence encodes a 282-amino acid protein with a deduced molecular mass of 31,130 Da. In vitro translation of mRNA obtained by both in vitro transcription and hybrid selection resulted in the synthesis of a 35-kDa protein. Antisera raised against IFP 35 recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa in HeLa cells. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a leucine zipper motif in an alpha-helical configuration at the extreme amino terminus of IFP 35. Notable IFP 35 is a unique novel leucine zipper protein in that it lacks a basic domain critical for DNA binding. IFP 35 can specifically form homodimers in vitro. Western blot analysis of fractionated cell extracts indicates increased nuclear localization following IFN treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1543146853,"DNA replication from the Epstein-Barr virus latent origin of replication, oriP, is activated by Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1). This activation involves the binding of EBNA1 dimers to multiple sites present in the two noncontiguous functional elements of oriP, the dyad symmetry element (DS) from which replication initiates, and the family of repeats (FR) enhancer element. EBNA1 complexes formed on the FR and DS elements of oriP interact by a DNA looping mechanism. This interaction requires EBNA1 sequences in addition to those required for DNA binding and dimerization. To map the EBNA1 sequences required for the efficient interaction of FR- and DS-bound EBNA1 complexes, we have overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified a series of EBNA1 N-terminal truncation mutants, all of which retain the DNA binding and dimerization domains. The results of electron microscopy and ligation-enhancement assays using these mutants indicated that EBNA1 sequences between amino acids 350 and 361 are required for the efficient interaction of FR- and DS-bound EBNA1 complexes. EBNA1-mediated FR-DS interactions were shown to stabilize EBNA1 binding to the DS element, while EBNA1-mediated DS-DS interactions did not. These results suggest that the stabilization of EBNA1 on the DS element, which occurs as a result of EBNA1-mediate oriP looping, may be important for the activation of DNA replication from the DS element."
https://openalex.org/W1630913723,"We have previously reported the existence of two different molecular species of protein methylase (S-adenosylmethionine:protein-arginine N-methyltransferase, E.C. 2.1.1.23) in calf brain, one specific for myelin basic protein and the other for (Ghosh, S. K., Paik, W. K., and Kim, S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 19024-19033). In the present study, however, we report that heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle protein A1 is most likely an in vivo substrate for the histone-specific protein methylase I. The unmethylated recombinant protein A1 has been found to be a much superior methyl acceptor for the enzyme than with a Km value two orders of magnitude lower (0.19 microM) than that for (21 microM). Myelin basic protein, a specific inhibitor for protein methylase I, exhibited a lower IC50 for protein A1 methylation (IC50 = 33 microM) compared with methylation (IC50 = 220 microM) and competitively inhibited the former with a Ki value of 1.3 x 10(-6) M. The extent of inhibition of protein A1 and methylation by the polyclonal antibodies prepared against purified histone protein methylase I was identical. Maximally, 1.08-mol methyl groups were incorporated per mol of protein A1, which was 27-fold higher than that of (0.04 mol/mol of histone). HPLC analysis of the enzymatically methylated amino acid residues in protein A1 revealed the formation of NG-monomethylarginine and NG,NG-dimethylarginine. The ratio of NG,NG-dimethylarginine/NG-monomethylarginine increased as a function of incubation period; however, NG,N'G-dimethylarginine was not detectable. Proteolytic cleavage of the methyl-3H-labeled recombinant protein A1 by trypsin and Staphylococcus aureus V8 endoprotease indicated that protein A1 possesses multiple sites for methylation, one of which was identified as residue 194 arginine, which coincided with the in vivo methylation site."
https://openalex.org/W2094088877,"In vivo psoralen cross-linking of the trypanosome spliced leader (SL) RNA has led to the discovery of a small RNA that we provisionally call the spliced leader-associated (SLA) RNA. The 72 nt SLA RNA is unlike any known small RNA except for a small region that resembles U5 snRNA. The SL/SLA RNA cross-links map to two regions, the predominant interactions occurring between the 5' splice site region of the SL RNA and a CUUUUA sequence in the SLA RNA. The resemblance between these cross-links and interactions of U5 snRNA with cis-spliced pre-mRNAs suggests that the SLA RNA may be the trans-splicing analog of U5 snRNA in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1590884773,"The regulation of glial-specific JC virus early gene expression was addressed by functional dissection of a previously uncharacterized form of the JC virus promoter (MH-1). The MH-1 promoter directed 31-fold higher reporter gene expression in U87MG glioma cells than in HeLa cells in a transient transfection assay. Transfection of promoter constructs containing proximal or proximal plus upstream regions revealed that reporter gene expression was activated by both proximal and tandem repeat regions in glioma cells. The proximal region contains a guanine-rich sequence, the GA box, which was found to regulate the promoter, and was recognized specifically by the transcription factor Sp1. The GA box is also present in the promoters of three glial-specific cellular genes. Together with paired AP-1 and NF-1 sites in the tandem repeats, the GA box is part of a motif that is conserved between several glial-specific promoters, and is thus a potential determinant of glial-specific gene expression. These results delineate the promoter regions required for activation of the MH-1 JC virus promoter, suggest a new determinant of glial specificity, and establish a model for the investigation of combinatorial activation of a glial-specific viral promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1594836832,"Gene 59 of bacteriophage T4 is involved in genetic recombination and recombination-dependent DNA replication. We purified the protein encoded by gene 59 after cloning the gene in an expression vector. The molecular weight and the sequence of seven N-terminal amino acids of the protein were consistent with the nucleotide sequence of the gene (Hahn, S., Kruse, U., and Ruger, W. (1986) Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 9311-9327). The purified 59 protein appeared to be a monomer under nondenaturing conditions, and it bound to single-stranded DNA in preference to double-stranded DNA. The protein could bind to a 24-nucleotide-long single-stranded DNA molecule that had previously bound either 32 protein (single-stranded DNA-binding protein) or uvsY protein (enhancer of uvsX protein), but it would not bind to this DNA if it had previously bound uvsX protein (synaptase). The binding occurred rapidly with 32 protein-bound DNA and slowly with uvsY protein-bound DNA. Accordingly, 32 protein bound specifically to an agarose matrix containing immobilized 59 protein. The 41 protein (DNA helicase) also bound specifically to this agarose matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1574854999,"Cell-matrix interactions and intergrin-type cell adhesion receptors are involved in the regulation of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We have analyzed the expression of matrix proteins and their cellular receptors in human osteosarcoma cells (HOS) and in their virally (KHOS-NP) and chemically (HOS-MNNG) transformed tumorigenic subclones. Transformation decreased dramatically the cellular mRNA levels of alpha 1(I) collagen. Concomitantly with down-regulation of collagen mRNA levels the synthesis of the collagen receptor, alpha 2 beta 1 integrin, was induced. No alpha 2 integrin mRNA was found in HOS cells, suggesting that its expression was regulated most probably at the transcriptional level. 5-Azacytidine alone or combined with alpha 2 integrin-stimulating cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta 1, and interleukin-1 beta, did not turn on the alpha 2 integrin gene. In chemically transformed cells, however, alpha 2 integrin expression could be regulated by cytokines. Thus, we suggest that HOS cells have a strong element, probably other than cell culture-generated de novo promoter methylation, suppressing alpha 2 integrin expression and that this factor is lost in both chemical and viral transformation. Furthermore, the mechanism used by cytokines and malignant transformation to increase alpha 2 integrin expression seems not to be identical. Other transformation-related changes in beta 1 integrins were (i) reduction of the intracellular pool of precursor beta 1 (in HOS-MNNG cells), leading to faster maturation rate of beta 1 subunit and slower maturation rate of alpha subunits, and (ii) decreased electrophoretic mobility of both alpha and beta 1 subunits. At the cellular level both chemical and viral transformation increased cell adhesion to type I collagen."
https://openalex.org/W1523805343,"It was previously reported that disruption or deletion of QCR6, the nuclear gene encoding subunit 6 of the cytochrome bc1 complex, does not impair growth of yeast on non-fermentable carbon sources (Schoppink, P.

We have discovered that deletion of QCR6 results in a temperature-sensitive petite phenotype, manifested at 37 degrees C, and that this phenotype can be masked by spontaneously arising suppressor mutations. Mitochondrial membranes from the deletion strain grown at 37 degrees C lack ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase activity, and optical spectra reveal an extensive decrease in cytochrome b absorption, but little or no decrease in cytochrome c1 absorption. Immunoblots of mitochondrial membrane proteins from the deletion strain indicate that processing of cytochrome c1 from intermediate to mature size is blocked coincident with the loss of subunit 6. This is the first example where mutation of a subunit within the bc1 complex blocks maturation of cytochrome c1."
https://openalex.org/W1512039680,"The effect of ascorbic acid on glucose-induced insulin release from single pancreatic islets was measured using a new, ultra-sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent insulin assay. Within 20 s ascorbic acid inhibited insulin secretion; inhibition was dose dependent and completely reversible. There was a 50% inhibition of the secretory response with 200 microM ascorbic acid and 90% inhibition with 400 microM ascorbic acid. The decrease in insulin secretion was recorded as a reduction of the amplitudes of the fast insulin transients, which give rise to the oscillatory nature of insulin secretion. The inhibition of glucose-induced insulin release by ascorbic acid was associated with hyperpolarization of the pancreatic beta-cell. Suppression of glucose-induced membrane depolarization was evident after 20 s, was dose dependent, and was completely reversible. The data here may provide the first explanation of why plasma ascorbate concentrations are tightly controlled."
https://openalex.org/W1514951030,"Abstract The melibiose carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae couples sugar transport to H+ and Li+, while that of Escherichia coli uses Na+ besides the other two cation species (Hama and Wilson, 1992). We have shown that the K. pneumoniae melibiose carrier is capable of recognizing Na+ when the amino-terminal 81 residues are replaced by the corresponding region of the E. coli melibiose carrier (Hama and Wilson, 1993). In this amino-terminal region there are 5 residues that are not conserved between the two carriers. In this study, we changed each of the 5 residues of the K. pneumoniae carrier to the one in the E. coli carrier. The substitutions are Ile-36-->Val, Val-43-->Leu, Leu-54-->Trp, Ala-58-->Asn, and Cys-68-->Ala. With four of the five mutants, Ile-36-->Val, Val-43-->Leu, Leu-54-->Trp, and Cys-68-->Ala, sugar accumulation was not affected by Na+. In striking contrast, melibiose and methyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside accumulation was greatly stimulated by Na+ with the Ala-58-->Asn mutant. Furthermore, Na+ uptake coupled to downhill melibiose transport was observed with the Ala-58-->Asn mutant. These results indicate that the Ala-58-->Asn substitution enables the K. pneumoniae melibiose carrier to couple sugar transport to Na+. It is clear that the Asn-58 residue (Asn-54 in the E. coli carrier) is involved in Na+ recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1534969211,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are ligand-dependent nuclear transcription factors that are encoded by two different genes, TR alpha and TR beta, and bind to thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the promoters of thyroid hormone (T3)-regulated genes. Retinoid X receptors (RXRs), major members of the thyroid hormone receptor auxiliary proteins, have recently been shown to enhance the binding of TRs to TREs. We previously showed that TRs extracted from rat pituitary GH3 cells retain ligand (T3) and DNA binding specificity and stimulate rat growth hormone (rGH) promoter activity in a cell-free in vitro transcription system. In this report, we have studied further how T3 activates endogenous TRs and stimulates transcription from different TRE-containing promoters. We found that T3 (10(-8) M) selectively stimulates transcription from rGH-TRE- and TREpal-, but not ME-TRE- and F2-TRE-, containing templates in which these TREs are linked in front of the rGH minimal promoter containing only the TATA box binding protein, but not any other proximal binding protein, sequence. In contrast, only the TREpal/AdML template, in which TREpal oligonucleotide was linked in front of the adenovirus major late gene (AdML) minimal promoter, was stimulated by T3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrates that endogenous TR complexes specifically bind to either natural or idealized TRE (rGH-TRE, TREpal, ME-TRE, and F2-TRE) oligonucleotides. To further understand these receptor-DNA complexes formed on various TREs, isoform-specific anti-receptor antisera (TR alpha, TR beta 1, TR beta 2, and RXR beta) were added in the EMSA. These antisera differentially supershifted TR.DNA complexes formed on the TREs. These data suggest either that endogenous TR isoforms and RXR beta may form different complexes on the various TREs or that TR.RXR complexes have distinct conformations when bound to the various TREs. Taken together, these data suggest that particular TREs in which specific TR.RXR complexes are formed and different minimal promoters may provide specificity in T3-mediated transcriptional stimulation of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1664491839,"It has been demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence, serine-lysine-leucine (SKL), is sufficient to direct a polypeptide to peroxisomes in vivo, and that this sequence is functional in plants, animals, and yeasts. Furthermore, many peroxisomal proteins have SKL carboxyl termini, including rat acyl-CoA oxidase. We have synthesized a 125I-peptide with the sequence of the last 12 amino acids of acyl-CoA oxidase, D-Tyr-HKHLKPLQSKL (SKLp), and used it to detect a receptor that recognizes SKL containing proteins targeted to glyoxysomes. SKLp binding to alkali-stripped glyoxysomal membranes was saturable and 80% of the binding could be displaced by 1 microM unlabeled SKLp or 8 micrograms/ml glyoxysomal matrix proteins. Very little specific binding was associated with endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondrial membranes. Specific binding was affected by the ionic composition of the medium; the binding was optimal at pH 6.5 and was inhibited by mono- and divalent cations. Scatchard analysis of SKLp binding to glyoxysomal membranes indicated that there were two binding sites with Kd values of 160 and 1450 nM and abundances of 17 and 43 nmol/mg glyoxysomal membrane protein, respectively. Protease treatment of the alkali-stripped glyoxysomal membranes lowered the number of high affinity sites and destroyed all the low affinity sites. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that there is an integral membrane protein in glyoxysomes that has the characteristics of a receptor for protein import."
https://openalex.org/W1582045337,"A genetically engineered human myoglobin (Mb) in which the distal His, His64(E7), and the distal Val, Val68(E11), are replaced by Val and His, respectively, has been expressed in Escherichia coli, for the purpose of assessing the potential role of a E11 residue in providing a hydrogen bond donor to the coordinated ligand. Molecular modeling indicates that such an interaction is possible. The 1H NMR spectrum of the ferric form of the double mutant Mb exhibits large hyperfine shifts and strong paramagnetic relaxation for which the temperature dependence of the hyperfine shifts reveals a thermal equilibrium between a low-spin and high-spin state (70, 30% at 25 degrees C, respectively). Standard sequence specific two-dimensional (2D) NMR assignments of the E and F helical backbones allow the identification of the peptide protons for the proximal His93(F8) and substituted distal His68(E11). Steady-state nuclear Overhauser effect from these peptide protons locate strongly hyperfine shifted His93(F8) and His68(E11) side chain protons which dictate that both the imidazole rings are coordinated to the iron. 2D bond correlation and one-dimensional and 2D dipolar correlation experiments locate and assign the resonances for the heme. The pattern of the heme contact shifts in both the low-spin and high-spin state, together with the nature of the temperature dependence of the His93(F8) and His68(E11) resonances, establish that the two His are ligated in the high-spin as well as low-spin forms. The pattern of heme methyl hyperfine shifts in the low-spin state, and the smaller hyperfine shifts for His68(E11) as compared to His93(F8) in the high-spin state, indicate that the axial bond to the distal His68(E11) is weakened or strained as compared with that for the proximal His93(F8) in both spin states. This weak ligation originates from a tilted iron-His68 bond, the only conformation in which His68 can place its imidazole group sufficiently close to bind to the heme iron in the conventional Mb folding. Not only do these results support the belief that distal His is indispensable for the control of the ligand binding in Mb and hemoglobin, but also reveal the significance of the evolution that the stereochemical disposition of both His64 and Val68 are unique and non-exchangeable for interacting with the bound ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1599123349,"We have examined the sequence constraints on the amino-terminal region of the mature portion of alkaline phosphatase that are important for its efficient transport in Escherichia coli. Using a homopolymeric sequence of serines to replace 6 residues in this region, a transport-incompetent mutant was produced. Reintroduction of residues from the native sequence which restore charge and beta-turn potential resulted in little improvement. However, by replacing the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide with a homopolymeric series of leucines, not only was transport restored but precursor processing was more efficient than for the wild type and was insensitive to disruption of the protonmotive force. Moreover, we have titrated the signal peptide with leucine to alanine substitutions (Doud, S. K., Chou, M. M., and Kendall, D. A. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 1251-1256) and determined the minimum level of hydrophobicity necessary to achieve transport of the mutant protein. The results indicate that signal peptide hydrophobicity can completely override possible requirements for negatively charged residues and strong beta-turn forming potential in the mature protein and that the polyleucine-containing signal peptide may act as a generic signal sequence for the transport of non-native proteins in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1561482368,"The modulation of intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by cAMP was compared in pancreatic beta-cells of lean (+/+) and obese (ob/ob) mice. Neither forskolin nor 8-bromo-cAMP significantly affected basal [Ca2+]i in unstimulated lean and obese mouse beta-cells. In obese, but not in lean mouse beta-cells, adding forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP during the glucose-induced [Ca2+]i response triggered external Ca(2+)-dependent [Ca2+]i oscillations with a duration of 5-11 s and a frequency of 2.3-4.8 min-1. The induction of oscillations by cAMP required both a stimulatory glucose concentration and membrane depolarization. (Sp)-cAMPS, did induce oscillations in lean mouse beta-cells. However, these oscillations were different from those seen in obese mouse beta-cells and required higher concentrations of (Sp)-cAMPS. The inducibility of fast oscillations in obese mouse beta-cells indicates hypersensitivity of these cells to cAMP, and suggests an abnormal behavior of K+ and/or Ca2+ channels."

When rm was plotted as a function of the concentration of ATP a biphasic response was observed with a hyperbolic component of high affinity (Km = 15.7 +/- 2.6 microM) and low velocity ((rm)max = 460 +/- 40 nmol of Pi/(mg of protein.s)) plus a parabolic component which showed no saturation up to 1000 microM ATP, concentration at which rm was 1768.1 +/- 429.6 nmol Pi/(mg protein.s) (mean +/- S.E.; n = 3). This low affinity effect of ATP on the rate of phosphorylation disappeared when the Na,K-ATPase underwent turnover in medium without K+ suggesting that, like superphosphorylation (Peluffo, R. D., Garrahan, P. J., and Rega, A. F. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6596-6601), it required the enzyme to be at rest. This property of the Na,K-ATPase was not predicted by the Albers-Post reaction scheme. The observed behavior of the enzyme could be simulated by a scheme that involves a resting enzyme (Er) functionally different from E1 or E2, which is able to bind three molecules of ATP, one with high and two with low affinity, and that after phosphorylation is converted into the phosphointermediates that are generally considered to participate in the reaction cycle described by Albers and Post."
