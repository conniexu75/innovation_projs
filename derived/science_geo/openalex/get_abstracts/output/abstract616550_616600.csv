https://openalex.org/W2886555678,"Pattern recognition in imaging data by >300,000 players of a global, online, commercial computer game is combined with deep learning to improve the accuracy of annotation of subcellular protein localization. Pattern recognition and classification of images are key challenges throughout the life sciences. We combined two approaches for large-scale classification of fluorescence microscopy images. First, using the publicly available data set from the Cell Atlas of the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we integrated an image-classification task into a mainstream video game (EVE Online) as a mini-game, named Project Discovery. Participation by 322,006 gamers over 1 year provided nearly 33 million classifications of subcellular localization patterns, including patterns that were not previously annotated by the HPA. Second, we used deep learning to build an automated Localization Cellular Annotation Tool (Loc-CAT). This tool classifies proteins into 29 subcellular localization patterns and can deal efficiently with multi-localization proteins, performing robustly across different cell types. Combining the annotations of gamers and deep learning, we applied transfer learning to create a boosted learner that can characterize subcellular protein distribution with F1 score of 0.72. We found that engaging players of commercial computer games provided data that augmented deep learning and enabled scalable and readily improved image classification."

Here, we characterized interactions between 3,164 LC cell pairs in the rat LC under urethane anesthesia. Spike count correlations were near zero and only a small proportion of unit pairs had synchronized spontaneous (15%) or evoked (16%) discharge. We identified infra-slow (0.01–1 Hz) fluctuations of LC unit spike rate, which were also asynchronous across the population. Despite overall sparse population synchrony, we report the existence of LC ensembles and relate them to forebrain projection targets. We also show that spike waveform width was related to ensemble membership, propensity for synchronization, and interactions with cortex.

Neuromodulation has long been seen as a “one-to-many” activity due to diffuse efferents of neuromodulatory nuclei and volume transmission (Mitchell et al., 1994Mitchell K. Oke A.F. Adams R.N.

Neuromodulatory nuclei, as hubs of the brainstem arousal systems, are often considered to be undifferentiated “state controllers” (Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005Aston-Jones G. Cohen J.D.

Example par excellence is the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC); its diffuse projections are conserved across vertebrates (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981aAston-Jones G. Bloom F.E.

However, recent studies have challenged this one-to-many configuration and, instead, suggested a one-to-one and/or ensemble-based organization, by showing that target-selective pathways originating from discrete LC sub-populations affect different behaviors (Chandler et al., 2014Chandler D.J.

These new findings encourage further investigation of the role of LC sub-population projection specificity and the possibility that activity within those sub-populations is correlated. Even with target-selective projections, however, the LC would only be able to affect different brain regions when its neurons are not all synchronized and if they can fire in distinct, ensemble-based patterns. Previous seminal studies have begun to address synchronous activity in the LC but provide a partly contrasting and still incomplete view especially with regard to beyond-pairwise single-unit ensembles and the spatial and temporal scales over which synchrony is expressed. Extracellular recordings of LC spiking in awake and anesthetized rats and slice recordings of local field and membrane potentials have provided indirect evidence for widespread synchrony (Alvarez et al., 2002Alvarez V.A. Chow C.C. Van Bockstaele E.J. Williams J.T. Frequency-dependent synchrony in locus ceruleus: role of electrotonic coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Williams J.T. Synchronous activity in locus coeruleus results from dendritic interactions in pericoerulear regions.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5196-5204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, sensory stimuli elicit single-unit spikes that are highly synchronous with multi-unit spiking of surrounding population (Chen and Sara, 2007Chen F.-J. Sara S.J. Locus coeruleus activation by foot shock or electrical stimulation inhibits amygdala neurons.Neuroscience. 2007; 144: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, the local field potential (LFP, a marker of transmembrane currents and other peri-synaptic activity), with which multi-unit activity (MUA) is synchronized, is coherent between spatially segregated sites in the LC and suggests synchronous activity throughout the nucleus (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981bAston-Jones G.

Synchronous activity in locus coeruleus results from dendritic interactions in pericoerulear regions.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5196-5204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct evidence for synchrony was demonstrated using cross-correlogram measures from 23 pairs of single units recorded in monkeys during various states of vigilance (Usher et al., 1999Usher M. Cohen J.D. Servan-Schreiber D. Rajkowski J. Aston-Jones G. The role of locus coeruleus in the regulation of cognitive performance.Science. 1999; 283: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). However, in vitro studies suggest that synchrony may be quite low or only increase in the presence of specific neurotransmitter (e.g., hypocretin) drive (Christie et al., 1989Christie M.J.

One potential gap in the aforementioned evidence is that it has relied on indiscriminate multi-unit spiking or recordings of only two single units simultaneously. Evidently, such measurements do not allow an assessment of potential ensemble-based spike patterns. Interpreting the emerging perspectives for targeted neuromodulation by an LC ensemble code would also benefit from knowledge about the spatial and temporal structure of population activity within the LC and its relation to projection specificity of individual LC neurons. In earlier studies, the available tools were technically prohibitive for ensemble recordings because the small size of the LC permitted mainly single-electrode implantations. Additionally, the single-unit waveforms of the densely packed LC cell bodies are difficult to isolate. Here, we overcame these obstacles by using a high-density recording array to collect the first large-scale population data from the LC. We recorded, in total, 234 units (up to 52 single units per rat) under urethane anesthesia and analyzed 3,164 unit pairs. Stable long-duration recording of single units permitted statistically robust evaluation of spike train synchrony. Acute experiments also allowed characterization of units’ projection patterns by their antidromic responses to stimulation of 15 forebrain sites. Here, we report that the degree of synchrony in large populations of simultaneously recorded LC single units is rather low during a brain state with predominant slow-wave dynamics. We also demonstrate the presence of simultaneously active, yet distinct LC ensembles that exhibit synchrony among neurons over slow (seconds) to fast (sub-millisecond) timescales. Ensemble firing patterns in the LC may allow circuit-based neuromodulation. We isolated 234 single units in 12 rats (5–52 units per rat; Table 1). All single units exhibited typical characteristics of putative noradrenergic LC cells (Figure S1). Extracellular recordings do not allow unambiguous identification of cell neurochemical identity or location. Therefore, we used an agonist (clonidine) for the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor to demonstrate a complete cessation of firing of the recorded units (Figure S10). Nearby structures could have contributed low-amplitude spikes, but they are not inhibited by clonidine due to the lack alpha-2 adrenoreceptors (McCune et al., 1993McCune S.K. Voigt M.M. Hill J.M. Expression of multiple alpha adrenergic receptor subtype messenger RNAs in the adult rat brain.Neuroscience. 1993; 57: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). We also histologically verified the location of the electrode tract within the LC core (Figure S9).Table 1The Number of LC Single Units Recorded in Each RatRat IdentifierNumber of Single UnitsNumber (%) of Narrow UnitsNumber (%) of Wide Units959.175 (71)2 (29)980.499 (100)0 (0)105.150 (0)5 (100)105.25210 (19)42 (81)109.1210 (0)21 (100)134.2150 (0)15 (100)259.1180 (0)18 (100)259.2274 (15)23 (85)263.2362 (6)34 (94)286.383 (38)5 (62)288.160 (0)6 (100)288.2301 (3.3)29 (96.7)The numbers and percent of each unit separated by waveform width. Open table in a new tab The numbers and percent of each unit separated by waveform width. Extracellular waveforms separated into two groups based on spike width and after-hyperpolarization amplitude (Figures 1A and 1B ). We refer to these populations as “narrow” and “wide” units. Out of 234 units, 34 were narrow (15%) and 200 were wide (85%). Waveform width was significantly different between narrow and wide units (0.462 ± 0.021 ms versus 1.082 ± 0.010 ms; t test, T(232) = −24.56, p < 0.0001). Waveform amplitude was similar (t test, T(232) = 0.599, p = 0.550), with average amplitudes of 0.136 ± 0.019 mV (narrow) and 0.129 ± 0.004 mV (wide). Both narrow and wide units had identical response profiles to foot shocks with short-latency excitation followed by prolonged inhibition and both were inhibited by clonidine (Figure S1). Stimulation of forebrain sites elicited antidromic responses in similar percentages of narrow (30%) and wide (38%) units (two-sided, Fisher’s exact test, odds ratio = 1.41, CI = [0.349 5.714], p = 0.744). Thus, both subsets of units can be classified as putative NE-producing, forebrain-projecting LC neurons. Interestingly, waveform width overlapped with a number of characteristic differences. Narrow units discharged at significantly higher rates (Figures 1C and 1D; median and SD, 1.28 ± 0.73 spikes/s and 0.64 ± 0.63 spikes/s, respectively; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Z = 4.23, p = 0.00002, Cohen’s D = 0.823, power = 0.973). Also, narrow units were more predominant in the ventral aspect of the nucleus (Figure 1E). This distribution was present in all 12 rats. A seminal early study clearly demonstrated highly synchronous spiking of LC neurons (80% out of 23 single-unit pairs) in monkeys during periods of accurate performance of a cognitive choice task (Usher et al., 1999Usher M. Cohen J.D. Servan-Schreiber D. Rajkowski J. Aston-Jones G. The role of locus coeruleus in the regulation of cognitive performance.Science. 1999; 283: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Based on this result, pairwise spike count correlation coefficients and the proportion of significant cross-correlograms for the LC population are expected to greatly exceed the values reported for cortex, which are, respectively, 0.1 and 32 (16%) of 200 pairs (Cohen and Kohn, 2011Cohen M.R. Kohn A. Measuring and interpreting neuronal correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, Engel et al., 1990Engel A.K. König P. Gray C.M. Singer W. Stimulus-dependent neuronal oscillations in cat visual cortex: inter-columnar interaction as determined by cross-correlation analysis.Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 588-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In order to estimate correlated firing in the LC, we calculated spike count correlation coefficients (RSC) for 3,164 single-unit pairs in bins of 200 ms and 1 s, which were chosen based on the 100–200 ms duration of coincidental spiking reported in LC cross-correlograms (Usher et al., 1999Usher M. Cohen J.D. Servan-Schreiber D. Rajkowski J. Aston-Jones G. The role of locus coeruleus in the regulation of cognitive performance.Science. 1999; 283: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) and the previously demonstrated relationship between rhythmic increases of LC MUA in relation to cortical 1–2 Hz slow waves (Eschenko et al., 2012Eschenko O. Magri C. Panzeri S. Sara S.J. Noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus are phase locked to cortical up-down states during sleep.Cereb.

USA. 2015; 112: 12834-12839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). RSC values were distributed around zero (Figure 2). The SEM was 0.044 ± 0.001 for 200 ms bins and 0.098 ± 0.003 for 1 s bins. RSC did not depend on a distance between the units (Figure S2A). One factor to consider is that anesthesia may have inflated the measured RSC values, which are higher in the cortex under various types of anesthesia in both rodents and monkeys as compared to awake states (Aasebø et al., 2017Aasebø I.E.J. Lepperød M.E. Stavrinou M. Nøkkevangen S. Einevoll G. Hafting T. Fyhn M.

The increased cortical synchrony is due to temporal compacting of cortical population spiking into particular periods (up states) of the slow EEG/LFP oscillations that occur during anesthesia or natural sleep. The LC exhibits burst-like population firing during cortical slow oscillation states (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981aAston-Jones G. Bloom F.E.

USA. 2015; 112: 12834-12839Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and may therefore also have higher inter-neuronal synchrony during the states with the prevalence of cortical slow LFP oscillations. In line with this prediction, we found that LC pairwise correlations were higher when the cortex was in a more synchronized (LFP slow oscillation) compared to a less synchronized (“activated”) state (Figure S3). To account for the role of network activity, we developed a non-parametric permutation test of significance that discounts spurious correlations due to non-random inter-spike intervals and common locking to, for example, cortical slow oscillations. Only 16% of pairs had synchronous spiking that was significantly higher than what would be expected to occur by chance (one-sided permutation test, p < 0.01). Another important factor to consider is anesthesia-induced suppression of firing rate because lower firing rates lead to lower RSC values due to non-linear spike thresholds (de la Rocha et al., 2007de la Rocha J.

To assess this factor, we separately analyzed 2,658 unit pairs with a geometric mean rate of <1 Hz and compared them to 506 unit pairs with a geometric mean rate that was similar to the awake spike rate (>1 Hz) in rats and monkeys (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981aAston-Jones G.

Only 19.2% of higher rate pairs had significantly positive RSC values, which was similar to the percentage (15.8%) of lower rate pairs. Thus, correlated spiking is not predominant between pairs of LC neurons, even when firing rate is quantitatively similar to those observed in the awake state. Sensory stimuli evoke burst spiking of LC neurons, which may be a homogeneous population response to each stimulus (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981bAston-Jones G. Bloom F.E.

To study correlations between evoked LC spiking activity, we applied a single foot shock (5.0 mA, 0.5 ms pulse duration) and measured spike count correlations during the time window of the maximal evoked discharge (50 ms after stimulation; see red spikes in Figure 3A).

Mean evoked RSC values were distributed around zero (Figure 2). Increasing the stimulus intensity to 5 pulses (at 30 Hz) did not increase synchrony (single pulse, 0.007 ± 0.006 versus 30 Hz, 0.012 ± 0.006, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, Z = 1.24, p = 0.214). Moreover, accounting for possible adaptation by calculating correlations in blocks of 5 trials (e.g., trials 1–5, 6–10, and so on) did not demonstrate any propensity for higher correlations during earlier stimulation trials for either stimulation intensity (single pulse, Kruskal-Wallis H = 0.68, p = 0.711; 30 Hz, Kruskal-Wallis H = 0.69, p = 0.709). Thus, the low trial-by-trial evoked correlations suggest that individual units respond independently from each other on every trial. Indeed, within 50 ms after a foot shock a robust population response is easily observed, yet on average only 16% of units responded on each trial of a single foot shock (Figure 3). The proportion of neurons responding to the stimulus in each trial remained relatively low when the post-stimulus window was increased to 100 ms (20% of units) or 200 ms (28% of units). Thus, the LC response to arousing stimuli in states characterized by slow waves (anesthesia and perhaps sleep) is not necessarily a unitary population burst. We further examined RSC between pairs of narrow or wide units, as well as between pairs consisting of one narrow and one wide unit (mixed). Correlations among each type of pair were similar for spontaneous spiking (Welch’s F(2,3161) = 1.42, p = 0.245, ω2 = 0.0003). Evoked correlations may differ by unit pair type, but the Kruskal-Wallis test was under-powered (H = 7.64, p = 0.022, ω2 = 0.0003, power = 0.175). Post hoc tests suggest that pairs of mixed units may have a more negative median correlation than pairs of wide-type units (p = 0.017). Nevertheless, the mean RSC values were near zero for all pair types, which suggests that neither narrow nor wide units formed a highly correlated sub-population. Strikingly, a large number of negative RSC values emerged during evoked activity. Furthermore, negatively correlated pairs were observed primarily when the pair included a wide unit (Figure 2, arrows). Negative correlations, specifically after sensory stimuli, may reflect lateral inhibition. Local noradrenergic inhibition is generated by somatic release of NE that occurs during the high frequency of spiking associated with sensory-evoked responses (Huang et al., 2"

A common theme that could relate these various cognitive operations is the involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and indeed the CLA connects most densely with the PFC (Atlan et al., 2017Atlan G.

Given the high degree of connectivity with the PFC, the CLA is likely to play an important role in the cortical control of behavior. However, little is known about how CLA activity impacts the cortex in general or the PFC in particular. Previous studies have shown that the CLA can exert either an excitatory or an inhibitory influence on cortical activity (Cortimiglia et al., 1991Cortimiglia R. Crescimanno G. Salerno M.T. Amato G. The role of the claustrum in the bilateral control of frontal oculomotor neurons in the cat.Exp.

Effects of claustrum stimulation on spontaneous bioelectrical activity of motor cortex neurons in the cat.Exp. Neurol. 1984; 86: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), leaving an unresolved picture of how the CLA influences cortical processing. While anatomical evidence shows that CLA outputs target both inhibitory and excitatory cells within cortical circuits (da Costa et al., 2010da Costa N.M. Fürsinger D. Martin K.A.C. The synaptic organization of the claustral projection to the cat’s visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13166-13170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, LeVay, 1986LeVay S.

The visual claustrum of the cat. I. Structure and connections.J. Neurosci. 1981; 1: 956-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are no physiological data demonstrating how CLA activity alters the firing dynamics of different cortical cell types. Therefore, both the overall and the specific effects of the CLA on the cortex remain unclear. To address these questions, we investigated the impact of CLA activity on the PFC and the cell-type-specific mechanisms underlying this communication. In order to specifically label and manipulate CLA cells projecting to the PFC, we injected AAVretro-syn-Cre (Tervo et al., 2016Tervo D.G.R. Hwang B.Y. Viswanathan S. Gaj T. Lavzin M. Ritola K.D. Lindo S. Michael S. Kuleshova E. Ojala D. et al.A designer AAV variant permits efficient retrograde access to projection neurons.Neuron. 2016; 92: 372-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) into the anterior cingulate (ACC), prelimbic (PL), and secondary motor (M2) cortex of wild-type mice or rats. The resulting retrograde transport of Cre into neurons that project to the PFC allowed us to functionally isolate the CLA, because neighboring brain regions, such as the striatum and insula, do not project (or project very weakly) to the PFC (Figure 1A). We then injected AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP into the CLA to target this restricted population of Cre-labeled claustrocortical projection neurons for optogenetic stimulation (Figure 1A). We first examined the topography of CLA axons in the brain. Axons from claustrocortical ChR2-eYFP-labeled neurons were found to densely innervate all layers of the PFC, with a preference for deep layers (Figure 1B). Axon collaterals were found throughout the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and perirhinal cortex (PRC), with weaker innervation of sensory cortex (Figure S1). Superficial layers were more densely labeled in midline structures relative to lateral cortical regions such as sensory cortex and PRC, which mainly received inputs to the deep layers (Figure S1). Neurons in the CLA responded robustly to ChR2 stimulation, which drove spikes with 1–2 ms latency in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1C). To determine the influence of CLA activity on cortical firing patterns, we recorded from putative pyramidal cells (PCs) and interneurons (INs) in the PFC in awake head-fixed mice during CLA stimulation (single 5 ms-long light pulse every 5 s, <10 mW; Figures 1D–1J). The CLA sends excitatory projections to the cortex; thus we expected that activation of this pathway would yield excitation of PCs. However, we detected excitation in only 2/90 PC recordings. CLA activation evoked strong suppression of PC firing rates, and in 33% (30/90) of PC recordings activity was completely silenced (Figures 1E, 1G, 1H, and 1J). Following this initial suppression, many neurons displayed rebound excitation lasting several hundred milliseconds, while others remained suppressed (Figure 1H), and this post-inhibition rebound response was related to the baseline firing rate (Figure S1). In a subpopulation of INs (20/44), CLA activation evoked a biphasic response (excitation–inhibition), whereas the remaining INs (24/44) were inhibited (Figures 1F, 1G, 1I, and 1J), suggesting the activation of inhibitory–inhibitory connections in the cortex. Interneuron excitation occurred with short latency (9.5 ± 0.5 ms, range 7–15 ms) and high fidelity (75% ± 5% of trials, range 16%–100%; Figure S1). Overall, IN modulation index (MI, see STAR Methods) values were significantly negative (−0.38 ± 0.08), as INs were inhibited following excitation (Figures 1I and 1J). INs located in deeper layers were more likely to be excited in accordance with the greater density of CLA axons in deeper layers (Figure S1). Optogenetic stimulation of the CLA during locomotion also reduced PC firing rates, though less than during rest (MIrest = −0.81 ± 0.03; MIrun = −0.55 ± 0.05; z = 3.7, p = 1.8 ×10−4, Figure 1K). CLA stimulation also evoked inhibition under anesthesia, or when using a small volume (30 nl) of AAV1-syn-ChR2, which labels all CLA neurons near the injection site irrespective of their projection target (Figure 1K). In control experiments where eYFP was expressed in the CLA without ChR2, no modulation of neural activity was observed (MI = −0.01 ± 0.02; Figure 1L). Therefore, since essentially all excitatory neurons were inhibited, all neurons (PCs and INs) in the PFC appear to be sensitive to CLA inputs through feedforward inhibition (FFI). PFC inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and medial dorsal thalamus (MD) also recruit cortical inhibitory circuits (Cruikshank et al., 2012Cruikshank S.J. Ahmed O.J. Stevens T.R. Patrick S.L.

To test whether these subcortical inputs to the PFC exert a similarly strong FFI suppression of cortical activity, we optogenetically activated BLA or MD neurons in vivo (Figures 1L and S2; see STAR Methods). We found that activation of these other pathways did not yield strong inhibition of PC neural activity. Instead, similar to previous reports (Dilgen et al., 2013Dilgen J. Tejeda H.A. O’Donnell P. Amygdala inputs drive feedforward inhibition in the medial prefrontal cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2013; 110: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Klavir et al., 2017Klavir O. Prigge M. Sarel A. Paz R. Yizhar O. Manipulating fear associations via optogenetic modulation of amygdala inputs to prefrontal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we found that activation of the BLA produced excitation in 29% (6/21) of PC recordings, while the other cells were inhibited or not modulated. Activation of MD resulted in excitation in 63% of PCs (36/57), despite the fact that MD inputs are known to evoke strong FFI in the PFC (Cruikshank et al., 2012Cruikshank S.J. Ahmed O.J. Stevens T.R. Patrick S.L. Gonzalez A.N. Elmaleh M. Connors B.W. Thalamic control of layer 1 circuits in prefrontal cortex.J.

The mediodorsal thalamus drives feedforward inhibition in the anterior cingulate cortex via parvalbumin interneurons.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 5743-5753Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The CLA produced significantly greater inhibition of PFC activity in awake mice (MI = −0.81 ± 0.03) and anesthetized mice or rats (MI = −0.61 ± 0.07) compared to the BLA (MI = −0.02 ± 0.10) and MD (MI = 0.19 ± 0.07) (Figures 1L and S2). The claustrocortical FFI also appears to be stronger than the direct GABAergic input from the globus pallidus (Saunders et al., 2015Saunders A. Oldenburg I.A. Berezovskii V.K. Johnson C.A. Kingery N.D. Elliott H.L. Xie T. Gerfen C.R. Sabatini B.L. A direct GABAergic output from the basal ganglia to frontal cortex.Nature. 2015; 521: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Therefore, compared to other major subcortical inputs, the CLA provides a uniquely strong form of FFI to the PFC. To study the circuit mechanisms underlying CLA inhibition of the cortex, we performed patch-clamp recordings from PCs and a diversity of molecularly defined INs while stimulating CLA–ChR2 fibers in acute slices from PV-Cre-TOM, SOM-Cre-TOM, VGAT-Cre-TOM, and NPY-hrGFP mice (Figures 2A and 2B ; see STAR Methods). CLA fiber activation produced short-latency excitatory currents in PCs, followed by larger inhibitory currents at a delay of 2.0 ± 0.2 ms; Figure 2C). The ratio between the size of excitatory currents (43 ± 20 pA) and inhibitory currents (226 ± 62 pA) ratio was strongly weighted in favor of inhibition (E/I ratio = 0.25 ± 0.07, n = 8). PCs showed strong inhibitory postsynaptic responses that were abolished by ionotropic glutamatergic antagonists, demonstrating CLA inputs evoke inhibitory potentials through local INs (Figure 2D). The excitatory CLA→PC synapses were depressing (adaptation ratio = 0.53 ± 0.17), as measured in response to 20 Hz stimulation (Figure 2E). To determine the cell-type-specific source of the inhibition, we surveyed somatostatin (SOM), fast-spiking parvalbumin (FS-PV), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) interneurons while activating CLA fibers (Figure 2F-L). SOM cells received very weak, nearly absent inputs during CLA fiber stimulation (0.65 ± 0.02 mV, and 3.3 ± 0.6 pA, n = 20; Figures 2F and 2J–2L). In contrast, fast-spiking FS-PV cells were strongly depolarized (10.5 ± 0.2 mV, n = 19), had large excitatory currents (108 ± 35pA), and were driven to spike in 37% of cells at a latency of 5.0 ± 2.5 ms (range, 4.4–15.4 ms) (Figures 2G and 2J–2L). Synaptic responses in PV neurons were also depressing in response to 20 Hz stimulation (adaptation ratio = 0.27 ± 0.05). Next, we used the NPY-hrGFP mouse line (Chittajallu et al., 2013Chittajallu R.

This basic categorization yielded 17/26 NPY cells, 11 of which had the classic NGF phenotype showing late spiking in response to “just past threshold” depolarization (Figures 2H and S3). These NPY-NGF cells were also strongly depolarized by CLA inputs (4.9 ± 1.1mV), had moderate-sized excitatory current (29 ± 6pA), had depressing responses to 20 Hz pulse trains (adaptation ratio = 0.27 ± 0.10), and showed CLA-evoked action potentials in 29% of cells at a latency of 9.8 ± 1.5ms (range, 6.7–15.6 ms) (Figures 2H and 2J–2L). We also sampled interneurons in the VGAT-Cre-TOM mouse (labeling all interneurons) to investigate the possibility that interneurons not specifically labeled in other experiments would be excited by CLA inputs. When we excluded clear FS cells (<0.2 ms spike width, peak firing rate >100 Hz), the magnitude of responses in these randomly sampled interneurons was small (EPSP = 0.96 ± 0.32 mV; EPSC = 7.3 ± 2.6 pA, n = 19) (Figures 2I–2L). Therefore, FS-PV and NPY cells were the two main classes of interneurons depolarized by CLA inputs. The latency to optical activation was shorter in NPY-NGF cells (4.5 ± 0.3 ms) and FS-PV cells (4.6 ± 0.2 ms) than in PCs (6.4 ± 0.7 ms) (Figure 2M), suggesting the postsynaptic AMPA receptor composition is different between INs and PCs as in the thalamocortical system (Cruikshank et al., 2007Cruikshank S.J.

Postsynaptic mechanisms govern the differential excitation of cortical neurons by thalamic inputs.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9127-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The smaller and slower kinetics of excitatory responses in PCs helps explain why they rarely fire action potentials in response to CLA activation in vivo, as their excitation would be quenched by the more rapidly acting inhibition. Collectively, these experiments show that two main types of interneurons—PV and NPY—are responsible for claustrocortical FFI. Interneurons containing NPY and PV are by and large non-overlapping cell types with distinct layer distributions in the PFC (Figure 3A). PV cells are mainly located in layer 5, while NPY cells are distributed throughout all cortical layers (Xu et al., 2010Xu X. Roby K.D. Callaway E.M. Immunochemical characterization of inhibitory mouse cortical neurons: three chemically distinct classes of inhibitory cells.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We compared the CLA-evoked disynaptic IPSP kinetics in PCs with FS→PC and NPY→PC kinetics to determine if one GABAergic subtype may be more responsible for CLA-controlled FFI (Figures 3B–3G). To begin with, the NPY→PC connection probability (16/34 pairs synaptically connected) was greater compared to FS-PV→PC (7/33 connected, Figure 3C), suggesting that NPY cells have a stronger influence on PCs (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang X. Shen S. Cadwell C.R. Berens P. Sinz F. Ecker A.S. Patel S. Tolias A.S. Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex.Science. 2015; 350: aac9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Moreover, NPY-NGF cells provide slow GABAA and GABAB-mediated inhibition in the cortex and have slower kinetics than fast GABAA receptors activated by FS-PV cells (Banks et al., 2000Banks M.I.

Identified sources and targets of slow inhibition in the neocortex.Science. 2003; 299: 1902-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We confirmed that FS→PC synapses have shorter IPSP rise times (5.6 ± 1.1 versus 22.3 ± 3.5 ms; p = 0.004) and decay half-widths (46.3 ± 10.6 versus 118.6 ± 21.9 ms, p = 0.008; Figures 3D–3F) than NPY→PC IPSPs. In many cases, the CLA-evoked IPSP kinetics in PCs matched those of the NPY→PC synapse (43%, 10/23), implying NPY cells were determining FFI in these cells (Figure 3E). In other cases, the CLA-evoked IPSP kinetics in PCs fit the dynamics of FS→PC synapses (35%). In the remainder of cases we observed a fast IPSP rise time with a slow decay suggesting co-innervation from both FS and NPY cells (22%, Figure 3F), and averaged across all cells the decay time of CLA mediated IPSPs (90 ± 12 ms) was better fit by the slower NPY–NGF inhibition. Finally, in vivo, the kinetics of spike suppression followed a time course more similar to NPY-PC IPSPs (Figure 3G), again suggesting the CLA-to-NPY interneuron circuit could play a special role in the strong inhibition seen in awake mice. To test the in vivo inhibitory drive from PV or NPY interneurons to PCs, we directly activated each interneuron type using ChR2 in PV-Cre and NPY-Cre mice and compared the dynamics of PC spike inhibition with CLA activation (Figures 3H–3L). Brief (1–5 ms) activation of PV or NPY neurons elicited powerful suppression of PC firing (Figures 3H and 3I). However, the spike inhibition recovery with PV activation was significantly faster (119 ± 5 ms) than with NPY activation (240 ± 19 ms, z = 4.64, p = 3.5 × 10−6) or CLA activation (244 ± 10 ms; z = 5.38, p = 7.8 × 10−8). The recovery from inhibition during CLA or NPY activation was not different (z = 0.02, p = 0.98; Figure 3J). Therefore, CLA-mediated inhibition cannot be explained by PV-mediated inhibition alone, and appears to be better correlated with the dynamics of NPY-mediated inhibition. In addition, NPY activation also potently suppressed FS firing in vivo (n = 5/5 cells; Figures 3K and 3L), confirming the presence of NPY-to-FS-mediated inhibition described previously in vitro (Jiang et al., 2015Jiang X. Shen S. Cadwell C.R. Berens P. Sinz F. Ecker A.S. Patel S. Tolias A.S. Principles of connectivity among morphologically defined cell types in adult neocortex.Science. 2015; 350: aac9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). To test the role of different interneuron subtypes in claustrocortical FFI in vivo, we activated the CLA using ChR2 while pharmacogenetically suppressing specific interneuron subclasses using the corresponding Cre mice with AAV5-CAG-FLEX-hM4D injected into the PFC (Figures 4A–4I). CLA modulation of PFC neurons was compared pre- and post-clozapine–N–oxide (CNO) administration, which induces hyperpolarization and reduces the probability of synaptic release in Cre-hM4D cells (Stachniak et al., 2014Stachniak T.J.

Roth B.L. Chemogenetic tools to interrogate brain functions.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2014; 37: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). As the claustrocortical projection is excitatory, we predicted that suppressing interneurons would reduce FFI and unmask claustrocortical excitation. First, the suppression of all GABAergic interneurons in VGAT-Cre-hM4D mice converted claustrocortical inhibition to excitation (MIpre, −0.55 ± 0.1; MIpost, 0.58 ± 0.08, z = 3.8, p = 1.5 × 10−4), demonstrating that the direct excitatory CLA inputs were sufficient to drive PC bursts in the cortex (Figures 4G and 4H and S4). Next, suppression of PV interneurons led to an overall reduction of FFI following CLA activation (MIpre, −0.65 ± 0.05; MIpost, −0.19 ± 0.04; z = 5.7, p = 9.39 × 10−9; Figures 4D and 4H). However, only 7% of the PC recordings showed short latency (5–30 ms) excitation following PV suppression, and robust inhibition was still observed (Figures 4G and 4H), suggesting PV interneurons are"

Although CPPs are widely studied as potential drug delivery tools, their role in normal cell physiology is poorly understood. Early during infection, the L2 capsid protein of human papillomaviruses binds retromer, a cytoplasmic trafficking factor required for delivery of the incoming non-enveloped virus into the retrograde transport pathway. Here, we show that the C terminus of HPV L2 proteins contains a conserved cationic CPP that drives passage of a segment of the L2 protein through the endosomal membrane into the cytoplasm, where it binds retromer, thereby sorting the virus into the retrograde pathway for transport to the trans-Golgi network. These experiments define the cell-autonomous biological role of a CPP in its natural context and reveal how a luminal viral protein engages an essential cytoplasmic entry factor."

Glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, dictates signal transduction between neurons. Upon its release from pre-synaptic terminals and diffusion across the synaptic cleft, glutamate binds to ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), which, in response, open their channels and allow the flow of cations into post-synaptic neurons (Kumar and Mayer, 2013Kumar J. Mayer M.L. Functional insights from glutamate receptor ion channel structures.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2013; 75: 313-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Traynelis et al., 2010Traynelis S.F.

The resulting iGluR-mediated depolarization propagates signaling in the post-synaptic neuron and is critical for normal CNS development and function. The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic-subtype iGluRs, or AMPA receptors (AMPARs), the most abundant and fastest-signaling iGluRs in the CNS, mediate the initial phase of post-synaptic depolarization (Bowie, 2008Bowie D.

AMPARs are tetrameric membrane proteins made up of a combination of GluA1–GluA4 subunits (Mayer, 2017Mayer M.L. The challenge of interpreting glutamate-receptor ion-channel structures.Biophys.

Structural mechanisms of gating in ionotropic glutamate receptors.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GluA2-containing AMPARs are typically mRNA edited at the Q/R site (Hume et al., 1991Hume R.I. Dingledine R. Heinemann S.F. Identification of a site in glutamate receptor subunits that controls calcium permeability.Science. 1991; 253: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar), which is at the tip of the re-entrant M2 pore loop. The edited GluA2 subunits (GluA2R) have arginines at the Q/R site that contribute their positive charge to the middle of the AMPAR channel pore, making it impermeable to divalent cations (Huettner, 2015Huettner J.E. Glutamate receptor pores.J. Physiol. 2015; 593: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Wollmuth, 2018Wollmuth L.P.

AMPARs composed of combinations of unedited GluA2Q and GluA1, GluA3, and GluA4 subunits, which all have Gln at the Q/R site, are permeable to divalent cations such as Ca2+. Neurons populated with Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) are predisposed to excitotoxicity and, as a result, are widely implicated in neurodegeneration (Henley and Wilkinson, 2016Henley J.M.

Given the role of CP-AMPARs in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, it is important to develop therapeutic agents that will target CP-AMPARs and not calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs), which are critical for normal CNS function. Unique to CP-AMPARs is inhibition by endogenous polyamines, such as spermine and spermidine (Bowie and Mayer, 1995Bowie D. Mayer M.L.

Because the majority of endogenous polyamines are localized intracellularly, their block becomes significant only at positive membrane potentials. Under physiological conditions, at negative membrane potentials, CP-AMPARs can be inhibited by extracellularly applied exogenous channel blockers, including polyamine- or acylpolyamine-containing toxins, such as the first-in-class argiopin also known as argiotoxin-636 (AgTx-636) (Antonov et al., 1987Antonov S.M.

We determine the molecular composition of the blocker binding site in AMPAR complexes and identify how different blocker moieties contribute to its inhibitory action and how the blockers can be trapped inside the ion channel. We expect that our findings, by showing precisely how channel blockers exert their function on CP-AMPARs, will catalyze structure-based design of blockers to specifically target CP-AMPARs for clinical treatment of neurological disorders. We recently established a GluA2Q construct (GluA2Q-STZ), where GluA2Q is fused to the transmembrane AMPAR-regulatory protein (TARP)-γ2 or stargazin (STZ), which positively modulates AMPAR activation, as a model for obtaining the structure of an activated, conducting state of a CP-AMPAR via cryo-EM (Twomey et al., 2017aTwomey E.C.

In addition, this fusion construct design is an excellent recombinant mimic of native AMPAR synaptic complexes (Twomey et al., 2016Twomey E.C. Yelshanskaya M.V. Grassucci R.A. Frank J.

We surmised that we could use this GluA2Q-STZ construct in the presence of CP-AMPAR blockers to provide insights into the structural bases of CP-AMPAR channel block. First, we tested the concentration and voltage dependence of channel block of GluA2Q and GluA2Q-STZ by IEM-1460, NASPM, and Agtx-636 electrophysiologically using patch-clamp recordings. In these experiments, we applied the agonist glutamate (Glu) alone or together with the blocker in the continuous presence of the positive allosteric regulator cyclothiazide (CTZ) to prevent AMPAR desensitization (Figures 1A and 1B ). Currents through both GluA2Q and GluA2Q-STZ were inhibited by IEM-1460, NASPM, and AgTx-636 in a concentration-dependent manner, with stronger inhibition observed at higher blocker concentrations (Figures 1C–1E). For the lowest-affinity blocker, IEM-1460, the potency of current inhibition for GluA2Q-STZ (IC50 = 3.54 ± 0.46 μM) was three times lower than for GluA2Q (IC50 = 1.15 ± 0.05 μM). This difference became smaller for the intermediate-affinity blocker NASPM (IC50 = 0.170 ± 0.016 μM for GluA2Q-STZ and IC50 = 0.0800 ± 0.0019 μM for GluA2Q) and slightly reverted for the highest-affinity blocker, AgTx-636 (IC50 = 11.5 ± 2.1 nM for GluA2Q-STZ and IC50 = 19.0 ± 3.5 nM for GluA2Q). Because both GluA2Q and GluA2Q-STZ represent CP-AMPARs, their control, non-blocked currents show strong inward rectification because of channel block by intracellular polyamines (Figure 1B). Therefore, to characterize channel block by the extracellularly applied blockers, the corresponding current amplitudes were normalized to the control current amplitudes. Current inhibition by extracellularly applied blockers was strongly voltage-dependent, became weaker at positive membrane potentials, and caused double rectification of the non-normalized currents (Figure 1B). The voltage dependencies of the normalized currents were well-fitted with the Boltzmann equation over the −60 to +80 mV range of membrane potential and were similar for GluA2Q and GluA2Q-STZ (Figures 1F–1H). The highest values of the fraction of the membrane electric field sensed by the blocker multiplied by its charge (zδ, 3.45 ± 0.16 for GluA2Q and 3.59 ± 0.22 for GluA2Q-STZ) were observed for NASPM (Figure 1G). Given the presence of three amino groups in the polyamine tail of NASPM, the high zδ values suggest nearly complete protonation of the tail under our experimental conditions. However, zδ values have to be interpreted with caution because the simplified Boltzmann model does not take into account that different positively charged groups of the blocker molecule can sense different fractions of the membrane electric field and that the field itself might change non-linearly along the ion channel pore (Sobolevsky et al., 2005Sobolevsky A.I. Yelshansky M.V. Wollmuth L.P. State-dependent changes in the electrostatic potential in the pore of a GluR channel.Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For example, the non-linearity of the field might be the reason why IEM-1460, which has a charge of z = +2 when completely protonated, shows zδ values larger than 2 (2.47 ± 0.16 for GluA2Q and 2.43 ± 0.12 for GluA2Q-STZ; Figure 1F). On the other hand, relatively low zδ values (2.05 ± 0.15 for GluA2Q and 1.93 ± 0.12 for GluA2Q-STZ; Figure 1H) for AgTx-636, which has many more groups available for protonation, might be a result of both incomplete protonation of these groups because of the local pore environment and substantially broader distribution of these groups in the membrane electric field because of the much longer tail of AgTx-636. Interestingly, and easily noticeable for NASPM, the extent of current inhibition at membrane potentials more negative than −60 mV can decrease with membrane hyperpolarization, possibly because of blocker permeation through the channel (Tikhonova et al., 2008Tikhonova T.B. Barygin O.I. Gmiro V.E. Tikhonov D.B. Magazanik L.G. Organic blockers escape from trapping in the AMPA receptor channels by leaking into the cytoplasm.Neuropharmacology. 2008; 54: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Overall, the concentration and voltage dependencies of current inhibition by the channel blockers IEM-1460, NASPM, and AgTx-636 were similar between GluA2Q and GluA2Q-STZ, indicating that the underlying mechanisms of channel block are conceptually the same. Nonetheless, we continued structural studies with GluA2Q-STZ because, structurally, we can capture this CP-AMPAR in the activated, conducting state with cryo-EM. To form a structural basis for channel block, we solved the structure of the GluA2Q-STZ complex in the activated, NASPM-blocked state (GluA2Q-STZNASPM; Figure 2) by preparing the sample in the presence of Glu, CTZ, and NASPM (STAR Methods). The overall 2-fold symmetric topology of GluA2Q-STZNASPM is very similar to the structure of the activated GluA2Q-STZ complex (GluA2Q-STZopen), with a three-layer arrangement of domains contributed to by the four subunits (A through D) of the tetrameric AMPAR (Figure 2B). The extracellular domain (ECD) is comprised of the amino-terminal domain (ATD) layer, which is necessary for receptor assembly, trafficking, and functional regulation and marks the top of the ECD, as well as the ligand-binding domain (LBD) layer, which sits below the ATD layer and harbors binding sites for the agonist and neurotransmitter Glu in eac"
https://openalex.org/W2887076119,"Purkinje cell dendrites convert excitatory climbing fiber input into signals that instruct plasticity and motor learning. Modulation of instructive signaling may increase the range in which learning is encoded, yet the mechanisms that allow for this are poorly understood. We found that optogenetic activation of molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) that inhibit Purkinje cells suppressed climbing-fiber-evoked dendritic Ca2+ spiking. Inhibitory suppression of Ca2+ spiking depended on the level of MLI activation and influenced the induction of associative synaptic plasticity, converting climbing-fiber-mediated potentiation of parallel fiber-evoked responses into depression. In awake mice, optogenetic activation of floccular climbing fibers in association with head rotation produced an adaptive increase in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). However, when climbing fibers were co-activated with MLIs, adaptation occurred in the opposite direction, decreasing the VOR. Thus, MLIs can direct a continuous spectrum of plasticity and learning through their influence on Purkinje cell dendritic Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2885609975,"Long-term depression (LTD) of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPA receptor)-mediated synaptic transmission has been proposed as a cellular substrate for learning and memory. Although activity-induced AMPA receptor endocytosis is believed to underlie LTD, it remains largely unclear whether LTD and AMPA receptor endocytosis at specific synapses are causally linked to learning and memory in vivo. Here we developed a new optogenetic tool, termed PhotonSABER, which enabled the temporal, spatial, and cell-type-specific control of AMPA receptor endocytosis at active synapses, while the basal synaptic properties and other forms of synaptic plasticity were unaffected. We found that fiberoptic illumination to Purkinje cells expressing PhotonSABER in vivo inhibited cerebellar motor learning during adaptation of the horizontal optokinetic response and vestibulo-ocular reflex, as well as synaptic AMPA receptor decrease in the flocculus. Our results demonstrate that LTD and AMPA receptor endocytosis at specific neuronal circuits were directly responsible for motor learning in vivo. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2885113599,"LINE-1 retrotransposition is tightly restricted by layers of regulatory control, with epigenetic pathways being the best characterized. Looking at post-transcriptional regulation, we now show that LINE-1 mRNA 3′ ends are pervasively uridylated in various human cellular models and in mouse testes. TUT4 and TUT7 uridyltransferases catalyze the modification and function in cooperation with the helicase/RNPase MOV10 to counteract the RNA chaperone activity of the L1-ORF1p retrotransposon protein. Uridylation potently restricts LINE-1 retrotransposition by a multilayer mechanism depending on differential subcellular localization of the uridyltransferases. We propose that uridine residues added by TUT7 in the cytoplasm inhibit initiation of reverse transcription of LINE-1 mRNAs once they are reimported to the nucleus, whereas uridylation by TUT4, which is enriched in cytoplasmic foci, destabilizes mRNAs. These results provide a model for the post-transcriptional restriction of LINE-1, revealing a key physiological role for TUT4/7-mediated uridylation in maintaining genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2885413541,"Emotions evoked by environmental cues are important for animal survival and life quality. However, neural circuits responsible for transforming sensory signals to aversive emotion and behavioral avoidance remain unclear. Here, we found that medial septum (MS) mediates aversion induced by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Ablation of glutamatergic or GABAergic MS neurons results in impaired or strengthened aversion, respectively. Optogenetic activation of the two cell types results in place avoidance and preference, respectively. Cell-type-specific screening reveals that glutamatergic MS projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) are responsible for the induction of aversion, which can be antagonized by GABAergic MS projections to LHb. Additionally, the sensory-induced place avoidance is facilitated by enhanced locomotion mediated by glutamatergic MS projections to the preoptic area. Thus, MS can transmit innately aversive signals via a bottom-up multimodal sensory pathway and produce concurrent emotional and motional effects, allowing animals to efficiently avoid unfavorable environments."
https://openalex.org/W2886671568,"Summary Mbd3, a member of nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) co-repressor complex, was previously identified as an inhibitor for deterministic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) reprogramming, where up to 100% of donor cells successfully complete the process. NuRD can assume multiple mutually exclusive conformations, and it remains unclear whether this deterministic phenotype can be attributed to a specific Mbd3/NuRD subcomplex. Moreover, since complete ablation of Mbd3 blocks somatic cell proliferation, we aimed to explore functionally relevant alternative ways to neutralize Mbd3-dependent NuRD activity. We identify Gatad2a, a NuRD-specific subunit, whose complete deletion specifically disrupts Mbd3/NuRD repressive activity on the pluripotency circuitry during iPSC differentiation and reprogramming without ablating somatic cell proliferation. Inhibition of Gatad2a facilitates deterministic murine iPSC reprogramming within 8 days. We validate a distinct molecular axis, Gatad2a-Chd4-Mbd3, within Mbd3/NuRD as being critical for blocking reestablishment of naive pluripotency and further highlight signaling-dependent and post-translational modifications of Mbd3/NuRD that influence its interactions and assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2885628225,"Cryptocurrency is a well-developed blockchain technology application that is currently a heated topic throughout the world. The public availability of transaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we present a dynamic network analysis of three representative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Namecoin. By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike most other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over time, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge repetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly basis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree distribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest connected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree distribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the famous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has different network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are heavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be treated as a small world. These network properties reflect the evolutionary characteristics and competitive power of these three cryptocurrencies and provide a foundation for future research."

Epithelial stem cells in hair follicles (HFs) have region-specific activity, which may arise from intrinsic cellular heterogeneity within mesenchymal dermal papilla (DP) cells. Here we show that expression of Hoxc genes is sufficient to reprogram mesenchymal DP cells and alter the regenerative potential of epithelial stem cells. Hoxc gene expression in adult skin dermis closely correlates with regional HF regeneration patterns. Disrupting the region-specific expression patterns of Hoxc genes, by either decreasing their epigenetic repression via Bmi1 loss or inducing ectopic interactions of the Hoxc locus with an active epigenetic region, leads to precocious HF regeneration. We further show that a single Hoxc gene is sufficient to activate dormant DP niches and promote regional HF regeneration through canonical Wnt signaling. Altogether, these results reveal that Hoxc genes bestow mesenchymal niches with tissue-level heterogeneity and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2800931289,"Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RARγ) are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore, we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RARγ expression, and determine RARγ regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RARγ levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RARγ cistrome, which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RARγ to regulate androgen signaling, RARγ knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RARγ downregulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RARγ expression and function. Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR-96 identified that RARγ and a number of RARγ interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RARγ target genes (e.g., SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p = 0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RARγ network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2885465214,"Neuromodulators are important regulators of synaptic transmission throughout the brain. At the presynaptic terminal, neuromodulation of calcium channels (CaVs) can affect transmission not only by changing neurotransmitter release probability, but also by shaping short-term plasticity (STP). Indeed, changes in STP are often considered a requirement for defining a presynaptic site of action. Nevertheless, some synapses exhibit non-canonical forms of neuromodulation, where release probability is altered without a corresponding change in STP. Here, we identify biophysical mechanisms whereby both canonical and non-canonical presynaptic neuromodulation can occur at the same synapse. At a subset of glutamatergic terminals in prefrontal cortex, GABAB and D1/D5 dopamine receptors suppress release probability with and without canonical increases in short-term facilitation by modulating different aspects of presynaptic CaV function. These findings establish a framework whereby signaling from multiple neuromodulators can converge on presynaptic CaVs to differentially tune release dynamics at the same synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2886006282,"The gate control theory proposes that Aβ mechanoreceptor inputs to spinal pain transmission T neurons are gated via feedforward inhibition, but it remains unclear how monosynaptic excitation is gated by disynaptic inhibitory inputs that arrive later. Here we report that Aβ-evoked, non-NMDAR-dependent EPSPs in T neurons are subthreshold, allowing time for inhibitory inputs to prevent action potential firing that requires slow-onset NMDAR activation. Potassium channel activities-including IA, whose sizes are established constitutively by PreprodynorphinCre-derived inhibitory neurons-either completely filter away Aβ inputs or make them subthreshold, thereby creating a permissive condition to achieve gate control. Capsaicin-activated nociceptor inputs reduce IA and sensitize the T neurons, allowing Aβ inputs to cause firing before inhibitory inputs arrive. Thus, distinct kinetics of glutamate receptors and electric filtering by potassium channels solve the timing problem underlying the gating by feedforward inhibition, and their modulation offers a way to bypass the gate control."

Across blocks of 15–42 trials, the base rate favoring left or right varied. Participants were not informed of the base rate or choice accuracy, yet they gradually biased their choices and thereby increased accuracy and confidence in their decisions. They achieved this by updating knowledge of base rate after each decision, using a counterfactual representation of confidence that simulates a neutral prior. The strategy is consistent with Bayesian updating of belief and suggests that humans represent both true confidence, which incorporates the evolving belief of the prior, and counterfactual confidence, which discounts the prior. Accurate decisions require knowledge of prior probabilities (e.g., prevalence or base rate), but it is unclear how prior probabilities are learned in the absence of a teacher. We hypothesized that humans could learn base rates from experience making decisions, even without feedback. Participants made difficult decisions about the direction of dynamic random dot motion.

The strategy is consistent with Bayesian updating of belief and suggests that humans represent both true confidence, which incorporates the evolving belief of the prior, and counterfactual confidence, which discounts the prior. Accurate decision making relies on both evidence bearing on the choice at hand and prior knowledge about the statistical regularities bearing on the possible options. In some instances, we learn these regularities through education (e.g., disease prevalence based on decisions of experts), but more often such knowledge is acquired over time through decisions we make ourselves. This poses a problem because without an omniscient teacher, our decisions can be inaccurate, which limits our ability to update our beliefs. The problem is compounded because the decisions we make may be affected by our evolving belief of the statistical regularities, thereby biasing our decisions, which could in turn affect how we update our belief about the regularities. As an example, consider you are working on a production line determining whether tomatoes arriving one at a time on a conveyor belt are ripe and ready to ship or unripe and need to be held back. Some are obviously red and ripe and others are clearly green and unripe, but there are others on the border that will be harder to judge. Each crate comes from a different supplier and will likely have a different proportion of unripe tomatoes. If you knew each crate’s proportion of unripe tomatoes (the base rate), it would help you sort the tomatoes. This is an example in which one is learning a prior (base rate) without a teacher or confirmation about ground truth. One possibility is that one would ignore the base rate in this setting, but that would be unwise when confronted with an ambiguous tomato. It makes more sense to estimate the base rate from one’s experience. One could simply use the proportion of decisions of unripe as the estimate of the base rate. However, this would give equal weighting to tomatoes judged as clearly unripe and those on the borderline. An alternative might be to use a measure of confidence in determining the base rate, but this invites another challenge. If one uses the base rate to decide ripeness, this will affect the tally and potentially bias the estimate of the base rate itself. This simple example illustrates the complexity of doing inference in a world in which one is simultaneously learning a model and applying it. It arises in medical decision making (Medin and Edelson, 1988Medin D.L. Edelson S.M. Problem structure and the use of base-rate information from experience.J. Exp. Psychol.

In these cases, the observations that inform the prior are clearly discernible (e.g., target reached/not reached) or are accompanied by explicit feedback. For example, if the sorter were to taste each tomato, the ground truth could be known, but there would be no tomatoes shipped. We hypothesized that in the absence of explicit feedback, decision confidence guides the acquisition of prior probability and does so in accordance with Bayesian updating. We build on recent progress in the understanding of confidence in simple perceptual decisions. To study the role of confidence in the acquisition of prior probability, we designed a task in which human participants made a sequence of binary decisions in the presence of a concealed base rate that favored one of the alternatives. The decisions involved judging the direction of motion of a set of randomly moving dots, which were made without feedback. The base rate was constant within a block of trials but randomly varied from one block to another. Crucially, the base rate was not known to the participant. As the participants made more decisions, the influence of base rate on choice and confidence increased, which was reflected both in the decision about the direction of motion and in an explicit report about the bias of the block. A bounded evidence accumulation model explained the decisions about motion by incorporating an estimate of the base rate in the accumulation. In turn, a probability distribution over base rates was updated based on the likelihood that the motion was rightward or leftward—what we term counterfactual posterior probability or counterfactual confidence—under the fictitious supposition that the alternatives were equally likely (cf. Bernardo, 1979Bernardo J.M. Reference posterior distributions for Bayesian inference.J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1979; 41: 113-147Google Scholar). The model predicted the dynamics of belief about the direction bias over the block. The findings expose a role for counterfactual confidence in belief updating, suggesting that the brain maintains probabilistic representations over decision hierarchies and timescales: direction over one trial and bias over many trials. Further, these probabilities are accessible for explicit reporting. Three participants were presented with a dynamic display of random dots of variable duration and had to decide whether the net direction of motion was rightward or leftward. Within a block of 15 to 42 trials, one direction of motion (left or right) was more likely, but which direction was more likely (and by how much) was unknown to the participant. The difficulty of the decision was controlled by three factors: strength of motion, stimulus duration, and bias strength (i.e., base rate). Motion strength was controlled by the probability (termed motion coherence [c]) that a dot is displaced in motion as opposed to randomly. Stimulus duration was sampled from a truncated exponential distribution (range: [0.1, 0.9] s). Bias strength was controlled by the probability that the motion direction would be rightward, termed B, which was selected randomly on each block from six possible values ranging from 0% to 100% in steps of 20%. Participants knew the possible values of B, and that they were equally likely, but were not told which one applied to the current block. Participants made three responses in each trial. They first reported the perceived direction of motion and the confidence that this decision was correct (Figure 1A, Choice and confidence report). They then reported whether they considered the block to have a right or left bias and the confidence in this judgment (Figure 1A, Belief report). To avoid confusion, we refer to this type of confidence as “belief,” an estimate of the probability that the block has a rightward bias (scale 0 to 1). Participants received no feedback about the accuracy of their decisions during a block of trials. Only after completing a block were they told which direction was the most probable, the strength of the bias in this direction (either 60%, 80%, or 100%), and the proportion of trials in which they responded correctly (Figure 1B). Figure 1C shows a typical sequence of events and reports that transpire in a single block in the experiment. The bottom two rows show the particular sequence of 22 trials, each associated with motion stimulus of some strength, direction, and duration. The upper two rows show the corresponding behavioral reports: direction choice, confidence in the choice, and belief about bias of the block. In this block, the participant was correct on most of the trials, with a confidence that was strongly correlated with motion strength. At the beginning of the block, the belief was in the region of high uncertainty (∼0.5) and evolved to greater certainty later in the block. As a glimpse into what we will appreciate in greater detail later, it can be seen that decisions made with high confidence are usually followed by larger changes in belief than decisions made with low confidence. This is evident for trials 9 to 14, which shows a sequence of low-confidence decisions accompanied by subtle changes in belief. The example provides an intuition for the inference problem the participant confronts on each short block of trials. We next describe the main effect of the base rate on the direction choices, the confidence in these choices and the belief that the block is biased to the left or right. We then develop a theory to explain the way the direction decisions inform belief and the way belief biases those choices. Finally, we use this theory to predict the time course (evolution) of this belief. We contrast this theory with alternatives. Throughout each block, choices were governed by the strength and direction of random dot motion. Figure 2A shows the proportion of rightward choices as a function of stimulus strength, combining data from all trials sharing the same base rate (color). When the base rate strongly favored rightward or leftward (1 or 0, respectively), nearly all of the choices were consistent with the base rate. At the intermediate base rates, the shift was less pronounced. To capture the effect in a model-free way, we performed logistic regression (solid curves) and estimated the choice bias (Equation 19, STAR Methods). As shown by the inset, the subjects clearly internalized the base rate during the block (Equation 19; p<10−8; likelihood ratio test; H0: all β3=0). That is, for the same motion strength, subjects were more likely to choose the direction consistent with the base rate of the block. We show combined data from all subjects (individual subjects are presented in Figure S1). It is clear from these observations that the subjects acquire knowledge about the base rate of the block despite the absence of feedback about whether their decisions were correct. Knowledge of the base rate should improve the performance on the direction task. This is clearly supported by Figure 2B, which shows accuracy as a function of motion strength (|c|), and groups base rates of similar strength. We adduce from these observations that participants incorporated knowledge of the base rate to bias and improve their decisions. Subjects furnished two additional reports—confidence and belief—which indicate that they formed an impression of the prior probability about direction over the course of a block. The confidence reports associated with each decision were clearly influenced by the base rate. Figure 2C shows the confidence ratings for correct choices split by the a priori probability that the direction of motion supports the choice that the participant made (correct choices only). For example, the a priori probability of 0.8 groups together right choices with rightward motion (positive coherence) in blocks with base rate of 0.8 and left choices with leftward motion (negative coherence) in blocks with base rate of 0.2. Two features of the confidence ratings stand out. The subjects were least confident when the motion was weak (coherence near zero; Equation 20; p<10−8, t test, H0:β1=0). Moreover, confidence was higher when the base rate was more informative (Equation 20; p<10−8, t test, H0:β2=0). This is important because it implies that subjects were not merely choosing one direction more often (e.g., out of habit) but that they incorporated knowledge of the base rate to reduce uncertainty in the decision. The second report was the belief that the base rate of the block favored right or left. This “belief” evolved gradually during the course of the block (Figure 2D). Note that the belief is not an estimate of the base rate, as one can be fully confident in a weak bias, but its evolution was more rapid on average when the base rate was more informative (Figure 2D, blue curves). We will attempt to explain the evolution of this bias by developing a theory of the two-way interaction between bias and choice—that is, the effect of bias on each decision and the effect of each decision on the estimate of the base rate of the block. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model in which subjects maintain a probability distribution over the base rate, p(B), within a block and use this knowledge to influence both their choice and their confidence within a trial. As we will see, the optimal way to update p(B) is to use a counterfactual form of confidence—the probability that a choice rendered on the evidence would be correct if the base rate were unbiased (i.e., B=0.5). We develop this idea in Figure 3 and provide a mathematical derivation in the STAR Methods. Figure 3A shows the hierarchy of causes that give rise to a sample of motion evidence, x. All trials are affected by the base rate, B, assigned to the block, and B itself is sampled from a uniform distribution. The bias in the block establishes the prior probability of direction of motion (d=sign(c), i.e., R or L) on each trial. The strength of motion (|c|) and the stimulus duration (T) are determined probabilistically for all trials (independent of block). The direction and strength of motion specify the stationary stochastic process comprising samples of evidence, x. We assume that x is a sample from a Gaussian distribution with mean = κcΔt and variance equal to the sample period (Δt). The parameter κ reflects the signal to noise of the evidence samples. To make a decision, the brain accumulates samples until either the accumulated evidence (e) reaches a threshold at ±A or the motion stimulus ends (Figure 3B). The time of this last sample is denoted te. If leftward and rightward motion are equally likely, the decision about direction should be determined by the sign of e, and the probability that the motion is rightward is determined by e and te (Kiani and Shadlen, 2009Kiani R. Shadlen M.N. Representation of confidence associated with a decision by neurons in the parietal cortex.Science. 2009; 324: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The heatmap (Figure 3B, right) shows the probability that the direction is rightward for all possible combinations of e and te: pu(R|e,te). The example trial (open circle) would have led to a rightward choice with probability 0.7 of being correct. The top half of the map thus provides a lookup table for confidence in a rightward choice. Leftward choices would arise when the evidence (e) is less than 0, and the probability that this choice is correct is 1 minus the values displayed—that is, the top half of the map reflected vertically across the horizontal green line. These statements about direction choice, probability of left/right and confidence apply only if leftward and rightward motion are equally probable—hence, the subscript, u (for unbiased), in pu(R|e,te). This condition does not occur in our experiment, but the mapping plays a role. We refer to the mapping on the right as a counterfactual posterior or counterfactual confidence. In the experiment, one direction within a block is always more likely than the other, and this affects the probability that the direction is right (or left) given {e,te}. For example, if the base rate, B, favors rightward, it might give rise to the map in Figure 3B (left). Notice that the decision criterion (dashed green line) dips to negative values of e. The mapping to confidence is altered as well. The same amount of evidence leading to a right choice (circle) now corresponds to 0.75 probability of being correct. The calculation supporting this map factors neatly into the expectation of the base rate multiplied by the counterfactual posterior—the probability that the direction would be rightward if the two directions were equally likely. The expectation of the base rate is informed by knowledge obtained on the previous trials in the block, represented by E(i−1)≡{e,te}1..i−1. In the example, the expectation of B is 0.57. The confidence is 0.57×0.7 divided by the sum of this term plus (1−0.57)×(1−0.7), where the last product is p(d=L|E(i−1))pu(L|e,te). The arithmetic yields approximately 0.75, which is also the posterior probability of right. Put simply, on the current trial, use the evidence, deliberation time, and the estimate of the base rate (from previous trials) to make the decision and assign its confidence. The remaining question is how knowledge of the base rate is updated. According to the hierarchical Bayesian model, the subject begins the block with a prior over the six possible base rates, p0(B). The true prior is uniform, but we allow for the possibility that subjects do not internalize this correctly. Figure 3C shows how these values are updated. As the graphical model (Figure 3A) makes clear, inference about B is arbitrated solely by the direction of motion, d. Key to the update is that the subject should not use the estimate of direction that they report but the probability of each direction under a neutral prior (B=0.5), in other words, the counterfactual posterior. This yields the update rule illustrated in Figure 3C, which depends on two components that change across trials: the posterior for rightward (and its complement for leftward) and the current estimate of the distribution of B. The use of the posterior can be visualized as a line (Figure 3C, center) that is then point-wise multiplied by the current p(B) (Figure 3C, right). The six probabilities are scaled to sum to unity (Figure 3C, left). Note that the updated distribution after one trial becomes the initial distribution for the next one (i.e., p(B|E(i))≡p(B|e,te,E(i−1))). Again, the full derivation of the expressions is in the STAR Methods. To appreciate why the Bayesian solution uses the counterfactual posterior to update p(B), consider the following example. Suppose that the participant has acquired a slight bias for rightward and is then presented with a sequence of stimuli of 0% coherence. The participant will tend to report rightward more often because the bias exerts a stronger influence when the evidence is weak. Therefore, if true posterior (confidence) is used to update the bias, the bias would tend to increase until the decision maker is certain that the block contains a rightward bias, even though the sensory evidence is ambiguous. As formalized by the expression in Figure 3C (and in the STAR Methods, Equations 6, 7, 8, and 9), the correct approach is to update the belief based on the likelihood that the evidence (e,te) had been obtained in a trial with right or left motion or, equivalently, the confidence that the subject would have under a neutral (i.e., uninformative) prior. In short, the counterfactual posterior circumvents the problem of a self-reinforcing prior, what might be thought of as double counting. This completes both parts of the theory: (1) how to incorporate one’s estimate of bias into the choice and confidence about direction and (2) how to update the estimate of bias (including the confidence in this estimate) based on this experience. Our main hypothesis is that participants modify their bias according to the counterfactual confidence they have in their decision. To test this hypothesis, we use the Bayesian model described in the previous section to fit each subject’s choices and confidence reports. We compared this model to two alternative models, one in which participants update their bias based only on the frequency of left and right choices (i.e., ignoring confidence) and another in which participants used confidence (instead of its counterfactual) to update the bias. After comparing the goodness of fit of the three models for the motion direction reports, we use the best-fitting model to predict—without additional degrees of freedom—the explicit reports of the belief that were not used in the model fitting. We used the sequence of stimuli (motion coherence and duration) on each trial to maximize the likelihood of the choice (left or right) and confidence (high or low) on each trial (see STAR Methods). The model constructs a hidden “latent” representation of the subject’s knowledge of the base rate, p(B), as it evolves with each trial. As shown in Figure 4A, subjects’ choice accuracy was explained by the Bayesian model. The points, which are identical to those in Figure 2B, combine data over the entire block, for both directions, and for all stimulus durations. The more informative the base rate, the more it can be relied upon to improve accuracy. The model quantitatively explains the degree to which the base rate was learned and incorporated by the participants (see Figure S3 for individual subjects). Figure 4B shows the same accuracy data but as a function of viewing duration for each motion strength. Here the data combine all base rates. Note that accuracy improves as a function of viewing duration for all informative (>0%) coherences (Equation 21; p<10−8, t test, H0:β2=0). This improvement is consistent with bounded accumulation of noisy evidence, where the bound curtails improvement at longer viewing durations, consistent with previous studies (Kiani et al., 2008Kiani R. Hanks T.D. Shadlen M.N. Bounded integration in parietal cortex underlies decisions even when viewing duration is dictated by the environment.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3017-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Zylberberg et al., 2012Zylberberg A. Barttfeld P. Sigman M. The construction of confidence in a perceptual decision.Front. Integr. Nuerosci. 2012; 6: 79Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These two graphs are informative cross sections of a rich dataset. Knowledge of the base rate, B, was acquired gradually during each block of trials. Figure 4C demonstrates the time course of the changes in choice accuracy. We used logistic regression to estimate the leverage of base rate on accuracy for each trial in a block (STAR Methods, Equation 21). The ordinate shows the leverage of B on accuracy after accounting for motion strength. It supports the model-free assertion that bias-dependent accuracy is learned over the course of the block (Equation 21; p<10−8, likelihood ratio test, H0: all β6=0), and it shows that this rate is consistent with expectations of the Bayesian model (gray shading). The model was also fit to explain the subject’s confidence in the direction report. For each subject, we tried to explain the probability that their confidence was high or low, relative to a criterion setting (see STAR Methods). The model produces an estimate of confidence that depends on the stimulus (strength and duration), the subject’s choice, and the model’s current estimate of the base rate (Figure 3C). It did not incorporate the subject’s belief reports. The lower row of Figure 4 shows the confidence fits in a way that parallels the accuracy analyses. The trial groupings are the same as in the corresponding accuracy plots (upper row), with one exception. The block base rate (Figure 4D) are expressed as the a priori probability that the direction of motion supports the choice that the participant made (correct choices only), as in Figure 2C. The model captures the important features of the data. Larger a priori probability of a correct choice increased confidence, and this effect was more apparent at the weaker motion strengths (Figure 4D). Confidence also varies as a function of stimulus motion strength and duration (Figure 4E). There is some mismatch with the model at 12.8% coherence (Figure 4D), especially for the 300–600 ms durations (Figure 4E). The effects build up gradually as a function of trial number in the block (Figure 4F), showing that this rate is consistent with expectations of the Bayesian model (gray shading). We compared the Bayesian model against two alternatives, which differ in the way knowledge of the base rates is updated across trials. As indicated in Figure 3C, a Bayesian observer will update her knowledge about the base rate after each trial using the expression,p(B|e,te,E(i−1))∝(Bνr+(1−B)νl)p(B|E(i−1))Equation 1 where νr=1−νl is equal to the counterfactual posterior for rightward motion, pu(R|e,te). In the first alternative, the participant updates p(B) based on the frequency of left and right choices, weighting all choices equally (i.e., ignoring confidence). This is implemented by making the evidence νr equal to 1 for right choices and 0 for left. We refer to this model as the Choice-only model. In the second alternative model, the evidence for updating the bias is the confidence that the participant reports in each trial rather than the counterfactual confidence that would have been reported under a neutral prior. To model this, we made νr equal to the confidence that the subjects report when they chose rightward, thus equal to p(R|e,te,E(i−1)), and to one minus confidence when subjects chose left. We refer to this model as the Choice-confidence model. As mentioned earlier, this model is suboptimal bec"

In vitro models of cellular senescence have proven to be very useful for the study of slow and progressive accumulation of damage resulting in the growth arrest of aging skin cells. In this study, we compared UVA-induced cellular responses in non-senescent (NS) vs. senescent (S) human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs). HDFs were irradiated with a single dose of UVA (7.5 J/cm2) and QuantSeq 3' mRNA sequencing was performed to assess differential gene expression. Both NS and S HDFs expressed similar numbers of differentially expressed genes, although distinct sets of genes were differentially expressed between the two groups. Higher expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway genes, such as TLR4, MyD88, and CXCL-8, was detected in S HDFs as compared with NS HDFs, and UVA exposure led to a downregulation of collagen genes, such as COL8A2 and COL5A3. Consistent with gene expression profiling, enhanced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion was observed in S HDFs compared with NS HDFs, in response to UVA. Furthermore, we show that TLR4-mediated ERK pathway is responsible for the UVA-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction as well as increased secretion of MMP-1 and IL-8 in S HDFs. Taken together, our results demonstrate the UVA-induced common and distinct molecular patterns of cellular responses between NS and S HDFs and suggest TLR4/ERK pathways as candidate targets to reduce senescent phenotypes."

Herein, we compared the effectiveness of humans eosinophils and eosinophil-depleted neutrophils to synthesize 15-LO metabolites using a cocktail of different 15-LO substrates as well as their sensitivities to eight documented 15-lipoxygenase inhibitors. The treatment of neutrophils and eosinophils with linoleic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonyl-ethanolamide, led to the synthesis of 13-HODE, 15-HETrE, 15-HETE, 15-HEPE, 14-HDHA/17-HDHA, and 15-hydroxy-AEA. Neutrophils and eosinophils also metabolized the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol into 15-HETE-glycerol, although this required 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol hydrolysis inhibition. Neutrophils and eosinophils differed in regard to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid and linoleic acid utilization with 15-HETrE/13-HODE ratios of 0.014 ± 0.0008 and 0.474 ± 0.114 for neutrophils and eosinophils respectively. 15-LO metabolite synthesis by neutrophils and eosinophils also differed in regard to their relative production of 17-HDHA and 14-HDHA.The synthesis of 15-LO metabolites by neutrophils was concentration-dependent and rapid, reaching a plateau after one minute. While investigating the biosynthetic routes involved, we found that eosinophil-depleted neutrophils express the 15-lipoxygenase-2 but not the 15-LO-1, in contrast to eosinophils which express the 15-LO-1 but not the 15-LO-2. Moreover, 15-LO metabolite synthesis by neutrophils was not inhibited by the 15-LO-1 inhibitors BLX769, BLX3887, and ML351. However, 15-LO product synthesis was partially inhibited by 100 μM NDGA. Altogether, our data indicate that the best 15-LO-1 inhibitors in eosinophils are BLX3887, BLX769, NDGA and ML351 and that the synthesis of 15-LO metabolites by neutrophils does not involve the 15-LO-1 nor the phosphorylation of 5-LO on Ser-663 but is rather the consequence of 15-LO-2 or another unidentified 15-LO."

https://openalex.org/W2885097514,"Researchers have long been interested in how social evaluations are made based upon first impressions of faces. It is also important to consider the level of agreement we see in such evaluations across raters and what this may tell us. Typically, high levels of inter-rater agreement for facial judgements are reported, but the measures used may be misleading. At present, studies commonly report Cronbach's α as a way to quantify agreement, although problematically, there are various issues with the use of this measure. Most importantly, because researchers treat raters as items, Cronbach's α is inflated by larger sample sizes even when agreement between raters is fixed. Here, we considered several alternative measures and investigated whether these better discriminate between traits that were predicted to show low (parental resemblance), intermediate (attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness), and high (age, gender) levels of agreement. Importantly, the level of inter-rater agreement has not previously been studied for many of these traits. In addition, we investigated whether familiar faces resulted in differing levels of agreement in comparison with unfamiliar faces. Our results suggest that alternative measures may prove more informative than Cronbach's α when determining how well raters agree in their judgements. Further, we found no apparent influence of familiarity on levels of agreement. Finally, we show that, like attractiveness, both trustworthiness and dominance show significant levels of private taste (personal or idiosyncratic rater perceptions), although shared taste (perceptions shared with other raters) explains similar levels of variance in people's perceptions. In conclusion, we recommend that researchers investigating social judgements of faces consider alternatives to Cronbach's α but should also be prepared to examine both the potential value and origin of private taste as these might prove informative."
https://openalex.org/W2885769946,"Background Since the tobacco epidemic is moving from developed to developing countries, it is important to understand trends in cigarette demand and supply. We focus on the African market since it offers the tobacco industry one of the best expansion potentials. Data A large variety of data from commercial (Canadean, Euromonitor International, tobacco industry reports), governmental (United Nations Comtrade, national statistics), and academic sources (Cigarette Citadels Map and journal articles) were utilized. Methods We compile data from multiple sources to study cigarette demand in Africa from 1990 to 2012. We then focus on cigarette production and international cigarette trade to detect structural changes in cigarette supply over the past few decades. We contrast data from these different sources. Results Cigarette demand and supply data in Africa is limited and is sometimes inconsistent across different sources. Given this caveat, we found that the overall demand for cigarettes (measured by sales) in the 22 countries covered by Canadean, which represents 80% of Africa’s population, increased by 44% (from 165.6 billion cigarettes to 238.5 billion cigarettes) from 1990 to 2012. This higher demand has been met by cigarette production increasing in these 22 countries by 106% during the same period. As a result, Africa has moved from being a net importer to a net exporter of cigarettes. At the same time, cigarette production has become more concentrated as the tobacco industry has strategically identified certain countries as production hubs. Conclusions Monitoring the production, consumption and trade of cigarettes by improving the quality of surveillance is necessary to understand the demand and supply of cigarettes not only in Africa, but globally."

We measured 36 morphological characters, 14 which are novel, in 3 regions on the corallum-the apex, branch and base-in order to quantify their relationship to site and depth. We found significant correlation between depth and 19 morphological characters, notably branch verruca area, branch verruca height, base verruca spacing, base spinule length, and branch corallite area. 60% of microstructural characters and 25% of macrostructural characters showed a correlative relation to depth, suggesting that depth acclimatization is manifested primarily at the microstructural level. Canonical discriminant analysis of all morphometric characters by depth supports clustering into 3 groups: an overlapping 7m and 15m group, a 23-30m group, and a 38-45m group. Canonical discriminant analysis by site supports clustering into low- and high-current sites, differentiated primarily by branch septa width, base septa width, pre-terminal branch width, terminal branch maximum length, and terminal branch minimum length. We conclude that distinctive patterns of morphological variation in mesophotic specimens of P. verrucosa could reflect the effects of abiotic parameters such as light and water flow. Elucidating the mechanisms behind the morphological changes that occur in response to environmental gradients can help clarify the role that physiological plasticity plays in the acclimatization of corals to the unique environmental settings of mesophotic coral ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2887706358,"Background and aims Adhesions, that form in 60–80% of all abdominal operations, can cause complications such as chronic abdominal pain, small-bowel obstruction, female infertility, and the need for adhesiolysis in future surgeries. Our 2010 Adhesion Awareness survey demonstrated that despite the huge clinical impact of adhesions; adhesion-related complications were seldom mentioned in the informed consent. Six years later, a follow-up survey was conducted to assess the progress on awareness on adhesion-related complications in the Netherlands. Material and methods The 2010 Adhesion Awareness survey was repeated after a literature update. The knowledge regarding adhesions; the use of anti-adhesive agents and involvement in the informed consent process were assessed. Surgeons and surgical trainees were contacted by e-mail. The data was analysed using a Chi-square or Mann-Whitney U test and corrected for multiple testing. Results The response rate was 32.6%, similar to the survey in 2010 (34.4%). 88.1% agreed with the clinical relevance of adhesions, comparable to 2010 (89.8%). The score on the knowledge test was 38.8% (2010: 37.2%). Involvement of adhesion-related complications in the informed consent process increased, although 32.5% almost never mentions adhesions. In 2016, 42.4% reported a correct occurrence of bowel lesions during adhesiolysis, higher than in 2010 (P<0.001). Conclusions The adhesion awareness did not increase in six years, despite the efforts made. However, an increased awareness regarding adhesiolysis related complications was detected. Improvement of knowledge and behavior is essential to narrowing the gap between the impact of adhesions as a major complication of abdominal surgery and the limited adhesion awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2886689814,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a negative impact on bone that is partly mediated by anti-citrullinated proteins antibodies (ACPA). These antibodies are associated with erosions, and with juxta-articular and systemic bone loss. Other RA autoantibodies, the anti-carbamylated protein antibodies (anti-CarPA), are independently associated with erosions. However, we do not know if they are also associated with juxta-articular and systemic bone loss. Here, we have addressed this question with data from 548 early arthritis (EA) patients. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH) and metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP). The 25.9% anti-CarPA positive patients did not show significant differences in BMD Z-scores with the negative patients. Nevertheless, this result was due to the similarity between negative and low-positive (below the median of the positive) patients, whereas the high-positive patients showed significant decrease of BMD at LS (β = -0.39, p = 0.01) and TH (β = -0.30, p = 0.02); but not at the juxta-articular bone of MCP. Given the overlap between anti-CarPA and ACPA, we included the two autoantibodies in an analysis that showed significantly lower BMD Z-scores at LS and TH (p< 0.01) only in the ACPA positive/anti-CarPA high-positive subgroup. However, the similar coefficients of regression between the ACPA positive/anti-CarPA high-positive and the ACPA negative/anti-CarPA high-positive subgroups (β = -0.50 vs. -0.52 at LS, and β = -0.37 vs. -0.30 at TH) suggested an independent association. Overall, these results support a contribution of anti-CarPA to systemic bone loss in EA patients."

Previous work indicated that NopM is an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for an optimal symbiosis between NGR234 and the host legume Lablab purpureus. Here, we continued to analyze the function of NopM. Recombinant NopM was biochemically characterized using an in vitro ubiquitination system with Arabidopsis thaliana proteins. In this assay, NopM forms unanchored polyubiquitin chains and possesses auto-ubiquitination activity. In a NopM variant lacking any lysine residues, auto-ubiquitination was not completely abolished, indicating noncanonical auto-ubiquitination of the protein. In addition, we could show intermolecular ubiquitin transfer from NopM to C338A (enzymatically inactive NopM form) in vitro. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis provided clues about NopM–NopM interactions at plasma membranes in planta. NopM, but not C338A, expressed in tobacco cells induced cell death, suggesting that E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of NopM induced effector-triggered immunity responses. Likewise, expression of NopM in Lotus japonicus caused reduced nodule formation, whereas expression of C338A showed no obvious effects on symbiosis. Further experiments indicated that serine residue 26 of NopM is phosphorylated in planta and that NopM can be phosphorylated in vitro by salicylic acid–induced protein kinase (NtSIPK), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of tobacco. Hence, NopM is a phosphorylated T3 effector that can interact with itself, with ubiquitin, and with MAPKs.

https://openalex.org/W2885537238,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the renal (pro)renin receptor (PRR) regulates expression of the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (α-ENaC). In this study we hypothesized that the renal PRR mediates high fat diet (HFD)-induced sodium retention and elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) by enhancing expression of the epithelial sodium channel (α-ENaC). In our study we used a recently developed inducible nephron specific PRR knockout mouse. Mice (n = 6 each group) were allocated to receive regular diet (RD, 12 kcal% fat) or a high-fat diet (HFD, 45 kcal% fat) for 10 weeks. Body weight (BW), SBP, urine volume (UV) and urine sodium (UNaV), as well as renal interstitial Angiotensin II (Ang II), and renal medullary expression of PRR, p-SGK-1, α-ENaC were monitored in RD and HFD mice with or without PRR knockout. At baseline, there were no significant differences in BW, BP, UV or UNaV between different animal groups. At the end of the study, HFD mice had significant increases in SBP, BW, and significant reductions in UV and UNaV. Compared to RD, HFD significantly increased mRNA and protein expression of PRR, α-ENaC, p-SGK-1, and Ang II. Compared to HFD alone, PRR knockout mice on HFD had reduced mRNA and protein expression of PRR, p-SGK-1, and α-ENaC, as well as increased UV, UNaV and significantly reduced SBP. RIF Ang II was significantly increased by HFD and did not change in response to PRR knockout. We conclude that obesity induced sodium retention and elevated SBP are mediated by the PRR-SGK-1- α-ENaC pathway independent of Ang II."

https://openalex.org/W2886212364,"Naturally-occurring chalcones and synthetic chalcone analogues have been demonstrated to have many biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-malarial, anti-fungal, and anti-oxidant/anti-cancerous activities. Compared to other chalcones, trans-chalcone exhibits superior inhibitory activity in cancer cell growth as shown via in vitro assays, and exerts anti-cancerous effects via the activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein. Thus, characterization of the specific mechanisms, by which trans-chalcone activates p53, can aid development of new chemotherapeutic drugs that can be used individually or synergistically with other drugs. In this report, we found that trans-chalcone modulates many p53 target genes, HSP40 being the most induced gene in the RNA-Seq data using trans-chalcone-treated cells. CRM1 is also inhibited by trans-chalcone, resulting in the accumulation of p53 and other tumor suppressor proteins in the nucleus. Similar effects were seen using trans-chalcone derivatives. Overall, trans-chalcone could provide a strong foundation for the development of chalcone-based anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2887936768,"A characteristic feature of plant cells is the ability to form callus from parenchyma cells in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli. Tissue culture propagation of recalcitrant plant species and genetic engineering for desired phenotypes typically depends on efficient in vitro callus generation. Callus formation is under genetic regulation, and consequently, a molecular understanding of this process underlies successful generation for propagation materials and/or introduction of genetic elements in experimental or industrial applications. Herein, we identified 11 genetic loci significantly associated with callus formation in Populus trichocarpa using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach. Eight of the 11 significant gene associations were consistent across biological replications, exceeding a chromosome-wide–log10 (p) = 4.46 [p = 3.47E−05] Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold. These eight genes were used as hub genes in a high-resolution co-expression network analysis to gain insight into the genome-wide basis of callus formation. A network of positively and negatively co-expressed genes, including several transcription factors, was identified. As proof-of-principle, a transient protoplast assay confirmed the negative regulation of a Chloroplast Nucleoid DNA-binding-related gene (Potri.018G014800) by the LEC2 transcription factor. Many of the candidate genes and co-expressed genes were 1) linked to cell division and cell cycling in plants and 2) showed homology to tumor and cancer-related genes in humans. The GWAS approach based on a high-resolution marker set, and the ability to manipulate targets genes in vitro, provided a catalog of high-confidence genes linked to callus formation that can serve as an important resource for successful manipulation of model and non-model plant species, and likewise, suggests a robust method of discovering common homologous functions across organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2885546072,"Background Soluble suppression of tumorogenicity 2 (sST2) has been shown to be of prognostic value in patients with chronic and acute left heart failure. The present study aims to assess the predictive value of sST2 levels in adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods In 169 consecutive patients with complex CHD and a mean age of 28.2 ± 12.0 years, sST2 levels were compared to 32 healthy controls and associated with clinical status as well as the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Mean follow-up time was 35.6 ± 24.9 months. Results In CHD patients, median sST2 levels were 29.7 ng/ml compared to 26.4 ng/ml in healthy controls (p = 0.007) and increased with different types of CHD and the severity of MACE. According to ROC analysis, the most important predictors of acute heart/Fontan failure were NYHA class III/IV (AUC 0.804, p<0.001, CI 0.668–0.941), NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.794, p<0.001, CI 0.640–0.948), γGT levels (AUC 0.793, p<0.001, CI 0.678–0.909) and sST2 levels (AUC 0.742, p = 0.004, CI 0.626–0.858), with NYHA class III/IV as the strongest independent predictor (p<0.001). All-cause mortality was best predicted by sST2 levels (AUC 0.890, p<0.001, CI 0.741–1.000), NT-proBNP levels (AUC 0.875, p = 0.001, CI 0.766–0.984) and NYHA class III/IV (AUC 0.837, p = 0.003, CI 0.655–1.000) with sST2 as the strongest independent predictor (p<0.001). Moreover, AUC increased to 0.918 combining both biomarkers and net reclassification improved with the addition of sST2. Conclusion In patients with complex CHD, sST2 may have additive value to natriuretic peptides for the prediction of all-cause mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2888158658,"Pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia 9 (ECTD-9) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by mutation of HOXC13 and is characterized by hypotrichosis and nail dystrophy in humans. Unlike patients with ECTD-9, Hoxc13-mutated mice and pigs do not faithfully recapitulate the phenotype of hypotrichosis, so there is a limited understanding of the molecular mechanism of Hoxc13-mediated hypotrichosis in animal models and clinically. Here, the homozygous Hoxc13-/- rabbits showed complete loss of hair on the head and dorsum, whereas hypotrichosis in the limbs and tail were determined in the Hoxc13-/- rabbits. In addition, reduced hair follicles (HFs) while the enlarged and increased number of sebaceous glands (SGs) were also found in the Hoxc13-/- rabbits, showing that the disrupted balance between HFs and SGs may respond to hypotrichosis of ECTD-9 in an animal model and clinically. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that Hoxc13-/- rabbits can be used as a model for human ECTD-9, especially to understand the pathologic mechanism of hypotrichosis. Moreover, the disrupted balance between HFs and SGs, especially in the Hoxc13-/- rabbits, can be used as an ideal animal model for dermatology ailments, such as acne and hypotrichosis, in preclinical studies.-Deng, J., Chen, M., Liu, Z., Song, Y., Sui, T., Lai, L., Li, Z.

https://openalex.org/W2886421044,"The number of selectable targets is one of the main factors that affect the performance of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Most existing code modulated visual evoked potential (c-VEP) based BCIs use a single pseudorandom binary sequence and its circularly shifting sequences to modulate different stimulus targets, making the number of selectable targets limited by the length of modulation codes. This paper proposes a novel paradigm for c-VEP BCIs, which divides the stimulus targets into four target groups and each group of targets are modulated by a unique pseudorandom binary code and its circularly shifting codes. Based on the paradigm, a four-group c-VEP BCI with a total of 64 stimulus targets was developed and eight subjects were recruited to participate in the BCI experiment. Based on the experimental data, the characteristics of the c-VEP BCI were explored by the analyses of auto- and cross-correlation, frequency spectrum, signal to noise ratio and correlation coefficient. On the basis, single-trial data with the length of one stimulus cycle were classified and the attended target was recognized. The averaged classification accuracy across subjects was 88.36% and the corresponding information transfer rate was as high as 184.6 bit/min. These results suggested that the c-VEP BCI paradigm is both feasible and effective, and provides a new solution for BCI study to substantially increase the number of available targets."
https://openalex.org/W2886481572,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication associated with diabetes mellitus with a pathogenesis that is incompletely understood. By regulating RNA silencing and post-transcriptional gene expression, microRNAs participate in various biological processes and human diseases. However, the relationship between microRNAs and the progress of diabetic peripheral neuropathy still lacks a thorough exploration. Here we used microarray microRNA and mRNA expression profiling to analyze the microRNAs and mRNAs which are aberrantly expressed in dorsal root ganglia from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. We found that 37 microRNAs and 1357 mRNAs were differentially expressed in comparison to non-diabetic samples. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that 399 gene ontology terms and 29 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were significantly enriched in diabetic rats. Additionally, a microRNA-gene network evaluation identified rno-miR-330-5p, rno-miR-17-1-3p and rno-miR-346 as important players for network regulation. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to confirm the microarray results. In conclusion, this study provides a systematic perspective of microRNA and mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia from diabetic rats, and suggests that dysregulated microRNAs and mRNAs may be important promotors of peripheral neuropathy. Our results may be the underlying framework of future studies regarding the effect of the aberrantly expressed genes on the pathophysiology of diabetic peripheral neuropathy."

The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the association of colorectal (CRC) molecular subtypes with response to targeted therapies in pre-clinical models and 2) to identify treatments for CRC stem-like subtype because these tumors are associated with a very poor patient prognosis. Eleven CRC cell lines were classified into molecular subtypes and tested for their response to pan-ERBB, MEK, and ERK inhibitors as single agents and in combination. All six inflammatory or TA cell lines were exquisitely sensitive to the combination of MEK and neratinib whereas all five stem-like cell lines were resistant. Growth inhibition in sensitive cell lines was greater with the combination than with either drug alone even in cell lines with KRAS mutations. The combination inhibited pERK in inflammatory cell lines but not in four out of five stem-like cell lines. MEK162 plus neratinib were synergistic in cell culture and xenograft models in inflammatory cell lines. The ERK inhibitor, SCH772984, down-regulated pERK, decreased cell viability, and was synergistic with neratinib in both inflammatory and stem-like subtypes. These results suggest that inhibition of pERK is a critical node in decreasing cell viability of stem-like CRC tumors. Our results also suggest that CRC molecular subtypes may yield predictive information and may help to identify patients who may respond to targeted inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2887420630,"Strychnos cocculoides fruit is an important food source for rural populations in Zimbabwe in times of scarcity. Its thick pulp tightly adheres to its seeds, causing pulp extraction constraints and waste during processing, leading to underutilisation. Therefore, pectinase maceration combined with heat treatments was studied to improve juice yield and juice quality. Metabolite profiling according to the heat map, FancyTile chromatic scale approach and phenolic compound content were used to compare the identified compounds. Prior to treatments, 16 known phenolic compounds, predominantly belonging to the phenolic acids, flavonoids and iridoid glucoside classes, were tentatively characterized for the first time in S. cocculoides using High Resolution Mass Spectrometry and LC/MS/MS. Overall, results showed that enzymatic treatments increased pulp yield (by 26%), physicochemical quality (38% increase in juice clarity), content of phenolic compounds (predominantly kaempferol, quercetin, caffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, iridoids) and antioxidant activity.The improved extraction of S. cocculoides pulp increases juice yield as well as juice quality by supplying larger amounts of phenolic compounds that have potential health benefits and act as dietary sources of antioxidants for the prevention of diseases caused by oxidative stress."

Using these diverse model systems allowed my colleagues and me to answer fundamental biological questions that enabled us to formulate far-reaching hypotheses and expanded our knowledge of human diseases caused by malfunctions in the metabolic processes involved. As you can see, I have a Spanish first name and German-Jewish last name. The origin of my name is rooted in simple history. My parents were born in Silesia, when it was part of Germany. My father was a judge, which at that time in Germany was an academic career, separate from becoming an attorney. My mother was among the first students to study social work, which then had a strong nursing component. In 1933, with Hitler's ascent to power, my father, along with other Jewish judges, was thrown out of the German court system. This was an unjust act, as Germany had agreed after World War I, because parts of Silesia had been in Poland, not to discriminate in any way toward minorities in that region until 1938. Legal action was taken, and someone appealed to an international court, claiming that minorities also included Jews, and surprisingly, Hitler abided by this. My father went back to work, but everyone knew that by 1938 this would end. Toward the end of that year, my parents moved to Berlin to prepare for their departure to Chile, where fortunately, my father's brother and his family had earlier immigrated. A few days after Kristallnacht (November 8, 1938), my father was detained and sent to a concentration camp. Although the stay was short, it was a life-changing experience for him. Fortunately, at that time, if one had an exit visa to leave Germany, one was freed from the camp and allowed to leave Germany. Thus, my parents and my sister left Germany for Chile in March 1939. A German judge could not really find an adequate job in Chile, so my father worked odd jobs as an accountant while my mother's nursing training helped the family survive. A few years later, I was born in a country which, as stated in its national anthem state, “is an asylum against oppression.” My parents were eking out a living when my father died in a skiing accident. My mother was left with my sister, age 16, and me, age 4. When the time came for me to attend kindergarten, I was sent to a Swiss school in Santiago where I stayed until graduating from high school. My mother thought that the discipline and languages offered at the school would be good for me. In addition to Spanish, we learned German, English, and French. These languages would be of great help to me when I worked on my Ph. D. degree because, as part of the requirements for the degree, we had to translate scientific papers from German and French into English. Did they help me later in my scientific career? Not really! In high school, I found humanities very easy, while sciences required more effort. In Chile, at that time, most university studies were free, but very competitive to get into. One first had to take a general exam, called “Bachillerato,” to attend a university, and then another exam to enter the specific school within the university you wanted to attend. I chose to study biochemistry because I did not like pure chemistry or pure biology. However, I did not even know what biochemistry really was! In Chile at that time, a student entered directly from high school into a professional school, with the risk that if you did not like the particular choice, you could not transfer to another school without starting from scratch. For the first 3 years working toward my professional degree as a “Biochemist,” the seven other students and I studied with students in the Chemistry and Pharmacy programs, while for the last 2 years, we studied in separate programs. One could not take a final exam in each course without a “pass,” an average C grade or 12 points. This scale was absolute with God receiving the top grade, 21 points, the professor, 18 points, and the rest of us mortals scoring between 12 and 18 points. Once you were allowed to take the final exam in a course, you could, of course, fail again. If you failed a course, you had one chance to retake the exam, and if you failed again or had more than one course without a pass for the final, you had to retake these courses again the next year and could not enroll in any subject for the following year curriculum. This was clearly a total waste of taxpayer money and contributed to the fact that only eight students, myself included, of the initial 100 finished the program in the minimum of 5 years! Unfortunately, the school wouldn't rank us, so our transcripts weren't particularly impressive. At that time, there were no graduate programs in sciences in Chile. For family reasons, I then enrolled at Rutgers in an MS program in Nutrition with a minor in Biochemistry. The graduate Biochemistry courses were easy compared with the courses I had in Chile. For my MS thesis, I worked on lipids of the avian brain with few interesting and publishable results. This experience taught me a life lesson about the importance of choosing a good thesis project and would serve me well as an advisor for my students. Thereafter, I entered the Ph. D. program in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the University of Illinois-Urbana. The department was then ranked as one of the highest in the country, and during the first year I took courses in physical chemistry, biophysical chemistry, and organic chemistry. The courses were so difficult for me that at times I thought I wouldn't survive and that I would have to return to Chile with a Master's degree, which I rationalized wouldn't be that bad. I distinctly remember thinking twice about whether or not to renew a subscription to a magazine as there was a good chance I would not be around to receive new issues! In the end, I did just fine. I hadn't taken into account that I would be graded on a curve. In one case, my organic chemistry professor gave back seven exams (one of which was mine) out of approximately ∼60, saying that there was no point in returning the rest of the exams! I looked at mine, and I had received a score of 4/20. I folded my exam and kept very quiet. Only much later did I find out, to my surprise, that the exams he had not returned had scored 0/20. As mentioned before, during my MS thesis at Rutgers, I had become interested in lipids and sought out Professor Herb Carter for my Ph. D. thesis. His area of research was the chemistry of sphingolipids, which are lipids containing the long-chain base sphingosine (Fig. 1). He was the head of the Chemistry Department (with 60 faculty members), and I was told that he wasn't taking any more students. After listening to the other faculty members' projects, I became rather discouraged and told one of the younger professors that I was thinking of perhaps leaving the department. He told me to talk to Herb again, and he was sure Herb would take me as a student. I prepared a long speech of why I wanted to work with him, and as soon as I saw him and started my reasoning, he told me, “Ok, I'll tell ‘so and so’ to give you a desk in my laboratory.” I had over-prepared my speech, but in retrospect, working in Herb's lab was one of the best decisions in my scientific career. My first project was to describe which sphingosine bases occurred in the beef kidney. GLC was one of the preferred methods to identify long-chain bases based on their relative mobility on GLC columns. One would also routinely reduce the long-chain bases' double bonds with hydrogen and palladium and analyze the corresponding changes in mobility on the GLC columns. After some routine analyses, I found that before and after catalytic hydrogenation it appeared that one peak still migrated in the position of C18 sphingosine, which, of course, has a double bond and should have been completely reduced to C18 sphinganine. At some point, I decided to do a control to see whether, in my hands, standard C18 sphingosine was completely reduced: alas it was! The only conclusion left was that the peak, which co-migrated with C18 sphingosine after catalytic hydrogenation, was not C18 sphingosine, but another long-chain base. This hypothesis lead to further analyses and the discovery of branched-chain long-chain bases in the kidney and to my first paper published in Biochemistry (1.Carter H.E. Hirschberg C.B. Phytosphingosines and branched sphingosines in kidney.Biochemistry. 1968; 7 (5660054): 2296-230010.1021/bi00846a036Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). I then had a pivotal conversation with Herb: he told me that I could either look for more of these long-chain bases in other tissues or pursue something totally different. It was my choice, and I chose to pursue something different. I never forgot this conversation because there is always a dilemma of where to go next in research, especially after making a new discovery. While I was engaged in my Ph. D. research and contemplating my future research, Herb became Vice Chancellor for academic affairs at Urbana and George Schroepfer kindly allowed me to transfer to his group to work on my own project. I thought that figuring out the in vitro mechanism by which the double bond in sphingosine arose, which was unknown at that time, would be a nice and important project. After many months of trying everything I could think of and getting nowhere, I was desperate. In my desperation, I did a somewhat irrational experiment, where I added ATP to a reaction mixture with tritiated sphinganine (a saturated sphingosine base) on the assumption that energy might be required for the double bond formation. It was not, but I noticed that the radiolabel became soluble in the aqueous layer of a water/chloroform/methanol mixture and not as sphinganine in chloroform/methanol. This led to the discovery of a crude sphinganine kinase, a Journal of Biological Chemistry paper, and the conclusion of my Ph. D. thesis (2.Hirschberg C.B. Kisic A. Schroepfer G.J. Enzymatic formation of dihydrosphingosine l-phosphate.J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245 (5432798): 3084-3090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With these results, I got the courage to tell Herb Carter and George Schroepfer that I wanted to go to Gene Kennedy's lab at Harvard Medical School to work as a postdoc on phospholipids. Fortunately for me, they were supportive, and after an interview with Gene, I was accepted in his lab, provided I could get a fellowship. I was in the U. S. on a student visa and could not apply to NIH or NSF for fellowships. I ended up looking at small foundations that would allow foreigners to apply. I discovered the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research and applied, having no idea that it was rather prestigious! I was asked for a final interview to visit Charles Huggins in Chicago. Huggins was on the Board of the Fund and had received the Nobel Prize for his work on prostate cancer. I did not know this and George Schroepfer later told me he did not want to scare me, but Huggins had a reputation of intimidating scientists, both young and old. The interview took place in Huggins' lab: he was standing on one side of a lab bench, and I was sitting on a lab stool on the other side. He asked his first question: What is science? Without waiting for an answer, he asked the second question: What is research? At some point, during one of my answers, I said that I sometimes got emotional about my lab work. He stopped me and asked me sternly: “You get emotional about your lab work?” I started to backtrack and clarified by saying yes, but that I was also aware that this could have some limitations. He then asked whether I had met Gene Kennedy. I answered yes, and Huggins started his elegy about Kennedy and at the end said that Gene also gets emotional about his work! Lucky me, I had said the right words! I left the interview exhausted but got the fellowship, which ended up being more than generous (more about this later). Gene Kennedy's lab was small, around seven people. While there, I made lifelong friends with Bill Dowhan (who has made very important and novel contributions to the role of phospholipids in membranes and wrote a Reflections article in this journal recently), Chris Raetz (whose untimely passing was tragic and whose friendship is thoroughly missed), Bill Wickner (a world expert in protein translocation across membranes), and toward the end of my stay, Jim Rothman (who received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine). During those times, postdoctoral fellowships lasted for 2 years. At the end of my first year as a postdoctoral fellow, I had accomplished absolutely nothing. My project was to purify Escherichia coli cardiolipin synthase using a radiolabeling activity assay with CDP-diglyceride and radiolabeled phosphatidylglycerol. This was then thought to be the pathway for biosynthesis of cardiolipin (Fig. 2). I was unable to solubilize the enzyme and do assays while the enzyme remained active. I felt Gene thought my lack of ability was the cause for the slow progress of the project. Having once seen a full list of the postdocs who had been in his lab, half of which we had never heard of, I feared that I was destined to join them, and I was pretty discouraged. Fortunately, Gene let me test an alternative hypothesis, namely that cardiolipin was synthesized by the condensation of two phosphatidylglycerols, yielding cardiolipin and free glycerol. I would have done this on my own, but I could not order radioactive substrates without Gene knowing. I synthesized tritiated phosphatidyl glycerol and [32P]CDP-diglyceride, showed that the latter was not a substrate, and showed that both free glycerol and cardiolipin were reaction products. It turns out that Joan Lusk in Gene Kennedy's lab had previously obtained in vivo evidence supporting this pathway: she had found that, upon feeding radiolabeled glycerol to E. coli, some of the starting product was converted to phosphatidylglycerol, and after a lag, additional free glycerol and cardiolipin appeared within the cell, consistent with the in vitro pathway we had described. Fortunately for me, Gene decided to publish our results in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. (PNAS) (3.Hirschberg C.B. Kennedy E.P. Mechanism of enzymatic synthesis of cardiolipin in Escherichia coli.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69 (4551982): 648-65110.1073/pnas.69.3.648Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). At that time, if a National Academy member (Gene) wanted to publish in PNAS, there was no further required review of the manuscript! While in Boston, I spent some of my time outside of lab attending many, somewhat esoteric, classical music concerts. During one such concert at the Old West Church in Boston, which celebrated the 300-year anniversary of Heinrich Schütz's death, I met a wonderful woman. Her name was Lois. She later became my wife, and we have been married ever since. I decided to do a second, 2-year postdoc in Phil Robbins' lab at MIT. I applied for a 1-year extension of my Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research Fellowship and was advised by the director that while this was not unprecedented, I had to convince the Board of Scientific Advisors that I deserved this extra year more than new applicants who had never had a fellowship. I still wince at this, but as luck would have it, I had an ally in Joan Lusk. Joan, as mentioned previously, had been a former student in Kennedy's lab and had moved on to a postdoc position in Salvador (Salva for short) Luria's lab at MIT. Luria happened to be on the Board of the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research, and Joan had told him about our cardiolipin synthase results. I was able to get a third year of funding! During my stay in Phil Robbins' lab at MIT, I studied the relation of lipids of Sindbis virus, and those of the host cell plasma membrane, and found them to be very similar (4.Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. The glycolipids and phospholipids of Sindbis virus and their relation to the lipids of the host cell.Virology. 1974; 61 (4472788): 602-60810.1016/0042-6822(74)90295-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The major emphasis of Phil's labs was glycosylation of proteins, and my stay made two major long-term impacts on my life: I decided to work on glycosylation in my future, independent scientific career, and I developed a lifelong friendship and professional relationship with Phil, which lasted up to our retirement. In 1973, there were few academic job openings. I started to worry whether Gene was recommending me for these positions and whether I would be able to obtain one of them. Fortunately, his secretary, Phyllis Elfman, who really ran Gene's lab, told me that Gene wasn't getting many letters looking for job applicants. Eventually, there was an opening in the Biochemistry Department at St. Louis University School of Medicine, and when Bob Olson, the Chairman, asked Gene for a letter of recommendation, Gene called him by phone. This made an enormous difference, as it got me an interview. I later heard that for three job openings, they got 400 applications! I got the job, but before leaving MIT, I received a phone call from Salva Luria. My blood pressure immediately went up! I had received money, for what amounted to approximately half an NIH grant, from the Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research to start up my independent laboratory. Salva wanted to know whether I would return the unspent money to the Fund if I received an NIH grant during the first year. With this money and the startup money from St. Louis University, I was in good shape for some time, so I was happy to tell Salva “yes.” It's easy to be generous if you have money! At St. Louis University, I was fortunate enough to get two 3-year RO1 grants within a short period of time: one on glycosylation and one on sphingolipids. The former grant would last for over 30 years without interruption, while I let the latter expire after 6 years! I then started a second grant on sulfation and phosphorylation of sugars in secreted proteins such as casein, which lasted 20 years without interruption. My first grant on glycosylation was focused on the existence of cell-surface glycosyltransferases. Saul Roseman had postulated that cell-surface glycosyltransferases, in conjunction with extracellular nucleotide sugars, led to glycoconjugates being synthesized on cell surfaces, where they were enriched in the cell and thought to play important roles in cell–cell interactions. While at MIT, my lab bench had been behind Bart Sefton, who was also a postdoc and who knew a lot about cell biology and cells in tissue culture. Bart always mentioned to me that removing cells that had been grown in tissue culture from a monolayer for biochemical experiments most likely caused severe injury to these cells, if not death. If broken or dying cells were incubated with nucleotide sugar, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to do experiments with cultured cells, where one could ascribe glycosylation to the cell surface, and not to other internal organelles. Most, if not all, cell-surface glycosylation studies at the time had removed cells grown in monolayer with trypsin, EDTA, or even scraping. We determined that under all these conditions of cell removal followed by mock incubations, the great majority of cells had most likely died as they would not re-adhere to tissue culture plates and grow. The control consisted of removing cells from the monolayer with trypsin and resuspending in tissue culture medium with serum, in which case ∼80% of cells adhered to the plates and grew. So, clearly one could not remove cells from monolayers for the experiments we wanted to do. When we incubated cells grown in monolayers with nucleotide sugars, in the presence of incubation buffers, we found that virtually all nucleotide sugars were degraded, and free radioactive sugar was found in the incubation medium. A small amount of radioactive sugar was covalently bound to cell surfaces, but a large amount of soluble radioactive sugar was within the cells. Thus, we could not rule out that free sugar, from nucleotide sugars, was entering cells, subsequently being converted to nucleotide sugars, and then acting as donors to glycans within cells in reactions catalyzed by glycosyltransferases within cells. C. P. Leblond and his group had recently obtained electron microscopic–autoradiographic evidence for this internal (in the Golgi apparatus) glycosylation. The problem for us was that many of the leading laboratories in glycosylation were publishing papers in top journals on the existence of cell-surface glycosyltransferases. We were newcomers to the field! Fortunately for us, Ed Heath (then chair of the Biochemistry Department at the University of Iowa) came to the department to give a seminar, and when I showed him our results, he gave me two important pieces of advice. Ed had been a postdoc in Saul Roseman's laboratory. He told me that if Saul isn't working on this anymore, it means he is skeptical about the whole theory. In addition, he suggested we not say that surface glycosyltransferases do not exist, but instead say the current evidence does not support the hypothesis. With this advice, we submitted a paper to Biochemistry (5.Hirschberg C.B. Goodman S.R. Green C. Sialic acid uptake by fibroblasts.Biochemistry. 1976; 15 (821521): 3591-359910.1021/bi00661a029Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One reviewer thought it was fine, the second stated that so many papers could not be wrong and recommended rejection, and fortunately, the final referee recommended publication! With this I was able to renew my RO1 grant. Soon after that, I unexpectedly got a phone call from Saul Roseman. I had seen Saul tear a speaker (who later became a National Academy of Sciences member) to shreds at a FASEB meeting in Atlantic City by asking him to summarize the theory of Arrhenius plots, which many, at the time, were using to study lipid membrane fluidity! The first thing Saul said to me over the phone was that he did not want to discuss cell integrity, but “your results contradict your own hypothesis,” he said. “How?” I asked, and he reiterated the finding that we had found some radiolabeled sugar covalently attached to cell surfaces, which he suggested supported his theory. When I replied that this was most likely due to the free sugars within cells, which had been converted to nucleotide sugars within cells, making them substrates for internal glycosylation, he told me to forget about the soluble radioactivity within cells. My answer was that I wanted to be quantitative and to do so we had to take this into account. Obviously, he was testing me and we later became good friends! According to my Chair, he even wrote me a positive letter of recommendation for my promotion to Associate Professor with tenure! In the early 1970s, thanks to the pioneering studies by George Palade, Günter Blobel, and David Sabatini, it was established that membrane and secreted proteins were synthesized on membrane-bound polysomes, were then translocated into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, and thereafter, migrate via vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. From there they go to the plasma membrane or are secreted. It is in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum where many proteins are initially glycosylated by sugars, covalently linked to the lipid dolichol. Through the work of C. P. Leblond's group and others, it had also been shown that in the Golgi apparatus lumen, many additional sugars are added to these proteins, not by dolichol, but instead directly by nucleotide sugars (Fig. 3). The latter are synthesized in the cytosol and must, therefore, reach the lumen of the Golgi apparatus by what was then an unknown mechanism. We postulated that there were transporters for these nucleotide derivatives in the Golgi apparatus membrane. Together with David J. Carey, we decided to test whether we could demonstrate in vitro transport of nucleotide sugars into Golgi vesicles from rat liver. Before such experiments could be done, we had to demonstrate that the vesicles we used were sealed and of the same in vivo membrane topography Fortunately, we were able to prove both points. The first substrate we tested was CMP-sialic acid, and we compared the behavior of this nucleotide sugar with that of standard “penetrators” such as deoxyglucose, which enters the Golgi apparatus passively, and that of nonpenetrators such as inulin. We observed that radioactivity from CMP-[3H]sialic acid entered the lumen of the vesicles at a much faster rate than deoxyglucose and free sialic acid. Additional results also further supported our hypothesis: CMP-sialic acid did not enter vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum, transport was saturable with a Km in the 1–2 μm range, and when we mixed commercially available CMP-[3H]sialic acid with [14C]CMP-sialic acid, synthesized in the lab, the entire molecule appeared to enter as a unit. We submitted this evidence to Cell (6.Carey D.J. Sommers L.W. Hirschberg C.B. CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid: isolation from and penetration into mouse liver microsomes.Cell. 1980; 19 (7363326): 597-60510.1016/S0092-8674(80)80036-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), where it was accepted. We were still worried about adsorption of nucleotide sugars to vesicles, rather than transport into vesicles, although the evidence argued strongly against adsorption. While no reviewer of subsequent papers brought this up, it eventually came up during a seminar I gave at Merck. During the seminar, Chris Raetz (who was at Merck at that time), my good friend from Gene Kennedy's lab, promptly raised the question of adsorption. By then, Juan Capasso, in our lab, in collaboration with Tom Keenan, had demonstrated transport of ATP into the Golgi apparatus, of rat mammary glands and showed that although 4,4′-diisothiocyano-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS) (a stilbene derivative and anion transport inhibitor) inhibited transport of ATP, it did not inhibit transfer of phosphate from ATP onto endogenous luminal Golgi acceptors such as casein. On the other hand, EDTA, which inhibited transfer of phosphate from ATP to casein and did not enter Golgi vesicles, did not inhibit transport of ATP onto the lumen of Golgi vesicles and subsequent transfer to casein. This was unequivocal proof that transport of ATP into the Golgi lumen was followed by transfer of phosphate to lumenal casein, and by extrapolation, that transfer of nucleotide sugars was followed by transfer of sugars to endogenous protein and lipid acceptors (7.Capasso J.M. Keenan T.W. Abeijon C. Hirschberg C.B. Mechanism of phosphorylation in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus: translocation of adenosine 5′-triphosphate into Golgi vesicles from rat liver and mammary glands.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2925690): 5233-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Luigi Puglielli, in my lab, later purified this transporter to homogeneity. Subsequently Caroline Clairmont, also in my lab, demonstrated transport of ATP into the endoplasmic reticulum and Eduardo Guillen partially purified this transporter. Transport of nucleotide sugars such UDP-glucose and UDP-GlcNAc into the endoplasmic reticulum of rats was shown by Mary Perez (8.Hirschberg C.B. Robbins P.W. Abeijon C. Transport of nucleotide sugars, ATP and nucleotide sulfate in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759482): 49-6910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.49Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In earlier in vitro nucleotide sugar transport studies, we had measured the internal volume within vesicles and concluded that nucleotide sugars were concentrated within the lumen of the vesicles 10–30–fold, compared with their concentration in the reaction medium. If this was correct, then energy would be required, but we knew that the assay did not require ATP or another energy source in the reaction medium. The fact that several ionophores had no effect on transport led us to hypothesize that an antiport mechanism was responsible for the uphill transport of nucleotide sugars into the Golgi lumen. Together with Juan Capasso (9.Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of RAI-avid mLN on post I-131 ablation SPECT/CT and the risk factors related to metastasis among patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in the low- or intermediate-risk groups.Among 339 patients with PTC who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 ablation, 292 (228 women, 64 men) belonging to the low- or intermediate-risk groups before I-131 ablation, and with sufficient clinical follow-up data were enrolled. The risk groups were classified based on the American Thyroid Association 2015 guideline. Each patient was followed-up for at least 24 months after the ablation (median: 30 months). The clinical, pathologic, and biochemical factors of PTC were reviewed, and their relationships to RAI-avid mLN on SPECT/CT were analyzed.Of the 292 patients, 61 and 231 belonged to the low-and intermediate-risk groups, respectively. Four (6.5%) patients in the low-risk group and 31 (13.0%) patients in the intermediate-risk group had RAI-avid mLN. A high preablation TSH-stimulated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) level in the low- or intermediate-risk group predicted the presence of RAI-avid mLN (cut-off = 0.5; hazard ratio (HR): 2.96; p = 0.04). In the subgroup analysis by risk group, TSH-stimulated serum Tg only predicted RAI-avid mLN in the low-risk group (cut-off = 1.0; HR: 5.3; p = 0.03).The incidence of RAI-avid mLN on postablation SPECT/CT was relatively high in both low- and intermediate-risk patients with PTC, and high preablation TSH-stimulated serum Tg level was a predictor of metastasis, especially in the low-risk group. A selective treatment approach should be considered in patients with high preablation TSH-stimulated serum Tg level."

A total 316 patients underwent ultrasonography (US)-guided FNA with BRAFV600E mutation analysis to diagnose thyroid nodules. One hundred sixteen patients with insufficient US images (n = 6), follow-up loss (n = 43), or unknown final diagnosis (n = 67) were excluded from the study. Comparisons between US diagnoses, cytological diagnoses, and BRAF mutation analysis were performed. Of 200 thyroid nodules, there was US diagnosis with 1 false negative and 11 false positive cases, cytological diagnosis with 10 false negative and 2 false positive cases, and BRAFV600E mutation analysis with 19 false negative and 2 false positive cases. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of BRAFV600E mutation analysis were 83.2%, 98.1%, 97.5%, 86.6%, and 91%, respectively. Of the 18 nodules with Bethesda category III, 9 were true positive, 6 were true negative, 3 was a false negative, and none were false positive on BRAF mutation analysis. In conclusion, we recommend that BRAFV600E mutation analysis only be performed for evaluating thyroid nodules with Bethesda category III, regardless of US diagnosis."

To study its dynamics, we build a reverse kinematics model. We analyze the motion and the force for each component of the new support with a simulation in Matlab/Simulink. The results show that it has appropriate structures with the required four-bar linkages. To compare the performance between the new slipper-type support and the traditional support, we design their mechanics models, deduce their mechanics relations and obtain the force curves for each component of both supports under the same loads. The results prove that the new slipper-type support has less demand on oil pressure for the hydraulic cylinder when working at middle and high positions and it has a larger supporting force and a higher supporting stability which would be more energy-efficient."
https://openalex.org/W2887611464,"An integrated model assessing the status and productivity of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, hereafter krill) was configured to estimate different subsets of 118 potentially estimable parameters in alternative configurations. We fixed the parameters that were not estimated in any given configuration at pre-specified values. The model was fitted to over forty years of fisheries and survey data for krill in Subarea 48.1, a statistical reporting area around the Antarctic Peninsula used by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The number of estimated parameters was gradually increased across model configurations. Configurations that estimated more parameters fitted the data better, but the order in which the parameters were estimated became more important in finding the best fit. Twenty-two configurations estimating from 48 to 107 parameters were able to obtain an invertible Hessian matrix that was subsequently used to estimate parameter uncertainty. Parameter uncertainties calculated using asymptotic approximation around the maximum likelihood estimates were often larger than uncertainties based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for the same parameters. Diagnostics applied to MCMC samples in the best model of each configuration that obtained an invertible Hessian indicated that the most highly parameterized configurations did not reach stationary distributions. A 96-parameter configuration was the best fitting model of those that passed the MCMC diagnostics. The ΔAIC and ΔBIC scores indicated essentially no support relative to the best model for the alternative models that also passed MCMC diagnostics. Simulated data using the configurations as operating models showed that while all configurations passed ""self-tests"" for spawning biomass and recruitment, there was a small negative bias due to model penalties in the fishing mortality estimates for years with the highest fishing mortalities. ""Cross-tests"" of configurations that estimated different parameters often differed from the operating model values."
https://openalex.org/W2885055556,"Spines, or modified hairs, have evolved multiple times in mammals, particularly in rodents. In this study, we investigated the evolution of spines in six rodent families. We first measured and compared the morphology and physical properties of hairs between paired spiny and non-spiny sister lineages. We found two distinct hair morphologies had evolved repeatedly in spiny rodents: hairs with a grooved cross-section and a second near cylindrical form. Compared to the ancestral elliptical-shaped hairs, spiny hairs had higher tension and stiffness, and overall, hairs with similar morphology had similar functional properties. To examine the genetic basis of this convergent evolution, we tested whether a single amino acid change (V370A) in the Ectodysplasin A receptor (Edar) gene is associated with spiny hair, as this substitution causes thicker and straighter hair in East Asian human populations. We found that most mammals have the common amino acid valine at position 370, but two species, the kangaroo rat (non-spiny) and spiny pocket mouse (spiny), have an isoleucine. Importantly, none of the variants we identified are associated with differences in rodent hair morphology. Thus, the specific Edar mutation associated with variation in human hair does not seem to play a role in modifying hairs in wild rodents, suggesting that different mutations in Edar and/or other genes are responsible for variation in the spiny hair phenotypes we observed within rodents."

However, due to limited genomic data resources, specific high-throughput genotyping tools are not available to many of the salmonid species. In this study, a 57K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was utilized to detect polymorphisms in seven salmonid species, including Hucho taimen, Oncorhynchus masou, Salvelinus fontinalis, Brachymystax lenok, Salvelinus leucomaenis, O. kisutch, and O. mykiss. The number of polymorphic markers per population ranged from 3,844 (O. kisutch) to 53,734 (O. mykiss), indicating that the rainbow trout SNP array was applicable as a universal genotyping tool for other salmonid species. Among the six other salmonid populations from four genera, 28,882 SNPs were shared, whereas 525 SNPs were polymorphic in all four genera. The genetic diversity and population relationships of the seven salmonid species were studied by principal component analysis (PCA). The phylogenetic relationships among populations were analyzed using the maximum likelihood method, which indicated that the shared SNP markers provide reliable genomic information for population genetic analyses in common aquaculture salmonid fishes. Furthermore, this obtained genomic information may be applicable for population genetic evaluation, marker-assisted breeding, and propagative parent selection in fry production."
https://openalex.org/W2886168315,"There are many survey instruments to determine drinking patterns and alcohol consumption levels in the general population. This study aims to compare the context-specific quantity-frequency (CSQF) and beverage-specific quantity-frequency (BSQF) methods to estimate alcohol consumption indices at individual and sample levels. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a population aged 15 years and older in Songkhla Province, Thailand. The BSQF and CSQF questionnaires with a 3-month retrospective time frame and in random order were applied to each participant. The CSQF was developed to ask more about the drinking contexts. The questions elicited information on location, partner, beverage, quantity, and frequency for five common drinking situations. Among 804 participants, 183 drank alcohol in the last three months. At the individual level, total alcohol consumption of almost all types of beverage by the CSQF was higher than the BSQF in approximately 50% of current drinkers and was mainly accounted for by the higher report of average quantity. At the sample level, there were no significant differences in the average daily intake, 3-month intake per drinker or per capita consumption between instruments. The interview duration and burden of answering the questions by the participants for the CSQF were not significantly higher than those for the BSQF. In summary, the fuller picture of drinking behaviors from the CSQF has several valuable methodological advantages and provides information allowing alcohol policies to be more directly specific to certain target populations or situations. The CSQF is a prototype questionnaire and forms the basis for a contextual approach. However, additional methodological studies need to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W2887323718,"The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.5 belongs to the Shaker superfamily. Kv1.5 is composed of four subunits, each comprising 613 amino acids, which make up the N terminus, six transmembrane segments (S1–S6), and the C terminus. We recently demonstrated that, in HEK cells, extracellularly applied proteinase K (PK) cleaves Kv1.5 channels at a single site in the S1–S2 linker. This cleavage separates Kv1.5 into an N-fragment (N terminus to S1) and a C-fragment (S2 to C terminus). Interestingly, the cleavage does not impair channel function. Here, we investigated the role of the N terminus and S1 in Kv1.5 expression and function by creating plasmids encoding various fragments, including those that mimic PK-cleaved products. Our results disclosed that although expression of the pore-containing fragment (Frag(304–613)) alone could not produce current, coexpression with Frag(1–303) generated a functional channel. Immunofluorescence and biotinylation analyses uncovered that Frag(1–303) was required for Frag(304–613) to traffic to the plasma membrane. Biochemical analysis revealed that the two fragments interacted throughout channel trafficking and maturation. In Frag(1–303)+(304–613)-coassembled channels, which lack a covalent linkage between S1 and S2, amino acid residues 1–209 were important for association with Frag(304–613), and residues 210–303 were necessary for mediating trafficking of coassembled channels to the plasma membrane. We conclude that the N terminus and S1 of Kv1.5 can attract and coassemble with the rest of the channel (i.e. Frag(304–613)) to form a functional channel independently of the S1–S2 linkage.

In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, Kv1.5 plays an important role in regulating membrane potential and vascular tone (4Wang J. Juhaszova M. Rubin L.J. Yuan X.J.

Elucidating the biochemical and biophysical properties of Kv channels is important and represents an active area of research. In particular, it is fundamental to understand how each part of ion channel structure contributes to assembly, trafficking, function, and regulation. voltage-gated potassium brefeldin A coimmunoprecipitation human embryonic kidney proteinase K tunicamycin fragment Kv1.5 current Kv1.5-expressing HEK activation-voltage human ether-a-go-go–related gene picofarad minimum essential medium phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride horseradish peroxidase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. A single Kv channel is composed of four α-subunits, often identical, that assemble to form a tetramer (6Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Each α-subunit contains six transmembrane segments, S1–S6, with N and C termini located intracellularly. Each structural component contributes distinctively to channel function. For example, the S4 segment acts as the voltage sensor (8Aggarwal S.K. MacKinnon R. Contribution of the S4 segment to gating charge in the Shaker K+ channel.Neuron. 1996; 16 (8663993): 1169-117710.1016/S0896-6273(00)80143-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The linker of S5 and S6 contributes to forming the K+-selective permeation pore (9Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

However, the roles of other structural components such as the N terminus and S1 segment in expression and function are less well understood. We recently demonstrated that Kv1.5 channels can be cleaved at a single site in the S1–S2 linker by extracellularly applied proteinase K (PK) into an N-fragment that contains the N terminus and S1 and a C-fragment that contains S2 to the C terminus. However, PK-cleaved Kv1.5 still generates robust current (10Hogan-Cann A. Li W. Guo J. Yang T. Zhang S. Proteolytic cleavage in the S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel does not affect channel function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1858 (26874203): 1082-109010.1016/j.bbamem.2016.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the current study, we created plasmids encoding Frag(1–303) (fragment containing amino acid residues 1–303, which make up the N terminus and S1 segment) and the pore-containing Frag(304–613) (fragment containing amino acid residues 304–613, which make up S2–S6 and the C terminus) as well as further defined smaller fragments to investigate the role of the N terminus and S1 in Kv1.5 trafficking and function. Our results showed for the first time that even when the linkage within the S1–S2 linker was absent, Frag(1–303) was able to attract and assemble with Frag(304–613) to form a functional channel. Specifically, residues 1–209 of Frag(1–303) interacted with the independent Frag(304–613). Residues 210–303 (the remaining N terminus and S1 of Frag(1–303)) mediated channel trafficking to the plasma membrane. Further analysis indicated that residues 210–240 of the N terminus were required for the expression of S1–S2 linker-intact Kv1.5 channels in the plasma membrane. These results revealed novel roles of the N terminus and S1 in Kv1.5 channel trafficking and assembly. Using Western blot analysis and whole-cell patch clamp method, we examined the effects of PK treatment on the expression and function of Kv1.5 channels. Kv1.5 channel proteins exist in two forms: the mature form, which is localized in the plasma membrane, and the immature form, which is localized intracellularly. It is the membrane-localized, mature protein that conducts Kv1.5 current (IKv1.5) (10Hogan-Cann A. Li W. Guo J. Yang T. Zhang S. Proteolytic cleavage in the S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel does not affect channel function.Biochim. Biophys.

It undergoes core glycosylation to become a 68-kDa immature channel and further complex glycosylation to become a 75-kDa mature channel localized in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A, lane 1). N-Glycosylation of Kv1.5 occurs at Asn-299 (GenBank accession number NM_002234.3) within the S1–S2 linker (10Hogan-Cann A. Li W. Guo J. Yang T. Zhang S. Proteolytic cleavage in the S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel does not affect channel function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1858 (26874203): 1082-109010.1016/j.bbamem.2016.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Glycosylation is not a prerequisite for the trafficking of Kv1.5 channels to the plasma membrane (10Hogan-Cann A. Li W. Guo J. Yang T. Zhang S. Proteolytic cleavage in the S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel does not affect channel function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1858 (26874203): 1082-109010.1016/j.bbamem.2016.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, after inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin (Tuni; 10 μg/ml, 48 h), both mature (plasma membrane) and immature (intracellular) channels display as a 65-kDa band (Fig. 1A, lane 2). PK, which cannot permeate the cell membrane, cleaves cell-surface protein when applied extracellularly (12Guo J. Massaeli H. Li W. Xu J. Luo T. Shaw J. Kirshenbaum L.A. Zhang S. Identification of IKr and its trafficking disruption induced by probucol in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 321 (17377062): 911-92010.1124/jpet.107.120931Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For normally glycosylated Kv1.5 channels, treatment of intact Kv1.5-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) (Kv1.5-HEK) cells with PK (200 μg/ml, 20 min, 37 °C) selectively abolished the 75-kDa Kv1.5 band without affecting the 68-kDa Kv1.5 band (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The disappearance of the 75-kDa band was accompanied by the appearance of a 42-kDa N-fragment (detected using an N terminus–targeting Kv1.5 antibody; Fig. 1A, left, lane 3) and a 33-kDa C-fragment (detected using a C terminus–targeting Kv1.5 antibody; Fig. 1A, right, lane 3). Resistance of the 68-kDa Kv1.5 protein to PK cleavage confirmed its intracellular location (Fig. 1A, lane 3). For unglycosylated channels (65-kDa; Tuni treatment), PK treatment cleaved the mature, plasma membrane–localized 65-kDa protein but not the immature, intracellularly localized 65-kDa protein (Fig. 1A, lane 4). As a result, PK treatment only decreased the intensity of the 65-kDa protein but did not abolish it. Cleavage of the unglycosylated plasma membrane Kv1.5 protein resulted in the appearance of a 32-kDa N-fragment (Fig. 1A, left, lane 4) and a 33-kDa C-fragment (Fig. 1A, right, lane 4). Thus, removal of glycosylation reduced the N-fragment from 42 to 32 kDa but did not affect the size of the C-fragment (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the glycosylation site (Asn-299) is located within the N-fragment. Together with ExPASy ProtParam analysis based on the fragment sizes, these data indicated that PK likely cleaves Kv1.5 at a site between Asn-299 and the carboxyl end of the S1–S2 linker (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the PK-generated N- and C-fragments associate with each other, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. Our results indicated that the PK-generated N-fragment (42 kDa) and C-fragment (33 kDa) of Kv1.5 did not associate (Fig. 1C) (10Hogan-Cann A. Li W. Guo J. Yang T. Zhang S. Proteolytic cleavage in the S1-S2 linker of the Kv1.5 channel does not affect channel function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1858 (26874203): 1082-109010.1016/j.bbamem.2016.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PK cleavage of Kv1.5 did not impair channel function but instead led to an increase in IKv1.5 without affecting the activation-voltage (g-V) relationships (Fig. 1D). The g-V relationships were fit to the Boltzmann function. The half-maximal activation voltage and the slope factor were −6.95 ± 0.91 mV and 5.55 ± 0.34 in control (n = 36) and −5.82 ± 0.99 mV and 6.12 ± 0.30 in the PK cleavage group (n = 35, p > 0.05). For PK-cleaved full-length Kv1.5 channels, it was of interest to determine whether the C-fragment of Kv1.5, which contains the pore region of the channel, was solely responsible for channel function or whether the N- and C-fragments function together. To this end, we created two independent plasmids in pcDNA3 vectors encoding Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) of Kv1.5 that mimic the PK cleavage products. Specifically, similar to PK-generated fragments, Frag(1–303) contains the N terminus (positions 1–247), S1 (positions 248–269), and part of the S1–S2 linker (positions 270–303; UniProt accession number P22460), which contains the glycosylation site (Asn-299) (Fig. 2). Frag(304–613) constitutes part of the S1–S2 linker, the S2–S6 transmembrane segments, and the C terminus. Upon Western blot analysis, Frag(1–303) displayed a band of ∼35 kDa (Fig. 2A), which is not affected by the removal of glycosylation by Tuni treatment (data not shown). Thus, Frag(1–303) is not glycosylated for unknown reasons. Frag(304–613) displays 30- and 23-kDa bands (Fig. 2B). The 30-kDa band is the full-length C-fragment, and the 23-kDa band is a degradation product that can be abolished by inhibiting protein degradation with lactacystin (10 μm) (data not shown). Thus, Frag(304–613) displayed a molecular mass (30 kDa) similar to the PK-generated C-fragment (33 kDa) (Fig. 2B). However, Frag(1–303) displayed a molecular mass (35 kDa) similar to the PK-generated N-fragment of Tuni-treated Kv1.5-HEK cells (32 kDa) due to a lack of glycosylation (Fig. 2A). We measured the current produced by expressing Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) independently or together in HEK 293 cells. As expected, no current was measurable when Frag(1–303) was expressed independently as it lacks the pore region of the channel (Fig. 2C). However, independent expression of Frag(304–613) also did not produce current despite containing the pore region (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, when Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) were coexpressed, robust current was detected (Fig. 2, E and F). Western blot analysis of whole-cell proteins extracted from Frag(1–303)- and/or Frag(304–613)-expressing cells showed that the two fragments are robustly expressed regardless of whether they are independently expressed or coexpressed (Fig. 3A, left). However, in cells coexpressed with both fragments, a full-length Kv1.5 protein (75 kDa glycosylated or 65 kDa unglycosylated) was not observed (Fig. 3A, left), indicating that the current is generated by a Frag(1–303)+(304–613)-coassembled channel. Frag(304–613) contains the pore region but did not generate current when expressed alone. To determine whether Frag(304–613) requires Frag(1–303) for trafficking to the plasma membrane, we isolated membrane protein using a biotinylation method. Frag(304–613) was barely detected in the membrane protein when it was independently expressed (Fig. 3A, right). In contrast, when both fragments were coexpressed, Frag(304–613) was robustly detected in the isolated membrane protein (Fig. 3A, right). In contrast, Frag(1–303) was detected in the membrane protein regardless of whether it was independently expressed or coexpressed with Frag(304–613) (Fig. 3A, right). These results indicate that Frag(1–303) mediates the trafficking of Frag(304–613) to the plasma membrane. This notion was confirmed by data from immunofluorescence microscopy experiments. As shown in Fig. 3B, Frag(1–303) was able to traffic to the plasma membrane when expressed alone or coexpressed with Frag(304–613). However, Frag(304–613) was retained intracellularly when expressed alone but was present on the plasma membrane when it was coexpressed with Frag(1–303) (Fig. 3B). To determine the association between Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) of Kv1.5, we performed co-IP assays of whole-cell proteins extracted from cells coexpressing both fragments. Unlike the PK-produced fragments (Fig. 1C), Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) associated with one another (Fig. 4A). In a separate set of experiments, Frag(1–303)- and Frag(304–613)-coexpressing cells were treated with PK (200 μg/ml, 20 min, 37 °C) prior to protein extraction and co-IP assays. The association between Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) was still present in the PK-treated cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that, unlike wildtype (WT) Kv1.5 channels, the association between Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) is not in the S1–S2 linker. Additionally, after cotransfection of HEK cells with Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) plasmids, we treated transfected cells with brefeldin A (BFA; 10 μm) for 12 h to inhibit protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus during maturation (13Guo J. Massaeli H. Xu J. Jia Z. Wigle J.T. Mesaeli N. Zhang S. Extracellular K+ concentration controls cell surface density of IKr in rabbit hearts and of the HERG channel in human cell lines.J. Clin. Investig. 2009; 119 (19726881): 2745-275710.1172/JCI39027Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and thus eliminated the cell-surface expression of both fragments. Co-IP analysis indicated that the two fragments are still associated in the presence of BFA (Fig. 4C). Therefore, Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) appear to associate intracellularly before they traffic through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Additionally, consistent with the results shown in Figs. 2, A and B, and 3A, coexpression of Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) did not generate a band close to the full-length channel (e.g. 75 or 65 kDa; Fig. 4), suggesting that, unlike WT, Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613) do not interact in a covalent manner at the S1–S2 linker. Our data so far indicate that Frag(1–303) interacts and coassembles with Frag(304–613), mediating trafficking of coassembled channels to the plasma membrane. To further understand the interaction between Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613), we separated Frag(1–303) into two smaller fragments, Frag(1–209) and Frag(210–303). The separation site was selected based on previous works demonstrating that Kv1.5 with truncation of the N terminus up to residue 209 (ΔN209; contains residues 210–613) produces a functional channel with robust current (14Kurata H.T. Soon G.S. Fedida D. Altered state dependence of C-type inactivation in the long and short forms of human Kv1.5.J. Gen.

This indicates that residues 1–209 are not essential for Kv1.5 trafficking and function provided that the rest of the channel (residues 210–613) is synthesized as a single entity. On Western blots, Frag(1–209) displayed a 30-kDa single protein band, whereas Frag(210–303) displayed two protein bands, a 19-kDa band and a 12-kDa band (Fig. 5A). In an attempt to produce functional channels, Frag(1–209), Frag(210–303), or both were cotransfected with Frag(304–613) in HEK cells. However, none of these combinations produced a current (Fig. 5B). Frag(210–303) contains the glycosylation site and displayed two protein bands (19 and 12 kDa). Tuni treatment eliminated the 19-kDa band but retained the 12-kDa band, indicating that Frag(210–303) undergoes glycosylation (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, treatment of cells with BFA abolished the 19-kDa band but retained the 12-kDa band, indicating that Frag(210–303) trafficked through the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5C). Immunofluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrated that Frag(210–303) was able to traffic to the plasma membrane. In contrast, Frag(1–209) was retained intracellularly (Fig. 5D). To determine whether Frag(1–209) or Frag(210–303) was able to associate with Frag(304–613), co-IP assays were performed. Although Frag(1–209) associated with Frag(304–613) (Fig. 5E), Frag(210–303) did not (Fig. 5F). These results demonstrate that, when S1 and S2 are not covalently linked, Frag(1–209) is important for association with Frag(304–613), and Frag(210–303) is important for mediating trafficking of Frag(304–613) to the plasma membrane. However, neither Frag(1–209) nor Frag(210–303) alone were able to reconstitute a functional channel with Frag(304–613). Rather, both must be conjoined as a single fragment (Frag(1–303)) to interact with Frag(304–613) and form a functional channel. To examine whether Frag(1–209), Frag(210–303), or Frag(1–303) is able to interact with full-length Kv1.5 channel subunits, we independently expressed them with WT Kv1.5 and determined whether they can produce a dominant-negative effect on WT Kv1.5 function (16Babila T. Moscucci A. Wang H. Weaver F.E. Koren G. Assembly of mammalian voltage-gated potassium channels: evidence for an important role of the first transmembrane segment.Neuron. 1994; 12 (8155323): 615-62610.1016/0896-6273(94)90217-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Olson T.M.

Genet. 2006; 15 (16772329): 2185-219110.1093/hmg/ddl143Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To this end, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3 (control) or plasmids encoding Frag(1–209), Frag(210–303), or Frag(1–303) was transfected into Kv1.5-HEK cells. Neither Frag(1–209) nor Frag(210–303) affected IKv1.5 (Fig. 6). However, Frag(1–303) significantly reduced IKv1.5 (Fig. 6). Thus, neither Frag(1–209) nor Frag(210–303) alone were able to interact and interfere with full-length Kv1.5 channels, but Frag(1–303) disrupted full-length Kv1.5 function. To further investigate the role of residues 1–303 in Kv1.5 trafficking and function, we utilized channel truncation strategies. We first truncated the N terminus up to residue 209 from full-length Kv1.5 to obtain ΔN209 mutant (Fig. 7A). This mutant contains residues 210–613, equivalent to the total residues of coexpressed Frag(210–303) and Frag(304–613) but with an intact S1–S2 linkage. Although coexpressed Frag(210–303) and Frag(304–613) (without S1–S2 linkage) did not produce functional channels (Fig. 5B), ΔN209 mutant (residues 210–613 with S1–S2 linkage) produced functional channels (Fig. 7B). This result indicates that when residues 210–303 are covalently linked with the rest of the channel they are sufficient to mediate Kv1.5 channel trafficking to form functional channels. Thus, residues 1–209 are not essential for membrane expression of Kv1.5 channels with the intact S1–S2 linker. However, they are critical for the association of Frag(1–303) and Frag(304–613), which allows for trafficking of Frag(304–613) to the membrane (Fig. 5E). Residues 210–303 contain part of the N terminus (positions 210–247; known as the T1–S1 linker), S1 (positions 248–269), and part of the S1–S2 linker (positions 270–303; UniProt accession number P22460). To determine the role of the T1–S1 linker, we further shortened the N terminus to remove the T1–S1 linker but retain S1; we deleted the N terminus from amino acid 2 to 240 to construct the del(2–240) Kv1.5 mutant. The del(2–240) Kv1.5 mutant displayed two protein bands, a 45-kDa band and a 38-kDa band, in Western blots (Fig. 7A). Results from patch clamp experiments showed that del(2–240) Kv1.5 did not produce current (Fig. 7B). Treatment of HEK cells expressing the del(2–240) Kv1.5 mutant with either Tuni or BFA removed the 45-kDa band, indicating that the del(2–240) channel undergoes complex glycosylation and traffics through the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7C). However, treatment of cells expressing del(2–240) Kv1.5 with PK (200 μg/ml, 20 min, 37 °C) did not affect the 45-kDa band, suggesting that the channel is not expressed in the plasma membrane (Fig. 7C). Results from immunofluorescence microscopy experiments indicated that, in contrast to ΔN209, which displayed plasma membrane expression, the del(2–240) Kv1.5 mutant was retained intracellularly (Fig. 7D). Thus, compared with ΔN209 (residues 210–613), further deletion of N-terminal residues 210–240 completely disrupted Kv1.5 membrane expression. Our results showed that the N terminus interacts with other regions of Kv1.5 channels (Figure 2., Figure 3., Figure 4., Figure 5., Figure 6.), which is in line with previous studies demonstrating that the N terminus affects K+ channel gating (18Minor D.L.

Consistently, although WT Kv1.5 was inactivated to a similar extent (flat) upon 5-s depolarizing voltages between 0 and 90 mV, the N-terminal truncation Kv1.5 mutant ΔN209 displayed a U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation (Fig. 8A), an observation that was also reported by Kurata et al.

Interestingly, although Frag(1–303)+(304–613)-coassembled Kv1.5 channels contained the N terminus, they displayed a U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation, similar to ΔN209 (Fig. 8A). The U-shaped voltage dependence of inactivation has been proposed to be a result of inactivation occurring from late closed states of the channel (19Klemic K.G. Shieh C.C. Kirsch G.E. Jones S.W. Inactivation of Kv2.1 potassium channels.Biophys. J. 1998; 74 (9545040): 1779-178910.1016/S0006-3495(98)77888-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Repeated depolarizations with short periods of negative voltage facilitate inactivation from late closed states, leading to excessive cumulative inactivation (14Kurata H.T. Soon G.S. Fedida D.

As shown in Fig. 8B, shuttling between 60 mV for 90 ms and −80 mV for 10-ms steps resulted in more cumulative inactivation in both ΔN209 and Frag(1–303)+(304–613)-coassembled channels than in WT Kv1.5 channels. Elucidating structure–function relationships is an essential step toward understanding the properties and regulation of Kv channels. Functional reconstitution from two nonoverlapping contiguous fragments represents a useful strategy to study the structure–function relationships for several transmembrane proteins such as β2-adrenergic receptors, M1/M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, lactose permease enzymes (20Bibi E.

https://openalex.org/W2886368515,"Radiation therapy is an integral part of treatment for patients with glioblastoma. New technological advances in linear accelerators have made extra-high dose rate irradiation possible. This shortens patient treatment time significantly compared to standard dose rate irradiation, but the biologic effects of extra high dose rate irradiation are poorly understood. Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are resistant to standard radiation and contribute to tumor progression. Here, we assess the therapeutic effect of extra high dose rate vs. standard dose rate irradiation on GSCs. GSCs were exposed to 2, 4 and 6 Gy X-irradiation at dose rates of 4.2 Gy/min or 21.2 Gy/min (400 monitoring units (MU)/min or 2100 MU/min). We analyzed cell survival with cell growth assays, tumorsphere formation assays and colony formation assays. Cell kill and self-renewal were dependent on the total dose of radiation delivered. However, there was no difference in survival of GSCs or DNA damage repair in GSCs irradiated at different dose rates. GSCs exhibited significant G1 and G2/M phase arrest and increased apoptosis with higher doses of radiation but there was no difference between the two dose rates at each given dose. In a GSC-derived preclinical model of glioblastoma, radiation extended animal survival, but there was no difference in survival in mice receiving different dose rates of radiation. We conclude that GSCs respond to larger fractions of radiation, but extra high dose rate irradiation has no significant biologic advantage in comparison with standard dose rate irradiation."
