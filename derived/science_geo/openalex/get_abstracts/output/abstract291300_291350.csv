protuberancias en una agropaisaje verde. Tierras silvestres desempenan la misma sociedad
papeles como lo hacen las bibliotecas, universidades, museos, salas sinfonicas, y
periodicos. Ellos deben integrarse con el sistema educativo al igual que estos son otros de almacenamiento y transferencia de informacion compleja sistemas. Y su restauracion y su uso puede generar la misma clase de la responsabilidad de proteccion por su sociedad. El proceso de restauracion y gestion puede llevarse con facilidad por el agroecosistema adyacentes como un ejercicio de biomanipulacion. Por lo tanto, se entiende mucho mejor, menos temido y mas deseado en forma de un vecino que es a menudo el caso con los cotos forestales inicialmente intactas. Estudio de las multiples rutas de nuevo a un area silvestre restaurado sera, sin duda, suministrar informacion de valor muy importante para el agroecosistema circundante. Y todo esto es para decir que los seres humanos han ganado la batalla contra la naturaleza. La humanidad se gana la vida mediante la prevencion de la restauracion. Depende de nosotros para aceptar la responsabilidad de poner los vencidos volver a sus pies, patas, y las raices. Podemos hacerlo. Incluso derrotado, la naturaleza tropical tiene mucho que ofrecer para nosotros aceptar un mundo sin ella."

The sectors co-rotate with the sun; as an average sector sweeps past the earth the magnitude of the interplanetary field decreases from greater than 6 gammas (1 gamma = 10(-5) gauss) to less than 4 gammas, and the daily sum of the geomagnetic activity index, Kp, decreases from 25 to less than 10."

Mechanism 1 has a high affinity for potassium, but its affinity for sodium is so low that, in the presence of even a low concentration of potassium (1 mM), sodium absorption by this mechanism is all but abolished. Mechanism 2 has a much lower affinity for alkali cations and is not highly selective; it transports sodium as well as potassium."

Thus some kinds of lichens may be absent from city environments because of atmospheric pollutants which destroy chlorophyll."

The new compound melts incongruently to SiO(2) (quartz) and liquid at 808 degrees +/- 2 degrees C, and it disproportionates to betaNa(2)Si(2)O(5) and quartz at 700 degrees +/- 10 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1997742643,"As evidenced by spectra of Jupiter's decametric radio emissions from 1960 through 1964, Jupiter's satellite Io acts to induce much of the emission and influences the spectral character of the emission. The emission pattern of Io-related emission is derived, and possible interaction mechanisms to explain the Io effect are discussed."

When the oxidizer was oxygen containing small amounts of nitrogen (less than 5 percent), the burning droplets exploded only when a threshold concentration of nitrogen was exceeded. Explosions also occurred when the zirconium was partially nitrided before being burned in pure oxygen. These experiments prove that the presence of nitrogen can cause the explosion of zirconium droplets burning in oxygen-rich atmospheres."

https://openalex.org/W2057774141,The activation energies of ice with varying amounts of impurities added were investigated with sintered platinum electrodes. For both types of impurities the activation energy was minimum at a concentration of 10(-4)M. The experimental arrangement and possible reasons for the existence of a minimum in activation energy are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2038137962,"A compilation of precision echo soundings has delineated the complex topography between the Sohm and Hatteras abyssal plains off the Atlantic coast of the United States. At present the divide between the two plains is a broad, flat area about 4950 meters deep; however, the configuration of channels and depressions suggests spillage of turbidity currents from the Sohm Plain into the Hatteras Plain and a shifting of the divide toward the northeast. Hudson Canyon terminates in the divide area and has probably fed sediment into both plains."

https://openalex.org/W2026434341,"The waters of the recent floods in Vermont and Massachusetts reached the haymows of hundreds of barns. Excessive heating set in almost immediately after the flood waters receded, endangering the farm buildings. Observations were made at 13 different farms in the valleys of the Winooski, Lamoille and Mississquoi Rivers. These observations are summarized in the following statements: 1. From half a foot to seventeen feet of the piles were under water. 2. In every pile of wet hay observed some ""heating"" had taken place, frequently to the point of being considered dangerous. 3. Heat was generated in the bottom layers of the piles and, escaping up through the hay, led to the production of draughts of hot gases or ""flues"" rising to the surface. 4. The large quantity of moisture carried with the hot gases from the lower layers was condensed on the upper, cooler hay, or in the air above. Many hay piles had been soaked throughout by the falling condensed moisture. 5. While the hot hay was being removed from the barns only one farmer had observed any charred materials. 6. The maximum temperature found (besides one case of fire) was 74 degrees C., though temperatures above 70 degrees were recorded in other places. 7. The most marked evidence of excessive heating was observed (by the farmers) on the second and third days after the recession of the flood waters. 8. One authentic case of ""spontaneous"" combustion of hay caused by the flood was reported. The outstanding features were: a. The lower two feet of the pile consisted of old hay from the preceding season (1926). b. Covering this lower 2-foot section of old hay was a 6-inch layer of first cutting alfalfa. c. Two feet beneath the top surface of the 42-foot pile was another 6-inch layer of alfalfa (second cutting). d. This hay pile which fired ""spontaneously"" was the only one containing even a small quantity of alfalfa. The urgent need for extensive research upon the problem of the ""spontaneous"" heating of farm products was emphasized by the lack of scientific knowledge with which to meet the situation."

Bacon, published in the issue for April 27, pp. 399 to 403, two errors occurred. footnote on p. 402 should read: The system of industrial research founded by the late Dr. Robert Kennedy Duncan was initiated at the University of Kansas, and later transferred to the University of Pittsburgh. name of William A.
