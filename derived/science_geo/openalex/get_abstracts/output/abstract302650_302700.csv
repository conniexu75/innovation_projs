https://openalex.org/W2110619496,"Platinum metals are depleted in the earth's crust relative to their cosmic abundance; concentrations of these elements in deep-sea sediments may thus indicate influxes of extraterrestrial material. Deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand show iridium increases of about 30, 160, and 20 times, respectively, above the background level at precisely the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 65 million years ago. Reasons are given to indicate that this iridium is of extraterrestrial origin, but did not come from a nearby supernova. A hypothesis is suggested which accounts for the extinctions and the iridium observations. Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record. One prediction of this hypothesis has been verified: the chemical composition of the boundary clay, which is thought to come from the stratospheric dust, is markedly different from that of clay mixed with the Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones, which are chemically similar to each other. Four different independent estimates of the diameter of the asteroid give values that lie in the range 10 +/- 4 kilometers."

This approach permits identification of an inherent structure in liquids that is normally obscured by thermal motions. Melting and freezing occur through characteristic sequences of molecular packings, and a defect-softening phenomenon underlies the fact that they are thermodynamically first order. The topological distribution of feasible transitions between contiguous potential minima explains glass transitions and associated relaxation behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1976126573,"The no-tillage cropping system, a combination of ancient and modern agricultural practices, has been rapidly increasing in use. By the year 2000, as much as 65 percent of the acreage of crops grown in the United States may be grown by the no-tillage practice. Soil erosion, the major source of pollutants in rural streams, is virtually eliminated when no-tillage agriculture is practiced. The no-tillage system reduces the energy input into corn and soybean production by 7 and 18 percent, respectively, when compared to the conventional tillage system of moldboard plowing followed by disking. In addition, crop yields are as high as or higher than those obtained with traditional tillage practices on large areas of agricultural land."
https://openalex.org/W2008185637,"A response of plant growth to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has been anticipated from laboratory data, may now have been detected in the annual rings of subalpine conifers growing in the western United States. Experimental evidence shows that carbon dioxide can be an important limiting factor in the growth of plants in this high-altitude environment. The greatly increased tree growth rates observed since the mid-l9th century exceed those expected from climatic trends but are consistent in magnitude with global trends in carbon dioxide, especially in recent decades. If correctly interpreted, these findings have important implications for climate studies involving tree ring observations and for models of the global carbon dioxide budget."
https://openalex.org/W2045965176,"The palynologically defined Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in the western interior of North America occurs at the top of an iridium-rich clay layer. The boundary is characterized by the abrupt disappearance of certain pollen species, immediately followed by a pronounced, geologically brief change in the ratio of fern spores to angiosperm pollen. The occurrence of these changes at two widely separated sites implies continentwide disruption of the terrestrial ecosystem, probably caused by a major catastrophic event at the end of the period."
https://openalex.org/W2061791653,"Three cysteine-rich proteins of molecular weight 4000 to 7000, containing 4 to 7 gram atoms of cadmium, zinc, and copper per mole were isolated from Pseudomonas putida growing in 3 mM cadmium. The three proteins were induced during different phases of growth, and the smallest (molecular weight 3600; 3 gram atoms of cadmium) was released into the medium when the cells lysed. The results of amino acid analyses and of ultraviolet, circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and cadmium-113 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggest a novel cadmium(II)-zinc(II)-copper(I) cluster structure for the major protein."
https://openalex.org/W2071304612,"Seven genera of flying squirrels share five characters of wrist anatomy, which form a functional complex associated with the support of the patagium. In these characters, they differ from all genera of tree and ground squirrels examined. Among mammals, gliding membranes have evolved independently in several other groups. The manner of attachment of the patagium to the forelimb is different in each and demonstrates five morphologies differing from that of flying squirrels. This complex wrist anatomy of flying squirrels provides evidence that gliding evolved only once among squirrels and that the flying squirrels are a monophyletic group."
https://openalex.org/W2037100149,"Interfacial precipitation of silver halides in water-swollen polymer films occurred in complex, multilayered patterns if the concentrations of counterdiffusing reactants were unequal or decreased at different rates. Development of the rapidly forming Liesegang rings, which extend the phenomenon of periodic precipitation to the submicrometer range, is attributable to the combined effect of a moving reaction zone and periodic immobilization of colloidal silver halide."

https://openalex.org/W2066513944,"Informal and structured collaboration is becoming increasingly common in international agricultural research. A network approach to research generally reduces costs, minimizes duplication, and boosts efficiency. Collaborative teams, sometimes involving hundreds of scientists in dozens of countries, have been formed to tackle numerous constraints to boosting food production. Networks have been established to test crop germplasm over a broad range of environments, explore ways of boosting the efficiency of fertilizer use, upgrade disease resistance in livestock, and identify socioeconomic obstacles to improved agricultural output. The benefits of networking are especially valuable to countries with limited funds and scientific manpower."
https://openalex.org/W2094404122,"Simulations of the atmospheric chemistry of sulfate and inorganic nitrate formation have been carried out by means of a detailed gas phase-liquid phase chemical kinetic mechanism. Consideration has been given to the effect of changes in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and reactive hydrocarbon concentrations on sulfate and nitrate formation for conditions typical of the midwestern and northeastern United States. The results indicate significant nonlinearities in the chemistry of acid formation, particularly between sulfur dioxide and sulfate concentrations."

Ach., em. Degel. and Trebouxia impressa Ahm., the algal partner (phycobiont) of Physcia stellaris (L.) Nyl. The parasitic action was noted even on media which would optimally sustain the independent growth of the individual symbionts."
