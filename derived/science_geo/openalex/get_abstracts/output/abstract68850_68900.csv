https://openalex.org/W1588000118,"The solubilities of amino acids, diglycine, and triglycine have been measured in water and aqueous ethanol as well as dioxane solutions. Free energies of transfer of amino acid side chains and backbone peptide units from water to ethanol and dioxane solutions have been calculated from these data. The results show the similarity between the effects of ethanol and dioxane on the stability of those side chains and peptide units. In particular, the free energies of transfer of hydrophobic side chains to 100% ethanol and dioxane are essentially identical, and have been used to establish a hydrophobicity scale for hydrophobic side chains."
https://openalex.org/W2034453670,Higher activity of midgut microsomal oxidase enzymes in polyphagous than in monophagous species indicates that the natural function of these enzymes is to detoxify natural insecticides present in the larval food plants. Differing strategies of adaptation to plant defenses may partly account for the great diversity of insect herbivores.
https://openalex.org/W1530516343,"Protein synthesis in heart muscle has been studied in the isolated rat heart perfused with buffer containing glucose and various amino acid mixtures. The rate of synthesis was evaluated by measuring incorporation of 14C-phenylalanine into whole heart protein and myosin. Protein degradation was estimated by measuring the fall in the specific activity of the free phenylalanine pool and the release of phenylalanine from the heart. 14C-Phenylalanine was suitable for these studies since it equilibrated rapidly with an intracellular pool of stable size and was not converted to other amino acids. Participation of the intracellular free amino acid pool as an intermediate in the pathway of protein synthesis was established. Synthesis of whole heart protein and myosin was increased about 40% when amino acid levels were increased from 1 to 5 times normal plasma levels. A group of 12 amino acids substituted for the complete mixture in producing this effect. Protein degradation appeared to occur at about twice the rate of protein synthesis during perfusion with normal plasma levels of amino acid. When perfusate levels of amino acid were raised, cellular levels of 12 amino acids increased. In general, intracellular amino acid levels reached stable values within 30 min. These studies indicated that protein synthesis in heart muscle could be stimulated by raising perfusate amino acid levels above those normally found in rat plasma. Although net uptake of isoleucine and leucine was observed, suggesting that these amino acids were used as oxidative substrate, the increased rate of synthesis appeared to be due to a direct effect on the pathway of protein synthesis rather than an indirect effect mediated by changes in energy levels of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1496711114,"Two isomorphously substituted derivatives of the nuclease-Ca2+-thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate complex have been prepared and used in an x-ray crystallographic study of the molecular structure. In one case, 5-iododeoxyuridine 3',5'-diphosphate was used in place of thymidine 3',5'-diphosphate (a net replacement of CH3 by I), and, in the other, Ba2+ was used in place of Ca2+. Intensities of all reflections and their Friedel pairs within the 4 A sphere were measured on this inhibitor complex and its two substituted derivatives; in addition, approximately 35% of the data between 4 A and 2 A were collected, selection being made on the basis of the peak to background ratios. These data have been used to produce an electron density map of sufficient quality to allow a complete tracing of the peptide chain except for a few residues at each terminus which presumably project into solution and are too disordered to be distinguishable from solvent. Approximately 30 residues are involved in three separated sections of helix, and about 24 residues form a three-stranded section of antiparallel β-pleated sheet. Residues 44 to 53 form a loop which is loose, highly exposed to solvent, and somewhat disordered. Residues Lys-48 and Lys-49, which are selectively vulnerable to trypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis, lie at the extremum of this loop. The most significant feature of the nuclease structure is a large pocket which serves as the inhibitor binding site. With the electron density maps now available, the lining of this pocket is revealed to be predominantly neutral or hydrophobic with the exception of several residues which specifically participate in binding the calcium ion and the nucleoside diphosphate. Of the latter, the most conspicuous are Lys-84 and Tyr-85 which form hydrogen bonds to the 3'-phosphate, the guanidinium moieties of Arg-35 and Arg-87 which form hydrogen bonds to the 5'-phosphate, and the carboxylate ions of Glu-43, Asp-21, and Asp-40 which serve as ligands to the calcium ion. Although the calcium ion is directly below the 5'-phosphate, it is not close enough for direct interaction with it. It appears that the barium ion occupies a position significantly different from that of the calcium ion."
https://openalex.org/W1597924995,"Abstract The effect of ferroxidase I (ceruloplasmin) on the mobilization of iron into a buffered solution without plasma proteins in perfused dog and pig livers and the appearance of iron was detected by Fe(III)-transferrin formation and an independent iron analysis. Among the various compounds tested, only ferroxidase I, as low as 4 nm, was capable of mobilizing iron into the perfusate. CuSO4, HCO3- citrate, apotransferrin, glucose, fructose, and serum albumin (±Cu(II)) were inactive. Above 0.2 µm ferroxidase I, the rate of iron mobilization did not increase, suggesting that the efflux of iron from the liver depends not only on ferroxidase activity but also on the rate of labile iron formation and its subsequent diffusion from the iron storage cell. The rate at which iron appears in the perfusate is a function of the ferroxidase concentration. However, the amount of iron mobilized is not dependent on either the ferroxidase or apotransferrin concentration. It is proposed that ferroxidase activity results in the substantial elimination of Fe(II), generating a maximum concentration gradient from the iron stores to the capillary system, thus promoting a rapid iron efflux from the iron storage cells of the perfused liver."
https://openalex.org/W1542976889,"Abstract The proteins associated with various membrane fractions, including smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and mitochondria of rat liver, were solubilized with sodium lauryl sulfate and separated by electrophoresis on sodium lauryl sulfate acrylamide gels. Smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum have similar electrophoretic patterns. All other fractions have characteristic patterns in which no single or predominant protein occurs. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum fraction was fractionated by use of Triton X-100, which solubilized approximately 50% of the membrane proteins. The patterns of Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble proteins are distinctive. The relative rates of degradation of the proteins were studied by use of a double isotope technique in which 14C-leucine was administered to intact rats 4 days prior to administration of 3H-leucine. As indicated by the differences in 3H:14C ratios, there is a marked heterogeneity of turnover of proteins of both the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. There is a general correlation between the relative degradation rates of membrane proteins and the molecular size of the protein (subunit) as separated by electrophoresis in sodium lauryl sulfate acrylamide gels. This general relationship was found also for the soluble protein fraction of rat liver, whether fractionated by sodium lauryl sulfate acrylamide gels, or by Sephadex G-200 columns in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate. A model in which membrane proteins associated and dissociate from the protein-lipid complex is favored to explain the heterogeneity of degradation, and the general correlation of size with degradation rate."
https://openalex.org/W1579140970,"Abstract Components of the ribosome cycle, subunits and polysomes, were extracted from heart muscle and analyzed on exponential sucrose gradients. When MgCl2 was added in concentrations above 2 mm, subunits were aggregated and sedimented in the position in which monomeric ribosomes would be expected. Subunit peaks were identified by extraction and analysis of RNA. Perfusion of hearts with buffer containing phenylalanine and glucose decreased polysomes and increased levels of ribosomal subunits. These findings, together with a fall in the rate of protein synthesis, indicated that a block in initiation of peptide chains had developed during perfusion of the heart. When 1 or 5 times normal plasma levels of amino acids were added to the buffer, protein synthesis increased and levels of subunits decreased, indicating that initiation had been facilitated. However, levels of subunits and polysomes were not restored to levels in vivo. Protein synthesis in perfused hearts was inhibited by cycloheximide in association with lower levels of subunits and increased polysomes. These findings indicated that steps involved in elongation of peptide chains had been inhibited. When protein synthesis of hearts perfused with buffer containing glucose and amino acids was stimulated by addition of insulin, levels of subunits decreased and levels of polysomes rose, indicating that insulin had accelerated steps involved in initiation of peptide chains."
https://openalex.org/W1989947938,A method is described which permits rapid phenotypic diagnosis of the Lesch-Nyhan heterozygote by direct assay of hypoxanthine guanine phosphori-bosyltransferase activity in single hair follicles obtained from the scalp.
https://openalex.org/W1570900932,"Abstract The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome has been characterized by an apparently complete deficiency in erythrocytes of an enzyme of purine metabolism, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase. Recent studies have suggested that low levels of this enzyme may be present in skin fibroblasts cultured from these patients. In the present study, we have confirmed the presence of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in these mutant cells. The mean activity in 11 mutant strains ranged from 0.6 to 7% of that observed in normal cells. This low level of activity did not appear to be due to the presence of another enzyme or enzymes with similar activity or to contamination of the cultured cells. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase from nine mutant strains was found to exhibit certain distinctive properties. In contrast to the normal enzyme, the enzymes from eight mutant strains were relatively heat-labile and the enzyme from one mutant strain was not responsive to product inhibition by GMP or IMP. These findings provide evidence for substantial heterogeneity of the mutations leading to a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. In addition, the finding of functionally altered enzyme in at least 10 of the mutant strains provides evidence that in these cases the genetic alteration responsible for the deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase resides in a structural gene coding for the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1482307610,"A mixture of equal weights of the β (hormone-specific) chain of bovine thyrotropin and the α chain of human chorionic gonadotropin yields thyroid-stimulating activity similar to that observed by recombination of the two chains of thyrotropin itself. Recombination to yield gonadotropic activity occurs between the α chain of the chorionic gonadotropin and the hormone-specific chain of luteinizing hormone from bovine pituitaries. The data provide strong evidence that an α type chain, whose structure has been shown to be nearly identical in bovine pituitary thyrotropin and luteinizing hormones, is also utilized in the placenta for the formation of its gonadotropic hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1498324641,"Several inactive and structurally disordered fragments of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues, free of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl groups) have previously been shown to yield productive complementation through noncovalent interaction. Nuclease-T-(6-48) (residues 6 to 48) binds to nuclease-T-(49-149) to form nuclease-T'. Nuclease-T' possesses enzymic activity at a level approximately 8% that of nuclease and appears to have a structure similar to the native enzyme. A second type of enzymically active structure, similar to nuclease-T', is formed in approximately 50% yield when nuclease-T-(49-149) binds to the portion of nuclease-(1-126) that contains residues 6 to 48. The redundant portion (residues 49-126) of nuclease-(1-126) seems to protrude flexibly from the otherwise ordered structure of the complex. The present study shows that nuclease-(1-126) can bind to the cyanogen bromide fragment, nuclease-(99-149), to form a complex with ordered structure which also exhibits enzymic activity similar to that of nuclease-T'. Limited digestion with trypsin in the presence of the ligands, deoxythymidine 3',5'-diphosphate and Ca++, removes residues 99 to 110 from the complex without destruction of enzymic activity. The derived complex is composed of nuclease-(1-126) and nuclease-(111-149). These two fragments have been isolated, identified, and shown to regenerate the enzymic activity upon mixing. Removal by carboxy- and aminopeptidases of residues 124 to 126 and residues 111 to 113 from nuclease-(1-126) and nuclease-(111-149), respectively, appears to cause no diminution in the activity of the complex formed from the two shortened fragments. The studies reported here have also shown that two types of active, complementing structures are formed simultaneously and in approximately equal amounts when nuclease-T-(49-149) is mixed with nuclease-(1-126). In one of the alternative structures, nuclease-(1-126) binds to the portion of nuclease-T-(49-149) that contains residues 111 to 149. In the second, the nuclease-T-(49-149) combines with the portion of nuclease-(1-126) that contains residues 1 to 48. The respective redundant portions (residues 49 to 110 of nuclease-T-(49-149) and residues 49 to 126 of nuclease-(1-126)) appear to be flexible and independent of the ordered portions of the complexes, and are susceptible to specific removal by trypsin in the presence of ligands. The fragments, nuclease-(1-48) and nuclease-(111-149), participating in the two active complexes, ((1-48) + (49-149)) and ((1-126) + (111-149)), were isolated from such trypsin digests and were quantitatively identified. The results are consistent with the concept that essentially the entire amino acid sequence is required to furnish the minimum information necessary to determine the stable and functional structure of staphylococcal nuclease. It also appears that stable structures closely resembling the native enzyme can be formed in several ways from flexible and disordered fragments when the minimum informational requirement is fulfilled."
https://openalex.org/W1550638451,"Abstract Dissociation of both human deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) and carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) at alkaline pH exposes previously buried tyrosine residues to the environment and alters their pK. Subunit association and dissociation of deoxy-Hb and HbCO can be followed through spectral changes which arise from these changes in tyrosine ionization above pH 10.0. The difference spectrum of the dissociation reaction contains a contribution from both tyrosine and tryptophan. Ultracentrifuge results confirm that a tetramerdimer equilibrium exists at these high pH values. The tetramer-dimer dissociation constant, K4,2, of both HbCO and deoxy-Hb increases dramatically above pH 10.0 and the value of K4,2 for HbCO is significantly greater than the value of K4,2 for deoxy-Hb in the pH range of 7 to 11. The groups responsible for the spectral change on dissociation have been tentatively identified with Tyr C7(42)α and Trp C3(37)β, which lie in the α1-β2 interface. Substantial quantities of deoxy-Hb dimers are produced at high pH. The properties of these dimers have been examined both at high pH and at pH 7.0 after rapid pH drop in the stopped flow apparatus. Association of deoxy-Hb dimers to the tetramer is accompanied by a spectral change in the Soret region, which has allowed us to follow the association reaction at pH 7.0. Deoxy-Hb dimers react rapidly with CO at a rate characteristic of noncooperative species (l' = 6.5 x 106 m-1 sec-1). Further, human haptoglobin 1-1 binds these deoxy-Hb dimers at pH 7.0 at a rate similar to that observed with HbCO dimers (6.3 x 105 m-1 sec-1 and 5.5 x 105 m-1 sec-1, respectively). We conclude that the deoxy-Hb dimer, the unliganded dimer derived from liganded hemoglobin, and the HbCO dimer are identical in conformation, α1β1; the first two are noncooperative in their ligand-binding properties. The hemoglobin tetramer is therefore the minimum unit capable of full cooperativity in ligand binding. Models in which the free hemoglobin dimer is assumed to possess basically the same functional properties as the tetramer are untenable."

Direct physiological measurements, as expressed in summated auditory evoked cortical responses, unequivocally demonstrate that click noises show a greater amplitude of initial output over the right brain, and that verbal stimuli produce either equal or higher amplitudes of output over the left cerebral hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W1580066162,"Abstract An examination of fractions from extracts of porcine pituitary has revealed the presence of a number of peptide components active in restoring the ability of hypophysectomized rats to acquire a conditioned avoidance response. None of the products appears to exhibit hormonal activity as measured by effects on adrenal, testis, thymus, or total body weight. The active component of lowest molecular weight was isolated and characterized as deglycinamide9-lysine vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W2800830757,"We have developed a new method of countercurrent chromatography which employs a vertical helical tube in the centrifugal field. The helical tube is arranged so that it does not rotate as it revolves, thus eliminating the need for rotating seals. When the gyrating tube is filled with either phase and the other phase is introduced into the tube in the proper direction, an equilibrium state results in which the two phases are split into multiple alternating segments within the coil. Each phase oscillates to and fro with the rotation as the moving phase is steadily eluted out through the other end of the tube. Consequently, solutes introduced into the tube are subjected to a rapid partition process, resulting in an efficient chromatographic separation without the complications arising from solid supports. The method is illustrated by the microanalytical separation of dinitrophenyl amino acids and can be used on a preparative scale."
https://openalex.org/W1502695369,"Abstract Homogenates prepared from bovine heart muscle contain two distinct forms of malic enzyme (malate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating), EC 1.1.1.40), which can be easily separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. A partial purification of the two enzymes has been accomplished by means of DEAE-cellulose chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and chromatography on CM-Sephadex. The isolated fractions migrate at different rates on disc gel electrophoresis and appear to have a similar molecular weight (approximately 200,000) as determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and gel filtration. Malic enzyme has also been purified from isolated bovine heart mitochondria, and all the properties of this enzyme correspond to one of the forms isolated from the homogenate. On the basis of these observations, it is concluded that malic enzyme is present in both the cytosol and the mitochondria of bovine heart, a distribution similar to that observed in bovine adrenal cortex but clearly distinct from that of liver."
https://openalex.org/W155301444,"Abstract The specificity of linoleic acid isomerase from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens for cis-9,cis-12-dienoic fatty acids with an ω chain length varying from 4 to 8 carbons has been examined. The enzyme was found to be highly specific for a straight chain fatty acid bearing an ω chain length of 6 carbon atoms. Stereospecific addition of hydrogen to carbon atom 13 of linoleic acid in the d configuration was demonstrated. It was deduced that the substrate was bound to the enzyme in the form of a loop and that the mechanism of isomerization involves either the protonation of an enzyme-bound carbanion or a concerted reaction. A tentative model with the carboxyl oxygens of the substrate participating in the isomerization reaction is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1677598453,"Abstract When 3H-estradiol is administered to rats or incubated with rat uteri, the bulk of the labeled estrogen is found in the nuclear fraction. In previous work, nuclei prepared in media containing low salt (0.1 m or less KCl) were then extracted with a high salt medium (0.4 m KCl) to obtain an estrogen-protein complex sedimenting at approximately 5 S. We have now found that homogenizing the uteri directly in the high salt media results in the extraction of an estrogen-protein complex that sediments at ∼6 S. The cytoplasmic uterine binding protein, when treated with high salt media, is principally 4 S but contains approximately 20% 6 S. The 6 S, 5 S, and 4 S entities all have approximately the same affinity for estrogen (Kd, 2 to 4 x 10-10). These and other experiments suggest that, although the relationship between the 8 S, 6 S, 5 S, and 4 S forms of estrogen-binding protein is not clear, they all contain a common estrogen binding site and likely represent different states of aggregation of one or more types of protein subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1595977867,"Abstract Perfusion of the isolated rat heart under anaerobic conditions inhibited synthesis of whole heart protein and myosin. The effect was reversible and did not appear to be due to the decrease in mechanical activity. Anaerobic inhibition of protein synthesis appeared to be due to a block in incorporation of free amino acids from the intracellular pool into protein rather than a block in the entry of amino acids into the cell. Intracellular levels of amino acids were either unchanged or increased in the anaerobic heart with exception of aspartic and glutamic acids. Entry of aspartic acid, isoleucine, and phenylalanine into the cell was unchanged by anoxia, whereas entry of glycine, aminoisobutyric acid, and lysine was accelerated. Inhibition of protein synthesis was associated with somewhat fewer ribosomal subunits and more polysomes than found in aerobic hearts perfused under the same conditions. A 50% reduction in GTP and a 3-fold increase in GMP was found in the anaerobic heart."
https://openalex.org/W1539187624,"Abstract Intact cells of Pseudomonas putida grown on l-lysine degrade lysine via two distinct pathways. One pathway, previously reported for pseudomonads, proceeds via 5-carbon acyclic intermediates. The other involves conversion of lysine to the 6-carbon cyclic imino acid pipecolate. d- and l-Lysine are interconvertible, but d-lysine appears to be the immediate substrate for the pipecolate pathway while l-lysine is the substrate for the acyclic pathway. Both pathways appear to be of approximately equal quantitative importance for lysine degradation. The carboxyl of lysine is converted to the carboxyl of pipecolate and pipecolate retains the e-nitrogen of lysine. Experiments with P. fluorescens suggest that degradation of lysine via pipecolate may occur in other pseudomonads."
https://openalex.org/W1508621282,"Abstract An isozyme of nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDP kinase) has been purified from human erythrocytes. The best preparations were purified about 9000-fold from hemolysates to specific activities of about 1000 units per mg of protein. The isoelectric point of the partially purified sample, with an isoelectric focusing technique, was found to be 7.3, whereas a highly purified preparation of erythrocytic NDP kinase described earlier was found to consist principally of isozymes with pI values of 5.8 and 6.3. The enzyme is stable and shows a wide pH optimum (7.0 to 9.5). Michaelis constants (Km) for ATP and dTDP were 1.3 x 10-4 m and 2.7 x 10-4 m, respectively. p-Chloromercuribenzoate (PMB) inactivates the enzyme completely which could be reactivated by use of dithiothreitol, suggesting the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups. Substrates such as ATP or dTDP, in the presence or absence of Mg++, markedly protect the enzyme against inactivation by PMB. Although urea at a concentration of 2 m does not influence the enzymic activity, this concentration of urea renders the enzyme susceptible to irreversible inactivation by PMB. The enzymic reaction requires the presence of a divalent cation. Mg++, Mn++, and Co++ are equally effective. Ca++ is 50% effective, whereas Zn++ and Cu++ cannot satisfy divalent cation requirement. Studies of the effect of temperature on reaction velocity yielded a diphasic Arrhenius plot with a transition point at 31°. Energy of activation above and below 31° are 4.8 and 10.3 kcal m-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1496745654,"Abstract The γ chains of human fetal hemoglobin occur in both acetylated and nonacetylated state in vivo. The acetylated fetal hemoglobin F1 has been suggested to be α2γγacetyl (Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 63, 532 (1962)). The development of an electrophoretic assay capable of separating the α, β, γ, and γacetyl polypeptide chains in hemoglobins allowed us to show that highly purified hemoglobin F1 contained nearly equal quantities of α chains and a polypeptide chain migrating more slowly than the γ chain, and only trace quantities of γ chain. NH2-terminal and acetyl group analyses of globin prepared from hemoglobin F1 indicated the presence of 2 NH2-terminal valine residues, 0.4 NH2-terminal glycine residue, and 1.6 N-acetyl groups per mole of hemoglobin (molecular weight of 66,000). The acetylated polypeptide chain was isolated from carboxymethyl cellulose columns in the presence of 8 m urea and shown to have a blocked NH2 terminus, to contain 0.76 mole of N-acetyl residue per polypeptide chain (molecular weight of 16,500), and to migrate identically with the slow moving polypeptide chain of hemoglobin F1 in the electrophoretic assay. The acetylated NH2-terminal peptide was isolated from both F1 globin and the isolated γacetyl chain, and shown to be N-acetylglycylhistidine. This structure is consistent with the NH2-terminal sequence of the γ chain. These data indicate human fetal hemoglobin F1 should be designated α2γ2acetyl."
https://openalex.org/W1563631819,"Abstract Uridine phosphorylase (uridine:orthophosphate ribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.3) of rat liver cytoplasm has been purified 1900-fold. Initial velocity patterns of the phosphorolysis of uridine or deoxyuridine and of the synthesis of uridine indicated a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition patterns with uracil or ribose 1-phosphate as inhibitors were consistent with an ordered Bi reaction in which inorganic phosphate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme and ribose 1-phosphate the last product to leave the enzyme. The most highly purified enzyme fractions still retained uridine-, deoxyuridine-, and thymidine-cleaving activities in the ratio of 10:7:1 at pH 7.4. The fractions separated into a major and a minor band of protein on electrophoresis in phosphate buffer. Aging of the enzyme with loss of activity resulted in an increase in the proportion of the minor band. The pH optimum of the enzyme for uridine cleavage was 8.2, for deoxyuridine cleavage, 6.5, and for uridine synthesis, 8.5. Uridine or deoxyuridine synthesis was inhibited 50% in the presence of 1 mm uracil. The enzyme did not catalyze the direct transfer of ribose from uridine to uracil in the absence of phosphate. Uridine protected the enzyme to a greater degree than phosphate against inhibition by o-iodosobenzoate. Thus, at least one sulfhydryl group and possibly three are present at or near the active site. Uridine cleavage, uridine synthesis, and deoxyuridine cleavage were inhibited by deoxyglucosylthymine. The phosphorolysis of deoxyuridine and thymidine by thymidine phosphorylase, also purified from rat liver cytoplasm, was not inhibited by deoxyglucosylthymine. The molecular weights of both uridine and thymidine phosphorylases were estimated to be 110,000."
https://openalex.org/W1676570384,"Abstract Sedimentation analyses of postmitochondrial supernatant fluids and preparations of purified polyribosomes from rat cerebral cortex revealed that the proportion of large ribosomal aggregates diminished during development. This phenomenon was not associated with variations in ribonuclease activity in the different preparations. Polyribosomes isolated from cerebral tissue of animals 14 days of age or older exhibited a loss of heavy components in vitro when the Mg2+ concentration of the medium in which they were suspended for analysis was reduced from 10 to 1 mm. Similar preparations from infant rats (0 to 2 days old) disaggregated only slightly in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+. Developmental alterations in the stability of cerebral messenger RNA-ribosome complexes did not result in differences in the over-all capacity of the polyribosomal preparations for amino acid incorporation in vitro. The largest polyribosomes were initially most active in vivo in incorporation of [3H]leucine into ribosomal bound protein of cerebral cortices of rats varying in age from 0 to 42 days. However, the fraction of ribosomal bound radioactive protein which was associated with ribosomes lighter than the tetramer as early as 5 min after intracisternal administration of the isotopic amino acid was considerably greater in immature rats (14 days old) and adult rats (42 days old) than in newborn animals. Moreover, this fraction was further enhanced in the succeeding 10-min interval in the older animals, but not in newborn rats. The proportion of nascent, nonribosomal protein found in cerebral postmitochondrial supernatant fluids 5 min after administration of labeled leucine was also greater in the immature and adult rats than in newborn animals. These results suggest that the proportion of unstable messenger RNA-ribosome complexes in cerebral cortex of the rat increases during development. The data also indicate that polyribosomal instability may be associated with specialized function in the mature brain."
https://openalex.org/W1551484670,"Deoxyadenosine kinase was partially purified 140-fold from calf thymus by fractionation with streptomycin, protamine, and ammonium sulfate and by column chromatography on Sephadex G-150 and DEAE-cellulose. The molecular weight was estimated to be about 63,000 by gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme appears to catalyze the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and cytidine to their corresponding nucleoside 5'-monophosphates in the presence of a divalent cation and a nucleoside 5'-triphosphate. All common ribo- and deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates, with the exception of deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate, could act as phosphate donors."
https://openalex.org/W1530352739,"Abstract Exchange of phospholipids between chylomicrons, artificial fat emulsions, phosphatidylcholine liquid crystals (liposomes), and mitochondria was observed. Exchange of phosphatidylcholine also occurred, in the absence of a biological membrane fraction, between liposomes and a fat emulsion stabilized with phospholipid. A protein fraction in the soluble portion of a rat liver homogenate accelerated phospholipid exchange in all systems from 3- to 30-fold. Exchange of phosphatidylcholine between labeled liposomes and unlabeled mitochondria showed a roughly proportional increase with the amount of cytosol protein added. This system appears suitable and convenient for the assay of the phospholipid exchange-stimulating fraction."
https://openalex.org/W1576456979,"Microsomes and crude ribosomes from spleens of immunized rats were more active in polyuridylic acid-stimulated phenylalanine incorporation than were corresponding particles from control spleens. Ribosomes were more active than homologous microsomes, suggesting the presence of an inhibitor bound to the membranes. Stripping the ribosomes of bound factors partially diminished their ability to incorporate amino acids, but also eliminated differences between control and immunized particles. The pH 5 enzyme fraction from immunized spleen was almost as active as that from liver in stimulating amino acid incorporation by stripped liver ribosomes. This fraction from control spleen was almost inactive. Fractionation and partial purification of the transfer factors, aminoacyltransferase (T I) and translocation factor (T II), from spleen supernatants revealed that immunized spleens contained both factors but control spleens were almost wholly deficient in T I. This data suggested that T I is a regulatory factor in controlling protein synthesis at translation. The difference noted between control and immunized particles does not imply structural or functional differences between them, but is probably due to their contamination with bound transfer factors and reflects a deficiency of T I in the control cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1663772093,"Abstract The toxin was isolated from the venom of sea snake, Lapemis hardwickii (Hardwick's sea snake), through a four-step purification by column chromatography. The toxin was proven homogenous by zonal electrophoresis, analytical ultra-centrifugation, and isoelectric focusing. The toxin was also isolated in crystal form. The lethality of the purified toxin increased 23-fold when compared to the original venom. The molecular weight as determined by amino acid composition and by sedimentation equilibrium was approximately 6800. The toxin consists of 61 amino acid residues and does not contain a free sulfhydryl group. End group analysis indicated that there is a histidine at the NH2-terminal and an aspartic acid or asparagine at the COOH-terminal.

https://openalex.org/W1622421831,"Abstract A three-subunit model is proposed to describe the subunit structure of 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase of Pseudomonas putida. The following data are consistent with three identical or nearly identical subunits per 72,000. (a) A limiting molecular weight of 24,000 was calculated from the amino acid analysis data based upon the presence of 1 histidine residue. (b) The numbers of peptides detected with specific reagents in peptide-mapping experiments were consistent with three identical subunits. (c) Three moles of carboxy-terminal asparagine were released by digestion of S-carboxymethyl-KDPG aldolase with carboxypeptidase A. (d) Four radioactive peptides were observed after alkylation of the 12 cysteine residues with 14C-iodoacetic acid, tryptic digestion, and column chromatography. (e) Three moles of 14C-pyruvate per mole of enzyme were bound by borohydride reduction. (f) A set of four hybrid species was detected by disc gel electrophoresis after dissociation and reassociation of mixtures of native and chemically modified KDPG aldolase. In addition, the molecular weight of the native aldolase determined by disc gel electrophoresis was in the range of 72,000 to 78,000, and the subunit molecular weight determined by disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate was 24,000 ± 500."
https://openalex.org/W143527142,"Four systems of the type, amino acid-sodium chloride-water, have been investigated over wide solute molality ranges using the isopiestic vapor pressure method. The amino acids used were glycine, β-alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and e-aminocaproic acid. Equations were obtained in terms of the molalities of the solutes for the activity coefficients of the amino acids in the salt solutions. The trace activity coefficients of the amino acids were all slightly negative at low salt molalities. At higher salt molalities, the trace activity coefficients for glycine and β-alanine remained negative whereas those for β-aminobutyric acid and e-aminocaproic acid became positive. The limiting interaction parameters were calculated for these systems using the Kirkwood ion-dipole expression and an empirical term for the salt effect on the nonpolar portion of the molecule. Good agreement was obtained between the calculated values and those determined experimentally."

https://openalex.org/W2058094762,"The rate of disappearance of intracisternally administered [(3)H]norepinephrine from rat brain gradually declines as a multiphasic exponential function of time. Conversion to [(3)H]normetanephrine accounts for a larger fraction of the [(3)H]norepinephrine released in the brain shortly after its intracisternal injection than that released at later times. Pools of norepinephrine in the brain thus appear to differ in their turnover rates and pathways of metabolism. The pool of norepinephrine with a rapid rate of turnover and an appreciable conversion to normetanephrine, identified by the techniques reported here, may correspond to a pool of newly synthesized norepinephrine in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1534656360,"Abstract The potency of inhibition of deoxyadenosine kinase by nucleotides of cytosine is dependent on the nature of the pentose moiety (deoxyribose g arabinose g ribose). Kinetic data suggest that deoxyadenosine (dAdo), deoxyguanosine (dGuo), and cytidine (Cyd) are substrates for dAdo kinase. The apparent Km values for these phosphate acceptors are: dAdo (0.7 mm), dGuo (1.1 mm), and Cyd (0.6 mm). The inhibition of deoxyadenosine kinase by dATP, dGTP, and dCTP appears to be noncompetitive with the phosphate acceptor and competitive with the phosphate donor (ATP). Kinetic analysis indicates that the reaction catalyzed by deoxyadenosine kinase follows a ping pong mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1591911690,"A particle-bound enzyme preparation from the fungus imperfectus Cryptococcus laurentii var. flavescens (NRRL Y-1401) catalyzes transfer of mannosyl units from GDP-mannose to mono- and oligosaccharide acceptors. Four separate enzymes can be differentiated by some or all of the following criteria: pH optimum, Km values for GDP-mannose, acceptor specificity, heat lability, metal ion requirement, and cross inhibition. These four enzymes catalyze the formation of four distinct mannosyl linkages, namely mannosyl-α-1,2-mannosyl (Enzyme I); mannosyl-α-1, 6-mannosyl (Enzyme II); mannosyl-α-1,3-mannosyl (Enzyme III); mannosyl-xylosyl (Enzyme IV). The occurrence of at least two of these linkages in cell wall heteropolysaccharides of C. laurentii suggests involvement of at least two, and possibly all four of these enzymes in cell wall biosynthesis of this organism."

https://openalex.org/W1510510119,"Abstract Some of the equilibrium and kinetic constants for the reactions of the isolated γ chains of human fetal hemoglobin have been determined. As was previously found for the isolated β chain of human hemoglobin A, these constants are very different for the γ chain with its sulfhydryl group combined with p-mercuribenzoate as compared to those for the γ chain with a free sulfhydryl group. Since the human γ chain contains a single sulfhydryl group at position 93, the alteration in the heme reactivity can be attributed to the chemical modification of that residue."
https://openalex.org/W1503575163,"Abstract It has been suggested that the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific substrates is described by a three-step mechanism: [see PDF for equation] and that for esters k23 is much greater than k34, and K's is greater than the steady state kinetic parameter Km(app). Steady state kinetic investigations do not allow one to determine the individual parameters for the mechanism shown above. This information can be obtained from pre-steady state kinetic investigations. In this paper we are reporting pre-steady state kinetic parameters, determined by stopped flow techniques, for the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolyses of the ethyl esters of N-acetyl-l-tyrosine, together with previously published data for the ethyl esters of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan and N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine. This allows a comparison of K's, k23, and k34 for the catalyzed hydrolyses of the esters of all three aromatic amino acids which are considered to be specific for chymotrypsin. Also included is an investigation of the presteady state kinetic parameters pertaining to the hydrolyses of N-acetyl-l-leucine methyl ester and of the methyl ester and amide of tosyl-l-arginine. N-Acetyl-l-leucine methyl ester was chosen because it allows an investigation of the pH dependence of k23, a study that is not possible with esters of aromatic acids, since in these reactions k23 becomes too large above pH 6 to be adequately measured by the stopped flow technique. The pH dependence of k23 was found to be similar to the pH dependence of k34. This information has not been available previously. p-Tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester and N-α-p-tosyl-l-argininamide were included because, as typical trypsin substrates that are hydrolyzed by chymotrypsin also, they are expected to offer some insight into the specificity of the reaction. Unlike in the chymotrypsin-catalyzed hydrolysis of specific substrate esters, the accumulation of an intermediate, such as EP2 in the above equation, could not be detected. One obvious explanation for this observation is that k23 rather than k34 is rate-limiting. It is shown that unproductive binding of the unspecific substrate can also account for the data."
https://openalex.org/W1874839597,"Abstract Analyses of l-valine[14C] incorporation into protein by guinea pig thyroid tissue slices show different numbers of sedimenting species depending on the temperatures used for sucrose gradient centrifugation. When analyzed at 23° the radioactive peaks which are observed correspond to native 19 S thyroglobulin and species sedimenting in the 3 to 8 S range. At 2°, the temperature generally used for sucrose gradient analysis, a new sedimenting component is observed with a rate near 15 S. This species is produced from 19 S as the temperature is reduced and appears to represent an unfolded form of 19 S. A rapid, reversible equilibrium exists between the 19 and 15 S species. Low iodine thyroglobulin, obtained from goitrogen-fed guinea pigs, showed temperature-dependent changes in sedimentation rates similar to those of newly synthesized protein. Thyroglobulin from normal animals, however, did not show any changes at low temperatures. Evidently 19 S becomes more refractory to low temperature unfolding with increasing levels of iodine. With standing at 2°, the 15 S species dissociates into 12 S subunits. When the temperature is raised to 23°, 19 S is reformed from the 12 S subunits. In contrast to the rates of the 19 S ⇌ 15 S reaction, which are faster than the time required for sucrose gradient analysis, the rates of the 15 S ⇌ 12 S reaction are slower. In addition to iodine, it was observed that ammonium sulfate affects the stability at low temperatures of newly synthesized or low iodine thyroglobulin. Ammonium sulfate precipitation was found to enhance the formation of 12 S."

https://openalex.org/W1574133516,"Abstract Treatment of Rana catesbeiana tadpoles with insulin results in activation of glycogen synthetase. Glycogen synthetase from insulin-treated animals has a lower Km for uridine diphosphoglucose and the nature of ATP inhibition is changed from cooperative to strictly competitive with substrate and with the activator, glucose 6-phosphate. A change in the mechanism of ATP inhibition from cooperative to strictly competitive with substrate and activator is also obtained by photo-oxidation of the untreated enzyme. Other properties of the insulin-activated and photo-oxidized enzymes are also similar: (a) cooperativity for glucose-6-P and UDP-glucose in the presence of ATP is no longer observed; (b) inhibition by ATP is more completely reversed by glucose-6-P in these enzymes compared with untreated glycogen synthetase. It is proposed that in the untreated enzyme ATP interacts with an allosteric regulatory site in addition to the UDP-glucose and glucose-6-P sites. Treatment with insulin in vivo or photo-oxidation in vitro abolishes the functional allosteric regulatory site for ATP without affecting the other ATP sites. It is not yet clear whether the insulin-mediated enzyme modification that results in a reduced Km for UDP-glucose is separate from that which inactivates the allosteric regulatory site for ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1589715820,"Abstract In rat liver slices, phosphorylcholine stimulates incorporation of radioactive leucine into the proteins recovered from microsomes and medium. In a cell-free microsomal system, prepared from rat liver, additions of phosphorylcholine plus cytidine 5'-triphosphate increased dramatically the incorporation of radioactive leucine or phenylalanine into hot trichloracetic acid-insoluble proteins. Such increased protein synthesis was evident even when the usual requirements of ATP, guanidine 5'-triphosphate, or pH 5 enzyme for protein synthesis were considerably reduced. Phosphorylcholine plus CTP did not stimulate radioactive leucine incorporation into leucyl-tRNA as measured by subtracting the radioactivity incorporated into heated trichloracetic acid-insoluble proteins from corresponding unheated samples. Incorporation of labeled phenylalanine from phenylalanyl-tRNA into microsomal proteins was increased by phosphorylcholine plus CTP. Cycloheximide and puromycin, at a concentration of 10-4 m, abolished the activation effect of phosphorylcholine plus CTP on protein synthesis. Microsomal proteins were solubilized at the end of incubation by sodium deoxycholate treatment or by ultrasonic oscillation. The stimulatory effect of phosphorylcholine plus CTP on the specific activity of the soluble proteins was 2-fold higher than on that of the insoluble proteins of the pellet. Incubation in the presence of phospholipase C, brief ultrasonic oscillation of microsomes prior to incubation, and aging of microsomes in frozen storage caused a partial reduction or complete inhibition of the effect of phosphorylcholine plus CTP on protein synthesis. Incorporation of a tracer dose of phosphoryl[1,2-14C]choline, in the presence of phosphorylcholine, CTP, or CTP plus phosphorylcholine, into the lecithin fraction was extremely rapid in the incubation system normally used for studying protein synthesis. In stimulating protein synthesis, CTP could be replaced by uridine 5'-triphosphate, cytidine 5'-diphosphate, and cytidine 5'-phosphate, and these nucleotides, except UTP, also activated phosphorylcholine incorporation into lecithin. The different effect of UTP on phosphorylcholine incorporation into lecithin and on protein synthesis argues against a simple causal relationship between lecithin and protein synthesis. However, the results presented raise the possibility of a relationship between phosphorylcholine metabolism and protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W116351894,"Abstract The equilibria and the kinetics of reactions of human with ligands have been studied over a large range of protein concentration in the presence of triethylamine hydrochloride, which favors dissociation of into subunits. The extent of dissociation was determined by ultracentrifuge measurements on the same solutions. The results show that: (a) the oxygen equilibrium of changes only slightly as the triethylamine hydrochloride concentration is increased up to 4 m; specifically, ligand binding is still strongly cooperative even at low protein concentration, at which sedimentation data indicate a large dissociation of the deoxy derivative into dimers and of the oxy one into monomers; (b) the kinetic behavior of in rapid mixing experiments does not change in 2 m triethylamine hydrochloride in respect to normal conditions; (c) the quickly reacting hemoglobin in flash photolysis experiments is not correlated in any simple way with the fraction of dimers nor is it entirely restricted to monomers. The results lead once again to the conclusion that the free αβ dimers show all the characteristic features of ligand binding to and indicate that even in the tetramer they may represent the fundamental unit of function."
https://openalex.org/W1500401224,"Abstract The structural model of yeast enolase has undergone substantial modification in recent years, and the quantitative end group analysis of the enzyme was undertaken as a means of establishing the most recent two-subunit model by a chemical method. Carboxypeptidase digestion and hydrazinolysis gave 1.95 and 1.85 moles, respectively, of carboxyl-terminal leucine per mole of enzyme, and amino-terminal analysis by the cyanate method gave 1.8 moles of amino-terminal alanine per mole of enzyme, thus confirming the model of yeast enolase as an 88,000-dalton protein consisting of two 44,000-dalton subunits. Contrary to reports in the literature, pure enolase was found to be very resistant to endopeptidase-free exopeptidase digestion. The earlier findings that large segments of both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences can be removed by exopeptidases without loss of enolase activity can thus not be reproduced in this laboratory. Some possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed."
