https://openalex.org/W2010840460,"IN preparative ion-exchange chromatography or electrophoresis of mixtures of low-molecular non-volatile compounds, it is essential to use buffer salts that are easily removed. Many methods have been employed or proposed for desalting. Of these, only evaporation of the buffer can, in our opinion, be considered as entirely satisfactory, since it introduces no other operation than the one required for the removal of the solvent. The number of volatile buffers in use so far is much limited, and those buffers do not meet all demands."

https://openalex.org/W2073027709,"THE formation of hyaluronate by strains of Lancefield Group A and C streptococci growing in ordinary laboratory media was first shown by Kendall, Heidelberger and Dawson1 and by Seastone2. More recently, it has been demonstrated3 that the glucosamine and glucuronic acid moieties of hyaluronate are formed from glucose by cultures of these microorganisms, without rearrangement of the carbon skeleton."

https://openalex.org/W2051670596,"IT has recently been suggested that a new sandfly of termitaries, provisionally designated Phlebotomus (Sergentomyia) sp. nov. 2, may be the vector of an outbreak of kala-azar in Kenya Colony which has involved more than three thousand Africans1. Not only does the sandfly bite man, but also it is widely distributed throughout the epidemic area, and a small proportion are naturally infected with leptomonads in the anterior part of the mid-gut."

https://openalex.org/W1985352449,"SENIOR-WHITE1 has suggested a most convenient system of classification for the adult behaviour of anopheline mosquitoes, especially the vectors of malaria. The classification is of considerable importance when assessing the vectorial capacity of Anopheles gambiae, which ought now to be regarded as a mosquito the behaviour of which is considerably plastic; it certainly is not “a vector wherever found”. Under the environmental conditions of an oceanic island, such as Mauritius, A. gambiae appears to lose its addiction for man. It may be that when it first made its appearance in the island in the 1860's its full genetical complex was missing. Again, there is a suggestion of a behaviour cline, A. gambiae becoming less and less closely associated with man as its distribution recedes from the equatorial regions."

In the present communication, it will be shown that the melanin of the ox-choroid is identical with that of black human hair, while red human hair contains a pigment related to, but not identical with, these melanins."

https://openalex.org/W2012632960,"IT has been reported1 that hide collagen and other proteins dissolve in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The fact that some proteins, like insulin, were recovered with up to 80 per cent of their initial biological activity, after solution in this solvent, suggested that collagen might dissolve without denaturation. The ability to reconstitute characteristic collagen fibrils from solution was used as the criterion of the absence of denaturation."

Among the methods employed are : skin-painting, subcutaneous injection, intra-peritoneal administration as well as injection into the amniotic fluid of mice. The findings reported here are based on observations by another method which has been employed as part of an investigation for determining the strain specificity of certain endocrine organs of mice of the C57 (black), the Strong A and the C3H (Bar) strains of mice. The results which were obtained are striking enough to deserve wider notice even at this stage."
