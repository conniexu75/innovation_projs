https://openalex.org/W2053039168,"Acquisition of the intestinal microbiota begins at birth, and a stable microbial community develops from a succession of key organisms. Disruption of the microbiota during maturation by low-dose antibiotic exposure can alter host metabolism and adiposity. We now show that low-dose penicillin (LDP), delivered from birth, induces metabolic alterations and affects ileal expression of genes involved in immunity. LDP that is limited to early life transiently perturbs the microbiota, which is sufficient to induce sustained effects on body composition, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host metabolic effects. In addition, LDP enhances the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity. The growth promotion phenotype is transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, showing that the altered microbiota, not antibiotics per se, play a causal role. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations. PAPERCLIP:"

Analyzing expression data from 56 published reports, we found that cells derived via directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo counterparts than products of direct conversion, as reflected by the establishment of target cell-type gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Furthermore, we discovered that directly converted cells fail to adequately silence expression programs of the starting population and that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm.

Transitions between cellular states are fundamental to development, physiology, and pathology. Directing state transitions in vitro is a current preoccupation of stem cell biology, as the derived cells can be used to investigate otherwise inaccessible cell types in development and disease, for drug screening, and for regenerative cell therapies. Dramatic cell-state transitions have been achieved in vitro and in vivo through the enforced expression of transcription factors. For example, differentiated somatic cells—fibroblasts (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

Furthermore, pluripotent stem cells can be coaxed to specific lineages through a combination of defined growth conditions and ectopic gene expression (Murry and Keller, 2008Murry C.E. Keller G.

The widespread practice of cellular engineering has raised critical questions about the relationship of the derived cells to their native counterparts. To what extent does a cell population engineered in vitro resemble the corresponding target cell or tissue in both molecular and functional terms? While functional complementation via transplantation in live animals has been used to assess the ability of engineered cells to mimic the physiology of their native counterparts, such experiments are technically challenging, lack quantitative rigor, and provide limited insights when judging human tissue function in animal hosts. The molecular similarity of engineered populations is typically assessed by semiquantitative PCR, array-based expression profiling, or RNA sequencing followed by simple clustering analysis. However, such global analyses do not provide an intuitive or a quantitative means for diagnosing the deficiencies of engineered cells, nor do they provide a systematic approach to prioritize interventions to improve derivations of the desired populations. Here, we provide a network biology platform, CellNet, which assesses the fidelity of cell fate conversions and generates specific hypotheses aimed at improving derived cell populations. Our platform includes both novel and previously described components, which we outline below. We describe the construction of this platform for human and mouse cell and tissue types and use it to assess the results of 56 published attempts at reprogramming to pluripotency (most of which use the canonical reprogramming factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc), directed differentiation, and direct conversion of somatic cells. On the basis of these analyses, we have documented quantitatively that reprogramming is the most complete and successful of the various cell fate conversions; indeed, CellNet confirms that iPSC are virtually indistinguishable from ES cells in their faithful establishment of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Further, we show that neurons and cardiomyocytes derived by directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells more completely establish the target tissue- and cell-type GRNs than do neurons and cardiomyocytes directly converted from fibroblasts. Moreover, analysis of cardiomyocytes converted from cardiac fibroblasts in situ demonstrates that the in vivo environment provides selective and/or inductive signals that more completely establish heart GRNs. We also demonstrate that GRNs of the starting cell type are detectable in purified populations of both directed differentiation and in direct conversion experiments, and we show that the establishment of unintended GRNs is common to virtually every cellular engineering paradigm. Thus CellNet provides a platform for assessing and improving efforts at cellular engineering. CellNet is predicated on the discovery of GRNs, which govern the steady-state expression program of a particular cell type as well as its transcriptional responses to environment, disease, and age. GRNs thus act as major molecular determinants of cell-type identity (Davidson and Erwin, 2006Davidson E.H. Erwin D.H. Gene regulatory networks and the evolution of animal body plans.Science. 2006; 311: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). We reasoned that measuring the establishment of cell and tissue (C/T)-specific GRNs in engineered populations would serve as both a robust metric of cellular identity and a tool to identify aberrant regulatory nodes. We designed CellNet to query gene expression profiles for the extent to which C/T GRNs are established, to classify input samples by their similarity to target cells and tissues, and to score transcriptional regulators according to their likelihood of improving the engineered population (Figure 1A). In the ideal case, a comprehensive catalog of GRNs would be available from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) for all cell types and all transcription factors, and GRN establishment in engineered cells would be quantified by comparing their global transcription factor binding profiles to the reference set. Such data are currently unavailable, but over the past decade methods to reconstruct GRNs using genome-wide expression data have matured substantially (Marbach et al., 2012Marbach D. Costello J.C. Küffner R. Vega N.M. Prill R.J. Camacho D.M. Allison K.R. Kellis M. Collins J.J. Stolovitzky G. DREAM5 ConsortiumWisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar), and expression repositories have accumulated a wide array of biological perturbations (Lukk et al., 2010Lukk M. Kapushesky M. Nikkilä J. Parkinson H. Goncalves A. Huber W. Ukkonen E. Brazma A. A global map of human gene expression.Nat. Biotechnol. 2010; 28: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Rung and Brazma, 2013Rung J. Brazma A. Reuse of public genome-wide gene expression data.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2013; 14: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), which are needed for accurate GRN reconstruction. We developed a pipeline to reconstruct GRNs using 3,419 publicly available gene expression profiles of diverse cell types and tissues, including embryonic stem cells, ovary, testis, neurons, glia, skin, heart, skeletal muscle, fibroblasts, white adipose, kidney, endothelial cells, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), B cells, T cells, macrophages, lung, liver, pancreas, small intestine, and colon (Figure 1B). We used the Affymetrix 430.2 and the HG133 plus 2 platforms to reconstruct mouse and human GRNs, respectively, because at present they represent the most comprehensive data set of cells and tissues and network perturbations. We performed a census of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to determine the number of arrays that profiled well-annotated cell and tissue types. We found 20 mouse cell and tissue types that were represented by at least 100 expression profiles and 16 human cell and tissue types represented by at least 60 profiles (Table S1), as the performance of GRNs reconstructed from fewer than 60 profiles degrades substantially (Faith et al., 2007Faith J.J. Hayete B. Thaden J.T. Mogno I. Wierzbowski J. Cottarel G. Kasif S. Collins J.J. Gardner T.S. Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). To reconstruct GRNs, we first randomly selected an equivalent number of profiles from each GEO accession and each C/T, ensuring that each C/T was represented by a minimum of ten distinct conditions, which act as perturbations that enable GRN reconstruction. After integrating these samples into a single data set, we reconstructed GRNs using a modified version of the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, which uses a context-specific measure of correlation significance to infer direct regulatory relationships between transcriptional regulators and target genes (Faith et al., 2007Faith J.J. Hayete B. Thaden J.T. Mogno I. Wierzbowski J. Cottarel G. Kasif S. Collins J.J. Gardner T.S. Large-scale mapping and validation of Escherichia coli transcriptional regulation from a compendium of expression profiles.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). We first applied CLR to the complete data set to find regulatory relationships that span most tissues and cell types. Then, we used CLR to find regulatory relationships that are specific to cell and tissue types of common developmental origins, relationships that can be obscured when reconstructing GRNs from all C/Ts simultaneously (Novershtern et al., 2011Novershtern N. Subramanian A. Lawton L.N. Mak R.H. Haining W.N. McConkey M.E. Habib N. Yosef N. Chang C.Y. Shay T. et al.Densely interconnected transcriptional circuits control cell states in human hematopoiesis.Cell. 2011; 144: 296-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Then we combined the results into a single GRN per cell and tissue type. We then assessed the accuracy of regulatory relationships predicted by GRN reconstruction by comparison to three gold standards. The first was based on ENCODE-generated transcription factor binding data (Mouse ENCODE Consortium et al., 2012Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Snyder M. Hardison R. Ren B. Gingeras T. Gilbert D.M.

Jakt L.M. Era T. Embryonic stem-cell culture as a tool for developmental cell biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the third on ChIP-ChIP and ChIP-seq of 54 transcription factors in mESC (Xu et al., 2013Xu H. Baroukh C. Dannenfelser R. Chen E.Y. Tan C.M. Kou Y. Kim Y.E. Lemischka I.R. Ma’ayan A.

Med. 2010; 2: 52ra73Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The ability of our GRNs to predict true regulatory relationships, defined by ChIP-seq/ChIP-seq TF-binding sites, or by the genes that change in expression upon transcription factor gain or loss-of-expression, was as good or better than the state-of-the-art reported in a recent meta-analysis of algorithms for GRN reconstruction (Marbach et al., 2012Marbach D. Costello J.C. Küffner R. Vega N.M. Prill R.J. Camacho D.M. Allison K.R. Kellis M. Collins J.J. Stolovitzky G. DREAM5 ConsortiumWisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 796-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) (Figure S1 available online). This result demonstrates that merging gene expression profiles from disparate experimental contexts yields high quality biological models, likely due to the wide diversity of perturbations to the underlying GRNs, regardless of the potential confounding batch effects common to microarray experiments. Then, we used the Gold Standards to select a threshold of strongly predicted regulatory relationships, resulting in 717,140 putative regulatory relationships among 20,722 target genes and 1,268 transcriptional regulators in mouse GRNs, and 536,897 putative regulatory relationships among 20,084 target genes and 1,566 transcriptional regulators in human GRNs. We have made the complete set of regulatory relationships that define these GRNs available for download at our companion website. Next, we sought to define components of the GRN that are cell and tissue specific. Complex networks are comprised of communities or subnetworks in which some nodes (i.e., genes) are more densely interconnected to each other than to nodes in other subnetworks. Applying the InfoMap community-detection algorithm (Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2007Rosvall M. Bergstrom C.T. An information-theoretic framework for resolving community structure in complex networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 7327-7331Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), we found 1,787 mouse and 2,315 human subnetworks in our GRNs. By performing gene set enrichment analysis (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007Efron B. Tibshirani R. On testing the significance of sets of genes.Ann. Appl. Stat. 2007; 1: 107-129Crossref Google Scholar), we found that 94 mouse and 76 human subnetworks were enriched in genes more highly expressed in a C/T (Figure 1B) and as expected, these subnetworks were highly enriched in Gene Ontology Biological Processes associated with specific cells or tissues (Table S2). For simplicity, we combined the subnetworks associated with each C/T into one general GRN per C/T and used these general GRNs except when stated below (Table S3). For each C/T, we trained a binary classifier by using all of the genes in each C/T GRN in a randomly selected subset of the overall training data. To assess the performance of the classifiers, we applied the classifiers to an independent set of arrays and calculated the sensitivity and false positive rate. The classifiers performed well, reaching close to 100% sensitivity at false positive rates ≤5% for all target C/Ts (Figure 1C and Figures S1E–S1H). Clustering is the most commonly used approach to determine relationships among samples based on expression profiling. To determine whether CellNet was better at classification than clustering, we also applied clustering to the validation data sets. At sensitivities greater than 63%, CellNet had substantially superior precision, defined as the proportion of classifications that are correct (Figure 1D). At sensitivities greater than 90%, CellNet achieved close to 100% precision. On the other hand, at these same sensitivities, clustering classifications were less than 25% precise, meaning that most of the calls made at this threshold by clustering were false positives. Our analysis implies that claims of cell engineering fidelity based on clustering alone can convey false impressions of similarity when indeed quite significant differences persist. To help identify which subnetworks fail to be established or are aberrantly established in engineered cells, we devised a metric of GRN status given an expression profile (Figure 1E) that integrates the closeness of the expression of each gene in a GRN to its expected value, weighted by its importance to the network and its importance in the associated C/T classifier. Finally, to help prioritize transcriptional regulators for the improvement of cellular engineering, we devised a network influence score that integrates the expression level of the regulator in the target C/T, the extent of dysregulation of the regulator and its predicted targets in the query sample, and the number of predicted targets (Figure 1F). We have made CellNet available as a web application (http://cellnet.hms.harvard.edu) where visitors can explore the GRNs, download our software to run locally, or upload expression data to be processed on our servers. We anticipated that the C/T type classifier might be limited in two aspects. First, tissues represent heterogeneous populations, whereas the goal of stem cell engineering is often the production of a highly pure preparation of a specific cell type. Second, the vast majority of our training data were derived from primary cells and tissues, whereas most attempts at engineering cell populations are performed in vitro. To address how tissue heterogeneity influences CellNet performance, we applied CellNet to primary neonatal cardiomyocytes purified on the basis of a reporter for alpha myosin heavy chain (aMHC) expression (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.-D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by defined factors.Cell. 2010; 142: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), to nociceptor neurons dissected and purified based on Nav1.8 expression (Chiu et al., 2013Chiu I.M. Heesters B.A. Ghasemlou N. Von Hehn C.A. Zhao F. Tran J. Wainger B. Strominger A. Muralidharan S. Horswill A.R. et al.Bacteria activate sensory neurons that modulate pain and inflammation.Nature. 2013; 501: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), and to laser capture microdissected (LCM) human dopaminergic neurons (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng B. Liao Z. Locascio J.J. Lesniak K.A. Roderick S.S. Watt M.L. Eklund A.C. Zhang-James Y. Kim P.D. Hauser M.A. et al.Global PD Gene Expression (GPEX) ConsortiumPGC-1α, a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in Parkinson’s disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2010; 2: 52ra73Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Purified mouse cardiomyocytes classified exclusively as heart (Figure 2A) and reached greater than 90% heart GRN status (Figure 2B). Heart tissue includes fibroblasts, endocardium, neural, and vascular tissue in addition to cardiac muscle cells, but despite the heterogeneous nature of the heart training data, our classifier accurately determined the tissue of origin for purified cardiomyocytes. This analysis also explains why tissues like skeletal muscle, which shares functional features with heart (e.g., myosin-based contraction), and lung, which shares cell compositional features with the heart (e.g., substantial endothelial cell contributions), show higher heart GRN establishment levels than other cell types and tissues, because some members of the heart GRN are shared by skeletal muscle and endothelial cells (Figure 2B). When we applied CellNet to purified pain receptor neurons, we found that they classified exclusively as generic neurons (Figure 2C) (score = 0.792) and achieved a high neuron GRN status (mean = 91.6%) (Figure 2D). Finally, when we applied CellNet to LCM human dopaminergic neurons, we found that they classified highly as neurons (mean score = 0.887) (Figure 2E) and reached a high neuron GRN establishment (mean GRN status = 98.5%) (Figure 2F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that despite cell composition heterogeneity in the training data, CellNet is able to accurately classify specific cell types according to the tissue from which they are derived. To address how the effects of cell culture influence the performance of CellNet, we analyzed the expression profiles of cortical neurons (Peng et al., 2012Peng Z.F. Chen M.J. Manikandan J. Melendez A.J. Shui G. Russo-Marie F. Whiteman M. Beart P.M. Moore P.K. Cheung N.S.

Med. 2012; 16: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and hepatocytes (Mao et al., 2011Mao T. Shao M. Qiu Y. Huang J. Zhang Y. Song B. Wang Q. Jiang L. Liu Y. Han J.-D.J. et al.PKA phosphorylation couples hepatic inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha to glucagon signaling in glucose metabolism.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 15852-15857Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that had been cultured in vitro prior to RNA extraction. We found that primary hepatocytes cultured for 3 days classified exclusively as liver (Figure 2G) and maintained a high liver GRN status (Figure 2H). Predictably, however, as a consequence of the known dedifferentiation of hepatocytes in culture (Strain, 1994Strain A.J. Isolated hepatocytes: use in experimental and clinical hepatology.Gut. 1994; 35: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), CellNet noted a modest decrease in the classification between 48 and 72 hr, which is reflected in decreased expression of mature hepatocyte markers (Figure S2). Similarly, neurons cultured for 8 days retained high neuron classification (mean = 0.870) and a high neuron GRN status (Figures 2I and 2J). The cultured neurons classified secondarily as glial cells (mean score = 0.325), consistent with a minor glia contamination in the cultured cells. The classifications did not substantially diminish for up to 8 days of culture, demonstrating that despite the dedifferentiation effects of cell culture, CellNet is sufficiently sensitive to detect the resident neural GRN. These results suggest that gene expression changes induced by cell culture, while modestly reducing the classification score, are not sufficient to abolish the classification of the primary cell type. To assess the relative fidelity of directed differentiation and direct conversion to neural cells types, we applied CellNet to engineered mouse neurons. To make the comparison between the two engineering paradigms as fair as possible, we focused our analysis on engineered cell populations that had the best target C/T classification among published examples, as these represent what is optimally possible to date (see Table S4 for list of all experiments analyzed and Table S5 for target C/T classifications). The ESC-derived cells (Arnold et al., 2013Arnold P. Schöler A. Pachkov M. Balwierz P.J. Jørgensen H. Stadler M.B. van Nimwegen E. Schübeler D. Modeling of epigenome dynamics identifies transcription factors that mediate Polycomb targeting.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) achieved a high neuron classification (score = 0.773; Figure 3A), with high fidelity for both the silencing of the ESC GRN and the establishment of the neuron GRN (Figure 3B). Indeed, neurons directly differentiated from ESCs were nearly indistinguishable from native neuronal populations, further arguing that in vitro derived populations can be effectively classified against training data derived primarily from primary tissues. The CellNet platform can be interrogated to test specific mechanistic hypotheses about what limits the robustness of cell fate conversions. For instance, we hypothesized that chromatin accessibility would dictate the fidelity of establishment of lineage-specific gene sets. We first mapped DNase hypersensitivity data from the Mouse ENCODE project to the promoters of genes that are more highly expressed in neural cells than in ESCs (i.e., “neural genes”) (Mouse ENCODE Consortium et al., 2012Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Snyder M. Hardison R. Ren B. Gingeras T. Gilbert D.M. Groudine M. Bender M. Kaul R. Canfield T. et al.Mouse ENCODE ConsortiumAn encyclopedia of mouse DNA elements (Mouse ENCODE).Genome Biol. 2012; 13: 418Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Then we asked whether the expression of neural genes with accessible promoters was more effectively established in ESC-derived neurons than neural genes with inaccessible promoters (Figure 3C). As predicted, we found that expression patterns for neural genes with accessible promoters in the ESC state were more readily established and closer to native neural populations than were genes lacking DNase hypersensitivity. This result indicates greater dysregulation for occluded promoters and implies that additional cu"
https://openalex.org/W2133660324,"Molecular motors in cells typically produce highly directed motion; however, the aggregate, incoherent effect of all active processes also creates randomly fluctuating forces, which drive diffusive-like, nonthermal motion. Here, we introduce force-spectrum-microscopy (FSM) to directly quantify random forces within the cytoplasm of cells and thereby probe stochastic motor activity. This technique combines measurements of the random motion of probe particles with independent micromechanical measurements of the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of force fluctuations. Using FSM, we show that force fluctuations substantially enhance intracellular movement of small and large components. The fluctuations are three times larger in malignant cells than in their benign counterparts. We further demonstrate that vimentin acts globally to anchor organelles against randomly fluctuating forces in the cytoplasm, with no effect on their magnitude. Thus, FSM has broad applications for understanding the cytoplasm and its intracellular processes in relation to cell physiology in healthy and diseased states."

Using the technique of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, they confirm a hypothesis that all four Mn ions are octahedrally coordinated and in the 4+ oxidation state.

https://openalex.org/W2121659981,"Distal enhancers commonly contact target promoters via chromatin looping. In erythroid cells, the locus control region (LCR) contacts β-type globin genes in a developmental stage-specific manner to stimulate transcription. Previously, we induced LCR-promoter looping by tethering the self-association domain (SA) of Ldb1 to the β-globin promoter via artificial zinc fingers. Here, we show that targeting the SA to a developmentally silenced embryonic globin gene in adult murine erythroblasts triggers its transcriptional reactivation. This activity depends on the LCR, consistent with an LCR-promoter looping mechanism. Strikingly, targeting the SA to the fetal γ-globin promoter in primary adult human erythroblasts increases γ-globin promoter-LCR contacts, stimulating transcription to approximately 85% of total β-globin synthesis, with a reciprocal reduction in adult β-globin expression. Our findings demonstrate that forced chromatin looping can override a stringent developmental gene expression program and suggest a novel approach to control the balance of globin gene transcription for therapeutic applications."

Does this mucus accumulate because there is a defect in the way it is produced? Or does it accumulate because of other disease features, such as dehydration or airway wall remodeling? Distinguishing between these possibilities is important for future drug development. In a study of piglets with cystic fibrosis, Hoegger et al. identify mucus production as the primary defect (see the Perspective by Wine). The airway glands of the piglets synthesized strands of mucus normally, but the strands were never released and stayed tethered to the gland ducts. Science , this issue p. 818 ; see also p. 730"
https://openalex.org/W2149304739,"Genetically unstable tetraploid cells can promote tumorigenesis. Recent estimates suggest that ∼37% of human tumors have undergone a genome-doubling event during their development. This potentially oncogenic effect of tetraploidy is countered by a p53-dependent barrier to proliferation. However, the cellular defects and corresponding signaling pathways that trigger growth suppression in tetraploid cells are not known. Here, we combine RNAi screening and in vitro evolution approaches to demonstrate that cytokinesis failure activates the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in cultured cells, as well as in naturally occurring tetraploid cells in vivo. Induction of the Hippo pathway is triggered in part by extra centrosomes, which alter small G protein signaling and activate LATS2 kinase. LATS2 in turn stabilizes p53 and inhibits the transcriptional regulators YAP and TAZ. These findings define an important tumor suppression mechanism and uncover adaptive mechanisms potentially available to nascent tumor cells that bypass this inhibitory regulation."

The described mechanism may represent a general principle of the inheritance of differentiated cell states. Differentiated somatic cells exhibit distinct functions and behaviors that are specified by their developmental programs. In the past two decades, tremendous progress has been achieved in elucidating genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying differentiation of specialized cell lineages and organ development. However, little is known about how, and to what degree, the differentiated cells maintain their fate or lose their identity in response to changing environment or upon cell division, the two conditions that may disturb the inheritance of lineage-specifying factors (Sánchez Alvarado and Yamanaka, 2014Sánchez Alvarado A. Yamanaka S. Rethinking differentiation: stem cells, regeneration, and plasticity.Cell. 2014; 157: 110-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Consequently, factors that affect identity and function of a given cell type and molecular basis of their robustness upon environmental perturbations and its biological significance remain poorly understood. The adaptive immune system with its somatic diversification of antigen receptors of essentially unlimited specificity affords vertebrates with an effective means of defense against previously encountered and new infectious agents. Potentially deleterious self-reactivity and “collateral” damage resulting in an impairment or loss of tissue function has been a tradeoff for the emergence of adaptive immunity. Central to limiting excessive immune responses and associated inflammation is their suppression mediated by regulatory T (Treg) cells, a subset of CD4+ T cells expressing X-chromosome-encoded transcription factor Foxp3. Foxp3 is specifically expressed in Treg cells and plays a key role in their differentiation and function (Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z. Lu L.F. Rudensky A.Y. Regulatory T cells: mechanisms of differentiation and function.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 531-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). During the differentiation of Treg cells, Foxp3 is induced in response to TCR and IL-2 signaling (Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z. Lu L.F. Rudensky A.Y.

In addition to conferring cellular identity and functional competence during differentiation of Treg cells, Foxp3 plays an essential role in their maintenance because deletion of a conditional Foxp3 allele in differentiated Treg cells results in a loss of their function (Williams and Rudensky, 2007Williams L.M. Rudensky A.Y. Maintenance of the Foxp3-dependent developmental program in mature regulatory T cells requires continued expression of Foxp3.Nat.

Genetic fate mapping using inducible and constitutive Cre revealed heritable and stable Foxp3 expression in the Treg cell population in unchallenged mice as well as in the context of infection and autoimmune inflammation (Miyao et al., 2012Miyao T.

In contrast, almost half of newly generated extrathymic Treg cells lose Foxp3 expression (Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z. Lu L.F. Rudensky A.Y. Regulatory T cells: mechanisms of differentiation and function.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 531-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). Thus, Treg cells represent a distinct cell lineage and Foxp3 is its late acting specification factor whose stable expression is a requisite for preserving Treg cell identity and functional integrity. These findings also implied the existence of a distinct mechanism that ensures Treg cell lineage stability. A conserved intronic regulatory element CNS2 is required for the maintenance of Foxp3 expression in the progeny of dividing Treg cells but does not affect Foxp3 induction and its amount on a per cell basis (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng Y.

Despite a considerable body of work, the biological role of CNS2 in the regulation of Foxp3 expression has not been elucidated, and a mechanistic understanding of CNS2 function and its biological role are lacking. Here, we demonstrated that CNS2 serves as a sensor of IL-2/STAT5 signaling that prevents Treg conversion into effector T cells upon exposure to proinflammatory cytokines. CNS2 conferred stable inheritance of Foxp3 expression at limiting amounts of IL-2, which was of particular significance for control of chronic inflammation in a wide range of biological contexts. Lymphopenic or proinflammatory conditions are associated with the instability of Treg cells; however, its cause and consequences have not been examined (Bailey-Bucktrout et al., 2013Bailey-Bucktrout S.L. Martinez-Llordella M. Zhou X. Anthony B. Rosenthal W. Luche H. Fehling H.J. Bluestone J.A.

Med. 2013; 20: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). We observed accumulation of Foxp3− cells (exTreg) upon Treg cell division in response to TCR stimulation in vitro. This was unlikely due to the contamination with effector T cells because the starting population contained 99.8% Foxp3+ cells (Figure 1A and data not shown). To demonstrate that the loss of Foxp3 was due to division of Treg cells, we blocked cell-cycle progression using pharmacological inhibitors targeting different stages of the cell cycle. The cell-cycle blockade fully rescued Foxp3 expression (Figure 1B), suggesting that its loss was indeed cell-cycle dependent. To investigate whether CpG methylation (mCpG) plays a role in the regulation of heritable Foxp3 expression, we examined the mCpG levels across the Foxp3 locus by bisulfite sequencing in resting and dividing Treg cells as compared to non-Treg cells that do not express Foxp3 or “exTreg” cells that have lost Foxp3 expression either in vitro or in vivo. In agreement with previous reports, −1.5 kb, CNS2, and exon −1 were methylated in non-Treg cells and were largely or fully demethylated in Treg cells (Floess et al., 2007Floess S. Freyer J. Siewert C. Baron U. Olek S. Polansky J. Schlawe K. Chang H.D. Bopp T. Schmitt E. et al.Epigenetic control of the foxp3 locus in regulatory T cells.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e38Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, Ohkura et al., 2012Ohkura N. Hamaguchi M. Morikawa H. Sugimura K. Tanaka A. Ito Y. Osaki M. Tanaka Y. Yamashita R.

Importantly, we found a statistically significant increase in mCpG at sites including the −1.5 kb region, CNS2, and exon-1 in dividing Foxp3+ Treg cells (Figure 1C and Figures S1A–S1C available online). Accordingly, low dose of a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) prevented loss of Foxp3 expression in Treg cells that underwent a comparable number of cell divisions in the presence or absence of the drug (Figure S1D). These findings suggest that CpG methylation might be actively regulated when Treg cells divide and may affect the heritability of Foxp3 expression. Studies of Foxp3ΔCNS2-gfp mice on a mixed genetic background showed that CNS2 maintains Foxp3 expression in Treg cells (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng Y. Josefowicz S. Chaudhry A. Peng X.P. Forbush K. Rudensky A.Y. Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Nature. 2010; 463: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To explore the biological role of CNS2 and the molecular mechanisms of its function in depth, we backcrossed Foxp3ΔCNS2-gfp mice onto a C57BL/6 (B6) background (n > 10) and bred them to CNS2-sufficient Foxp3gfp B6 mice expressing the exact same Foxp3 reporter allele, which serves as an ideal control when segregated into male littermates (Bettini et al., 2012Bettini M.L.

In agreement with previous results on a mixed genetic background (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng Y. Josefowicz S. Chaudhry A. Peng X.P. Forbush K. Rudensky A.Y. Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Nature. 2010; 463: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), significantly more Treg cells isolated from Foxp3ΔCNS2-gfp B6 mice with the germline CNS2 deficiency lost Foxp3 expression upon division in comparison to CNS2-sufficient Foxp3gfp B6 littermates (Figure 1D). To exclude a possibility that CNS2 may have a direct impact on the expression of genes other than Foxp3 through long-range chromatin interactions that could contribute to impaired Foxp3 maintenance, we performed RNA-seq gene expression analysis of CNS2-sufficient and -deficient resting Treg cells. Comparable gene expression observed in these CNS2-sufficient and -deficient Treg cell populations (Figure 1E) indicated that CNS2 has a direct and specific role in the maintenance of Foxp3 expression and Treg cell fate in dividing activated Treg cells. These findings raised the question of at which stage of Treg cell differentiation CNS2 exerts its function. To address this, we deleted a conditional CNS2fl allele in mature Treg cells. Treg cells expressing Foxp3gfp reporter that underwent tamoxifen-induced Cre-ER (UBCCre-ERT2)-mediated CNS2 deletion were tagged by YFP through the concomitant activation of R26Y recombination reporter allele (Figure 1F). YFP expression was highly correlated with CNS2 deletion, with only 4.7% ± 0.6% YFP-tagged cells retaining the unrecombined allele as measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (data not shown). To test the role of CNS2 in the maintenance of Foxp3 expression in mature Treg cells in vivo, we transferred highly purified YFP+GFP+ Treg cells (>99.8% purity) from Foxp3CNS2fl-gfp UBCCre-ERT2 R26Y mice into T-cell-deficient Tcrb−/−Tcrd−/− recipients together with allelically marked naive Ly5.1+ CD4+Foxp3− T cells and assessed Foxp3 expression 7 weeks after transfer. Because ∼50% GFP+YFP−Treg cells in tamoxifen-treated Foxp3CNS2fl-gfp UBCCre-ERT2 R26Y mice lost CNS2 and the R26Y underreported recombination at the Foxp3 locus (data not shown), we used YFP−GFP+ Treg cells sorted from untreated Foxp3CNS2fl-gfp UBCCre-ERT2 R26Y mice or from tamoxifen-treated Foxp3CNS2fl-gfp R26Y mice as negative controls. Consistent with our previous findings, only a minor portion of control Treg cells lost Foxp3 expression when analyzed 7 weeks after transfer (Figures 1G, S1E, and S1F) (Rubtsov et al., 2010Rubtsov Y.P. Niec R.E. Josefowicz S. Li L. Darce J. Mathis D. Benoist C. Rudensky A.Y. Stability of the regulatory T cell lineage in vivo.Science. 2010; 329: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In contrast, >55% of the progeny of Treg cells subjected to acute CNS2 ablation lost Foxp3 expression. Because we transferred the majority of Treg cells with unrecombined CNS2fl and the minority with ablated CNS2fl cells, or control Foxp3gfp cells, the experimental and control groups of recipient mice remained healthy. Thus, CNS2 maintains Foxp3 expression in mature Treg cells. The observation that only some mature Treg cells lost Foxp3 expression raised a question of whether the Treg cell population is heterogeneous in its reliance on CNS2 for Foxp3 maintenance, with subsets of cells being dependent or independent of CNS2. It was possible, for example, that the loss of CNS2 affected only CD25low Treg cells prone to Foxp3 loss (Komatsu et al., 2009Komatsu N. Mariotti-Ferrandiz M.E. Wang Y. Malissen B. Waldmann H. Hori S. Heterogeneity of natural Foxp3+ T cells: a committed regulatory T-cell lineage and an uncommitted minor population retaining plasticity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, Komatsu et al., 2013Komatsu N. Okamoto K. Sawa S. Nakashima T. Oh-Hora M. Kodama T. Tanaka S. Bluestone J.A. Takayanagi H. Pathogenic conversion of Foxp3 T cells into T17 cells in autoimmune arthritis.Nat. Med. 2013; 20: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Such a scenario implied that CNS2 acted in a deterministic manner to maintain Foxp3 expression in a CNS2-dependent Treg cell subset and that CNS2-deficient Treg cells that retained Foxp3 expression after homeostatic expansion were independent of CNS2 for Foxp3 maintenance. Alternatively, it was possible that CNS2 was required for the maintenance of Foxp3 expression in the entire population of dividing Treg cells, but Foxp3 was lost in a stochastic manner. To explore these alternatives, we isolated CNS2-sufficient and -deficient YFP+GFP+ Treg cells 7 weeks after the first transfer and transferred them again into T cell-deficient recipients. Five weeks after secondary transfer, we observed an essentially identical pattern to that of the primary transfer, i.e., ∼60% loss of Foxp3 expression in the absence of CNS2 (Figures 1F and 1G). These results suggested that the loss of Foxp3 expression in mature CNS2-deficient Treg cells was an apparently stochastic event associated with their division. We reasoned that the observed loss of Foxp3 by some Treg cells was either due to the deprivation of a factor(s) that is required for the maintenance of Foxp3 expression and is present in limiting amounts or due to the exposure to a limiting factor(s) that represses Foxp3 expression. IL-2 and STAT5 signaling plays an important role in the regulation of Foxp3 expression (Fontenot et al., 2005Fontenot J.D. Rasmussen J.P. Gavin M.A. Rudensky A.Y. A function for interleukin 2 in Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, Sakaguchi et al., 1995Sakaguchi S. Sakaguchi N.

Breakdown of a single mechanism of self-tolerance causes various autoimmune diseases.J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1151-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our recent cell fate mapping studies showed that IL-2 deprivation caused by administration of IL-2-neutralizing antibody results in a loss of Foxp3 expression by only a minor subset (∼15%) of YFP-tagged Treg cells (Rubtsov et al., 2010Rubtsov Y.P. Niec R.E. Josefowicz S. Li L. Darce J. Mathis D. Benoist C. Rudensky A.Y. Stability of the regulatory T cell lineage in vivo.Science. 2010; 329: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), though this may be an underestimate because IL-2/STAT5 signaling facilitates Treg cell viability. Thus, IL-2 could be a factor that “positively” acts via CNS2 and whose deprivation leads to a pronounced loss of Foxp3 expression in the absence of CNS2. Indeed, CNS2 contains multiple STAT5-binding motifs and can be bound by STAT5 (Figure S1A) (Ogawa et al., 2013Ogawa C. Tone Y. Tsuda M. Peter C. Waldmann H. Tone M.

Moriggl R. et al.Nonredundant roles for Stat5a/b in directly regulating Foxp3.Blood. 2007; 109: 4368-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that Treg cells expressing low amounts of CD25, a subunit of high-affinity IL-2 receptor, are unstable, whereas CD25high Treg cells faithfully maintain Foxp3 expression. Thus, we sought to examine whether CNS2 is required for the maintenance of Foxp3 expression only in CD25low or in both CD25low and CD25high Treg cells in vivo that are less or more efficient in IL-2 capture and signaling, respectively, as assessed by STAT5 phosphorylation (Figure S2A). Upon transfer into lymphopenic host, both CD25high and CD25low CNS2-deficient Treg cells showed markedly reduced ability to maintain Foxp3 expression upon cell division, compared to their wild-type counterparts, with CD25low CNS2-deficient Treg cells exhibiting the most pronounced Foxp3 loss (Figures 2A and S2B). These results raised the possibility that increased IL-2 signaling may rescue, at least in part, the loss of Foxp3 expression.Figure 2CNS2 Sustains Heritable Foxp3 Expression in Mature Treg Cells in the Presence of Limiting Amounts of IL-2Show full caption(A) The stability of Foxp3 expression is more sensitive to low levels of CD25 expression in CNS2-deficient Treg cells.

Multiple mechanisms can induce such persisters with high antimicrobial tolerance in vitro, but their in vivo relevance remains unclear. Using a fluorescent growth rate reporter, we detected extensive phenotypic variation of Salmonella in host tissues. This included slow-growing subsets as well as well-nourished fast-growing subsets driving disease progression. Monitoring of Salmonella growth and survival during chemotherapy revealed that antibiotic killing correlated with single-cell division rates. Nondividing Salmonella survived best but were rare, limiting their impact. Instead, most survivors originated from abundant moderately growing, partially tolerant Salmonella. These data demonstrate that host tissues diversify pathogen physiology, with major consequences for disease progression and control."

The in vitro manufacture of clinically relevant cells offers a potential strategy for regenerative therapy and permits disease modeling, toxicology testing, and drug discovery. Current approaches aim to engineer cell identity by means of directed differentiation from a pluripotent state or by transcription factor-driven conversion between differentiated states (Morris and Daley, 2013Morris S.A.

Wernig M. Direct lineage conversions: unnatural but useful?.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 892-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Directed differentiation typically comprises multiple steps, is time-consuming and inefficient, and commonly yields immature cells corresponding to embryonic counterparts rather than mature adult cells (Cohen and Melton, 2011Cohen D.E. Melton D. Turning straw into gold: directing cell fate for regenerative medicine.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). By comparison, direct conversion is relatively straightforward and rapid, but there is evidence for incomplete conversion, especially between divergent cell types (Morris and Daley, 2013Morris S.A.

Many examples of direct conversion between differentiated states have been reported in mouse and human, for example, from fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neurons (Huang et al., 2011Huang P.

More recently, several groups have described direct conversion to progenitor states, including hematopoietic, neuronal, and hepatic progenitors (Lujan et al., 2012Lujan E. Chanda S. Ahlenius H.

These engineering strategies predominantly employ transcription factor overexpression as a means to drive fate conversion. Current conversion strategies are often unable to fully specify a defined cell fate. For example, hepatic gene expression is not fully extinguished in neural cells derived from hepatocytes, and macrophages derived from fibroblasts harbor the originating cell signature and are prone to dedifferentiation (Feng et al., 2008Feng R. Desbordes S.C. Xie H. Tillo E.S. Pixley F. Stanley E.R. Graf T. PU.1 and C/EBPalpha/beta convert fibroblasts into macrophage-like cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Direct lineage conversion of terminally differentiated hepatocytes to functional neurons.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 9: 374-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, conversion of fibroblasts to cardiomyocytes yields cells that do not fully recapitulate the profile of neonatal cardiomyocytes (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.-D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by defined factors.Cell. 2010; 142: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). These observations are concerning since the extent to which an in vitro engineered cell population resembles its in vivo correlate transcriptionally and functionally is seldom assessed in a comprehensive or standardized manner. Measuring functional engraftment via transplantation into animal models lacks rigorous quantitation and the transcriptional similarity of engineered cell populations is commonly assessed by expression profiling followed by simple hierarchical clustering analysis. Such global analyses do not provide a quantitative means for assessing deficiencies of engineered cells, nor do they provide a systematic approach to prioritize interventions to improve fate specification. To address this, we developed a computational platform, CellNet, which reconstructs gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using publically available gene expression data for a range of cell types and tissues, and then classifies engineered cells according to establishment of GRNs for particular target cells, providing a precise metric of cell similarity. CellNet also identifies regulatory nodes at which engineered cells are distinct from target cells, and provides a ranked list of transcription factors whose manipulation is predicted to bring the engineered cell closer to the target. In an accompanying study, we have analyzed expression data for over 200 derived cell populations from 56 published reports and found that cells generated through directed differentiation more closely resemble their in vivo correlates compared to cells engineered via direct conversion, mainly due to failure of the converted cells to extinguish the expression programs of the starting cell type. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the establishment of GRNs associated with alternate fate was common to nearly all engineering strategies (Cahan et al., 2014Cahan P. Li H. Morris S.A. Lummertz da Rocha E. Daley G.Q. Collins J.J. CellNet: Network Biology Applied to Stem Cell Engineering.Cell. 2014; 158 (this issue): 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Here, we apply CellNet to two distinct cell fate engineering paradigms: conversion of B cells to macrophages, and fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells (iHeps). CellNet revealed that neither strategy generated fully converted cells; B cell identity was not extinguished in induced macrophages, whereas a progenitor state was transiently and partially established. Engineering the conversion to macrophages by knocking down CellNet-prioritized candidates improved target cell fate and function. iHeps, unlike primary hepatocytes, demonstrate impaired hepatocyte function, are immortalized, and exhibit progenitor marker expression that is extinguished following transplantation (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011Sekiya S. Suzuki A. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, CellNet revealed that iHeps manifest minimal liver identity. Surprisingly, CellNet unveiled considerable hindgut identity harbored by iHeps, regulated by Cdx2. We were able to demonstrate their long-term functional colon engraftment, indicating that iHeps in fact represent an endoderm progenitor rather than a differentiated cell type as previously thought. CellNet is thus a potent tool for reassessing and refining established conversion protocols. GRNs govern the steady-state expression program of a particular cell type and thus act as major molecular determinants of cell identity (Davidson and Erwin, 2006Davidson E.H. Erwin D.H. Gene regulatory networks and the evolution of animal body plans.Science. 2006; 311: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Measuring the establishment of cell and tissue-specific GRNs in engineered populations serves as both a robust metric of cellular identity and as a tool to detect the establishment of alternate GRNs. We designed CellNet to classify engineered cell populations by their similarity to target cells and tissues, to assess the extent to which target GRNs are established, and to score transcriptional regulators according to their likelihood of improving the engineered population (Figure 1A). The CellNet platform is fully detailed in our accompanying paper and is publically available (Cahan et al., 2014Cahan P. Li H. Morris S.A. Lummertz da Rocha E. Daley G.Q. Collins J.J. CellNet: Network Biology Applied to Stem Cell Engineering.Cell. 2014; 158 (this issue): 903-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, http://cellnet.hms.harvard.edu). B cell to macrophage conversion is a major paradigm for understanding principles of direct cell fate conversion (Bussmann et al., 2009Bussmann L.H. Schubert A. Vu Manh T.P. De Andres L. Desbordes S.C. Parra M. Zimmermann T. Rapino F. Rodriguez-Ubreva J. Ballestar E. Graf T. A robust and highly efficient immune cell reprogramming system.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Application of CellNet revealed that enforced expression of the transcription factor C/EBPα converts freshly harvested B cells into macrophages, following a time-dependent extinction of B cell identity and acquisition of a strong, exclusive macrophage classification score (Di Tullio et al., 2011Di Tullio A. Vu Manh T.P. Schubert A. Castellano G. Månsson R. Graf T. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP(alpha))-induced transdifferentiation of pre-B cells into macrophages involves no overt retrodifferentiation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 17016-17021Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; mean scores, B cell: 0.012, macrophage: 0.73; Figure 1B). In contrast to this, conversion of a cultured pre-B cell line engineered with estradiol-inducible C/EBPα (C10 cells, Bussmann et al., 2009Bussmann L.H. Schubert A. Vu Manh T.P. De Andres L. Desbordes S.C. Parra M. Zimmermann T. Rapino F. Rodriguez-Ubreva J. Ballestar E. Graf T. A robust and highly efficient immune cell reprogramming system.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 554-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar; Figure 1C) fails to fully extinguish B cell identity, yielding cells that only partially classify as macrophages 48 hr postconversion (mean scores: B cell: 0.65, macrophage: 0.54; Figure 1D). Interestingly, no significant changes in DNA methylation have been observed during this conversion, which may indicate that the C10 cell line harbors conversion barriers unique to in vitro cultured cell lines (Rodríguez-Ubreva et al., 2012Rodríguez-Ubreva J. Ciudad L. Gómez-Cabrero D. Parra M. Bussmann L.H. di Tullio A. Kallin E.M. Tegnér J. Graf T. Ballestar E. Pre-B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation without significant promoter DNA methylation changes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 1954-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite this limitation, the inducible C10 cell line represents a robust system to interrogate the molecular mechanisms of direct conversion and a valuable model for applying CellNet to enhance cell fate conversion. To enable identification of GRNs that fail to extinguish or are incompletely or aberrantly established in engineered cells, we devised a metric of GRN status. We assessed the expression of each gene in a GRN relative to its expected value and then weighted each gene by its importance to the network and to the associated cell and tissue classifier (Figure 2A). To prioritize transcriptional regulator interventions that might improve engineering strategies, we computed a network influence score that integrates the expression level of the regulator in the target cell or tissue, the extent of dysregulation of the regulator and its predicted targets in the query sample, and the number of predicted targets (Figure 2B). We applied these functions of CellNet to the estradiol-inducible C10 B cell to macrophage conversion. Assessment of GRN status revealed that the macrophage GRN was gradually but not completely established over 48 hr, whereas the B cell GRN remained intact (Figure 2C). These data were in contrast to the almost complete conversion of native B cells (Figures 1B and S1A available online). Interestingly, CellNet also exposed the partial and transient establishment of a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) GRN during conversion of C10 cells (Figure 2C), and similarly in the conversion of native B cells (Figure 1B; Di Tullio et al., 2011Di Tullio A.

USA. 2011; 108: 17016-17021Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), raising the provocative possibility that expression of C/EBPα induces a transient wave of progenitor GRN reactivation from which macrophages ultimately emerge.Figure S1Direct Conversion of B Cells to Macrophages, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A) B cell and macrophage GRN status in conversion of primary pre-B cells to macrophages (Di Tullio et al., 2011Di Tullio A.

In an attempt to improve conversion of C10-induced macrophages, we extended the duration of C/EBPα expression to 4 days, but neither B cell nor macrophage statuses improved, suggesting that the partial conversion was not due to insufficient duration of C/EBPα expression (Figure S1B). B cell GRN persistence was striking in the converted cells, thus we consulted CellNet to score transcriptional regulators of B cell identity. CellNet-prioritized Pou2af1 (Pou2 associating factor 1) and Ebf1 (Early B cell factor 1) as transcriptional regulators associated with B cell identity that remained expressed at inappropriately high levels in the converted cells (Figure 2D). Ebf1 promotes B cell fate and blocks alternate fates (Nechanitzky et al., 2013Nechanitzky R. Akbas D. Scherer S. Györy I. Hoyler T. Ramamoorthy S. Diefenbach A. Grosschedl R. Transcription factor EBF1 is essential for the maintenance of B cell identity and prevention of alternative fates in committed cells.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas Pou2af1 coactivates Oct1 and Oct2 on B-cell-specific promoters and is important for B cell activation and maturation (Lins et al., 2003Lins K. Reményi A. Tomilin A. Massa S. Wilmanns M. Matthias P. Schöler H.R. OBF1 enhances transcriptional potential of Oct1.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2188-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In our experiments, conversion of the C10 B cell line was highly reproducible, with the majority of cells gaining Mac1 positivity and losing CD19 expression within 48 hr (Figure S1C). To facilitate investigation of CellNet-enhanced conversion, we identified CD302 as a cell surface antigen that was inadequately expressed on induced relative to native macrophages (Figure S1D). We then knocked down Ebf1 or Pou2af1 using lentivirally delivered shRNAs, resulting in an ∼80% reduction in target gene expression (Figure S2A). Next, we initiated conversion with β-estradiol and after 72 hr analyzed expression of Mac1 and CD302 by flow cytometry. Knockdown of either Ebf1 or Pou2af1 significantly expanded the Mac1brightCD302+ population relative to scramble shRNA-treated cells (Figure 2E). We then tested the macrophage-associated functions of Ebf1 and Pou2af1-depleted cells. Cell migration, formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, and phagocytosis were all significantly enhanced relative to untreated and scramble-treated cells (Figures 2F, S2B, and S2C). Quantitative PCR analysis showed a decrease in expression of some B cell-specific genes whereas others were paradoxically upregulated; however, there was a more consistent increase in macrophage-specific gene expression (Figure S2D). We reapplied CellNet to the engineered cells and found that knockdown of Ebf1 or Pou2af1 fortified their macrophage classification, corroborating their improved in vitro function (Figure 2G; mean scores: Scramble: 0.39, Ebf1 knockdown: 0.52, Pou2af1 knockdown: 0.54). However, although macrophage GRN status significantly improved (Figure 2H: Ebf1 knockdown: p = 0.029, Pou2af1 knockdown: p = 0.011), detailed analysis revealed that the B cell GRN was not extinguished following knockdown of these factors, perhaps due to the existence of feedback loops reinforcing B cell identity. To explore this, we searched CellNet GRNs for regulatory loops in which Pou2af1 loss is predicted to increase B cell factor expression. Indeed, we found several such loops, including one connecting Pou2af1 downregulation to the upregulation of the master B cell regulator Pax5, and Ebf1 itself through Runx2 and Runx3 (Figures S2D and S2E). These data suggest that residual expression of Ebf1 and Pou2af1 in the converted cells serves primarily to repress macrophage fate. We explored the possibility that Ebf1 and Pou2af1 mutually repress myeloid-associated GRNs, as previously reported for Ebf1 (Nechanitzky et al., 2013Nechanitzky R. Akbas D. Scherer S. Györy I. Hoyler T. Ramamoorthy S. Diefenbach A. Grosschedl R. Transcription factor EBF1 is essential for the maintenance of B cell identity and prevention of alternative fates in committed cells.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Examining targets directly linked to Ebf1/Pou2af1 in the overall GRN, as well as targets of transcription factors that Ebf1/Pou2af1 target themselves, we found that the set of macrophage genes upregulated by B cell factor knockdown were significantly enriched in genes that CellNet predicted to be repressed by Pou2af1 or Ebf1 (p ≤ 0.005 and 0.05, respectively, Tables S1 and S2; Figure S2F). Thus, the improved in vitro function of Ebf1/Pou2af1-depleted cells following C/EBPα-induced conversion of C10 cells is at least in part due to the repressive actions of these B cell regulators on macrophage gene expression programs. B cell to macrophage conversion demonstrates the utility of CellNet to dissect cell identity and prioritize candidates to improve fate specification iteratively. Conversion of B cells to macrophages represents a conversion between closely related cells. To investigate a dramatic change in fate between more disparate germ layers, we focused on conversion of mesoderm-derived fibroblasts to endoderm-derived hepatocytes. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) to hepatocyte-like cell conversion has been reported by two independent groups: Sekiya and Suzuki employed Hnf4α, with either Foxa1, 2, or 3, while Huang and colleagues utilized Gata4, Hnf1α, and Foxa3 in concert with inactivation of p19(Arf) (Huang et al., 2011Huang P.

Suzuki A. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In both reports, the resulting induced hepatocytes were capable of engrafting fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (Fah–/–) mice, a tyrosinemia model of liver failure. However, unlike primary hepatocytes, iHeps demonstrated impaired hepatocyte function and were unable to fully repopulate Fah–/– mice. Liver function remained abnormal, resulting in reduced survival rates. Curiously, iHeps were immortalized and expressed progenitor markers such as Alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), whose expression ceased following transplantation (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011Sekiya S. Suzuki A. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). We reproduced the Sekiya and Suzuki MEF to iHep conversion (Figure 3A). Careful analysis of the derived cells showed that we attained comparable derivation efficiency and that the cells expressed E-cadherin and albumin, stored glycogen, took up low-density lipoprotein (LDL), secreted albumin, and produced urea (Figures S3A–S3F). As previously reported, we observed emergence of epithelial-like iHep colonies 3 weeks following transduction and culture on collagen-coated plates. Moreover, these cells were immortalized, in accordance with the previous report, and we have been able to continuously passage established iHep lines for over a year. These analyses confirm that our iHeps appear equivalent to those previously reported (Sekiya and Suzuki, 2011Sekiya S. Suzuki A. Direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Ex vivo cultured primary hepatocytes are known to dedifferentiate (Strain, 1994Strain A.J. Isolated hepatocytes: use in experimental and clinical hepatology.Gut. 1994; 35: 433-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). qPCR analysis of key liver markers in iHeps showed very weak hepatic gene expression relative to both freshly isolated primary and dedifferentiated hepatocytes, and much higher levels of Afp and E-cadherin (Figure S3G). The failure of iHeps to reach expression levels of even dedifferentiated primary hepatocytes suggests that their inadequacy is not due to culture conditions alone.Figure S3Characterization of iHeps Derived from Fibroblasts, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Efficiency of conversion to iHeps: Alkaline phosphatase staining of E-cadherin expressing colonies.(B) Immunofluorescence staining of E-cadherin and Albumin in iHeps and MEFs.(C) Visualization of glycogen storage via Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining in iHeps.(D) Low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake in iHeps and MEFs.

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the first TRN ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting TRN neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensory-projecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-specific optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the TRN separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function.

https://openalex.org/W2054281806,"The homeostasis of multicellular organisms requires terminally differentiated cells to preserve their lineage specificity. However, it is unclear whether mechanisms exist to actively protect cell identity in response to environmental cues that confer functional plasticity. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, specified by the transcription factor Foxp3, are indispensable for immune system homeostasis. Here, we report that conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS2), a CpG-rich Foxp3 intronic cis-element specifically demethylated in mature Tregs, helps maintain immune homeostasis and limit autoimmune disease development by protecting Treg identity in response to signals that shape mature Treg functions and drive their initial differentiation. In activated Tregs, CNS2 helps protect Foxp3 expression from destabilizing cytokine conditions by sensing TCR/NFAT activation, which facilitates the interaction between CNS2 and Foxp3 promoter. Thus, epigenetically marked cis-elements can protect cell identity by sensing key environmental cues central to both cell identity formation and functional plasticity without interfering with initial cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2015285144,"Sewer systems are among the most critical infrastructure assets for modern urban societies and provide essential human health protection. Sulfide-induced concrete sewer corrosion costs billions of dollars annually and has been identified as a main cause of global sewer deterioration. We performed a 2-year sampling campaign in South East Queensland (Australia), an extensive industry survey across Australia, and a comprehensive model-based scenario analysis of the various sources of sulfide. Aluminum sulfate addition during drinking water production contributes substantially to the sulfate load in sewage and indirectly serves as the primary source of sulfide. This unintended consequence of urban water management structures could be avoided by switching to sulfate-free coagulants, with no or only marginal additional expenses compared with the large potential savings in sewer corrosion costs."

Using genetic and optogenetic methods, we identified two types of bipolar interneurons that convey visual input from photoreceptors to a circuit that computes the direction in which objects are moving. We then sought recognition molecules that promote selective connections of these cells with previously characterized components of the circuit. We found that the type II cadherins, cdh8 and cdh9, are each expressed selectively by one of the two bipolar cell types. Using loss- and gain-of-function methods, we showed that they are critical determinants of connectivity in this circuit and that perturbation of their expression leads to distinct defects in visually evoked responses. Our results reveal cellular components of a retinal circuit and demonstrate roles of type II cadherins in synaptic choice and circuit function."

Stem cells exit proliferation at defined times during development. When organogenesis is completed, they enter senescence, differentiate, or die (Iglesias-Bartolome and Gutkind, 2011Iglesias-Bartolome R. Gutkind J.S.

Persistence of embryonic stem cell populations into adulthood results in tumorigenesis (Blum and Benvenisty, 2008Blum B. Benvenisty N. The tumorigenicity of human embryonic stem cells.Adv.

Understanding how the timely disappearance of stem cell populations is coordinated with developmental timing is therefore important for both stem cell and tumor biology. Drosophila neural stem cells are called neuroblasts (NBs) and provide a tractable system to study stem cell proliferation and terminal differentiation (Kohlmaier and Edgar, 2008Kohlmaier A.

NBs divide asymmetrically into a larger cell that maintains stem cell identity and a smaller cell committed to differentiation. This is achieved through the differential segregation of the kinase aPKC into the larger daughter cell and the cell fate determinants Numb, Prospero, and Brat into the smaller daughter cell (Hirata et al., 1995Hirata J.

During larval stages, NBs divide hundreds of times to self-renew and generate differentiated neurons or glia. After every division, each NB re-grows to its original size and therefore maintains a constant volume throughout larval development (Ito and Hotta, 1992Ito K. Hotta Y.

During the pupal stages, NBs continue dividing for a limited time but disappear before adult stages (White and Kankel, 1978White K. Kankel D.R.

As distinct NB subpopulations disappear at different times (Truman and Bate, 1988Truman J.W. Bate M. Spatial and temporal patterns of neurogenesis in the central nervous system of Drosophila melanogaster.Dev. Biol. 1988; 125: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), cell-cycle exit is not simply a response to a systemic program. Distinct mechanisms have been postulated for the timely disappearance of various subgroups of NBs. In the abdominal ventral nerve cord (VNC), NBs die by apoptosis (Bello et al., 2003Bello B.C. Hirth F. Gould A.P. A pulse of the Drosophila Hox protein Abdominal-A schedules the end of neural proliferation via neuroblast apoptosis.Neuron. 2003; 37: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) whereas a combination of apoptosis and autophagy eliminates the mushroom body NBs, a particularly long-lived subpopulation of NBs in the central brain (CB) (Siegrist et al., 2010Siegrist S.E. Haque N.S. Chen C.H. Hay B.A. Hariharan I.K. Inactivation of both Foxo and reaper promotes long-term adult neurogenesis in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 643-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the majority of CB NBs, however, a terminal symmetric division preceded by a reduction in cell size terminates the proliferative state at a specific time during pupal development (Maurange et al., 2008Maurange C. Cheng L. Gould A.P. Temporal transcription factors and their targets schedule the end of neural proliferation in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that trigger terminal symmetric division or apoptosis at a specific time are currently not understood. Like Drosophila embryonic NBs, larval NBs in the thoracic region of the VNC progress through distinct temporal stages expressing specific transcription factors in a temporally defined manner (Maurange et al., 2008Maurange C. Cheng L. Gould A.P. Temporal transcription factors and their targets schedule the end of neural proliferation in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, Chai et al., 2013Chai P.C. Liu Z. Chia W. Cai Y. Hedgehog signaling acts with the temporal cascade to promote neuroblast cell cycle exit.PLoS Biol. 2013; 11: e1001494Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). How these temporal factors ultimately lead to stem cell exit is unclear. Here, we show that a change in NB metabolism induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone and the Mediator complex at the larval to pupal transition leads to a reduction in cell growth and to uncoupling between cell size and cell-cycle progression that is responsible for terminal differentiation. Our study shows that the connection between cellular growth and cell-cycle progression can be under developmental control and reveals a connection between transcription regulation of metabolism and stem cell terminal differentiation. It further suggests a mechanism by which metabolism regulates cancer cell proliferation. CB NBs constitute the larger population of NBs in the Drosophila brain and are classified into ∼86 type I, four mushroom body (MB), and eight type II NBs. Type I and MB NBs divide to generate one NB and one ganglion mother cell (GMC) that divides once more to produce two neurons or glia cells. Type II NBs give rise to one NB and one intermediate neural progenitor (INP) that can self-renew a limited number of times generating one INP and one GMC. Both type I and type II NBs express the cortical marker Miranda (Mira) while only type I NBs also express the nuclear transcription factor Asense (Ase) (Bello et al., 2008Bello B.C. Izergina N. Caussinus E. Reichert H. Amplification of neural stem cell proliferation by intermediate progenitor cells in Drosophila brain development.Neural Dev. 2008; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, Bowman et al., 2008Bowman S.K.

Cell. 2008; 14: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Stem cell proliferation in the CB is ended by a symmetric terminal division of a smaller sized NB (Maurange et al., 2008Maurange C. Cheng L. Gould A.P. Temporal transcription factors and their targets schedule the end of neural proliferation in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To identify the events leading to this terminal division, we quantified cell size and growth rates at various times. Both type I and type II pupal NBs became smaller during pupal development (Figures 1A–1C and Figure S1F available online). Plotting cell diameter versus the time after pupa formation (APF) revealed that the different types of NBs reduced their size at different rates. Type II NBs and posterior type I NBs started larger, but lost volume more rapidly, reaching the size of their daughter INPs or GMCs, respectively, at 16 hr APF (Figures 1C and S1F), at which point NBs disappeared (Figures S1C–S1E). Anterior type I NBs, in contrast, started off smaller but shrank more slowly. They divided for a longer period and disappeared around 24 hr APF when they were as small as their daughter GMCs (Figures 1C, S1A, S1B, S1E, and S1F). Volumetric calculations revealed that the rate of cell size reduction for each NB type corresponds to the volume lost to generate differentiated daughter cells (Figures S1G–S1I), indicating that a reduction in cell growth could lead to proliferation exit of CB Drosophila NBs.Figure S1Pupal NBs Do Not Regrow Completely after Each Division, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A–D) Fixed WT brains of indicated stage.

Yee L.L. Gould A.P. Fat cells reactivate quiescent neuroblasts via TOR and glial insulin relays in Drosophila.Nature. 2011; 471: 508-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and altered nutrient supply could explain cell size reduction. To test the cell autonomy of NB shrinking and to quantify growth and cell-cycle length, we used a long-term culture system (Homem et al., 2013Homem C.C. Reichardt I. Berger C. Lendl T. Knoblich J.A. Long-term live cell imaging and automated 4D analysis of DrosophilaDrosophila neuroblast lineages.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e79588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Like in vivo, both type I and type II larval and pupal NBs could divide multiple times in culture (Figures 1D and 1E; Movies S1 and S2; data not shown). While larval NBs re-grew to their original size after each division (Figures 1D and 1H), pupal NBs cultured under the same conditions did not re-grow and therefore became progressively smaller (Figures 1E and 1H) until they underwent an equal size symmetric cell division (Figure 1E, arrow heads in 22:24). Quantification of cell cycle and growth indicates that pupal NB size reduction is not due to an accelerated cell cycle; in fact during this stage NB cell cycle was slower (Figure 1G). Thus, a cell-autonomous modification of cell growth characteristics precedes proliferation exit in Drosophila NBs. Defects in asymmetric cell division trigger brain tumor formation in flies. Tumorous NBs no longer exit the cell cycle and can persist into adulthood (Loop et al., 2004Loop T. Leemans R. Stiefel U. Hermida L. Egger B. Xie F. Primig M. Certa U. Fischbach K.F. Reichert H. Hirth F. Transcriptional signature of an adult brain tumor in Drosophila.BMC Genomics. 2004; 5: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test whether this is accompanied by a loss of cell size control, we cultured pupal NBs from flies expressing a transgenic brat RNAi construct (bratIR). bratIR pupal NBs were still able to divide multiple times, but unlike wild-type (WT) pupal NBs, remained big and were indistinguishable from larval NBs (Figures 1F and 1H; Movie S3). As the cell cycle duration of bratIR pupal NBs was not significantly different from pupal NBs (Figure 1G), we concluded that tumor NBs lose the ability to reduce growth in response to a developmental program. Taken together, these results suggest that a specific cellular program triggered during pupal stages causes Drosophila NBs to exit proliferation by inhibiting cellular growth in a cell-autonomous fashion. As the insulin/target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway (Greer and Brunet, 2005Greer E.L. Brunet A. FOXO transcription factors at the interface between longevity and tumor suppression.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar) has been shown to regulate lifespan in MB NBs (Siegrist et al., 2010Siegrist S.E.

Activation of insulin signaling by overexpressing the insulin-like peptides (ILPs) ILP2 and ILP5 or a constitutively active insulin receptor InR (InRCA), or by RNAi of its effector FOXO did not prevent NB cell-cycle exit (Figures 2A–2E and S2A). Conversely, inhibition of insulin signaling using dominant negative InR (InRDN), or FOXO overexpression also did not influence NB disappearance (Figures 2F, 2G, and S2A).Figure S2Known Growth and Death Regulators Are Not Essential for Type I Pupa NB Shrinkage, Related to Figure 2Show full captionDiameter averages of all remaining type I NBs in brains 24hr APF.

PI3K is a convergence point of multiple growth signaling pathways (Cheng et al., 2011Cheng L.Y. Bailey A.P. Leevers S.J. Ragan T.J. Driscoll P.C. Gould A.P. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase spares organ growth during nutrient restriction in Drosophila.Cell. 2011; 146: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We therefore overexpressed PI3K (Figure 2H), its downstream effector AKT (Figures 2I and S2A) as well as the PI3K downstream effectors and TOR activators Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) and S6K in pupal NBs (Figures 2J, 2K, and S2A). Although activation of PI3K or AKT/TOR did not cause any observable phenotypes in larval stages, neither was sufficient to prevent pupal NB shrinkage and disappearance (Figures 2O, 2P, and S2A). Together, these data show that the insulin/TOR and PI3K pathways are not sufficient to promote NB growth or prevent NB cell-cycle exit and disappearance. Under starvation conditions, autophagy can be activated (Chang et al., 2009Chang Y.Y. Juhász G. Goraksha-Hicks P. Arsham A.M. Mallin D.R. Muller L.K. Neufeld T.P. Nutrient-dependent regulation of autophagy through the target of rapamycin pathway.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Inhibition of this pathway with a dominant negative form of autophagy-specific gene 1 (UAS-ATG1K38Q) (Siegrist et al., 2010Siegrist S.E. Haque N.S. Chen C.H. Hay B.A. Hariharan I.K. Inactivation of both Foxo and reaper promotes long-term adult neurogenesis in Drosophila.Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 643-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) caused no effect in CB NB size or number in late pupal stages (Figures 2L, 2O, 2P, and S2A). Similarly, inhibition of apoptosis by overexpressing antiapoptotic p35 (Hay et al., 1994Hay B.A. Wolff T. Rubin G.M. Expression of baculovirus P35 prevents cell death in Drosophila.Development. 1994; 120: 2121-2129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was not capable of preventing pupal NB disappearance (Figures 2M, 2O, 2P, and S2A). Finally, decreasing reactive oxygen species by overexpressing superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) did not change pupal NB number or size (Figures 2N–2P and S2A). These results indicate that there must be yet unknown mechanisms that regulate pupal NB growth and are responsible for their disappearance. As none of the known regulatory pathways explain NB shrinkage, we carried out a genome-wide in vivo RNAi screen for extended or reduced NB life span (Figure 3A). To streamline the protocol, we expressed a transgene encoding firefly luciferase together with RNAi lines from the Vienna Drosophila Research Center KK collection in CB type II NBs and their progeny. Although these transgenes are no longer expressed in adults, pilot experiments revealed considerable perdurance of luciferase activity into adulthood (data not shown). We used CB type II NBs because they are not essential for fly viability, allowing us to also probe the effect of genes essential for cell survival on luciferase expression. For each RNAi line, six heads from 1-day-old adults were homogenized in 96-well plates. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicates (Figure 3B) and signals were normalized to the average of the WT control. In total, we screened 9,700 RNAi lines each corresponding to a different gene (70% of the Drosophila protein coding genome). The vast majority of these caused either no change or a reduction in luciferase activity (Figure 3C). This is expected as NB cell death or mitotic arrest caused by RNAi of cell essential genes should decrease luciferase activity. To identify genes inducing timely disappearance of NBs, we focused on a subset of 388 genes where at least one of the luciferase reads was more than 4-fold higher than the control and the variation coefficient for the three samples was below 0.4 (Table S1). Gene Ontology (GO) term analysis of these 388 genes revealed that the category of stem cell differentiation was overrepresented (Figure 3D, nodes with blue border, p = 0.002). This includes known tumor suppressor genes and NB temporal transcription factors. Their knock down results in adult NB proliferation (Bello et al., 2006Bello B. Reichert H. Hirth F. The brain tumor gene negatively regulates neural progenitor cell proliferation in the larval central brain of Drosophila.Development. 2006; 133: 2639-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, Maurange et al., 2008Maurange C.

Temporal transcription factors and their targets schedule the end of neural proliferation in Drosophila.Cell. 2008; 133: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) nicely confirming our screening strategy. Analysis of protein-protein and genetic interactions between the identified genes revealed three distinct interaction clusters (Figure 3D). One cluster contained genes with no GO term enriched and was not pursued further (Figure 3D, gray outline, s = 2.5). A second cluster included five members of the Mediator complex (Figure 3D, red outline, s = 1.8), while the third cluster contained three genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) (Figure 3D, green outline, s = 1). We focused on these genes for further analysis as they had not previously been connected to proliferation control in NBs. Mediator is a highly conserved protein complex of 26–30 subunits that connects transcription factors to RNA Polymerase II (Malik and Roeder, 2010Malik S. Roeder R.G.

Mediator maintains the pluripotent state of embryonic stem cells by binding so-called super enhancers and activating the transcriptional network for maintaining the ES cell state (Kagey et al., 2010Kagey M.H.

As we identified multiple Mediator subunits in our screen (Figure 3D), we analyzed the RNAi phenotype of the complex subunits in pupal NBs. To test if these genes are involved in NB disappearance, we performed this phenotypic analysis of NBs at 24 hr APF, a time point when most type I and all type II NBs have already disappeared in the WT. Transgenic RNAi constructs targeting eight Mediator subunits (Med4, Med6, Med9, Med10, Med11, Med22, Med27, Med31) prolonged lifetime and prevented shrinkage of both type I (Figures S3E–S3I and data not shown) and type II NBs (representative examples in Figures 4A–4D , quantified in Figures 4E and 4F). RNAi of all these Mediator subunits did not have any obvious effect on larval NBs (Figures S3A–S3D, S3L, and S3M). These RNAi phenotypes are specific as they could be confirmed by a secondary RNAi line (Figure S3I). In addition, NB lifespan could also be prolonged by expressing Med12 (Kohtalo, Kto), an inhibitory subunit that has been shown to repress Mediator function (Malik and Roeder, 2010Malik S. Roeder R.G. The metazoan Mediator co-activator complex as an integrative hub for transcriptional regulation.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4K). To determine if these longer lived NBs continue proliferating we stained them for phosphohistone H3 ("

Protein function prediction: towards integration of similarity metrics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and therefore require novel methods of identification (Radivojac et al., 2013Radivojac P. Clark W.T. Oron T.R. Schnoes A.M. Wittkop T. Sokolov A. Graim K. Funk C. Verspoor K. Ben-Hur A. et al.A large-scale evaluation of computational protein function prediction.Nat. Methods. 2013; 10: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Increasingly, these methods rely on computational network analysis (Sharan et al., 2007Sharan R. Ulitsky I. Shamir R. Network-based prediction of protein function.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Such networks are composed of protein or gene nodes connected by intrinsic links, which indicate common evolutionary origins across species, and contextual links, which indicate interactions or biological correlations among genes and proteins within a genome. The function of a protein node can then be inferred either through local network analysis that transfers annotations from the nodes it directly connects to or through global analysis that optimizes some relatedness measure over the entire network (Sharan et al., 2007Sharan R. Ulitsky I. Shamir R. Network-based prediction of protein function.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2007; 3: 88Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, Vazquez et al., 2003Vazquez A. Flammini A. Maritan A. Vespignani A. Global protein function prediction from protein-protein interaction networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Although local network analyses are computationally relatively inexpensive, they are also of limited value in sparsely annotated network regions (Erdin et al., 2011Erdin S. Lisewski A.M. Lichtarge O. Protein function prediction: towards integration of similarity metrics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) because they cannot reach for information beyond an immediate neighborhood (Chua et al., 2006Chua H.N. Sung W.K. Wong L. Exploiting indirect neighbours and topological weight to predict protein function from protein-protein interactions.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 1623-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, such areas of very sparsely annotated genome regions include genomes of disease-causing agents (Ideker and Sharan, 2008Ideker T. Sharan R. Protein networks in disease.Genome Res. 2008; 18: 644-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). For example, in the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, the low sensitivity of current annotation methods leaves most genes without any known biological function (Aurrecoechea et al., 2009Aurrecoechea C. Brestelli J. Brunk B.P. Dommer J. Fischer S. Gajria B. Gao X. Gingle A. Grant G. Harb O.S. et al.PlasmoDB: a functional genomic database for malaria parasites.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D539-D543Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, Gardner et al., 2002Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. et al.Genome sequence of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar). By contrast, global network approaches can be more sensitive, but their computational demands typically restrict them to smaller networks that can encompass single proteomes with only several thousand nodes (Erdin et al., 2011Erdin S. Lisewski A.M. Lichtarge O. Protein function prediction: towards integration of similarity metrics.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Vazquez et al., 2003Vazquez A. Flammini A. Maritan A. Vespignani A. Global protein function prediction from protein-protein interaction networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In this study, we apply a known global network-based function prediction method, termed graph-based information diffusion (GID; Venner et al., 2010Venner E. Lisewski A.M. Erdin S. Ward R.M. Amin S.R. Lichtarge O. Accurate protein structure annotation through competitive diffusion of enzymatic functions over a network of local evolutionary similarities.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e14286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), over so-called supergenomic networks that comprise all the genes from hundreds of genomes. To achieve this, we propose a general network compression scheme that dramatically reduces the number of network links by eliminating redundancies within and between network cliques. In the context of supergenomic networks, these cliques consist of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) (Tatusov et al., 1997Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. A genomic perspective on protein families.Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar). Critically, network compression does not significantly perturb global network analysis: GID is much more efficient on a compressed network but still accurately reproduces GID outputs on an uncompressed network. Thus network compression opens, in principle, the known gene and protein space to global network-based function prediction. As a validation of this approach, we tested a GID-based prediction in P. falciparum 3D7 parasites of the biological function of exported protein 1 (EXP1), also referred to as exported antigen 5.1 (Ag5.1) or circumsporozoite-related antigen/protein (CRA) (Hope et al., 1984Hope I.A. Hall R. Simmons D.L. Hyde J.E. Scaife J.G. Evidence for immunological cross-reaction between sporozoites and blood stages of a human malaria parasite.Nature. 1984; 308: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, Simmons et al., 1987Simmons D. Woollett G. Bergin-Cartwright M. Kay D. Scaife J. A malaria protein exported into a new compartment within the host erythrocyte.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). Even though the biological role of EXP1 has not been characterized, several lines of evidence suggest that this small 17 kDa polypeptide is important to malaria pathogenesis. Failure to disrupt this exp1 gene, which is well conserved among Plasmodium species (Simmons et al., 1987Simmons D. Woollett G. Bergin-Cartwright M. Kay D. Scaife J. A malaria protein exported into a new compartment within the host erythrocyte.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar), suggests its essentiality for the parasite (Maier et al., 2008Maier A.G.

Coppel R.L. et al.Exported proteins required for virulence and rigidity of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes.Cell. 2008; 134: 48-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). This gene is also one of the most abundantly transcribed loci (PF11_0224/PF3D7_1121600) during the ring and early trophozoite stages (Bozdech et al., 2003Bozdech Z. Llinás M. Pulliam B.L. Wong E.D.

The protein product is mainly exported to the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) and to cytosolic compartments in infected red blood cells (RBCs) (Simmons et al., 1987Simmons D. Woollett G. Bergin-Cartwright M. Kay D. Scaife J. A malaria protein exported into a new compartment within the host erythrocyte.EMBO J. 1987; 6: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar), where it forms homomers in the membrane (Spielmann et al., 2006Spielmann T.

Microbiol. 2006; 59: 779-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). EXP1 triggers an antigenic immune response in humans (Simossis et al., 2005Simossis V.A. Kleinjung J. Heringa J. Homology-extended sequence alignment.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and has been explored as a malaria vaccine candidate (Caspers et al., 1991Caspers P. Etlinger H. Matile H. Pink J.R. Stüber D. Takács B. A Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine candidate which contains epitopes from the circumsporozoite protein and a blood stage antigen, 5.1.Mol.

Natural antibody response to Plasmodium falciparum Exp-1, MSP-3 and GLURP long synthetic peptides and association with protection.Parasite Immunol. 2004; 26: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We demonstrate, as predicted by GID, that EXP1 is a glutathione S-transferase (GST) that conjugates glutathione onto hematin—the main cytotoxin released during malarial blood stage infection. This activity is unique among known membrane GSTs but is nonetheless consistent with their ability to protect cells against xenobiotic and oxidative stress (Morgenstern et al., 2011Morgenstern R. Zhang J. Johansson K. Microsomal glutathione transferase 1: mechanism and functional roles.Drug Metab. Rev. 2011; 43: 300-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We further show that EXP1 is potently inhibited by the current antimalarial drug of choice, artesunate (ART). This soluble artemisinin derivative is currently recommended by the World Health Organization as the frontline treatment of severe falciparum malaria (World Health Organization (WHO), 2011World Health Organization (WHO)Section 8.4.1. In Guidelines for the Treatment of Malaria, 2nd edition – Rev. 1. World Health Organization, 2011Google Scholar) even though its future efficacy is uncertain due to emerging parasite resistance to artemisinins (Ariey et al., 2014Ariey F. Witkowski B. Amaratunga C. Beghain J. Langlois A.C. Khim N. Kim S. Duru V. Bouchier C. Ma L. et al.A molecular marker of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria.Nature. 2014; 505: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Our identification of EXP1 as a P. falciparum membrane-bound GST suggests previously unresolved modes of hematin metabolism and ART-mediated stress response in parasitized RBCs. Network compression exploits the COG cliques present in supergenomic networks (see Experimental Procedures) in two steps. First, intra-clique compression replaces each COG clique with a star graph (Figure 1A). All the edges among the members of a clique are removed, and instead every node becomes connected by a single edge to a new core node for the clique, weighted by the size of the clique, ncog (Figures 1A and 1B). In a realistic supergenomic network, however, still more compression is required. For example, over 373 proteomes from different species, the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) database (von Mering et al., 2007von Mering C. Jensen L.J. Kuhn M. Chaffron S. Doerks T. Krüger B. Snel B. Bork P. STRING 7—recent developments in the integration and prediction of protein interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D358-D362Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), yielded a supergenomic network with n ≈1.51 × 106 protein nodes connected by nc ≈3.86 × 107 contextual links and up to ni ≈1.93 × 1011 intrinsic links (Figure 1B and Experimental Procedures). The latter included 5.41 × 108 intra-COG links from 33,929 COGs. Intra-clique compression reduces these nearly 400-fold, to 1.38 × 106, at the cost of adding ∼2% (33,929) new core nodes to build the star graphs. The network structure, however, is still dominated by ∼1011 inter-COG links and remains beyond practical computational capabilities. To further reduce computational cost, the second essential step is inter-clique compression, which additionally compresses evolutionary relationships between COGs. All the links between a pair of COGs are replaced by a single edge connecting their core nodes, weighted by average sequence similarity between COGs (Figure 1C). The number of inter-COG links now falls almost 105-fold from 1.93 × 1011 to 6.81 × 106. After full compression, the total number of remaining intrinsic links is 8.19 × 106, which is of the same order of magnitude as that of contextual links. Critically, this compression perturbs GID only mildly: in extensive simulations on random networks with nodes assigned random initial conditions, the relative error between GID on the full network and on the compressed network remained below ∼10% when the original uncompressed graph had an edge density below ∼20% (Figures S1A and S1B; see specific example in Figures 1D and 1E), i.e., when the graph contained less than ∼20% of all possible edges (see Extended Experimental Procedures). Thus network compression perturbs GID minimally when the underlying network is sparse. These and additional numerical data (Figures S1C–S1E and Extended Experimental Procedures) suggest that network compression was essential to practically enable GID on large supergenomic networks with a loss of accuracy that is tolerable and adjustable. Network compression was computationally efficient because in supergenomic networks, the number of maximal cliques has a linear relation to the number of network nodes (Figure S1F). Given that the computational time to find all maximal cliques in a network is bounded linearly by the number of nodes per single maximal clique (Eppstein et al., 2010Eppstein D. Loffler M. Strash D. Listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs in near-optimal time.Proceedings of the 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2010). 2010; 6506: 403-413Google Scholar), the observation that the total maximal clique number rises linearly and not exponentially with network size ensures that a complete list of compressible cliques can be computed efficiently, i.e., in nonexponential, linear time (Figure S1G, black graph). In contrast, other common complex networks such as Erdős-Rényi random graphs have a number of maximal cliques that are exponential in the number of nodes (Figure S1G, red graph). Consequently, in larger networks, their detection quickly becomes computationally prohibitive. Supergenomic networks are therefore biological examples of networks where clique detection is computationally efficient. To explain the efficiency of compression in supergenomic networks, we modeled evolutionary relationships between genes by preferential attachment among cliques (Figure S1H): beginning with a small number of a few given cliques, a new clique was added to the network by linking it to an existing clique with a probability defined by the connectivity of that clique. This scale-free network generation model (Wang et al., 2009Wang B. Yang X.-h. Wang W.-l. A novel scale-free network model based on clique growth.J Cent South Univ Technol. 2009; 16: 474-477Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) is a natural generalization of both Yule’s model of biological speciation (Yule, 1925Yule G.U.

Emergence of scaling in random networks.Science. 1999; 286: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (25930) Google Scholar, Newman, 2005Newman M.E.J. Power laws, Pareto distributions and Zipf’s law.Contemp. Phys. 2005; 46: 323-351Crossref Scopus (3559) Google Scholar). It predicts that for large clique sizes k >> 1, their distribution follows a power law ∼k −γ with γ = 3. In agreement with this prediction, we measured γ = 2.94 ± 0.03 for the clique (COG) sizes in the supergenomic network (Figure S1I), which implies that its structure was consistent with preferential attachment. Because preferential attachment necessarily produces scale-free networks, in which all maximal cliques can be localized efficiently in computer time that scales linearly with network size (Eppstein et al., 2010Eppstein D. Loffler M. Strash D. Listing all maximal cliques in sparse graphs in near-optimal time.Proceedings of the 21st International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2010). 2010; 6506: 403-413Google Scholar), the model offers a rationale for the compressibility of supergenomic networks. In order to benchmark the performance of functional predictions, we next tested the ability to recover the activities of test proteins after hiding their Gene Ontology (GO) Molecular Function information from the network (leave-one-out experiments). The GID output was ranked by statistical Z scores. These scores were insensitive to compression error (Figure 2A) and were based on a normal approximation for the global distribution of reciprocal GID output log-ratios (Figure 2B, example in Figure 2C, and Extended Experimental Procedures). For comparison, we used two local and one global algorithm for sequence similarity networks. The local methods were PSI-BLAST sequence search (Altschul et al., 1997Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar), where all links from the full uncompressed network were allowed for matching, and the ranking of network COGs was by their average sequence similarity to the query protein (COG method). Because neither method takes into account contextual information, GID was limited to intrinsic evolutionary links for fair comparison. A set of 1,000 enzymes from the curated SwissProt collection of the UniProt database (UniProt Consortium, 2010UniProt ConsortiumThe Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) in 2010.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: D142-D148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar) defined the test set of the leave-one-out experiments. Over these experiments, we measured success by the average number of true positive predictions made prior to reaching 50 false predictions, or ACC50 accuracy values (Gribskov and Robinson, 1996Gribskov M. Robinson N.L. Use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate sequence matching.Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We found that GID Z scores above Z ∼2 were reliable indicators of functional accuracy (Figure 2D) giving accuracies that were 9% greater for GID than for PSI-BLAST (p < 9.2 × 10−17, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Figure 2E) and 21% more than with COGs (p < 1.7 × 10−11; Figure 2F). Our results showed that local algorithms on the full, uncompressed network (such as PSI-BLAST) yielded lower prediction accuracies than GID on the compressed network. We also benchmarked GID against an established global algorithm, RankProp (Melvin et al., 2009Melvin I. Weston J. Leslie C. Noble W.S. RANKPROP: a web server for protein remote homology detection.Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The iterative flow algorithm underlying RankProp was computationally intractable on the uncompressed supergenomic network, so RankProp was also applied to the intrinsic compressed network. In that test (Figure 2G), GID detected 5% more true matches than RankProp (p < 1.3 × 10−3). This further confirmed that compression is an essential step toward a global analysis of large networks, and that GID can improve function detection in comparison with other global methods. To predict novel molecular functions over many genomes, we used competitive GID (Venner et al., 2010Venner E. Lisewski A.M. Erdin S. Ward R.M. Amin S.R. Lichtarge O. Accurate protein structure annotation through competitive diffusion of enzymatic functions over a network of local evolutionary similarities.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e14286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) on the compressed supergenomic network: at any tested level of the GO hierarchy, the most likely molecular function was determined by the GO term with the highest significant Z score. Given the prior distribution of input functional labels (Figure S3A), we produced 92,892 significant predictions (with Z > 2) for 1,889 Molecular Function enzyme commission (EC) numbers in archaea (4% of predictions), bacteria (48%), and eukaryota (48%; see Table S1). Bacillus anthracis and P. falciparum, causative agents of anthrax and malaria, had the smallest numbers of genes annotated with GO Molecular Function terms compared to their total numbers of genes in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic categories, respectively (Figure S3B). This last case confirmed earlier observations that the majority of the P. falciparum 3D7 genome is difficult to annotate with biological function (Ochoa et al., 2011Ochoa A. Llinás M. Singh M. Using context to improve protein domain identification.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12: 90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To rank the importance of gene targets among the 305 P. falciparum functional predictions made with GID, we reviewed their number of references in the scientific literature (Table S2). This analysis highlighted EXP1 as the most cited P. falciparum gene with no known molecular function and for which we had a functional prediction.Figure S3Supergenomic Network Prediction and Experimental Validation of Function, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Functional distribution of initial input 315,692 GID labels for given EC numbers in the Molecular Function category before competitive GID.

When applied to EXP1, competitive GID predicted “catalytic activity” (Z = 2.39) as the only significant term at the highest GO level. Out of six main enzymatic classes, “transferase activity” (Z = 2.38) most strongly associated with EXP1 (Figures 3A and 3B and Table S2). No prediction from the transferase subclasses achieved a significant Z score, but three main functional clusters in eukaryotic integral membrane transferases emerged: glycosyltransferases (EC 2.4.1), protein kinases (EC 2.7), and microsomal glutathione S-transferases (GST, EC 2.5.1.18; Figure 3A). A search in the GO Biological Process category produced “glutathione metabolism” (Z = 2.88; Figures 3A and 3B). To identify the network sources of these predictions, we ordered all other protein nodes by their Z score distance to EXP1 (Table S3): the closest was a type 3 membrane GST from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (with 10% sequence identity to EXP1), leading to the prediction that EXP1 has a function akin to that of microsomal glutathione S-transferases (MGSTs). Guided by this prediction, we tested EXP1 in vitro for GST activity, after purifying the full-length protein expressed in Escherichia coli (Figures 3C and 3D). EXP1 was active in a detergent-solubilized form, and standard GST assay spectrophotometric measurements of EXP1 conjugating the thiol group of glutathione toward the benzene ring of the cytotoxic benzene derivative 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) yielded a specific activity of 8.72 ± 3.73 nmol min−1 mg−1 (Figures 3E and S3C).

Through RNAi screening, we identify an evolutionarily conserved and interferon-independent role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX17 in restricting Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-transmitted virus in the bunyavirus family that causes severe morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock. Loss of Drosophila DDX17 (Rm62) in cells and flies enhanced RVFV infection. Similarly, depletion of DDX17 but not the related helicase DDX5 increased RVFV replication in human cells. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq), we show that DDX17 binds the stem loops of host pri-miRNA to facilitate their processing and also an essential stem loop in bunyaviral RNA to restrict infection. Thus, DDX17 has dual roles in the recognition of stem loops: in the nucleus for endogenous microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and in the cytoplasm for surveillance against structured non-self-elements."

We assessed the carcinogenic effects of 300 MeV/n 28Si or 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions in a mouse model for radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma. C3H/HeNCrl mice were irradiated with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 1 Gy of 300 MeV/n 28Si ions, 600 MeV/n 56Fe ions or 1 or 2 Gy of protons simulating the 1972 solar particle event (1972SPE) at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory. Additional mice were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays at doses of 1, 2, or 3 Gy. All groups were followed until they were moribund or reached 800 days of age. We found that 28Si or 56Fe ions do not appear to be substantially more effective than gamma rays for the induction of acute myeloid leukemia. However, 28Si or 56Fe ion irradiated mice had a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma than gamma ray irradiated or proton irradiated mice. These data demonstrate a clear difference in the effects of these HZE ions on the induction of leukemia compared to solid tumors, suggesting potentially different mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Also seen in this study was an increase in metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in the 28Si and 56Fe ion irradiated mice compared with those exposed to gamma rays or 1972SPE protons, a finding with important implications for setting radiation exposure limits for space-flight crew members."

https://openalex.org/W1977959789,"A number of species-specific polymethyl-branched fatty acid-containing trehalose esters populate the outer membrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among them, 2,3-diacyltrehaloses (DAT) and penta-acyltrehaloses (PAT) not only play a structural role in the cell envelope but also contribute to the ability of M. tuberculosis to multiply and persist in the infected host, promoting the intracellular survival of the bacterium and modulating host immune responses. The nature of the machinery, topology, and sequential order of the reactions leading to the biosynthesis, assembly, and export of these complex glycolipids to the cell surface are the object of the present study. Our genetic and biochemical evidence corroborates a model wherein the biosynthesis and translocation of DAT and PAT to the periplasmic space are coupled and topologically split across the plasma membrane. The formation of DAT occurs on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane through the action of PapA3, FadD21, and Pks3/4; that of PAT occurs on the periplasmic face via transesterification reactions between DAT substrates catalyzed by the acyltransferase Chp2 (Rv1184c). The integral membrane transporter MmpL10 is essential for DAT to reach the cell surface, and its presence in the membrane is required for Chp2 to be active. Disruption of mmpL10 or chp2 leads to an important build-up of DAT inside the cells and to the formation of a novel form of unsulfated acyltrehalose esterified with polymethyl-branched fatty acids normally found in sulfolipids that is translocated to the cell surface."

https://openalex.org/W2041896468,"Helicobacter pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer and remains an important health care challenge. The trefoil factor peptides are a family of small highly conserved proteins that are claimed to play essential roles in cytoprotection and epithelial repair within the gastrointestinal tract. H. pylori colocalizes with MUC5AC at the gastric surface epithelium, but not with MUC6 secreted in concert with TFF2 by deep gastric glands. Both components of the gastric gland secretome associate non-covalently and show increased expression upon H. pylori infection. Although blood group active O-glycans of the Lewis-type form the basis of H. pylori adhesion to the surface mucin layer and to epithelial cells, α1,4-GlcNAc-capped O-glycans on gastric mucins were proposed to inhibit H. pylori growth as a natural antibiotic. We show here that the gastric glycoform of TFF2 is a calcium-independent lectin, which binds with high specificity to O-linked α1,4-GlcNAc-capped hexasaccharides on human and porcine stomach mucin. The structural assignments of two hexasaccharide isomers and the binding active glycotope were based on mass spectrometry, linkage analysis, (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, glycan inhibition, and lectin competition of TFF2-mucin binding. Neoglycolipids derived from the C3/C6-linked branches of the two isomers revealed highly specific TFF2 binding to the 6-linked trisaccharide in GlcNAcα1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-6(Fucα1-2Galβ1-3)GalNAc-ol(Structure 1). Supposedly, lectin TFF2 is involved in protection of gastric epithelia via a functional relationship to defense against H. pylori launched by antibiotic α1,4-GlcNAc-capped mucin glycans. Lectin-carbohydrate interaction may have also an impact on more general functional aspects of TFF members by mediating their binding to cell signaling receptors."

Heterozygosity can affect de-Bruijn graph assembly making de novo transcriptome assembly of species such as perennial ryegrass challenging. Creating a reference transcriptome from a homozygous perennial ryegrass genotype can circumvent the challenge of heterozygosity. The goals of this study were to perform RNA-sequencing on multiple tissues from a highly inbred genotype to develop a reference transcriptome. This was complemented with RNA-sequencing of a highly heterozygous genotype for SNP calling.De novo transcriptome assembly of the inbred genotype created 185,833 transcripts with an average length of 830 base pairs. Within the inbred reference transcriptome 78,560 predicted open reading frames were found of which 24,434 were predicted as complete. Functional annotation found 50,890 transcripts with a BLASTp hit from the Swiss-Prot non-redundant database, 58,941 transcripts with a Pfam protein domain and 1,151 transcripts encoding putative secreted peptides. To evaluate the reference transcriptome we targeted the high-affinity K+ transporter gene family and found multiple orthologs. Using the longest unique open reading frames as the reference sequence, 64,242 single nucleotide polymorphisms were found.

https://openalex.org/W2036787724,"Snakebites are a serious public health problem due their high morbi-mortality. The main available specific treatment is the antivenom serum therapy, which has some disadvantages, such as poor neutralization of local effects, risk of immunological reactions, high cost and difficult access in some regions. In this context, the search for alternative therapies is relevant. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antiophidic properties of Jatropha gossypiifolia, a medicinal plant used in folk medicine to treat snakebites. The aqueous leaf extract of the plant was prepared by decoction and phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of sugars, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenes and/or steroids and proteins. The extract was able to inhibit enzymatic and biologic activities induced by Bothrops jararaca snake venom in vitro and in vivo. The blood incoagulability was efficiently inhibited by the extract by oral route. The hemorrhagic and edematogenic local effects were also inhibited, the former by up to 56% and the latter by 100%, in animals treated with extract by oral and intraperitoneal routes, respectively. The inhibition of myotoxic action of B. jararaca reached almost 100%. According to enzymatic tests performed, it is possible to suggest that the antiophidic activity may be due an inhibitory action upon snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and/or serine proteinases (SVSPs), including fibrinogenolytic enzymes, clotting factors activators and thrombin like enzymes (SVTLEs), as well upon catalytically inactive phospholipases A2 (Lys49 PLA2). Anti-inflammatory activity, at least partially, could also be related to the inhibition of local effects. Additionally, protein precipitating and antioxidant activities may also be important features contributing to the activity presented. In conclusion, the results demonstrate the potential antiophidic activity of J. gossypiifolia extract, including its significant action upon local effects, suggesting that it may be used as a new source of bioactive molecules against bothropic venom."
https://openalex.org/W2004048431,"Introduction Acellular scaffolds are increasingly used for the surgical repair of tendon injury and ligament tears. Despite this increased use, very little data exist directly comparing acellular scaffolds and their native counterparts. Such a comparison would help establish the effectiveness of the acellularization procedure of human tissues. Furthermore, such a comparison would help estimate the influence of cells in ligament and tendon stability and give insight into the effects of acellularization on collagen. Material and Methods Eighteen human iliotibial tract samples were obtained from nine body donors. Nine samples were acellularized with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), while nine counterparts from the same donors remained in the native condition. The ends of all samples were plastinated to minimize material slippage. Their water content was adjusted to 69%, using the osmotic stress technique to exclude water content-related alterations of the mechanical properties. Uniaxial tensile testing was performed to obtain the elastic modulus, ultimate stress and maximum strain. The effectiveness of the acellularization procedure was histologically verified by means of a DNA assay. Results The histology samples showed a complete removal of the cells, an extensive, yet incomplete removal of the DNA content and alterations to the extracellular collagen. Tensile properties of the tract samples such as elastic modulus and ultimate stress were unaffected by acellularization with the exception of maximum strain. Discussion The data indicate that cells influence the mechanical properties of ligaments and tendons in vitro to a negligible extent. Moreover, acellularization with SDS alters material properties to a minor extent, indicating that this method provides a biomechanical match in ligament and tendon reconstruction. However, the given protocol insufficiently removes DNA. This may increase the potential for transplant rejection when acellular tract scaffolds are used in soft tissue repair. Further research will help optimize the SDS-protocol for clinical application."

In this study, CCN2, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), fibroblast activation protein (FAP), and keratin 19 (K19) expression was studied in 314 HCCs (cohort 1), 42 scirrhous HCCs (cohort 2), and 36 chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis specimens by immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological parameters were analyzed according to the expressions of these markers. In tumor epithelial cells from cohort 1, CCN2 and EMA were expressed in 15.3% and 17.2%, respectively, and their expressions were more frequent in HCCs with fibrous stroma (≥5% of tumor area) than those without (P<0.05 for all); CCN2 expression was well correlated with K19 and EMA expression. In tumor stromal cells, FAP expression was found in 6.7%. In cohort 2, CCN2, EMA, and FAP expression was noted in 40.5%, 40.5%, and 66.7%, respectively, which was more frequent than that in cohort 1 (P<0.05 for all). Additionally, EMA expression was associated with the expression of K19, CCN2, and FAP (P<0.05 for all); EMA expressing tumor epithelial cells showed a topographic closeness to FAP-expressing CAFs. Analysis of disease-free survival revealed CCN2 expression to be a worse prognostic factor in both cohort 1 (P = 0.005) and cohort 2 (P = 0.023), as well as EMA as a worse prognostic factor in cohort 2 (P = 0.048). In conclusion, expression of CCN2, EMA, and FAP may be involved in the activation of CAFs in HCC, giving rise to aggressive behavior. Significant correlation between EMA-expressing tumor cells and FAP-expressing CAFs and their topographic closeness suggests possible cross-talk between tumor epithelial cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2067667119,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common viral-associated neoplasm in which multiple signaling cascades are interfered with by Epstein-Bar virus (EBV) latent proteins and various genetic alterations. Aside from the previously reported PIK3CA amplification, we examined the role of INPP4B, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the development of NPC. By RT-PCR and Western blotting, we revealed that the expression of INPP4B was down-regulated in all five established EBV-positive tumor lines. While INPP4B was consistently expressed in normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, downregulation of INPP4B was found in 32/65 (49.2%) of primary tumors by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated the hypermethylation of the 5'CpG island of INPP4B in the tumors in which INPP4B transcription was downregulated. Notably, the re-expression of INPP4B was detected in the NPC cells treated with the demethylation agent (5-aza-2'deoxycytidine). Our study showed that promoter hypermethylation was the major mechanism for transcriptional silencing of INPP4B in NPC. Furthermore, restoration of INPP4B expression significantly suppressed PI3K/AKT downstream signals in the NPC C666-1 cells. In vivo growth inhibition was clearly demonstrated in the tumor cells stably expressing INPP4B. The findings indicate that epigenetic inactivation of INPP4B is one of the key mechanisms in activating PI3K/AKT signaling cascade and playing a role in the tumorigenesis of NPC."
https://openalex.org/W1963822045,"The majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with amino-terminal signal sequences. The presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex) mediates the import of these preproteins. The essential TIM23 core complex closely cooperates with partner protein complexes like the presequence translocase-associated import motor and the respiratory chain. The inner mitochondrial membrane also contains a large number of metabolite carriers, but their association with preprotein translocases has been controversial. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the TIM23 interactome based on stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture. Subsequent biochemical studies on identified partner proteins showed that the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier associates with the membrane-embedded core of the TIM23 complex in a stoichiometric manner, revealing an unexpected connection of mitochondrial protein biogenesis to metabolite transport. Our data indicate that direct TIM23-AAC coupling may support preprotein import into mitochondria when respiratory activity is low."
https://openalex.org/W2048018609,"Hereditary sensory neuropathies are a class of disorders marked by degeneration of the nerve fibers in the sensory periphery neurons. Recently, two mutations were identified in the subunits of the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin TRiC, a protein machine responsible for folding actin and tubulin in the cell. C450Y CCT4 was identified in a stock of Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas H147R CCT5 was found in a human Moroccan family. As with many genetically identified mutations associated with neuropathies, the underlying molecular basis of the mutants was not defined. We investigated the biochemical properties of these mutants using an expression system in Escherichia coli that produces homo-oligomeric rings of CCT4 and CCT5. Full-length versions of both mutant protein chains were expressed in E. coli at levels approaching that of the WT chains. Sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed chaperonin-sized complexes of both WT and mutant chaperonins, but with reduced recovery of C450Y CCT4 soluble subunits. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples of C450Y CCT4 revealed few ring-shaped species, whereas WT CCT4, H147R CCT5, and WT CCT5 revealed similar ring structures. CCT5 complexes were assayed for their ability to suppress aggregation of and refold the model substrate γd-crystallin, suppress aggregation of mutant huntingtin, and refold the physiological substrate β-actin in vitro. H147R CCT5 was not as efficient in chaperoning these substrates as WT CCT5. The subtle effects of these mutations are consistent with the homozygous disease phenotype, in which most functions are carried out during development and adulthood, but some selective function is lost or reduced.

C450Y CCT4 was identified in a stock of Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas H147R CCT5 was found in a human Moroccan family. As with many genetically identified mutations associated with neuropathies, the underlying molecular basis of the mutants was not defined. We investigated the biochemical properties of these mutants using an expression system in Escherichia coli that produces homo-oligomeric rings of CCT4 and CCT5. Full-length versions of both mutant protein chains were expressed in E. coli at levels approaching that of the WT chains. Sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed chaperonin-sized complexes of both WT and mutant chaperonins, but with reduced recovery of C450Y CCT4 soluble subunits. Electron microscopy of negatively stained samples of C450Y CCT4 revealed few ring-shaped species, whereas WT CCT4, H147R CCT5, and WT CCT5 revealed similar ring structures. CCT5 complexes were assayed for their ability to suppress aggregation of and refold the model substrate γd-crystallin, suppress aggregation of mutant huntingtin, and refold the physiological substrate β-actin in vitro. H147R CCT5 was not as efficient in chaperoning these substrates as WT CCT5. The subtle effects of these mutations are consistent with the homozygous disease phenotype, in which most functions are carried out during development and adulthood, but some selective function is lost or reduced."

Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying these events will be beneficial to direct the differentiation of stem cells into functional β-cells. Maturation of β-cells is accompanied by increased expression of MafA, an insulin gene transcription factor. Transcriptome analysis of MafA knockout islets revealed MafA is required for the expression of several molecules critical for β-cell function, including Glut2, ZnT8, Granuphilin, Vdr, Pcsk1 and Urocortin 3, as well as Prolactin receptor (Prlr) and its downstream target Cyclin D2 (Ccnd2). Inhibition of MafA expression in mouse islets or β-cell lines resulted in reduced expression of Prlr and Ccnd2, and MafA transactivated the Prlr promoter. Stimulation of β-cells by prolactin resulted in the phosphorylation and translocation of Stat5B and an increased nuclear pool of Ccnd2 via Prlr and Jak2. Consistent with these results, the loss of MafA resulted in impaired proliferation of β-cells at 4 weeks of age. These results suggest that MafA regulates the postnatal proliferation of β-cells via prolactin signaling."

Arginine and cysteine were identified as ligands by monitoring the conformational changes that occur upon amino acids binding to the ACT domain in the MaKat protein using FRET assay. It was found that MaKat is an amino acid-regulated protein acetyltransferase, whereas arginine and cysteine stimulated the activity of MaKat with regard to acetylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase (Micau_0428). Our research reveals the biochemical characterization of a protein acetyltransferase that contains a fusion of a GNAT domain with an ACT domain and provides a novel signaling pathway for regulating cellular protein acetylation.

https://openalex.org/W2005027841,"Diseases caused by many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens depend on the activities of bacterial effector proteins that are delivered into eukaryotic cells via specialized secretion systems. Effector protein function largely depends on specific subcellular targeting and specific interactions with cellular ligands. PDZ domains are common domains that serve to provide specificity in protein-protein interactions in eukaryotic systems. We show that putative PDZ-binding motifs are significantly enriched among effector proteins delivered into mammalian cells by certain bacterial pathogens. We use PDZ domain microarrays to identify candidate interaction partners of the Shigella flexneri effector proteins OspE1 and OspE2, which contain putative PDZ-binding motifs. We demonstrate in vitro and in cells that OspE proteins interact with PDLIM7, a member of the PDLIM family of proteins, which contain a PDZ domain and one or more LIM domains, protein interaction domains that participate in a wide variety of functions, including activation of isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). We demonstrate that activation of PKC during S. flexneri infection is attenuated in the absence of PDLIM7 or OspE proteins and that the OspE PDZ-binding motif is required for wild-type levels of PKC activation. These results are consistent with a model in which binding of OspE to PDLIM7 during infection regulates the activity of PKC isoforms that bind to the PDLIM7 LIM domain."
https://openalex.org/W1964795478,"Antibody responses have been classified as being either T cell-dependent or T cell-independent (TI). TI antibody responses are further classified as being either type 1 (TI-1) or type 2 (TI-2), depending on their requirement for B cell-mediated antigen receptor signaling. Although the mechanistic basis of antibody responses has been studied extensively, it remains unclear whether different antibody responses share similarities in their transcriptional regulation. Here, we show that mice deficient in IκB-ζ, specifically in their B cells, have impaired TI-1 antibody responses but normal T cell-dependent and TI-2 antibody responses. The absence of IκB-ζ in B cells also impaired proliferation triggered by Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation, plasma cell differentiation, and class switch recombination (CSR). Mechanistically, IκB-ζ-deficient B cells could not induce TLR-mediated induction of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a class-switch DNA recombinase. Retroviral transduction of AID in IκB-ζ-deficient B cells restored CSR activity. Furthermore, acetylation of histone H3 in the vicinity of the transcription start site of the gene that encodes AID was reduced in IκB-ζ-deficient B cells relative to IκB-ζ-expressing B cells. These results indicate that IκB-ζ regulates TLR-mediated CSR by inducing AID. Moreover, IκB-ζ defines differences in the transcriptional regulation of different antibody responses."
https://openalex.org/W1980731841,"Altered cardiac Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling is important in several experimental cardiovascular disorders. These studies have predominantly focused on cardiac myocytes or the heart as a whole. Cardiac fibroblasts have recently been attributed increasing significance in mediating inflammatory signaling. However, putative TLR9-signaling through cardiac fibroblasts remains non-investigated. Thus, our aim was to explore TLR9-signaling in cardiac fibroblasts and investigate the consequence of such receptor activity on classical cardiac fibroblast cellular functions. Cultivated murine cardiac fibroblasts were stimulated with different TLR9 agonists (CpG A, B and C) and assayed for the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], CXCL2 and interferon α/β). Expression of functional cardiac fibroblast TLR9 was proven as stimulation with CpG B and -C caused significant CXCL2 and TNFα-release. These responses were TLR9-specific as complete inhibition of receptor-stimulated responses was achieved by co-treatment with a TLR9-antagonist (ODN 2088) or chloroquine diphosphate. TLR9-stimulated responses were also found more potent in cardiac fibroblasts when compared with classical innate immune cells. Stimulation of cardiac fibroblasts TLR9 was also found to attenuate migration and proliferation, but did not influence myofibroblast differentiation in vitro. Finally, results from in vivo TLR9-stimulation with subsequent fractionation of specific cardiac cell-types (cardiac myocytes, CD45+ cells, CD31+ cells and cardiac fibroblast-enriched cell-fractions) corroborated our in vitro data and provided evidence of differentiated cell-specific cardiac responses. Thus, we conclude that cardiac fibroblast may constitute a significant TLR9 responder cell within the myocardium and, further, that such receptor activity may impact important cardiac fibroblast cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2055611853,"SATB1 is essential for T-cell development and growth and metastasis of multitype tumors and acts as a global chromatin organizer and gene expression regulator. The DNA binding ability of SATB1 plays vital roles in its various biological functions. We report the crystal structure of the N-terminal module of SATB1. Interestingly, this module contains a ubiquitin-like domain (ULD) and a CUT repeat-like (CUTL) domain (ULD-CUTL tandem). Detailed biochemical experiments indicate that the N terminus of SATB1 (residues 1-248, SATB1((1-248))), including the extreme 70 N-terminal amino acids, and the ULD-CUTL tandem bind specifically to DNA targets. Our results show that the DNA binding ability of full-length SATB1 requires the contribution of the CUTL domain, as well as the CUT1-CUT2 tandem domain and the homeodomain. These findings may reveal a multiple-domain-coordinated mechanism whereby SATB1 recognizes DNA targets."
https://openalex.org/W2070400969,"FgfrL1 is the fifth member of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (Fgfr) family. Studies with FgfrL1 deficient mice have demonstrated that the gene plays an important role during embryonic development. FgfrL1 knock-out mice die at birth as they have a malformed diaphragm and lack metanephric kidneys. Similar to the classical Fgfrs, the FgfrL1 protein contains an extracellular part composed of three Ig-like domains that interact with Fgf ligands and heparin. However, the intracellular part of FgfrL1 is not related to the classical receptors and does not possess any tyrosine kinase activity. Curiously enough, the amino acid sequence of this domain is barely conserved among different species, with the exception of three motifs, namely a dileucine peptide, a tandem tyrosine-based motif YXXΦ and a histidine-rich sequence. To investigate the function of the intracellular domain of FgfrL1, we have prepared genetically modified mice that lack the three conserved sequence motifs, but instead contain a GFP cassette (FgfrL1ΔC-GFP). To our surprise, homozygous FgfrL1ΔC-GFP knock-in mice are viable, fertile and phenotypically normal. They do not exhibit any alterations in the diaphragm or the kidney, except for a slight reduction in the number of glomeruli that does not appear to affect life expectancy. In addition, the pancreas of both FgfrL1ΔC-GFP knock-in and FgfrL1 knock-out mice do not show any disturbances in the production of insulin, in contrast to what has been suggested by recent studies. Thus, the conserved motifs of the intracellular FgfrL1 domain are dispensable for organogenesis and normal life. We conclude that the extracellular domain of the protein must conduct the vital functions of FgfrL1."
https://openalex.org/W1996028527,"The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor hASH1, encoded by the ASCL1 gene, plays an important role in neurogenesis and tumor development. Recent findings indicate that local oxygen tension is a critical determinant for the progression of neuroblastomas. Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the oxygen-dependent expression of hASH1 in neuroblastoma cells. Exposure of human neuroblastoma-derived Kelly cells to 1% O2 significantly decreased ASCL1 mRNA and hASH1 protein levels. Using reporter gene assays, we show that the response of hASH1 to hypoxia is mediated mainly by post-transcriptional inhibition via the ASCL1 mRNA 5′- and 3′-UTRs, whereas additional inhibition of the ASCL1 promoter was observed under prolonged hypoxia. By RNA pulldown experiments followed by MALDI/TOF-MS analysis, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP)-A2/B1 and hnRNP-R as interactors binding directly to the ASCL1 mRNA 5′- and 3′-UTRs and influencing its expression. We further demonstrate that hnRNP-A2/B1 is a key positive regulator of ASCL1, findings that were also confirmed by analysis of a large compilation of gene expression data. Our data suggest that a prominent down-regulation of hnRNP-A2/B1 during hypoxia is associated with the post-transcriptional suppression of hASH1 synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W2027151509,"miRNA155 has been implicated in normal T cell function and their differentiations into the Th1 subtype. We have shown that acute alcohol (ethanol) intoxication combined with burn injury suppresses T cell IFN-γ release. Herein, we examined whether the decrease in IFN-γ is resulted from altered expression of miRNA155 and transcription factors--NFAT, Tbx21, Jun and Fos--in T cells following ethanol and burn injury. Mice received ethanol (∼3 g/Kg) 4 hours prior to ∼12.5% total body surface area sham or burn injury and were sacrificed one day after injury. Splenic T cells were harvested and cultured with anti-CD3 (2 µg/ml) in the presence or absence of rIL-12 (10 ng/ml) or PMA (10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (50 ng/ml) for 48 hours. We observed a significant decrease in miRNA155, NFAT, Tbx21, Jun and Fos expression as well as IFN-γ release in T cells cultured with anti-CD3 following ethanol and burn injury compared with shams. The co-treatment of T cells with rIL-12 prevented the decrease in IFN-γ and NFAT, Tbx21, Jun and Fos, but not miRNA155. In contrast, the co-treatment with PMA plus ionomycin normalized the expression of NFAT. It did not prevent the decrease in IFN-γ, Tbx21, Jun, Fos and miRNA155. Finally, results obtained in miRNA155-/- mice did not show any change in T cell release of IFN-γ or expression of nuclear factors compared to wildtype mice. Together, these findings suggest that while ethanol and burn injury decreases the expression of miRNA155, it may not be involved in decreased IFN-γ under those conditions."

So, after decades spent happily working in laboratories, how did I end up in the Saudi desert, trying to do science at a petrochemical plant? My long career with a developer of petrochemical processing technology began as a research chemist at its main research center near Chicago, Illinois. It was—is—a very fine laboratory. We were able to turn out accurate results quickly. An array of pilot plants ran smoothly, cranking out data 24/7. Complex experiments were designed, and definitive conclusions were drawn efficiently.

“Things that are easy in the research lab … are hard in the field.” 

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

In time I took on a new role, helping develop collaborations with other companies in the United States and abroad. This was a fundamental shift for me: While I was still deeply involved in solving scientific problems, there was a new focus on building relationships. Then, a few years ago, someone got the bright idea that I should join a technical team to diagnose and solve performance problems at a customer's propane dehydrogenation facility, which my company had designed, while the plant remained up and running. It was a formidable challenge, and a lot was on the line.

In some ways, I was not an obvious choice. I knew little about the technology. I had never worked in the field, in a production unit. No one cared. Those encouraging me to join the team praised my “vast expertise and experience.” They said my “fresh eyes” would be a benefit to the team. I fell for the flattery and signed on.

After a crash review of the technology, I embarked on the first of three 2-week site visits to Al Jubail on the Persian Gulf coast. Major culture shock. All women there wear full burqas; no faces are seen and no interaction permitted, so you are cut off from half of society. Everything is forced to close during prayer times. Inappropriate dress, even by men, results in a public reprimand from a local cop. I had been to Muslim countries before, but this was far more intense. It was jarring and isolating but also fascinating. And it was HOT.

You'd think that removing two little hydrogen atoms from propane to make propylene would be simple. It is not. Propane wants to keep them. The dehydrogenation facility is big and incredibly complicated: huge, hot catalytic reactors, multiple gas separation towers, gas purification units, and cooling systems, together covering four city blocks. It's loud and scary, and a lot different from the state-of-the-art laboratory I was used to.

I knew going in that to succeed I must build respectful, somewhat personal, working relationships with the local staff. Pretending to know everything (or anything) would be a bad idea; it's much better to ask questions and dig for answers together. Cultural sensitivity was crucial. My first visit, during the fasting month of Ramadan, required some particularly difficult adaptations: If you must eat or drink water during the day, please be discrete.

Things that are easy in the research lab, I learned, are hard in the field. Reliable data are crucial in any investigation, but much harder to obtain in an operational industrial facility. A research pilot plant designed for liters per day is way different than a facility producing hundreds of tons per day. There is much you cannot do: You can't take samples from just any point in the process, or change operating conditions just to see what happens. Staff members may lack the experience necessary to avoid subtle problems in sampling and analysis. Data are often so uncertain, so clouded by events, that interpretation becomes more art than science, or impossible. I organized a series of conference calls with our analytical experts back home, reviewing and improving procedures alongside local staff. We made progress and improved relationships.

When troubleshooting complex systems—systems that encompass not just science and technology but also people and relationships—there may be many culprits. By addressing root causes of disparate problems, our team made important improvements. And I learned plenty.
