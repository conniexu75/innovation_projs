https://openalex.org/W2046347466,"Characterization of the chloroplast proteome is needed to understand the essential contribution of the chloroplast to plant growth and development. Here we present a large scale analysis by nanoLC-Q-TOF and nanoLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) of ten independent chloroplast preparations from Arabidopsis thaliana which unambiguously identified 1325 proteins. Novel proteins include various kinases and putative nucleotide binding proteins. Based on repeated and independent MS based protein identifications requiring multiple matched peptide sequences, as well as literature, 916 nuclear-encoded proteins were assigned with high confidence to the plastid, of which 86% had a predicted chloroplast transit peptide (cTP). The protein abundance of soluble stromal proteins was calculated from normalized spectral counts from LTQ-Obitrap analysis and was found to cover four orders of magnitude. Comparison to gel-based quantification demonstrates that 'spectral counting' can provide large scale protein quantification for Arabidopsis. This quantitative information was used to determine possible biases for protein targeting prediction by TargetP and also to understand the significance of protein contaminants. The abundance data for 550 stromal proteins was used to understand abundance of metabolic pathways and chloroplast processes. We highlight the abundance of 48 stromal proteins involved in post-translational proteome homeostasis (including aminopeptidases, proteases, deformylases, chaperones, protein sorting components) and discuss the biological implications. N-terminal modifications were identified for a subset of nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded proteins and a novel N-terminal acetylation motif was discovered. Analysis of cTPs and their cleavage sites of Arabidopsis chloroplast proteins, as well as their predicted rice homologues, identified new species-dependent features, which will facilitate improved subcellular localization prediction. No evidence was found for suggested targeting via the secretory system. This study provides the most comprehensive chloroplast proteome analysis to date and an expanded Plant Proteome Database (PPDB) in which all MS data are projected on identified gene models."
https://openalex.org/W2003493421,"A fundamental challenge in understanding how dendritic spine morphology controls learning and memory has been quantifying three-dimensional (3D) spine shapes with sufficient precision to distinguish morphologic types, and sufficient throughput for robust statistical analysis. The necessity to analyze large volumetric data sets accurately, efficiently, and in true 3D has been a major bottleneck in deriving reliable relationships between altered neuronal function and changes in spine morphology. We introduce a novel system for automated detection, shape analysis and classification of dendritic spines from laser scanning microscopy (LSM) images that directly addresses these limitations. The system is more accurate, and at least an order of magnitude faster, than existing technologies. By operating fully in 3D the algorithm resolves spines that are undetectable with standard two-dimensional (2D) tools. Adaptive local thresholding, voxel clustering and Rayburst Sampling generate a profile of diameter estimates used to classify spines into morphologic types, while minimizing optical smear and quantization artifacts. The technique opens new horizons on the objective evaluation of spine changes with synaptic plasticity, normal development and aging, and with neurodegenerative disorders that impair cognitive function."
https://openalex.org/W2118232570,"Functional brain imaging studies have indicated that distinct anatomical brain regions can show coherent spontaneous neuronal activity during rest. Regions that show such correlated behavior are said to form resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs have been investigated using seed-dependent functional connectivity maps and by using a number of model-free methods. However, examining RSNs across a group of subjects is still a complex task and often involves human input in selecting meaningful networks.We report on a voxel based model-free normalized cut graph clustering approach with whole brain coverage for group analysis of resting-state data, in which the number of RSNs is computed as an optimal clustering fit of the data. Inter-voxel correlations of time-series are grouped at the individual level and the consistency of the resulting networks across subjects is clustered at the group level, defining the group RSNs. We scanned a group of 26 subjects at rest with a fast BOLD sensitive fMRI scanning protocol on a 3 Tesla MR scanner.An optimal group clustering fit revealed 7 RSNs. The 7 RSNs included motor/visual, auditory and attention networks and the frequently reported default mode network. The found RSNs showed large overlap with recently reported resting-state results and support the idea of the formation of spatially distinct RSNs during rest in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2154960142,"Changes in the number, size, and shape of dendritic spines are associated with synaptic plasticity, which underlies cognitive functions such as learning and memory. This plasticity is attributed to reorganization of actin, but the molecular signals that regulate this process are poorly understood. In this study, we show neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) regulates the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. N-WASP localized to spines and active, functional synapses as shown by loading with FM4–64 dye. Knock down of endogenous N-WASP expression by RNA interference or inhibition of its activity by treatment with a specific inhibitor, wiskostatin, caused a significant decrease in the number of spines and excitatory synapses. Deletion of the C-terminal VCA region of N-WASP, which binds and activates the actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex, dramatically decreased the number of spines and synapses, suggesting activation of the Arp2/3 complex is critical for spine and synapse formation. Consistent with this, Arp3, like N-WASP, was enriched in spines and excitatory synapses and knock down of Arp3 expression impaired spine and synapse formation. A similar defect in spine and synapse formation was observed when expression of an N-WASP activator, Cdc42, was knocked down. Thus, activation of N-WASP and, subsequently, the Arp2/3 complex appears to be an important molecular signal for regulating spines and synapses. Arp2/3-mediated branching of actin could be a mechanism by which dendritic spine heads enlarge and subsequently mature.

Communication between neurons occurs at highly specialized cell-cell junctions called synapses. These structures are composed of pre- and post-synaptic terminals that allow for propagation of signals between neurons and are the basis for the complex circuitry found in the central nervous system. Postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses consist of actin-rich dendritic spines (1Matus A. Ackermann M. Pehling G. Byers H.R. Fujiwara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7590-7594Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) that are small extensions from the dendrite that form connections with axonal terminals. Abnormalities in dendritic spines are associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including mental retardation, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and Alzheimer disease, pointing to the importance of these structures in the central nervous system (2Fiala J.C. Spacek J. Harris K.M. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2002; 39: 29-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Morphological changes in dendritic spines due to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton are thought to be important for synaptic function and, thus, integrating information flow within the brain (3Fischer M.

Despite considerable interest, the molecular mechanisms that regulate spine morphology and synapse formation via modulation of the actin cytoskeleton are poorly understood.

These proteins initiate the nucleation of new actin filaments through activation of the Arp2/3 complex (7Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D.

New filaments generated by the Arp2/3 complex are formed at fixed angles to the mother filament, creating a branched actin network that is commonly found in protrusive regions of cells (9Mullins R.D.

C-terminal sequences within N-WASP, consisting of a verprolin-like homology domain (V), a central domain (C), and an acidic region (A), mediate binding of G-actin and the Arp2/3 complex to these proteins, which subsequently results in actin nucleation (7Machesky L.M.

N-WASP, as its name implies, is highly expressed in the brain, but its function in the nervous system is not well understood (13Miki H. Miura K. Takenawa T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5326-5335Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In this study, we show a crucial function for N-WASP in the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. This activity of N-WASP is dependent on its C-terminal binding and activation of the Arp2/3 complex. Inhibition of Arp2/3 binding to N-WASP resulted in a significant reduction in the density of spines and synapses. Decreased expression of the N-WASP activator Cdc42 also caused a defect in the formation of spines and synapses. Thus, our results point to a critical role for activated N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex in the development of dendritic spines and synapses in the central nervous system.

Cell Culture and Transfection—Hippocampal low density cultures were prepared as described previously (18Goslin, K., Asmussen, H., and Banker, G. (1998) in Rat Hippocampal Neurons in Low-density Culture (Banker, G., and Goslin, K., eds) pp. 339-370, MIT Press, Cambridge, MAGoogle Scholar). Neurons were plated at a density of 70,000 cells/mm2 and transfected by a modified calcium phosphate method (19Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunohistochemistry and Image Analysis—For most antibodies, neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/4% glucose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. Coverslips were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and washed three times with PBS. For PSD-95 staining, neurons were fixed for 3 min with paraformaldehyde/glucose and then permeabilized for 10 min in cold methanol at -20 °C. Coverslips were then blocked for 1 h with 20% goat serum in PBS. Antibodies were diluted in 5% goat serum in PBS and incubated at the indicated dilutions for 1 h followed by three washes with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). In all experiments, at least 40 dendrites from 15–20 neurons from three different cultures were analyzed to quantify the number of spines, SV2 clusters, and PSD-95 clusters. Neurons were imaged with a Retiga EXi CCD camera (QImaging, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada) attached to an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Melville, NY) with a ×60 objective (numerical aperture 1.45). Image acquisition was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) interfaced with a Lambda 10-2 automated controller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). For enhanced GFP and Alexa Fluor® 488, an Endow GFP Bandpass filter cube (excitation HQ470/40, emission HQ525/50, Q495LP dichroic mirror) (Chroma, Brattleboro, VT) was used. Rhodamine and Alexa Fluor® 555 were imaged with a TRITC/Cy3 cube (excitation HQ545/30, emission HQ610/75, Q570LP dichroic mirror). FM4–64 Loading and Destaining—Day 12 neurons were incubated with 0.5 μm FM4–64 FX in high K+ solution containing 72 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm NaH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 11 mm d-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.35, for 3 min. Neurons were then washed three times with calcium-free solution, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/glucose for 15 min, and visualized in fluorescence. N-WASP Is Enriched in Excitatory Synapses in Hippocampal Neurons—The expression of N-WASP has been shown to increase dramatically in the rat hippocampus during the first several weeks after birth (20Tsuchiya D. Kitamura Y. Takata K. Sugisaki T. Taniguchi T. Uemura K. Miki H. Takenawa T. Shimohama S. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 56: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a time when dendritic spines and synapses are developing. This led us to hypothesize that this molecule plays an important role in spine and synapse formation. To begin to test our hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of N-WASP in hippocampal neurons by immunostaining low density cultures with N-WASP antibody along with a presynaptic marker, SV2, or a postsynaptic marker, PSD-95. The synaptic vesicle protein SV2 is found in presynaptic terminals of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, whereas the postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 localizes to the postsynaptic side of shaft and spine excitatory endings. Endogenous N-WASP accumulated in puncta along neuronal processes with both SV2 and PSD-95 (Fig. 1A, arrows). Because it is difficult to determine from the lower magnification images whether N-WASP puncta were completely merged or were in close apposition to the synaptic markers, higher magnification images were generated. As shown in the higher magnification images, N-WASP puncta were in close apposition to the presynaptic marker SV2, suggesting it was in postsynaptic terminals (Fig. 1A). Consistent with this, N-WASP puncta almost completely merged with the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 (Fig. 1A), indicating that N-WASP localizes to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses. Although most N-WASP localized to excitatory synapses, a fraction of N-WASP puncta were negative for PSD-95. These puncta might represent N-WASP protein complexes that have been described previously in non-neuronal cells (21Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The localization of GFP-N-WASP to synapses was examined by transfecting neurons with a GFP-tagged N-WASP construct. The GFP tag was shown previously to have no effect on N-WASP localization (22Moreau V. Frischknecht F. Reckmann I. Vincentelli R. Rabut G. Stewart D. Way M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Like endogenous N-WASP, GFP-N-WASP co-localized in clusters with PSD-95 and was in close apposition to SV2 puncta (Fig. 1B, arrows, and supplemental Fig. S1), confirming that GFP-N-WASP localizes similarly to the endogenous molecule and is a valid maker for examining N-WASP localization in the neurons. Our results indicate that N-WASP is enriched in the postsynaptic terminal of excitatory synapses. However, some of the SV2 and PSD-95 puncta lacked N-WASP, which led us to quantify the number of SV2 and PSD-95 clusters that contained N-WASP puncta. Approximately 55% of the SV2 clusters and ∼66% of the PSD-95 clusters contained N-WASP (Fig. 1B), indicating that N-WASP is present in a majority of the SV2 and PSD-95 clusters. Similar results were obtained with GFP-N-WASP. This raised the question as to whether the N-WASP-containing clusters were activity-dependent, functional synapses. FM4–64 is a member of a family of styryl dyes that can be used as fluorescent probes to visualize active synapses (23Betz W.J. Mao F. Smith C.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 24Betz W.J. Bewick G.S. Science. 1992; 255: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). These dyes exhibit prominent fluorescence upon insertion of their hydrophobic tails into a lipid bilayer but can easily be washed out due to their inability to cross bilayers (25Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). When a cell surface is exposed to an FM dye and then washed with a dye-free solution, only membranes that are no longer surface-exposed retain the fluorescent dye (25Cochilla A.J. Angleson J.K. Betz W.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Thus, the activity-dependent uptake of FM dyes into synaptic vesicles provides a useful marker for functional synapses in cultured neurons (26Betz W.J. Mao F. Bewick G.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 363-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To determine whether N-WASP-containing clusters were functional synapses, neurons expressing GFP-N-WASP were labeled with FM4–64. Day 12 neurons were incubated with 0.5 μm FM4–64 in high K+ solution for 3 min and then washed three times with calcium-free solution. As expected, FM4–64 puncta, which represented functional synapses, were observed along the dendrites. However, when neurons were incubated with the dye in a buffer lacking K+, FM4–64 puncta were not observed, indicating that FM4–64 uptake is dependent on depolarization. As shown in Fig. 1C, N-WASP puncta localized with FM4–64. Quantification of these results showed that 85.0 ± 3.5% of the FM4–64-labeled synapses contained N-WASP, demonstrating that N-WASP was in most of the active synapses. Thus, our results indicate N-WASP is present in the postsynaptic side of active, functional, excitatory synapses that could undergo changes in morphology mediated by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. N-WASP Regulates Dendritic Spine Morphology and the Formation of Excitatory Synapses—To examine the function of N-WASP in the neurons, we treated cultures with a specific inhibitor of N-WASP, wiskostatin, and determined the density of synapses and spines by staining with SV2 and phalloidin, respectively. Wiskostatin stabilizes the autoinhibited form of the protein so that the C-terminal VCA domains are not available to bind G-actin and the Arp2/3 complex to initiate new actin filaments (28Peterson J.R. Bickford L.C. Morgan D. Kim A.S. Ouerfelli O. Kirschner M.W. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When neurons were treated with wiskostatin at day 7 and then fixed and immunostained at day 12, a dose-dependent decrease in the number of spines and synapses was observed (Fig. 2A). Wiskostatin did not adversely affect the health of the neurons, because they were observed to develop normally and no detectable effects on the growth of axons or dendrites were seen at any of the wiskostatin concentrations used. Interestingly, we noticed that at the highest concentration of wiskostatin (5 μm) many of the remaining synapses were concentrated around the neuronal cell bodies. It has been reported previously that inhibitory GABAergic synapses are most dense around the cell body and form directly on the dendrite or cell soma surface without a spine (29Craig A.M. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Banker G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12373-12377Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), which led us to look further at the type of synapses that were regulated by N-WASP activity. To examine the effect of wiskostatin treatment on inhibitory synapses, we used GAD-6 antibody to immunostain for glutamic acid decarboxylase. Glutamic acid decarboxylase localizes to the presynaptic side of inhibitory synapses and catalyzes the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). There was no significant difference in the number of inhibitory GABAergic synapses with wiskostatin treatment (Fig. 2B), indicating that N-WASP activation is not necessary for the formation of these synapses. In contrast, wiskostatin treatment had a significant effect on the density of excitatory glutamatergic synapses as the number of PSD-95 puncta was decreased by >50% (Fig. 2C). Because excitatory synapses can form on dendritic spines or on the dendritic shaft, we assessed the effects of wiskostatin treatment on each of these types of excitatory synapses. Wiskostatin treatment decreased the number of excitatory synapses that formed on spines by almost 90% (20.4 ± 1.7 in controls versus 2.3 ± 0.6 in wiskostatin-treated) but had no significant effect on shaft synapses (20.2 ± 1.7 in controls versus 19.6 ± 1.6 in wiskostatin-treated). In these experiments, neurons were treated for 5 days with wiskostatin to ensure that N-WASP activity was inhibited during a critical time when many spines and synapses form. However, treatment of the neurons for a shorter period of time also resulted in a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses. We added 5 μm wiskostatin to the neuronal cultures at day 7, washed out the wiskostatin at day 8, and stained for PSD-95 and phalloidin at day 12. The 1-day wiskostatin treatment caused a 51% decrease in the number of spines (17.9 ± 1.0 in controls versus 8.7 ± 0.6 in wiskostatin-treated) and a 30% reduction in the number of synapses (37.5 ± 1.8 in controls versus 26.2 ± 1.7 in wiskostatin-treated). Taken together, our results suggest that activation of N-WASP is important for the regulation of spine morphogenesis and the formation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. We generated an RNAi construct to knock down expression of endogenous N-WASP to further explore the role of N-WASP in dendritic spine and synapse formation. The RNAi sequence had been shown previously to be specific for N-WASP and to almost completely knock down expression of the protein (30Yamaguchi H. Lorenz M. Kempiak S. Sarmiento C. Coniglio S.

However, we confirmed the ability of the RNAi construct to specifically knock down rat N-WASP expression by transiently transfecting it into HEK-293T cells along with GFP-tagged rat N-WASP or WAVE1. As determined by immunoblot analysis, the N-WASP RNAi construct decreased expression of N-WASP by >85% compared with empty pSUPER vector (Fig. 3A, left panels). In contrast, a scrambled RNAi control had no effect on expression of N-WASP (Fig. 3A, right panels). The N-WASP RNAi construct did not affect expression of WAVE1, another WASP family member, indicating its specificity for N-WASP (Fig. 3A, middle panels). The RNAi construct was similarly effective in decreasing expression of N-WASP in the neurons. Transfection of neurons with N-WASP RNAi resulted in an 87.2 ± 4.8% decrease in N-WASP expression compared with control cultures. When neurons were transfected with the N-WASP RNAi construct at day 6 and then fixed and stained for SV2 and PSD-95 at day 12, a 2- to 3-fold decrease in the number of dendritic spines and synapses was observed compared with cells expressing a scrambled RNAi construct or empty pSUPER vector (Fig. 3, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S2). To further show that the effects of N-WASP RNAi were specifically attributable to the loss of N-WASP, rescue experiments were performed in which bovine N-WASP was co-expressed with N-WASP RNAi. The rat N-WASP RNAi target sequence does not significantly affect expression of bovine N-WASP due to several nucleotide mismatches (30Yamaguchi H. Lorenz M. Kempiak S. Sarmiento C. Coniglio S. Symons M. Segall J. Eddy R. Miki H. Takenawa T. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Expression of bovine N-WASP completely rescued the N-WASP RNAi-mediated defect in spine and synapse formation (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the defect is due to the loss of endogenous N-WASP and point to a critical role for N-WASP in spine and synapse formation. The Actin and Arp2/3 Binding Domains of N-WASP Are Critical for Its Function in Regulating Spine and Synapse Formation—We next used several deletion constructs of N-WASP to determine the domains of the protein necessary for spine and synapse formation. For these experiments, the synaptic density was determined by staining for both SV2 and PSD-95 and the number of spines was assessed by GFP fluorescence as well as staining with phalloidin. Phalloidin, which binds F-actin and is commonly used to visualize dendritic spines (3Fischer M. Kaech S. Knutti D. Matus A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 847-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 33Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I. Spector I. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2423-2436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used to assess spine density because it is possible that the GFP-tagged fragments of N-WASP differentially localize to spines. Interestingly, similar results for the spine density were observed with both methods. The C terminus of N-WASP is composed of two verprolin homology (V) domains, which bind G-actin; a central (C) domain; and an acidic (A) region that binds the Arp 2/3 complex (7Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 8Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). The VCA region of N-WASP, which we refer to as “WA,” is sufficient to stimulate the nucleation of new actin filaments by the Arp2/3 complex (7Machesky L.M. Mullins R.D. Higgs H.N. Kaiser D.A. Blanchoin L. May R.C. Hall M.E. Pollard T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 8Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP-N-WASP caused a small but significant increase in the density of dendritic spines and synapses compared with GFP alone (Fig. 4, B and C). Expression of N-WASP lacking the C-terminal VCA region (ΔWA) significantly decreased the number of spines and synapses compared with control neurons expressing GFP, but protrusions were still observed along the dendrites of N-WASP-ΔWA-expressing neurons (Fig. 4, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S3). Protrusions were defined as extensions from the dendrites without associated presynaptic endings whereas dendritic spines were in contact with presynaptic terminals. In contrast, expression of N-WASP lacking the N-terminal WH1 region (ΔWH1) did not significantly affect the density of spines or synapses as compared with controls (Fig. 4, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP promotes spine and synapse formation in the neurons and could be a mechanism by which dendritic spine heads enlarge and subsequently mature. To further explore the function of the WA region in spine and synapse formation, we transfected neurons with a construct encoding the C-terminal region (WA) of N-WASP. Expression of the WA region resulted in a slight decrease in the density of spines and synapses. In neurons expressing the WA region, a 14% decrease in the number of spines, as determined by staining with phalloidin, and a 25% reduction in the synaptic density, as determined by staining with PSD-95, was observed when compared with cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 4, B and C). However, significantly more spines and synapses were observed in neurons expressing the WA region than with cells expressing truncated N-WASP that lacked the C-terminal WA region, suggesting that the WA region of N-WASP is critical for its function in spine and synapse formation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP is critical for the formation of dendritic spines and synapses. Cdc42 Plays a Role in the Development of Dendritic Spines and Synapses—Because the Rho family GTPase Cdc42 is a known activator of N-WASP (34Symons M. Derry J.M. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A. Cell. 1996; 84: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), we explored its function in regulating spine and synapse formation by preparing an RNAi construct to knock down expression of Cdc42 in neurons. We tested the ability of the Cdc42 RNAi construct to knock down expression of the endogenous protein by transfecting it into Rat2 fibroblasts. Immunoblot analysis showed that the RNAi construct decreased expression of Cdc42 by >75% compared with control pSUPER vector (Fig. 5A, left panels). In contrast, a scrambled RNAi construct did not significantly affect expression of Cdc42 (Fig. 5A, right panels). When neurons were transfected with the Cdc42 RNAi construct, a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses was observed compared with cells transfected with a scrambled RNAi construct or empty pSUPER vector (Fig. 5, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S4). A similar decrease in the density of spines and synapses was observed in neurons expressing dominant negative Cdc42 (Fig. 5, B and C). The Cdc42 RNAi-mediated defect in spine and synapse formation could be rescued, at least partially, by expression of the WA region of N-WASP, linking Cdc42 to N-WASP activation in the development of spines and synapses (Fig. 5, B and C). Arp3 Regulates the Formation of Spines and Synapses in Hippocampal Neurons—Because our results strongly implicated the Arp2/3 complex as a downstream effector of N-WASP in spine and synapse formation, we examined its subcellular localization in hippocampal neurons. GFP-tagged Arp3, one of the seven proteins found in the Arp2/3 complex, localized in puncta along neuronal processes with SV2 and PSD-95, suggesting that it was synaptic (Fig. 6A, arrows). A similar localization was observed by immunostaining for endogenous Arp3 and SV2 (Fig. 6A). Higher magnification images showed that Arp3 puncta were in close apposition to SV2 clusters and completely merged with PSD-95 puncta, indicating that Arp3, like N-WASP, is enriched on the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses (Fig. 6A). Because Arp3 localized to spines and excitatory synapses, we generated an RNAi construct to examine its function in regulating the formation of these structures. Although the RNAi sequence had been shown previously to effectively knock down expression of Arp3 (35Steffen A. Faix J. Resch G.P. Linkner J. Wehland J. Small J.V. Rottner K. Stradal T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2581-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we tested its ability to knock down rat Arp3 by transfecting it into HEK-293T cells with GFP-tagged Arp3. The Arp3 RNAi construct decreased expression of Arp3 by almost 80% whereas a scrambled RNAi control did not affect Arp3 expression (Fig. 6B). When neurons were transfected with the Arp3 RNAi construct, a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses was observed compared with control cultures expressing scrambled RNAi or empty pSUPER vector (Fig. 6C and supplemental Fig. S5). The decrease in the density of spines and synapses in neurons expressing the Arp3 RNAi construct was similar to that observed when N-WASP expression was knocked down in these cells. Thus, our results suggest that N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex are important regulators in the formation of dendritic spines and synapses. Our results reveal a novel mechanism by which N-WASP activation of the Arp2/3 complex regulates the formation of dendritic spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. N-WASP is enriched in spines and excitatory synapses that are active and functional as determined by loading with FM4–64 dye. Knock down of endogenous N-WASP resulted in a significant decrease in the density of spines and synapses. The C-terminal region of the protein, which binds and activates the Arp2/3 complex, is critical for this function of N-WASP. Knock down of Arp3, an important protein in the Arp2/3 complex, caused a similar defect in the formation of spines and synapses, pointing to the significance of activation of the Arp2/3 complex in this process. An activator of N-WASP, Cdc42, is also involved in regulating spine and synapse formation. Knock down of Cdc42 expression resulted in a significant decrease in the number of spines and synapses and expression of the WA region of N-WASP rescued the Cdc42-mediated defect in spine and synapse formation, suggesting that activation of N-WASP by Cdc42 is important in this process. Thus, our study provides a molecular mechanism by which N-WASP and an activator and effector regulate the development of dendritic spines and synapses. The function of Cdc42 in regulating the development of spines and synapses is presently unclear. Recent studies have indicated a role for Cdc42 in dendritic morphogenesis in Drosophila and learning-related synaptic growth in Aplysia sensory neurons (36Scott E.K. Reuter J.E. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Udo H. Jin I. Kim J.H. Li H.L. Youn T. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R. Bailey C.H. Neuron. 2005; 45: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of Cdc42 is proposed to be an important event in converting nonfunctional contacts into functional synapses (38Shen W. Wu B. Zhang Z. Dou Y. Rao Z.R. Chen Y.R. Duan S. Neuron. 2006; 50: 401-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, others have suggested that Cdc42 does not have a significant effect on the maintenance of dendritic spine morphology in hippocampal neurons (39Tashiro A. Minden A. Yuste R. Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 40Govek E.E. Newey S.E. Akerman C.J. Cross J.R. Van der Veken L. Van Aelst L. Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with Cdc42 regulating the formation of dendritic spines and synapses. The previous studies in hippocampal neurons relied on expression of constitutively active and dominant negative Cdc42 mutants after many spines and synapses had formed (day 10–12 in culture), whereas our study used RNAi to specifically knock down Cdc42 expression during a time when many spines and synapses are actively forming (day 5–6 in culture). It may be difficult to see a dramatic effect of Cdc42 on spines and synapses after a significant number of them have already formed. Our results show that the spine and synaptic density in the WA-expressing neurons was slightly decreased compared with neurons expressing full-length N-WASP. It was reported previously that the WA region alone is much more potent in stimulating actin polymerization by the Arp2/3 complex than full-length N-WASP (8Rohatgi R. Ma L. Miki H. Lopez M. Kirchhausen T. Takenawa T. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 221-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Delocalized reorganization of actin may limit the amount of G-actin and Arp2/3 complex available for actin assembly at synaptic sites, which could diminish the ability of spines to stabilize and mature. Consistent with this, aberrant actin reorganization has been reported to result in a decrease in the density of spines and synapses in neurons (19Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 41Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Niu S. Horwitz A.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3379-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The process of spine formation has received a great deal of interest because of the importance of these structures in cognitive function, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate spine formation still remain poorly understood. Our results suggest that activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP is critical for the formation of dendritic spines and synapses. This raises the question of how the Arp2/3 complex functions in spine and synapse formation. Although the exact steps in spinogenesis are not clear, it appears that spines can either form from dendritic protrusions or extend directly from the dendritic shaft (42Dailey M.E. Smith S.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2983-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 44Fiala J.C.

In both cases, the spine head enlarges or expands as the spine matures, and the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branching of actin may play an important role in this process. When activation of the Arp2/3 complex by N-WASP is inhibited, the formation of dendritic spines is impaired. Activation of the Arp2/3 complex may form a branched actin network that promotes and supports the enlargement and maturation of the spine head. This branched actin network may also be important for the morphological changes in spines associated with synaptic plasticity. Future studies are needed to better understand the complex regulation of actin and its contribution to the formation and plasticity of spines and synapses. In a proteomic analysis of rat brain, members of the Arp2/3 complex were shown to be present in the postsynaptic density (28Peterson J.R. Bickford L.C. Morgan D. Kim A.S. Ouerfelli O. Kirschner M.W. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our results showing that the Arp2/3 complex localizes to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses where activation by N-WASP and Cdc42 supports enlargement of spine heads. Although the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate activation of Cdc42 and, subsequently, branching of actin through the Arp2/3 complex are unknown, several Cdc42 GEFs could function in this capacity. Both α- and β-p-21-activated kinase-interacting exchange factor, which are Cdc42 and Rac GEFs, localize to the postsynaptic terminals of excitatory synapses where they regulate spine morphogenesis (19Zhang H. Webb D.J. Asmussen H. Horwitz A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 47Node-Langlois R. Muller D. Boda B. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 19220-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Another Cdc42 GEF, intersectin, localizes to dendritic spines and plays a role in their development (49Nishimura T. Yamaguchi T. Tokunaga A. Hara A. Hamaguchi T. Kato K. Iwamatsu A. Okano H. Kaibuchi K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1273-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other Cdc42 GEFs may contribute to this process. In summary, we show that activation of N-WASP regulates the formation of dendritic spines and synapses through the Arp2/3 complex. The activation of the Arp2/3 complex could stimulate spine development by forming a branched actin network that promotes the enlargement of spine heads and leads to their maturation.

In this study we found an inverse correlation between EZH2 and RUNX3 gene expression in five cancer cell lines, i.e. gastric, breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed an association between EZH2 bound to the RUNX3 gene promoter, and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27, and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) bound to the RUNX3 gene promoter in cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in a decrease in H3K27 trimethylation and unbound HDAC1 and an increase in expression of the RUNX3 gene. Restoration of RUNX3 expression was not associated with any change in DNA methylation status in the RUNX3 promoter region. RUNX3 was repressed by histone deacetylation and hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region and restored by trichostatin A or/and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed restoration of expression of the RUNX3 protein after knockdown of EZH2 and its restoration resulted in decreased cell proliferation. In vivo, an inverse relationship between expression of the EZH2 and RUNX3 proteins was observed at the individual cell level in gastric cancer patients in the absence of DNA methylation in the RUNX3 promoter region. The results showed that RUNX3 is a target for repression by EZH2 and indicated an underlying mechanism of the functional role of EZH2 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation.

Three members of the Runt-related (RUNX) family of genes, RUNX1, RUNX2, and RUNX3, play pivotal roles in normal development and neoplasia.

A. 2003; 100: 11606-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), and because it is a biomarker of tumor progression, EZH2 has also been suggested to be an oncogene that leads to tumor development. EZH2 competes with histone deacetylase in binding to retinoblastoma protein 2/p130 and subsequently reduces the transcriptional repression of the CyclinA promoter, suggesting a molecular mechanism linking elevated EZH2 expression to malignant transformation (20Tonini T. Bagella L. D'Andrilli G. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4930-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the downstream signaling and molecular mechanism for the aberrant expression of EZH2 in cancer has been poorly understood. RUNX3 has been found to up-regulate p21WAF1/Cip1, an important factor in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition and cell cycle control, and has been found to do so in collaboration with Smads downstream of transforming growth factor-β in gastric cancer (21Chi X.Z. Yang J.O. Lee K.Y. Ito K. Sakakura C. Li Q.L. Kim H.R. Cha E.J. Lee Y.H. Kaneda A. Ushijima T. Kim W.J. Ito Y. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8097-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). RUNX3 is also responsible for transcriptional up-regulation of Bim in transforming growth factor-β-induced apoptosis (22Yano T. Ito K. Fukamachi H. Chi X.Z. Wee H.J. Inoue K. Ida H. Bouillet P. Strasser A. Bae S.C. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4474-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, RUNX3 plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis as well as in the regulation of cell growth arrest, suggesting that RUNX3 is a significant tumor suppressor gene in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the role that EZH2 plays in cancer cell proliferation in several different cancer cell lines and found that EZH2 is a transcriptional repressor of RUNX3 expression and acts synergistically with DNA methylation. Cell Culture—Five human cancer cell lines, i.e. gastric cancer cell line MKN28, breast cancer cell line MCF-7, prostate cancer cell line LNCap, colon cancer cell line DLD1, and pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca2, were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Tissue Specimens—A total of 17 gastric cancer specimens (stage IA, 3; IB, 4; II, 2; IIIA, 3; IIIB, 2; and IV, 3; 8 intestinal-type adenocarcinomas and 9 diffuse-type adenocarcinomas) and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric mucosa were studied. The specimens were obtained from 8 males and 9 females (mean age 62.8 years; range 52–77 years) by surgical resection at the National Cancer Hospital East and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until examined. The histological diagnosis was confirmed by microscopic analysis of a section of each frozen specimen before DNA extraction. None of the patients had any preoperative treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy. All patients agreed to enrollment in the study and gave their informed consent. The institutional review board of the National Cancer Center approved all protocols after obtaining the patients' consent. All clinicopathological data were according to the TNM classification (UICC) and obtained from the clinical and pathology records. RNA Interference—Two different 21-nucleotides duplex siRNAs for EZH2 and one negative control siRNA were synthesized by Ambion (EZH2; siRNA ID 107417 and 214022). Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were transfected with EZH2 siRNA or control siRNA using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent (DHARMACON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At various time points after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to several assays, including real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis. RNA Isolation and Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA from the five different cell lines was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA with ExScript RT Reagent (Takara). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with specific primers for EZH2 and RUNX3 and Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). GAPDH expression was used to normalize for variance. Real-time fluorescence monitoring of the PCR products was performed with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (Takara). The expression levels of specific genes are reported as ratios of expression of GAPDH in the same master reaction. The PCR primer pairs (5′ to 3′) used for each gene were: EZH2, CCCTGACCTCTGTCTTACTTGTGGA and ACGTCAGATGGTGCCAGCAATA; RUNX3, TCTGTAAGGCCCAAAGTGGGTA and ACCTCAGCATGACAATATGTCACAA; GAPDH, GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC and ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGT. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (23Fujii S. Luo R.Z. Yuan J. Kadota M. Oshimura M. Dent S.R. Kondo Y. Issa J.P. Bast Jr., R.C. Yu Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 1791-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions for the RUNX3 gene promoter were applied with the following two primer pairs (5′ to 3′): ChIP primer 1, TGTCCCGGGATCCTCTTCT and TAGAGACGTTGGTGCGGAAAT and ChIP primer 2, CTCTCTGCTCTCCCCTCAAAAC and GGACCGTGGTTACATGCGTAA. These primer sets were designed to encompass the transcriptional start site of RUNX3 variant 2 in the CpG island. A 5 μg amount of each antibody was used in this assay. The antibodies used were EZH2 antibody and dimethyl H3 (Lys9) antibody, purchased from Abcam Inc., and HDAC1 antibody and trimethyl H3 (Lys27) antibody, purchased from Upstate. Individual ChIP assays were repeated at least twice to confirm the reproducibility of the PCR-based experiment. Preliminary PCR were performed to determine the optimal PCR conditions to assure linear amplification of DNA. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. To measure the levels of EZH2, HDAC1, and histone methylation (K9 and K27) in each immunoprecipitate, the ratios were calculated by measuring the intensity of the PCR product in immunoprecipitated DNA versus input DNA (total chromatin) amplified by PCR in a linear range. The ratios were calculated by performing a DNA 1000 assay with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and using DNA chips for electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies). The MYT1 (myelin transcription factor 1) gene was used as a positive control to validate each ChIP assay. The MYT1 gene has been found to be a target gene of EZH2 (24Herman J.G. Graff J.R.

DNA Extraction—Genomic DNA from the five cancer cell lines and the 17 gastric cancer specimens and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric mucosa was extracted with a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen). Analysis of the Methylation Status of Genomic DNA—Bisulfite treatment of the DNA for the methylation assays was performed as previously described (25Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Methylation of RUNX3 was determined by a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). Briefly, 2 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA was used as the PCR template, and primer sets specific for methylated and unmethylated alleles were used. The MSP primers for RUNX3 used in this study have been described previously (7Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C. Fukamachi H. Inoue K. Chi X.Z. Lee K.Y. Nomura S. Lee C.W. Han S.B. Kim H.M. Kim W.J.

The PCR products from the methylated and unmethylated reactions were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunofluorescence—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and processed for immunofluorescence. Rabbit antibody against EZH2 (1:125) (Zymed Laboratories) and mouse antibody against RUNX3 (1 μg/ml) (R3–6E9) (26Ito K. Liu Q. Salto-Tellez M. Yano T. Tada K. Ida H. Huang C. Shah N. Inoue M.

The donkey secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa Fluor 488, and the goat secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 546 (Molecular Probes). Cells were examined with a Zeiss LSM5 PASCAL microscope and nuclear contour ratios were computed. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with whole cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and then frozen at -80 °C and thawed three times to rupture the cell membranes. Samples of the lysates were incubated for 30 min on ice to lyse the nuclei and then centrifuged at 8900 × g. The protein concentration of each sample was determined by a standard Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) from each cell line were subjected to Western blot analysis. The probing antibodies were EZH2 antibody (1:1000) (BD Transduction Laboratories), RUNX3 antibody (1 μg/ml) (R3–5G4) (26Ito K. Liu Q. Salto-Tellez M. Yano T. Tada K. Ida H. Huang C. Shah N. Inoue M.

Cell Treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA) and 5-Aza-dC— Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the maximum concentration tolerated of TSA and 5-aza-dC by each cell line, and TSA concentrations in the 330 nm to 5 μm range and 5-aza-dC concentrations in the 800 nm to 1 μm range were optimal for the cancer cell lines. TSA concentrations of 330 nm were used for MCF-7 and MiaPaca2 cells, 1 μm for LNCap and DLD1 cells, and 5 μm for MKN28 cells, and the 5-aza-dC concentrations used were 800 nm for MCF-7 cells and 1 μm for MKN28, LNCap, DLD1, and MiaPaca2 cells. Cells were seeded at low density in a 35-mm tissue culture dish and incubated at 37 °C for a total of 72 h. Cells were incubated for 24 h prior to treatment with the chemicals. Mock treatment with an identical volume of absolute ethanol or water was used as a control. The 5-aza-dC was added after 24 h of incubation and cells were incubated for 48 h after it was added. TSA was added to the medium after 24 h of incubation, and cells were incubated with TSA for 48 h. When 5-aza-dC and TSA were both added, they were added after incubation for 24 h, and cells were incubated for 48 h. The culture medium was exchanged every 24 h for 5-aza-dC, TSA, and the combined treatment. Total cellular RNA was extracted for real-time PCR analysis. Cell Proliferation Assay—The five cancer cell lines were transfected with EZH2 siRNA or control siRNA 48 h before the cell proliferation assay. The cell proliferation assay was started by seeding the cells at a density of 1.0 × 105 per dish. The assay was subsequently processed by incubating the cells at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator for 72, 96, 120, and 144 h after transfection, and counting the cells to plot a cell growth curve. Immunohistochemistry—The same 17 gastric adenocarcinoma specimens as used for MSP analysis were used for immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry for EZH2 (1:25) (BD Transduction Laboratories) and RUNX3 (1 μg/ml) (R3–6E9) (26Ito K. Liu Q. Salto-Tellez M. Yano T. Tada K. Ida H. Huang C. Shah N. Inoue M. Rajnakova A.

Specimens were scored negative for overexpression of EZH2 when 0–20% of the cells were positive, and positive for overexpression when >21% cells were positive. Specimens were scored positive for RUNX3 expression and negative. For RUNX3 expression, specimens were also evaluated with the localization of RUNX3 expression, nucleus or cytoplasm. Appropriate positive and negative internal controls were used to validate immunohistochemical staining. Inhibitory Effect of EZH2 on RUNX3 Gene Expression—To determine whether EZH2 is a negative modulator of RUNX3 gene expression in the five cancer cell lines, i.e. gastric cancer line MKN28, breast cancer line MCF-7, prostate cancer line LNCap, colon cancer line DLD1, and pancreatic cancer line MiaPaca2, EZH2 mRNA was suppressed with EZH2 siRNA in all five cancer cell lines, in which RUNX3 is silenced (7Li Q.L.

The results of RT-PCR showed significantly decreased levels of EZH2 mRNA in all five cancer cell lines within 48–96 h after transfection with EZH2 siRNA (the percentage of EZH2 mRNA expression level by EZH2 siRNA transfection to that by control siRNA transfection; MKN28, 31.6%; MCF-7, 25.7%; LNCap, 31.5%; DLD1, 50.0%; MiaPaca2, 47.0%) (Fig. 1A, a–e). A marked decrease in EZH2 protein level in all five cancer cell lines was observed by Western blot 96 h after transfection (data not shown), an increased level of RUNX3 mRNA was in every line. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantitatively measure the restored RUNX3 mRNA expression level after knockdown of EZH2 (Fig. 1A, f–j). RUNX3 mRNA had increased from 3.5 to 10.4-fold after EZH2 knockdown in the cancer cell lines (MKN28, 4.7-fold; MCF-7, 6.1-fold; LNCap, 10.4-fold; DLD1, 4.1-fold; MiaPaca2, 3.5-fold) (Fig. 1A, f–j). However, the transcriptional expression level of GAPDH mRNA was unchanged in all five cancer cell lines after EZH2 knockdown, suggesting that GAPDH is not a target of EZH2 (data not shown). By non-real-time RT-PCR, restoration of RUNX3 mRNA expression in the MKN28 cells was visualized on 6% PAGE (Fig. 1B). ChIP Assay—To demonstrate a direct interaction between the EZH2 complex and promoter region of the RUNX3 gene, a ChIP assay was performed using the same MKN28 and MCF-7 cells. Two PCR primer sets that spanned the transcriptional start site were used to monitor binding of EZH2 to the promoter that drives expression of RUNX3 mRNA and was up-regulated after loss of EZH2. The MYT1 gene was used as a positive control to validate each ChIP assay (25Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The ChIP assay revealed EZH2 binding to the RUNX3 promoter region in the control MKN28 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A, a and b), and the amount of the EZH2 recruited to the promoter region of RUNX3 was inversely correlated with the RUNX3 mRNA expression levels in both cell lines. The level of H3-Lys27 trimethylation in the RUNX3 promoter was significantly reduced in MKN28 and MCF-7 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA, and the decrease in H3-Lys27 trimethylation was inversely correlated with the increase in expression of the RUNX3 gene. The amount of HDAC1 bound to the RUNX3 promoter was also significantly reduced in MKN28 and MCF-7 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA, and the decrease in HDAC1 was inversely correlated with an increase in expression of the RUNX3 gene, suggesting that EZH2 forms a transcriptional repressive complex with HDAC1. A decreased level of H3-Lys9 dimethylation was also detected in MKN28 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA in comparison with MKN28 cells transfected with control siRNA, suggesting that H3-Lys9 status may also be involved in modulation of the RUNX3 gene promoter activity by EZH2. Based on all of the above findings, we concluded that RUNX3 gene silencing in cancer cells is mediated by EZH2 increasing the H3-Lys27 methylation level. Fig. 2A, c, shows that the binding levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 (H3-Lys27 trimethylation) in the MYT1 promoter region, which is known to be a target of EZH2 (25Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Kuzmichev A. Margueron R. Reinberg D. Green R. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1592-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), clearly decreased after knockdown of EZH2, suggesting the ChIP assay was valid. The means and standard deviations of ChIP experiments for each antibody were shown as diagrams (supplemental Fig. S1). MSP Analysis—As previously reported, hypermethylation in the RUNX3 promoter region was observed in all five cancer cell lines in the absence of RUNX3 expression (Fig. 2B) (7Li Q.L. Ito K. Sakakura C.

We then investigated whether the status of DNA methylation in the RUNX3 promoter region changed after knockdown of EZH2 and resulted in restoration of RUNX3 gene expression. Although RUNX3 was up-regulated after EZH2 siRNA transfection, as shown in Fig. 2B the MSP analysis showed no decrease in DNA methylation of the RUNX3 promoter region. Hypermethylation of the promoter of the RUNX3 gene occurred before and after EZH2 siRNA transfection in all five cancer cell lines examined. DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region is known to be associated with silencing of the RUNX3 gene, however, the above findings suggest that histone modification by EZH2 also played an important role in"
https://openalex.org/W1989995599,"Background DNA damage such as double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) has been reported to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. The major player in response to DSBs is ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated). Upon sensing DSBs, ATM is activated through autophosphorylation and phosphorylates a number of substrates for DNA repair, cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. ATM has been reported to phosphorylate the α subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which senses AMP/ATP ratio in cells, and can be activated by upstream kinases. Here we provide evidence for a novel role of ATM in mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK activation in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage. Methodology/Principal Findings Three pairs of human ATM+ and ATM- cells were employed. Cells treated with etoposide exhibited an ATM-dependent increase in mitochondrial mass as measured by 10-N-Nonyl-Acridine Orange and MitoTracker Green FM staining, as well as an increase in mitochondrial DNA content. In addition, the expression of several known mitochondrial biogenesis regulators such as the major mitochondrial transcription factor NRF-1, PGC-1α and TFAM was also elevated in response to etoposide treatment as monitored by RT-PCR. Three pieces of evidence suggest that etoposide-induced mitochondrial biogenesis is due to ATM-dependent activation of AMPK. First, etoposide induced ATM-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK α subunit at Thr172, indicative of AMPK activation. Second, inhibition of AMPK blocked etoposide-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. Third, activation of AMPK by AICAR (an AMP analogue) stimulated mitochondrial biogenesis in an ATM-dependent manner, suggesting that ATM may be an upstream kinase of AMPK in the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that activation of ATM by etoposide can lead to mitochondrial biogenesis through AMPK activation. We propose that ATM-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis may play a role in DNA damage response and ROS regulation, and that defect in ATM-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis could contribute to the manifestations of A-T disease."
https://openalex.org/W2055713680,"Store depletion induces STIM1 to aggregate and relocate into clusters at ER-plasma membrane junctions where it functionally interacts with and activates plasma membrane channels that mediate store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Thus, the site of peripheral STIM1 clusters is critical for the regulation of SOCE. However, what determines the location of the STIM1 clusters in the ER-PM junctional regions, and whether these represent specific sites in the cell is not yet known. Here we report that clustering of STIM1 in the subplasma membrane region of the cell and activation of TRPC1-dependent SOCE are determined by lipid raft domains (LRD). We show that store depletion increased partitioning of TRPC1 and STIM1 into plasma membrane LRD. TRPC1 and STIM1 associated with each other within the LRD, and this association was dynamically regulated by the status of the ER Ca(2+) store. Peripheral STIM1 clustering was independent of TRPC1. However, sequestration of membrane cholesterol attenuated thapsigargin-induced clustering of STIM1 as well as SOCE in HSG and HEK293 cells. Recruitment and association of STIM1 and TRPC1 in LRD was also decreased. Additionally STIM1(D76A), which is peripherally localized and constitutively activates SOCE in unstimulated cells, displayed a relatively higher partitioning into LRD and interaction with TRPC1, as compared with STIM1. Disruption of membrane rafts decreased peripheral STIM1(D76A) puncta, its association with TRPC1 and the constitutive SOCE. Together, these data demonstrate that intact LRD determine targeting of STIM1 clusters to ER-plasma membrane junctions following store depletion. This facilitates the functional interaction of STIM1 with TRPC1 and activation of SOCE."
https://openalex.org/W2015666741,"The two most prominent neutral lipids of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, triacylglycerols (TAG) and steryl esters (SE), are synthesized by the two TAG synthases Dga1p and Lro1p and the two SE synthases Are1p and Are2p. In this study, we made use of a set of triple mutants with only one of these acyltransferases active to elucidate the contribution of each single enzyme to lipid particle (LP)/droplet formation. Depending on the remaining acyltransferases, LP from triple mutants contained only TAG or SE, respectively, with specific patterns of fatty acids and sterols. Biophysical investigations, however, revealed that individual neutral lipids strongly affected the internal structure of LP. SE form several ordered shells below the surface phospholipid monolayer of LP, whereas TAG are more or less randomly packed in the center of the LP. We propose that this structural arrangement of neutral lipids in LP may be important for their physiological role especially with respect to mobilization of TAG and SE reserves."
https://openalex.org/W1989964995,"The procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan that normally dwells in the midgut of its insect vector. In vitro, this parasite prefers d-glucose to l -proline as a carbon source, although this amino acid is the main carbon source available in its natural habitat. Here, we investigated how l -proline is metabolized in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted conditions. Analysis of the excreted end products of 13C-enriched l -proline metabolism showed that the amino acid is converted into succinate or l -alanine depending on the presence or absence of d-glucose, respectively. The fact that the pathway of l -proline metabolism was truncated in glucose-rich conditions was confirmed by the analysis of 13 separate RNA interference-harboring or knock-out cell lines affecting different steps of this pathway. For instance, RNA interference studies revealed the loss of succinate dehydrogenase activity to be conditionally lethal only in the absence of d-glucose, confirming that in glucose-depleted conditions, l -proline needs to be converted beyond succinate. In addition, depletion of the F0/F1-ATP synthase activity by RNA interference led to cell death in glucose-depleted medium, but not in glucose-rich medium. This implies that, in the presence of d-glucose, the importance of the F0/F1-ATP synthase is diminished and ATP is produced by substrate level phosphorylation. We conclude that trypanosomes develop an elaborate adaptation of their energy production pathways in response to carbon source availability.

Trypanosomatids are parasitic protozoa, among which several species cause serious diseases in humans such as sleeping sickness (Trypanosoma brucei), Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). These pathogenic trypanosomatids have developed a digenetic lifestyle with one or several vertebrate hosts (including humans) and a hematophagous insect vector that allows their transmission between vertebrate hosts. Recently, the genome sequencing projects of T. brucei (TREU927 strain) (1Berriman M. Ghedin E. Hertz-Fowler C. Blandin G. Renauld H. Bartholomeu D.C. Lennard N.J. Caler E. Hamlin N.E. Haas B.

Science. 2005; 309: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Trypanosomatids depend on the carbon sources present in their hosts for their energy metabolism (4Bringaud F. Rivière L. Coustou V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). For example, the trypomastigote forms of T. brucei and T. cruzi (bloodstream forms) use d-glucose, which is abundant in the fluids of their vertebrate host(s) (5Cannata J.J. Cazzulo J.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 1984; 79: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 6Fairlamb A.H. Opperdoes F.R. Morgan M.J. Carbohydrate Metabolism in Cultured Cells. Plenum Publishing Corp, New York1986Google Scholar). In contrast, the insect vectors obtain their energy from l -proline and/or l -glutamine, the prominent constituent of their hemolymph and tissue fluids (7Bursell E. The Role of Proline in Energy Metabolism. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 183-224Google Scholar). Consequently, the insect stages of T. brucei and T. cruzi rely on amino acid catabolism, with a preference for l -proline. However, these parasites prefer d-glucose when grown in medium rich in this sugar. Because glucose-rich media are routinely used to grow these parasites, d-glucose metabolism has received the most attention, and relatively little is known about their amino acid metabolism. Recent advances in understanding about trypanosomatid catabolism have focused on procyclic T. brucei, which has significant overlap with other species regarding its metabolism, but for which RNA interference (RNAi) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; FRDg, glycosomal fumarate reductase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MEc, cytosolic malic enzyme; MEm, mitochondrial malic enzyme; ATPϵ-F1β, F1 complex β-subunit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 2The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; FRDg, glycosomal fumarate reductase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MEc, cytosolic malic enzyme; MEm, mitochondrial malic enzyme; ATPϵ-F1β, F1 complex β-subunit; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. has been extensively developed.

Succinate represents ∼70% of the excreted end products of d-glucose metabolism. It is produced in the glycosomes (peroxisome-like organelles specialized in d-glucose metabolism in trypanosomatids) and the mitochondrion by two NADH-dependent fumarate reductase isoforms, FRDg and FRDm1 (mitochondrial NADH-dependent fumarate reductase), respectively (10Besteiro S.

It has been proposed that the procyclic form of T. brucei, as well as other trypanosomatids, adapts its energy metabolism to available carbon sources (4Bringaud F. Rivière L. Coustou V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); however, this view has been recently questioned (19van Weelden S.W.H. van Hellemond J.J. Opperdoes F.R. Tielens A.G.M.

Here, we illustrate the metabolic flexibility of procyclic trypanosomes by comparing their l -proline metabolism when grown in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted media. In glucose-rich conditions, the l -proline degradation pathway is truncated, and complexes II and IV of the respiratory chain and the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase become of greatly reduced significance to the energy pathways of the cell. We conclude that d-glucose availability leads to down-regulation of the proline degradation pathway, along with proton flow through the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase and electron flow through the respiratory chain (in addition to negative regulation of the rate of l -proline consumption). Trypanosome and Cell Cultures—The procyclic form of T. brucei EATRO1125 was cultured at 27 °C in SDM79 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 3.5 mg/ml hemin (21Brun R.

SDM80 medium is supplemented with 9% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum dialyzed by ultrafiltration against 0.15 m NaCl (molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da; Sigma F0392; d-glucose concentration of 1 mm) and 1% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (d-glucose concentration of 5 mm).

The pLew-SDH-SAS construct targets a fragment (bp 12–452) of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) gene (Tb09.160.4380). Briefly, a PCR-amplified 524-bp fragment containing the antisense SDH sequence (440 bp of targeted sequence plus 96 bp used as a spacer to form the loop between the annealing sense and antisense sequences, respectively) with restriction sites added to the primers was inserted into the HindIII and BamHI restriction sites of the pLew100 plasmid. Then, a PCR-amplified 474-bp fragment containing the sense SDH sequence was inserted upstream of the antisense sequence using HindIII and XhoI restriction sites (XhoI was introduced at the 3′-extremity of the antisense PCR fragment). The resulting plasmid (pLew-SDH-SAS) contains a sense and antisense version of the targeted gene fragment, separated by a 96-bp fragment, under the control of the PARP promoter linked to a prokaryotic tetracycline operator. The pLew-PDH.E2-SAS plasmid (designed to inhibit, by RNAi, the expression of the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex) was generated in the pLew79 vector with the same strategy described above, employing the same restriction sites. The targeting cassette is composed of a sense and antisense version of the Tb10.6k15.3080 gene (bp 69–632), separated by an 84-bp fragment. To target inhibition of expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene (Tb927.2.4210), the 3′-end of the coding sequence and the 3′-untranslated region were selected. The targeted sequences correspond to the last 130 bp (bp 1448–1578 of the PEPCK gene) of the coding sequence followed by 197 bp of the 3′-untranslated region. The sense and antisense fragments, separated by 40 bp, were cloned into the pLew100 vector. To simultaneously target both malic enzyme genes, which encode the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms (MEc (Tb11.02.3120) and MEm (Tb11.02.3130), respectively), we selected a fragment from the MEc gene (bp 427–824) that showed the highest homology to the MEm gene (80% identity). The sense and antisense fragments, separated by 26 bp, were cloned in the pLew100 vector. To inhibit expression of the mitochondrial F0/F1-ATP synthase, the sense and antisense versions of a fragment (bp 471–934) of the β-subunit gene of the F1 complex (ATPϵ-F1β; Tb927.3.1380), separated by a 58-bp fragment, were cloned into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of the p2T7Ti-177 vector. Trypanosome Transfection, Adaptation to SDM80 Medium, and RNAi Induction—The EATRO1125 procyclic form cell line (EATRO1125.T7T), constitutively expressing the T7 RNA polymerase gene and the tetracycline repressor under the control of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for tetracycline-inducible expression (23Bringaud F.

Trypanosome transfection and selection of phleomycin-resistant clones were performed as reported previously (27Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, all of the RNAi-harboring cell lines were selected in glucose-rich SDM79 medium containing hygromycin B (25 μg/ml), neomycin (10 μg/ml), and phleomycin (5 μg/ml). Aliquots of each were frozen in liquid nitrogen to provide stocks of each line that had not been cultivated long term in medium. The selected cell lines were then adapted to glucose-rich SDM80glu medium and glucose-depleted SDM80 medium containing the same concentration of the three antibiotics. The cell lines were first transferred to SDM80glu medium and maintained for at least 2 weeks before adaptation to SDM80 medium. All analyzed cell lines were maintained for 2 weeks in SDM80 or SDM80glu medium before addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline for RNAi induction.

Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (1:10,000 dilution) was used as a secondary antibody, and revelation was performed using ECL™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. For quantitative analyses, membranes or x-ray films were scanned, and protein bands were quantified using NIH Image software. Determination of Sensitivity to Metabolic Drugs—EATRO1125 procyclic cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in SDM80 medium either containing or lacking 6 mm d-glucose in the presence of decreasing quantities of rotenone (from 0.5 mm to 20 nm), salicylhydroxamic acid (from 10 mm to 1.5 μm), potassium cyanide (from 10 mm to 80 nm), malonate (from 10 mm to 80 nm), and oligomycin (from 50 μg/ml to 0.01 ng/ml). The assay was performed in 96-well microtiter plates with 100 μl of cell suspension/well, and the cell viability was determined optically. The drug concentration required to kill all of the cells (100% lethal dose, LD100) was determined 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days after drug addition. d-Glucose and l -Proline Measurements—To determine the rate of d-glucose and l -proline consumption, cells (inoculated at 1–1.5 × 107 cells/ml) were grown in 10 ml of SDM80 (0.15 mm d-glucose) or SDM80glu (6.15 mm d-glucose) medium. Aliquots of each growth medium (500 μl) were collected 0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 23, and 24 h after incubation at 27 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in 500 μl of 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The quantity of d-glucose present in the medium was determined using the Glucose GOD-PAP kit (Biolabo S.A.). l -Proline concentration was determined with a colorimetric assay as described previously (36Bates L.S.

At 0, 9, and 24 h, the cell density and cellular protein concentration were determined to estimate the amount of carbon source consumed per mg of cellular protein. NMR Experiments—6 × 108 T. brucei procyclic cells were collected by centrifugation at 1400 × g for 10 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and incubated in 30 ml of incubation buffer (PBS supplemented with 24 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3). For the analysis of d-glucose metabolism, the cells were incubated for 6 h at 27°C in incubation buffer containing 110 μmol of d-[1-13C]glucose. For the analysis of l -proline metabolism, the cells were incubated in PBS, pH 7.3 (without NaHCO3), containing 20 μmol of l -[4-13C]proline and in the presence or absence of 100 μmol of unenriched d-glucose or 100 μmol of unenriched pyruvate. The d-glucose concentration in the medium was determined with the Glucose GOD-PAP kit. l -Proline concentration was determined with a calorimetric assay as described previously (36Bates L.S.

The integrity of the cells during the incubation was checked by microscopic observation. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1400 × g, the supernatant was lyophilized and redissolved in 485 μl of D2O, and 15 μl of pure dioxane was added as an external reference. 13C NMR spectra were collected at 125.77 MHz with a Bruker DPX500 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broadband probe head.

https://openalex.org/W2055812104,"Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) infiltrate human glioblastoma (GBM); are involved in tumor progression and correlate with tumor grade. Transient elimination of Tregs using CD25 depleting antibodies (PC61) has been found to mediate GBM regression in preclinical models of brain tumors. Clinical trials that combine Treg depletion with tumor vaccination are underway to determine whether transient Treg depletion can enhance anti-tumor immune responses and improve long term survival in cancer patients.Using a syngeneic intracrabial glioblastoma (GBM) mouse model we show that systemic depletion of Tregs 15 days after tumor implantation using PC61 resulted in a decrease in Tregs present in tumors, draining lymph nodes and spleen and improved long-term survival (50% of mice survived >150 days). No improvement in survival was observed when Tregs were depleted 24 days after tumor implantation, suggesting that tumor burden is an important factor for determining efficacy of Treg depletion in clinical trials. In a T cell dependent model of brain tumor regression elicited by intratumoral delivery of adenoviral vectors (Ad) expressing Fms-like Tyrosine Kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) and Herpes Simplex Type 1-Thymidine Kinase (TK) with ganciclovir (GCV), we demonstrate that administration of PC61 24 days after tumor implantation (7 days after treatment) inhibited T cell dependent tumor regression and long term survival. Further, depletion with PC61 completely inhibited clonal expansion of tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes in response to the treatment.Our data demonstrate for the first time, that although Treg depletion inhibits the progression/eliminates GBM tumors, its efficacy is dependent on tumor burden. We conclude that this approach will be useful in a setting of minimal residual disease. Further, we also demonstrate that Treg depletion, using PC61 in combination with immunotherapy, inhibits clonal expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells, suggesting that new, more specific targets to block Tregs will be necessary when used in combination with therapies that activate anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2070389231,"CD147, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), plays fundamental roles in intercellular interactions in numerous pathological and physiological processes. Importantly, our previous studies have demonstrated that HAb18G/CD147 is a novel hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated antigen, and HAb18G/CD147 stimulates adjacent fibroblasts and HCC cells to produce elevated levels of several matrix metalloproteinases, facilitating invasion and metastasis of HCC cells. In addition, HAb18G/CD147 has also been shown to be a novel universal cancer biomarker for diagnosis and prognostic assessment of a wide range of cancers. However, the structural basis underlying the multifunctional character of CD147 remains unresolved. We report here the crystal structure of the extracellular portion of HAb18G/CD147 at 2.8Å resolution. The structure comprises an N-terminal IgC2 domain and a C-terminal IgI domain, which are connected by a 5-residue flexible linker. This unique C2-I domain organization is distinct from those of other IgSF members. Four homophilic dimers exist in the crystal and adopt C2-C2 and C2-I dimerization rather than V-V dimerization commonly found in other IgSF members. This type of homophilic association thus presents a novel model for homophilic interaction between C2 domains of IgSF members. Moreover, the crystal structure of HAb18G/CD147 provides a good structural explanation for the established multifunction of CD147 mediated by homo/hetero-oligomerizations and should represent a general architecture of other CD147 family members."
https://openalex.org/W2093890995,"Although it is advantageous for hypoxic cells to inhibit protein synthesis and conserve energy, it is also important to translate mRNAs critical for adaptive responses to hypoxic stress. Because internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) have been postulated to mediate this preferential synthesis, we analyzed the 5 '-untranslated regions from a panel of stress-regulated mRNAs for m(7)GTP cap-independent translation and identified putative IRES elements in encephalomyocarditis virus, vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) 1alpha and 2alpha, glucose transporter-like protein 1, p57(Kip2), La, BiP, and triose phosphate isomerase transcripts. However, when capped and polyadenylated dicistronic RNAs were synthesized in vitro and transfected into cells, cellular IRES-mediated translation accounted for less than 1% that of the level of cap-dependent translation. Moreover, hypoxic stress failed to activate cap-independent synthesis, indicating that it is unlikely that this is the primary mechanism for the maintenance of the translation of these mRNAs under low O(2). Furthermore, although HIF-1alpha is frequently cited as an example of an mRNA that is preferentially translated, we demonstrate that under different levels and durations of hypoxic stress, changes in newly synthesized HIF-1alpha and beta-actin protein levels mirror alterations in corresponding mRNA abundance. In addition, our data suggest that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57(Kip2) and vascular endothelial growth factor mRNAs are selectively translated by an IRES-independent mechanism under hypoxic stress."

Despite recommendations that health care providers screen and counsel their HIV-positive patients for ongoing behavioral risks, it is unknown how to best provide ""prevention with positives"" in clinical settings. Positive Choice, an interactive, patient-tailored computer program, was developed in the United States to improve clinic-based assessment and counseling for risky behaviors.We conducted a parallel groups randomized controlled trial (December 2003-September 2006) at 5 San Francisco area outpatient HIV clinics. Eligible patients (HIV-positive English-speaking adults) completed an in-depth computerized risk assessment. Participants reporting substance use or sexual risks (n = 476) were randomized in stratified blocks. The intervention group received tailored risk-reduction counseling from a ""Video Doctor"" via laptop computer and a printed Educational Worksheet; providers received a Cueing Sheet on reported risks. Compared with control, fewer intervention participants reported continuing illicit drug use (RR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.689, 0.957, p = 0.014 at 3 months; and RR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.540, 0.785, p<0.001 at 6 months) and unprotected sex (RR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.773, 0.993, p = 0.039 at 3 months; and RR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.686, 0.941, p = 0.007 at 6 months). Intervention participants reported fewer mean days of ongoing illicit drug use (-4.0 days vs. -1.3 days, p = 0.346, at 3 months; and -4.7 days vs. -0.7 days, p = 0.130, at 6 months) than did controls, and had fewer casual sex partners at (-2.3 vs. -1.4, p = 0.461, at 3 months; and -2.7 vs. -0.6, p = 0.042, at 6 months).The Positive Choice intervention achieved significant cessation of illicit drug use and unprotected sex at the group-level, and modest individual-level reductions in days of ongoing drug use and number of casual sex partners compared with the control group. Positive Choice, including Video Doctor counseling, is an efficacious and appropriate adjunct to risk-reduction efforts in outpatient settings, and holds promise as a public health HIV intervention.Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00447707."
https://openalex.org/W1976119378,"Wnt proteins comprise a large class of secreted signaling molecules with key roles during embryonic development and throughout adult life. Recently, much effort has been focused on understanding the factors that regulate Wnt signal production. For example, Porcupine and Wntless/Evi/Sprinter have been identified as being required in Wnt-producing cells for the processing and secretion of many Wnt proteins. Interestingly, in this study we find that WntD, a recently characterized Drosophila Wnt family member, does not require Porcupine or Wntless/Evi/Sprinter for its secretion or signaling activity. Because Porcupine is involved in post-translational lipid modification of Wnt proteins, we used a novel labeling method and mass spectrometry to ask whether WntD undergoes lipid modification and found that it does not. Although lipid modification is also hypothesized to be required for Wnt secretion, we find that WntD is secreted very efficiently. WntD secretion does, however, maintain a requirement for the secretory pathway component Rab1. Our results show that not all Wnt family members require lipid modification, Porcupine, or Wntless/Evi/Sprinter for secretion and suggest that different modes of secretion may exist for different Wnt proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1979534693,"Background Prion-based diseases are incurable transmissible neurodegenerative disorders affecting animals and humans. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report the discovery of the in vivo antiprion activity of Guanabenz (GA), an agonist of α2-adrenergic receptors routinely used in human medicine as an antihypertensive drug. We isolated GA in a screen for drugs active in vivo against two different yeast prions using a previously described yeast-based two steps assay. GA was then shown to promote ovine PrPSc clearance in a cell-based assay. These effects are very specific as evidenced by the lack of activity of some GA analogues that we generated. GA antiprion activity does not involve its agonist activity on α2-adrenergic receptors as other chemically close anti-hypertensive agents possessing related mechanism of action were found inactive against prions. Finally, GA showed activity in a transgenic mouse-based in vivo assay for ovine prion propagation, prolonging slightly but significantly the survival of treated animals. Conclusion/Significance GA thus adds to the short list of compounds active in vivo in animal models for the treatment of prion-based diseases. Because it has been administrated for many years to treat hypertension on a daily basis, without major side-effects, our results suggest that it could be evaluated in human as a potential treatment for prion-based diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1589994366,"Protein kinase Ciota (PKCiota) drives transformed growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through the Rho family GTPase Rac1. We show here that PKCiota activates Rac1 in NSCLC cells by formation of a PKCiota-Par6alpha complex that drives anchorage-independent growth and invasion through activation of matrix metalloproteinase-10 (MMP-10) expression. RNAi-mediated knockdown of PKCiota, Par6alpha or Rac1 expression inhibits NSCLC transformation and MMP-10 expression in vitro. Expression of wild-type Par6alpha in Par6alpha-deficient cells restores transformation and MMP-10 expression, whereas expression of Par6alpha mutants that either cannot bind PKCiota (Par6alpha-K19A) or couple to Rac1 (Par6alpha-DeltaCRIB) do not. Knockdown of MMP-10 expression blocks anchorage-independent growth and invasion of NSCLC cells and addition of catalytically active MMP-10 to PKCiota- or Par6alpha-deficient cells restores anchorage-independent growth and invasion. Dominant-negative PKCiota inhibits tumorigenicity and MMP-10 expression in subcutaneous NSCLC tumors. MMP-10 and PKCiota are coordinately overexpressed in primary NSCLC tumors, and tumor MMP-10 expression predicts poor survival in NSCLC patients. Our data define a PKCiota-Par6alpha-Rac1 signaling axis that drives anchorage-independent growth and invasion of NSCLC cells through induction of MMP-10 expression."
https://openalex.org/W2061517634,"Implementation of yellow fever vaccination is currently hampered by limited supply of vaccine. An alternative route of administration with reduced amounts of vaccine but without loss of vaccine efficacy would boost vaccination programmes.A randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial was conducted in a Dutch university center between August 2005 and February 2007. A total of 155 primary vaccinated and 20 previously vaccinated volunteers participated. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1ratio1 ratio to receive intradermal (i.d.) vaccination with live attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine at a reduced dose (1/5(th); 0.1 mL) or the conventional subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination (0.5 mL). Antibody neutralization titers were determined at 2, 4 and 8 weeks and 1 year after vaccination by counting the reduction in virus-induced plaques in the presence of serial serum dilutions. Adverse events were documented in a 3-week dairy. Viraemia was measured 5 days after vaccination. From 2 weeks up to one year after vaccination, the maximum serum-dilution at which 80% of the virus plaques were neutralized, which indicates protection against yellow fever, did not differ between those given a reduced i.d. dose or standard s.c. dose of vaccine. In all cases the WHO standard of seroprotection (i.e. 80% virus neutralization) was reached (in 77/77 and 78/78, respectively). Similar results were found in the previously vaccinated individuals. Viraemia was detected in half of the primary vaccinated participants, which was not predictive of serological response. In revaccinees no viraemia was detected.Intradermal administration of one fifth of the amount of yellow fever vaccine administered subcutaneously results in protective seroimmunity in all volunteers. Albeit this vaccination route should enable vaccination of five-times as many individuals at risk for disease, these results should now be confirmed in field studies in areas with potential yellow fever virus transmission to change vaccination policy.Nederlands Trial Register ISRCTN46326316."
https://openalex.org/W1989590372,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes via regulating expression of their target genes at the mRNA level. A number of computational approaches regarding miRNAs have been proposed, but most of them focus on miRNA gene finding or target predictions. Little computational work has been done to investigate the effective regulation of miRNAs. Methodology/Principal Findings We propose a method to infer the effective regulatory activities of miRNAs by integrating microarray expression data with miRNA target predictions. The method is based on the idea that regulatory activity changes of miRNAs could be reflected by the expression changes of their target transcripts measured by microarray. To validate this method, we apply it to the microarray data sets that measure gene expression changes in cell lines after transfection or inhibition of several specific miRNAs. The results indicate that our method can detect activity enhancement of the transfected miRNAs as well as activity reduction of the inhibited miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, we show that our inference is robust with respect to false positives of target prediction. Conclusions/Significance A huge amount of gene expression data sets are available in the literature, but miRNA regulation underlying these data sets is largely unknown. The method is easy to be implemented and can be used to investigate the miRNA effective regulation underlying the expression change profiles obtained from microarray experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1976252707,"Antigenic variation is a subtle process of fundamental importance to the survival of a microbial pathogen. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, PfEMP1 is the major variable antigen and adhesin expressed at the surface of the infected erythrocyte, which is encoded for by members of a family of 60 var-genes. Peri-nuclear repositioning and epigenetic mechanisms control their mono-allelic expression. The switching of PfEMP1 depends in part on variable transition rates and short-lived immune responses to shared minor epitopes. Here we show var-genes to switch to a common gene that is highly transcribed, but sparsely translated into PfEMP1 and not expressed at the erythrocyte surface. Highly clonal and adhesive P. falciparum, which expressed distinct var-genes and the corresponding PfEMP1s at onset, were propagated without enrichment or panning. The parasites successively and spontaneously switched to transcribe a shared var-gene (var2csa) matched by the loss of PfEMP1 surface expression and host cell-binding. The var2csa gene repositioned in the peri-nuclear area upon activation, away from the telomeric clusters and heterochromatin to transcribe spliced, full-length RNA. Despite abundant transcripts, the level of intracellular PfEMP1 was low suggesting post-transcriptional mechanisms to partake in protein expression. In vivo, off-switching and translational repression may constitute one pathway, among others, coordinating PfEMP1 expression."

Recent studies indicate that secretion of the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex is an active process involving a specialized transport system formed from the products of several flanking genes, including the putative membrane ATPases Rv3870 and Rv3871 and the predicted transmembrane protein Rv3877 (21Stanley S.A.

Secretion of CFP-10 and ESAT-6 also appears to depend upon proteins encoded by the distant Rv3613c-Rv3616c operon (25Fortune S.M. Jaeger A. Sarracino D.A. Chase M.R. Sassetti C.M. Sherman D.R.

Analagous gene clusters coding for homologues of essential elements of the CFP-10·ESAT-6 secretory complex are also found surrounding other pairs of CFP-10/ESAT-6 family genes, including Rv0287/Rv0288 (EsxG/EsxH), Rv1792/Rv1793 (EsxM/EsxN) and Rv3890c/Rv3891c (EsxC/EsxD) (6Gey van Pittius N.

Interestingly, the genome of M. leprae, which probably contains the minimal gene set required for a pathogenic mycobacterium (4Cole S.T. Eiglmeier K. Parkhill J. James K.D. Thomson N.R. Wheeler P.R.

Despite the clear importance of the CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins in mycobacterial virulence and pathogenesis, we have relatively little understanding of their precise functions and molecular mechanisms of action. The structural and surface features of the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex, as well as the ability to specifically bind to the surface of monocyte and macrophage cells, strongly suggests a key role in pathogen to host cell signaling (27Renshaw P.S. Lightbody K.L. Veverka V. Muskett F.W. Kelly G. Frenkiel T.A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Burke B. Norman J. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether complexes formed by other CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins will have similar roles, or whether they mediate a diverse range of functions. For example, recent studies have shown that expression of the Rv0287/Rv0288 gene cluster (from Rv0282 to Rv0292) is induced under conditions of iron and zinc starvation in vitro, suggesting a possible role in the scavenging or uptake of iron and zinc (28Rodriguez G.M.

Regulation of Rv0287/Rv0288 by IdeR (iron-dependent regulator protein) and ZurB (zinc uptake regulator protein) may also suggest that members of the CFP-10/ESAT-6 protein family are expressed under different physiological conditions, or at various stages throughout infection. Further detailed investigation of the structural and functional features of the complexes formed by CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins is clearly a priority, including the need to understand the features governing the specificity of complex formation between CFP-10-related proteins and their ESAT-6 partners, as well as to investigate their stability under conditions found in vivo. In this article we report the characterization of the structural properties and features of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex, and compare these with the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex. We demonstrate that both complexes remain stable under conditions comparable with those expected in vivo, further emphasizing that the functional forms of CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins are highly likely to be as complexes formed between CFP-10 and ESAT-6 related genome partners. In addition, combined analysis of the sequence conservation between CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins and the structure determined for the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex has allowed the identification of key residues involved in complex stability and specificity for CFP-10/ESAT-6 family proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—CFP-10 and ESAT-6 were cloned, expressed, and purified as described by Renshaw et al. (7Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The genes encoding Rv0287 and Rv0288 were cloned into pET28a-based Escherichia coli expression vectors and were expressed as full-length proteins with an N-terminal His tag (14Lightbody K.L. Renshaw P.S. Collins M.L. Wright R.L. Hunt D.M. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Buxton R.S. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 238: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar). Both Rv0287 and Rv0288 were purified from inclusion bodies, which were initially washed four times in 50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer at pH 8.0 and then resolubilized in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) 3The abbreviation used is: GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride. buffer at pH 7.4 (1 mm EDTA and 100 μm 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The two proteins were refolded by dialysis against 25 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm imidazole buffer at pH 7.4 (100 μm 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride) and then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. Rv0287 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 also required a final gel filtration chromatography step on a 120-ml Superdex 75 16/60 prepacked column (GE Healthcare) to remove the remaining contaminants. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of Rv0287, Rv0288, and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex were acquired on a PerkinElmer LS50B luminescence spectrometer at a scan rate of 150 nm/min. The proteins were excited at 280 nm and fluorescence emission was monitored between 300 and 450 nm. The final spectra were corrected for the buffer background and were the result of a smoothed average of 10 accumulations. The individual proteins and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex were analyzed at 0.5 to 3.0 μm in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.5. Complex formation between Rv0287 and Rv0288 was investigated by monitoring the shift in the maximum intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of Rv0288 at increasing molar ratios of Rv0287 to Rv0288 (0:1 to 2.25:1). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure of the individual Rv0287 and Rv0288 proteins and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. All CD spectra were obtained from protein samples dissolved in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.5 with protein concentrations of 5.0 to 15.0 μm. Spectra were recorded from 180 to 250 nm at a scan speed of 20 nm/min and a response time of 1 s, with each spectrum representing the sum of 10 accumulations. All spectra were acquired at 25 °C in a 1-mm path length cell. Spectra were corrected for the buffer and converted to molar CD per residue. The CD data were analyzed using the CD Pro package to provide estimates of the secondary structure content (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—15N/1H HSQC spectra were acquired from 0.35-ml samples of ∼0.8 mm Rv0287·Rv0288 complex in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride, 100 μm 4-(aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% sodium azide buffer at pH 6.5. The NMR spectra were recorded from complexes containing either uniformly 15N-labeled Rv0287 and unlabeled Rv0288, or vice versa, to reduce spectral overlap. The NMR experiments were collected at 35 °C on a 800 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance (15N/13C/1H) cryoprobe and processed using the Topspin package (Bruker). Chemical Denaturation—The conformational stability of Rv0288 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex were assessed by determining their resistance to chemical denaturation by GdnHCl. This was monitored by following the shift in the wavelength of maximum intrinsic fluorescence as the concentration of GdnHCl was increased from 0 to 3 m. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min prior to fluorescence analysis, as described above. Rv0288 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex were analyzed at 0.5 μm in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.5. Temperature Denaturation—The stability of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex to temperature denaturation was determined by following changes in the CD spectra. The changes in the intensity of the maximum negative peak at 208 nm were recorded as a function of increasing temperature (from 5 to 85 °C), with the temperature rising incrementally at 1 °C/min. All CD spectra were obtained from protein samples at ∼15.0 μm in 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.5. The CD spectra were collected in a 1-mm path length cell and corrected for the buffer background and converted to molar CD per residue. Data for the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex were collected as described by Renshaw et al. (7Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). pH Stability—The effect of pH on the stability of both Rv0287·Rv0288 and CFP-10·ESAT-6 complexes was investigated by determining GdnHCl denaturation curves at pH 6.5, 5.5, and 4.5, as described above. The complexes were analyzed at 0.5 μm in either 25 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm sodium chloride at pH 6.5 or 25 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm sodium chloride at pH 5.5 and 4.5. Sequence Alignments—CFP-10 and ESAT-6 family proteins were aligned using ClustalW with a Gonnet scoring matrix, a gap opening penalty of 10, and a gap extension penalty of 0.2 (31Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4055) Google Scholar). Due to very high levels of sequence similarity between some members of the CFP-10/ESAT-6 protein family, Rv0287 and Rv0288 were chosen to represent both Rv0287/Rv0288 (esxG/esxH) and Rv3019c and Rv3020c (esxR/esxS). Similarly, Rv2346c (esxO) and Rv2347c (esxP) were selected to represent five pairs of highly sequence-related proteins (MTINY/QILSS families), including Rv1037c/Rv1038c (esxI/esxJ), Rv1197/Rv1198 (esxK/esxL), Rv1792/Rv1793 (esxM/esxN), and Rv3619c/Rv3620c (esxV/esxW). Characterization of Complex Formation between Rv0287 and Rv0288—We have previously reported yeast two-hybrid studies showing that Rv0287 and Rv0288, like CFP-10 and ESAT-6, interact with each other to form a tight complex (14Lightbody K.L. Renshaw P.S. Collins M.L. Wright R.L. Hunt D.M. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Buxton R.S. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 238: 255-262PubMed Google Scholar). We have now used changes in the wavelength of maximum intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (λmax) for Rv0288 induced by Rv0287 binding to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of this interaction (Fig. 1). The λmax of the individual Rv0288 protein is 349 nm, indicating that the four tryptophan residues (Trp43, Trp54, Trp58, and Trp94) are predominantly exposed to the solvent. Rv0287 does not contain any tryptophan residues hence, the fluorescence spectra only directly monitor changes in Rv0288. A shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence is observed as the ratio of Rv0287 to Rv0288 is increased from 0:1 to 1:1, but further addition of Rv0287 has no significant effect, which strongly suggests the formation of a 1:1 complex. The formation of a heterodimer was confirmed by the line widths observed in 15N/1H HSQC spectra of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex, and by the complexes behavior on gel filtration chromatography. The λmax of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex (343 nm) is significantly blue shifted compared with Rv0288 alone (349 nm), suggesting that at least one of the four tryptophan residues from Rv0288 becomes less solvent exposed on formation of the complex. Based on the structure of the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex (27Renshaw P.S. Lightbody K.L. Veverka V. Muskett F.W. Kelly G. Frenkiel T.A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Burke B. Norman J. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), it is likely that the highly conserved Trp43 residue, which is located in the tight turn between the two helices of ESAT-6, will be largely buried within the hydrophobic core of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex. Similarly, both Trp54 and Trp58 are also expected to form part of the hydrophobic core of the complex, located at the interface between Rv0287 and Rv0288. In contrast, the C-terminal Trp94 is likely to be fully exposed to the solvent. Thus, the blue shift in tryptophan fluorescence on complex formation probably reflects Trp43, Trp54, and Trp58 occupying a less polar environment within the protein complex compared with the individual Rv0288 protein. The fluorescence measurements were carried out at a Rv0288 concentration of 0.5 μm and the lack of any significant shift in λmax after the addition of an equimolar amount of Rv0287 indicates not only that the two proteins form a 1:1 complex, but also that the vast majority (>90%) of the two proteins are complexed at this concentration. This suggests a tight interaction between the two proteins with an estimated dissociation constant (Kd) for the complex of 5 nm or lower. The secondary structure of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex and the individual proteins were determined by far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The spectra obtained for the isolated Rv0287 protein (Fig. 2) are typical of an unstructured, random coil polypeptide and analysis with CDPro (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) indicates only 1% α-helical and 11% β-sheet structure. In contrast, the spectra for Rv0288 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex (Fig. 2) are typical of proteins with significant helical structure, which are characterized by intense negative CD peaks at ∼208 and 221 nm (32Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Rv0288 and the complex were estimated by CDPro (30Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 100-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) to contain 24% α-helix (18% β-sheet and 58% unstructured) and 50% α-helix (23% β-sheet and 27% unstructured), respectively. However, the CD spectra were acquired from Rv0287 and Rv0288, which both contain an extra 20 residues at the N terminus from the His6 tag and linker. These residues are expected to be unstructured, which clearly suggests that the helical content of the regions corresponding to Rv0288 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex are significantly higher. If the secondary structures are corrected for the presence of an unstructured N-terminal His tag, the helical content is about 30% for Rv0288 and 60% for the complex. The helical content of the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex is similar to that reported for the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex (70%) (7Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21598-21603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which together with significant sequence similarity suggests that both complexes form similar structures (27Renshaw P.S. Lightbody K.L. Veverka V. Muskett F.W. Kelly G. Frenkiel T.A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Burke B. Norman J. Williamson R.A. Carr M.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2491-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Characterization of the Stability of the Rv0287·Rv0288 Complex and Individual Proteins—The CD studies described above clearly show that the isolated Rv0287 exists as an unfolded random coil polypeptide, however, the stability of Rv0288 and the Rv0287·Rv0288 complex were assessed by determining their resistance to chemical and heat-induced denaturation, which were monitored by changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and CD spectra. The chemical (Fig. 3) and temperature (data not shown) denaturation curves obtained for Rv0288 both show a gradual, non-cooperative unfolding of the protein, which indicates that Rv0288 contains no stable tertiary structure and the spectral changes seen probably reflect the unfolding of isolated helical regions. The presence of significant helical structure but no apparent resistance to denaturation implies that Rv0288 exists as a molten globule-type structure. Interestingly, ESAT-6 in the absence of its binding partner CFP-10 also exists in a molten globule state (7Renshaw P.S. Panagiotidou P. Whelan A. Gordon S.V. Hewinson R.G. Williamson R.A.

FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1445-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Examination of the structure of the CFP-10·ESAT-6 complex reveals a mini hydrophobic core within the region of ESAT-6 forming the tight turn between the pair of anti-parallel helices, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The structure of this region of ESAT-6 is clearly stabilized by favorable van der Waals interactions between the side chains of Leu36, Trp43, Tyr51, Val54, and Gln55. The equivalent region of CFP-10 in the complex is not stabilized by a comparable network of interactions, which strongly suggests that the formation of this mini hydrophobic core is necessary to induce partial folding of ESAT-6, and probably explains why isolated ESAT-6 alone forms a molten globule, whereas CFP-10 is a random coil polypeptide. The importance of this region of ESAT-6 in complex formation has been highlighted by several recent studies (34Brodin P. de Jonge M.I. Majlessi L. Leclerc C. Nilges M. Cole S.T. Brosch R. J. Biol.

This strengthens the proposal tha"
https://openalex.org/W1969469738,"Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates lymphocyte proliferation and peripheral tolerance. IL-2 activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways and modulates expression of target genes. Systematic analysis of IL-2 target genes has revealed regulation of potential feedback inhibitors of IL-2 signaling, including several suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family members as well as MAPK pathway-regulating dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs). Here we have evaluated the in vivo actions of DUSP5, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-specific phosphatase, by generating transgenic mice overexpressing DUSP5 within the lymphoid compartment. We show that transgenic DUSP5 expression results in a block in thymocyte development at the double positive stage. We also demonstrate that DUSP5-expressing mature T cells exhibit decreased IL-2-dependent proliferation and defective IL-2-mediated induction of genes. Finally, DUSP5 transgenic mice develop autoimmune symptoms, suggesting a role for the MAPK pathway in the regulation of tolerance. Thus, proper regulation of DUSP5 activity is critical for normal immune system development, IL-2 actions, and tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2002164468,"As well as nutritional rewards, some plants also reward ectothermic pollinators with warmth. Bumble bees have some control over their temperature, but have been shown to forage at warmer flowers when given a choice, suggesting that there is some advantage to them of foraging at warm flowers (such as reducing the energy required to raise their body to flight temperature before leaving the flower). We describe a model that considers how a heat reward affects the foraging behaviour in a thermogenic central-place forager (such as a bumble bee). We show that although the pollinator should spend a longer time on individual flowers if they are warm, the increase in total visit time is likely to be small. The pollinator's net rate of energy gain will be increased by landing on warmer flowers. Therefore, if a plant provides a heat reward, it could reduce the amount of nectar it produces, whilst still providing its pollinator with the same net rate of gain. We suggest how heat rewards may link with plant life history strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2061494173,"In this study, we addressed the functional consequences of the human cardiac troponin I (hcTnI) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy R145G mutation in transgenic mice. Simultaneous measurements of ATPase activity and force in skinned papillary fibers from hcTnI R145G transgenic mice (Tg-R145G) versus hcTnI wild type transgenic mice (Tg-WT) showed a significant decrease in the maximal Ca(2+)-activated force without changes in the maximal ATPase activity and an increase in the Ca(2+) sensitivity of both ATPase and force development. No difference in the cross-bridge turnover rate was observed at the same level of cross-bridge attachment (activation state), showing that changes in Ca(2+) sensitivity were not due to changes in cross-bridge kinetics. Energy cost calculations demonstrated higher energy consumption in Tg-R145G fibers compared with Tg-WT fibers. The addition of 3 mm 2,3-butanedione monoxime at pCa 9.0 showed that there was approximately 2-4% of force generating cross-bridges attached in Tg-R145G fibers compared with less than 1.0% in Tg-WT fibers, suggesting that the mutation impairs the ability of the cardiac troponin complex to fully inhibit cross-bridge attachment under relaxing conditions. Prolonged force and intracellular [Ca(2+)] transients in electrically stimulated intact papillary muscles were observed in Tg-R145G compared with Tg-WT. These results suggest that the phenotype of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most likely caused by the compensatory mechanisms in the cardiovascular system that are activated by 1) higher energy cost in the heart resulting from a significant decrease in average force per cross-bridge, 2) slowed relaxation (diastolic dysfunction) caused by prolonged [Ca(2+)] and force transients, and 3) an inability of the cardiac TnI to completely inhibit activation in the absence of Ca(2+) in Tg-R145G mice."
https://openalex.org/W2092796690,"Many animals in the tropics of Africa, Asia and South America regularly visit so-called salt or mineral licks to consume clay or drink clay-saturated water. Whether this behavior is used to supplement diets with locally limited nutrients or to buffer the effects of toxic secondary plant compounds remains unclear. In the Amazonian rainforest, pregnant and lactating bats are frequently observed and captured at mineral licks. We measured the nitrogen isotope ratio in wing tissue of omnivorous short-tailed fruit bats, Carollia perspicillata, and in an obligate fruit-eating bat, Artibeus obscurus, captured at mineral licks and at control sites in the rainforest. Carollia perspicillata with a plant-dominated diet were more often captured at mineral licks than individuals with an insect-dominated diet, although insects were more mineral depleted than fruits. In contrast, nitrogen isotope ratios of A. obscurus did not differ between individuals captured at mineral lick versus control sites. We conclude that pregnant and lactating fruit-eating bats do not visit mineral licks principally for minerals, but instead to buffer the effects of secondary plant compounds that they ingest in large quantities during periods of high energy demand. These findings have potential implications for the role of mineral licks for mammals in general, including humans."
https://openalex.org/W2007374498,"Plasmodium falciparum malaria episodes may vary considerably in their severity and clinical manifestations. There is good evidence that host genetic factors contribute to this variability. To date, most genetic studies aiming at the identification of these genes have used a case/control study design for severe malaria, exploring specific candidate genes. Here, we performed a family-based genetic study of falciparum malaria related phenotypes in two independent longitudinal survey cohorts, as a first step towards the identification of genes and mechanisms involved in the outcome of infection. We studied two Senegalese villages, Dielmo and Ndiop that differ in ethnicity, malaria transmission and endemicity. We performed genome-scan linkage analysis of several malaria-related phenotypes both during clinical attacks and asymptomatic infection. We show evidence for a strong genetic contribution to both the number of clinical falciparum malaria attacks and the asymptomatic parasite density. The asymptomatic parasite density showed linkage to chromosome 5q31 (LOD = 2.26, empirical p = 0.0014, Dielmo), confirming previous findings in other studies. Suggestive linkage values were also obtained at three additional chromosome regions: the number of clinical malaria attacks on chromosome 5p15 (LOD = 2.57, empirical p = 0.001, Dielmo) and 13q13 (LOD = 2.37, empirical p = 0.0014 Dielmo), and the maximum parasite density during asymptomatic infection on chromosome 12q21 (LOD = 3.1, empirical p<10(-4), Ndiop). While regions of linkage show little overlap with genes known to be involved in severe malaria, the four regions appear to overlap with regions linked to asthma or atopy related traits, suggesting that common immune related pathways may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W1964140959,"The Damaged DNA binding protein 2 (DDB2), is involved in nucleotide excision repair as well as in other biological processes in normal cells, including transcription and cell cycle regulation. Loss of DDB2 function may be related to tumor susceptibility. However, hypothesis of this study was that DDB2 could play a role in breast cancer cell growth, resulting in its well known interaction with the proliferative marker E2F1 in breast neoplasia. DDB2 gene was overexpressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF-7 and T47D), but not in ER-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB231 and SKBR3) or normal mammary epithelial cell lines. In addition, DDB2 expression was significantly (3.0-fold) higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative tumor samples (P = 0.0208) from 16 patients with breast carcinoma. Knockdown of DDB2 by small interfering RNA in MCF-7 cells caused a decrease in cancer cell growth and colony formation. Inversely, introduction of the DDB2 gene into MDA-MB231 cells stimulated growth and colony formation. Cell cycle distribution and 5 Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation by flow cytometry analysis showed that the growth-inhibiting effect of DDB2 knockdown was the consequence of a delayed G1/S transition and a slowed progression through the S phase of MCF-7 cells. These results were supported by a strong decrease in the expression of S phase markers (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen, cyclin E and dihydrofolate reductase). These findings demonstrate for the first time that DDB2 can play a role as oncogene and may become a promising candidate as a predictive marker in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1985048539,"Background WHO-defined pneumonias, treated with antibiotics, are responsible for a significant proportion of childhood morbidity and mortality in the developing countries. Since substantial proportion pneumonias have a viral etiology, where children are more likely to present with wheeze, there is a concern that currently antibiotics are being over-prescribed for it. Hence the current trial was conducted with the objective to show the therapeutic equivalence of two treatments (placebo and amoxycillin) for children presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze, who have persistent fast breathing after nebulisation with salbutamol, and have normal chest radiograph. Methodology This multi-centric, randomised placebo controlled double blind clinical trial intended to investigate equivalent efficacy of placebo and amoxicillin and was conducted in ambulatory care settings in eight government hospitals in India. Participants were children aged 2–59 months of age, who received either oral amoxycillin (31–54 mg/Kg/day, in three divided doses for three days) or placebo, and standard bronchodilator therapy. Primary outcome was clinical failure on or before day- 4. Principal Findings We randomized 836 cases in placebo and 835 in amoxycillin group. Clinical failures occurred in 201 (24.0%) on placebo and 166 (19.9%) on amoxycillin (risk difference 4.2% in favour of antibiotic, 95% CI: 0.2 to 8.1). Adherence for both placebo and amoxycillin was >96% and 98.9% subjects were followed up on day- 4. Clinical failure was associated with (i) placebo treatment (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01 to1.62), (ii) excess respiratory rate of >10 breaths per minute (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.92), (iii) vomiting at enrolment (adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.96), (iv) history of use of broncho-dilators (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.24) and (v) non-adherence (adjusted OR = 8.06, 95% CI: 4.36, 14.92). Conclusions Treating children with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze with a placebo is not equivalent to treatment with oral amoxycillin. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00407394"
https://openalex.org/W2037049436,"Background The defensive effect of endogenous trypsin proteinase inhibitors (NaTPIs) on the herbivore Manduca sexta was demonstrated by genetically altering NaTPI production in M. sexta's host plant, Nicotiana attenuata. To understand how this defense works, we studied the effects of NaTPI on M. sexta gut proteinase activity levels in different larval instars of caterpillars feeding freely on untransformed and transformed plants. Methodology/ Principal Findings Second and third instars larvae that fed on NaTPI-producing (WT) genotypes were lighter and had less gut proteinase activity compared to those that fed on genotypes with either little or no NaTPI activity. Unexpectedly, NaTPI activity in vitro assays not only inhibited the trypsin sensitive fraction of gut proteinase activity but also halved the NaTPI-insensitive fraction in third-instar larvae. Unable to degrade NaTPI, larvae apparently lacked the means to adapt to NaTPI in their diet. However, caterpillars recovered at least part of their gut proteinase activity when they were transferred from NaTPI-producing host plants to NaTPI-free host plants. In addition extracts of basal leaves inhibited more gut proteinase activity than did extracts of middle stem leaves with the same protein content. Conclusions/ Significance Although larvae can minimize the effects of high NaTPI levels by feeding on leaves with high protein and low NaTPI activity, the host plant's endogenous NaTPIs remain an effective defense against M. sexta, inhibiting gut proteinase and affecting larval performance."
https://openalex.org/W2160739939,"The spectacular marine-like diversity of the endemic fauna of Lake Tanganyika, the oldest of the African Great Lakes, led early researchers to suggest that the lake must have once been connected to the ocean. Recent geophysical reconstructions clearly indicate that Lake Tanganyika formed by rifting in the African subcontinent and was never directly linked to the sea. Although the Lake has a high proportion of specialized endemics, the absence of close relatives outside Tanganyika has complicated phylogeographic reconstructions of the timing of lake colonization and intralacustrine diversification. The freshwater herring of Lake Tanganyika are members of a large group of pellonuline herring found in western and southern Africa, offering one of the best opportunities to trace the evolutionary history of members of Tanganyika's biota. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that herring colonized West Africa 25–50MYA, at the end of a major marine incursion in the region. Pellonuline herring subsequently experienced an evolutionary radiation in West Africa, spreading across the continent and reaching East Africa's Lake Tanganyika during its early formation. While Lake Tanganyika has never been directly connected with the sea, the endemic freshwater herring of the lake are the descendents of an ancient marine incursion, a scenario which may also explain the origin of other Tanganyikan endemics."
https://openalex.org/W2054880372,"Background Targeted preventive chemotherapy of individuals with progressive subclinical (incipient) disease before it becomes contagious would break the chain of tuberculosis transmission in high endemic regions. We have studied the ability of a skin test response to ESAT-6 and CFP10 (E6/C10) to predict later development of tuberculosis disease in the guinea pig model. Methods and Findings Guinea pigs, either vaccinated with BCG or unvaccinated, were infected with a low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the aerosol route and the development of delayed type hypersensitivity responses to E6/C10 and to purified protein derivative (PPD) were followed until the onset of clinical disease. We demonstrated a negative correlation between the size of the skin test response and the time to the onset of clinical disease; a large E6/C10 skin test response correlated to a shorter survival time post skin testing, while a small E6/C10 skin test reaction correlated with a longer survival time (r = −0.6 and P<0.0001). No correlation was found using PPD. Conclusions Our data suggest that it may be possible to develop a prognostic skin test based on E6/C10 that will allow the identification of individuals with incipient disease, who have the highest risk of developing active tuberculosis in the near future."

Polysaccharide lyases (EC 4.2.2.x) are polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds of C5 uronic acid polymers. They play a central role in the recycling of plant material and are potent virulence factors of plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi. In contrast to the 111 sequence-derived families of glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases have been grouped into only 18 families in the CAZy data base (1Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J.

These enzymes cleave polymeric α-1,4-linked galacturonic acid (GalA) within the pectate component of the cell wall by β-elimination mechanism, leaving an unsaturated C4-C5 bond at the newly formed non-reducing end. The activity is maximal in the pH range 8.5-10.5 and is metal ion-dependent; Ca2+ is the general cofactor except for the members of the family PL-2, which depend on Co2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ (2Shevchik V.E.

Interestingly, the structures of inactive mutants from family 1 PelC and family 10 Pel10Acm in complex with oligogalacturonate and Ca2+ show a similar pattern of enzyme-substrate interactions in their active sites (4Scavetta R.D.

Such local structural equivalence suggests a common β-elimination mechanism among pectate lyases regardless of the topology of the protein. The catalytic reaction is initiated by an essential basic amino acid that abstracts the proton from the carbon C5. This residue appears to be an arginine in families PL-1 (7Yoder M.D. Lietzke S.E.

Whether a lysine or an arginine is the catalytic base for family PL-3 remains to be determined (11Akita M. Suzuki A. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Yamane T. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1786-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The enterobacterium E. chrysanthemi is a causative agent of soft rot disease in a wide variety of plants. Among a set of pectin-depolymerizing enzymes produced by Erwinia, pectate lyases are the major pectinases and play a key role in plant tissue maceration. The pectate lyase PelI belongs to family PL-3 and is the only known example from the E. chrysanthemi pectinases that comprises two functional modules, termed the N-terminal domain (residues 20-116) and the catalytic domain (residues 117-344) (6Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The close homologue Pel-3 from Erwinia carotovora (19Liu Y. Chatterjee A. Chatterjee A.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2545-2552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has a similar N-terminal extension, suggesting analogous protein architecture. PelI possesses a 19-residue signal peptide that is cleaved during export by the Sec system, following which the protein is secreted into the external medium by the type 2 secretion system (20Login F.H. Shevchik V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33152-33162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The two structural modules are separated in planta by E. chrysanthemi proteases (6Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The resulting catalytic domain (residues 117-344) possesses similar enzymatic properties in vitro to the full-length protein. However, in contrast to the full-length PelI, it elicits a necrotic reaction associated with an active defense by plants. This hypersensitive response is characteristic of a set of effector proteins secreted by many plant pathogenic bacteria by the type 3 secretion systems (21Buttner D. Bonas U. Curr. Opin. Plant. Biol. 2003; 6: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of PelI shows a sequence identity of 26% with the unique structural representative of the family PL-3, the alkaline pectate lyase Pel-15 of Bacillus sp. strain KSM-P15 (11Akita M. Suzuki A. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Yamane T. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1786-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This protein exhibits the classical superhelical fold, and its putative active site is located in a conserved cleft that stretches along the external core of the superhelix. Here, we present the crystallographic structures of full-length PelI and that of the single catalytic domain termed PelIcata in order to visualize the rearrangements that likely occur in planta after maturation. Furthermore, the associated structure of PelI in complex with a polygalacturonate fragment (a tetragalacturonate GalA4) provides new insight into the catalytical mechanism. Protein Purification—PelI was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) cells carrying a high expression plasmid with the pelI gene and purified to homogeneity as described before (22Castang S. Shevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Legrand P. Haser R. Gouet P. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The module PelIcata was obtained by treatment of pure full-length PelI with the E. chrysanthemi protease PrtC (6Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PelIcata was then separated from the N-terminal domain by chromatography on Protein-Pak CM 8HR (Waters) column equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 5.0 buffer. The protein was eluted with a 0-0.5 m NaCl linear gradient in the same buffer and then concentrated to 15 mg/ml in a Centricon 10 (Amicon) in 10 mm Tris-HCl with 0.1 mm CaCl2. Construction of Mutant Proteins and Enzyme Assay—Single amino acid mutations were introduced in the PelI sequence by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The primers used are PelIK224R (5′-ggcggcaaaccggacagagtgctgcagcacaattcc-3′), PelIK249R (5′-ctgaccggtgaacacgggagattgtggcgttcctgcgg-3′), PelIR252K (5′-ggtgaacacgggaaattgtggaagtcctgcggcgactgctcc-3′), and the corresponding reverse complementary primers (mutated bases are in bold). The nucleotide sequences of mutant genes were checked (Genome express). The mutant proteins were produced and extracted from E. coli BL21 cells as described above for the wild type PelI. Their amounts were estimated by immunoblotting with PelI antibodies, and then equivalent quantities of each mutant protein and the wild type PelI were used in enzyme assay. Pectate lyase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the formation of unsaturated products from pectin. The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 or 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 g·liter-1 pectin with a degree of methylation of 45%. The appearance of unsaturated products was monitored at 37 °C over a period of 30 s with 6-s intervals and used to calculate enzyme activity as described (6Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Crystallization—Crystals of PelI were grown as reported previously (22Castang S.

They belong to space group P21 with unit-cell parameters a = 61.6 Å, b = 70.7 Å, c = 73.4 Å, β = 112.8° and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

A 1:1 ratio of protein to reservoir solution was used. Crystals belong to space group P212121 and have cell dimensions a = 45.4 Å, b = 62.6 Å, c = 128.1 Å. The calculated Vm is 1.9 Å3/Da for two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the Michaelis complex was obtained by soaking a crystal of PelI for 24 h in the crystallization buffer depleted in zinc sulfate and with increasing concentrations of GalA4 (1, 2, 3 mm). These successive soakings were performed in calcium-free solutions at pH 6.5 to avoid enzymatic reaction. The soaking experiment induces a significant modification of unit cell parameters up to a = 61.2 Å, b = 68.7 Å, c = 73.4 Å, β = 113.9°. X-ray Diffraction Experiments and Structure Determinations—Before data collection, all crystals were rapidly transferred into a cryoprotectant solution consisting of the crystallization solution plus 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Synchrotron data were collected at 100 K at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamlines, Grenoble, France. The programs XDS and XSCALE were used for data reduction and scaling (statistics in Table 1). 5% of randomly selected reflections were kept apart for cross-validation, and the crystallographic refinement was performed with CNS using the method of slow cooling simulated annealing (23Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab PelI—The first model of PelI was obtained at 1.6 Å resolution by single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of a gold derivative (22Castang S. Shevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Legrand P. Haser R. Gouet P. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A native structure was subsequently determined to 1.45 Å resolution from synchrotron data collected at 100 K at a wavelength of 0.94 Å at beamline BM30A. The crystallographic refinement yields an R-factor of 16.8% (Rfree 19.5%). The model contains two monomers, termed A and B. Residues 108-118 were not visible in electron density maps. According to geometric criteria and to the highest peaks in the 2Fo - Fc maps, five Zn2+ and two Ca2+ ions substitute the seven gold ions observed in the derivative structure. Zn2+ ions were further identified by collecting synchrotron data around the zinc K edge and calculating anomalous difference Fourier maps. An extra Zn2+ ion was positioned in the final structure as well as one SO42-, seven ethylene glycol, and 752 water molecules. PelIcata—Data were collected to 2.1 Å resolution at beamline ID14-3. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and a two-body search taking as a model the catalytic domain from the structure of PelI (residues 119-344). The first two residues of PelIcata (residues 117-118) are not visible in electron density maps as in the PelI structure. The final R-factor is 20.4% (Rfree 27.1%). Two Ca2+ and four Zn2+ are observed at positions similar to those of PelI. Two SO42- and 325 water molecules have been placed in the asymmetric unit. PelI-GalA4—Data were collected to 2.3 Å resolution at a wavelength of 0.93 Å at beamline ID14-3. Attempts to solve the structure of the complex by a crystallographic rigid body refinement were unsuccessful due to non-isomorphous crystals (shift in β angle). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and a two-body search based on the substrate-free structure. Fo - Fc maps were inspected after crystallographic refinement using CNS. The tetrasaccharide bound to molecule A is unambiguously defined in electron density, whereas the one bound to molecule B is weakly defined at its non-reducing end. The four sugar rings of the two ligands were built and oriented in the electron density. No electron density was found for segments 148-150 and 216-222 from monomer A and segments 77-81, 145-150, and 215-222 from monomer B. These amino acids were deleted from the refined structure as well as one Ca2+ and five Zn2+ ions. Further cycles of crystallographic refinement yield an R-factor of 20.0% (Rfree 27.9%). The final model contains two GalA4, one Ca2+ ion, one Zn2+ ion, and 171 water molecules. Structure Analysis—Secondary structure elements were assigned according to main-chain hydrogen bonds and φ/ψ angles calculated with STRIDE (27Frishman D. Argos P. Proteins. 1995; 23: 566-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Pair-wise structure comparison was accomplished with DaliLite (28Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Images of sequence alignments were prepared using ESPript/ENDscript (29Gouet P. Robert X. Courcelle E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3320-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Interactions between tetragalacturonate and PelI were examined with LIGPLOT (30Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4177) Google Scholar). Other images were generated with Molscript/Bobscript (31Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar, 32Esnouf R. Acta Cryst. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 938-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates and structure factors of PelI, PelIcata, and PelI-GalA4 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the codes 3B4N, 3B90, and 3B8Y, respectively. Overall Fold of PelI—The structure of full-length PelI has been determined to 1.45 Å resolution. The protein crystallizes with two monomers, A and B, in the asymmetric unit but is monomeric in solution according to gel filtration experiments (not shown). The two monomers A and B are very similar, and their Cα traces can be superimposed with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.4 Å. PelI is composed of a fibronectin type III domain (Fn3D) at its N terminus (residues 20-107) fused to a catalytic domain that displays a parallel β-helix fold (residues 119-331). The connecting segment where cleavage by E. chrysanthemi proteases occurs (residues 108-118) (6Shevchik V.E. Boccara M. Vedel R. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1459-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was not observed in the density and is not modeled. This linker is also predicted as natively disordered by the Regional Order Neural Network server (33Yang Z.R. Thomson R. McNeil P. Esnouf R.M. Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and the crystallographic packing was carefully examined to identify the biological monomer. The more plausible arrangement of entire protein is presented in Fig. 1A. It possesses the largest buried interface between the two domains, 750 Å2, as well as the shortest distance between residues 107 and 119, 23 Å. Such spacing agrees with the 11 missing residues. The occluded face of the catalytic domain is also partially covered in numerous polysaccharide lyases by N-terminal or C-terminal extensions. Moreover, this arrangement between domains evokes the one recently described in a modular bacterial glycoside hydrolase YeGH28 (Protein Data Bank code 2UVE) (16Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Fn3 domain is bound to the opposite of the active site in both proteins but is oriented perpendicularly to the β-helix axis in PelI and parallel in YeGH28. Fn3 Domain—The N-terminal domain of PelI exhibits a conventional seven-stranded Fn3 fold with a Greek key motif composed of four β-strands termed βC, βC′, βF, and βG (Fig. 1). As reported in some other animal and bacterial Fn3Ds, the last strand βG is split into two short strands (34Jee J.G. Ikegami T. Hashimoto M. Kawabata T. Ikeguchi M. Watanabe T. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Fn3D does not contain any disulfide bonds and interacts with the catalytic domain via its flat βA, βB, βE, façade (Fig. 1A). Two hydrophobic residues, Met25 and Tyr34, give extensive contacts at this interface, whereas polar residues mediate hydrogen bonds (Ser27, Ser38, and Thr72, Fig. 1B). A structural search performed with the DALI server shows that this N-terminal domain superimposes with the best match on an Fn3 module of a neural cell adhesion molecule (r.m.s.d. of 2 Å for 85 aligned Cα with an amino acid identity of 13%) (Protein Data Bank code 1CFB) (35Huber A.H. Wang Y.M. Bieber A.J. Bjorkman P.J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 717-731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It superimposes also extremely well on the Fn3D of the modular YeGH28 polygalacturonase (16Abbott D.W. Boraston A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which includes an additional helix-loop-helix motif that further stabilizes the interdomain interface (r.m.s.d. of 2 Å for 79 aligned Cα and a sequence identity of 11%). Fn3Ds are found in many eukaryotic proteins, where they are frequently implicated in cell adhesion and signaling processes (36Bork P. Doolittle R.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1185-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). They display a variety of binding modes with other proteins, especially via their BC, C′E, and FG loops (37Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Leahy D.J. Hendrickson W.A. Aukhil I. Erickson H.P. Science. 1992; 258: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Fn3Ds have also been reported in bacterial carbohydrate active enzymes, where they may act as spacers between sugar-binding and catalytic domains (34Jee J.G. Ikegami T. Hashimoto M. Kawabata T. Ikeguchi M. Watanabe T. Shirakawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1388-1397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that they can help binding of sugar groups or promote hydrolysis (39Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. Busby T.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12548-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 40Kataeva I.A. Seidel III, R.D. Shah A. West L.T. Li X.L. Ljungdahl L.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4292-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, the distinctive features of carbohydrate binding modules such as a large aromatic platform or a bound Ca2+ (41Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar) are not detected on the Fn3D surface of PelI. Moreover, PelI displays the same enzyme activity"
https://openalex.org/W2050403296,"Human apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is a 46-kDa exchangeable plasma protein with many proposed functions. It is involved in chylomicron assembly and secretion, protection from atherosclerosis through a variety of mechanisms, and inhibition of food intake. There is little structural basis for these proposed functions due to the lack of a solved three-dimensional structure of the protein by x-ray crystallography or NMR. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that lipid-free apoA-IV exists in a helical bundle, like other apolipoprotein family members and that regions near the N and C termini may interact. Utilizing a homobifunctional lysine cross-linking agent, we identified 21 intramolecular cross-links by mass spectrometry. These cross-links were used to constrain the building of a sequence threaded homology model using the I-TASSER server. Our results indicate that lipid-free apoA-IV does indeed exist as a complex helical bundle with the N and C termini in close proximity. This first structural model of lipid-free apoA-IV should prove useful for designing studies aimed at understanding how apoA-IV interacts with lipids and possibly with unknown protein partners."
https://openalex.org/W2078339163,"Adenoviruses use the short noncoding RNA transcript virus-associated (VA) RNA(I) to counteract two critical elements of the host cell defense system, innate cellular immunity and RNA interference, mediated by the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and Dicer/RNA-induced silencing complex, respectively. We progressively shortened the VA RNA(I) terminal stem to examine its necessity for inhibition of PKR. Each deletion, up to 15 bp into the terminal stem, resulted in a cumulative decrease in PKR inhibitory activity. Remarkably, however, despite significant apparent destabilization of the RNA structure, the final RNA mutant that lacked the entire terminal stem (TSDelta21 RNA) efficiently bound PKR and exhibited wild-type inhibitory activity. TSDelta21 RNA stability was strongly influenced by solution pH, indicating the involvement of a protonated base within the VA RNA(I) central domain tertiary structure. Gel filtration chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry analysis indicated that wild-type VA RNA(I) and TSDelta21 RNA form similar 1:1 complexes with PKR but that the latter lacks secondary binding site(s) that might be provided by the terminal stem. Although TSDelta21 RNA bound PKR with wild-type K(d), and overall change in free energy (DeltaG), the thermodynamics of binding (DeltaH and DeltaS) were significantly altered. These results demonstrate that the VA RNA(I) terminal stem is entirely dispensable for inhibition of PKR. Potentially, VA RNA(I) is therefore a truly bi-functional RNA; Dicer processing of the VA RNA(I) terminal stem saturates the RNA interference system while generating a ""mini-VA RNA(I)"" molecule that remains fully active against PKR."
https://openalex.org/W1987516129,"Background Advanced intercross lines (AIL) are segregating populations created using a multi-generation breeding protocol for fine mapping complex trait loci (QTL) in mice and other organisms. Applying QTL mapping methods for intercross and backcross populations, often followed by naïve permutation of individuals and phenotypes, does not account for the effect of AIL family structure in which final generations have been expanded and leads to inappropriately low significance thresholds. The critical problem with naïve mapping approaches in AIL populations is that the individual is not an exchangeable unit. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of family structure has immediate implications for the optimal AIL creation (many crosses, few animals per cross, and population expansion before the final generation) and we discuss these and the utility of AIL populations for QTL fine mapping. We also describe Genome Reshuffling for Advanced Intercross Permutation, (GRAIP) a method for analyzing AIL data that accounts for family structure. GRAIP permutes a more interchangeable unit in the final generation crosses – the parental genome – and simulating regeneration of a permuted AIL population based on exchanged parental identities. GRAIP determines appropriate genome-wide significance thresholds and locus-specific P-values for AILs and other populations with similar family structures. We contrast GRAIP with naïve permutation using a large densely genotyped mouse AIL population (1333 individuals from 32 crosses). A naïve permutation using coat color as a model phenotype demonstrates high false-positive locus identification and uncertain significance levels, which are corrected using GRAIP. GRAIP also detects an established hippocampus weight locus and a new locus, Hipp9a. Conclusions and Significance GRAIP determines appropriate genome-wide significance thresholds and locus-specific P-values for AILs and other populations with similar family structures. The effect of family structure has immediate implications for the optimal AIL creation and we discuss these and the utility of AIL populations."
https://openalex.org/W2034507082,"Sterile-alpha-motif (SAM) domains are common protein interaction motifs observed in organisms as diverse as yeast and human. They play a role in protein homo- and hetero-interactions in processes ranging from signal transduction to RNA binding. In addition, mutations in SAM domain and SAM-mediated oligomers have been linked to several diseases. To date, the observation of heterogeneous SAM-mediated oligomers in vivo has been elusive, which represents a common challenge in dissecting cellular biochemistry in live-cell systems. In this study, we report the oligomerization and binding stoichiometry of high-order, multi-component complexes of (SAM) domain proteins Ste11 and Ste50 in live yeast cells using fluorescence fluctuation methods. Fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) and 1-dimensional photon counting histogram (1dPCH) confirm the SAM-mediated interaction and oligomerization of Ste11 and Ste50. Two-dimensional PCH (2dPCH), with endogenously expressed proteins tagged with GFP or mCherry, uniquely indicates that Ste11 and Ste50 form a heterogeneous complex in the yeast cytosol comprised of a dimer of Ste11 and a monomer of Ste50. In addition, Ste50 also exists as a high order oligomer that does not interact with Ste11, and the size of this oligomer decreases in response to signals that activate the MAP kinase cascade. Surprisingly, a SAM domain mutant of Ste50 disrupted not only the Ste50 oligomers but also Ste11 dimerization. These results establish an in vivo model of Ste50 and Ste11 homo- and hetero-oligomerization and highlight the usefulness of 2dPCH for quantitative dissection of complex molecular interactions in genetic model organisms such as yeast."

An increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio is a common characteristic of most cases of familial Alzheimer disease (FAD)-linked PS mutations. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying amyloid precursor protein proteolysis leading to increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios still remain unclear. Here, we report our findings on the enzymatic analysis of γ-secretase derived from I213T mutant PS1-expressing PS1/PS2-deficient (PS–/–) cells and from the brains of I213T mutant PS1 knock-in mice. Kinetics analyses revealed that the FAD mutation reduced de novo Aβ generation, suggesting that mutation impairs the total catalytic rate of γ-secretase. Analysis of each Aβ species revealed that the FAD mutation specifically reduced Aβ40 levels more drastically than Aβ42 levels, leading to an increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. By contrast, the FAD mutation increased the generation of longer Aβ species such as Aβ43, Aβ45, and >Aβ46. These results were confirmed by analyses of γ-secretase derived from I213T knock-in mouse brains, in which the reduction of de novo Aβ generation was mutant allele dose-dependent. Our findings clearly indicate that the mechanism underlying the increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio observed in cases of FAD mutations is related to the differential inhibition of γ-site cleavage reactions, in which the reaction producing Aβ40 is subject to more inhibition than that producing Aβ42. Our results also provide novel insight into how enhancing the generation of longer Aβs may contribute to Alzheimer disease onset.

The significant neurotoxicity of oligomeric and/or fibrillar Aβ aggregates indicates that accumulation of Aβ is a central pathogenic event in AD (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). Sequential cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases releases Aβ into the luminal/extracellular space. β-secretase is a membrane-bound aspartic protease (identified as BACE) that cleaves the extracellular region of APP to produce membrane-spanning APP C-terminal fragment β (termed CTFβ or C99) and a N-terminal secreted form of APPβ. The intramembranous region of CTFβ is cleaved next by γ-secretase to produce Aβ and APP intracellular domain, and because of the loose site specificity of γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis, various C-terminal truncated Aβ species, including two major species, Aβ40 and Aβ42, are also generated (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). Aβ40 is the most predominant species of secreted Aβ. Aβ42 is hypothesized to be the trigger species for AD-related amyloid pathophysiology, because it has much faster aggregation potential than Aβ40. Indeed, histochemical and biochemical studies have revealed that Aβ42 primarily deposits within the brains of AD patients and several animal models (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H.

In this way, γ-secretase-mediated Aβ metabolism may be critically involved in the onset of AD.Accumulating evidence strongly indicates that γ-secretase is a high molecular weight membrane protein complex in which PS serves as a catalytic subunit (10Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Cell. 2007; 131: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). PS proteins are hydrophobic multiple membrane-spanning proteins that become activated through endoproteolysis of its large cytosolic loop domain, producing N- and C-terminal fragments (11Takasugi N.

The N- and C-terminal fragments incorporate into the stable high molecular weight complex, which consists of at least three minimum cofactors: nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2 (11Takasugi N. Tomita T.

Two conserved aspartate (Asp257 and Asp385 in PS1) residues, which are located within transmembrane domains 6 and 7, form the predicted active center of the PS/γ-secretase complex (10Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Cell. 2007; 131: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Various type I membrane protein substrates, including APP and Notch, undergo regulated intramembranous proteolysis within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer environment (14De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 15Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).On the basis of this model, we hypothesize that the mechanisms underlying the increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio observed in cases of FAD-linked PS mutations might directly reflect an alteration of the enzymatic characteristics of the PS/γ-secretase complex. More than 150 FAD-linked mutations have been identified in PS genes (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). These widely distribute to every sequence of PS proteins, indicating that each mutation can potentially modify the catalytic reactions of γ-secretase enzyme in a distinct manner. Numerous cell culture studies have revealed various aspects of PS mutations and their effects; nevertheless, experimental differences, such as the variations in cell models, detection systems, and normalization methodology, among individual studies make the study of PS mutations through living cell-based methods a controversial issue (16Wolfe M.S. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 17De Strooper B. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Traditionally, γ-secretase was believed to mainly hydrolyze the covalent bonds at Val40–Ile41 and Ala42–Thr43 of CTFβ (termed γ-sites), generating Aβ40 and Aβ42, respectively (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5121) Google Scholar). The γ-sites were thus regarded as the major cleavage sites targeted by γ-secretase. However, recent studies have revealed novel cleavage sites: γ-secretase also mediates the cleavage of ζ- and ϵ-sites, which are closer to the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (18Weidemann A. Eggert S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50647-50650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cleavage at the ζ- and ϵ-sites produces various longer Aβ (>Aβ43) species, and evidence indicates that these species may be processed to shorter Aβ species in stages (21Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 3952-3960Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis consists of multiple complicated cleavage reactions that relate to each other along the transmembrane domain of APP-CTFβ. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how FAD mutations modify overall γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP, leading to increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios. The molecular mechanisms underlying this process also remain elusive. This crucial issue requires more careful assessment from the aspect of the enzymatic characteristics of the PS/γ-secretase complex.These findings prompted us to evaluate the activity kinetics of the wild-type (WT) and FAD mutant PS1/γ-secretase enzyme by using a CHAPSO solubilization γ-secretase assay system (23Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This strategy has great advantages because it enables us not only to directly assess the effect of mutations on the enzyme in cell models but also in brain tissues, which should better reflect the physiological status of the enzyme in vivo. We previously generated PS1/PS2-deficient cell lines that stably express either the WT or FAD mutant forms of human PS1 (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports (8Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Verhamme J. Tolia A. Horre K. Wiltfang J. Esselmann H. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 9Kumar-Singh S. Theuns J. Van Broeck B. Pirici D. Vennekens K. Corsmit E. Cruts M. Dermaut B. Wang R. Van Broeckhoven C. Hum. Mutat. 2006; 27: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that FAD mutations reduced the secretion of Aβ peptides (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, one possible mechanism underlying increased Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios is that FAD mutations might directly impair the enzymatic activity of γ-secretase, thereby modifying the individual cleavage reactions that produce Aβ40 and Aβ42. In this study, we specifically focused on the effect of the I213T FAD-linked PS1 mutation on γ-secretase and reported the enzymatic characteristics of γ-secretase derived both from cell models and from the brains of knock-in mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Anti-PS1 N-terminal mouse monoclonal antibody (AD3.4, 1:1,000) and anti-PS1 C-terminal rabbit polyclonal antibody (AD3C, 1:1,000) were described previously (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C-terminal sequences of APH-1aL (ACS-01, 1:1,000) and PEN-2 (PCS-01, 1:1,000) were generated previously (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal region of nicastrin was purchased from Chemicon. End-specific antibodies against Aβ N-terminal (82E1, 1:100); Aβ40 (1A10, 1:50); and Aβ42 C-terminal (1:50) were purchased from IBL.Plasmid DNA Constructs and Cell Cultures—PS+/+ and PS1/PS2-deficient (PS–/–) mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (kindly provided by Dr. B.

PS–/– MEF-based cell lines stably expressing either WT or I213T FAD mutant human PS1 were described previously (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To establish cell lines that stably express dominant negative mutant D257A human PS1, we generated cDNA by using a conventional two-step PCR protocol and a primer pair for D257A (5′-ATT TCA GTA TAT GCT TTA GTG GCT GTT-3′ and 5′-AAC AGC CAC TAA AGC ATA TAC TGA AAT-3′). The cDNA was then subcloned into the EcoRI/XhaI site of a pCI-Bls vector; the DNA sequence was confirmed with an ABI DNA sequencer. After transfection into PS–/– MEF cells, several clonal lines were selected in 7.5 μg/ml blasticidin S. All stable cell lines were maintained in growth medium containing 5.0 μg/ml blasticidin S.I213T Knock-in Mice—We genotyped 11.0–12.5-month-old homozygous (I213T/I213T, n = 4), hemizygous (+/I213T, n = 9), and control (+/+, n = 5) I213T mutant PS1 knock-in mice for WT and mutant alleles by PCR, as described previously (28Nakano Y.

Fresh whole brains were immediately dissected and used for further biochemical preparations and enzyme assays. All procedures involving animals and their care were approved by the Animal Care Use Committee of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute.Preparation of Solubilized γ-Secretase and Recombinant APP-C99-FLAG Substrate—Semi-confluent cultured cells (60 × 100-mm dish) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm pH blocker) using a Teflon homogenizer (1,200 rpm, 20 strokes). After removal of nuclei and cell debris through two centrifugations (1,500 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), the post-nuclear supernatant was ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h). The precipitate was washed with homogenization buffer, ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), and finally collected as crude microsomal membranes. These membranes were then resuspended with resuspension buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EGTA), and the amount of protein was quantitated with a BCA kit (Pierce). Protein was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. To prepare enzyme fractions, we added equal amounts of 2× NK buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 2% (w/v) CHAPSO, 10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pH blocker, 20 μg/ml TLCK, 10 mm 1.10-phenanthroline, and 2 mm thiorphan) to the membrane suspension and incubated the mixture for 1 h on ice. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), the supernatant containing solubilized γ-secretase was collected and stored at –80 °C.Baculovirally expressed recombinant C99-FLAG substrate was prepared as described previously (24Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates from C99-FLAG-overexpressing Sf9 cells were extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) on ice for 1 h. After ultracentrifugation (245,000 × g, 20 min), solubilized C99-FLAG was agitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight. After sequential washing of the beads with 50-fold bed volumes of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in lysis buffer, bound C99-FLAG was eluted by adding 100 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.7). Eluted C99-FLAG was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris base. The resulting solution was further concentrated with a Centricon YM-3 (3,000 MWCO) and then stored at –80 °C until use.In Vitro CHAPSO-solubilized γ-Secretase Assay—In vitro γ-secretase-mediated de novo Aβ generation was measured by using a method described previously (24Kakuda N.

Briefly, 1% CHAPSO-solubilized γ-secretase was mixed with 3 volumes of CHAPSO-free assay buffer (50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 μg/ml antipain, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 μm pH blocker, 10 μg/ml TLCK, 5 mm 1.10-phenanthroline, 1 mm thiorphan, and 0.133% (w/v) phosphatidylcholine) and incubated with 0.1–2.5 μm recombinant C99-FLAG substrate at 37 °C. As previous studies mentioned, 0.1% phosphatidylcholine enhances the basal levels of Aβ generation without affecting the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio (24Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14776-14786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 30Kimberly W.T. Esler W.P. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Gao J. Diehl T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The final concentration of C99-FLAG stock solution containing Nonidet P-40 in the reactions was roughly estimated to be <0.07%, a concentration that does not noticeably affect de novo Aβ production. To quantitate de novo generated Aβs, samples were collected at different time points and excess lipids in the assay mixture were removed by adding CHCl3:MeOH (2:1) and CHCl3:MeOH:MilliQ (1:2:0.8). After drying, sample pellets were re-dissolved in 1× Sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis with Aβ N- or C-terminal end-specific antibodies. To detect various longer Aβ species, Aβ1–37 through Aβ1–46 were separated by SDS-PAGE and 8 m urea-containing modified Tris-Tricine gels, and 82E1 antibody was used as a probe (21Qi-Takahara Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Tanimura Y. Dolios G. Hirotani N. Horikoshi Y. Kametani F. Maeda M. Saido T.C. Wang R. Ihara Y. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All quantitated data were calculated by comparing chemiluminescence signal intensities of Aβ species to synthetic Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42 standard calibration curves (AnaSpec or Peptide Inc.). Inhibition analyses were performed with two γ-secretase-specific inhibitors, DAPT and WPE-III-31C, purchased from Calbiochem (final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was <1.0% (v/v)).Calculation of Kinetics Constants—Michaelis-Menten kinetics constants (Vmax and Km) were calculated by fitting experimental data to Lineweaver-Burk plots according to the equation 1/[V] = Km/Vmax[S] + 1/Vmax, where [V] is the reaction velocity of Aβ generation, and [S] is the concentration of the APP-C99-FLAG substrate. To calculate the values of Vmax and Km, experimentally measured values of [V] determined from experiments using a range of high C99-FLAG concentrations were used for linear fitting because [V] measured from experiments using low C99-FLAG concentrations contains a large experimental error, which interferes with appropriate linear fitting.Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance of data were tested with a Student's t test or a Tukey-Kramer test. Data were analyzed with InStat version 3.0a (GraphPad).RESULTSEnzymatic Characteristics of Wild-type PS1/γ-Secretase in PS–/– MEF Cell Models—To characterize γ-secretase activity using a CHAPSO-solubilized assay system, first we solubilized purified crude microsomal membranes from PS+/+ MEF, PS–/– MEF, and WT line 38 (WT38) cells, which stably express endogenous levels of WT human PS1 on a PS–/– MEF background, and incubated these membranes with 500 nm C99-FLAG. Immunoblotting with anti-Aβ N- and C-terminal end-specific antibodies showed that PS+/+ MEF lysates displayed robust amounts of de novo Aβ generation, including Aβ40 and Aβ42 generation after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 1, A and B). Relatively higher Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios (about 40–50%) compared with secreted Aβ ratios were observed in this assay system (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). By contrast, immunoblotting of PS–/– MEF lysates failed to detect any Aβ, even after 4 h of incubation, thus completely excluding possible PS-independent nonspecific de novo Aβ generation activity due to contaminating proteases. As expected, expression of WT human PS1 significantly restored de novo Aβ generation activity to levels similar to those detected in PS+/+ MEF lysates (Fig. 1, A and B). We observed a slightly lower Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in reaction mixtures containing WT38 lysates compared with those containing PS+/+ MEF lysates. This difference might reflect the absence of PS2 or differences between mouse and human PS1 species.To examine the reaction kinetics of in vitro γ-secretase, next we monitored the time course of Aβ generation. The levels of each Aβ species increased in a linear fashion for up to 5 h, indicating that the initial velocity of the enzyme-substrate reaction was stable during this period (data not shown). The rate of Aβ generation fit to a Michaelis-Menten-like reaction curve (Fig. 1C). Vmax values for PS+/+ MEF and WT38 lysates were 790.60 ± 37.01 pm/min and 686.80 ± 198.73 pm/min, respectively, and Km values were 2.08 ± 0.13 μm and 2.26 ± 1.40 μm, respectively (Fig. 1C). These results approximately corresponded to those of previous studies (23Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and suggest that the enzymatic characteristics of γ-secretase in both types of cell lysates are not much different. The Vmax and Km values of Aβ40 for PS+/+ MEF lysates were 150.99 ± 33.77 pm/min and 0.90 ± 0.30 μm, respectively, and the Vmax and Km values of Aβ40 for WT38 were 124.27 ± 12.68 pm/min and 0.70 ± 0.07 nm, respectively. However, we could not estimate the Vmax and Km of Aβ42 because de novo Aβ42 levels continuously increased with increasing concentrations of C99-FLAG, resulting in a linear fit to the Lineweaver-Burk plot, which did not provide us with appropriate intercept values of the 1/[V] axis and 1/[S] axis. This difference in kinetics suggests the possibility that Aβ40 and Aβ42 are generated from distinct reactions. As recent studies have mentioned, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio gradually increases with increasing C99-FLAG concentrations (24Kakuda N. Funamoto S. Yagishita S. Takami M. Osawa S. Dohmae N. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

We confirmed this premise by demonstrating that expression of dominant negative human D257A mutant PS1 failed to restore de novo Aβ synthesis in PS–/– MEF cells and that 1% Triton X-100 solubilization, which disrupts the interaction of PS complex components, completely abolished Aβ generation (data not shown). The γ-secretase-specific inhibitors DAPT (data not shown) and WPE-III-31C (Fig. 1D) significantly suppressed the generation of each Aβ species in a dose-dependent manner at IC50 values of ∼100 nm DAPT and ∼10 nm WPE-III-31C. To evaluate expression levels of PS1 and de novo generation level of Aβ, we analyzed six independent stable cell lines, including the WT38 line (supplemental Fig. 1) (25Shimojo M. Sahara N. Murayama M. Ichinose H. Takashima A. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 57: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After incubation of the membrane fractions with 500 nm C99-FLAG, a linear correlation between PS1 levels and Aβ levels was observed (Fig. 1E), even though the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio remained unchanged among these cell lines (supp"
https://openalex.org/W2015370262,"We previously found that triggering TLR7/8 either by single stranded HIV RNA or synthetic compounds induced changes in the lymphoid microenvironment unfavorable to HIV. In this study, we used selective TLR7 and 8 agonists to dissect their contribution to the anti-HIV effects. While triggering TLR7 inhibited efficiently HIV replication in lymphoid suspension cells from tonsillar origin, its effect was inconsistent in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In contrast, triggering TLR8 showed a very prominent and overall very consistent effect in PBMC and tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells. Depletion of dendritic cells (DC), Natural killer cells (NK) and CD8+ T-cells from PBMC resulted in the reversal of TLR8 induced anti-HIV effects. Especially noteworthy, depletion of either NK or CD8+ T-cells alone was only partially effective. We interpret these findings that DC are the initiator of complex changes in the microenvironment that culminates in the anti-HIV active NK and CD8+ effector cells. The near lack of NK and the low number of CD8+ T-cells in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells may explain the lower TLR8 agonist's anti-HIV effects in that tissue. However, additional cell-type specific differences must exist since the TLR7 agonists had a very strong inhibitory effect in tonsillar lymphoid suspension cells. Separation of effector from the CD4+ target cells did not abolish the anti-HIV effects pointing to the critical role of soluble factors. Triggering TLR7 or 8 were accompanied by major changes in the cytokine milieu; however, it appeared that not a single soluble factor could be assigned for the potent effects. These results delineate the complex effects of triggering TLR7/8 for an efficient antiviral defense. While the ultimate mechanism(s) remains unknown, the potent effects described may have therapeutic value for treating chronic viral diseases.

To gain insight into the physiological importance of PDK1 in cell proliferation and cell cycle control, we established immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice homozygous for a “floxed” allele of Pdk1 and from wild-type mice. Introduction of Cre recombinase by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer resulted in the depletion of PDK1 in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs but not in Pdk1+/+ MEFs. The insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation of various downstream effectors of PDK1, including Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3, ribosomal protein S6, and p70 S6 kinase, was markedly inhibited in the PDK1-depleted (Pdk1-KO) MEFs. The rate of serum-induced cell proliferation was reduced; progression of the cell cycle from the G0-G1 phase to the S phase was delayed, and cell cycle progression at G2-M phase was impaired in Pdk1-KO MEFs. These cells also manifested an increased level of p27Kip1 expression and a reduced level of cyclin D1 expression during cell cycle progression. The defect in cell cycle progression from the G0-G1 to the S phase in Pdk1-KO MEFs was rescued by forced expression of cyclin D1, whereas rescue of the defect in G2-M progression in these cells required both overexpression of cyclin D1 and depletion of p27Kip1 by RNA interference. These data indicate that PDK1 plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by controlling the expression of both cyclin D1 and p27Kip1.

Although the Pdk1 knock-out mouse is not viable (15Lawlor M.A. Mora A. Ashby P.R. Williams M.R. Murray-Tait V. Malone L. Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3728-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), mice that harbor a hypomorphic Pdk1 allele, in which the abundance of PDK1 is reduced to 10% of that in wild-type mice, are viable but fail to produce mature T cells as a result of a defect in the differentiation and proliferation of this lineage (16Hinton H.J. Alessi D.R. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01), an inhibitor of PDK1, was shown to abrogate tumor cell growth and to promote apoptosis (17Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1727-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Depletion of PDK1 with the use of either an antisense oligonucleotide or RNA interference also inhibited proliferation of a glioblastoma cell line (18Bilanges B. Stokoe D. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These various observations thus suggested that PDK1 regulates cell proliferation. However, mouse embryonic stem cells in which both copies of Pdk1 were disrupted were viable and proliferated at a rate similar to that of wild-type cells (3Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The relevance of PDK1 to cell proliferation and the underlying mechanism of any regulatory role have thus remained unclear. To examine the role of PDK1-dependent signaling in cell proliferation and control of the cell cycle, we have now investigated the effects of PDK1 deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We here show that lack of PDK1 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation but did not promote apoptosis in MEFs, and that this inhibition of proliferation was attributable to a delayed transition from the G0-G1 to the S phase and to slowed progression at the G2-M phase of the cell cycle. We also show that control of cell cycle progression by PDK1 requires the induction of cyclin D1 expression at the transition from the G0-G1 to the S phase and the coordinated regulation of cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 expression at G2-M. Our findings thus reveal an important regulatory role for PDK1 in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PDK1 were kindly provided by F.

Nolan, Stanford University, Stanford, CA) or into pMXs containing the puromycin resistance gene (kindly provided by T. Kitamura, University of Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Plat-E retrovirus-packaging cells were kindly provided by T. Kitamura. Generation of PDK1 Knock-out MEFs and Rescue of PDK1 Expression—Mice homozygous for a “floxed” allele of Pdk1 in which exons 3 and 4 are flanked by LoxP sequences (Pdk1lox/lox mice) were described previously (20Inoue H.

Embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from Pdk1lox/lox and the corresponding wild-type (Pdk1+/+) mice at embryonic day 13.5 and were immortalized by the 3T3 protocol (21Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). To disrupt Pdk1 in the immortalized MEFs harboring the floxed allele, we introduced a retroviral vector for Cre recombinase into the cells as described previously (22Mori T. Sakaue H. Iguchi H. Gomi H. Okada Y. Takashima Y. Nakamura K. Nakamura T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Kadowaki T. Matsuki Y. Ogawa W. Hiramatsu R. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Cells resistant to blasticidin S (10 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) were selected, and the resulting PDK1 knock-out (Pdk1-KO) MEFs were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing glucose at 4.5 g/liter and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (50 μg/ml), referred to hereafter as culture medium. Pdk1-KO MEFs stably expressing PDK1 (Pdk1-KO/PDK1 MEFs) were similarly generated by infection with a retroviral vector for PDK1 and were selected on the basis of resistance to puromycin (2 μg/ml) (Sigma). Cells were stimulated with recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Sigma) after incubation for 16 h in serum-free medium. Adenoviral Vectors and Infection—Adenoviral vectors for mouse cyclin D1 tagged with a nuclear localization signal (AdD1NLS) and for a small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for rat and mouse p27Kip1 mRNA (Adp27siRNA) were described previously (23Tamamori-Adachi M. Hayashida K. Nobori K. Omizu C. Yamada K. Sakamoto N. Kamura T. Fukuda K. Ogawa S. Nakayama K.I. Kitajima S. J. Biol.

Saito (University of Tokyo, Japan). MEFs were infected with adenoviral vectors essentially as described previously (24Seki T. Irie N. Nakamura K. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Yamamoto H. Ohmori S.

Northern Blot Analysis, Immunoblot Analysis, and Assay of Akt and PI 3-Kinase Activities—Total RNA (10 μg) extracted from cells was subjected to Northern blot analysis with full-length mouse cyclin D1 or p27Kip1 cDNAs as probes. Cell lysates (∼50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis as described (25Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Matsumoto M. Kuroda S. Takata M. Sugimoto T. Spiegelman B.M. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28945-28952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The activity of Akt in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to Akt was assayed with the synthetic Crosstide peptide as substrate (26Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M.

The activity of PI 3-kinase in immunoprecipitates prepared with antibodies to phosphotyrosine was assayed as described (27Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Takata M. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Matsumoto M. Sakaue M. Nishio S. Ueno H. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis—Total RNA (10 μg) isolated from Pdk1+/+ MEFs expressing Cre recombinase (Pdk1+/+/Cre MEFs) or from Pdk1-KO MEFs was used as a template for the synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA, which was then used to probe Genechip Mouse MU74 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were scanned and analyzed as described previously (22Mori T. Sakaue H. Iguchi H. Gomi H. Okada Y. Takashima Y. Nakamura K. Nakamura T. Yamauchi T. Kubota N. Kadowaki T. Matsuki Y. Ogawa W.

Assay of DNA Fragmentation—Cells that had been treated with staurosporine (Sigma) were suspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS) and incubated for 2 h at 50 °C with proteinase K (100 μg/ml) (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The reaction mixture was then subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and DNA was transferred to TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA), incubated with RNase A (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C and subjected to electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide for visualization of DNA fragments. Cell Cycle Synchronization and Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells were cultured overnight in serum-free medium and then subjected to cell cycle arrest by incubation for 16 or 24 h in culture medium containing aphidicolin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) or nocodazole (200 ng/ml) (Sigma), respectively. They were then released from arrest by incubation in drug-free culture medium. Cells were collected by exposure to trypsin and centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed in 75% ethanol at -20 °C. The fixed cells were washed with PBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase A (100 μg/ml), stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences). BrdUrd Staining—Cells were exposed to 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 30 min, harvested, washed with PBS, and subjected to cell cycle analysis with the use of a BrdUrd flow kit (Pharmingen). Labeled cells were detected by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). Immunocytofluorescence Analysis—Cells were seeded on glass coverslips before infection with adenoviral vectors. They were subsequently fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, washed, and incubated consecutively with monoclonal antibodies to p27Kip1 and with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) together with propidium iodide. Images were acquired with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM5 PASCAL, Carl Zeiss). Lack of PDK1 Expression Prevents IGF-1 Signaling—To determine the biological function of PDK1 in cell proliferation, we prepared MEFs from Pdk1+/+ and Pdk1lox/lox mouse embryos and disrupted Pdk1 in the latter cells by infecting them with a retroviral vector encoding Cre recombinase. Although the abundance of PDK1 in Pdk1+/+ MEFs was not affected by infection with the retroviral vector for Cre, PDK1 was not detected in the Cre-expressing Pdk1lox/lox MEFs (Fig. 1A). To confirm that disruption of Pdk1 specifically prevented signaling downstream of PDK1, we first measured the activity of Akt in the Cre-expressing Pdk1lox/lox MEFs (Pdk1-KO MEFs). Whereas IGF-1 induced a marked increase in Akt activity in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs, no such effect was apparent in Pdk1-KO MEFs (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effects of IGF-1 on the activation of downstream effectors of PDK1 signaling by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for phosphorylated forms of these proteins. The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308, which is a target site of PDK1, was completely inhibited in Pdk1-KO MEFs, whereas the basal level of Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 was increased in these cells (Fig. 1C). The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of GSK3α (on Ser21) and GSK3β (on Ser9), two well characterized substrates of Akt, was inhibited in Pdk1-KO MEFs, as was the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of both p70 S6 kinase and ribosomal protein S6 as well as the basal level of S6 phosphorylation. The basal level of phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 was also markedly increased in Pdk1-KO MEFs. The IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of these various signaling molecules was not affected by expression of Cre recombinase in Pdk1+/+ MEFs. These results indicated that IGF-1 signaling mediated by PDK1 was specifically inhibited in Pdk1-KO MEFs. Effects of PDK1 Depletion on Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Progression—We next examined whether PDK1 deficiency affected the proliferation of MEFs. Pdk1+/+ MEFs, Pdk1+/+ MEFs expressing Cre recombinase (Pdk1+/+/Cre MEFs), Pdk1lox/lox MEFs, and Pdk1-KO MEFs were seeded at equal densities, and their numbers were determined at various times up to 8 days. The rate of increase in the number of Pdk1-KO MEFs was substantially reduced compared with that for the other three types of MEFs (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether this slower increase in the number of Pdk1-KO MEFs was because of the induction of apoptosis, we examined the extent of DNA fragmentation in Pdk1lox/lox and Pdk1-KO MEFs cultured in the presence of 50 or 500 nm staurosporine for 1, 4, or 24 h. The level of staurosporine-induced apoptosis did not differ between the two cell types (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the reduced rate of increase in the number of Pdk1-KO MEFs was because of inhibition of proliferation rather than to the induction of apoptosis. We next examined cell cycle progression in Pdk1lox/lox and Pdk1-KO MEFs by flow cytometric analysis. Cells were synchronized in G0-G1 by serum deprivation for 24 h and were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by re-exposure to 10% serum. Whereas ∼60% of Pdk1lox/lox MEFs had entered S phase 14 h after serum stimulation, only ∼20% of Pdk1-KO MEFs had done so (Fig. 3, A and B). At 18 h, ∼40% of Pdk1-KO MEFs had entered S phase, whereas the Pdk1lox/lox cells had progressed to G2-M. The reduced number of Pdk1-KO MEFs in S phase was confirmed by analysis of BrdUrd incorporation. The number of BrdUrd-labeled cells at 14 h after the onset of serum stimulation was thus markedly smaller for Pdk1-KO MEFs than for Pdk1lox/lox MEFs (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that the transition from G0-G1 to S phase is delayed in Pdk1-KO MEFs, suggesting that PDK1 may regulate cell proliferation by controlling molecular events at this transition. PDK1 Regulates the Expression of Cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 during Cell Cycle Progression—We examined the expression of various proteins that contribute to regulation of the transition from the G0-G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Whereas serum stimulation induced a marked increase in the amount of cyclin D1 in Pdk1lox/lox cells, the increase in cyclin D1 expression was inhibited, and the amount of this protein was subsequently decreased in Pdk1-KO MEFs (Fig. 3D). These data suggested that PDK1 might regulate the induction of cyclin D1 associated with serum-stimulated cell cycle progression. Degradation of the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 is required for progression through G0-G1 to S phase (28Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 29Reynisdottir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The amount of p27Kip1 was markedly higher in Pdk1-KO MEFs than in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs before serum stimulation. The addition of serum induced a pronounced down-regulation of p27Kip1 in both cell types, but the abundance of this protein remained higher in Pdk1-KO MEFs than in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs during progression through the S and G2-M phases (Fig. 3D). The degradation of p27Kip1 during the S and G2-M phases is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase SCFSkp2 (30Kamura T. Hara T. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Okumura F. Hatakeyama S. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1229-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The serum-induced up-regulation of Skp2 was delayed in Pdk1-KO MEFs compared with that apparent in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs (Fig. 3D), suggesting that PDK1 might contribute to Skp2 induction and that the delayed induction of Skp2 in Pdk1-KO MEFs is responsible for the increased level of p27Kip1 in these cells during progression from S to G2-M. The level and time course of CDK2, CDK4, and ERK expression were not affected by the lack of PDK1 (Fig. 3D). The abundance of cyclin E was increased in serum-deprived Pdk1-KO MEFs, and the induction of cyclin A expression by serum stimulation was delayed in these cells in parallel with the delayed entry into the S phase (Fig. 3D). Cyclin D1 binds to and activates CDK4 and CDK6, resulting in the phosphorylation of Rb protein, which is required for G1-S transition (31Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4303) Google Scholar, 32Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Rb protein on Ser780, which is targeted by the cyclin D1-CDK4 complex (33Yu B. Lane M.E. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Wadler S. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was detected 6 h after serum stimulation in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs but remained undetected in Pdk1-KO MEFs even 22 h after serum stimulation (Fig. 3D). These results suggested that the impairment in the induction of cyclin D1 in the PDK1-deficient cells results in failure of CDK4-mediated Rb phosphorylation. To determine whether the effects of PDK1 deficiency on cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 expression during cell cycle progression are mediated at the mRNA level, we performed Northern blot analysis. The amount of cyclin D1 mRNA was decreased in Pdk1-KO MEFs before serum stimulation, and the serum-induced increase in the abundance of this mRNA apparent in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs was markedly suppressed in the Pdk1-KO cells (Fig. 3E). In contrast, the amount of p27Kip1 mRNA in Pdk1-KO MEFs was similar to that in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs at all times during cell cycle progression (Fig. 3E). These findings were confirmed by microarray-based analysis of gene expression in Pdk1+/+/Cre and Pdk1-KO MEFs (supplemental Table 1). With the exception of cyclin D1 mRNA, the microarray data revealed no differences between the two cell types in the abundance of mRNAs for G1 cyclins (such as cyclins D2, D3, E1, and E2) or for members of the Ink4 family of CDK inhibitors (such as p15, p18, and p19). These results suggested that PDK1 regulates the expression of cyclin D1 at the level of transcription or mRNA stability and that of p27Kip1 at the level of translation or protein stability. Expression of PDK1 Rescues the Cell Proliferation Defect and the Delayed Transition from G0-G1 to S Phase in PDK1-deficient MEFs—To confirm that the defect in cell proliferation and the delayed transition from the G0-G1 to S phase in Pdk1-KO MEFs was because of depletion of PDK1, we infected these cells with a retroviral vector encoding PDK1. The abundance of PDK1 in the resulting cells (Pdk1-KO/PDK1 MEFs) was only ∼10% of that in Pdk1lox/lox MEFs (Fig. 4A). Ectopic expression of PDK1 in Pdk1-KO MEFs resulted in partial rescue of the IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt on Thr308, of GSK3α (Ser21) and GSK3β (Ser9), of p70 S6 kinase on Thr389, and of S6 on Ser235 and Ser236 (Fig. 4B). Although these IGF-1-induced phosphorylation events were restored only partially, the rate of increase in the number of Pdk1-KO MEFs was fully restored by ectopic expression of PDK1 (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the delay in the transition from the G0-G1 to S phase apparent in Pdk1-KO MEFs was virtually eliminated in Pdk1-KO/PDK1 MEFs (Fig. 4D). The various defects in the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E, Skp2, and p27Kip1 as well as in the phosphorylation of Rb protein on Ser780 during cell cycle progression of Pdk1-KO MEFs were also largely corrected by forced expression of PDK1 (Fig. 4E). Role of Altered Regulation of Cyclin D1 and p27Kip1 Expression in the Proliferation Defect of PDK1-deficient MEFs—We further investigated whether the changes in the cell cycle-dependent expression of cyclin D1 or p27Kip1 induced by loss of PDK1 were responsible for the proliferation defect and delayed transition from G0-G1 to S phase in Pdk1-KO MEFs. Infection of Pdk1-KO MEFs with an adenoviral vector encoding cyclin D1 tagged with a nuclear localization signal (AdD1NLS) resulted in a marked increase in the total abundance of cyclin D1, whereas that with an adenoviral vector encoding an siRNA specific for p27 mRNA (Adp27siRNA) resulted in a pronounced decrease in the amount of p27Kip1 (Fig. 5A). Infection with both AdD1NLS and Adp27siRNA increased the proliferation rate of Pdk1-KO MEFs, whereas infection with either vector alone had no such effect (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, infection with AdD1NLS alone or with both AdD1NLS and Adp27siRNA promoted cell cycle progression from the G0-G1 to S phase in Pdk1-KO MEFs, whereas this transition was not affected by infection with Adp27siRNA alone (Fig. 5C). Ectopic expression of p27Kip1 inhibits CDK2 activity and thereby induces cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase (34Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M.

Expression of D1NLS promoted cell cycle progression through the G1-S transition in Pdk1-KO MEFs despite the high level of p27Kip1 in these cells (Fig. 5, A and C).

https://openalex.org/W2069814684,"Gonadotropin-regulated testicular helicase (GRTH)/DDX25 is an essential post-transcriptional regulator of spermatogenesis. In GRTH null mice severe apoptosis was observed in spermatocytes entering the metaphase of meiosis. Pro- and anti-apoptotic factors were found to be under GRTH regulation in comparative studies of spermatocytes from wild type and GRTH(-/-) knock-out (KO) mice. KO mice displayed decreased levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (anti-apoptotic factors), an increase in Bid, Bak, and Bad (pro-apoptotic), reduced phospho-Bad, and release of cytochrome c. Also, an increase on Smac, a competitor of inhibitor apoptotic proteins that release caspases, was observed. These changes caused an increase in cleavage of caspases 9 and 3, activation of caspase 3 and increases in cleavage products of PARP. The half-life of caspase 3 transcripts was markedly increased in KO, indicating that GRTH had a negative role on its mRNA stability. IkappaBalpha, which sequesters NF-kappaB from its transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic genes, was highly elevated in KO, and its phospho-form, which promotes its dissociation, was reduced. The increase of HDAC1 and abolition of p300 expression in KO indicated a nuclear action of GRTH on the NF-kappaB-mediated transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. It also regulates the associated death domain pathway and caspase 8-mediated events. GRTH-mediated apoptotic regulation was further indicated by its selective binding to pro- and anti-apoptotic mRNAs. These studies have demonstrated that GRTH, as a component of mRNP particles, acts as a negative regulator of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and caspase pathways and promotes NF-kappaB function to control apoptosis in spermatocytes of adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W2053088136,"Human and murine oncostatin M (OSM) induce their bioactivities through a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of gp130 and the OSM receptor (OSMR), which initiates a signaling pathway involving Janus kinases (JAKs) and transcription factors of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family. In contrast to the signal transducing receptor subunit gp130, the OSMR allows strong activation of STAT5B. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the human and murine OSM receptors use distinct mechanisms for STAT5B activation. The human receptor contains a STAT5B recruiting tyrosine motif (Tyr837/Tyr839) C-terminal to the box 1/2 region, which is absent in the mouse receptor. In contrast, the murine receptor initiates STAT5 activation directly via the receptor bound Janus kinases. Intriguingly, the murine receptor preferentially recruits JAK2, whereas the human receptor seems to have a higher affinity for JAK1. We identify a single amino acid (Phe820) in the human receptor that is responsible for this preference. Exchange by the murine counterpart (Cys815) allows recruitment of JAK2 by the human receptor and consequently activation of STAT5B independently of receptor tyrosine motifs. STAT5B interacts directly with JAK2 only in response to activation of the murine OSMR or the mutated human OSMR. Additionally, we show that OSM-induced STAT1 phosphorylation occurs independently of receptor tyrosine motifs and is mediated directly by Janus kinases, whereas the two C-terminally located tyrosine residues Tyr917/Tyr945 of the OSMR are crucial for STAT3 activation.

Human OSM has the exceptional capability to recruit two different types of receptor complexes: the type I receptor complex composed of gp130/LIFR or the type II receptor complex of gp130/OSMR. In contrast, murine OSM solely utilizes the gp130/OSMR heterodimer for signal transduction (7Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol.

Because of its ability to induce TIMP-1 and TIMP-3, pro-fibrotic properties have also been attributed to OSM (17Richards C.D. Shoyab M. Brown T.J. Gauldie J. J.

Hepatology. 2004; 39: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).It is commonly accepted that OSM, besides activating the MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, is one of the strongest inducers of the JAK/STAT pathway (4Heinrich P.C.

After ligand binding and receptor dimerization, the Janus kinase family members JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are activated (27Auguste P. Guillet C. Fourcin M. Olivier C. Veziers J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A.

The so far prevailing perception of the further downstream STAT activation involves recruitment of the STAT factors, particularly STAT1 and STAT3, to phosphorylated tyrosine motifs via their SH2 domains. Only for STAT5 a number of studies describe a receptor tyrosine-independent activation mechanism, which involves direct binding of STAT5 to the receptor-recruited Janus kinases (29Fujitani Y. Hibi M.

However, it remains unclear to date which determinants render receptor-bound kinases susceptible for direct recruitment of STAT5.Here we can show that the human and murine OSM receptors use distinct mechanisms to activate STAT5B. Whereas the human receptor relies on two tyrosine motifs located proximal to the box 1/box 2 region, the murine receptor can activate STAT5B receptor tyrosine-independently. This tyrosine-independent activation requires a direct interaction of STAT5B with JAK2, which is only achieved by ligation of the murine OSMR. Indeed, JAK2 can only be precipitated with the murine OSMR, but not with the human OSMR. Interestingly, a single amino acid exchange within the human box 2 region to the equivalent amino acid in the murine receptor changes the preference of the human receptor for binding JAK1 to JAK2 and allows STAT5B activation independently of the tyrosine motifs. In contrast, the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 is mediated by conserved molecular mechanisms, i.e. for STAT3 through YXXQ motifs in the cytoplasmic part of the receptors and for STAT1 directly via the Janus kinases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture, Transfection, and Cytokines—Primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), human embryonal kidney cells transformed with SV40 (HEK293T), murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), and human fibrosarcoma cells 2C4, U4C, γ2A, 2fTGH, and U1A (kindly provided by Dr. I.

All of the media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 60 μg/ml penicillin. Stably transfected HEK293T cells were selected in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin, 500 μg/ml G418, and 10 μg/ml blasticidin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HDFs were generated as described previously (32Dreuw A. Radtke S. Pflanz S. Lippok B.E. Heinrich P.C. Hermanns H.M. J.

Transient transfections of HEK293T cells were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. HEK293T cells stably expressing the IL-5Rα/gp130YFFFFF, as well as one of the following IL-5Rβ chimeras: β/hOSMRΔ1, β/hOSMRΔ1Y917F/Y945F, and β/hOSMRΔ1-YFFFFFF, were generated by two rounds of transfections: first the IL-5Rα/gp130YFFFFF was integrated by transfection using FuGENE 6 and selection using G418. Thereafter, the clones were again transfected using the Flp-In™ T-REx™ system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Recombinant human IL-5 and human OSM were obtained from Cell Concepts (Umkirch, Germany), human LIF from Sigma, and murine OSM from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Expression Vectors—The construction of the pSVL based expression plasmids encoding IL-5R chimeras α/gp130YFFFFF, β/hOSMRΔ1, β/hOSMRΔ1Y861F, and β/hOSMRbox 1/2 has been described previously (25Hermanns H.M.

Hence, we used truncated chimeric constructs lacking the 28 C-terminal amino acids (β/OSMRΔ1), which is expressed better, without losing any of the activation sites of STATs or MAPKs (28Hermanns H.M.

The C-terminal deletion mutants β/mOSMRΔ1 and β/mOSMRbox 1/2 were generated by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA for murine OSMR as a template (kindly provided by M. Tanaka, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The sense oligonucleotide incorporates an EcoRI site and the antisense oligonucleotides incorporate an in-frame termination codon followed by the recognition site for BamHI. They retain 191 and 65 amino acids of the murine OSMR cytoplasmic tail, respectively, and were subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI-digested expression plasmid pSVL-IL-5Rβ/hOSMRΔ1 to generate the constructs encoding pSVL-β/mOSMRΔ1 and pSVL-β/mOSMRbox 1/2. The human/murine OSMR chimeras were generated by standard PCR techniques, and the sequences are depicted in Fig. 3C. The pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmids for β/hOSMRΔ1, β/hOSMRΔ1-Y917F/Y945F, and β/hOSMR-Δ1YFFFFFF were generated by transferring a NotI/EcoRV fragment from the pSVL constructs to the modified vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) containing an inverted multiple cloning site. The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Science). The expression plasmid for STAT5B was kindly provided by W. Doppler (University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria).Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—HDFs, MEFs, fibrosarcoma cells, and HEK293T cells were stimulated for the indicated periods of time with 1–100 ng/ml LIF, 1–100 ng/ml human OSM, 20 ng/ml murine OSM, and 10 ng/ml IL-5. A 30-min preincubation with the pharmacological inhibitor AG490 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as indicated to inhibit activation of JAK2. HDFs were preincubated with LIF-05 (kindly provided by Prof. Dr. J. Heath, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) to inhibit signal transduction via the LIFR (34Vernallis A.B. Hudson K.R.

Immediately after stimulation, the cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) as described previously (25Hermanns H.M.

All of the steps of cell lysis were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 10% gels, followed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PALL, Dreieich, Germany). Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before reprobing, the blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.7) for 20 min at 70 °C.Antibodies—The phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies against STAT1(Tyr701), STAT3(Tyr705), STAT5(Tyr694), JAK1 (Tyr1022/1023), and JAK2 (Tyr1007/1008) as well as the monoclonal JAK2 antibody (24B11) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The monoclonal antibodies against STAT3 and calnexin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal IL-5Rβ (S-16), polyclonal IL-5Rβ (N-20), polyclonal α-STAT1 (E-23), polyclonal STAT5B (C-17), polyclonal SOCS3 (C-20), polyclonal IRF-1 (C-20), and monoclonal Lamin-A/C antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) were used for detection. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako (Hamburg, Germany).Peptide Precipitation Assay and Immunoblot Analysis—The amino acid sequences of the used peptides were published previously (26Stross C. Radtke S. Clahsen T. Gerlach C. Volkmer-Engert R. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Hermanns H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8458-8468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 0.003 μmol of the biotinylated peptides were immobilized by incubation with 10 μl of NeutrAvidin-coupled agarose (Pierce). For STAT5B precipitation, HEK293T cells overexpressing STAT5B were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0, supplemented with Na3VO4 (1 mm), pepstatin (3 μg/ml), leupeptin (5 μg/ml), aprotinin (5 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm)). Endogenous STAT1 and STAT3 or overexpressed STAT5B were precipitated by incubation of total cell lysates with the immobilized peptides at 4 °C overnight. Precipitates were then washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. STAT proteins were detected with antisera recognizing the proteins irrespective of their activation.Cell Fractionation—All of the fractionation and centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C using ice-cold buffers. Cytoplasmic, membrane, and nuclear fractions were prepared using protocols described in detail before (35Behrmann I. Smyczek T. Heinrich P.C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Komyod W. Giese B.

RT and PCR were performed with 1 μg of total cell RNA using a Onestep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Detection of specific mRNA for IRF-1, SOCS3, and CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2 domain-containing protein) was achieved by using primers designed to amplify at least one exon (across one intron/exon border to exclude contamination of cDNA with genomic DNA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal standard (36Stevenson N.J. Haan S. McClurg A.E. McGrattan M.J. Armstrong M.A. Heinrich P.C. Johnston J.A. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3243-3249Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out with 35 cycles of 40 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 58 °C, and 30 s of extension at 72 °C. The amplification was terminated with an extension step of 10-min duration at 72 °C after the last cycle. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.RESULTSOSM Induces Nuclear Translocation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5—Primary HDFs were stimulated for different periods of time with 20 ng/ml OSM, and subsequently plasma membrane, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions were collected to analyze the activation pattern of STATs. As expected and previously described (25Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol.

Interestingly, the STAT activation profile in the nucleus indicates that STAT5 is the most transiently activated STAT protein because no tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 could be detected in the nucleus at 60-min stimulation with OSM (Fig. 1A, top panel). In contrast, phosphorylated STAT3 can be found in the nucleus at least up to 3 h(third panel). Analyses of whole cellular extracts confirmed the prolonged activation of STAT3 for at least up to 16 h (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 1Oncostatin M-induced activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. A, HDF were stimulated with 20 ng/ml OSM for the indicated time periods, and cell fractions were prepared. Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5. Calnexin and Lamin A/C were used as markers for the membrane and nuclear fraction, respectively. B, HDFs were stimulated with indicated amounts of OSM or LIF, respectively, for 30 min. Aliquots of lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the Western blot was stained with an antiserum specific for phospho-STAT5 and restained with an antibody against STAT5. C, HDFs were incubated for 30 min with 10 μm LIF-05 before stimulation with 20 ng/ml OSM or 100 ng/ml LIF, respectively. The lysates were prepared, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dose- and Receptor-dependent STAT5 Phosphorylation—HDF express gp130, the LIFR as well as the OSMR (not shown) and therefore formation of the type I as well as the type II receptor complex in response to OSM stimulation is possible. To compare the potential of the LIFR and the OSMR to activate STAT5, we stimulated HDF with increasing concentrations of OSM and LIF. Although 1 ng of OSM/ml is sufficient to induce a clearly detectable STAT5 activation (Fig. 1B, lane 7), a concentration of >50 ng/ml LIF was necessary to activate STAT5 (lane 1). To examine whether OSM-induced STAT5 activation is preferentially mediated by LIFR or can also be initiated through the OSMR, we pretreated the cells with LIF-05, a mutated form of LIF that is still able to bind the LIFR but cannot recruit gp130 (34Vernallis A.B. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26947-26952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, the LIFR cannot be used, and signaling by OSM can only occur through the type II receptor complex (gp130/OSMR). Interestingly, the OSM-induced STAT5 phosphorylation shows no reduction (Fig. 1C, lane 4) and therefore has to be transduced via the OSMR, whereas the LIF-mediated STAT5 activation is completely absent (Fig. 1C, lane 8).The Human OSMR Uses the Double Tyrosine Motif Tyr837/Tyr839 to Activate STAT5—STAT factors can be recruited to phosphorylated tyrosine motifs within receptor chains by virtue of their SH2 domains, and specific recruitment motifs for the different STAT isoforms have been established. To analyze the capability of the tyrosine motifs within the OSMR to recruit different STATs, we took advantage of a well established chimeric receptor system (25Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar); the transmembrane and intracellular parts of the gp130 or OSMR are fused to the extracellular region of the IL-5 receptor α or β chains, respectively. By stimulating transfected cells with IL-5, we induced receptor complex formation and initiated gp130- and OSMR-mediated signal transduction. To focus on the OSMR-initiated signaling, we prevented gp130 tyrosine-based signal transduction by point mutating all five tyrosines C-terminal of box 1/2 (α/gp130YFFFFF). Using this chimeric receptor system, we can show that, as expected, STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation occurs through Tyr917/Tyr945, both of which are located within typical STAT3 consensus motifs (p)YXXQ. Mutation of Tyr917/Tyr945 within the OSMR completely abrogates STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 4) and consequently the induction of the STAT3 target gene SOCS3 on RNA and protein level (Fig. 2A, middle and bottom panel). In striking contrast, these two tyrosines are dispensable for STAT1 activation (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 4) and the induction of the classical STAT1 target gene IRF-1 as demonstrated both on RNA and protein level (Fig. 2B, middle and bottom panel). Indeed, even point mutation of all tyrosines located C-terminally of box 1/2 of the OSMR did not lead to the abrogation of STAT1 activation (Fig. 2B, top panel, lane 6). Thus, in contrast to STAT3, activation of STAT1 occurs independently of receptor tyrosine recruitment sites.FIGURE 2Definition of STAT-recruitment sites within the cytoplasmic region of the oncostatin M receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2065234680,"Receptor tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling is tightly regulated by a number of cytoplasmic signaling molecules. In this report, we show that Bcr-Abl transformed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines, K562 and Meg-01, express the receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkA, on the cell surface; however, the NGF-mediated signal is not particularly strong. Treatment with imatinib, a potent inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, downmodulates phosphorylation of downstream molecules. Upon stimulation with NGF, Erk and Akt are phosphorylated to a much greater degree in imatinib-treated cells than in untreated cells. Knockdown of expression of Bcr-Abl using small interfering RNA technique also enhanced NGF-mediated Akt phosphorylation, indicating that Bcr-Abl kinase modifies NGF signaling directly. Imatinib treatment also enhanced NGF signaling in rat adrenal pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 that expresses TrkA and c-Abl, suggesting that it is not only restoration of responsiveness to NGF after blocking oncoprotein activity, but also c-Abl tyrosine kinase per se may be a negative regulator of growth factor signaling. Furthermore, inhibition of Abl tyrosine kinase enhanced clearance of surface TrkA after NGF treatment and simultaneously enhanced NGF-mediated signaling, suggesting that as in neuronal cells 'signaling endosomes' are formed in hematopoietic cells. To examine the role of TrkA in CML cells, we studied cell growth or colony formation in the presence or absence of imatinib with or without NGF. We found that NGF treatment induces cell survival in imatinib-treated CML cell lines, as well as colony formation of primary CD34+ CML cells, strongly suggesting that NGF/TrkA signaling contributes to aberrant signaling in CML."
https://openalex.org/W2081499120,"Background Chaperones are ubiquitous conserved proteins critical in stabilization of new proteins, repair/removal of defective proteins and immunodominant antigens in innate and adaptive immunity. Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infection associated with infection by Porphyromonas gingivalis that culminates in the destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. We previously reported studies of serum antibodies reactive with the human chaperone Hsp90 in gingivitis, a reversible form of gingival disease confined to the oral soft tissues. In those studies, antibodies were at their highest levels in subjects with the best oral health. We hypothesized that antibodies to the HSP90 homologue of P. gingivalis (HtpG) might be associated with protection/resistance against destructive periodontitis. Methodology/Principal Findings ELISA assays using cloned HtpG and peptide antigens confirmed gingivitis subjects colonized with P. gingivalis had higher serum levels of anti-HtpG and, concomitantly, lower levels of attachment loss. Additionally, serum antibody levels to P. gingivalis HtpG protein were higher in healthy subjects compared to patients with either chronic or aggressive periodontitis. We found a negative association between tooth attachment loss and anti-P. gingivalis HtpG (p = 0.043) but not anti-Fusobacterium nucleatum (an oral opportunistic commensal) HtpG levels. Furthermore, response to periodontal therapy was more successful in subjects having higher levels of anti-P. gingivalis HtpG before treatment (p = 0.018). There was no similar relationship to anti-F. nucleatum HtpG levels. Similar results were obtained when these experiments were repeated with a synthetic peptide of a region of P. gingivalis HtpG. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest: 1) anti-P. gingivalis HtpG antibodies are protective and therefore predict health periodontitis-susceptable patients; 2) may augment the host defence to periodontitis and 3) a unique peptide of P. gingivalis HtpG offers significant potential as an effective diagnostic target and vaccine candidate. These results are compatible with a novel immune control mechanism unrelated to direct binding of bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1981710984,"Previous studies of learning to adapt reaching movements in the presence of novel forces show that learning multiple force fields is prone to interference. Recently it has been suggested that force field learning may reflect learning to manipulate a novel object. Within this theoretical framework, interference in force field learning may be the result of static tactile or haptic cues associated with grasp, which fail to indicate changing dynamic conditions. The idea that different haptic cues (e.g. those associated with different grasped objects) signal motor requirements and promote the learning and retention of multiple motor skills has previously been unexplored in the context of force field learning.The present study tested the possibility that interference can be reduced when two different force fields are associated with differently shaped objects grasped in the hand. Human subjects were instructed to guide a cursor to targets while grasping a robotic manipulandum, which applied two opposing velocity-dependent curl fields to the hand. For one group of subjects the manipulandum was fitted with two different handles, one for each force field. No attenuation in interference was observed in these subjects relative to controls who used the same handle for both force fields.These results suggest that in the context of the present learning paradigm, haptic cues on their own are not sufficient to reduce interference and promote learning multiple force fields."

Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The binding of GroES causes encapsulation of the substrate protein into the cavity underneath GroES (cis-cavity), where substrate protein efficiently folds into the native state (cis-folding) (12Weissman J.S.

Crystal structures (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 1AON) and mutagenesis studies indicate that the amino acid residues of GroEL responsible for binding of denatured substrate protein mostly overlap with those for binding of the GroES loop region (9Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Any mechanistic models of the GroEL/GroES reaction cycle must therefore explain how GroES binds to the cis-ring in which substrate protein already occupies the common binding sites. Although a heptameric ring of GroEL contains seven binding sites for substrate protein, Farr et al. (15Farr G.W. Furtak K. Rowland M.B. Ranson N.A. Saibil H.R. Kirchhausen T. Horwich A.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 561-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) showed that only two or three sites (but not all seven binding sites) are required to form a GroEL/substrate binary complex. A GroEL/substrate binary complex therefore still has four or five unused binding sites that are potentially available for GroES binding. One possibility is that an intermediate GroEL/substrate/GroES ternary complex could transiently form in which the substrate protein may occupy, for example, two binding sites with GroES occupying the remaining five binding sites. In this scenario, a GroES heptamer that has two binding-defective (and five binding-active) subunits would still be capable of forming the GroEL/substrate/GroES ternary complex. To address this, we generated a single polypeptide GroES composed of seven GroES subunits fused in tandem. This tandem fused GroES heptamer (t-GroES) has already been shown to possess a very similar structure to native GroES and is fully functional as a co-chaperone of GroEL (16Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Multiple t-GroES variants composed of different numbers and arrangements of the defective GroEL-binding loops among seven fused subunits were then generated and functionally characterized. The results were consistent with the notion that substrate protein and GroES are capable of sharing the seven common binding sites of the cis-ring to form the productive ternary complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagent and Proteins—Pig heart mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH) 3The abbreviations used are: MDH, malate dehydrogenase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. was purchased from Roche Applied Science, apyrase was from Nacalai Tesque, ATP and ADP were from Sigma, and 5-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester was from Invitrogen.

The extra N-terminal peptide stretch (MPGGG) included the Gly-Gly-Gly linker and an SmaI restriction site at Pro-Gly (CCCGGG). GroES C-terminal Ala and the extra Gly contained an NaeI restriction site (GCCGGC). pESC1 and pESN1 were generated by cloning the BglII-KpnI fragment of the above plasmids containing a T7 promoter and terminator into the BamHI-KpnI site of pUC19. pESC1 and pESN1 were ligated in the order required to generate various t-GroESs as described (16Sakane I.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added when the cell culture A600 reached 0.8-1.0, and cells were collected after 3 h.

The supernatant was then applied to a hydrophobic column (Butyl-650 TOYOPEARL) and eluted with a 20-0% saturated ammonium sulfate linear gradient. The fractions containing t-GroES were combined and dialyzed to 50-fold volume of 20 mm citrate-KOH, pH 4.0, and 0.1 mm DTT.

Aliquots (50 μl) were analyzed by HPLC in 0.2 mm ATP.Binding Kinetics of GroEL and t-GroESF—The solution containing t-GroESF and ATP was mixed with GroEL at 25 °C by a stopped-flow rapid mixing apparatus (SFM-400, BioLogic) equipped with a fluorometer. Final concentrations of t-GroESF and ATP were 10 nm and 1 mm, respectively. GroEL concentrations were varied (100, 150, 200, and 300 nm). The excitation wavelength was 475 nm. Emission was filtered by a long wave (480 nm) pass filter and a short wave (520 nm) pass filter. The same experiments were repeated at least five times, and the data were averaged.Folding Assay—Unless otherwise stated, all procedures and assays were carried out at 23 °C. For the rhodanese folding assay, the solution containing 0.5 μm rhodanese and 1.0 μm GroEL or SR1D398A in buffer A was incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. This heat-treated solution was mixed with an equal volume of buffer A containing 4 μm GroES, 40 mm Na2S2O3, and 2 mm DTT. In the case of SR1D398A, “trap-GroEL” (GroELN265A/D398A (17Motojima F.

The folding reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP (final concentration, 4 mm). Recovery of rhodanese activity following a 1-h incubation was measured as described previously (23Koike-Takeshita A. Shimamura T. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 962-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For the MDH folding assay, the solution containing 0.5 μm MDH, 1.0 μm GroEL or SR1D398A and 5 mm DTT in buffer A was incubated at 60 °C for 15 min. In the case of SR1D398A, trap-GroEL was then added. GroES was added to a final concentration 4 μm, and ATP (final concentration, 4 mm) was added to initiate folding. After a 1-h incubation, recovery of MDH activity was measured as described previously (23Koike-Takeshita A. Shimamura T. Yokoyama K. Yoshida M. Taguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 962-967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of SR1D398A, GroES was detached from SR1D398A to allow dimerization of folded monomer MDH by the following procedure; ATP was eliminated by apyrase (1 unit/ml for >10 min), methanol was added (5% v/v), and the solution was treated with two cycles of freeze-thawing. This procedure allowed 95% of GroES to be detached from SR1D398A (data not shown). For the GFP folding assay, an acid-denatured GFP solution (15 μm) was diluted 300-fold in buffer A containing 5 mm DTT, 150 nm SR1D398A, and 2 μm GroES. After 10 min, trap-GroEL was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. 1 mm ATP was then added to initiate folding. GFP fluorescence intensity was monitored continuously with a fluorometer (excitation 485 nm/emission 512 nm, FP-6500, Jasco).RESULTSCovalent Linkage of GroES Subunits—The N and C termini of neighboring GroES subunits in the native GroES heptamer are located close to one another (average of seven pairs, 4.5Å (Cα-Cα)) (Fig. 1). By linking them with a Gly-Gly-Gly linker, seven members of the heptamer were fused into a single polypeptide. As shown previously (16Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in this report, t-GroES was fully functional in vitro as compared with the native GroES. A set of triple mutations (I25S, V26S, and L27S) were then introduced in various numbers and arrangements among the seven subunits in t-GroES. These substituted hydrophobic residues in the GroES mobile loop were shown to be in contact with the GroEL apical domain H and I helices in the crystal structure of GroEL-GroES-ADP complex (PDB number 1AON) (24Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar); in the current study, the mutations described above were confirmed to result in complete loss of the ability of GroES to bind GroEL (data not shown). In the interest of simplicity, t-GroES containing e.g. two defective subunits at the first and second positions from N terminus was referred to as t-GroES(2d:1,2). Irrespective of the positions, the t-GroESs containing two binding-defective subunits were collectively referred to as t-GroES(2d). The t-GroES composed of intact (binding-active) GroES subunits alone was referred to as wild-type t-GroES. It was already shown that the wild-type t-GroES has overall structural similarity to GroES and reduces ATPase activity of GroEL in the same manner as native GroES (16Sakane I. Hongo K. Motojima F. Murayama S. Mizobata T. Kawata Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1171-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Binding of t-GroESF to GroEL—The ability of t-GroES to bind GroEL in the presence of ADP was examined (Fig. 2A). It is known that ADP supports the binding of GroES to GroEL (but not to GroEL/substrate binary complex). To detect the formation of the complex, a fluorescently labeled t-GroESF was mixed with 2-fold molar excess GroEL in the presence of ADP and subjected to gel filtration HPLC monitored by fluorescence in the presence of ADP. Wild-type t-GroESF co-eluted with GroEL, indicating its stable binding to GroEL. t-GroESF(1d;1) also showed stable binding. We confirmed that the positional effect of GroESF(1d) was not significant because t-GroESF(1d;4) and t-GroESF(1d;7) formed a stable complex with GroEL (data not shown). t-GroESF(2d) also formed a complex with GroEL even if a trace fraction of free t-GroESF(2d) appeared. t-GroESF(2d;1,2), t-GroESF(2d;1,3), and t-GroESF(2d;1,4) showed the similar elution pattern. When the number of the defective subunits increased to three, only a trace amount of GroEL/t-GroESF(3d) complex was detected. When more than four defective subunits existed in t-GroESF, no complex with GroEL was detected. The same experiments were carried out in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2B). To prevent multiple turnover, a very slow (<2% of the wild-type GroEL) ATP-hydrolyzing GroEL variant, GroELD398A, was used (20Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The results were very similar to those of Fig. 2A, and t-GroESF(1d) and t-GroESF(2d) formed a stable complex with GroELD398A. t-GroESF(3d) formed the complex with GroELD398A in a manner that was found to be dependent on the arrangement of the defective subunits in the t-GroESF. The apparent order of the yield of the complex formation was t-GroESF(3d;1,2,3)→t-GroESF(3d;1,3,4)→t-GroESF(3d;1,4,6)→t-GroESF(3d;1,2,5). The numbers of the longest consecutive active subunits in these t-GroES(3d)F values were 4, 3, 2, and 2, respectively, and it appeared that the yield of the complex formation decreased as the number of consecutive active subunits decreased. This may reflect a cooperative adjustment of GroEL conformation for GroES binding triggered by initial binding of a GroES subunit that is sequentially transmitted to a neighboring GroEL subunit. In general, yields of the complexes with t-GroESF(3d) were better in ATP than in ADP (Fig. 2, A and B). This probably reflects the assumption that the GroEL/GroES complex is more stable in its ATP form than in its ADP form. Both complexes were too stable (half-decay time is several weeks (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) to measure accurately, but the difference became visible by using t-GroESF(3d). In summary, at least four active subunits in a GroES heptamer are required to form GroEL/GroES complex that is stable during gel filtration.FIGURE 2Binding of t-GroESF to GroEL. Binding of t-GroESF to GroEL in the presence of ADP (A) or ATP (B) was measured. To prevent catalytic turnover, GroELD398A was used in B. t-GroESF and GroEL were mixed at a 1:2 molar ratio in the presence of 1 mm ADP (A) or ATP (B) and were applied to gel filtration HPLC equilibrated with 0.2 mm ADP (A) or ATP (B). Elution was monitored by fluorescence of t-GroESF. GroEL/t-GroESF complexes and free t-GroESF were eluted at 12 and 17 min, respectively. Each elution pattern was normalized so that the total peak area became equal among elutions. Detailed experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Circles with seven mini-circles illustrate the t-GroESF variants, and white and black minicircles indicate subunits with active and defective GroEL-binding loops, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of t-GroESF to the SR1D398A/Substrate Binary Complex—The binding of t-GroESF to the SR1D398A/substrate binary complex was then analyzed. A single ring version of GroEL (SR1) (12Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) with slow ATP-hydrolyzing mutation (SR1D398A) was used to avoid the complication caused by the presence of the trans-ring (the ring opposite to cis-ring) and from multiple turnover of the reaction. Under standard experimental conditions, SR1D398A does not dissociate GroES and therefore does not release the encapsulated protein, whether folded or not, from the cavity into the medium. SR1D398A/MDH and SR1D398A/rhodanese binary complexes were prepared by heat treatment of MDH and rhodanese in the presence of SR1D398A. The binary complexes were mixed with t-GroESF, and complex formation was examined by gel filtration HPLC (Fig. 3, A and B). Wild-type t-GroESF, as well as t-GroESF(1d;1), was co-eluted with SR1D398A. t-GroESF(2d) formed the ternary complex, but the yields differed between substrate proteins; t-GroESF(2d) mostly bound to the GroEL/MDH binary complex, but binding to the GroEL/rhodanese binary complex was relatively poor. The positional effect of defective subunits was small since t-GroESF(2d;1,2), t-GroESF(2d;1,3), and t-GroESF(2d;1,4) showed similar elution patterns. As the number of defective subunits in the t-GroESF increased to more than three, t-GroESF did not form a stable ternary complex except for t-GroESF(3d;1,2,3), which formed the ternary complex with MDH, albeit at a moderate yield.FIGURE 3Binding of t-GroESF to SR1D398A/substrate binary complexes. Binding of t-GroESF to the SR1D398A/rhodanese binary complex (A) or to the SR1D398A/MDH binary complex (B) in the presence of ATP was examined. SR1D398A/substrate binary complex was generated by heat treatment. Other conditions were the same as those described in the legend for Fig. 2. The SR1D398A/substrate/t-GroESF ternary complex and free t-GroESF were eluted at 13 and 17 min, respectively. C, the ternary complex isolated from the first HPLC was reapplied to the same gel filtration HPLC under the same conditions to determine the stability of the complex. D, the SR1D398A/MDH/t-GroESF(3d;1,2,3) ternary complex isolated from the first HPLC was applied to the second HPLC. E, as a control, SR1D398A/t-GroESF(3d;1,2,3) complex isolated from the first HPLC was applied to the second HPLC. White and black minicircles indicate active and defective GroES subunit, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Stability of the Ternary Complex—To know the stability of the ternary complex, the peak fraction of the SR1D398A/rhodanese/t-GroESF ternary complex in the first HPLC was isolated and then applied to the second (same) HPLC (Fig. 3C). Ternary complexes made from wild-type t-GroESF, t-GroESF(1d;1), t-GroESF(2d;1,2), t-GroESF(2d;1,3), and t-GroESF(2d;1,4), were all recovered as the ternary complex without significant GroES dissociation. This fraction was then checked to confirm that rhodanese was still present (data not shown). Thus, even if the yield in the first HPLC was low in the case of GroESF(2d), the ternary complex was stable once formed. As shown later, these t-GroESs were able to mediate productive folding, and substrate proteins would already finish folding in the cis-cavity in these complexes. This was not the case when the number of defective subunits increased to three; SR1D398A/MDH/t-GroESF(3d;1,2,3) ternary complex decayed in the second HPLC (Fig. 3D). Also, SR1D398A/t-GroESF(3d; 1,2,3) complex without substrate protein isolated in the first HPLC decayed in the second HPLC (Fig. 3E). The results of gel filtration HPLC suggest that at least five active GroES subunits in a GroES heptamer are required to generate stable GroEL/substrate/GroES ternary complex.Binding Kinetics—The kinetics of t-GroESF binding to GroEL were measured with a rapid mixing apparatus. Binding was monitored by the fluorescence intensity of t-GroESF that decreased upon association to GroEL. The time course of the fluorescence change was well fitted by a single exponential curve (supplemental Fig. S1), and the binding rate constant (kon) was calculated (Table 1). The kon value of wild-type t-GroESF, 8.29 × 107 m-1 s-1, was similar to the value of native GroES: 7.5 × 107 m-1 s-1 (21Motojima F. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26648-26654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), 5 × 107 m-1 s-1 (25Rye H.S. Roseman A.M. Chen S. Furtak K. Fenton W.A. Saibil H.R. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1999; 97: 325-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and 4 × 107 m-1 s-1 (26Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As the number of defective subunits in t-GroESF increased, kon values decreased. However, the decrement was small, and the kon values of all t-GroESFs with 4-7 active subunits remained in the same order of magnitude, 107 m-1 s-1. Thus, the binding rates of t-GroESF to GroEL appeared to be less sensitive to the presence of binding-defective subunits than the yield of the complex formation tested with gel filtration. The dissociation rate constants (koff) might be responsible for decreasing the stability of t-GroESF containing defective subunits.TABLE 1Binding rate constants (kon) of t-GroESF to GroELView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Co-chaperone Activity of the t-GroES—In the chaperonin reaction cycle, binding of GroES to the GroEL/substrate binary complex induces the encapsulation of substrate protein into the cis-cavity where folding follows. The co-chaperone activity of t-GroES on the folding of MDH and rhodanese was then tested. It is known that the folding of both of these proteins is dependent on both GroES and GroEL. To test the folding in the cis-cavity by a single turnover reaction, SR1D398A was used, and the binary complex with substrate protein was generated by heat treatment. Trap-GroEL (GroELN265A/D398A) was included to trap any free unfolded substrate proteins escaping from the cis-cavity. ATP was added to initiate the reaction in the presence of t-GroES, and the recovery yield of the enzyme activity was measured after the completion of folding (Fig. 4A). In the case of MDH, GroES was detached from SR1D398A by freezethawing to allow folded MDH monomer to form enzyme-active dimer. The results of MDH and rhodanese were very similar to each other. As compared with native GroES, wild-type t-GroES and t-GroES(1d;1) attained similar and slightly lower folding yields, respectively. GroES(2d)s showed diminished, but still significant, folding yields. GroES(3d)s had only marginal, if any, co-chaperone activity as compared with a (-GroES) control. Folding by multiple turnover of wild-type GroEL and t-GroES was also measured (Fig. 4B). In this experiment, trap-GroEL was not added to allow unfolded proteins to bind GroEL repeatedly. The results were again very similar between MDH and rhodanese but, as expected, folding yields attained by"
https://openalex.org/W2019385929,"Background Departures from power law group size frequency distributions have been proposed as a useful tool to link individual behavior with population patterns and dynamics, although examples are scarce for wild animal populations. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied a population of Lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni) breeding in groups (colonies) from one to ca. 40 breeding pairs in 10,000 km2 in NE Spain. A 3.5 fold steady population increase occurred during the eight-year study period, accompanied by a geographical expansion from an initial subpopulation which in turn remained stable in numbers. This population instability was mainly driven by first-breeders, which are less competitive at breeding sites, being relegated to breed solitarily or in small colony sizes, and disperse farther than adults. Colony size frequency distributions shifted from an initial power law to a truncated power law mirroring population increase. Thus, we hypothesized that population instability was behind the truncation of the power law. Accordingly, we found a power law distribution through years in the initial subpopulation, and a match between the power law breakpoint (at ca. ten pairs) and those colony sizes from which the despotic behavior of colony owners started to impair the settlement of newcomers. Moreover, the instability hypothesis was further supported by snapshot data from another population of Lesser kestrels in SW Spain suffering a population decline. Conclusions/Significance Appropriate analysis of the scaling properties of grouping patterns has unraveled the link between local agonistic processes and large-scale (population) grouping patterns in a wild bird population."
https://openalex.org/W2051945248,Eberwine(-like) amplification of mRNA adds distinct 6-10 bp nucleotide stretches to the 5' end of amplified RNA transcripts. Analysis of over six thousand microarrays reveals that probes containing motifs complementary to these stretches are associated with aberrantly high signals up to a hundred fold the signal observed in unaffected probes. This is not observed when total RNA is used as target source. Different T7 primer sequences are used in different laboratories and platforms and consequently different T7 primer bias is observed in different datasets. This will hamper efforts to compare data sets across platforms.
https://openalex.org/W2103885246,"Background Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is auto-regulated to meet the brain's metabolic requirements. Oxycyte® is a perfluorocarbon emulsion that acts as a highly effective oxygen carrier compared to blood. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of Oxycyte® on regional CBF (rCBF), by evaluating the effects of stepwise isovolemic hemodilution with Oxycyte® on CBF. Methodology Male rats were intubated and ventilated with 100% O2 under isoflurane anesthesia. The regional (striatum) CBF (rCBF) was measured with a laser doppler flowmeter (LDF). Stepwise isovolemic hemodilution was performed by withdrawing 4ml of blood and substituting the same volume of 5% albumin or 2 ml Oxycyte® plus 2 ml albumin at 20-minute intervals until the hematocrit (Hct) values reached 5%. Principal Findings In the albumin-treated group, rCBF progressively increased to approximately twice its baseline level (208±30%) when Hct levels were less than 10%. In the Oxycyte®-treated group on the other hand, rCBF increased by significantly smaller increments, and this group's mean rCBF was only slightly higher than baseline (118±18%) when Hct levels were less than 10%. Similarly, in the albumin-treated group, rCBF started to increase when hemodilution with albumin caused the CaO2 to decrease below 17.5 ml/dl. Thereafter, the increase in rCBF was accompanied by a nearly proportional decrease in the CaO2 level. In the Oxycyte®-treated group, the increase in rCBF was significantly smaller than in the albumin-treated group when the CaO2 level dropped below 10 ml/dl (142±20% vs. 186±26%), and rCBF returned to almost baseline levels (106±15) when the CaO2 level was below 7 ml/dl. Conclusions/Significance Hemodilution with Oxycyte® was accompanied with higher CaO2 and PO2 than control group treated with albumin alone. This effect may be partially responsible for maintaining relatively constant CBF and not allowing the elevated blood flow that was observed with albumin."
https://openalex.org/W2066412524,"Vapor diffusion is the most widely used technique for protein crystallization and the rate of water evaporation plays a key role on the quality of the crystals. Attempts have been made in the past to solve the mass transfer problem governing the evaporation process, either analytically or by employing numerical methods. Despite these efforts, the methods used for protein crystallization remain based on trial and error techniques rather than on fundamental principles.Here we present a new theoretical model which describes the hanging drop method as a function of the different variables that are known to influence the evaporation process. The model is extensively tested against experimental data published by other authors and considering different crystallizing conditions. Aspects responsible for the discrepancies between the existing theories and the measured evaporation kinetics are especially discussed; they include the characterization of vapor-liquid equilibrium, the role of mass transfer within the evaporating droplet, and the influence of the droplet-reservoir distance.The validation tests show that the proposed model can be used to predict the water evaporation rates under a wide range of experimental conditions used in the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method, with no parameter fitting or computational requirements. This model combined with protein solubility data is expected to become a useful tool for a priori screening of crystallization conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2168749798,"The effects of the inactivating peptide from the eukaryotic Shaker BK+ channel (the ShB peptide) on the prokaryotic KcsA channel have been studied using patch clamp methods. The data show that the peptide induces rapid, N-type inactivation in KcsA through a process that includes functional uncoupling of channel gating. We have also employed saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR methods to map the molecular interactions between the inactivating peptide and its channel target. The results indicate that binding of the ShB peptide to KcsA involves the ortho and meta protons of Tyr8, which exhibit the strongest STD effects; the C4H in the imidazole ring of His16; the methyl protons of Val4, Leu7, and Leu10 and the side chain amine protons of one, if not both, the Lys18 and Lys19 residues. When a noninactivating ShB-L7E mutant is used in the studies, binding to KcsA is still observed but involves different amino acids. Thus, the strongest STD effects are now seen on the methyl protons of Val4 and Leu10, whereas His16 seems similarly affected as before. Conversely, STD effects on Tyr8 are strongly diminished, and those on Lys18 and/or Lys19 are abolished. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of KcsA in presence of 13C-labeled peptide derivatives suggests that the ShB peptide, but not the ShB-L7E mutant, adopts a β-hairpin structure when bound to the KcsA channel. Indeed, docking such a β-hairpin structure into an open pore model for K+ channels to simulate the inactivating peptide/channel complex predicts interactions well in agreement with the experimental observations.

Inactivation of ion channels limits the duration of channel openings and is essential in shaping and regulating cellular excitability. Early studies on N-type inactivation in voltage-dependent Na+ or K+ channels envisioned this process as a consequence of the occlusion of the channel mouth by a flexible cytoplasmic domain, located either at the N-terminal end of the channel protein or at an associated β subunit, which acts as an open channel blocker. This proposal, known as the “ball and chain” hypothesis of channel inactivation (1Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), received plenty of experimental support, and indeed, several “ball” peptides have been identified in different channels. In the Shaker BK+ channel, the inactivating ball peptide (the ShB peptide) corresponds to the first 20 amino acids of each of the subunits forming the tetrameric channel (MAAVAGLYGLGEDRQHRKKQ) (2Hoshi T.

From such observations it was concluded that channel inactivation has a rather unconstrained basis in terms of primary structure and also that there must be two domains, complementary to those in the ball peptides, configuring the site for the inactivating peptide in the channel protein: (i) a hydrophobic pocket accessible only upon channel opening and separated from the cytoplasm by (ii) a region with a negative surface potential (3Catterall W.A.

Nonetheless, no crystallographic data are yet available on a channel-ball peptide complex, and therefore, issues such as the identity of the peptide-binding site within the channel protein or the conformation adopted by the channel-bound inactivation peptide must await future studies. In the absence of such information, different electrophysiological studies (13Zhou M. Morais-Cabral J.H. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 411: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 16Murrell-Lagnado R.D. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 949-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) suggest that the inactivating ball peptide snakes into the cytoplasmic channel mouth and stays there during inactivation in an almost linear, extended conformation. On the other hand, the conformational propensity of both the ball peptide of the Kv 3.4 channel (17Antz C. Geyer M. Fakler B. Schott M.K. Guy H.R. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C535-C556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contain a hydrophobic domain (the acyl chains in the lipid bilayer), separated from the aqueous media by the negatively charged vesicle surface. These studies show that ball peptides are poorly structured in solution but adopt a β-structure when challenged by the channel-mimicking model target (19Fernandez-Ballester G. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P.

Such β-structure has been identified as a β-hairpin that readily inserts into the hydrophobic domains provided by the lipid bilayer model target (20Encinar J.A. Fernandez A.M. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P.

Here we first demonstrate the occurrence of N-type inactivation mediated by the ShB peptide in KcsA, a prokaryotic potassium channel from Streptomyces lividans (25Schrempf H. Schmidt O. Kummerlen R. Hinnah S. Muller D. Betzler M. Steinkamp T. Wagner R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Interestingly, KcsA inactivation is associated to functional uncoupling of channels that exhibited positively coupled gating prior to the addition of the ShB peptide (26Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernandez A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18837-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Also, saturation transfer difference (STD) 5The abbreviations used are: STD, saturation transfer difference; DDM, dodecyl β-d-maltoside; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. NMR methods (27Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Int. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 28Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 1999; 121: 5336-5337Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have been used to identify interactions at atomic resolution in the KcsA-ShB complex. STD spectra are obtained after selective saturation of resonances of the KcsA protein, whereby the magnetization redistributes within the protein via intramolecular spin diffusion. Then, if a bound ligand is present, magnetization transfers from the protein to the ligand via 1H-1H dipolar contacts. An efficient intermolecular magnetization transfer from protons of the protein to the ligand requires very short distances, and therefore, ligand binding is strictly required for the transfer phenomenon. Our results demonstrate that indeed the wild-type ShB peptide binds to KcsA and also distinguish which amino acid residues are involved in binding. Finally, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using 13C-labeled ShB peptide supports the notion that the inactivating ShB peptide adopts a β-hairpin structure when channel-bound. Moreover, docking such a β-hairpin into the open channel conformation of KcsA modeled after MthK (14Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), a prokaryotic channel taken as a model for open K+ channels, predicts interactions that are well in agreement with those determined in the STD-NMR experiments. Peptide Synthesis and Characterization—The wild-type ShB and the mutant ShB-L7E peptides were synthesized as C-terminal amidated peptides in an automatic multiple synthesizer (AMS 422, Abimed, Lanfengeld, Germany) by using a solid phase procedure and standard Fmoc chemistry (19Fernandez-Ballester G. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Criado M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 858-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The peptides were also acetylated at their N termini. The peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC to better than 95% purity, and their composition and molecular mass were confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry (19Fernandez-Ballester G. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Criado M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 858-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The residual trifluoroacetic acid used in peptide synthesis and HPLC purification was removed by repeated lyophilization-solubilization in 10 mm HCl. For the synthesis of the 13C-labeled ShB and ShB-L7E peptide analogs, l-alanine-N-Fmoc (1-13C, 99%) and l-leucine-N-Fmoc (1-13C, 99%) (from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) were used, instead of the regular l-alanine and l-leucine reagents, under otherwise identical experimental procedures. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression of the wild-type KcsA protein with an added N-terminal hexahistidine tag in Escherichia coli M15 (pRep4) cells and its purification by affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column was carried out as reported (30Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The final buffer used with the purified protein was 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, containing 100 mm KCl and 1 mm DDM. 1–125 KcsA was prepared by chymotrypsin hydrolysis of wild-type KcsA and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tryptic-peptide mass fingerprinting (30Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N. Fernandez-Ballester G. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14924-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of KcsA into Asolectin Lipid Vesicles—Large unilamellar vesicles of asolectin (soybean lipids, type II-S; Sigma) were prepared at 25 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl (reconstitution buffer) and stored in liquid N2 (31Riquelme G. Lopez E. Garcia-Segura L.M. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11215-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The purified, DDM-solubilized KcsA protein was mixed with the above asolectin vesicles previously resolubilized in 3 mm DDM at a lipid:protein subunit molar ratio of 500:1, for 2 h. Reconstituted liposomes were formed by removing the detergent by gel filtration on Sephadex G-50 (fine, 15–20-ml bed volume) previously swollen overnight in buffer without detergent. The detergent-solubilized lipid/protein mixture (2 ml) was loaded on top of the column, and the reconstituted liposomes were eluted in the void volume. The protein-containing reconstituted fractions were pooled and centrifuged for 30 min at 300,000 × g. The pellet was suspended into reconstitution buffer to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml, divided into 50-μg aliquots, and stored in liquid N2 (30Molina M.L. Encinar J.A. Barrera F.N.

Electrophysiological Recordings in Reconstituted Giant Liposomes—Multilamellar giant liposomes (up to 50–100 μm in diameter) were prepared by submitting a mixture of the reconstituted vesicles from above (usually containing 50 μg of KcsA protein) and asolectin lipid vesicles (25 mg of total lipids) to a cycle of partial dehydration/rehydration (26Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernandez A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11215-11222Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Standard inside-out patch clamp recordings (32Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15172) Google Scholar) were carried out on excised patches from giant liposomes containing the wild-type KcsA, as reported previously (26Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernandez A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18837-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recordings were obtained using either an Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments) or an EPC-9 (Heka Electronic, Lambrecht/Pfalzt, Germany) patch clamp amplifier, at a gain of 50 mV/pA. The holding potential was applied to the interior of the patch pipette, and the bath was maintained at virtual ground (V = Vbath - Vpipette). The recordings were filtered at 1 kHz, and the data were analyzed with the Clampfit-9 software (Axon Instruments). An Ag-AgCl wire was used as the reference electrode through an agar bridge. All of the measurements were made at room temperature. The pipette (extracellular) solution contained 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, and the bath (intracellular) solution contained 10 mm MES buffer, pH 4, 100 mm KCl. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H NMR experiments were recorded at 283 K on a Avance Bruker DRX-500 using a z axis gradient by using BBO or TXI probeheads. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in the phase sensitive mode by using the States time proportional phase incrementation method (33States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). All of the experiments were carried out using the WATERGATE pulse sequence for water suppression (34Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3536) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H-1H total correlation spectra were recorded by using a MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence (35Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with a mixing time of 80 ms. NOE spectroscopy experiments were recorded with mixing times of 100 and 250 ms. Typically, spectra were acquired with 512 t1 increments, 2048 data points, and a relaxation delay of 1 s. The spectral width was 6000 Hz in all cases. The spectra were processed using the BRUKER-XWIN-NMR software working on a PC work station. All of the spectra were zero-filled in the F1 spectral dimension to 1024 data points, and a squared sine bell window function was applied in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. Sequential assignments of proton resonances of ShB and ShB-L7E peptides were based on characteristic sequential NOE connectivities between the Hα of a particular residue, and the amide proton of the next residue in the NOE spectra was referred to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic acid-2,2,3,3-2H4-sodium salt. In the STD experiments, 2 mg of freeze-dried peptide were dissolved in 500 μl of buffer (50 mm d4-acetic acid, 100 mm KCl, 10% D2O), containing KcsA either reconstituted in asolectin vesicles or solubilized in 5 mm of the detergent DDM. Deuterated acetic acid and its sodium salt were purchased from Sigma. Peptide and KcsA final concentrations were 2 mm and 45 μm, respectively. The one-dimensional 1H STD NMR (27Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Int. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 28Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 29Klein J. Meinekee R. Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5336-5337Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar) spectra of ShB or ShB-L7E peptides-KcsA complexes were recorded with usually 4000 scans. Selective saturation of protein resonances was set at -3 ppm (on resonance). Control experiments at this frequency showed that the entire protein (either in reconstituted lipid vesicles or solubilized in DDM micelles) can be saturated uniformly and then efficiently used for the STD NMR technique. In this region, the methyl resonances of the protein appear, and irradiation at protein methyl groups has previously been found to yield the most effective saturation (36Yan J. Kline A.D. Mo H. Shapiro M.J. Zartler E.R. J. Magn Reson. 2003; 163: 270-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); furthermore, this frequency is far away from the most up-field shifted methyl protons of the peptides (see Ref. 22Schott M.K. Antz C. Frank R. Ruppersberg J.P. Kalbitzer H.R. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar and our own observations), such that no perturbation of this signal can be induced by the selectively shaped pulse. Investigation of the time dependence of the saturation transfer with saturation times ranging from 0.2 to 2.5 s showed that 1.5 s were needed for efficient transfer saturation from the protein to the ligand protons. STD NMR spectra were acquired using a series of equally spaced 50-ms Gaussian-shaped pulses for selective saturation. The radio frequency field strength of the Gaussian-shaped pulses was ∼100 Hz, with a 1-ms delay between the pulses. Residual water signal was eliminated by using excitation sculpting procedures (37Prost E. Sizun P. Piotto M. Nuzillard J.M. J. Magn Reson. 2002; 159: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A spin-lock sequence was applied before the excitation sculpting sequence to remove the signals of KcsA (27Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Int. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 38Meyer B. Peters T. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 864-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The reference STD spectra were recorded with the off resonance set at 30 ppm. The saturated spectra were subtracted from the reference spectra via phase cycling. Experiments with ShB-L7E peptide were only carried out with KcsA reconstituted in asolectin vesicles. To ensure that the observed signals arose from the STD effect, the following controls were carried out. STD-NMR experiments with the on and off resonance frequencies set either at -3 and 30 ppm, respectively, were acquired with samples containing the ShB peptide in the absence of KcsA, either in plain aqueous buffer or in the presence of DDM; the saturation time was 2 s. No signals were present in the difference spectra, indicating that the effects observed in the presence of KcsA were due to true saturation transfer. In addition, we recorded control experiments in a sample of DDM micelles with on and off saturation frequencies set to identical values (either at -3 or 30 ppm). The difference spectra did not contain any signals, proving that good subtraction was achieved. To allow for comparison among the different signals in the STD experiments, the signal intensities of the different protons were analyzed by the use of the fractional STD amplification factor, which expresses the signal intensity in the STD spectrum, I0 - Isat, as a fraction of an unsaturated reference spectrum, I0, and the excess of added ligand (28Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). STD amplification factor=(I0−Isat)I0×[ligand excess](Eq. 1) The errors in the STD amplification factor were estimated from the determination of the STD effects measured in two identical samples at 1.5 s and processed simultaneously. The differences obtained were lower than 10% for all the measured resonances. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—Lyophilized aliquots of synthetic peptides, with or without the desired lipid vesicles, were processed in D2O buffer as reported earlier (20Encinar J.A. Fernandez A.M. Gavilanes F. Albar J.P. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). For the samples containing detergent-solubilized KcsA, both in the presence and in the absence of added ShB or ShB-L7E peptides, aliquots of KcsA in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm DDM were processes as described earlier (39Encinar J.A. Molina M.L. Poveda J.A. Barrera F.N. Renart M.L. Fernandez A.M. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), except that 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DDM was used for the washings. Routinely, amide I′ bands in these experiments were 0.4 absorbance units or larger. For spectral acquisition, the aliquots of 20 μl of each sample were placed between a pair of CaF2 windows separated by a 50-μm-thick mylar spacers and mounted in a Harrick (Ossining, NY) demountable cell. Temperature (∼22 °C) was maintained constant with a circulating water bath. The spectra were recorded on a Bruker IF66s instrument equipped with a DTGS detector, and the sample chamber was continuously purged with dry air. A minimum of 600 scans/spectra were taken, averaged, apodized with a Happ-Genzel function, and Fourier-transformed to give a nominal resolution of 2 cm-1 (40Fernandez-Ballester G. Castresana J. Arrondo J.L. Ferragut J.A. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Three spectra were recorded for each sample, and the buffer contribution was subtracted. Derivation was performed using a power of 3 and a breakpoint of 0.3. Self-deconvolution was performed using a Lorenztian bandwidth of 18 cm-1 and a resolution enhancement factor of 2.0 (39Encinar J.A. Molina M.L. Poveda J.A. Barrera F.N. Renart M.L. Fernandez A.M. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5199-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Modeling the ShB-KcsA Complex—The modeling of KcsA in the open conformation was done by homology, using the crystal structure at 3.3 Å resolution of the calcium-gated potassium channel MthK as a template (Protein Data Bank code 1LNQ). The multiple sequence alignment was made with CLUSTALW at the European Bioinformatics Institute site and manually supervised (final 24% identity and 40% similarity). The homology modeling was performed in the Swiss-Model Protein Modeling Server at the ExPASy Molecular Biology site. For model refinements, the orientation and optimization of the side chains was carried out in two steps. First, those residues making van der Waals' clashes were selected and fitted with “Quick and Dirty” algorithms; second, models were energy minimized (100 steps of steepest descent and 100 conjugate gradient, cut-off of 10 Å for nonbonded interactions) with Insight II (Biosym/MSI, Accelrys Software Inc.). Structure editions were made with Swiss Protein Data Bank viewer v3.7 (41Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9636) Google Scholar). The protein-protein docking interaction prediction was accomplished with GRAMM-X v.1.2.0 (42Tovchigrechko A. Vakser I.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) using default conditions. The protein complex was tested in terms of energy with FoldX (43Guerois R. Nielsen J.E.

The molecular graphic representations were created with PyMOL. The Inactivating ShB Peptide Uncouples and Inactivates KcsA—The prokaryotic potassium channel KcsA behaves in many respects similarly to its structurally more complex eukaryotic counterparts (46LeMasurier M.
