https://openalex.org/W4292219767,"Organisms use energy to grow and reproduce, so the processes of energy metabolism and biological production should be tightly bound. On the basis of this tenet, we developed and tested a new theory that predicts the relationships among three fundamental aspects of life: metabolic rate, growth, and reproduction. We show that the optimization of these processes yields the observed allometries of metazoan life, particularly metabolic scaling. We conclude that metabolism, growth, and reproduction are inextricably linked; that together they determine fitness; and, in contrast to longstanding dogma, that no single component drives another. Our model predicts that anthropogenic change will cause animals to evolve decreased scaling exponents of metabolism, increased growth rates, and reduced lifetime reproductive outputs, with worrying consequences for the replenishment of future populations."

To leverage the computational power of these walks, it is important to be able to programmably modify the graph a walker traverses while maintaining coherence. We do this by combining the fast, programmable control provided by optical tweezers with the scalable, homogeneous environment of an optical lattice. With these tools we study continuous-time quantum walks of single atoms on a square lattice and perform proof-of-principle demonstrations of spatial search with these walks. When scaled to more particles, the capabilities demonstrated can be extended to study a variety of problems in quantum information science, including performing more effective versions of spatial search using a larger graph with increased connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4292219917,"Equine recurrent uveitis (ERU) is a spontaneous, painful, and vision threatening disease affecting up to 25% of equine populations worldwide. Current treatments of ERU are non-specific and have many side effects which limits them to short-term use. In order to develop an effective therapy for ERU, we investigated the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy, exploiting a natural immune tolerance mechanism induced by equine interleukin-10 (Equine-IL10). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a single intravitreal (IVT) dose of AAV8-Equine-IL10 gene therapy for inhibition of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) in rats. Each rat was dosed intravitreally (IVT) in both eyes with either balanced salt solution (BSS) (control; n = 4), AAV8-Equine-IL10 at a low dose (2.4x10 9 vg; n = 5) or high dose (2.4x10 10 vg; n = 5). EAU was induced in all groups of rats 7 days after IVT injections and euthanized 21 days post-injection. Ophthalmic examination and aqueous humor (AH) cell counts were recorded with the observer blinded to the treatment groups. Histopathology and qPCR were performed on selected ocular tissues. Data presented herein demonstrate that AAV8-Equine-IL10 treated rats exhibited a significant decrease in clinical inflammatory scores and AH cell counts compared to BSS-treated EAU eyes on days 10, 12 and 14 post EAU induction at both administered vector doses. Mean cellular histologic infiltrative scores were also significantly less in AAV8-Equine-IL10 dosed rats compared to the BSS group. Intravitreal injection of AAV8-Equine-IL10 resulted in Equine-IL10 cDNA expression in the ciliary body, retina, cornea, and optic nerve in a dose-dependent manner. A single IVT injection of AAV8-Equine-IL10 appeared to be well-tolerated and inhibited EAU even at the lowest administered dose. These results demonstrate safety and efficacy of AAV8-Equine-IL10 to prevent EAU and support continued exploration of AAV gene therapy for the treatment of equine and perhaps human recurrent uveitis."
https://openalex.org/W4292220044,"In 2017, the Myanmar National Action Plan for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) (2017–2022) was endorsed by the Ministry of Health and Sports, Myanmar; one of its objectives was to increase public awareness of AMR to accelerate appropriate antibiotic use. This survey aimed to assess the public knowledge, practices and awareness concerning antibiotics and AMR awareness among adults in Myanmar. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional mobile phone panel survey in January and February 2020. Participants were randomly selected from the mobile phone panel in each of three groups stratified by gender, age group, and residential area urbanity; they were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Collected data were weighted based on the population of each stratum from the latest national census and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Two thousand and forty-five adults from 12 regions and states participated in this survey. Overall, 89.5% of participants had heard about antibiotics; however, only 0.9% provided correct answers to all five questions about antibiotics, whereas 9.7% provided all incorrect answers. More than half of participants (58.5%) purchased antibiotics without a prescription, mainly from medical stores or pharmacies (87.9%); this was more frequent in age group (18–29 years) and those in rural areas (p = 0.004 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Only 56.3% were aware of antibiotic resistance and received their information from medical professionals (46.3%), family members or friends (38.9%), or the media (26.1%). Less than half (42.4%) knew that antibiotics were used in farm animals. Most did not know that using antibiotics in farm animals could develop resistance (73.2%) and is banned for the purposes of growth stimulation (64.1%). This survey identifies considerable gaps in the knowledge, practices, and awareness about antibiotics among the general population in Myanmar. Continuous public education and awareness campaigns must be urgently conducted to fulfill these gaps, which would aid in promoting antibiotic stewardship, leading to combating AMR in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W4292219992,"In this paper, three monitoring sections were set up in Heilongtan Reservoir, and water samples were collected in 2019, 2020, and 2021 for the determination of physical and chemical properties such as permanganate index, chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5 ). The water quality was evaluated by the single factor pollution index method and the Nemerow pollution index method, and the temporal and spatial changes of water quality were analyzed.The single factor pollution index method determines the water quality category by identifying the single worst indicator of water quality, based on the classified water quality category. The Nemerow pollution index method emphasizes the most polluting factor while also taking into account the contribution of other factors in the assessment system, and determines the water quality category through the comprehensive pollution index. The results of the study indicate that the monitoring indicators of the monitoring sections have reached the Category III water quality standard and above in the ""Surface Water Environmental Quality Standard"" during the three years 2019 to 2021. The Heilongtan Reservoir’s water quality in 2019, 2020, and 2021 is of Category I standard, according to the results of the evaluation of water quality using the single factor pollution index technique. According to the Nemerow pollution index method’s results for evaluating water quality, the water quality pollution index for the three monitoring sections as a whole ranges from 0.36 to 0.51 in three years. The three monitoring sections’ water quality—Dongfeng Canal, Longmiao, and Sixin Village—has not changed significantly during that time, remaining clean. In terms of temporal and spatial rates of change, the temporal rate of change (T) and spatial rate of change (S) over the three years were less than 20%, and the changes in water quality at each monitoring site were not significant."

https://openalex.org/W4292219948,"Homeostasis plays a central role in our understanding how cells and organisms are able to oppose environmental disturbances and thereby maintain an internal stability. During the last two decades there has been an increased interest in using control engineering methods, especially integral control, in the analysis and design of homeostatic networks. Several reaction kinetic mechanisms have been discovered which lead to integral control. In two of them integral control is achieved, either by the removal of a single control species E by zero-order kinetics (""single-E controllers""), or by the removal of two control species by second-order kinetics (""antithetic or dual-E control""). In this paper we show results when the control species E1 and E2 in antithetic control are removed enzymatically by ping-pong or ternary-complex mechanisms. Our findings show that enzyme-catalyzed dual-E controllers can work in two control modes. In one mode, one of the two control species is active, but requires zero-order kinetics in its removal. In the other mode, both controller species are active and both are removed enzymatically. Conditions for the two control modes are put forward and biochemical examples with the structure of enzyme-catalyzed dual-E controllers are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4292219967,"The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures are affecting mental health, especially among patients with pre-existing mental disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the first wave and its aftermath of the pandemic in Germany (March-July) on psychopathology of patients diagnosed with panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and specific phobia who were on the waiting list or in current treatment at a German university-based outpatient clinic. From 108 patients contacted, forty-nine patients (45.37%) completed a retrospective survey on COVID-19 related stressors, depression, and changes in anxiety symptoms. Patients in the final sample (n = 47) reported a mild depression and significant increase in unspecific anxiety (d = .41), panic symptoms (d = .85) and specific phobia (d = .38), while social anxiety remained unaltered. Pandemic related stressors like job insecurities, familial stress and working in the health sector were significantly associated with more severe depression and increases in anxiety symptoms. High pre-pandemic symptom severity (anxiety/depression) was a risk factor, whereas meaningful work and being divorced/separated were protective factors (explained variance: 46.5% of changes in anxiety and 75.8% in depressive symptoms). In line with diathesis-stress models, patients show a positive association between stressors and symptom load. Health care systems are requested to address the needs of this vulnerable risk group by implementing timely and low-threshold interventions to prevent patients from further deterioration."
https://openalex.org/W4292219881,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a recently identified virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease is a pandemic. Although the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 have been established, the underlying mechanisms that promote severe pathology have not been thoroughly studied. A better understanding of the immune response in severe COVID-19 patients may help guide the development of therapeutic strategies and predict immuno-pathogenicity. This study was set to determine the lymphocyte and cytokine profiles associated with COVID-19 severity. A total of 43 hospitalised COVID-19 patients were recruited for the study and whole blood samples were drawn from each patient. Complete blood counts, lymphocyte subset profiles and C-reactive protein statuses of patients were determined. Cytometric bead array was performed to analyse the cytokine profiles of each patient. The demographic characteristics showed that the median age of the patients was 48.72 years, with an interquartile range from 40 to 60 years, and 69.77% of the patients were male. COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly low CD4 + lymphocyte expansion and leucocytosis augmented by elevated neutrophil and immature granulocytes. Stratification analysis revealed that reduced monocytes and elevated basophils and immature granulocytes are implicated in severe pathology. Additionally, cytokine results were noted to have significant incidences of interleukin 17A (IL-17A) expression associated with severe disease. Results from this study suggest that a systemic neutrophilic environment may preferentially skew CD4 + lymphocytes towards T-helper 17 and IL-17A promotion, thus, aggravating inflammation. Consequently, results from this study suggest broad activity immunomodulation and targeting neutrophils and blocking IL-17 production as therapeutic strategies against severe COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4292219973,"Objective Gender-affirming hormones (GAH)—the use of sex hormones to induce desired secondary sex characteristics in transgender individuals—is vital healthcare for many transgender people. Among prescribers of GAH, there is debate regarding the value of a universal requirement for an evaluation by a mental health provider prior to GAH initiation. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the range of attitudes and approaches to mental health evaluation among GAH providers in the United States. We analyzed the providers’ attitudes and base our recommendations on this analysis. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 healthcare providers who prescribe GAH across the United States. Participants were purposefully recruited using professional networks and snowball sampling to include those who require mental health evaluation and those who do not. We adapted domains from the Theoretical Domains Framework—a framework for understanding influences on health professional behavior—to inform the interviews and analysis. Guided by these domains, we iteratively coded text and identified theoretical relationships among the categories. Results While some felt a universal requirement for mental health “clearance” was necessary for the identification of appropriate candidates for GAH, others described this requirement as a form of “gatekeeping” that limits access to care. Themes we identified included providers’ ability to ascertain gender identity; concern about mental illness; GAH provider and mental health provider expertise; and provider roles. All providers appreciated the potential advantages of mental health support during GAH treatment. Conclusion Providers in our study practice on a continuum of care rather than adhering to strict rules about the requirement for mental health evaluation prior to GAH treatment. Where they fall on this continuum is influenced primarily by their perceptions of transgender identity and transition, and their interpretation of risk for significant mental illness and its association with transness. Providers who required universal evaluation by a mental health professional tended to hold essentialist, medicalized, and binary ideas of gender and transness."
https://openalex.org/W4292220003,"Indigenous families have culturally-specific strengths, priorities, and methods for assessing their children's development. Recognition and support of children's and families' strengths are important for identity, health and wellbeing. However, strengths can be missed in assessment processes developed in non-Indigenous contexts. Yolŋu are First Nations Australian peoples from North-East Arnhem Land. This study was conducted to explore Yolŋu early childhood development, assessment and support in response to concerns that Yolŋu strengths and priorities are often not recognised. The cultural and linguistic expertise of Yolŋu researchers was central in this qualitative study. Rich empirical data were collected through a form of video reflexive ethnography with six children and their extended families over seven years and through in-depth interviews with 38 other community members. An iterative process of data collection and analysis engaged Yolŋu families and researchers in a collaborative, culturally responsive research process which drew on constructivist grounded theory methods. Findings illustrate how Yolŋu children are immersed in complex layers of intertwined and continuous testing and teaching processes integrating holistic frameworks of cultural identity and connection, knowledge and practices. Yolŋu families monitor and recognise a child's development through both direct and explicit testing and through observing children closely so that children can be supported to keep learning and growing into their knowledge, strengths and identity. Yolŋu expressed concern that such learning is invisible when the child is viewed through non-Yolŋu lenses and assessed with processes and tools from outside the community. Indigenous peoples have a right to culturally congruent assessment of their children. Those who share the child's culture and language have the expertise to ensure that cultural strengths and priorities are recognised and understood."
https://openalex.org/W4292674951,"To scientifically evaluate and utilize high-oleic acid rape germplasm resources and cultivate new varieties suitable for planting in the Hunan Province, 30 local high-oleic acid rape germplasms from Hunan were used as materials. The 12 personality indices of quality, yield, and resistance were comprehensively evaluated by variability, correlation, principal component, and cluster analyses. The results of variability showed that except for oleic acid, the lowest coefficient of variation was oil content, which was 0.06. Correlation analysis showed that oil content was positively correlated with main traits such as yield per plant and oleic acid, which could be used in the early screening of high-oleic rape germplasm. The results of principal component analysis showed that the 12 personality indicators were integrated into four principal components, and the cumulative contribution rate was 62.487%. The value of comprehensive coefficient 'F' was positively correlated with the first, second, and fourth principal components and negatively correlated with the third principal component. Cluster analysis showed that 30 high-oleic rape germplasms could be divided into four categories consisting of 9 (30%), 6 (20%), 7 (23%), and 8 (27%) high-oleic rape germplasms, each with the characteristics of ""high disease resistance"", ""high yield"", ""high protein"", and ""more stability"". This study not only provides a reference basis for high-oleic rape breeding but also provides a theoretical basis for their early screening."
https://openalex.org/W4292676933,"Background Headache, a highly prevalent neurological disorder, has consistently been linked with an elevated risk of dementia. However, most studies are focused on the relationship with migraine in limited age groups. Therefore, the objective of this research was to look at the link between various type of headaches and dementias based on longitudinal population-based data. Methods and results Participants diagnosed with headache from 2002 to 2005 were selected and major covariates were collected. The diagnoses of Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, and other dementias were observed from 2006 until 2013. The adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of dementias according to headache type were calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression. A number of 470,652 participants were observed for a mean of 7.6 years (standard deviation: 1.2), for approximately 3.6 million person-years. Both tension type headache (TTH) and migraine elevated the risk of all-cause dementias (TTH, aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13–2.24; migraine, aHR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13–2.24). Headaches had a greater influence in females and non-smokers as a risk factor of dementias. Patients with migraine who consumed alcohol had a higher risk of dementia, however this was not true with TTH patients. Among participants without comorbidities, TTH patients were more susceptible to dementia than migraine patients. Headache patients had a higher proportion of females regardless of headache type and approximately 1.5 times more individuals had three or more comorbidities compared to those without headache. Conclusions Headache could be an independent predictor for subsequent dementia risk. Future studies should focus on clarifying pathogenic pathways and possible dementia-related preventive measures in headache populations."

A number of clinical data have been reported in the literature so far, but controversy exists in the collection and interpretation of the data. Particularly, there is a controversial hypothesis that nicotine might be able to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, motivated by the reported controversial clinical data and the controversial hypothesis, we carried out cytotoxicity assays in Vero E6 cells to examine the potential cytoprotective activity of nicotine against SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrated for the first time that nicotine had no significant cytoprotective activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in these cells."

This retrospective study enrolled 159 consecutive patients with HCV and compensated cirrhosis who were treated with GLE/PIB at a single center in Taiwan. Sustained virological response (SVR) and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. Among the 159 patients, 91 and 68 were treated with GLE/PIB for 8 and 12 weeks, respectively. In the per protocol analysis, both the 8- and 12-week groups achieved 100% SVR (87/87 vs. 64/64); and in the evaluable population analysis, 95.6% (87/91) of the 8-week group and 94.1% (64/68) of the 12-week group achieved SVR. The most commonly reported AEs, which included pruritus (15.4% vs. 26.5%), abdominal discomfort (9.9% vs. 5.9%), and skin rash (5.5% vs. 5.9%), were mild for the 8- and 12-week groups. Two patients in the 8-week group exhibited total bilirubin elevation over three times the upper normal limit. One of these two patients discontinued GLE/PIB treatment after 2 weeks but still achieved SVR. Both 8- and 12-week GLE/PIB treatments are safe and effective for patients of Taiwanese ethnicity with HCV and compensated cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W4292220004,"Intraspecies nucleotide sequence variation is a key to understanding the evolutionary history of a species, such as the geographic distribution and population structure. To date, numerous phylogenetic and population genetics studies have been conducted based on the sequences of a gene or an intergenic region on the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), such as cytochrome c oxidase subunits or the D-loop. To evaluate the credibility of the usage of such ‘classic’ markers, we compared the phylogenetic inferences based on the analyses of the partial and entire mtDNA sequences. Importantly, the phylogenetic reconstruction based on the short marker sequences did not necessarily reproduce the tree topologies based on the analyses of the entire mtDNA. In addition, analyses on the datasets of various organisms revealed that the analyses based on the classic markers yielded phylogenetic trees with poor confidence in all tested cases compared to the results based on full-length mtDNA. These results demonstrated that phylogenetic analyses based on complete mtDNA sequences yield more insightful results compared to those based on mitochondrial genes and segments. To ameliorate the shortcomings of the classic markers, we identified a segment of mtDNA that may be used as an ‘approximate marker’ to closely reproduce the phylogenetic inference obtained from the entire mtDNA in the case of mammalian species, which can be utilized to design amplicon-seq-based studies. Our study demonstrates the importance of the choice of mitochondrial markers for phylogenetic analyses and proposes a novel approach to choosing appropriate markers for mammalian mtDNA that reproduces the phylogenetic inferences obtained from full-length mtDNA."

https://openalex.org/W4292220045,"The COVID-19 pandemic forces people to be vaccinated as early as possible. The COVID-19 vaccination program certainly raised the medical waste volume all over the world, including in Bangladesh. Numerous recent reports showed a fragile medical waste management system in Bangladesh; during the pandemic, the situation became worse. In addition, the nation-wide ongoing COVID-19 vaccination processes have been posing an extra burden to the existing biomedical waste management in the country. Failing to proper management of this waste might be a threat to human and environmental health. Therefore, the study investigated the current COVID-19 vaccine waste management practices in Bangladesh and made a comparison to the proposed standard operating procedures of international organizations and vaccine waste management practices of two other countries (USA and India). The study was carried out through a mixed methodological approach such as qualitative and quantitative, including a questionnaire survey in 15 Upazila of 4 Districts (Dhaka, Narayanganj, Manikganj, and Gazipur) of Bangladesh. The article focused on a nation-wide legitimate COVID-19 vaccination waste estimation, strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat (SWOT) analysis and drivers, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR) framework analysis to identify the present state of medical waste management in the study area. The study found an excellent segregation system (100%) but very poor waste handling (35.5%) along with very poor syringes and sharps disposal method (open burning without buried 46.6%) and poor vials disposal method (without disinfection/open dump 52%) of vaccine waste. It is estimated that about 58 and 257.85 tonnes of syringes (with needles and packaging) and vaccine vials (Sinopharm 2 doses) waste have been generated since the mass-vaccination program started. Upon SWOT analysis, good separation techniques, poor waste management (ex-situ), enough space for management, and environmental and human health concerns were mostly identified as a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat, respectively. Finally, a DPSIR framework was prepared for vaccine waste generation and its consequences in the studied area. This study will be useful to prepare a suitable vaccination waste management system in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4292220057,"Chronic pelvic pain conditions such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) remain clinical and mechanistic enigmas. Microglia are resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that respond to changes in the gut microbiome, and studies have linked microglial activation to acute and chronic pain in a variety of models, including pelvic pain. We have previously reported that mice deficient for the lipase acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) develop pelvic allodynia and exhibit symptoms, comorbidities, and gut dysbiosis mimicking IC/BPS. Here, we assessed the role of AOAH in microglial activation and pelvic pain. RNAseq analyses using the ARCHS4 database and confocal microscopy revealed that AOAH is highly expressed in wild type microglia but at low levels in astrocytes, suggesting a functional role for AOAH in microglia. Pharmacologic ablation of CNS microglia with PLX5622 resulted in decreased pelvic allodynia in AOAH-deficient mice and resurgence of pelvic pain upon drug washout. Skeletal analyses revealed that AOAH-deficient mice have an activated microglia morphology in the medial prefrontal cortex and paraventricular nucleus, brain regions associated with pain modulation. Because microglia express Toll-like receptors and respond to microbial components, we also examine the potential role of dysbiosis in microglial activation. Consistent with our hypothesis of microglia activation by leakage of gut microbes, we observed increased serum endotoxins in AOAH-deficient mice and increased activation of cultured BV2 microglial cells by stool of AOAH-deficient mice. Together, these findings demonstrate a role for AOAH in microglial modulation of pelvic pain and thus identify a novel therapeutic target for IC/BPS."

Worldwide, the number of conditions screened for is expanding, which might affect public acceptance. In the Netherlands, participation is high (>99%), but little is known about how parents perceive NBS. This study assessed parents' views on accepting, declining and expanding NBS.A total of 804 of 6051 (13%) invited parents who participated in NBS in the Netherlands during the last two weeks of December 2019, and 48 of 1162 (4%) invited parents who declined participation in NBS in 2019 and 2020, completed a questionnaire.The most important reason for parents to participate in NBS was to prevent health complaints, whereas the most important reason to decline NBS was parents' viewpoint on life and the belief that the heel prick would be painful for the child. Compared to NBS participants, respondents who declined NBS were more actively religious, considered alternative medicine or lifestyle more important, were less inclined to vaccinate their child for infectious diseases, and reported more doubt about NBS participation (all differences p < .001). Informed choice was lower among respondents who declined NBS (44%) compared to participants in NBS (83%, p < .001), mostly due to insufficient knowledge. Of the NBS participants, 95% were positive about NBS expansion. Most NBS participants agreed to include conditions that could unintentionally reveal a diagnosis in the mother instead of the child (86%) or a condition that may not cause symptoms until later in the child's life (84%).Most participants made an informed decision to participate in NBS and are positive about screening for more conditions. Insights into parents' views on (non-)participation and expansion of NBS can help to ensure that NBS suits the population needs while safeguarding ethical principles for screening."
https://openalex.org/W4293275308,"The aim of this study was to develop and validate a method using inertial measurements units (IMUs) to determine inner-cycle parameters (e.g., cycle, poles and skis contact, and swing time) and the main sub-techniques (i.e., G2, G3 and G4) in cross-country roller ski skating on a treadmill. The developed method is based on the detection of poles and skis initial and final contacts with the ground during the cyclic movements. Thirteen well-trained athletes skied at different combinations of speed (6-24 km∙h-1) and incline (2-14%) on a treadmill using the three different sub-techniques. They were equipped with IMUs attached to their wrists and skis. Their movements were tracked using reflective markers and a multiple camera infrared system. The IMU-based method was able to detect more than 99% of the temporal events. It calculated the inner-cycle temporal parameters with a precision ranging from 19 to 66 ms, corresponding to 3.0% to 7.8% of the corresponding inner-cycle duration. The obtained precision would likely allow differentiation of skiers on different performance levels and detection of technique changes due to fatigue. Overall, this laboratory validation provides interesting possibilities also for outdoor applications."
https://openalex.org/W4292219880,"Hypertension and osteoporosis are two major disorders, which interact with each other. Specific genetic signals involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1) gene are related to high blood pressure and bone growth in giraffes. FGFRL1 is associated with cardiovascular system and bone formation. We performed an association study to investigate the role of FGFRL1 in hypertension, osteoporosis, and height determination in humans. In addition, we identified three kinds of phenotypes in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) genes and examined their association with the FGFRL1 gene. We identified 42 SNPs in the FGFRL1 gene associated with each trait. We then analyzed the potential functional annotation of each SNP. The FGFRL1 gene was found to be associated with height, hypertension, and osteoporosis, consistent with the results of a previous study. In addition, the FGF2, FGF4, FGF10, FGF18, and FGF22 genes were found to interact with the FGFRL1 gene. Our study suggests that both FGFRL1 and FGFRL1-related genes may determine the height and the prevalence of osteoporosis and hypertension in the Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W4292219919,"To investigate the role of microRNA (miR)-155 in inflammation in an in-vitro model of Graves' orbitopathy (GO). The expression levels of miR-155 were compared between GO and non-GO orbital tissues. The effects of inflammatory stimulation of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) on miR-155 expression on GO and non-GO orbital fibroblasts (OFs) were investigated. The effects of miR-155 mimics and inhibitors of inflammatory proteins and IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) expression were examined, along with those related to the knockdown of ITK with siITK transfection on inflammatory proteins. We also examined how ITK inhibitors affect miR-155 expression in GO and non-GO OFs. The expression levels of miR-155 were higher in GO orbital tissues than in non-GO tissue. The overexpression of miR-155 was induced by IL-1β and TNF-α in OFs from GO and non-GO patients. IL-1β-induced IL-6 (ICAM1) protein production was significantly reduced (increased) by miR-155 mimics and inhibitors. The mRNA and protein levels of ITK were downregulated by overexpressed miR-155 via miR-155 mimics. Knockdown of ITK via siITK transfection induced a decrease in the expression levels of ITK, IL-17, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α protein. The expression of miR-155 was significantly downregulated by treatment with ITK inhibitors and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK)/ITK dual inhibitors in a time-dependent manner. Our results indicated a potential relationship between miR-155 and ITK in the context of GO OFs. The overexpression of miR-155 repressed ITK expression and relieved inflammation. Thus, miR-155 appears to have anti-inflammatory effects in GO OFs. This discovery provides a new concept for developing GO treatment therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4292219990,"Background Elite rugby players experience poor sleep quality and quantity. This lack of sleep could compromise post-exercise recovery. Therefore, it appears central to encourage sleep in order to improve recovery kinetics. However, the effectiveness of an acute ergogenic strategy such as sleep extension on recovery has yet to be investigated among athletes. Aim To compare the effects of a single night of sleep extension to an active recovery session (CON) on post-exercise recovery kinetics. Methods In a randomised cross-over design, 10 male rugby union players participated in two evening training sessions (19:30) involving collision activity, 7-days apart. After each session, participants either extended their sleep to 10 hours or attended an early morning recovery session (07:30). Prior to (PRE), immediately after (POST 0 hour [h]), 14h (POST 14) and 36h (POST 36) post training, neuromuscular, perceptual and cognitive measures of fatigue were assessed. Objective sleep parameters were monitored two days before the training session and over the two-day recovery period. Results The training session induced substantial decreases in countermovement jump mean power and wellness across all time points, while heart rate recovery decreased at POST 0 in both conditions. Sleep extension resulted in greater total sleep time (effect size [90% confidence interval]: 5.35 [4.56 to 6.14]) but greater sleep fragmentation than CON (2.85 [2.00 to 3.70]). Between group differences highlight a faster recovery of cognitive performance following sleep extension (-1.53 [-2.33 to -0.74]) at POST 14, while autonomic function (-1.00 [-1.85 to -0.16]) and upper-body neuromuscular function (-0.78 [-1.65 to 0.08]) were better in CON. However, no difference in recovery status between groups was observed at POST 36. Conclusion The main finding of this study suggests that sleep extension could affect cognitive function positively but did not improve neuromuscular function the day after a late exercise bout."
https://openalex.org/W4292220000,"The immediate precursor to murine type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) has recently been established and named “pre-cDC1s”. Mature CD8α+ cDC1s are recognized for suppressing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) while promoting graft-versus-leukemia (GvL), however pre-cDC1s have not previously been investigated in the context of alloreactivity or anti-tumor responses. Characterization of pre-cDC1s, compared to CD8α+ cDC1s, found that a lower percentage of pre-cDC1s express PD-L1, yet express greater PD-L1 by MFI and a greater percent PIR-B, a GvHD-suppressing molecule. Functional assays were performed ex vivo following in vivo depletion of CD8α+ DCs to examine whether pre-cDC1s play a redundant role in alloreactivity. Proliferation assays revealed less allogeneic T-cell proliferation in the absence of CD8α+ cDC1s, with slightly greater CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Further, in the absence of CD8α+ cDC1s, stimulated CD8+ T-cells exhibited significantly less PD-1 expression compared to CD4+ T-cells, and alloreactive T-cell death was significantly lower, driven by reduced CD4+ T-cell death. Tumor-killing assays revealed that T-cells primed with CD8α-depleted DCs ex vivo induce greater killing of A20 B-cell leukemia cells, particularly when antigen (Ag) is limited. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional programs of these DCs, with pre-cDC1s exhibiting activated PD-1/PD-L1 signaling compared to CD8α+ cDC1s. These results indicate distinct T-cell-priming capabilities of murine pre-cDC1s compared to CD8α+ cDC1s ex vivo , with potentially clinically relevant implications in suppressing GvHD while promoting GvL responses, highlighting the need for greater investigation of murine pre-cDC1s."
https://openalex.org/W4292220018,"In Australia, research evidence has shown that Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children experience a higher burden of oral health diseases compared to other non-Indigenous children. The impact of oral health diseases on children’s functional and psychosocial outcomes led to the development of several instruments to evaluate child oral health-related quality of life (COHQoL), such as the Parental-Caregiver Perception Questionnaire (P-CPQ) and the Family Impact Scale (FIS). However, the psychometric properties of these instruments have been evaluated only in Western cultures and have not been investigated for Aboriginal children in Australia. The current study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the short-forms P-CPQ and FIS for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children aged 2–3 years. Data were collected from the South Australian Aboriginal Birth Cohort (SAABC), including 270 Aboriginal children aged 2–3 years. Network psychometric models were used to investigate dimensionality, item redundancy, structural consistency and item stability, model fit, internal consistency reliability and criterion validity. We propose an instrument named Aboriginal Children’s Oral Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (A-COHQoL). Our findings indicated that, after the exclusion of four problematic items, the A-COHQoL showed a three-dimensional structure (“Parent/Family Activities”, “COHQoL” and “Family Conflict”) with good model fit and reliability. The A-COHQoL is a psychometrically robust and sensitive instrument that is readily available for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children aged 2–3 years in Australia and can be adapted in the future for Indigenous child groups in other countries."

This study aims to explore the joint effect of smoking and body mass index (BMI) on serum lipid profiles. Methods The study consisted of 9846 Chinese adults (mean age = 49.9 years, 47.6% males, 31.2% ever smokers), based on the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Serum lipid profiles included total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein A (APO-A), and apolipoprotein B (Apo-B). The joint effect of smoking and BMI on serum lipids were examined by the four-way decomposition analysis and multivariate linear regression models. Results The four-way decomposition showed that the interplay between smoking and BMI was complicated. There was only indirect effect (the mediated effect) between smoking and BMI on TC, LDL-C and APO-B. The pure indirect effect was -0.023 for TC, -0.018 for LDL-C, and -0.009 for APO-B. For TG, HDL-C and APO-A, the interaction effect was dominant. The reference interaction (the interactive effect when the mediator is left to what it would be in the absence of exposure) was 0.474 (P &lt; 0.001) for TG, -0.245 (P = 0.002) for HDL-C, and -0.222 (P &lt; 0.001) for APO-A, respectively. The effect of BMI on TG, HDL-C and APO-A were significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers (TG: 0.151 in smokers versus 0.097 in nonsmokers, HDL-C: -0.037 versus -0.027, APO-A: -0.019 versus -0.009, P for difference &lt; 0.001 for all). Conclusion These findings illustrate the joint effects of smoking and BMI on serum lipid profiles. There were significant interaction effects of smoking and BMI on TG, HDL-C and APO-A, while BMI maybe a mediator for the association of smoking with TC, LDL-C and APO-B. The effects between them were rather complex. Smoking cessation is necessary, especially for those overweight."

Methods A retrospective analysis of 9448 patients with primary glomerular disease who were hospitalized in our hospital from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019, aged 18 years or older, and undergoing renal biopsy. Divided every 5 years into a group, a total of 4 groups (first group 2000.1.1–2004.12.31, second groups 2005.1.1–2009.12.31; third groups 2010.1.1–2014.12.31, fourth groups 2015.1.1–2019.12.31). Results ① There were more males than females, and male: female vs 1.53:1. The proportion of men in the past five years has increased compared with the previous 15 years. ② Mostly middle-aged, with a median age of 41.39 years old. The age is increasing over time. There are differences between the four groups, P &lt;0.001; ③ The most common clinical manifestations are nephrotic syndrome, followed by chronic glomerulonephritis. Occult glomerulonephritis, the proportion of patients with nephrotic syndrome increases over time, first to fourth group (40.08%&lt; 42.64% &lt; 47.08%&lt; 53.69%); ④ The most common pathology type from 2000 to 2009 was mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy was the most common type from 2010 to 2014, but the proportion of membranous nephropathy increased year by year, and it became the most common pathological type from 2015 to 2019; ⑤ The clinical and pathological manifestations of different genders are different, but there is no statistical difference. Conclusion In the past 20 years, the primary glomerular disease is mainly middle-aged. There are more men than women. The most common type of clinical manifestation is nephrotic syndrome. The pathological type is mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. Over time, the average age is increasing, and the proportion of patients with renal syndrome is increasing. IgA nephropathy is the most common pathological type from 2010 to 2014, and membranous nephropathy has become the main pathological type in the past 5 years."
https://openalex.org/W4292678170,"Introduction Mental health stigma causes a range of diverse and serious negative sequelae. Anti-stigma campaigns have largely aligned with medical theories and categorical approaches. Such campaigns have produced some improvements, but mental health stigma is still prevalent. The effect of alternative theoretical perspectives on mental health within anti-stigma campaigns has not been tested. Moreover, we do not know their effect on help-seeking intentions. Methods We conducted an online experimental pre-post study comparing the effects of two anti-stigma campaign posters on mental health stigma and help-seeking intentions. One poster adhered to the medical, categorical approach to mental health, whereas the other poster portrayed mental health problems in line with a non-categorical, continuous perspective. Results After controlling for familiarity with the campaign poster, country of residence and pre-test scores, we found no significant between-group differences in terms of help-seeking intentions and all stigma attitudes except for danger-related beliefs. That is, those who viewed the non-categorical poster reported an increased perception that people with mental health problems are dangerous. Discussion Our largely null findings may suggest the equivalence of these posters on stigma and help-seeking intentions but may also reflect the brevity of the intervention. Our findings concerning danger beliefs may reflect a Type I error, the complexities of stigma models, or the adverse effects of increased perceived contact. Further research is needed to test the effects of differing mental health paradigms on stigma and help-seeking intentions over a longer duration."
https://openalex.org/W4292681252,"Hand pollination success rate is low in yam ( Dioscorea spp.), due partly to suboptimal weather conditions. Thus, determining the most suitable time for pollination could improve the pollination success in yam breeding programs. We performed continuous hand pollination within flowering windows of D . rotundata and D . alata for two consecutive years to determine the most appropriate month, week, and hours of the day allowing maximum pollination success. In D . alata crossing block, we observed significant differences among crossing hours for pollination success (p = 0.003); morning hours (8–12 a.m.) being more conducive than afternoons (12–5 p.m.). No significant differences existed between crossing hours in D . rotundata , though the mid-day seemed optimal. For both species, the time interval 11–12 a.m. was more appropriate for crossing while 4–5 p.m. was the poorest. However, in vitro pollen germination tests showed that mid-day pollen collection (12 noon–2 p.m.) had better results than both extremes, though there were strong genotypic effects on outcomes. Pollination success rates differed significantly among months for D . alata (p &lt; 0.001) but not for D . rotundata (p &gt; 0.05). Differences in pollination success existed across weeks within flowering windows of both D . alata (p &lt; 0.001) and D . rotundata (p = 0.004). The seed production efficiency (SPE) had a similar trend as the pollination success rate. No clear pattern existed between the pollination time and the seed setting rate (SSR) or seed viability (SV), though their dynamics varied with weeks and months. This study provided an insight on the dynamics of pollination outcomes under the influence of pollination times and allows detecting months, weeks, and hours of the day when hybridization activities should be focused for better results."

The aim of the current study was to compare beliefs related to maternal health care services, science/technology, gender norms, and empowerment in states with high vs. low proportions of facility birth in Nigeria.Face-to-face interviews were performed as part of a nationally representative survey in Nigeria using a new module to measure values and beliefs related to gender and sexual and reproductive health and rights collected as part the 2018 World Values Survey. We compared beliefs related to maternal health care services, science/technology, gender norms, and empowerment between Nigerian states with facility birth proportions > 50% vs. < 25% as presented in the 2018 Nigerian Demographic Health Survey report. Pearson's chi-squared test, the independent t-test, and univariable and multivariable logistic and linear regression were used for analyses. Results were also stratified by gender.Among the 1,273 participants interviewed, 653 resided in states with high and 360 resided in states with low proportions of facility birth. There were no significant differences between the groups in perceived safety of facility birth (96% vs. 94%) and confidence in antenatal care (91% vs 94%). However, in states with low proportions of facility birth, participants had higher confidence in traditional birth attendants (61% vs. 39%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, [1.5-2.8]), men were more often perceived as the ones deciding whether a woman should give birth at a clinic (56% vs. 29%, aOR 2.4 [1.8-3.3]), and participants experienced less freedom over their own lives (56% vs. 72%, aOR 0.56 [0.41-0.76]). Most differences in responses between men and women were not statistically significant.In order to increase facility births in Nigeria and other similar contexts, transforming gender norms and increasing women's empowerment is key."
https://openalex.org/W4292685636,"Background Although frequently used in the early pandemic, data on the effectiveness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) remain mixed. We investigated the effectiveness and safety of CCP in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in real-world practices during the first two waves of the pandemic in a multi-hospital healthcare system in Texas. Methods and findings Among 11,322 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from July 1, 2020 to April 15, 2021, we included patients who received CCP and matched them with those who did not receive CCP within ±2 days of the transfusion date across sites within strata of sex, age groups, days and use of dexamethasone from hospital admission to the match date, and oxygen requirements 4–12 hours prior to the match date. Cox proportional hazards model estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effectiveness outcomes in a propensity score 1:1 matched cohort. Pre-defined safety outcomes were described. We included 1,245 patients each in the CCP treated and untreated groups. Oxygen support was required by 93% of patients at the baseline. The pre-defined primary effectiveness outcome of 28-day in-hospital all-cause mortality (HR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.66,1.10) were similar between treatment groups. Sensitivity and stratified analyses found similar null results. CCP-treated patients were less likely to be discharged alive (HR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.74, 0.91), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (HR = 1.48; 95%CI: 1.12, 1.96). Safety outcomes were rare and similar between treatment groups. Conclusion The findings in this large, matched cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and mostly requiring oxygen support at the time of treatment, do not support a clinical benefit in 28-day in-hospital all-cause mortality for CCP. Future studies should assess the potential benefits with specifically high-titer units in perhaps certain subgroups of patients (e.g. those with early disease or immunocompromised)."
https://openalex.org/W4293067480,"Pharmacological studies using propranolol suggest that if reactivation signals that new information will be learned (i.e., there is an expectation for learning) reconsolidation can be enhanced. We examined if the verbal instructions to expect new learning will enhance reconsolidation of fear memories using the post-retrieval extinction paradigm.On day one, participants (n = 48) underwent differential fear conditioning to two images (CS+ and CS-). On day two, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups; groups one and two had their memory for the CS+ reactivated (i.e., a single presentation of the CS+) 10 minutes prior to extinction, whereas group three did not have their memory reactivated but went right to extinction (no reactivation group). One reactivation group was told that they would learn something new about the images (expectation for learning group), and the other group was told that they would not learn anything new (no expectation for learning group). On day three, return of fear was measured following reinstatement (i.e., four shocks). Fear potentiated startle (FPS) and skin conductance response (SCR) were measured throughout.There was evidence of fear acquisition for participants for SCR but not FPS. With regards to reconsolidation, SCR increased for the CS+ and CS-in all groups from the end of extinction to the beginning of re-extinction (i.e., return of fear). For FPS, post-hoc tests conducted on the sub-group of participants showing fear learning showed that FPS remained stable in the two reactivation groups, but increased to the CS+, but not the CS- in the no reactivation group.These findings suggest that a verbal manipulation of the expectation for learning may not be salient enough to enhance reconsolidation. Results are discussed in relation to theories on differences in between SCR, as a measure of cognitive awareness, and FPS, as a measure of fear."
https://openalex.org/W4293068616,"Detection of Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC) is of crucial importance in the cardiology field, not only to improve the health system but also to reduce the workload of experts who analyze electrocardiograms (ECG) manually. PVC is a non-harmful common occurrence represented by extra heartbeats, whose diagnosis is not always easily identifiable, especially when done by long-term manual ECG analysis. In some cases, it may lead to disastrous consequences when associated with other pathologies. This work introduces an approach to identify PVCs using machine learning techniques without feature extraction and cross-validation techniques. In particular, a group of six classifiers has been used: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, ResNet-18, MobileNetv2, and ShuffleNet. Two types of experiments have been performed on data extracted from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database: (i) the original dataset and (ii) the balanced dataset. MobileNetv2 came in first in both experiments with high performance and promising results for PVCs’ final diagnosis. The final results showed 99.90% of accuracy in the first experiment and 99.00% in the second one, despite no feature detection techniques were used. The approach we used, which was focused on classification without using feature extraction and cross-validation techniques, allowed us to provide excellent performance and obtain better results. Finally, this research defines as first step toward understanding the explanations for deep learning models’ incorrect classifications."
https://openalex.org/W4293068873,"The actinorhizal plant Datisca glomerata (Datiscaceae, Cucurbitales) establishes a root nodule symbiosis with actinobacteria from the earliest branching symbiotic Frankia clade. A subfamily of a gene family encoding nodule-specific defensin-like cysteine-rich peptides is highly expressed in D . glomerata nodules. Phylogenetic analysis of the defensin domain showed that these defensin-like peptides share a common evolutionary origin with nodule-specific defensins from actinorhizal Fagales and with nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) from legumes. In this study, the family member with the highest expression levels, DgDef1 , was characterized. Promoter- GUS studies on transgenic hairy roots showed expression in the early stage of differentiation of infected cells, and transient expression in the nodule apex. DgDef1 contains an N-terminal signal peptide and a C-terminal acidic domain which are likely involved in subcellular targeting and do not affect peptide activity. In vitro studies with E . coli and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 showed that the defensin domain of DgDef1 has a cytotoxic effect, leading to membrane disruption with 50% lethality for S . meliloti 1021 at 20.8 μM. Analysis of the S . meliloti 1021 transcriptome showed that, at sublethal concentrations, DgDef1 induced the expression of terminal quinol oxidases, which are associated with the oxidative stress response and are also expressed during symbiosis. Overall, the changes induced by DgDef1 are reminiscent of those of some legume NCRs, suggesting that nodule-specific defensin-like peptides were part of the original root nodule toolkit and were subsequently lost in most symbiotic legumes, while being maintained in the actinorhizal lineages."

https://openalex.org/W4292219922,"Background Improving clinical reasoning education has been identified as an important strategy to reduce diagnostic error—an important cause of adverse patient outcomes. Clinical reasoning is fundamental to each specialty, yet the extent to which explicit instruction in clinical reasoning occurs across specialties in the clerkship years remains unclear. Method The Alliance for Clinical Education (ACE) Clinical Reasoning Workgroup and the Directors of Clinical Skills Courses (DOCS) Clinical Reasoning Workgroup collaborated to develop a clinical reasoning needs assessment survey. The survey questionnaire covered seven common clinical reasoning topics including illness scripts, semantic qualifiers, cognitive biases and dual process theory. Questionnaires were delivered electronically through ACE member organizations, which are primarily composed of clerkship leaders across multiple specialties. Data was collected between March of 2019 and May of 2020. Results Questionnaires were completed by 305 respondents across the six organizations. For each of the seven clinical reasoning topics, the majority of clerkship leaders (range 77.4% to 96.8%) rated them as either moderately important or extremely important to cover during the clerkship curriculum. Despite this perceived importance, these topics were not consistently covered in respondents’ clerkships (range 29.4% to 76.4%) and sometimes not covered anywhere in the clinical curriculum (range 5.1% to 22.9%). Conclusions Clerkship educators across a range of clinical specialties view clinical reasoning instruction as important, however little curricular time is allocated to formally teach the various strategies. Faculty development and restructuring of curricular time may help address this potential gap."

This was a single-institute study that included patients with NSCLC. Six driver mutations, PD-L1 status, and the outcomes of treatment were assessed. A total of 1,001 NSCLC patients were included for analysis. Overall, the PD-L1 positive (TPS ≥ 1%) and strong positive (TPS ≥ 50%) rates were 52.2% and 17.3%, respectively. As compared with wild type lung adenocarcinoma, EGFR-mutant and HER2-mutant patients had similarly low PD-L1 and strong PD-L1 positive rates. BRAF-mutant patients had numerically higher PD-L1 and strong PD-L1 positive rates. Patients with fusion mutation (ALK and ROS1) (aOR 2.32 [95% CI 1.10-4.88], P = 0.027 and 2.33 [95% CI 1.11-4.89], P = 0.026), KRAS mutation (aOR 2.58 [95% CI 1.16-5.75], P = 0.020 and 2.44 [95% CI 1.11-5.35], P = 0.026), and non-adenocarcinoma histology (aOR 2.73 [95% CI 1.72-4.34], P < 0.001 and 1.93 [95% CI 1.13-3.30], P = 0.016) all had significantly higher PD-L1 and strong PD-L1 positive rates. A trend towards longer survival was noted in ROS-1 rearranged and KRAS-mutant patients with strong PD-L1 expression who had received crizotinib and chemotherapy, respectively. In conclusion, individual driver mutations had various impacts on the PD-L1 expression of NSCLC patients. The prognostic role of PD-L1 may also be divergent amongst patients harboring different driver mutations."

This study aimed to: i) explore the experiences of hospital and community providers with delivering transitional care during the COVID-19 pandemic; ii) understand how rapid digitalization in healthcare has helped or hindered hospital-to-home transitions during the COVID-19 pandemic; and, iii) explore expectations of which elements of technology use may be sustained post-pandemic.Using a pragmatic qualitative descriptive approach, remote interviews with healthcare providers involved in hospital-to-home transitions in Ontario, Canada, were conducted. Interviews were analyzed using a team-based rapid qualitative analysis approach to generate timely results. Visual summary maps displaying key concepts/ideas were created for each interview and revised based on input from multiple team members. Maps that displayed similar concepts were then combined to create a final map, forming the themes and subthemes.Sixteen healthcare providers participated, of which 11 worked in a hospital, and five worked in a community setting. COVID-19 was reported to have profoundly impacted healthcare providers, patients, and their caregivers and influenced the communication processes.

https://openalex.org/W4292220047,"Insecurely housed women are more vulnerable to physical and mental health issues than the general population, making access to a safe abortion more difficult. Though Ethiopia has a penal code regarding safe abortion care, there has been a dearth of studies investigating the safe abortion care practice among those insecurely housed women. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the magnitude of safe abortion service uptake and its determinants among insecurely housed women who experienced abortion in southwest Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in three towns in southwest Ethiopia from May 20-July 20, 2021. A total of 124 street-involved women were included in the study. They were selected by snowball sampling technique and data was collected through a face-to-face interview. The data were entered into Epi-data Version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 21 for analysis. A bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association of independent variables with the outcome variable. The level of significance was determined at a p-value <0.05. To determine whether the model is powerful enough in identifying any significant effects that do exist on the dependent variables, a power analysis was performed via a Post-hoc Statistical Power Calculator for Multiple Regressions.The magnitude of safe abortion service utilization among insecurely housed women was found to be 27.9% [95% CI: 20.1, 34.2]. Average daily income [AOR:3.83, 95% CI: 1.38, 10.60], knowledge of safe abortion services [AOR:3.94; 95% CI: 1.27,9.24], and affordability of the service [AOR: 3.27; 95% CI:1.87, 8.41] were identified as significant predictors of safe abortion service among insecurely housed women.The magnitude of safe abortion service utilization among insecurely housed women in the study area was low. The respective town health offices and health care providers at the facility level should strive to improve awareness about safe abortion service's legal framework, and its availability. In addition, a concerted effort is needed from local administrators, NGOs, and healthcare managers to engage those insecurely housed women in income-generating activities that allow them to access safe abortion and other reproductive and maternal health services."
https://openalex.org/W4292220050,"Considerable resources are being invested in strategies to facilitate the sharing of data across domains, with the aim of addressing inefficiencies and biases in scientific research and unlocking potential for science-based innovation. Still, we know too little about what determines whether scientific researchers actually make use of the unprecedented volume of data being shared. This study characterizes the factors influencing researcher data reuse in terms of their relationship to a specific research project, and introduces subjectification as the mechanism by which these influencing factors are activated. Based on our analysis of semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 24 data reusers and intermediaries, we find that while both project-independent and project-dependent factors may have a direct effect on a single instance of data reuse, they have an indirect effect on recurring data reuse as mediated by subjectification. We integrate our findings into a model of recurring data reuse behavior that presents subjectification as the mechanism by which influencing factors are activated in a propensity to engage in data reuse. Our findings hold scientific implications for the theorization of researcher data reuse, as well as practical implications around the role of settings for subjectification in bringing about and sustaining changes in researcher behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4292220054,"In recent years, small objects detection has received extensive attention from scholars for its important value in application. Some effective methods for small objects detection have been proposed. However, the data collected in real scenes are often foggy images, so the models trained with these methods are difficult to extract discriminative object features from such images. In addition, the existing small objects detection algorithms ignore the texture information and high-level semantic information of tiny objects, which limits the improvement of detection performance. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a texture and semantic integrated small objects detection in foggy scenes. The algorithm focuses on extracting discriminative features unaffected by the environment, and obtaining texture information and high-level semantic information of small objects. Specifically, considering the adverse impact of foggy images on recognition performance, a knowledge guidance module is designed, and the discriminative features extracted from clear images by the model are used to guide the network to learn foggy images. Second, the features of high-resolution images and low-resolution images are extracted, and the adversarial learning method is adopted to train the model to give the network the ability to obtain the texture information of tiny objects from low-resolution images. Finally, an attention mechanism is constructed between feature maps of the same scale and different scales to further enrich the high-level semantic information of small objects. A large number of experiments have been conducted on data sets such as ""Cityscape to Foggy"" and ""CoCo"". The mean prediction accuracy (mAP) has reached 46.2% on ""Cityscape to Fogg"", and 33.3% on ""CoCo"", which fully proves the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W4292680650,"Background Antimicrobial residues (ABs) in foods contribute to the development of antimicrobial resistance, which is becoming a major public health concern around the world. Understanding food production practices concerning antimicrobial use and consumer awareness on the possibility of ABs in foods is necessary for developing mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the production practices and awareness among eggs and Chinese cabbage consumers in Dodoma city. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire and checklist to collect data on awareness and production practices from 420 consumers, 30 chicken egg farmers, and 30 Chinese cabbage farmers in eight city wards. Findings About 42% of consumers of eggs and Chinese cabbages were not aware of the likelihood of antimicrobial residues in these foods. The awareness was significantly influenced by the consumer’s educational level (p = 0.001) and geographical location (p = 0.045), with educated and urban consumers being 7.7 and 1.6 times more informed than their uneducated and peri-urban counterparts. Furthermore, the majority of chicken farmers raised more layers than broilers, and they all used antimicrobial drugs, mainly tetracycline and its variants, to treat and prevent diseases. The findings also revealed that many vegetable producers utilized wastes from animals treated with antimicrobials as manure to amend the soil. Conclusion In a view of the findings, a considerable number of egg and Chinese cabbage consumers in Dodoma city were unaware on the likelihood of antimicrobial residues in these foods from their production practices. All chicken farmers utilized antimicrobial drugs mainly tetracycline and its derivatives, for the treatment and prevention of diseases while vegetable producers used wastes from animals treated with antimicrobials as soil manure. Therefore, initiatives to inform farmers and consumers about the possibility of antimicrobial residues in these foods and their related public health risks upon long-term consumption are strongly advised."
https://openalex.org/W4292681368,"The diversity among bacteriophages depends on different factors like ecology, temperature conditions and genetic pool. Current study focused on isolation, identification and diversity of phages from 34 sewage water samples collected from two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), King Saud University wastewater treatment plants (KSU-WWTP) and Manfoha wastewater treatment plants (MN-WWTP) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Samples were analyzed by PCR and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Siphoviridae , Podoviridae and Myoviridae families were detected by family-specific PCR and highest prevalence of Myoviridae 29.40% was found at MN-WWTP followed by 11.76% at KSU-WWTP. Siphoviridae was detected 11.76% at MN-WWTP and 5.88% at KSU-WWTP. Lowest prevalence for Podoviridae family (5.88%) was recorded at MN-WWTP. Significant influence of temporal variations on prevalence of Myoviridae and Siphoviridae was detected in both WWTP and MN-WWTP, respectively. Highest phage prevalence was obtained in August (75%), followed by September (50%). Highest phage prevalence was recorded at a temperature range of 29–33°C. Significant influence of temperature on the prevalence of Myoviridae phages was detected at MN-WWTP. Four bacteriophages with various abundance levels were identified by NGS. Cronobacter virus Esp2949-1 was found first time with highest abundance (4.41%) in wastewater of Riyadh. Bordetella virus BPP1 (4.14%), Dickeya virus Limestone (1.55%) and Ralstonia virus RSA1 (1.04%) were also detected from samples of MN-WWTP. Highest occurrence of Bordetella virus BPP1 (67%) and (33.33%) was recorded at KSU-WWTP and MN-WWTP, respectively. Highest Bordetella virus BPP1 occurrence was recorded in September (50%) followed by August (40%). The findings of study showed new insights of phage diversity from wastewater sources and further large-scale data studies are suggested for comprehensive understanding."
https://openalex.org/W4292681409,"Women exposed to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) often do not utilize maternal health care optimally both because of stigma and other social problems. The current study aims to explore an association between maternal healthcare seeking and violence exposure among Ethiopian women and to assess if educational attainment and wealth status moderate this association.The analyses included 2836 (weighted) currently married women with one live birth. We focus on the five years preceding the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) who participate, in the domestic violence sub-study. Exposure was determined by maternal reports of physical, emotional, sexual IPV or any form of IPV. The utilization of antenatal care (ANC) and place of delivery were used as proxy outcome variables for uptake of skilled maternal healthcare utilization. Women's education attainment and wealth status were selected as potential moderators, as they can enable women with psychological and financial resources to counteract impact of IPV. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between spousal IPV and maternal health outcomes. Moderation effects by education and wealth status were tested, and the data stratified. Using statistical software Stata MP 16.1, the restricted maximum likelihood method, we obtained the model estimates.About 27.5% of the women who reported exposure to any form of IPV had a health facility delivery. While 23.4% and 22.4% visited four or more antenatal care services among mothers exposed to emotional IPV and sexual IPV, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, only the association between maternal exposure to emotional IPV and adequate use of ANC was statistically significant (OR = 0.73, (95% CI:0.56-0.95)). But we found no significant association between IPV and utilization of health facility delivery. Some moderation effects of education and wealth in the association between IPV and maternal healthcare service utilization outcome were found.Exposure to emotional IPV was associated with poor uptake of maternal health care service utilization for married Ethiopian women. While developing interventions to improve women's maternal healthcare service use, it is crucial to consider the effects of socio-economic variables that moderate the association especially with the intersection of IPV."
https://openalex.org/W4292683812,"Retail store prices are frequently set to either a just-below (e.g., $1.99) or rounded to (e.g., $2.00) integer levels. Previous studies proposed two price-perception effects that may underly such psychological pricing strategies. First, the left-digit effect (LDE) assumes consumers read prices left-to-right. Cognitive limitations let consumers overweight the impact of digits on the left side of the price while underweighting digits on the right side of the price. This effect appears to conflict with the contradictory perceptual fluency effect (PFE), which proposes that a rounded price is more perceptual fluent and, thus, more attractive to consumers. To address these paradoxical effects, we conducted an online experiment with 266 participants making a total of 4788 purchasing decisions where we systematically varied the purchasing prices of otherwise identical lottery tickets across two price levels. Against expectations, we found no support for either of the two price-perception effects. We propose three possible explanations of these null results."
https://openalex.org/W4292686309,"Rapid advancements in automated genomic technologies have uncovered many unique findings about the turtle genome and its associated features including olfactory gene expansions and duplications of toll-like receptors. However, despite the advent of large-scale sequencing, assembly, and annotation, about 40-50% of genes in eukaryotic genomes are left without functional annotation, severely limiting our knowledge of the biological information of genes. Additionally, these automated processes are prone to errors since draft genomes consist of several disconnected scaffolds whose order is unknown; erroneous draft assemblies may also be contaminated with foreign sequences and propagate to cause errors in annotation. Many of these automated annotations are thus incomplete and inaccurate, highlighting the need for functional annotation to link gene sequences to biological identity. In this study, we have functionally annotated two genes of the red-bellied short-neck turtle (Emydura subglobosa), a member of the relatively understudied pleurodire lineage of turtles. We improved upon initial ab initio gene predictions through homology-based evidence and generated refined consensus gene models. Through functional, localization, and structural analyses of the predicted proteins, we discovered conserved putative genes encoding mitochondrial proteins that play a role in C21-steroid hormone biosynthetic processes and fatty acid catabolism-both of which are distantly related by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and share similar metabolic pathways. Overall, these findings further our knowledge about the genetic features underlying turtle physiology, morphology, and longevity, which have important implications for the treatment of human diseases and evolutionary studies."

https://openalex.org/W4293067958,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and trauma have been linked to decreased psychosocial and physiological health functioning. While various individual and community-level interventions to address ACEs have been reported, one novel approach that has not been explored in detail is a community-engaged causal loop diagramming project, or systems mapping project (SMP), in which diverse stakeholders work together to document the forces that are creating the outcomes and patterns within the community. To better document and understand the impact of participation in an SMP, we conducted in-depth, qualitative interviews with 16 stakeholders who were involved in a systems-mapping process facilitated by a local nonprofit in Eastern North Carolina. We used an iterative, content analysis coding process to generate and analyze themes from these interviews. Three major themes emerged: 1) Recognition and understanding of own trauma, 2) Trauma as both a community issue and an individual issue, and 3) Systems-mapping as a conceptual tool with practical benefits. All participants strongly recommended the systems-mapping approach to other communities and believed that it is a valuable tool for empowerment and provided several considerations for future organizers of similar systems-mapping projects. Our findings suggest that systems mapping is a feasible, transferable, and promising modality for understanding and addressing ACEs at the individual, interpersonal, and community-levels, as well as for putting community voices at the forefront of efforts to address ACEs."
